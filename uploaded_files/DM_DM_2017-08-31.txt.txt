Asian markets rebound after North Korea-fuelled losses
	
AFP: Asian traders returned to buying Wednesday, reversing the previous days losses as Donald Trumps measured response to North Koreas missile launch and upbeat US data restored a semblance of calmto markets.
The rush to the sidelines that followed Pyongyangs launch of a rocket over Japan Tuesday abated through the day as initial fears subsided, while the dollar clawed back losses against the yen and euro.
While Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called the launch an unprecedented, serious and grave threat, Trump -- who had warned of fire and fury over a previous missile test -- said only that all options were on the table.
North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un has promised more missile flights over Japan, insisting his nuclear-armed nations provocation was a mere curtain-raiser, in the face of UN condemnation and US warnings of severe repercussions.
But while analysts said the North Korea threat was still apparent, unease had been soothed by the fact that Trump and Abe were sticking to a diplomatic line and the UN SecurityCouncil had met.
With a toned-down President Trump and the UN Security Council in closed-door meetings with economic sanctions the preferred option, the world just feels like a safer place today, and investors are relishing this respite, said OANDA head of Asia-Pacific trading Stephen Innes. On equity markets Seoul -- which ended down 0.2 percent Tuesday after losing more than one percent in the morning -- added 0.3 percent and Tokyos Nikkei finished 0.7 percent higher, helped by a weaker yen.
Hong Kong rallied 1.2 percent in the afternoon and Singapore put on 0.5 percent, while Sydney, Wellington, and Taipei closed higher. However, Shanghai ended 0.1 percent down after late selling.
In early European trade London and Paris each rose 0.5 percent and Frankfurt added 0.7 percent. All three had ended sharply loweron Tuesday.
Dollar bounce
The risk off sentiment that overshadowed markets after the launch of yet another missile from North Korea didnt even last 24 hours, David de Garis, director at National Australia Bank, said in a commentary.
The dollar plunged Tuesday to as low as 108.50 Yen as dealers rushed for safe investments but managed to bounced back later in the day and in early Asian trade was at 110 yen. The greenback also picked up against the euro, a day after the single currency broke above $1.2000 for the first time since January 2015. The euro has been boosted by expectations the European Central Bank will soon start cutting down its stimulus, while talk of fresh Federal Reserve interest rate rises has eased.
The US unit was supported by bargain-buying and a strong consumer confidence reading, while dealers are upbeat about upcoming US jobs data on Friday.
However, Satou Masakazu, senior analyst at Gaitame Online, said in the long run, the euro-buying sentiment remains strong.
Oil prices remain subdued by Hurricane Harveys impact on Texas and the crude sector.
Both main contracts ticked down marginally Wednesday a day after eking out minor gains and traders are fearful of a long-term shutdown of refining capacity in the oil-rich Gulf Coast region.

## Title: Aswatuna our their voices

Aswatuna our their voices
	

The deliberately un-rhythmic overtones, the overdrawn tonal improvisations, and the swift blend of tabla and clapping suggest a studied primitiveness, as though youre listening to the first band the world inherited. 
Part of the pleasure of listening to Qawwali is this form of primitiveness. For sheer transcendental power I cant think of another musical genre because of how frequently Ive come across it nearly everywhere, on radio, on film, on television. I am the Truth! Mansur Al-Hallaj, one of the many Sufi mystics who inspired Qawwali, once exhorted. He was condemned, cursed, praised, and even murdered ambivalently. Ambivalence is a peculiar quality in the arts, and probably no other musical form has been adorned with it so much. 
Most spiritual songs (it would be facile to consider a Qawwali session as a series of songs, but never mind that) celebrate impermanence, the hollow underpinnings of secularism, the clash between life and afterlife. The ghazal, naat, hamd, and marsiya, the most easily recognisable Qawwalis, are known for their celebration of BOTH the spiritual and the secular, because of which they have retained that quality of ambivalence. Its not poetry in motion, its ecstasy in motion. So when a group of Sri Lankans, Pakistanis, Indians, and an American come together to breathe life into the genre in Sri Lanka, it should be regarded as more than an exercise in aesthetics. 
One cant talk about an art form thats inspired so much censure and at the same time ecstasy without defending it, without listening to or watching it and appreciating how much of an impact it can have and has had on audiences. Aswatuna unfolded on Saturday, August 19 at the Russian Cultural Centre and on Sunday, August 20 at the Sooriya Village to rapt audiences. Im less interested, however, in the event itself, which I unfortunately couldnt attend, than in the prologue, the what-led-to-it, which compels me to defend the idea behind it. We are so enraptured by musical concerts and shows that we cant seem to differentiate between them. We are, simply put, perpetually hungry for a new concert, a new show. I found the latter with Aswatuna. 
But first, what does Aswatuna mean Basically, it translates to Our Voices. Whose, though Yours Mine The answer, obviously, is Everybodys, because its organisers have sought to bring together such a project in the hopes of building communities, reinvigorate the spirit of camaraderie thats fast disappearing (because music is no longer considered a language, rather an aesthetic to be discarded, condemned, or listened to at ones beck and call). To this end its worthwhile bringing up the names of those organisers, because in their story one can trace the evolution of their event: Haadiya Galely, Andr de Quadros, Adeel Mirza, Shahid Shabaz. 
It all began with an audition held at Alethea International School which was attended by only three people. This was last May, three months back. The idea was to create a Qawwali band in Sri Lanka, an idea conceived in part by Professor de Quadros (a professor of music who teaches in America, whose website informs us that hes a conductor, ethnomusicologist, music educator, writer, and human rights activist). 
Eventually with those three hopefuls came the premier and most popular Sri Lankan
Sufi Ensemble, Naqshbandi. The only problem, however, was that none of them, even with their musical experience, could pitch properly. The professor was nervous and not a little disconcerted, but the lady who had brought them together, Haadiya Galely, was not put off: I told him to try them out. In the end she was vindicated: Its amazing what a few weeks and months did. Almost overnight they transformed, though we were left with certain minor issues which didnt bother us. And to this group came another major name: Shahid Shabaz, winner of The Voice of UAE. 
Not being a connoisseur in music by any stretch of the imagination, I deplore my inability to appreciate the subtle nuances and sincerity which would have gone into an enterprise as ambitious as this. Suffice it to say, then, that I have heard the band, Aswatuna, the way it should be heard: on the floor, reminiscent of the paduru party format which weve misconceived. Its a virtually unassailable blend of vivacity and spirituality, which transcends categorisation and becomes its own standard, its own benchmark, to be emulated everywhere. How many Indian movies have we watched where the songs were obviously transposed ghazals Closer to home, how many must-sing-along-to songs in the Jothipala-Muttusamy tradition have borrowed from Qawwalis in general The connections, as always, were hard not to infer, to appreciate. They added more colour to an otherwise banal Colombo evening. 
Professor Quadros involvement in this whole affair merits more than a passing glance. As Ive mentioned before, hes more than a musicologist. His work has primarily been in cross-cultural musical ensembles, or the ability of two worlds coming together through music. In 2010 he brought Israeli and Pakistani choral musicians together, not in some air-conditioned hall in comfortably neutral territory but at the heartland of conflict in the Middle-East, East Jerusalem. Having taught in Bombay and in Boston, having traversed through America, India, Central Asia, and even Latin America, he has, from what I have heard and read, never wavered in his belief in the power of music to bring everyone together, to celebrate commonalities. 
And in opting for Qawwali, a genre thats raised so much flak, so much censure, and thats traceable in turn to a poetic form whose proponents have been imprisoned, exiled, tortured, and killed in the name of divinity (the same divinity which these proponents have, ironically, praised and apotheosised), his choice has been tense, terse, and spot on. After all, reconciliation in a troubled land shouldnt call for compromise: its tenor must be absolute, its profusion unconditional. From the responses I was able to glean of those who attended both events, on Saturday and Sunday, I can concede this much: the organisers have delivered, and what theyve delivered goes beyond anything that academic texts can hope to do justice to. 
Aswatuna refers to a voice, yours, mine, his, hers, and ours. Perhaps thats the best way I can conclude, sum up, and in the process pay my respects to the entire project.

Bank of Ceylon bestowed Master Brand status
	
The Bank of Ceylon was conferred the Master Brand status for the year 2017-2018 by the CMO Council Asia at the ceremony held at Taj Samudra Hotel Colombo recently.
Being named as the number-one brand in the country for over nine consecutive years by the Brand Finance Sri Lanka, the Bank of Ceylon currently holds the highest brand value in the country which is Rs.40 billion.
Since its inception, the BOC brand has been strategically adapting its products and services portfolio with a good understanding of future social and economic trends that requires tailor-made banking and financial services.
Currently, Bank of Ceylon is the only Sri Lankan bank to own a trillion triplet in the balance sheet. With the current outlook on the banks asset growth rate at seven percent, the bank has planned to enhance its asset base up to two trillion Rupees by 2019- yet another milestone in the Sri Lankan banking industry. Such capabilities encompasses great responsibilities on the Bank of Ceylon to serve all stakeholders including its very diverse customer base from individuals to businesses and organizations from different geographic locations and economic strata. The banks approach to cater to the very dynamic banking needs of its customer base has been the key factor behind BOC brands 78-year-long success. With the time-tested vision as Bankers to the Nation, brand BOC has delivered the best results for its true stakeholders, citizens and the Government of Sri Lanka as a state owned bank.
BOCs contribution does not end simply on achieving financial performance. It plays a major role in financial inclusion, developing individuals from all walks of lives, Micro and SME entrepreneur development and developing large-scale corporate businesses. Working in line with the government mandate to reach the unbanked population, and get youth and women engaged in development, the Bank of Ceylon took bold and conscious strategic decisions in invest on sustainable growth of these groups.
Further contributing towards the banks inherent responsibility towards National Economic development, the bank made a direct contribution towards the Government of Sri Lanka by way of significant payment of dividends and taxes in 2016, corresponding to its profit increase.
This was a substantial growth in contribution made to the government and highest made by a Sri Lankan business entity to the state. The ultimate benefits of the banks contribution to the government will cascade down to all citizens by means of government economic and infrastructure development and welfare programmes.

Bribery, corruption must not be tolerated: Foreign Sec.
	
Bribery, corruption and fraud must be countered without being tolerated as they feed organized crime including human trafficking by discouraging honest and accountable governance, Foreign Affairs Ministry Secretary Prasad Kariyawasam said.
Delivering the Valedictory Speech at the Colombo Defence Seminar under the theme Countering Violent Extremism: Global Trends on Tuesday, Mr. Kariyawasam said corruption makes ordinary people feel that the system is rigged against them and that the people in power are stealing what is rightfully theirs.
Corruption, injustice and humiliation makes people easy prey for extremists and make communities ripe for extremist recruitment. Eradicating corruption and creating confidence in the integrity of government institutions are important ingredients for preventing violent extremism, he said.
He said it was important to build trust in government at all levels including in law enforcement agencies and the security forces that are meant to protect people and build confidence in the judiciary. Political grievances must be addressed as these are breeding grounds that extremists exploit. When people feel oppressed, and their human rights are denied, it creates an environment that can be ripe for recruitment, he said.
Meanwhile, he said Sri Lankan defence forces should now adapt to meet new challenges in close partnership with their regional counterparts and beyond to combat and counter terrorism and violent extremism.
The Foreign Secretary also said Sri Lanka had been through the most extreme forms of violence despite being blessed by the four main religions in the world. The cycles of violence that we had witnessed and experienced could help us to perfect the art of making our people realise the importance of embracing peace and peaceful coexistence as a way of life while abandoning violence as an option, forever, he said.

## Title: Can heavy fines force speedsters out of the fast lane

Can heavy fines force speedsters out of the fast lane
	
Nobody, interested in seeing better discipline in our roads, can criticize the Rupees Twenty five thousand (25,000) fine which will be enforced for offences like driving under the influence of liquor or driving at excessive speeds. However, unless the prevalent mode of enforcing fines is changed, the enhanced fines will only serve to provide more opportunities for corrupt elements in the police service. 
The breathalyzer test is based on the rapid reduction by alcohol in the presence of silver nitrate catalyst of reddish orange dichromate to green chromic ion, obtaining the level of alcohol in the exhaled air from a comparison of colours and relating it to alcohol in the blood. Since what impairs your driving isnt the alcohol in your breath (alveolar air), but the alcohol in your blood which affects your brain, Henrys Law is used to relate the two. At normal body temperature, 2100 ml of exhaled air is believed to have the same weight of alcohol found in 1 ml of blood. A value of 0.08% of alcohol in your blood puts you into the driving under influence category and makes you liable to a charge. 
However there are several problems in using the relationship. The 2100 ml is an average and although humans have been recorded with values as low as 1100 ml to as high as 3000 ml, most fall between 1900 and 2400 ml. A driver with a lower value is at a disadvantage in the breathalyzer test while one with the higher level has an advantage as it will show a value less than true blood alcohol level. Furthermore, a driver with fever will have a boost in alveolar alcohol (20% more if body temperature is 37oC) compared with the true blood alcohol. 
The reading also depends on the proportion of red cells in blood which can vary in humans by about + 6% as this affects the amount of water in the blood. A higher value than the average 47% for males will lead to a higher breathalyzer reading, although there is an advantage for females as their average of 42% will routinely give them a lower reading. Those tested immediately after consuming liquor or even arishtas (Ayurveda medicine in liquid form) will show a higher reading. The technique used abroad is to conduct the test 15 min after being stopped. Those who hold their breath just before the test will show higher readings, while rapid inhalation/exhalation a few times before the test will give a slightly lower reading. 
Apart from these, diabetics, with uncontrolled sugar levels exhaling ketones and smokers exhaling acetaldehyde, can show higher breathalyzer values in the cheaper semiconductor based breathalyzers. 
Since the test is flawed, the option of challenging it with a blood test must be available if these high fines are introduced, although one does not know how practical it is. Another option would be to enforce the higher fines only when a breathalyzer shows blood alcohol levels of over 0.11% rather than 0.08% to adjust for the possible flaws in the method and have the existing lower fine for 0.08-0.11% levels. 
All this assumes that breathalyzers are regularly calibrated or checked for their accuracy, unfortunately something not taken seriously in Sri Lanka. Since no work has been done, we also dont know whether the assumptions in breathalyzer manufacture mentioned above based on Western samples is valid for a South Asian population. 
However the best way to avoid being charged is of course to not drive after drinks. In many countries, clubs serving liquor provide a fee based driver service to take you and your vehicle home. Since many Sri Lankan have bites or meals after drinks they have an advantage as absorption of alcohol is slowed by food and if the post-drinking meal consumption period is about 2 hours, the alcohol consumed by most social drinkers would have reduced to acceptable level. 
The problem with enforcing higher fines for speeding is that the absence of camera coordinated speed checks allows room for corrupt practices. Unfortunately there are some policemen who keep a recorded high speed value on their radar gun and confront subsequent motorists (usually bus drivers) with the old readings in an effort to be paid to prevent being given a ticket. This happened to me several years ago, but not during the recent past and it would appear according to the personal experience of an election commissioner fairly prevalent even now on the A9.
Camera based evidence is used abroad and heavy fines should be introduced only after such an unambiguous method is introduced. Another possibility is the use of radar guns which can provide a printout to the motorist of the speed and the time and date of occurrence and an automatic clearing of the display when the printout is removed, if such radar guns exist. 
Whatever it is, if the aim of the Government is to improve driving habits in Sri Lanka, the mere increase in fines to extremely high levels may not have the desired impact.

The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) said today the government should represent on behalf of the rights of former army commander Jagath Jayasuriya as he was a government servant and had acted legally according to international laws.
JHU General Secretary and Minister Champika Ranawaka told a news conference that General (Rtd) Jayasuriya did not carry out a private duty but he carried out a collective responsibility as an army officer of the Sri Lanka Army belonging to the legally and democratically elected government.
The government should intervene in the case filed against the former army commander. He performed a duty of the army. The government has a responsibility to represent on behalf of this government servant
The duty he performed as the Vanni commander is legal and conforms to local and international laws. He carried out a collective responsibility to protect the President, Cabinet and the people in the country. He contributed to bring in peace to the country, he said.
He said if there were moves to file war crime allegations against the army heads, people in the country would be compelled to demand legal actions against 12,000 LTTEers in Sri Lanka.
About 12,000 LTTErs who surrendered to the army during the war were released by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa without any observation or proper procedure. People in the country would be compelled to demand legal action against them instead of reconciliation if army heads were taken before court for war crimes. It is a regrettable situation, he said.
When asked about the incident of distributing leaflets by a group attached to the LTTE in Jaffna on Wednesday, he said he was unaware if it was done by the LTTE and added that such moves should be prevented without any mercy. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Heavy rains kill five in Indias  Mumbai
	

At least five people were killed as heavy monsoon rain deluged Indias financial capital Mumbai, causing transport chaos and forcing schools and many offices to close on Wednesday. The coastal city of more than 20 million people is the latest to be hit by floods that have ravaged South Asia this monsoon season, affecting millions of people across India, Nepal and Bangladesh and killing over 1,200. Authorities in Mumbai said at least five people had died since the intense rainfall began on Tuesday, making roads impassable and briefly shutting the suburban rail network on which millions of commuters depend. 
Five people have died in the Mumbai floods. Four of them including two children died due to wall collapse in the slums and another person died due to electric shock, Tanaji Kamble, a local government official, told AFP.  Kamble said the rains had eased by Wednesday. We are monitoring the safety situation across the city and things are returning to normal. Cars were submerged and commuters waded through waist-deep water on Tuesday evening.

Her dream turned into a nightmare for her helpers
	
An incident where a woman's dream woke up her neighbours as well as brought her relatives to her house at 4 in the morning was reported recently from Dankotuwa.
The woman's husband had set off in his vehicle at 3 a.m to buy fish and after setting the alarm for the time she wanted to get up the woman in question had fallen into a deep sleep. In a dream she had seen her husband's vehicle crash into a bus and woke up screaming. The woman then took a call to her husband's mobile phone but received no answer.
She was so worried that the dream was real that she proceeded to call out to her neighbours to come to her aid. She had also telephoned her relatives and pleaded with them to come to come there to help her locate the place where the accident involving her husband had occurred. It was 4 a.m in the morning.
Fearing the worst she asked those who had come to her aid to accompany her to the town to check on her husband's whereabouts.
However, try as they might they were unable to locate the crash-site she had seen in her dream. Thereafter they had given up the search and returned back to where the woman lived. On their way back they were greeted with the sight of the woman's husband driving back home safe and sound, bringing with him the fish that was bought for an alms-giving. Realising that the woman had wasted their time because of what she had seen in a stupid dream and on a holiday at that, they went their separate ways cursing her for her haste.

Hutch introduces 24/7 ATM reloads for HNB customers
	
Hutch, Sri Lankas fastest growing mobile broadband operator recently introduced 24/7 reload service through the island wide ATMs, Cash Deposit Machines (CDM) and Kiosks network of Hatton National Bank (HNB).
This is another result of the companys ongoing bid to bring ultimate convenience to its customers.
Hutch users who bank with HNB can now top-up their mobile accounts from over 500 HNB ATM locations across the country. Not only HNB customers, any Hutch user can do the same using HNB CDM/Kiosks network using cash. Moreover, Hutch top-ups and bill payments can be made using HNB online banking. These self-service top-up mechanisms which are available 24hrs of the day is particularly useful when it difficult to access a retail outlet during nights or weekends.

Nations Trust Bank CEO talks on next-gen banking
	
Nations Trust Bank PLC strongly believes that change is needed within the organisation and the financial services sector as a whole for it to survive and thrive in the future.
Nations Trust Bank CEO Renuka Fernando said: Globally there is significant disruption happening in the financial services industry, especially in the commercial banking sector because of innovative technology. Products and services which are not compliant to operate within the financial services regulatory framework such as payment wallets and mobile payment platforms are now competing directly in the same space. As such, banks are now beginning to realise that they will need to disrupt their own business models and think different if they are to keep pace with these trends.
Renuka believes that technology is reshaping the way the bank interacts and engages with its customers, and that some industries have managed to embrace these changes far more effectively than others. Although banks have been slow to adapt to the digital environment, perhaps due to legacy systems and the regulatory framework in which they operate, it can be seen that a lot of transactions that happened through manual processes are being rapidly automated. Technologies in financial transactions have brought enormous customer convenience and ease, through mobile and online channels as well as speed and accuracy which could not have been achieved manually,she explained.
In Sri Lanka, Im really proud to say that Nations Trust Bank has introduced the first fully digital banking proposition through our recently launched FriMi which is a fully-fledged bank account which is also a direct mobile payment and money transfer platform available for day-to-day transactionsand purchases.
We will continue to enhance this digital offer with other banking products being added in the future, she continued. Nations Trust Bank has always considered customer service as the key to success and have woven its entire proposition based on bringing convenience to customers and understanding them better.
But now we are determined to take this to a whole new level, using data analytics and technology to help understand customers intimately and design their experience with the bank based on their personal preferences and requirements.
We are converting our bank to change the way we understand and service our customers from a product and channel based experience to a holistic seamless experience across our entire bank. Renuka further described that, today a lot of choice is given to customers, on how they can interact with the bank, from traditional channels, call centres, electronic channels and digital channels like mobile, online and social media.
She believes that customers should be able to choose from a mix of channels they are comfortable with and be able to have an omni channel experience which will enable them to start the interaction with one channel and end it with another absolutely seamlessly.
Renuka concluded by stating: This cant be done in isolation without transforming the way we work internally.
So, we have already started re-engineering our processes which include bringing robotics into some of our processes and bringing innovative, collaborative technology which will help us to integrate the way we service and manage our customers.
It also means that we will need to re-skill our staff to think and work differently and more proactively, using these technology tools.
Technology brought to our customers in a simple, intuitive and easy to use manner and the way we personalise our customer experience will be the keys to succeeding in the future.

REUTERS, 30th AUGUST, 2017- One hundred days after militants loyal to Islamic State took over parts of a southern Philippine city, the military is confident the end is in sight for what has been its biggest security crisis in years.
After a lightning strike on May 23 on Marawi City, the Dawla Islamiya rebel alliance has held out against daily artillery bombardment and air strikes by jets and bombers, and its snipers remain placed in the rubble of the citys business district.
But now, says Romeo Brawner, deputy commander of the militarys Marawi task force, rebel-held areas are shrinking, and there are signs the fighters are low on food and ammunition, and starting to flag.

Responding the query as to how and where Rs.10 million was allocated from the Presidential Fund for the surgery of Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne in Singapore, Minister Senaratne said that it was Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who ordered him to go abroad for the operation.
Addressing the media on Wednesday during the cabinet briefing, Dr. Senaratne said although he had wished to undergo the surgery in Sri Lanka, the Premier had compelled his son to take Minister Senaratna elsewhere for the surgery.
When the Premier said that he would settle the accounts, I had to obey him. I do not want to waste the money of the poor. If I had wanted, I could have done it easily. But since the order came from above, I did so, Mr. Senarantna said.
He proceeded to say that he was not the only MP to go abroad for medical purposes and therefore it was not reasonable to accuse him for allocating money from the Presidential Fund.
There was a rumour spreading that some had engaged in exorcism to curse me. The PM had a fear that the same fate of Ven. Sobitha Thera would befall me. Thats why he commanded my family members to take me abroad for the operation. Therefore, dont misinterpret the incident, he added.(Sheain Fernandopulle)

## Title: PTL IT executive told CID he lied: ASG Dappula de Livera

PTL IT executive told CID he lied: ASG Dappula de Livera
	
Additional Solicitor General Dappaula de Livera yesterday told the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) that Perpetual Treasuries Ltd's IT executive Sachith Devathantri had admitted to the CID yesterday that he had lied when making the previous statement to CID officials of the PCoI regarding the PTLs phone recording system.
ASG Livera said Mr. Devathantri was summoned again to the PCoI to be further questioned by the CID on the matter last morning. The ASG said during yesterdays questioning the IT person has admitted that he had lied in his previous statement to the CID.
On an earlier occasion, Mr. Devathantri was summoned at the PCoI and a statement recorded by the CID officers.
Meanwhile, Presidents Counsel Kalinga Indatissa cross-examined Chief Engineer of Metropolitan Ltd, Chief Examiner Nalin Dharmaratne with regard to the evidence he provided to the PCoI about the voice recording system.
Presidents Counsel Anuja Premaratne appearing for Arjun Aloysius also cross-examined the witness.
During the Cross-examination, the witness was seen uncertain with regard to specific technical questions put forward by the Presidents Counsel.
According to the witness, Metropolitan Ltd had initially placed a voice recording system (Voice Logger System) on May 18, 2015 with eight ports with the capacity of storing caller details and voice recordings.
This system was included with a main computer given by Metropolitan in which all the data was stored as voice recordings (wave files) and caller details.
However, during the cross examination it was revealed that after the installation PTL had complained on June 4, 2015 about the system that there were errors in the recording system, which lacked the capacity to record all digits of outgoing numbers.
The witness admitted during cross-examination that Metropolitan Ltd was unable to solve the problem for a certain period and only sorted it out in December 2015 with the assistance of Metropolitans mother company in India.
The witness said that PTL had not complained thereafter about any major issues regard the system.
Later, in September 2016, Metropolitan Ltd had again installed another 16 ports in the system on the request of PTL.
It was revealed that these 24 ports were linked with PTLs extensions in the phone recording system.
During the cross-examination, the witness seemed unaware about certain maters raised by Counsel Indatissa PC with reference to the contract agreement and service agreement of PTL and Metropolitan.
When leading evidence of the witness, it was explained that when the Metropolitan's chief engineer examined the system on August 26, 2017 at PTL they could not find previous data relating to phone recordings.
Thereafter, they had obtained the assistance of its Indian Company through a remote logging method, accessing the system online. Subsequently, the Indian Mother Company had sent a report on the system.
The witness admitted that Metropolitan Ltd had no specialist technical officer to examine matters which were required by the Commission and that they had asked assistance from its mother company.
The report said the system had been re-installed on July 6, 2017. Later, on July 20 the previous voice recording data (wave files) had been re-placed in the data base and a basic configuration done on July 21 to operate the system.
It was also revealed that the July 21 configuration was only a basic one and still the system did not have the capability to record Caller Line Identification (CLI) in the system without doing an advanced configuration.
It was also revealed that this basic configuration and re-installation had been done by PTL without the assistance of Metropolitan Limited.
However, it was explained that PTL had shifted its office to a different address on July 3, 2017. It was revealed that at the new place, PTL had identified that the computer hard disk relating to the recording system had crashed for some reason.
Thereafter they had replaced a new hard disk in the computer and re-installed the system on July 6, 2017 -- the day that PTL was suspended from being a Primary Dealer in Government Securities.
Presidents Counsel Indatissa who appeared for PTL CEO Kasun Palisena was of the view that Metropoltan Chief Engineers testimony was not independent evidence because the witness was solely relying on their Indian mother companys report.
PC Indatissa said the Indian mother company had only examined the system remotely by accessing online and provided details. He was of the view that such inspection was only a preliminary stage of a forensic examination; therefore a proper forensic examination has to be done to ascertain whether PTL had deleted or altered data in its phone records.
When he asked whether it was the best way to ascertain such details, the witness answer was in the affirmative.
Mr. Indatissa was also of the view that PTL CEO Kasuna Palisena had only looked at the system on August 18 and had prepared his affidavit, saying that PTL did not have a recording system which stored caller details.
Adding some amusement to the questioning, Mr. Indatissa said Metropolitan owner Ambani did not know about the Metropolitan systems and in a similar fashion his client, PTL CEO was also unaware about the matter not being a technical expert.
In the earlier affidavit which was submitted by the PTL CEO it was said that PTL had a recording system which only records the voice recordings with serial numbers.
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena later questioned the witness about the Indian mother companys report.
Justice Jayawardena: Did your Indian company examine the system after you made a request
Witness: Yes
J: And their report says they cannot recover any data pertaining to the time period between February 2015- May 2016, right, and that there had been a re-installation and re-configuration in July, right
W: Yes
J: Can a remote method of examination find that sort of information
W: Yes
Meanwhile, it was revealed that PTL had now given its previous hard disk drive, the new computer, and the four CDs containing back-up data pertaining to the time period after July 6, 2017 to the CID officials who are attached to the PCoI.
Acceding to Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagodas request, the Commission yesterday also allowed the CID to examine all the devices handed over by PTL with assistance of Metropolitan officers.
ASG Yasantha Kodagoda was of the view that since the previous computer was said to have crashed, they had to examine the reasons as to why it had crashed. At this moment Justice Prasanna Jayawardena in a lighter vein quipped in pithy Sinhala: Hena Wedunada Balanna (See whether it was struck by lightning) amid ripples of laughter in the courtroom.
During the cross examination, there was a heated argument between ASG Dappula De Livera and PC Kalinga Indatissa.
Counsel Indatissa questioned the witness about the affidavit and the one who attested it and the witness was unaware about the name of the counsel who had attested the Affidavit.
The witness however, said he had signed the affidavit in the presence of that counsel but did not know his name. ASG Livera was unhappy about the line of questioning and objected to the questioning in an aggressive manner.
The ASG asked whether that line of questioning implied suspicion towards the officers of AGs Department. Counsel Indatissa PC too responded in a higher tone of voice saying he did not mention about the AGs Department. This led to a heated argument between the two senior Presidents Counsel that went on for sometime. However, Justice Prasanna Jayawardena intervened and directed both parties to stop the argument.

RCGC  sees no birdie as Kelani Valley railway plans  to go double
	
The Royal Colombo Golf Course (RCGC) spans across acres of greenery and adds picturesque views to its setting. Running through this course is the Kelani Valley railway track from Maharagama to Kosgama. Recently, measures were taken to install a second railway track across the Colombo Golf Course and the project is at present in its planning stage. The  learned that the project has been undertaken by the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation in collaboration with the Department of Railways. 
History of RCGC
The RCGC dates back to the establishing of golf in Sri Lanka and also highlights a century of sporting traditions, customs, manners and styles during British Ceylon. Back in 1879, the British decided to introduce golf to the Ceylonese. The British being organized in any discipline they undertook, the sport of golf inevitably spread throughout Ceylon. Sports such as horse racing, polo, cricket, football, hockey and rugby union were introduced at the Galle Face Green. Sharing the premises with cricket and rugby fans, the Royal Golf Club was established. Yet with an expanding membership and the Galle Face Green becoming more and more crowded, it became less suitable for golf.
The RCGC will have to come up with their plan especially in terms of ensuring the safety of the golfers because now they will have to cross not one but two tracks
Later on, Sir Charles Henry de Soysa, a Ceylonese philanthropist, set up a farm named Alfred Model Farm in pursuit of creating a centre for excellence in agriculture and animal husbandry, which, however, never prospered. Around the same time, Sir West Ridgeway arrived in Colombo as the new British Governor of Ceylon. Being a golf enthusiast himself, the golfing communitys requests for a separate ground fell on sympathetic ears. In July 1896 the Alfred Model Farm was then officially converted to the Colombo Golf Club.
In 1928, His Majesty King George V, bestowed upon the Club the privilege of using the prefix Royal, and consequently the Colombo Golf Club came to be known as the Royal Colombo Golf Club.
Recently, measures were taken to install a second railway track across the Colombo Golf Course
	The project has been undertaken by the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation in collaboration with the Department of Railways
	The Kelani Valley railway line is a single track all the way and it is one of the corridors that needs access
	to a railway
ADB is conductinga feasibility study
- Transport Ministry Secretary
Transport Ministry secretary Nihal Somaweera said that this isnt a new railway track, but doubling of the existing track. The Asia Development Bank (ADB) is currently doing a feasibility study since it is funding the project. After the designing stage is completed it will be implemented. We are trying to make it an elevated track, but it would cost a lot of money,Somaweera said.
New track expected to go a little above ground
-RCGC General Manager
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, RCGC General Manager, Wing Commander (SLAF Retd.), Nalin Jayatilleke said that the contract has been offered to a foreign entity. Just a few months ago, a survey was done. So far its at the planning stage and as far as I know this track is expected to go a little above ground. We are closely following it up with the engineers attached to the Railway Department and the Transport Ministry. However a plan hasnt been sketched yet since its done by a foreign consultancy, Fernando said.
Double-tracking is the only solution for the traffic congestion
- Prof. Amal Kumarage
Senior Professor Amal Kumarage at the Department of Transport and Logistics Management of the University of Moratuwa said that double-tracking is the only solution for the traffic congestion in Colombo. The Kelani Valley railway line is a single track all the way and it is one of the corridors that needs access to a railway. So far only the coastal and the main railway tracks have double tracks. The Negombo-Puttalam railway line has double tracks up to a certain point. People complain about the traffic. By introducing double railway tracks this problem could be solved, explained Kumarage.
The RCGC will have to come up with a safety plan first
-Priyath Fernando
Voicing his concerns about this project, Sri Lanka Golf Union President Priyath Fernando said that the double-tracking project would certainly affect the golf course. The RCGC will have to come up with their plan especially in terms of ensuring the safety of the golfers because now they will have to cross not one but two tracks,Fernando cautioned.

SUROL - Society for Upliftment and Rehabilitation of Leprosy -Affected  Persons
	
SUROL, established and registered in 1971, is the only organization that looks after the welfare of disabled Leprosy-affected persons in Sri Lanka, irrespective of their ethnicity or religious beliefs. This organization is led by a group of volunteers who function as the Board of Management, which is committed to continue this work of charity towards the less fortunate in our society. 
In the wider context of Sri Lanka, there are some 2,000 new cases being identified and treated per year; of these about 75% get cured. A great many of them are being cared for by the Government in a very limited way. The authorities are now of the opinion that the disease is at a manageable level and have arranged for treatment at all Base Hospitals throughout the island. All the patients now live with their families and attend Clinics in their own areas. So are the patients who have not been cured and end up with deformities. 
Here is a brief note of the work we do for those disabled persons affected by Leprosy and being looked after by SUROL. 
It looks after 274 Disabled Leprosy-Affected persons and 62 School-going Children of these families. We are targeting to reach out to 350 Adults and 100 Children of patients going to school, if possible this year. 
	At the moment we have been able to get sponsorships for about 80% of Adult patients and 62 children. The unsponsored Adults are supported through general donations, which is fast diminishing. 
	We have a Staff of eight along with six Sisters as Field Volunteer Coordinators. These Sisters are in Convents around the places where some of the patients live. They visit these families from time to time. 
	As you can understand, most patients do not live in places where public transport is readily available and very often the roads are not motorable, Officers from Surol visit them twice a year for Christmas and the Sinhala/Tamil new Year, where we give each Patient a Hamper costing around Rs.7,000. 
Besides the above, there are other needs we look into among them.
Sponsorship of a disabled person -- Rs.2,500 or Education of a Child of the family -- Rs.2,000 a month. 
	Building a House costing Rs.700,000 or Repairs to Houses or Roofs, etc ranging from Rs.25,000 to Rs.100,000 a family. 
	Building of a Toilet -- Rs.60,000 to Rs.75,000 a family.

Tender for fourth LNG power plant to open next week: PM
	
The government will next week call for tenders seeking a suitable investor for the fourth Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) power plant, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.
The Prime Minister made this statement at the FACETS Sri Lanka 2017 gem and jewellery exhibition in Colombo.
Sri Lanka is now holding discussions with India and Japan to construct two LNG power plants and also discussing with China to have one LNG power station in Hambantota. When did Sri Lanka go into constructing three LNG power stations parallelly. The government will also open tenders to select a suitable investor for the fourth LNG power plant. Sri Lanka will be able to start constructing four such power plants together if the tender procedure becomes a success, the premier said.
Sri Lanka cannot remain a low income or a middle income nation. It is a shame to be on the same income level every day. Sri Lanka will have to become a high income generating country. The two main parties came together to build a strong economy. We have to lay the foundation to build such a strong economy and see that it is achieved, he added.
The Premier said the government wasable to release itself from the debt it fell into as a result of the Hambantota Port project.
We will do the same with Mattala Airport. Debts have to be paid during our life time.We took over an economy which was hampered by borrowings and an economy which did not have foreign investments. I have been told that foreign investments have grown by 300 per cent today compared to 2014. Investments are coming from China, Japan and India, he also said.

Thousands more Rohingya flee to border as Myanmar violence flares
	

REUTERS, 30th AUGUST, 2017- Nearly 9,000 Rohingya Muslims, many sick and fearing for their lives, have fled the worst violence to grip northwest Myanmar in at least five years, while thousands more are stuck at the Bangladesh border or preparing to reach it in coming days.
A series of coordinated attacks by Rohingya insurgents on security forces in the north of Myanmars Rakhine state on Friday and ensuing clashes triggered the Rohingya exodus, while the government evacuated thousands of Rakhine Buddhists.
The United Nations, while condemning the attacks, pressured Myanmar to protect civilian lives without discrimination and appealed to Bangladesh to let those fleeing the military counteroffensive through.

War crimes: Why not against Sarath Fonseka: SLPP
	
In the wake of lawsuits filed against ex-army commander and Sri Lanka's former ambassador to Brazil, Jagath Jayasuriya, the Ex-servicemen's Association affiliated to the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna today asked why similar charges had not been filed against ex-army commander and MP, Sarath Fonseka.
Its convener Ajith Prasanna said Mr. Jayasuriya served under Mr. Fonseka who was the then army commander and asked whether it was because Mr. Fonseka had become a stooge of this US-sponsored government that he had been exempted of such charges.
These allegations levelled against Jagath Jayasuriya is a serious blow to the Sri Lanka Army. We condemn these allegations by the Tamil diaspora, Mr. Prasanna said and pointed out that proper procedures had not been followed when appointing Maj. Gen. Mahesh Senanayake as Army Commander and Rear Admiral Travis Sinniah as Navy Commander.(Sheain Fernandopulle)

Wijeyadasa left because he violated collective responsibility: Thalatha
	
Justice and Foreign Employment Minister Talatha Atukorale today said that former minister Wijeydasa Rajapakshe had to leave because he violated collective responsibility of the cabinet and does not know whether he exerted any influence on the Attorney General's Department to delay filing charges against anyone as suggested by certain politicians, civil society and individuals.
Minister Rajapakshe was removed from the cabinet for violating the collective responsibility of the cabinet and not for any other offence, she said.
However, I expect to study the charge of such legal delays and take swift action against corrupt politicians and officials and take action to rectify it if they were true.
Minister Atukorale assumed duties as the new Minister of Justice last morning at her office at Hulftsdorp following the expulsion of former Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe from the cabinet on charges of breaching collective responsibility of the cabinet.
Speaking to the media, Minister Atukorale said the entire judiciary and AGs department were under the thumb of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa during his rule but no one talked about it. With the newly found freedom under this government people have resorted to protest even for banning the use of polythene.
She also said that the joint opposition had lodged complains with the bribery commission against UNP ministers Malik Smarawickrama, Kabir Hashim, Ravi Karunanayake, Dr. Rajitha Senaratne and her under their top 10 propaganda but the Yahapalana government is determined not to let real criminals to grab power in future
Minister Atukorale vowed that she would do anything and everything to safeguard the independence of the judiciary and Attorney Generals Department. She thanked President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for having trust in her and appointing her as the Minister of Justice.(Sandun Jayasekara)

Yala National Park closed for two months from Friday
	
The Yala National Park would be closed for two months from Friday (Sept.1) as a result of the extremely low rainfall in the area and due to the prevailing drought, Wildlife Conservation Department spokesperson Hasini Sarathchandra said.
The park will re-open again on October 31, provided rains being experienced during this time. However, it should be noted that last year too the park reopening following the dry season had to be extended as the drought had continued to effect the availability of water for the animals to survive, Sarathchandra said.
Accordingly, the Palatupana Entrance Block 1 and 2 of the Yala National Park would be closed while Galge and Yala West Entrances Block 3, 2, 5 would remain open for visitors, she said.
The time the park closes to the public happens to be the breeding season for leopards. So it helps not just these majestic animals but allows greater time and space for park officials to focus on the animals, she said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
