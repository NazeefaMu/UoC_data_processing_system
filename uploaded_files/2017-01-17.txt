Air Force officer arrested at BIA
	
A SLAF Flight Lieutenant was today arrested by Customs officers at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA), when attempting to smuggle eight bottles of foreign liquor into the country, Airport Customs Deputy Director Parakrama Basnayake said.
He said the arrest was made at the airport tarmac when the Flt. Lieut. was on the verge of removing the bottles bypassing the Customs.
Mr. Basnayake alleged that the Flt Lieut. had smuggled 40 bottles of foreign liquor on five earlier occasions. Investigations had revealed that these bottles had been given to him by Indian passengers to be taken out of the airport. The suspect was handed over to the Air Force Police for further investigations.
Meanwhile, Air Force Spokesman Gihan Seneviratne said the Air Force was unable to make any comments on the incident on the basis that investigations were continuing. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Canada upholds deportation of LTTE fundraiser
	
An alleged fundraiser for Tamil rebels who has been fighting deportation from Canada for more than two decades has lost a key court battle after a federal judge dismissed his appeal.
The Federal Court upheld the deportation of Manickavasagam Suresh on the grounds he was a member of a terrorist organization and that he was complicit in war crimes and crimes against humanity.
The evidence ?adequately supported? the Immigration and Refugee Board?s finding that Suresh was a member of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, or LTTE, Justice Richard Mosley wrote in his ruling.
The judge also found reasonable the IRB?s finding that Suresh was ?a dedicated supporter who voluntarily worked on behalf of the LTTE and willingly followed the direction of the organization?s leadership.?
The Tigers were separatist guerrillas who fought for independence for Sri Lanka?s ethnic Tamil minority. In addition to fighting a ground war, they conducted numerous political assassinations and bombings.
In 1990, Suresh was allegedly sent to Toronto by the LTTE to help run the group?s front organization, the World Tamil Movement, serving as its co-ordinator. But he was arrested in 1995 as a security risk.
Initially, Canadian authorities tried to deport him under a security certificate, which was upheld by the Federal Court. He fought the case to the Supreme Court, which ruled he could face torture if returned to his home country.
But the government continued to quietly push for his removal and in 2008, immigration officials drafted a report alleging he was inadmissible to Canada due to his membership in the WTM and his complicity in war crimes.
Following a hearing, the IRB ordered his deportation in 2015. The 40-page decision dismissing his appeal of that ruling was handed down on Jan. 10 but as of Monday had not yet been posted on the Federal Court website.
The Tamil Tigers ran a lucrative fundraising operation in Toronto and Montreal until the WTM?s offices were raided by the RCMP in 2006. Among other things, the searches turned up appeals for money to buy weapons.
The WTM was placed on Canada?s list of outlawed terrorist groups in 2008. In 2009, the Tamil rebels were defeated by Sri Lankan government forces, which have themselves been accused of committing war crimes during the lengthy conflict.(The Canadian National Post)

Ceylinco Life marks 29 years with foundation stone for Kadawatha green branch
	
?
Life insurance leader Ceylinco Life celebrated its 29th anniversary on January 14 by laying the foundation stone for a new eco-friendly branch building on company-owned land in Kadawatha.
Located at 15A Jaya Mawatha, Kadawatha, the new branch building will on completion have two-floors offering 5,870 square feet of space, with provision to expand upwards to four storeys, the company said.
The new building is designed for optimal use of natural light and will be entirely solar powered. It will also be equipped with the latest energy-efficient lighting and air conditioning systems and will have a facility for rainwater harvesting and its own car park with space for 10 vehicles at a time.
The foundation stone for the new building was laid by Ceylinco Life Managing Director/CEO R. Renganathan accompanied by several fellow directors and senior management.
Ceylinco Life recently opened similarly designed eco-friendly branch buildings in Horana and Panadura as part of the company?s steadily-progressing plan to convert as many branches as possible to sustainable energy.
Among the other Ceylinco Life?s branch buildings designed to the new environment-friendly model are those in Wennappuwa and Bandarawela. The company also owns the buildings housing its offices in Anuradhapura, Trincomalee, Jaffna, Batticaloa, Kandy, Kalutara, Kurunegala, Gampaha, Galle, Matara, Tissamaharama, Negombo, Ratnapura, Kotahena and Mount Lavinia and many of them have already been converted to solar energy.
Ceylinco Life?s head office building at Havelock Road, Colombo 5 has also broken new ground in the sphere of eco-friendly operations with the installation of the biggest solar electricity system in the city of Colombo to date, with an investment of Rs.13.7 million to generate 63.18kW.
The company operates the largest network of 250 branches in Sri Lanka?s life insurance industry, giving it a physical presence in 142 cities, towns and villages in every one of the island?s 25 districts.
The market leader in Sri Lanka?s life insurance sector since 2004, Ceylinco Life has close to a million lives covered by active policies.?
The company is acknowledged as the benchmark for innovation in the local insurance industry for its work in product research and development, customer service, professional development and corporate social responsibility.

Controversial FB page takes down Pix of underage girls
	
The controversial Facebook page which had published pictures of young girls and lured viewers who were sexually attracted by them, had taken down its photos by yesterday evening, the Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) said.
CERT Information Security Engineer Roshan Chandragupta said they had received emails complaining about the page and requesting action.
?We have informed the Facebook administration about the page. The issue is people can publish photos and maintain such a page within the freedom given by Facebook. Different people have different mentalities. It's up to the users to use the privacy setting option so that strangers can't steal their photos and other information,? he told Daily Mirror.
He said there were many pages similar to the controversial page, and people could request the Facebook administration to take such photos, profiles and pages down.
Mr. Chandragupta said they had also received complaints about fake profiles made with stolen photos of people. ?The best thing to do is to set the Facebook privacy setting option to the ?Only friends? mode, instead of public,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

GSP+: We rejected certain EU requests: Lakshman Yapa
	
The European Union (EU) had made certain requests to be met, which Sri Lanka could not agree under any circumstances-such as the enactment of right to engage in acts of homosexuality- when it considered the Sri Lanka?s application for GSP Plus, State Minister of Finance Lakshman Yapa Abeywardane said today.
He said the Sri Lankan government would meet the requests made by the EU in accordance with the law of the land and the Constitution and the EU must wait till Sri Lanka obtained Cabinet Approval and Parliament approval before proceeding with any action.
He told a news conference that it was unfair to make this kind of requests that directly affected the religious, social and cultural and sentiments of the people.
He said that Sri Lanka would implement only the requests she could carry out without harming the interests of any community.
?Some proposals made by the EU have not been met even in certain European countries. Therefore, it is extremely difficult for Sri Lanka to go ahead with them. That is why, the Cabinet decided to totally remove certain clauses in the proposals,? he added.
Minister Abeywardane said the EU had not made any demands or conditions as a prerequisite to renew GSP Plus as certain anti-national, anti-government elements and the Joint Opposition tried to make out, but only a few requests, which the Government rejected. (Sandun A. Jayasekera)

## Title: Hambantota Port sale in perspective
## Section: News Features

Hambantota Port sale in perspective
	
Despite the departure of the Rajapaksas, the hinterland of Hambantota is very much in the news. The privatization attempt of Hambantota Port by the government has drawn much controversy. Though the government intentionally refrains from using the terms ?privatization? and ?sale? when it talks about the subject, instead brands it a ?debt-to-equity swap?, the public backlash has delayed the signing of the sale agreement with the relevant Chinese party. ??
?
Vital statistics
Before deeming the good, the bad and the ugly side of the port deal, it is important to put the rhetoric aside and use some vital statistics to put things into perspective. ??
According to the Finance Ministry data, Hambantota Port project has a total loan of US $ 1.35 billion. Out of that, US $ 900 million was drawn at a 2% interest rate and the remainder is with an interest rate ranging from 6.3% to 7.65%. ??
According to Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), provisional data secured by Daily Mirror, the Hambantota Port (phase I) in 2016 made a revenue of US $ 11.81 million and incurred expenses of US $ 10 million as direct and administrative costs to report an operating profit of US $ 1.81 million. ??
Assuming the Hambantota Port would record a 20% growth in operating profits next year, which according to shipping experts is still a very optimistic scenario, it would record an operating profit of US $ 2.2 billion in 2017. In contrast, the loan payment for the year, according to the above statistics, would amount to almost US $ 79 million, creating a deficit of US $ 76.8 million, which the government would have to use the tax payers? money to settle. ??
Let?s assume the port would be able to maintain a 20% profit growth for 15 years at a stretch, it would be making an operating profit of US $ 33.5 million in 2032 and the loan repayment amount would stand at US $ 68 million, yet short of almost US $ 35 million to stand on its own. ??
In the meantime, we shouldn?t forget that the port needs investment, at least running into a good half-a-billion dollars to forge ahead to establish itself as a major port and a trans-shipment hub in the Asian region, leveraging its strategic location. ??
Hence, looking at the above assumptions, some drastic measures are required for the port to keep functioning before it becomes a massive burden to the national budget. ??
Chinese deal
The first announcement from the government with regard to the Hambantota Port was about a debt-to-equity swap. But later it was revealed that a joint venture (JV) company would be formed between the SLPA and China Merchant Port Holdings Company Limited (CMPHC) incorporating the port and its premises, and thus, 80% of it would be owned by CMPHC and the rest by the SLPA. CMPCH would pay US $ 1.12 billion for its 80% holding, which would be subjected to a lease period of 99 years. The deal includes the 1,235 acres of land that belongs to the Hambantota port. We hope somebody has done a proper valuation to arrive at these figures. ??
According to the information available in the public domain, the Hambantota port development project is a government-to-government deal between the Sri Lanka and China. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) is believed to have been signed between the two governments and based on that, two bids from CMPCH and China Harbour Engineering Company Limited (CHEC) were entertained by the Sri Lankan government. However, the CMPCH?s bid was chosen over the latter?s. ??
CMPCH is the company that operates the Colombo International Container Terminal (CICT) while the CHEC handles the Colombo Port City project. ??
Fundamental flaws
Against this backdrop, we can identify that several major flaws in the way in which the potential monetization of the Hambantota Port was handled by the government. ??
The biggest flaw was the absence of calling of international bids for the port development project on a competitive basis. Yes, the port was funded and built by the Chinese. But does it need to be managed by the Chinese too? This is not to belittle the Chinese assistance generously extended to Sri Lanka, especially in the post-war period. But if the government had gone for a round of international bidding, wouldn?t there have been a much sweeter deal? Even the two Chinese companies would have offered better deals! ??
There are enough and many examples where international port and terminal operators have made bids for Asian ports depending on their strategic positioning and importance to international trade. Needless to say that, location-wise, the Hambanota Port is in a highly strategic position as far as international maritime trade is concerned. ??
If that was the case, the public opinion over the privatization of the Hambantota Port would have also been different. If the terms and conditions were properly laid out in a transparent manner, there would have been lesser chance that the educated public would make a fuss over it. ??
Geo-politics in front seat?
By making it a government-to-government project, a question arises as to whether the deal is purely commercial in nature or has to do more with geo-politics. ?It is no secret that the initial arrogant approach of the coalition government with regards to the Chinese involvement in Sri Lanka had ruffled some feathers. China, which was the biggest source of finance for Sri Lanka in the post-war era, was overlooked by the Western-oriented coalition government, naively thinking that the funds from the Western world, which was sidelined during the Rajapaksa administration would, flow in. Since no funds came in, the government returned to China, which was waiting patiently, with a begging bowl. By that time the government had antagonized the Chinese enough by halting the Port City project, which was initiated by the Chinese President Xi Jinping in Colombo. So ?the ?proposed awarding of the Hambantota Port to a Chinese company is an overcompensation to China to offset the consequences of disastrous foreign policy initially adopted by the coalition government? ??
Another case of the economics taking the rear seat and geo-politics taking the front is the proposed construction of the East Container Terminal of the Colombo harbour. Though international bids were called from interested parties, the creeping in of geo-politics into the deal at a later stage has stalled the whole selection process. ??
Policy backed by research
It was only last week, economic advisor to the President and trade policy expert Dr.Sarath Rajapathirana told a forum in Colombo that political decision-making on economic matters should be backed by proper research. He said government policies, especially ones to do with the economy, should be backed by research and highlighted the disconnect between the policy makers and the researchers in the country. ??
In other words, when there is no policy informed by research, economics goes to the rear seat and geo-politics and other vested interests occupy the front. This is not to naively say that politics and economics could be separated. But it shouldn?t be too much of an ask when a decision relating to the country?s economy is taken, ?economics should always be at the forefront. ?

Kushan D? Alwis PC: Efforts underway to weaken unitary character
	
President?s Counsel Kushan D? Alwis, who served the Public Representation Committee that deliberated with people on Constitution making, says there is lack of transparency in the whole Constitution making process. In an interview with Daily Mirror, he says strong unitary features are needed in the Constitution. Excerpts;?
?
As a President?s Counsel who served the Public Representation Committee, how do you see the Constitution-making process??
What I witness at the moment is lack of transparency. Why I say so is because we, the Public Representation Committee, gave certain recommendations regarding the presidential system, the electoral system and so forth. Unfortunately, the sub-committee reports do not touch on either. These two are very crucial in my mind to any Constitution-making process. What is the future of the presidential system? The sub-committee report does not touch on it. Next, the electoral system is also not looked at. It is a part of the present Constitution. These two are vital elements to be considered, and according to my understanding, there is lack of transparency. In the Public Representation Committee report, as you see, there are recommendations which are quite contrary to each other on each subject. If you go through it, you would find the proposals contradicting each other on matters like the national flag, religion and power devolution. There is no need for anyone to pen a second report. You would, sometimes, find five different recommendations on a single subject matter. One cannot settle on any conclusion by going through the Public Representation Committee report as to what the Constitution would look like in the end.?
How important is it to have the current presidential system??
It is like this. The presidential system, coupled with the provincial council system and devolution of powers, plays a vital role. That is for the reason that it is the President, through the governors appointed by him, who controls the activities of provincial councils. The parliament has nothing to do here.
?It looks like the government is attempting to give more powers to the periphery.?
Then, if one is to knock off the presidential system, there will have to be alternative safeguards for it. Otherwise, there can be absolute chaos.?
There is an argument that power devolution is needed to guarantee the rights of minorities. What are your thoughts??
I do not agree with it. I say the 13th Amendment is the unwanted child fathered forcibly by India on Mother Lanka. Moreover, we all know how the 13th Amendment was passed in Parliament, how the MPs were brought in to Parliament and how they voted. It is something which the country was basically forced to swallow. There was no demand from the country, barring the North and East, for devolution of power. Therefore, I feel that the solution to this issue is not devolution of power in the manner now being tried upon. It could be worked out more administratively. Of course, every Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim has a right to every inch of the country. Be it in Jaffna or Matara, everyone has a right. There must be absolute freedom for every citizen to be able to transact his or her day-to-day work in their mother tongue. I am talking particularly about the Sinhala and Tamil languages. I would say a Tamil must be able to transact his or her business in Tamil in Matara. We must bring it up to that level. Also, if there are issues about university admission and similar concerns, all have to be looked into. But, in this small nation, I do not believe that the creation of a Federal state or something akin would be the best answer. It can have very dangerous consequences.?
There is criticism that the govt. will bring in a Constitution which is unitary in name but Federal in content. How do you see it?
Yes. One can see from the reports of the sub-committees that there is a move to weaken the power of the centre and strengthen the provincial councils along with land and police powers. Then, although it is unitary in name, it will amount to be a de facto Federal state.?
In the Supreme Court ruling on the 13th Amendment at that time, four judges of the bench argued that Sri Lanka was a Federal state. How do you comment??
In that dissenting judgment, the thing is that, as it stood at that moment, there were police and land powers outlined in the Bill presented. However, even during the times of the then President the late J.R. Jayewardene, the late R. Premadasa and former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, land and police powers were not given. Therefore, there would have been some good reasons for it. Ms. Kumaratunga, during her 11 years, even did not take any step in this regard. The 13th Amendment was already in place. There is no need for two-thirds in Parliament to do it. When those four judges looked at it in this manner, it sounded almost a de facto Federal state. The central government, having realised the dangers involved and due to certain judgments, did not give land and police powers. Now, there are attempts to weaken the centre as shown in the proposals for new Constitution-making.?
?
"At least now we must put in some effort to stop further damage being done. There are a lot of players involved here. Now, there is the so-called international community. All of them push for more devolution of power. If we can stop it at least, that will be a great achievement. Certainly, it will be a bonus if we can strengthen the Constitution.?At the moment, I do not think?that can be achieved"
?
How dangerous is it for a country like Sri ?Lanka to devolve power?
I consider it to be very serious. I say it with reasons. One is the fact that none of the present Northern political leaders has ?condemned Prabhakaran. They have not said Prabhakaran did not represent the views of Tamil people. If they say so, they would ?lose their political bases in those areas. In turn, it means the population believes in it; a worst scenario. In that mindset, one has to take into consideration the fact that there are 77 million people in Tamil Nadu which is in close proximity to Sri Lanka. As long as there is a strong central government in India, the Eelam dream will be unrealistic there. However, maybe 75 or 100 years later, if there is any weakening of the central government of India, disintegration will be inevitable. The Eelam concept will definitely come into play. If there is a de facto Federal state, it will fall short of only one step behind a separate state. One has to think far. As long as India is united with a strong central government, it will be impossible in that country.?
What do you propose to do in terms of constitutional arrangements to prevent Sri Lanka from being partitioned in future??
What I feel is that there must be economic development of the country right across. If there is development in the North and East and rest of the country, higher education standards and facilities, then the clamour for Eelam will diminish. Constitutionally, one has to ensure that every citizen has equal rights everywhere in the country. I am totally against devolution of power based on ethnicities, and I have specifically mentioned that in this report.?
Then, how do you see the need to strengthen the unitary character of the Constitution?
It would be ideal to strengthen it further. At least now we must put in some effort to stop further damage being done. There are a lot of players involved here. Now, there is the so-called international community. All of them push for more devolution of power. If we can stop it at least, that will be a great achievement. Certainly, it will be a bonus if we can strengthen the Constitution. At the moment, I do not think that can be achieved.?
There is an argument that the minorities have been denied the right of decision-making due to lack of power devolved. How do you respond??
Of course, they can be brought into decision-making processes by assigning Cabinet responsibilities to their representatives. One can look into various systems within the framework of the central government. It is possible under the unitary character. Today, the Muslim and upcountry Tamils are represented in the Cabinet. The Northern Tamil political leaders have decided to stay away from Cabinet responsibilities.?
How do you see the foremost status accorded to Buddhism?
When looking at the sub-committee reports, I do not think the government will touch on this point. But, what is proposed is to weaken this particular clause on Buddhism in another way by expanding the scope of fundamental rights. Under fundamental rights on religion, the right to propagate has been given. One should have the liberty to preach religion. That is one. Propagation is another.?
According to the sub-committee report on Fundamental Rights, the freedom to manifest religion is there. You could manifest the religion of person in worship, observance and practice. These are not issues. The issue is propagation. Even teaching religion is not an issue. Propagation can lead to a lot of abuse because it can be done in many ways. Then, there is a watchdog to look after all these aspects.?
It is practically impossible. It will create dissension among the religions. Some religious sects with fundamentalist agendas and backed by some foreign countries can create issues in the guise of propagation. I strongly feel that the word ?propagation? should not be included.?
Now, in the Steering Committee, the focus is on revisiting the APRC proposals for Constitution-making in the past. There is reference to the 2,000 proposals by former President Chandrika Bandaranaike. How do you look at them??
The 2000 Bill, for instance, sought to take off the unitary status. I do not think it should be touched. That too, I believe, will not be touched in words. But, by the subsequent devolution of power, the entire meaning of the word ?unitary? will be brought to nil.?
In my view, the government will try to work out the new Constitution. Whatever it is, it should be presented to the approval of the people by referendum. The Supreme Court has to decide whether it should be a referendum or not.?
While some articles or clauses may need two-thirds approval as well as a referendum, some others may not. It is ultimately the Supreme Court that will have make the call.?

Last man to walk on Moon, dies aged 82
	
US astronaut Gene Cernan - the last man to walk on the Moon - has died aged 82. America's space agency Nasa said it was "saddened by the loss" of the retired spaceman.
Captain Cernan was one of only three people to go to the Moon twice and the last man to leave a footprint on the lunar surface in 1972.
The final words he spoke there were: "We leave as we came and, God willing, as we shall return with peace and hope for all mankind."
He was the commander of the Apollo 17 mission at the time.
Twelve people have walked on the Moon, and only six of them are still alive today.
In a statement, Cernan's family said he passed away on Monday following ongoing health issues. They did not give any further details.
"It is with very deep sadness that we share the loss of our beloved husband and father," the statement said.
"Our family is heartbroken.
"Even at the age of 82, Gene was passionate about sharing his desire to see the continued human exploration of space and encouraged our nation's leaders and young people to not let him remain the last man to walk on the Moon."
Before the Apollo 17 mission, Cernan had travelled into space twice - in 1966 and 1969.
A qualified naval aviator, he was selected into the third group of Nasa astronauts in 1963.
He retired in 1976, going into private business and contributing to US television channels on a variety of issues.
Cernan also produced a documentary film about his life, which he discussed at length in this BBC interview in 2014.
Born on 14 March 1934 in Chicago, his full name was Eugene Andrew Cernan.
He is survived by his wife Jan Nanna Cernan, his daughter and two step-daughters and also nine grandchildren.
His family said details regarding his funeral would be announced in the coming days.
Gene Cernan's death comes just weeks after that of another Nasa astronaut, John Glenn. (BBC)

MH370 underwater search for missing plane suspended
	
The underwater search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has been suspended nearly three years after it vanished without a trace over the Indian Ocean, according to a joint statement from Chinese, Australian and Malaysian officials.
The three countries had been leading the search for MH370, which disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014, with 239 people on board.
"Despite every effort using the best science available, cutting edge technology, as well as modeling and advice from highly skilled professionals who are the best in their field, unfortunately, the search has not been able to locate the aircraft," the statement said.
"The decision to suspend the underwater search has not been taken lightly nor without sadness."
Voice370, a support group for family members of those aboard the flight, released a statement expressing their disappointment.
"Commercial planes cannot just be allowed to disappear without a trace," the statement said.
"Stopping at this stage is nothing short of irresponsible, and betrays a shocking lack of faith in the data, tools and recommendations of an array of official experts assembled by the authorities themselves."
Steve Wang, whose mother was on board the flight, told CNN he was disappointed the search had ended with few, if any, answers.
"They said they are quite sure that they are searching the right place, but it seems that they are wrong." he said.
"I think it is their responsibility, not only for the 239 passengers on the plane, or for the next-of-kin like us, but also they have to give an answer to the whole world ... what really happened to MH370."
The plane's disappearance remains one of the greatest aviation mysteries in modern history.
Searchers spent millions of dollars scouring tens of thousands of square miles, but so far have yielded little new information about the plane's final moments.
In July last year, Australia, China and Malaysia agreed that if the aircraft was not located by the time 120,000 square kilometers (46,000 square miles) had been covered, the search would be suspended.
"The decision came not lightly," Australia's Transport Minister, Darren Chester, said at the time.
"But in the absence of new credible evidence it is not possible to continue searching. Every effort has been made. We have used the most high tech and the best people for this search."

NATO is ?obsolete?, Germany?s Angela Merkel made a ?catastrophic mistake? on refugees, Brexit will be ?great? and the US could cut a deal with Russia: Donald Trump unleashed a volley of broadsides Sunday in interviews with European media. ??
Five days before his inauguration as the 45th President of the United States, he let loose a torrent of controversial comments about European allies in interviews with British newspaper The Times and Germany?s Bild. ??
He extended a hand to Russia, which has been hit by a string of sanctions under his predecessor Barack Obama over Moscow?s involvement in Ukraine, the Syrian war and for alleged cyber attacks to influence the US election. ??
??Let?s see if we can make some good deals with Russia,? Trump said in remarks carried by The Times. ??
The US president-elect suggested a deal in which nuclear arsenals would be reduced and sanctions against Moscow would be eased, but gave no details. ??
??Russia?s hurting very badly right now because of sanctions, but I think something can happen that a lot of people are gonna benefit,? said the president-elect, who has previously expressed admiration for Russian leader Vladimir Putin. ?

Omanthai army camp, checkpoint removed: Vavuniya GA
	
Vavuniya Government Agent M.B.R. Pushpakumara said today the Omanthai Army Camp and Checkpoint on the A-9 Road had been dismatled after 25 years and the land occupied by the Army was officially handed over him to be given to its original owners.
He told a news conference in Vavuniya that the camp was set up in 1992 for security reasons and the checkpoint began operations on March 22, 2002 and became well known as one of the important nerve centres with vehicles and people passing through having to undergo a stringent check at this point.
Mr. Pushpakumara said 16 of the 19 acres occupied by the army were handed over to him and that the army had informed him that the remaining three acres would also be handed over to him after the army removed their belongings.
He said steps would be taken to hand over the land to its original owners shortly.
When contacted, Military Spokesman Roshan Seneviratne said the Omanthai checkpoint on the A9 Road in Vavuniya would not be completely removed and that the Army would hand over the lands lying on the west.
?The army personnel there will be deployed at the army camp on the other side of the road,? he said. ?It is not a sudden decision to vacate the land. The process of vacating the land had already begun,? Brigadier Seneviratne said.
Earlier it was reported that TNA parliamentarian Sivasakthy Ananthan had said the Army had agreed to release the private land at Rampaikulam at Omanthai where the Omanthai checkpoint was located.
He said the Vavuniya District Agent had agreed to allocate a six-acre block of land to re-locate the camp. (Darshana Sanjeewa and Romesh Madushanka)

ONUR launches Sri Lankan Shared Values Campaign
	
The President?s Office and the Office for National Unity led by Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga (ONUR) has launched a mass communications campaign to raise awareness of ?Sri Lankan Shared Values? as a means of achieving the mindsets needed for national unity and reconciliation. The campaign,timed for National Integration and Reconciliation Week, commenced on Sunday, January 8. ???Following a number of initiatives related to building national unity and reconciliation in the areas of arts and culture, education, conflict transformation, psycho-social support, livelihood development, and assistance to female headed households carried out in various parts of the country by ONUR in addition to its work in policy interventions over the last two years, we are now embarking on reaching out widely to create an appropriate mindset among citizens through this public awareness campaign? stated ONUR Chairperson Ms.Kumaratunga. ?
The campaign is based on the insight that the nation?s long-standing divisive issues which have adversely affected national unity, need to be addressed through offering an alternative proposition that will forge a unified national identity and celebration of the nation?s diversity among all Sri Lankans.?
?
The campaign thus seeks to get people to question for themselves what being a ?True Sri Lankan? really means. As a replacement for the old paradigm of identity defined by labels of ethnicity and religion which has been the entrenched in the psyche of most people, the campaign offers a new identity based on certain common characteristics Sri Lankans possess, which the campaign brings out as ?Sri Lankan Shared Values?. ??
Six?Sri Lankan Shared Values?, such as respect for others of various diversities, compassion and caring towards fellow citizens as taught by all religions, the reinstatement of peace-building and non-violence in a post-war era, social justice for all disadvantaged and marginalized fellow citizens including the willingness to right any wrongs, the adoption of collaboration among diverse people as means of building greater opportunities for all, layered on our famed Sri Lankan hospitality, generosity and friendliness as a people, are highlighted in the campaign for appreciation and adoption as the route to a united, progressive, inclusive and plentiful nation. ?
?
The pro bono campaign, conceptualized by Bates Strategic Alliance, which broke on mainstream and social media has brought on board several civil society opinion leaders and celebrities to speak from their hearts in the campaign?s messaging. Among these are respected elders such as Sarvodaya?s A.T. Ariyaratne and veteran artiste Iranganie Serasinghe, youth activists Thisuri and Senel Wanniarchchi, trail-blazers Sarinda Unamboowa and Nathan Sivagananathan, entertainers Sunil Perera and Marians? Nalin Perera, mountaineer Johann Peries, tourism industry leader Hiran Cooray, cricketers Jehan Mubarak and Muttiah Muralitharan, and renowned artistes Upeka Chitrasena, Taji Dias and Kaushalya Fernando, former minister and diplomat Ms. Ferial Ashroff, film maker Illango Ram, and artistes Mathanavasan and Mahinda Kumar. ?
The campaign is also being supported by journalists and bloggers who are all vital influence-makers in such public awareness efforts and various media institutions. ? ?

PABC introduces smart way to get rid of credit card debt
	
?
Credit cards can be a vital tool in managing one?s personal financials and its popularity has grown tremendously in recent times aided by attractive seasonal promotions offered by most credit card issuers. Unfortunately, this has also results in many individuals spending way above their income levels and then finding themselves struggling to pay off their credit card debts. Since the credit card interest rates generally tend to be higher than that of most types of credit facilities, carrying credit card debt can become a severe burden to the card holder.
As a practical and viable solution to ease the credit card burden, Pan Asia Bank has introduced balance transfer facility along with its range of low interest credit cards.?
This facility allows cardholders to pay off their accumulated credit card debt in full over a specific period of time under a low interest rate.
Pan Asia Bank?s balance transfer facility enables cardholders to transfer their existing credit card balances to a Pan Asia Bank credit card without additional charges and pay it off in instalments. They also have the option to opt for an open-ended balance transfer under a low interest rate without committing for an instalment payment plan. Either way, this facility offers them an opportunity to consolidate their credit card debt under a low interest rate and pay it off according to a plan that fits their cash flows.
Under the balance transfer instalment plans, Pan Asia Bank offers five different instalment options to customers.?
The table illustrates the instalment value for every Rs.100,000 of the transferred balance under each instalment option.
In order to apply for this facility cardholders can simply submit a completed balance transfer application and a Pan Asia Bank credit card application along with required support documentation including the latest statement of his/her existing credit cards.?
Pan Asia Bank currently offers three different credit cards catering to three distinctive segments namely Pan Asia World MasterCard, Pan Asia Black MasterCard and Pan Asia Gold MasterCard. ? ? ??
More information on Pan Asia Bank credit cards and balance transfer facility can be obtained from any of the Pan Asia Bank branches islandwide or by contacting Pan Asia Bank 24 hours call centre.

Proposed Constitution somewhat Similar to APRC Proposals - Says Sumanthiran
	
Tamil National Alliance (TNA) MP for the Jaffna District M.A. Sumanthiran, in an interview with the Daily Mirror, shares his views on the Constitution making and the way forward. He says his party remains optimistic about a positive outcome.?
Excerpts: ?
Q ?How optimistic are you of the Constitution making process?
Well, this is a one?s in life opportunity. It is, in fact, once in the life of a country opportunity. This problem has been with us ever since Independence. Every time, when the party in office makes any effort to resolve it, the party in the Opposition opposed. It happened in 1957, 1965 and went on like that. After many consequences, particularly large scale violence, there was a process from 1994 to 2000 to build a Constitution. But, in August 2000, when a bill was brought to Parliament, the main Opposition opposed. The party came to power within two years of that and took some efforts by signing a Cease Fire Agreement (CFA). Then again, it was moved out of power by the other party. ?
This is the first time ever in the history of this country that the two main parties have come together. The leader of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) is the President, whereas the leader of the United National Party (UNP) is the Prime Minister. They have formed a national government for the very purpose of resolving this issue by bringing a new Constitution acceptable to all the peoples of the country. We supported this effort from the time a common candidate emerged in November, 2014. Though we sit in the Opposition, we and the JVP have been supportive of the National Government?s effort to draft a new Constitution that has the agreement of all the people. We have made significant progress which made me optimistic. One year ago, a resolution was adopted. Then, the Steering Committee was formed. It has met 45 times. Six subcommittees were appointed. They have given their reports. All of the decision made so far in the Constitutional Assembly and the steering committee, have been unanimous decisions. That gave us hope that it was possible to reach the largest consensus in this work of drafting a new constitution. ?
Q ?The SLFP is categorical that it is for a unitary form of governance, and not ready for any compromise on the foremost place accorded to Buddhism. How do you expect power devolution in that context?
The SLFP, or anyone for that matter, can take a position. The UNP election manifesto also speaks of a unitary state.?
That is why we have this process in which we talk together and try to find a solution. Otherwise, different parties have different positions. We are trying to find a common position. With regard to the SLFP position, most of the SLFP Ministers are those who opposed the election of President Maithripala Sirisena. All the senior Ministers- Nimal Siripala de Silva, John Seneviratne, S.B. Dissanayake, Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, Susil Premajayantha- opposed this idea at the very beginning itself. They were defeated along with Mahinda Rajapaksa. They cannot dictate terms as to what this government should do. They joined President Sirisena after he was?
elected President. ??
It only means they accepted the people?s verdict and the mandate given to the President. They cannot put forward their defeated ideology. Then, they should sit in the Opposition. That is a significant mandate given to President Sirisena to abolish the Executive Presidency. In fact, when he announced his candidature, it was the first pledge he gave to the country. He repeatedly said he would not contest again. Now, that was the promise he gave to the people. People have elected him on that promise. It is not for those who opposed him to come and ask not to abolish the Executive Presidency, and to contest again. It does not fall within their purview now to say that. ?
?
	Three levels of power?sharing proposed
	
	
	Only special place, not?foremost place for Buddhism
	
	
	President elected to abolish executive presidency.
	
	
	SLFP Ministers who opposed President at that time should not now dictate terms to him
	
Q ?What is the extent of the amount of power you expect to be devolved in the whole process?
We have discussed this at length in the Steering Committee. What we found was that we did not need to start from scratch because, in the past, there have been many, many processes. There has been substantial consensus on the last of them. That is the APRC process instituted by Mahinda Rajapaksa as the then President. Before that, it was the 2000 bill of former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.?
That had a large consensus around it. The UNP was the only party that opposed it. It opposed because of the transitional provision, not for the content. Mahinda Rajapaksa was a Cabinet Minister then. It was with the Cabinet approval that the bill was brought to Parliament. He did not object to it. All of these Ministers whom I mentioned now were all in the Cabinet at that time, when they brought forward a bill without the word unitary. It did not have the word ?unitary?. So, what we are now trying to do is to look at all these different processes starting from the Mangala Moonasinghe Select Committee, and come up with a document that incorporates all of these. It does not go beyond any of these. There is no room for anyone to object to any provisions. Any of the provision to be contained in the new draft is the provision they have agreed to in the past. ?
Q ?How do you specify the extent of powers to be devolved?
We have the draft bill of former President Kumaratunga, to which all of these people agreed. We are not even going that far. It might be somewhat similar to the APRC report proposals. It recommended the abolition of the concurrent list. There is nothing anyone has ever objected to. The premise is one undivided, indivisible country. It cannot be divided even in the future. That is the matter that all are agreeing. That is a matter we, ourselves, suggested. Now, within that framework, we are trying to see how governance can be taken down to the lowest level. One difference between the other proposals and what we are looking at is that there will be power-sharing at three levels- the central government, provincial levels and local government levels. ??
We have a separate list for local governments as well. What can be done at the local government level should not be taken to the provincial level. There are many things that cannot be done even at the provincial level- national security, foreign affairs and lots of other things. It is a model where people have access to governance in their locality. They do not have to come to Colombo for everything, not even to their provincial capitals. ?
Q ?When you talk about participation of people in governance, there is a school of thought that it can be done by decentralization of power under the centre rather than devolution. What is your view?
There are two levels. What is being given to the local governments is decentralization. The local government bodies do not have law making power. They can only make by-laws. But, to the provinces, it will be devolution of power. The reason is that this is as much as a solution to the national question as it is about taking governance close to people. It is also about people whose number is fewer in the country, who have access to governmental power at least in the areas where they are a majority. For that, it has to be power sharing. ?
Q ?How do you link guaranteeing Fundamental Rights of people with power devolution?
Fundamental Rights can be guaranteed in the Constitution. Even now it is there. The Subcommittee on Fundamental Rights has now extended those rights. That is not the issue. If there is only a central decision making body, the minorities can never make the decisions. ?
As for power sharing with the centre, foreign relations should be vested with the centre. You cannot have nine different foreign relations. It should be one country. The principal of subsidiary will dictate what can be done at the lower level and at the higher level. There should be one standard, for instance, health. It is devolved now. But, there should be uniform standard, for example, issuing licences to doctors. ?
?
?
"It only means they accepted the people?s verdict and the mandate given to the President. They cannot put forward their defeated ideology. Then, they should sit in the Opposition. That is a significant mandate given to President Sirisena to abolish the Executive Presidency. In fact, when he announced his candidature, it was the first pledge he gave to the country..."
?
Q ?What about defence power?
Defence will be entirely in the centre. ?
Q ?What about public finance?
It has to be in the centre. But, there will be certain measures of fiscal independence. Even now certain taxes can be levied by the Provincial Councils. So, not only levying taxes but also receiving grants, negotiating loans for which the centre must grant approval. But, in order to develop their regions, they must have funds. If you talk about financial power, they will be mostly retained in the centre, but, with enough space for the provinces to manage those finances. ?
Q ?Sri Lanka is a country long affected by separatist ideology. In this manner, if more and more independence is accorded to the provinces, there is fear whether it will lead to the partition of the country at one point. How do you respond? ?
Actually, it will be the opposite that will be achieved. The whole separatist movement was there because there was no power sharing. It is a clamour for political power that brought about the separatist movement.?
In the 1972 Constitution-making process, if some of the views of the Tamil parties were accommodated, this would not have happened. When they were excluded from national life, they wanted to be left alone. They said, ?We will go our own way. In 1987, that was redressed somewhat. Tamil was made an official language. The Provincial Councils were created. That was how the 13th Amendment came into being. But, it is not a meaningful structure for devolution of power. There are reasons for that. That was why, even Mahinda Rajapaksa, during his Presidency, and continuously gave assurances that he would fully implement the 13th Amendment. He said he would even go beyond to make devolution meaningful. When he said that, he was admitting that the 13th Amendment was not meaningful. ?
Q ?Though you talk about one country, we hear a lot of voices that speak of separatist trends in the north. What is your position on then?
They come because a lot of our people are cynical and sceptical about this process. They constantly criticize us. They say we are being foolish. Tamil people have been taken for rides continually. The governments which signed pacts tore them up. We have been cheated constantly. There is scepticism. Personally, I feel they are justified in their positions because successive governments have cheated the Tamil people. The only way to address that scepticism is to prove them wrong. ?

Personally, I feel they are justified in their positions because successive governments have cheated the Tamil people. The only way to address that skepticism is to prove them wrong."
?
Q ?How strong is the separatist ideology in the north?
That is not strong at all. There is no separatist ideology at all. It is a sense of despair that nothing is achievable. ?
Q ?There is debate over the current foremost status accorded to Buddhism as the majority religion. What is your view on it?
We are trying to create a modern Constitution that assures equality to all the people. I do not think anyone in this country will dispute that all the people must be equal. You cannot, on the one hand say everyone is equal, and then say Buddhists have foremost place. That is the contradiction. That must be understood by the Buddhists also. At the same time, we recognize that history of Buddhism and the history of this country have a very close relationship.?
There is in fact a special place for Buddhism in this country. We are not grudging that fact. We are willing to accommodate that. Special place to Buddhism is something we will readily agree to. But when you say it is foremost, it says better than the others. That thinking is not consonant with the idea of equality. ?
?
"?Mahinda Rajapaksa was a Cabinet Minister then. It was with the Cabinet approval that the bill was brought to Parliament"
?
Q ?But, even under the present Constitution, Buddhism is given the foremost place. But, Buddhists are not given foremost place. They are considered equal with others. How do you respond?
I grant that. That is why I say a special place to Buddhism must be given. The State must treat all religions equally. Because of the special place, there is duty to be cast upon the State to protect and foster Buddha Sasana. We do not mind it. That can be given so long as whatever place given to Buddhism does not affect the equal rights of other religions. ?
Q ?When you equalise rights, does it mean the right to propagation of religions?
It includes everything. Whatever the Buddhists can do, others must also be able to do. That is equality to people having faiths or without faiths even. On religious ground, there should not be any discrimination. ?
Q ?In your view, what are the rights denied to minorities because there is no power devolution?
That is the right to decision making. The Constitution Assembly of 1972 is a good example of it. When there is a permanent majority and there are permanent minorities, decisions will always favour the majority because they are large in number. It is to balance that inequality, at least in areas where they are the majority, that some power is given. Power means decision making power. ?
?

You cannot, on the one hand say everyone is equal, and then say Buddhists have foremost place. That is the contradiction. That must be understood by the Buddhists also.

Monetary rewards and politics had resulted in the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) earning an illegal profit more than Rs.1.2 billion, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP)said today.
JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said this after last morning's meeting with the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) officials including its President Prof. Carlo Fonseka.
When asked by a journalist about the SLMC's response responded to the request made by the JVP for the SLMC to refrain from recognising those who pass out as doctors from SAITM, the JVP leader said money and politics had made the SLMC and the government to stand firm on this matter.
He said SLMC should follow the recommendations made by the 10-member committee it had appointed.
?The ten member committee comprising Prof. Rezvi Sheriff, Dr. L.B.L. de Alwis, Prof. Nilanthi de Silva, Prof. Ranil Fernando, Prof. Ranjani Gamage, Prof. Wasantha Gunathunga, Dr. B.J.C. Perera, Dr. Hemantha Perera, Prof. K. Sivapalan and Dr. H.M.S.S.D. Herath had recommended that SAITM graduates were not suitable to practice the medical profession given the number of shortcomings in that institution,? the JVP leader said. (Yohan Perera)

Tap water contaminated by sea water
	
The prevailing drought has created a fresh problem as it has resulted in sea water getting into the water lines in some areas.
A spokesman from the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) said sea water had flowed into some drying reservoirs. This had happened in Kalutara where sea water had contaminated Kalu Ganga and had reached the pumping station in Thebuwana. ?The water coming out of the taps was salty as a result,? DMC sources said.
The DMC said 149,668 people belonging to 45,440 families in nine districts had been adversely affected by the drought.
According to the DMC, the districts of Trincomalee, Kandy. Gampaha, Hambantota, Moneragala, Badulla, Anuradhapura, Jaffna and Mannar have also been affected.
The worst affected district is said to be Jaffna, where 24,235 families have been affected. 10,235 families have been affected in Mannar District.
The Department of Meteorology said that a slight change in the prevailing dry and cold weather is expected temporarily during next few days, particularly from January 20, 2017. Until then, the mainly fair weather is expected to continue over most parts of the island. Mist is expected in some parts of the island in the mornings, particularly in the Western, Sabaragamuwa, Southern and Central Provinces. (Yohan Perera)

They delight over politico?s plight
	
?
Bakery products, mainly bread vending tuck-tucks running on roads and byroads blaring out music to signal their presence mostly at dawn are a common sight in the country today.
?
A former purohita hailing from an area bordering a lagoon in the North of Colombo had issued a standing order to these bread-vending tuck-tuck drivers not to blare out their signal music when driving through the locality where his residence is located for the noise could disturb his young sons usually fast asleep at this time of the morning.?
Tuck-tucks had strictly observed this ban, but one day a certain driver had forgotten to switch off the microphone blaring out the usual signal music when driving past the residence of the powerful politico.
Affronted by the ?cheek? of the driver who had ?defied? the ?no-noise? order, the wife of the politico who wanted to teach a good lesson to the man had immediately got the politico?s security officers to produce him before her. And the security officers had given the chap a sound beating before releasing him from their custody. ?
The politico lost his seat at the last general poll and what was worse he was sent to remand jail on being arraigned on corruption charges.?
Bread vending Tuck-tuck drivers who are highly elated over the politico?s fall from power now make it a point to increase the volume of the music to a raucous pitch while driving past the residence of the politico. However, neither the politico?s wife nor the sons have raised a whimper about the nuisance caused by these tuck-tucks, they say.

Timely jump saved his bacon
	
A Diyawanna member who had reportedly escaped from being hauled before the FCID by making a timely political pole-vault has become the butt of much teasing by his colleagues at the council lobby and the library, they say.
?
During the previous regime, this member held a high position in a statutory body which came under the purview of a Minister who happened to be the leader of a minor political party. ?However, he made a big fuss over a steel-related issue and switched his allegiance to a main political party.?
His previous boss, the political party leader and a white-collar high-up of the statutory body in question are now languishing in remand jail on charges of abusing public property. Although this Diyawanna member was facing the same charges as those his onetime political boss is facing now, he has escaped from being put on trial thanks to the ?immunity? he had acquired by making the timely jump to the main political party, they say. ??

Uva CM wants to claim compensation from Britain
	
Uva Chief Minister Chamara Sampath Dasanayake said yesterday he had decided to claim compensation from the British government for the damage caused to the Uva Province during the 1817-1818 rebellion.
He told the media that the loans granted by the World Bank should be set off against the damage caused.
?The proposal will be put forward to the Uva Provincial Council first. President Maithripala Sirisena cancelled the gazette notification by the British declaring 19 national heroes as traitors. More than 14,000 people of Uva had laid down their lives during the rebellion. Even though late in the day we must make an effort to claim compensation. The Uva Province devastated by the British still lags far behind other provinces because of the damage caused by them,? he said. (Palitha Ariyawansa)
