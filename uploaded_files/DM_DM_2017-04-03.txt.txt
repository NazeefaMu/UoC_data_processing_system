Boy remains in Australia after mother deported to SL
	
A Sri Lankan woman has been deported while her young son remains on Australian soil, the Cairns Post reported on Monday.
Immigration lawyer Frank Lanza has said his client Nilanthi Senaratne was sent home late last year after a long-running battle to remain in Australia.
Her son, who attends primary school in Cairns, was allowed to stay with his adoptive grandmother.
Mr Lanza said his client had falsely claimed refugee status on the advice of an immigration agent who was later deregistered for fraud. This was almost 10 years ago, he said.
He convinced her to make this application, which was totally wrong.
We were trying to say the mistakes she made at the very beginning shouldnt reflect her current position.
In the end, the Minister didn't take that into consideration and said she lied about being a refugee.
Immigration Minister Peter Dutton did exercise discretion in allowing Ms Senaratnes son to remain in his birth country, Australia.
It was a decision that could throw Ms Senaratne a lifeline in a couple of years.
He can apply for Australian citizenship after 10 years as a resident, allowing him to request to sponsor his mother.
Her application should have been one for a last remaining relative visa, Mr Lanza said.
In my opinion, such an application would have had a good chance of being approved.
As it turned out, she did not come to see us until after that application was refused and her application to the Minister was also refused.
Mr Lanza described the situation as sad but said he was happy to have at least kept the young boy in Australia.
Its not the case she was handcuffed and taken away  she was given assistance with an airline ticket and put on a plane, he said.
She would have been glad to stay, of course, but she couldnt because she didnt have a visa.
The boy, as far as Im aware, is OK. Hes surrounded by the love of his (adoptive) grandma and hes got an aunty in Cairns.

Judging character from the shape of the hand
	
By A.S. Fernando
The shape of the hand provides a wealth of information relating to the character and the peculiarities of the subject, say great palmists who have gathered knowledge through research and experience.
The hand is divided into three distinct parts as
The Hand proper
The Fingers and
The Thumb
The Hand Proper (back)extends from the wrist to the lower knuckles of the fingers. The Palm proper (front) extends from the wrist to the base of the four fingers and of the Thumb.
The Fingers, four in number, each is divided into three phalanges, the first or the nailed one, the second and the third connecting with the Hand Proper.
The Thumb consists of two phalanges only. The lower portion of the Thumb is attached to the wrist and it is also one of the metacarpal bones forming the Palm Proper. It is not a phalange.
Readers have to note that the Hand as a whole is the back of the hand from the wrist to the finger tips.
The Hand Proper is the back of the hand from the wrist to the knuckles at the base of the fingers.
The Palm is the inside of the hand from the wrist to the base of fingers.
There are seven types of Hands each with a specific shape. They are:
The Elementary or the
 lowest type
The Square or the useful hand
The spatulate or nervous
 active hand
The Philosophical or the
 jointed hand
The Conic or the artistic hand
Psychic or idealistic hand
The Mixed hand
The Elementary Hand as the name suggests is the lowest of all types of hand. It is characterized by stiff, thick fingers, a clumsy Thumb, the nailed phalanx turned back, a hard palm and shapeless finger tips. The hand as a whole is short and thick.
The owners of the elementary hand possess little mental development and skills developed by the brain. They fit into occupations requiring unskilled manual labour. They have a violent temper and are unable to bridle their passions. They are guided by instinct rather than by reason. They have no ambitions and are quite contented if they have enough to eat, drink and have a place to sleep.
The Square or the useful hand: This type of hand is called square hand because it is square in shape. Even the nailed phalanges of such a hand are square.
The Thumb of the Square type is, however, often long, well-shaped, set high on the palm and stands well away from the palm. 
People with this type of hand are pragmatic, logical and materialistic. They are solid serious workers, not idealists or visionaries.
They are said to be narrow-minded respecters of the letter of the law. They are firm and resolute in their views, especially if their thumb is long and the first joint is stiff.
We can recognize this type easily when we see the back or the reverse of the hand. There are several knots on the fingers of this type of hand.
The Spatulate or the workmans hand: It is usually crooked or irregular-looking with large finger tips. The nailed phalanges of the fingers of the Spatulate type present the appearance more or less of a flattened spatula. People with this type of hand are untiring persistent workers full of energy. They are inventive, unconventional and emotional. 
Unlike the Square type, the Spatulate type possesses much imagination. These persons do not sit idle while the world passes by. Even if they are born poor, they would eventually rise to a high position by the dint of their perseverance.

Motorist involved in hit-n-run nabbed
	
A motorist who had allegedly hit and ran a homeless man in the Horton Place with his Porsche sports coupe last Sunday had been nabbed by the Cinnamon Gardens Police yesterday following a thorough operation, the Police said.
Cinnamon Gardens Police responding to a public telephone call launched a strenuous investigation to find the motorist responsible for the death of a homeless man, who was found lying in a pool of blood on the Horton Place on early March 26 morning.
A team of Cinnamon Gardens Police Traffic Branch led by its OIC Indika Kumara and SI Suraj Abeseykara reached the scene of crime around 5.45 a.m. and rushed the victim to the Colombo National Hospital.
The unidentified man was pronounced dead upon admission.
The body was kept at the morgue until his identity was determined, the police said.
ASP Colombo City Traffic Central D. L. A. Suriyabandara initiated an investigation to find the motorist to soon realise that no trace of the car could be found in any of the Police CCTV cameras situated near the Wijerama Junction on the Horton Place following the accident.
The officers then collected private CCTV camera footage that led them to a clue of a car passing the scene at high speed towards the Alexandra Place Roundabout.
The car that goes through Green Path to Liberty Roundabout entered Duplication Road (R.A. De Mel Mawatha) and quickly takes a turn into Clifford Avenue near the Expo Lanka Office, according to Police.
The detectives then sought the help of Department of Motor Traffic to trace the vehicle and collect registration details of the suspect vehicle. The search returned 160 red coloured two door sports cars.
The probe was narrowed down to 12 probable cars and finally the ownership details of the vehicle suspected to be linked to the case was found.
The Police team was surprised to learn that the owner was from the same neighbourhood in the Horton Place.
The suspect was subsequently taken into custody and when inquired, the motorist had admitted that it was him, who met with the accident.
The motorist had told the Police that he thought it was an animal that hit his car. He had reportedly sent the expensive car to a mechanical garage in Dehiwela which was later taken into custody by the Police.
The Suspect was produced before Colombo Traffic Court and was ordered to be remanded by Acting Magistrate Chamini Wijebandara. When contacted ASP Suriyabandara said that it was one of the strenuous probes in the traffic field they did with hardly any clue in the hand. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

MR will have to weep by Vesak next year: PM
	
Responding to a statement made by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa that he will topple the government by the time the country celebrate Vesak, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today said the former President will have to weep by the time Sri Lanka celebrates Vesak in 2018.
The Prime Minister made this remark at the United National Party rally in Kiribathgoda this evening.
The former President initially said he will topple the government in January this year. I said he can do it when I go abroad but he did not do so. However he will actually have to cry before Vesak in 2018 as the results of this government's development plans will begin to show around that time" he said.
He then went on to say that a Thai company had come to look at the possibility of establishing a trade zone in Kalutara while negotiations will begin with Singapore and India to develop the East. He said he would go to India and Japan shortly to start up negotiations. The Prime Minister aided that the government had made concrete plans to take the country out of the debt trap. He said leasing out the Hambantota Port was one way through which the government was going to do it. The government will have no choice but to increase VAT if it does not go ahead with the leasing of the Port, he said
The Prime Minister then questioned as to why the previous government agreed to start paying off the funds it borrowed from Exim Bank to construct the Hambantota Port in 2016 without having longer grace period till 2020. He then questioned as to why the then government signed an agreement to give a stake of the Hambantota Port to China and also to why a portion of reclaimed land under the Colombo Port City was given outright to China.

Mundane Astrology
	
By Sandagomi
This well-known quote from Shakespeares play, Julius Caesar, reminds us that peoples from all parts of the world from ancient times have believed that extra-terrestrial phenomena exert a tremendous influence and impact directly and indirectly on man and his environment on earth. Of course, the peoples in ancient civilizations like Roman and Hellenic of the West attributed both awesome extra-terrestrial and terrestrial phenomena to the works of the gods of antiquity as manifestations of their approval or disapproval.

Origin of Astrology
However, sages in ancient civilizations like Egypt, Babylonia and Sumer, as well as Rishis in ancient India through years of observation and reasoning hit upon a more rational explanation for the seemingly inexplicable extra-terrestrial and terrestrial phenomena. They discovered that these phenomena are the effects produced by the natural forces in the universe eternally at work  basically the effects produced by the Sun and the other planets in the Solar system on human life and every other form of life and entity that constitute the environment on earth. Ancient Indian sages in particular placed on record the findings of their studies and this body of knowledge developed and rationalized over the ages came to be known as Astrology.

What is Mundane Astrology
What is widely practiced today is Natal Astrology which is intended to foresee what is in store for an individual  often referred to as a native or a subject - fortunes and misfortunes that await him and in fact, a horoscope cast for the purpose represents the entire biography of the subject.
Ordinary readers may be familiar with forecasts being made by astrologers regarding possible landmark political events and changes and also natural disasters which invariably receive wide publicity in mass media. These forecasts are made on the basis of a separate branch of Astrology called Mundane Astrology, a term possibly strange to most of them.
Mundane Astrology is considered the most ancient branch of Astrology which is a field of study dealing with the influence and impact that the heavenly bodies in their cyclic movements make on human life and environment in a specific part of the earth. Indian Jyotish Guru Dr. B.V. Raman says: Mundane Astrology means astrology of the state or national astrology which helps us to predict the general events in different countries, like wars, plagues, pestilences, revolutions and incidents that directly affect a state or the head of a state which consequently tell upon the people.
Mundane Astrology also can be described as Geopolitical Astrology, because it can provide insights into topical political affairs and make forecasts which may at times serve as warnings to the political leadership concerned.

New page for the Girl Guides
	
One hundred years needs celebrations and that was exactly what the Sri Lanka Girl Guides Association did at Kandy Bogambara Stadium, Kandy with the Chair - World Board, World Association of Girl Guides Nicola Grinstead. 
The Guides Association in Sri Lanka decided to celebrate their Centenary year in Kandy, since Guiding was born in Kandy and that at a prestigious school - Girls High School Kandy, founded by a British woman. 
This short note is not to speak so much of Guiding as a whole and does not want to tread on anothers toe. But, since the celebrations were in Kandy with political backing, it would be appropriate to know how Guiding came into the country and then to commence youth building in that region. 
Sifting through various papers the writer had , since Girls High school was a sister school of Kingswood and being a Kings Scout with the National Service Award, there were papers connected with the formation of the first Guide group at this prestigious school in the Hills. 
Credit should go to a woman who came from England - Miss Jane Calverley in February 1917. 
She had a thorough knowledge of Guiding and became a source of strength to the Principal at that time Miss F.R. Samson. As an educationist, she was building up the school and the presence of Calverley was a boom to go ahead to form the first Guide Company in the country, commencing from Girls High school on 21st of March 1917. 
Jane Calverley (Later to become Jane Green) became so popular that she was nick named Sunshine Jane. 
She saw the difficulties of the normal school girl in the country visited their homes and came to know the difficulties. She best came out when she put her foot forward during the outbreak of plague in 1920. The infected area was Brownrigg Street, which today is Yatinuwara Veediya and the school been in Brownrigg street church premises. The school had to be shifted, a part of it went to YMCA, and the other went to the Trinity College. 
Calverley took the initiative and did her best. 
At that time she was in addition the Acting Principal of the school. She went on furlough, and then was posted to Matara Wesley School. So, she left behind a trail, for the future of Sri Lanka. 
That seed, she planted in 1917, was celebrated as the Centenary of Guiding in Sri Lanka. 
The first Committee established for the purpose of Guiding had as its President Lady Stubbs - the wife of the Governor and Mrs. Dyson  the wife of the Government Agent as the District Commissioner. - the wife of the Government Agent. 
The Principal, Miss F.R. Samson was elected as the Secretary and Miss L. Janz the Honorary Treasurer. 


"When talking about Scouting and Girl Guides, the founder of the movement - Robert Baden Powell and also Jenny Calverley Greene at Girls High School who established the first Girl Guide Company in Sri Lanka in1917 should be remembered with respect Honour and warm sincere gratitude"

Mrs. Stubbs whenever she was in Kandy used to invite the Guides for tea at Kings Pavilion. 
Still some of those who are living recall the time spent on the lawn of Kings pavilion where tea was served. 
By July the Guides were ready to be tested for their  tenderfoot badges by the Scout Master of the Kings Troop Mr. F.H. de Saram - that was first Kandy (Dharmaraja). Dharmaraja came to be known as Kings Troop, since they won the Kings Flag thrice in the competition World over 
With the receipt of the Captains Warrant as the first Ceylonese Guide Captain Miss. Gladys Vanderstraaten, the first enrolment ceremony was held in December 1917. Unfortunately, Lady Stubbs who should have been present did not arrive as planned due to another engagement. 
In the meantime, the Chief Guide Madam Baden Powell arrived in the country in 1921 and visited Kandy, when the newly formed Guide company impressed her. Before her departure, Lady Baden Powell wrote of her impressions from Temple Trees where she was the guest of the Governor, to Miss Calverley. 


"The 1st Committee for guiding had as its President Lady Stubbs - wife of the Governor and Mrs. Dyson  wife of the Government Agent as the District Commissioner. "

Another first in the country was the Brownie movement for the youngest in the school, which was established an year after the Guide Company and Miss D. Woutersz was the first  Owl. 
This short note would not be complete, if the Chief Minister is not quoted. 
He said at this Centenary event, that he was happy to be at the celebrations as the Chief Minister and also as a member and President of the Kandy District Scout movement. He said that where the Guide movement is considered, it is one of the key curriculum activities absorbed in to the countrys education system. 
He said that the President Maithripala Sirisena was to grace the occasion, not as the President, but as the Chief Scout of Sri Lanka since 2015. But due some urgent assignments he was unable to be present on this occasion, but his blessings have been extended for the event. He also welcomed the Chair, World Board World Association of Girl Guides Madam Nicola Grinstead. 
Speaking further, the Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake said: 
When talking about Scouting and Girl Guides, the founder of the movement - Robert Baden Powell and also Jenny Calverley Greene at Girls High School who established the first Girl Guide Company in Sri Lanka in1917 should be remembered with respect Honour and warm sincere gratitude. 
He also said that this event would add a new page to the history of the Girl Guides Association.

President cant reshuffle Cabinet: Gammanpila
	
President Maithripala Sirisena has not been given the authority from the 19th Amendment to the Constitution to reshuffle the Cabinet, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila said today.
According to the 43 (1) and (2) clauses of the Constitution, he said the consent of the Prime Minister is needed for the President to make a decision about Cabinet Ministers.
When the Constitution was amended, the Supreme Court maintained the stance that a referendum is required if any amendment was to be made in order to devolve Executive powers and give them to the post of Prime Minister. However, by a mere mistake, clauses 43 (1) and (2) had been gone ignored. Hence, the President cant make the final decision on a Cabinet reshuffle, he told a news conference.
The clause 43 (1) of the Constitution states the President shall, in consultation with the Prime Minister, should determine the number of Ministers of the Cabinet and the assignment of subjects and functions to such Ministers.
Clause 43 (2) states the President shall, on the advice of the Prime Minister, appoint from among Members of Parliament, Ministers, to be in charge of the Ministries so determined.
However, clause 43 (3) says the President may at any time change the assignment of subjects and functions and the composition of the Cabinet of Ministers. It also says such changes shall not affect the continuity of the Cabinet of Ministers and the continuity of its responsibility to Parliament.
News reports earlier said a Cabinet reshuffle was around the corner and Finance Ministry was one of the key ministries which were to be changed. It was also reported that United National Party (UNP) was not in favour of a reshuffle. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Rainbow Economics: The right way and the wrong way
	
Homophobia, Transphobia and overall, the social phobia against the entire Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersex and Questioning community is not just an emotional shock.
The discrimination originating from these phobias not only hurts people, but also destroys families, workplaces and societies. It leaves a negative impact on the national economy of a country, although many may deny this assertion. 
Allowing the existing laws to criminalise citizens based on their sexual orientation and gender identity is senseless and useless. These discriminations are clearly a waste of valuable human potential on a grand scale. 
There is clear evidence that when societies enact such laws, they prevent productive people from fully participating in the workforce, leading to economic implosion.
According to research of the issues faced by the worlds LGBTIQ population, Homophobia and Transphobia can lead to loss of employment, workplace or educational discrimination, poor health, and poverty which makes a fairly large section of the population  as much as 10% in Sri Lanka - non participants in the overall GDP growth of the country.
The continued invisibility of an LGBTIQ population, particularly in the developing world, means research remains a challenge. But, even with the existing data and analysis, there is ample evidence to prove that there is so much more to gain economically for Sri Lanka if we embrace diversity and stop marginalising the LGBTIQ community. Despite this understanding, Sri Lanka continues to marginalise this community through archaic laws such as section 365 and 365A of the Sri Lanka Penal Code, criminalising them for sexual activities conducted in private among consenting adults. Thus, decriminalising not only breaks the social barriers but allows these men and women to be a proud part of the national economic growth and enjoy its benefits  just like all other citizens.
Violation of human rights is likely to have a harmful effect on a countrys level of economic development.


"Allowing the existing laws to criminalise citizens based on their sexual orientation and gender identity is senseless and useless."

According to a report published by the World Bank in 2013, discrimination towards the LGBTIQ community of India cost the country billions of dollars in lost revenue. Quoting Ashish Patel from the Wall Street journal, Homophobia in the workplace in India and lost productivity as a result of discrimination are among some of the findings in a report by U.S.- based economist M.V. Lee Badgett that is part of an upcoming study for the World Bank. Ms. Badgetts study also looks at how homophobia triggers high rates of depression and suicidal behaviour, which can also affect the economy. With this, Ms. Badgett estimates that homophobia cost Indias economy between 112 billion rupees ($1.9 billion) and 1.7 trillion rupees ($30.8 billion) in 2012. To put that figure into context: India lost between 0.1% to 1.7% of its potential gross domestic product that year. (http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2014/06/10/how-homophobia-hurts-indias-economy/)
While no such study has been conducted in Sri Lanka, we can learn from the experiences of our closest neighbour India. The Question is  should Sri Lanka continue to copy its unfortunate neighbour or should Sri Lanka be the beacon, the leader in paving the way for LGBTIQ citizens to be productive, contributing citizens As we struggle to gain our economic strength after many years of war and economic down-trends, should we not stop a moment to think how we can stride forward without constantly going backwards
There is much to gain and nothing to lose by accepting and embracing Diversity in all forms in this country. So, what really is at stake here. Why should we be so concerned about nearly 10% of this country and what it can bring to the table
According to Nielsen The LGBT community is a significant contributor to the U.S. economy, and savvy companies should plan their strategies accordingly.

The Business Insider states that LGBT persons spend more than US$800 billion annually in the US. It is, for many companies, a still largely untapped demographic that they are keen to start tapping.
Here are just a few statistics which give a picture of LGBT consumers and the differences in spending power of gay households vs. the American general market: (http://www.businessinsider.com/lgbt-community-untapped-market-consumer-brands-2013-6) 

	23% higher median household income
	
	
	24% more equity in their homes
	
	
	26% of gay men say they will pay more for top quality brands
	
	
	30% have taken a major vacation in the past year
	
	
	40% bought a new smart phone in the past year

According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, it is estimated that LGBT travel generates over $65 billion annually in the US alone. (http://www.marketingmag.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/LastQ_LGBT_0612)
More and more companies worldwide are adopting policies to safeguard LGBTIQ in the workplace. These companies know that LGBTQ equality isnt just the right thing to do, it makes them stronger in the global economy. Ensuring fairness in the workplace is a value and increasingly a policy norm, and not just in the U.S. or Canada or the UK. Now, many businesses have embraced both sexual orientation and gender identity employment protections for their global and local operations.
It is very unfortunate that very little research exists in the developing world to support the argument that LGBTIQ persons in the workforce can only enhance and uplift our economy in a way that is essential to a country such as ours. We can refute the obvious, we can choose to ignore data from other countries but choosing to ignore what is in front of us only leads to increasing deprivation than bounty.


"Governments choose to use the whip instead of the feather to modernise this country clinging on to archaic laws and practices "

More access to rights, more protections under the law, more access to proper education and training  this will contribute greatly to LGBTIQ persons achieving their full economic potential and thus contributing to the coffers of this country in taxes and spending value. Just think how much in taxes we can collect from 2 million more people in the workplace This is just the beginning in calculating what a financial bonus it will be once we decriminalise homosexuality!
So many countries are now embracing modern economic concepts such as strategic modernisation and prefer to use LGBTIQ rights strategically to promote and expand economies.
Since independence, Sri Lanka has boasted about evolving as a vibrant modern economy. Yet, years and years of discrimination, conservative religious extremism, racism, and misogyny has kept our country chained to development aid and handouts. We will eternally be a developing country with no hope for the marginalised. The real question is, whether everyone can equally enjoy the benefits of national economic development in a country like Sri Lanka. The answer is, unfortunately not. It seems that only a handful of persons in the right places can do so while citizens belonging to social minorities such as the LGBTIQ community, continue to be discriminated against and marginalised. It is very strange that successive Governments choose to use the whip instead of the feather to modernise this country while still clinging on to archaic laws and practices and conservative mind sets that only serve to drag our country backwards rather than striding forward - rich in diversity and vibrant with hope and vision.
You can achieve great economic gains by solving social problems.

Special Forces lead operation to drive jihadists from vital dam
	

Iraq, (Daily Mail, London), 1 April 2017 - 
British Special Air Service has launched a series of devastating aerial assaults behind Islamic States lines  claiming a decisive victory over the terrorist group and paving the way for a final battle to wipe out the jihadis in their stronghold. 
The top-secret raids have secured a strategically vital air base in Syria from which Britain and its allies can attack the nearby city of Raqqa, where of terrorists were preparing to fight to the death. 
A monumental hydroelectric dam that the terrorists have been threatening to destroy  potentially killing thousands of civilians  was also captured after a brutal firefight that went on for several hours as the SAS-led forces met heavy resistance. 
As the battle raged, support came from US Marines who had crossed the Euphrates river in Combat Rubber Raiding Craft.

The past that refuses to be forgotten
	
It is difficult to imagine anything more traumatic than the sudden disappearance of a loved one. The scramble for any facts that can be established with any clarity. The yearning to know, the pain of imagining. The flame of hope that subsides to a barely perceptible flicker, never quite extinguished by the passage of time. There can be no real certainty, no closure, no moving on. 
Sithy Ameena, Sandya Ekneligoda and Vathana Sunthararaj all share this sense of perpetual grief. Though the critical voices of their children and husbands may have been silenced as a result of their enforced disappearances, these women have refused to fade into anonymity and stay quiet. Standing in for the disappeared, they are asking Sri Lanka to account for its harrowing past. 
Twenty six years of armed conflict, which reached a brutal climax in 2009, has left an indelible mark on the nation. In its wake, Sri Lankans are still grappling with what will happen to their land and property and how they will be compensated for wrongs they have suffered. 
One of the most important questions many are asking is this: what happened to their loved ones Enforced disappearances have occurred on a staggering scale in Sri Lanka, affecting every community and uniting them in grief. The perpetrators came from all sides - not just the government, but also the LTTE. With backlogs of up to 100,000 cases of unresolved disappearances dating back to the 1980s, there is no shortage of examples of cruelty. 
The legal term may be clunky - enforced disappearance - but the human story is simple: People literally disappear, from their loved ones, when state officials (or someone acting with state consent) grab them from the street or from their homes and then deny it, or refuse to say where they are. It is a crime under international law. Yet the families of victims are often given no easy route to seeking justice and are unable to properly mourn their loss. 
Whether Sri Lanka could deliver on the demands of families of the disappeared for truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence is the acid test for broader efforts to address impunity in the country. 


"I met with PM Ranil Wickremesinghe who affirmed that the cabinet was discussing a roadmap for the implementation of an accountability process. They must commit to a public timeline in order to restore the peoples confidence that justice is on track and assure them that they are serious about taking action. The victims cannot wait any longer"

But there are some who argue that the country could only start building its future by forgetting this past. This would be unwise, if not impossible. While those who have been forcibly made to disappear may no longer be physically present, the impact of their absence weighs heavily. Their loved ones struggle to make ends meet, because they may have now lost the main breadwinner. Children, both Sinhala and Tamil, are being raised by grandparents or single parents. For communities across the country, there is no forgetting. 
That is why, today, Amnesty International is publishing a new report on enforced disappearances in Sri Lanka. In solidarity with the victims, our report aims to shine a light on the stories of the families and their seemingly endless search for justice. 


"The perpetrators came from all sides - not just the government, but also the LTTE. With backlogs of up to 100,000 cases of unresolved disappearances dating back to the 1980s"

Sandya Ekneligoda has been a key figure in helping to raise the profile of these grievous crimes. When her husband, the political cartoonist Prageeth Ekneligoda, disappeared two days before the 2010 presidential elections, she embarked on a long quest for justice. She lodged complaints at two police stations, but neither took any obvious steps to investigate his disappearance. She appealed to the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka; the Attorney General; the President and his wife; the UN Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances; and the ICRC. She travelled to Geneva, Switzerland to attend the HRC session and press on her husbands case. 
Sandyas tenacity has pushed the authorities to open new investigations that uncovered evidence of involvement by military intelligence personnel in the disappearance. To date, she has attended court hearings at least 90 times since she first lodged her complaints. Her struggle is far from over. 
Like Sandya, Sithy Ameena, Vathana Sunthararaj and the other women featured in our briefing, families of the disappeared know what they want and what they need. If Sri Lanka is to succeed in overcoming its violent past, policymakers must put the victims demands for genuine and effective measures to deliver justice, truth, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence at the centre of its transitional justice process. 


"It is now a matter of when, not if. Nearly eight years have elapsed since Sri Lankas civil war ended, yet the government has asked the UNHRC for another two years to probe alleged war crimes, as well as enforced disappearances"

It is now a matter of when, not if. Nearly eight years have elapsed since Sri Lankas civil war ended, yet the government has asked the UNHRC for another two years to probe alleged war crimes, as well as enforced disappearances. While dealing with historical human rights abuses may require time, delaying will only serve to compound the suffering many have already gone through. 
I met with PM Ranil Wickremesinghe who affirmed that the cabinet was discussing a roadmap for the implementation of an accountability process. They must commit to a public timeline in order to restore the peoples confidence that justice is on track and assure them that they are serious about taking action. The victims cannot wait any longer.

TU action can't change Court ruling: Kiriella
	
Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said today there appears to be a plot to destabilize the government through the SATIM issue but whatever it might be Court orders could not be changed through trade union action or hunger strikes.
He said the Court had recognized the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) and as such there was no way for the Government to scrap it or close it down.
Some people are resorting to the new practice of challenging court orders. If we close down SAITM we will be hauled to Court for contempt. Court orders cannot be changed by stopping work, boycotting lecturers or through street protests that inconvenience the public, the minister said.
He told a news conference that the government would strengthen the free education system in Sri Lanka and hopes to start two medical faculties in the North-Western Province and Ratnapura.
It is the UNP which introduced free education to Sri Lanka. We will not allow anyone to destroy it. Some people are citing SAITM and attempting to show that we are against free education. There is nothing wrong in setting up private medical universities if done so under proper standards, he said.
Mr. Kiriella said even though the government was doing its best to resolve the SAITM issue, the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) by not attending the discussions convened by the President was refusing to cooperate with the government.
The SLMC has a separate agenda. It did not attend the discussions convened by the President to discuss this matter and did not protest when the SAITM was established during the previous regime, he said.
He said some factions such as the GMOA were urging that minimum standards for medical education be gazetted but the SLMC and medical faculty heads, who were responsible, were not drafting them so that they could be gazetted without delay. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne today refused to grant bail for MP Wimal Weerawansa on exceptional circumstance of his daughter being admitted to a hospital.
The Magistrate said that there were no sufficient reports in court which could explain the health condition of the suspect's daughter.
MP Weerawansa was not brought to the Courts today by the Prison Authorities because he was currently being treated at the Colombo National Hospital.
Earlier, defence counsel put forward the bail application on the ground of exceptional circumstance that the suspect's daughter was admitted to hospital due to bad mental health condition after her father was remanded. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
