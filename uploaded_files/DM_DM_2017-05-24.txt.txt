Archaeological sites and wildlife: Hakeem calls for PSC
	
Minister Rauff Hakeem said today a Parliament Select Committee (PSC) should be appointed to look into issues concerning archaeological sites and wildlife and national parks.
He said the recent decisions on archaeological sites, wildlife and national parks had created problems for political parties which represent people in the North and East and that a lasting solution should be provided for these contentious issues through a PSC.
The minister said this in response to a statement made by Deputy Minister Anurada Jayaratne, in response to a question asked by JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake regarding archaeological sites in the Ampara District.
He said that statements on vandalism of archaeological sites would create wrong impressions among the people and added that the matter should be discussed at length with relevant officials in the district.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said he would discuss the matter of appointing a PSC at the next party leaders' meeting. (Ajith Siriwardana)

At least 22 dead following terrorist incident in England
	

By Griff Witte, Peter Holley  
c) 2017, The Washington Post  May 23, 2017 - 
LONDON - An explosion described by police as a likely terrorist attack ripped through a crowd of teenagers and other concertgoers late Monday after a performance by an American pop singer in the English city of Manchester, leaving at least 19 people dead and about 50 injured. 
Initial evidence at the scene suggested the attack may have been a suicide bombing, according to two U.S. security officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation. British authorities, who were meeting in emergency sessions in Manchester and London, did not immediately confirm those reports. 
The bombing appeared intended to inflict the maximum possible damage on young concertgoers - many of them in their early teens - who were making their way out of the Manchester Arena. Police said the blast occurred about 10:30 p.m., minutes after pop star Ariana Grande had finished her set. 
The explosion set off a panicked reaction as fans struggled to flee and parents and teens searched for each other amid the carnage. Well into Tuesday morning, fathers and mothers who had lost contact with their children posted desperate pleas for information on social media. 
British Prime Minister Theresa May issued a statement in the early hours of Tuesday saying that authorities were working to establish the full details of what is being treated by the police as an appalling terrorist attack. 
Greater Manchester Police said the blast was being treated as a terrorist incident until police know otherwise. 
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast, and police did not speculate about possible motives. 
If confirmed as a terrorist attack, it would be the worst strike on British soil since 2005, when Islamist extremists bombed the London subway and a bus, killing 54 people. 
Britain has been on high alert for a major attack for several years, with authorities saying that a mass-casualty attack was likely. 
Manchester police said they were working closely with national authorities to determine the cause of the explosion. Among the priorities for investigators will be to figure out whether it was part of a broader plot. 
Grande, who is wildly popular both in Britain and the United States, was not injured in the attack. She expressed her sorrow in a tweet hours after the explosion, saying she was broken. from the bottom of my heart, I am so sorry. I dont have words. 
Cellphone video showed chaotic scenes of people screaming and running in the aftermath of the blast. The arena was packed with attendees and pink balloons that had fallen from the ceiling during the final song. Initially, concertgoers said they thought popping balloons had set off a panic, or that the screams were those of fans who had caught a glimpse of Grande. 
The local hospital, Wythenshawe, said it was dealing with mass casualties.
Five other hospitals across the city were activated to treat the injured, and emergency supplies of blood were rushed in. 
Heavily armed police and emergency services swarmed the arena, with ambulances - their blue lights flashing - rushing to the scene. The local emergency-response service advised the public to call only for life-threatening emergencies. 
Many of those attending the concert were teenagers going to their first concert. Witnesses reported that outside the arena, parents were frantically attempting to locate their children. Many parents and teens later gathered at a nearby Holiday Inn that was established as a meeting point. 
Parents posted pictures of missing children on social media, pleading for information. Police set up a hotline for those looking to connect with missing relatives.

## Title: Cervical cancer A simple screening  test might save  your life

Cervical cancer A simple screening  test might save  your life
	

Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer after breast cancer occurring in Sri Lankan women. It also has a high chance of cure if diagnosed early, when compared to other cancers. Incidentally the screening test for cervical cancer, commonly known as the Pap smear, remains the most successful screening test for cancer developed to date and is freely available in the government sector. Therefore it is unfortunate that many women forego this life-saving opportunity due to lack of knowledge on the subject. This week, Health Capsule consulted Dr. Jayantha Balawardane, Senior Consultant Oncologist, Radiotherapist and senior lecturer, Kotelawala Defence University hospital to get more information on cervical cancer.
How is cervical cancer diagnosed
One doesnt contact cancer as soon as one gets infected with HPV. There could be almost a 15-year gap from the time the woman gets infected to the point where she develops cancer. During this time, the cervix undergoes gradual malignant changes, which could be detected by the simple screening test known as the pap smear, where a few scraped-off cells from the cervix are examined under a microscope. Detection of these changes in the earlier stages is preferable because once it progresses to frank cancer, the treatment methods become more complex. 

What are the treatment options available
If the malignant changes are identified in the very early stages, only the tissues containing the lesions can be incised and removed in a procedure called cone biopsy. In this method, the childbearing ability of the woman is preserved. But if the cancer is somewhat spread through the cervix, the treatment option required is a surgery. In these cases, the uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes, the upper part of the vagina as well as the supporting tissues of the uterus and pelvic lymph nodes are removed in a procedure called the Werthimes hysterectomy. If the cancer are very advanced, chemotherapy and radiotherapy is given in place of surgery. Both external radiation and per vaginal internal radiation as well as chemotherapy are combined in this treatment method.
Due to modern advanced treatments, even patients in the advanced stages of cancer now have comparatively high chances of survival. 


Who is at a higher risk of contacting this disease
Women who begin their sexual lives early have a higher chance of getting cervical cancer. Women with multiple sexual partners, especially commercial sex workers, also have a higher incidence of the disease. Even though males do not display symptoms of HPV, they can contact HPV through sexual contact with an infected person and act as carriers of the virus and are known as high-risk males. Therefore, even if a woman has a single sexual partner throughout her life, if her male partner has had other sexual partners, theres a chance of her contracting the infection through him, which may ultimately lead to cervical cancer. Research has also shown that women who smoke have a higher tendency to get cervical cancer when compared to non- smokers. 


Prevention
When it comes to the prevention of cervical cancer, we should talk about three things. The first is having one faithful sexual partner. The second is vaccination for HPV. It covers 98% of HPV infections for a period of about 15 years. In developed countries, it is given to all teenage girls as part and parcel of the immunization schedule. In Sri Lanka it is readily available in the private sector at a small cost. The third is the use of barrier methods like condoms and refraining from practising unsafe sex. These methods might provide a certain amount of protection against HPV and other sexually transmitted diseases, though it is not 100 percent effective he added.
Message toSri Lankan women
Dr. Balawardane stresses on the need for every female who has been sexually active at some point in her life to get screened for cervical cancer. He also advises women who have post-coital bleeding to seek immediate medical care, because this is usually the first visible symptom of cervical cancer. Symptoms like unusual vaginal discharge, pelvic pain and irregular vaginal bleeding may also occur. Cervical cancer can be defeated through spreading awareness and timely diagnosis and treatment. 
The Sri Lankan situation
About five years back, most patients coming in for treatment for cervical cancer were in the last stages. Today, however, more and more cases are identified early because people are more informed and have access to improved screening facilities in the country, especially in the Well Woman clinics. Unfortunately, the number of patients identified from rural areas are lower, because they are less educated and are reluctant to get screened.

Charting his new political journey
	

A state purohita recently took the country by surprise with his outburst that he was seriously considering quitting politics for he could no longer tolerate the step-motherly treatment being meted out to him. .

Close friends of the state purohita had another surprise coming to them soon afterwards when they learnt that the unhappy worthy was a conspicuous presence at the pinkama held at the residence of a sister of the former strongman the day after his outburst.
The state purohita  a onetime harsh critic of the former royal family - was seen in intimate conversation with the political sibling of the former strongman while the pinkama was in progress. By the way, he was the only politico from the government side to have participated in this event, they say. The movements of this politico have now come under the close surveillance of both government and opposition bigwigs,they say.

Countering Cirrhosis
	

By Janani Angammana
Cirrhosis is a complication of the liver which develops when scar tissue replaces the normal, healthy tissue in your liver. This takes place when healthy cells are damaged over a long period of time, usually after many years. These scar tissues cause the liver to become hard and lumpy and may lead to liver failure. It also makes it difficult for blood to flow through the large vein that leads to the liver. Due to this, the blood will back up into the portal vein and may enter the spleen, causing complications in that organ as well. The only cure for cirrhosis is a kidney transplant; but one can also consult a doctor and slow down cirrhosis by treating its cause. Health Capsule spoke to Professor Arjuna De Silva, a Gastroenterologist, on how cirrhosis can be dealt with. Cirrhosis is considered to be present when 75% of the liver is damaged. In the past, we thought cirrhosis was not reversible but now we have found that it is. At the moment if you want to cure cirrhosis, a liver transplant must be done. Usually in Sri Lanka, the main cause of cirrhosis is due to alcoholism and a fatty liver. Women are more prone to fatty liver than men. The annual mortality rate per 100,000 people from cirrhosis in Sri Lanka has increased by 110.0% since 1990, an average of 4.8% a year.
Cirrhosis can be caused due to: Alcohol-related liver disease
Alcohol addiction is a risk factor for cirrhosis. It causes inflammation and fatty deposits in the liver. The consumption pattern of alcohol should be different for men and women. Women shouldnt have more than one drink and men shouldnt have more than two drinks per day. 
Viral hepatitis
Hepatitis is the inflammation of the liver. It can be caused by the heavy use of alcohol, certain medical conditions and some medications and is most often caused by viruses. Hepatitis C is the most common variety in the United States. You can get either of these by coming into contact with infected blood. This might happen if you:

Stick yourself with a needle by accident 
	Share needles to inject drugs 
	Had a blood transaction in the past 
	Have intercourse with someone with the disease
Hepatitis D also can cause cirrhosis. 
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
Even if a person is not addicted to alcohol, there is still a risk of fat building up in the liver. There are certain reasons for extra fat to be present in the liver: 

Being overweight 
	Diabetes 
	High cholesterol and Triglycerides in the blood 
	High blood pressure 
	Metabolic syndrome 
Autoimmune hepatitis
In some people, the body defences (immune system) go haywire, attacking the liver. According to doctors, it is probably genetic. Autoimmune is more common in women than in men. 
Bile duct disease or damage
These bile ducts are small tubes that carry bile from the liver to the small intestine. Cirrhosis is caused in these bile ducts as a result of the ducts being blocked because of an injury or disease and the bile backs up into the liver. The two conditions that can lead to bile duct damage are gallstones and cystic fibrosis. 
Medications
Some drugs can cause cirrhosis if taken for a long time. 
There are two types of cirrhosis, namely Compensated and Decompensated. 
In compensated cirrhosis, there are no symptoms. There are still enough healthy liver cells to meet the bodys needs. They compensate for the damaged cells and scared tissue. If the treatments are delayed, the liver will not be able to get rid of toxic substances in the body, like ammonia. 
Decompensated cirrhosis causes symptoms like: 

Bleeding from large blood vessels in the oesophagus 
	Fluid builds up in the belly 
	Toxins build up in blood that can cause confusion 
	Eyes and skin become yellow 
	Gallstones 
	Bruising and bleeding easily 
Individuals with cirrhosis may have some or no symptoms of liver disease. Some of these symptoms may be non-specific that is, they dont suggest that the liver is the cause. Some of the more common symptoms and signs of cirrhosis include: 

Yellowing of the skin [jaundice] 
	Fatigue 
	Weakness 
	Loss of appetite 
	Itching 
	Easy bruising from decreased production of blood clotting factors by the diseased liver 
Diagnosis
Several tests are used to confirm the diagnosis of cirrhosis and to determine the underlying cause. Other tests are useful for determining the severity of cirrhosis and for monitoring complications. 
Liver biopsy
Obtaining a small piece of tissue from the liver with a special needle during liver biopsy can be done as prescribed by your doctor. 
Imaging tests
A variety of imaging tests such as an ultrasound scan, CT scan or MRI can show whether a person has cirrhosis or not. These tests can describe the appearance of the liver and identify if there are any related complications. 
Physical examination
The physical signs of the condition will include one or more of the following: 
Jaundice 
	An enlarged liver or spleen 
	Oedema (swelling) 
	Enlarged breast tissues (in men) 
	Palmar erythema (redness of the palms) 
Laboratory tests
This can often reveal the specific underlying cause of cirrhosis. These tests can be seen in people with early cirrhosis.

Daughter demands Rs.75,000 to handover father's body
	
A daughter has solicited Rs. 75,000 from her mother to hand over the body of her father who had died at her house.
She had told her mother that she had already spent Rs. 75,000 for the funeral arrangements which has to be returned if the body is to be handed over to the mother.
The Giribawa Police said that the man had died at the daughter's house and she had made the funeral arrangements without informing her mother. The mother however, had got to know about her husband's death and gone to her daughter's house to take the body to her house.
By the time relatives and monks had visited the daughter's house and the daughter had stated that she would hand over the body to her mother only if the latter pays the money she had already spent on the funeral arrangements.
Finally the body was handed over to the mother without any payment being made with the intervention of the police.

Duterte declares martial rule in south Philippines
	
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte Wednesday enforced martial law in his countrys south as he abruptly left Moscow to deal with a crisis at home sparked by a Muslim extremist siege on a city, where militants burned buildings overnight and are feared to have taken hostages, Washington Post posted on Tuesday.
Duterte declared martial rule for 60 days in the entire southern Mindanao region, the restive third of the Philippine archipelago, Tuesday evening to try to crush Muslim extremists who have aligned themselves with the Islamic State group and occupied a hospital, jail and other buildings and battled troops in an audacious attack in Marawi City.
Martial law could be extended for a year depending on how long the problem could be quelled, Duterte said on board a plane en route to the Philippines.
I said I would be harsh and I warned everybody not to force my hand into it, Duterte said. I have to do it to preserve the republic.
Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said troops raided the hideout of a top terrorist suspect in Marawi on Tuesday, sparking a gun battle that prompted the militants to call for reinforcements from an allied group, the Maute. He said dozens of gunmen occupied city hall, a hospital and a jail and burned a Catholic church, a college and some houses in a bold attack that killed at least two soldiers and a police officer and wounded 12 others.
Several militants were killed in the fighting in Marawi city in Lanao del Sur province, about 830 kilometers (520 miles) south of Manila, but others continued to lay siege to the largely Muslim city of more than 200,000 people, officials said, adding that power was cut in the city in the chaos.

Emerging Infections in Sri Lanka
	

Tropical infections
Our country is a small island placed between 5 and 10 north of the equator and has a tropical climate. Sri Lanka has endemic transmission of many tropical diseases and has been battling them in public health campaigns. Some of these campaigns have been very successful. For example, polio, cholera and malaria transmission have been eliminated. Filariasis and leprosy prevalence rates are well below the WHO recommended elimination rate. The number of cases of human rabies has decreased significantly. Endemic tropical diseases that have been controlled to a large extent include typhoid fever, hepatitis A and dysentery, reflecting improved sanitation. Unfortunately, the incidence of tuberculosis (that is the number of new cases detected annually) remains almost constant. 
Infections that may be introduced by travel/tourism
It is gratifying to note the extremely low prevalence of HIV and Hepatitis B in Sri Lanka. This is in stark contrast to other countries in the Asia Pacific region. Increased travel and tourism from these countries mean that there is a risk of introduction of these infections to the country. For example, India, just 50 km away, has more than 10 times Sri Lankas prevalence of HIV, five times its prevalence of chronic Hepatitis B and endemic cholera. To illustrate the problem of imported infections, is it important to recall that chikungunya, a mosquito borne viral fever, found its way across the Indian Ocean from Madagascar, Mauritius and Seychelles to India and shortly afterwards to Sri Lanka with devastating impact. Influenza, both seasonal and pandemic, is introduced to the country by returning travellers or tourists and is transmitted all year round, without the winter peaks seen in temperate areas.

Emerging infections
Rice is the staple diet of the population, with many people serving rice for all three meals. The shallow, clear waters of the paddy fields are the ideal breeding ground for Culex tritaeniorhynchus, the mosquito vector of Japanese B encephalitis. Japanese B encephalitis (JE) emerged in Sri Lanka in the 1980s and wreaked a heavy toll, till an effective vaccine was introduced to the national immunization programme. 
A government sponsored effort to increase paddy cultivation resulted in many abandoned, rat-infested paddy lands being brought back into cultivation. This has been postulated as the cause for a sudden increase in the reported cases of leptospirosis. Leptospirosis, or rat fever, is contracted by the exposure of wounds or mucous membrane to water contaminated with rat urine. 
The forests that once covered most of the island have now been reduced. Deforestation results in an increase in the transmission of diseases from wild animals and birds (zoonotic diseases), as ticks, mites and sandflies, deprived of their animal hosts, look for new hosts. For example the rate of typhus fever, scrub typhus and cutaneous leishmaniasis has increased rapidly. 
Sri Lanka has a population of 21 million crammed into a country the size of Tasmania. That works out to about 317 persons per square kilometre. The bulk of the population still live in rural areas but there is migration to the cities and unplanned urbanization leading to the accumulation of mountains of garbage, which have become the breeding places for dengue mosquitoes and has fuelled the dengue epidemic. Interestingly, we have seen a change in the spatial distribution of dengue which has moved from the urban areas to semi-urban and even rural regions. One reason is the adoption of new rural breeding places by the dengue mosquito, like the coconut shell used to collect the rubber sap on rubber estates and gem pits. 
Seasonal monsoons add to the risk of emerging infections, as rain leads to an increased breeding of Aedes mosquitoes and a sharp rise in dengue transmission, with a peak in infections shortly after the end of the monsoon. 
Newly emerging infections
An emerging infection that has been described recently is melioidosis, caused by a bacterium in the soil. This infection is acquired by exposure to soil or muddy water, such as rice farming, gardening, construction work and manual labour. It is more common in diabetics. Melioidosis can appear as severe fatal infections or as abscesses in organs such as the lung, liver or spleen or as pneumonia. It is likely that the barefoot, outdoor, rural agricultural lifestyle practiced in Sri Lanka contributes to the prevalence of this infection. 

Conclusion
Conditions such as climate change, increased tourism, mechanization of agriculture, deforestation, increased urbanization and increased antibiotic resistance will lead to the introduction of new infections and the re-emergence of old infections. It is necessary to be alert to changing global and local patterns of infectious diseases.

Though powerful countries like the US, China, India and Japan were affected by global economic crisis in 2016, Sri Lanka was able to remain unaffected because of the Yahapalanaya Governments economic strategies, UNP General Secretary and Minister Kabir Hashim said today.
Addressing a media briefing at Sirikotha, Minister Hashim said the worlds economic growth was reversed in 2016 due to the drought which affected most of the counties and their agricultural industries.
The economic growth rate in China dropped down to 6.9 percent in 2015 and it was the record drop after 25 years. In 2016, Chinas economic growth rate dropped to 6.7 percent, the minister said.
He said Sri Lanka bears a huge debt burden but the present Government had managed to take the country forward and stablise the economy. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

He said if the government did not intervene to control these incidents, people would be compelled to take the law into their hands.
Mr. Dissanayake said there were attempts to provoke racial disharmony between Muslims and Sinhalese by extremist elements and that racism in any form was an obstruction to communal harmony. He said the government had created an environment conducive for communal clashes.
"The government has not taken any action against those involved in attacking Muslim religious places and no one has been arrested so far," he said and added that a majority of Sinhalese and Muslims were against extremism. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Has the controversial project taken the shine off this Ministry
	

The Betel leaf party  the other partner of the national unity coalition  has been offered a certain Ministry now being held by a Green party politico. This offer has been made in view of the reshuffle of the top team in the offing.

The Ministry on offer to the Betel leaf party is the one due to implement a controversial major development project in collaboration with a foreign company holding a major stake in it.
However, none from among the Betel leaf seniors has indicated willingness to accept this Ministry.
It is a strange quirk of irony that there are no takers for this Ministry which has to play a major role in the countrys economy,they say.
When this Ministry was offered to a senior purohita holding a key office in the Betel leaf party, pat had come the reply: No. I dont want it. By the way, he had earlier asked for a more important Ministry than the one he isholding now.
The Ministry goes a-begging for want of a willing taker because of the stigma of the deal to be signed with the foreign company,they say.

Most purohitas and Diyawanna members in yahapalanaya appear to be highly disillusioned over their own lot and the showing of the government and some of them have begun giving vent to their feelings even at high level official meetings, they say.

For example, a certain purohita  a partner in yahapalanaya coalition who has always been quite articulate about national issues in particular had at a recent meeting of the top team candidly expressed his disappointment at the governments two and half year  track record. He had told the Top Two at this meeting that they had to accept the reality that they had miserably failed either to fulfill the promises they held out to the people or to put the countrys economy on the right track. 
Now that at least one purohita has given it straight from the shoulder, some of his colleagues on the same wavelength with him hope that it would serve as an eye opener for those in the highest echelons!

If Muslims lose patience country will face dire consequences: EPC member
	
If the Muslims of this country are to lose their patience the country will face dire consequences, Eastern Provincial Council member, Shibly Farooq said.
He said so at the monthly sitting of the of the Eastern Provincial Council.
"The racial activities taking place in the country will pave the way for another blood bath. The majority of the Sinhala community do not approve racism. The proof of this mind set could be seen in the defeat of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.The Tamils and Muslims in the country are once again facing a series of problems.The reasons for this development are the politics and International pressure," the EPC member said.
"Racism is once again unleashed in spite of the fact that the scars of the 1983 blood bath and the war that followed have not healed yet," he said
"Therefore, while great trust has been placed on this government of Good Governance, it must flex its muscles and restrain the racist forces from rearing their ugly heads," Mr.Farook said.

Illegal sand mining gets legal cover
	
Extending beyond the horizons into the forest area of Pachchanor in Kinniya Muthur in the Trincomalee District is a long strip of track, neither carpeted, concreted nor gravelled. Treading along this terrain, through paddy fields battered by natural catastrophes or anthropogenic activities of humans, any tourist would be led to an open area, similar to a desert.
Although this trail appears to be a boulevard due to its width and length extending straight into the forest, it would never be used as a passageway because of its uneven surface with pits where wild elephants may romp in splashing water during rainy days.
This eerie track is however frequented by large trucks running along whirling dusts that veil the trees in the surrounding, tainting their natural green and painting them in brownish colour. Anyone would soon realise that these trucks are used to transport sand mined from the deposits made by the overflowing Mahaweli River during its lifespan of thousands of year.
The fleet of trucks loaded with sand running towards the main road indicates large-scale illegal sand mining carried out on a few licences to give purported legality to a racket. Severity of these mining activities is not known to many and remains unexposed by the media due to the difficulties engaged in gaining access to the location.
However, we underwent a daunting task to gather first-hand information on this concern. When we were close to our destination, we saw a police constable guarding a big mound of sand. Later, we came to know a police guard has been placed there as it was a production of a case relating to illegal sand mining.
We also saw several vigilant men in Welimankada, as it is called by the racketeers and miners, scattered to pass information of imminent threats by relevant authorities. Almost all miners possess mining licences. Yet, one observing their behaviour would ponder about the conditions when they witness indiscriminate mining in any location convenient to them and the rudeness of the machine on the hither to untouched earths disturbing the other sensitive features of the isolated natural surroundings and also the manner in which huge trucks transport the sand through the tender and pristine natural beauties and also disturbing wild animals and birds.
Besides the businessmen involved in these rackets, some mining spots are said to be operated by an officer responsible for enforcing the law, an ASP. It is said that subordinate officers remain quiet about these malpractices of their seniors. About a hundred trucks from various parts of the country arrive at the mining site daily and return with truckloads of sand.
Sand is scooped not only from the Mahaweli bank near the sea, but also from the nearby lagoon. There are huge mounds of sand in a radius of two kilometres from the bridge over the Mahaweli River.
There are several regulations forbidding the use of backhoe machines for mining operations. But it is a common sight to see the hustle and bustle of this heavy machinery operating from within the river itself.
There is also another police officer involved in sand mining. He is known to collect money from other illegal miners as bribes. Yet another police officer has been blamed for soliciting bribes and gaining profits by introducing truck owners to the racketeers.
Earlier, a complaint had been lodged at the Trincomalee Police Headquarters over the unlawful behaviour of police officers.
In one instance, a few police intelligence officers who learnt that a whopping sum of money was offered to the corrupt police officers reported this to the top level, but to no avail. Surprisingly, the unscrupulous cops have got the intelligence officers who brought their fraud to light transferred.
However, two top police officers in the Eastern Province who were engaged in the sand mining racket were transferred. 
Commenting on this, a police officer attached to the police station in Kilinochchi division said: Our superior has a good rapport with racketeers. He lets loose the ones who bribe him and arrests those who fail to do so. Whenever subordinate police officers take illegal miners into custody, they are threatened and abused.Another junior police officer said: The influence of a few police officers who are acquainted with these racketeers has made the duty-conscious officers to stay idle, thereby allowing the racketeers to continue their businesses. People blame us saying we are not taking actions against the illegal sand miners, but the truth is that we are helpless.
Meanwhile, a resident of the area said the main road was being damaged by the trucks that carried heavy loads of sand very frequently.
People say illegal sand miners have the support of two politicians in the area. There are provisions under a number of acts such as the Coast Conservation Act, Forest Conservation Act and National Environment Act to make a tremendous impact on the environment. Also are several government agencies like the Coast Conservation Department, Forest Conservation Department, Central Environment Authority, Geology and Mining Bureau.
The Irrigation Department, Mahaweli Authority and Divisional secretariats are responsible for enforcing the law against illegal sand mining. However, these agencies complain they have not been provided with adequate staff and other facilities to deal with environmental concerns. This situation has further empowered underworld figures.
Today, anthropogenic disasters have occurred countrywide with new strategies being followed by racketeers, often through the loopholes of the existing legal framework.
Thus, it is the Environment Ministry that functions under the purview of President Maithripala Sirisena that should shoulder the total responsibility. We hope the ministerial staff would focus on these concerns and take apt and immediate measures to stop this menace.
Excessive sand mining would spur earthslips in hill country
EnvironmentalistDr. Ravindra Kariyawasam
Mother Earth is the source of all resources needed for peaceful living. Whether it is sand mining or anything else, what we are doing is irritations on this resourceful earth. Each grain of sand takes millions of years to form. By any single minor tapping done on it we are destroying a millennium.
We can construct things, but cannot recreate earth. Because of this intrinsic value, the earth deserves to be protected.
Sand deposits in Trincomalee are a protection ridge formed in an expansion of marshy land. Removal of the ridge will cause further penetration of water to the land causing marshy land to dry -- water retention pools are significant features of the local geology. Hazardous mining is being done around these water pools, causing soil erosion and ultimately earthslips. 
There is also a court order on mining on the banks of Deduru Oya. There is a certain manner in which sand mining should be done.
There is adequate provision in the Sri Lankan legal system regarding the subject matter, but the racketeers dont adhere to them. They also seem to have the blessings of the politicos and the police.
The flood plain of the Mahaweli River, which spans between Welikanda and Trincomalee, is formed with soil being washed away from the interior of the country. This shows how sand mining can cause earthslips in the hill country.

Indian Army says it is firing at Pakistan military posts
	

Hindustan Times, New Delhi, 23.05.2017 - The Indian army said on Tuesday that it is engaging in punitive fire assaults on Pakistani posts that were aiding infiltrators into India. 
Recent actions in Naushera have caused damage to Pakistan army posts, said Maj Gen Ashok Narula in a briefing.  He said the Indian army proactively dominates the LoC. We want peace and tranquillity in Jammu and Kashmir. 
Pakistani army has been providing full support to infiltrators by engaging Indian Army posts, he added. The fire assault follows the beheading of two Indian jawans by militants from Pakistan earlier this month. The army had at the time said that Pakistan will have to face consequences, and promised a response action at a time and place of our choosing.

## Title: Kularatne of Ananda The man and his work

Kularatne of Ananda The man and his work
	
Review of Kamalika Pieris Kularatne of Ananda:The Life and Work of P. de S. Kularatne, published in 2015
Biographers are like method actors, I have always felt: they try to get into the skins of their subjects. I am no biographer, only a writer, but this truism is valid even for the most pedestrian journalist. You have to have empathy for the person youre writing on, regardless of your political preferences and of whether they are aligned with those of that other person. It is hard to be completely objective, but if you have managed to depict the many nuances of that individual, you have achieved your goal. 
I would like to think that Kamalika Pieris biography of P. de S. Kularatne falls into this category of biographies. Like most other national figures from that time, Kularatne was not free of controversy or the vitriol that flows from being controversial. Pieris book does not offer us a complete sketch of the man. Indeed, she seems to have written it as an apology for having ignored him and his worth when he was alive. Such an apologia can be cumbersome and tends to adulate on the person being depicted. It is a measure of Pieris dexterity that she does not deteriorate that way. Not one bit. 
Patrick de Silva Kularatne was born in 1893 in Degoda, Ambalangoda to a Sinhala Buddhist entrepreneurial family. His father was involved in cinnamon, tea and rubber at a village located about seven miles from his hometown. Having educated him at Devananda Vidyalaya in Patabendimulla and later at Dharmasoka College, he sent his son to the leading school in the region back then, Richmond College. 
Like every other national figure who emerged from the South, including C.W.W. Kannangara and A.P. de Zoysa, Kularatne was nurtured in the Wesleyan tradition. The fact that he was a Buddhist did not deter him from excelling in various fields, academic and extracurricular, at a predominantly Christian school: by the time he was transferred to Wesley College in Colombo, he would obtain (inter alia) a First Class in the Cambridge Junior Local examination, with distinctions in arithmetic and mathematics. Mathematics was his strongest subject, English literature his weakest. 
In March 1913, he left Ceylon for University College in London, where he completed two degrees (Mathematics and Law), was called to the Bar, became a Barrister at Law, and realised that the British Civil Service was not considered as important by Englishmen as it was by his countrymen. After travelling around London and Ireland, he received a cable from W.A. de Silva asking him to become Principal of a leading Buddhist school back home. Thrilled, because he had gone to study in England in order to uplift Buddhist education in his country, he returned. 
Kamalikas book has as much to do with Kularatne as it does with that school, Ananda. He was born about seven years after it was started. When he took over from C.V. Ranawake (he would serve two terms: 1918-1932 and 1936-1943), however, he was not too optimistic about his position: It did not act as a great inducement to him, we are told. Nevertheless, by the end of his first term, he had achieved what he had wanted: an elite English education in a Buddhist atmosphere. In six chapters, Kamalika consequently delves into Ananda not just as an educational institution, but as a veritable breeding ground for nationalism. 
Kularatne was less a pioneer than an experimenter. We are told that he did not just aim at a revivalist movement in the schools he administered. We are told of the many carnivals he organised and the many extracurricular activities he helped nurture and better their counterparts in Christian schools. We are told of the many academic achievements that school clinched as well. While six chapters seem too much to dwell on a single institution, Kamalika ensures that her prose entrances us. To a considerable extent, this is rooted in her preference for facts over opinion. 
That is why we are ready to forgive, forget, and move on even as she inserts frill into her prose. She writes at length not only of Ananda, but of the many other schools Kularatne managed through the Buddhist Theosophical Society, an organisation he distanced himself from as the years progressed. The shift in him from educationist to politician, however, was not as successful, though it was almost as prolific. 
Unlike Kannangara, he was critical of the establishment. Unlike A.P. de Zoysa, he was critical of the Marxists. The schools he administered gave us many of those Marxists  from N.M. to Philip to Bernard Soysa  but it is a testament to Kularatnes individuality that he disagreed with their materialistic view of history. That individuality proved his undoing, though: in the run-up to the governments decision to take over both assisted and fee-levying schools, for instance, he backtracked on whether Catholic schools should be taken over. We are told that he had his reasons  he wanted state support for Buddhist schools and to leave the Catholic ones alone  but that did not stop his detractors from calling him a tightrope-walker. 
I have already written of Kamalikas prose. It remains her biggest strength in her book, so much so that Kularatne of Ananda goes beyond biography and proves to be valuable to both the common reader and the historian. Eschewing commentary for reportage, she makes us aware of her intention in her preface: I have included every iota of information which I thought would be useful to a researcher later on. 
But Kularatne of Ananda suffers in certain respects. While I dont doubt the sincerity of her intentions, I feel that Kamalika could or should have delved into the social content of the same Buddhist revivalist movement of which Kularatne was a key figurehead. The debate between theosophy and Buddhism, the emancipation of the Sinhala-speaking bourgeoisie after 1956, and the political rise of the English-speaking, rightwing Buddhist elite who favoured a division between the laity and the clergy, are pertinent for Kamalikas time, Kularatnes time, and our time. 
Why do I say this Malinda Seneviratne, known for his outspoken views on nationalism, made the following observation when I asked him about Colonel Olcotts programme: I believe that his revivalist programme suffered on two counts. Firstly, it separated Sinhala from Buddhist. Secondly, it failed to engage with history and heritage. It is that latter point which interests me, and which I looked for in this book. I couldnt find it, but while I am disappointed I am aware that the authoress is not beholden to her readers: she has set Kularatne up for dissection and praise, and it is Kularatne who drives her narrative. Everything else is peripheral, I concede. 
In the final analysis, Kularatne of Ananda blends in light reading, scholarship, history, and even sociology (though because of its limitations we do not see much of the latter). The fact that it was published two years ago, and has so far failed to generate interest or controversy, reveals where the nationalist project he was part of, in our schools and elsewhere, has taken the common reader to. We should regret, I believe. 
At the cost of generating some controversy myself, I will hence end on this note: if Kularatne aimed at delivering English education in a Buddhist country, he did not succeed completely, not because of a lack of sincerity on his part, but because (as Malinda once wrote) more than half a century of swabasha has left us, not an emboldened nation, but a gandabba one, neither here nor there. Perhaps, Kularatne of Ananda has as much to say in what it contains as it has in what it does not contain.

Man detained after suspected suicide attack kills 22 in Manchester
	

British authorities believe they know the identity of the suicide bomber who killed 22 people including children at a pop concert, Prime Minister Theresa May said on Tuesday, as police said they had arrested a 23-year-old man in connection with the attack.
May said the cowardice of the attacker was met by the bravery of the emergency services and the people of Manchester in remarks given at Downing Street, her London office, following a meeting of the governments emergency committee.
This was among the worst terrorist incidents we have ever experienced in the United Kingdom, she said.
And although it is not the first time Manchester has suffered in this way, it is the worst attack the city has experienced and the worst-ever to hit the north of England.
Greater Manchester Police said they arrested a 23-year-old man suspected of links to the attack, while a second man was detained at the citys Arndale shopping centre but was not currently believed to be connected to last nights attacks.
The shopping centre was briefly evacuated on Tuesday morning,reports said.
May said she planned to visit Manchester on Tuesday, while Andy Burnham, the citys mayor, said a vigil was planned for the victims in Manchesters central Albert Square at 6 pm.
The White House said US President Donald Trump spoke to May by telephone to offer condolences and support on behalf of the United States.

MYTH: Popping a pimple will get rid of it faster 
BUSTED: Normally we dont encourage people to pop their pimples. If the inflammation is mild, the pimple will heal without any scarring. However if the inflammation is severe, there is a tendency to scar and these will be permanent. Handling a pimple on your own can make things worse. You can introduce infection and by trying to forcefully pop it without letting it heal naturally, the scar can become unpleasant, explained Dr. Nayani Madarasinghe, Consultant Dermatologist.

SAARC, BIMSTEC inactive, ineffective: CBK
	
Former Sri Lankan President Chandrika Bandarnaike Kumaratunga has slammed the SAARC and BIMSTEC for not doing anything to solve the regional crises.
Both regional organisations failed to resolve any political problems, she said, delivering a lecture in Dhaka on Tuesday.
I would say (the regional groupings) are inactive and ineffective, she said.
She said during her time as Lankan President at a summit in Maldives she along with the then Maldives President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom slightly changed the language in the founding document of SAARC so that it can discuss bilateral or trilateral issues.<U+200E>
But it has not been able to do anything to the political problems (of any member state).
I would say the same for the BIMSTEC, she said, referring to the grouping that connects South Asia with Southeast Asia and which is being seen as an alternative to SAARC as Pakistan is not a member of that grouping.
The tension in relations between India and Pakistan is seen as a stumbling block for SAARC and its mandate.
The Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies, BIISS, organised the lecture on Reconciling divided societies, building democracy and good governance: Lessons from Sri Lanka.
Kumaratunga, who was president from Nov 1994 to Nov 2005, highlighted different aspects of the Sri Lankas post- civil war reconciliation and peace-building process.
She also discussed her countrys present state of democracy as well as good governance. She stressed the pluralistic, multicultural and diversified society in South Asia and identified terrorism as one of the main challenges in the region.
She identified terrorism as one of the main challenges in South Asia and referring to the Tamil Tigers, she said: I come from a country, which experienced the effects of terrorism for nearly three decades.
She stressed the need for identifying the deep-rooted causes of terrorism.
Officials from different ministries of the government, representatives of different embassies, national and international organisations, former ambassadors and researchers from various institutions participated at the event.
BIISS Chairman Ambassador Munshi Faiz Ahmad and its Director General Maj Gen AKM Abdur Rahman also spoke on the occasion. (bdnews24)

SEC likely to come under Ravi as controversial liquor maker plans going public
	
Capital market regulator, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), is likely to come under the purview of the Foreign Ministry with the appointment for former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake as the countrys External Affairs Minister, the Daily Mirror reliably learns.
This will be in addition to placing several other institutions such as the Development Lotteries Board, National Lotteries Board, Mahapola Scholarship Fund and SriLankan Airlineswhich generally dont come under the Foreign Ministryunder him.
Sources said the move towards placing SEC under Karunanayake comes in the wake of a controversial liquor company making plans to go public on the Colombo Stock Exchange.
Last year, the Excise Department gave approval to this company to set up an alcohol manufactory on instructions from the Department of Fiscal Policy, both of which fell under the purview of the Ministry of Finance then headed by Karunanayake.
The SEC currently falls under the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Sources said Karunanayake would be likely to be made the State Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs in addition to his Cabinet Portfolio as the External Affairs Minster to make way for these institutions to fall under him.
Currently MP Niroshan Perera functions as the State Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs.
Sources said a shake-up in State and Deputy Ministers were also on the cards.

Number One in yahapalanaya attended a special religious ceremony to mark Vesak. The event drew a huge crowd to the city.

It so happened that a flamboyant khaki high-up escorted by a defender vehicle convoy and Police outriders had headed to the venue of the ceremony ahead of Number One whose escort was restricted to only two vehicles. And later the news that Number One while on the way to the important ceremony was held up for several minutes due to the khaki high-ups motorcade blocking the road ahead spread like wildfire.
By the way, this high-up now well-known for his showmanship, is said to be ever on the look-out for something new that would put him in the limelight. He had jaws dropping when he made it mandatory for his subordinates to start the day with a soul-cleansing meditation session. Recently he had assigned four of his aides to the job of posting visuals of his novel projects on Facebook. Meanwhile, another interesting story doing the rounds these days tells how our showman brashly unseated an intelligence officer of the special team assigned for the security of visiting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Nuwara Eliya public rally grabbed the chair for himself

Sunglasses: A Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde tale
	

Our tiny island sitting amidst the Indian Ocean receives strong sunlight all year round and we have had an extra blast of sunlight in the past few months. The human eye, our most treasured asset to vision, in particular is being subjected to harsh damage from the sun. Doctors strongly recommend the usage of sunglasses to minimize the adverse effects on the eye, so no matter what activities you are engaged in, your eyes will be protected and in good health.

We spoke to retired Consultant Eye Surgeon from the Ragama Teaching Hospital Dr. M. Wijetunge regarding the need to wear sunglasses, which type of sunglasses are most suitable for our islanders and last but not least, the good and bad sides of sunglasses. 

What purposes do sunglasses serve
Visible light waves from the sun travel in all directions. When this scattered light meets a horizontal surface (like a road or water), a large portion of light is reflected with horizontal polarization. This is seen as a white glare by the eye and masks the light useful to the human eye and reduces visibility, depth perception, color perception and may temporarily blind you while at the same time causing discomfort to the eye. The glare may also be difficult to look at. The UV light from the sun also harms the eye in ways we do not realize. It may result in cataracts, dry eyes and eye irritability, retina degeneration and building up of extra tissue on the cornea of the eye, which is known as pterigium. Dr. Wijetunge recommends sunglasses to avoid these eye complications. When the naked eye looks at a light source, part of the light rays is reflected and this reduces damage to the light sensing part of the eye, the retina. Wearing sunglasses further reflects 10-20% of the light rays providing more protection to the retina and thereby our eyesight. 


The Dr. Jekyll side of sunglasses
According to Dr. Wijetunge, reducing glare and improving eye safety is the overall function of sunglasses. They reduce eye strain caused by squinting to see better under the sun which results in discomfort and eye health issues such as redness, irritation, fatigue, and headaches. Sunglasses maintain eye comfort and keep the eye well rested. Sunglasses also prove useful in water-related activities such as water sports, fishing and boating. The waters surface reflects everything, obscuring the view of the water. The majority of fishermen in our country suffer from eye cataracts as the glare caused by the reflected light of water is responsible for this. Our fishermen do not use sunglasses. I recommend sunglasses with glare filters. Using sunglasses, especially polarized eye wear, blocks reflection and enables the wearer to see the water with more lucidity and reduces risks of cataracts.

The Mr. Hyde side to sunglasses
As far as I am concerned, sunglasses do more good than harm but the wrong kind of sunglassescould lead to a reversed situation. People opt for cheap types of sunglasses where they do not take the quality into consideration, commented Dr. Wijetunge. A variety of shades are available for purchase and though you may be spoilt for choice and at a loss about the right kind of shades for you, it is of utmost importance to understand that as trivial as it may seem, the tables can turn if the wrong kind of sunglasses are worn. Some sunglasses darken the vision which could lead to reduced eyesight. Some sunglasses harness materials which allow UV light to go through beyond the limit. Side-effects of the wrong kind of sunglasses are experienced if a person wears them on a long term basis. Headaches, tearing and discomfort are some of the side-effects. It is always advisable to use standardized sunglasses he said. Dr. Wijetunge further added that wearing larger sunglasses are practically advised, as opposed to wearing smaller ones. Larger shades cover the entire area of the eye but when smaller shades are worn, UV rays enter the eye through the open areas and cause dilation of the pupil continuously. This is not harmful to the eyes. 
Buying sunglasses is not as easy as it sounds and there are many aspects that must be taken into consideration. Never let expense be your deciding factor in choosing the right kind of shades. Priority must be given to quality because you do not want to make the wrong decision when it comes to vision.

(Daily Mail, London) 23 May 2017 - 
Donald Trump made the short trip from Jerusalem to Bethlehem Tuesday to meet Mahmoud Abbas and pitch a lasting peace with Israel. 
President Abbas assures me he is ready to work towards that goal in good faith, and Prime Minister Netanyahu has promised the same, he announced at the Palestinian Presidential Palace. 

Abbas hopes to convince the unpredictable U.S. president to remain committed to an independent Palestinian state as part of those negotiations. 
I am truly hopeful that America can help Israel and the Palestinians forge peace and bring new hope to the region and its people. I also firmly believe that if Israel and the Palestinians can make peace, it will begin a process of peace all throughout the Middle East, and that would be an amazing accomplishment, he said. 
Abbas offered a similar view before Trump spoke, saying through a translator that our Palestinian peoples attainment of their freedom and independence is key to peace and stability in the world. Abbas reiterated our commitment to cooperate with you in order to make peace and forge a historic peace deal, but referred to East Jerusalem, where Trump was for part of Monday, as occupied territory.

Waiting for the green light
	

A group of front-liners of a main political party recently paid a courtesy call on a onetime party stalwart whose miscalculated somersault saw him in hot water first and in political wilderness soon afterwards..

Diyawanna members from the Central, Wayamba and Western provinces who comprised the group had apprised the former colleague of the issues currently troubling the party and invited him to re-join the party letting bygones be bygone.
The former stalwart had readily accepted the invitation, but the Green light from the party leadership is yet to come, they say.
