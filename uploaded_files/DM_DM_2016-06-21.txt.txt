Bus fares should go up by 5-6 percent: Gemunu
	
Bus fares should go up by five to six percent July 1 onwards, in keeping with the agreement with the National Transport Commission (NTC), Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association (LPBOA) Chairman Gemunu Wijeratne said today.
According to the NTC the bus fare increment for this year was calculated as 3.2 percent, he said.
Bus fare should be increased from five to six percent. The 3.2 percentage increase had come out due to calculation error, he said.
As LPBOA, we do not request 15 per cent increment. Five to six percent increment is bearable for the people in the country, Wijeratne said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Frenchman on trial for abusing 66 boys including Lankans
	
A Frenchman went on trial for paedophilia on Monday, confessing to abusing dozens of young boys in Sri Lanka, Tunisia and Egypt.
Thierry Darantieres voice shook as he expressed regrets which seem futile to these young people I will never see again. The sheer number of his victims  66  makes the trial the biggest in France for sex crimes committed abroad.
Despite the magnitude of the sexual tourism industry, such hearings are rare, given of a lack of evidence and plaintiffs. Darantiere, 53, a former director of a Catholic retirement home, is charged with rape and sexual assault, corrupting minors, using under-age prostitutes, and recording and disseminating child pornography between 2002 and 2011. It was the FBI that first tracked him down, finding dozens of images on the Internet of him abusing young boys in 2011. French police arrested him the following year.
Investigators found thousands of photos and hundreds of videos on hard disks seized from Darantieres home showing him with minors in Tunisia, Egypt and Sri Lanka. They counted 41 victims in Tunisia, 19 in Sri Lanka and six in Egypt. The boys ranged in age from six to 17. Darantiere told investigators he was bisexual with paedophile tendencies, a loner and a sick person who needs help. But he denied forcing the boys to commit sexual acts, saying he paid them with money and gifts. He also denied abusing any children under 13.
In court on Monday, Darantiere sobbed as he told of his upbringing in a devout Catholic family for which homosexuality was unthinkable. He said he had never had intimate relations with an adult in France but invented a wife and child as he took a job as the head of a retirement home in Pecq, west of Paris. While he had no homosexual relations in France, he said young boys solicited sex with him on his travels. I said to myself, How can they talk about it like that' he testified. I told myself, Hey, its possible, you can do it overseas. A psychiatric expert said the defendant did not accept that he was a paedophile. Overseas there are no limits, while France is the place for a conformist existence. (vanguardngr)

Fury of a woman scorned
	

Two Diyawanna members  an Adam and an Eve - are in the habit of breathing fire at each other whenever they come face to face these days.

The root cause for the bad blood between the two is traced to the incident where the fair one was hooted at when she visited an area affected by the flooding of Kelani River recently.
The fair one had been blaming the Diyawanna colleague for being the author of this incident which caused her loss of face.
During a heated exchange, the fair one had accused the male counterpart of staging the boo protest in a bid to defame her and increase his vote base.
Vehemently protesting his innocence, the Diyawanna member had said that he had nothing to do with that incident. What am I to do if people on their own decide to boo at you
She had replied: I have no intention of contesting again. So there is no cause for you to worry about your manape vote any longer.

Gammanpilas arrest: JHU rejects allegations
	
While rejecting the allegations that Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) was behind the arrest of UPFA MP Udaya Gammanpila, JHU national organizer Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said today such allegations were being made to suppress the financial crime allegations levelled against Mr. Gammanpila.
Mr. Warnasinghe said there was no politics involved in his (Gammanpila's) arrest and added that he was arrested following a complaint made by his business partners in connection with the financial crimes allegedly committed by him.
He said they, as a party, were ashamed and regretted to have been deceived by Mr. Gammanpila, who deceived his own friends.
Mr. Gammanpilas friends had told us that he was a bankrupted businessman when he joined Sihala Urumaya in 2000 but we did not know that he was someone who committed financial frauds like this.
His friends say that this is not the first time he was in prison but he had been in prison for several occasions in the past for similar charges, Mr. Warnasinghe said.
He said certain people including Joint Opposition MPs were trying to show that there were political matters behind Mr. Gammanpilas arrest and that it was a political witch-hunt in a move to prevent the legal process against him and added that legal action should be instituted against anyone irrespective of him being a local or international fraudster, if he had committed any crime, fraud or cheating.
He has been arrested after a complaint made by his business partners against him over a financial crime committed by him 19 years ago. Sydney Jayasinghe has also been arrested over the same issue but no one talks about his arrest, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Govt. to set up Office of Missing Persons
	
The mandate of the three-member Commission appointed by former president Mahinda Rajapaksa in August 2003 to investigate and report on missing persons will end on July 15 and will be replaced by the proposed Office of Missing Persons (OMP), Eastern Province Governor Austin Fernando said.

He said the OMP would be a permanent body and the reverent Act would be presented in Parliament next month.
The Government has decided to set up the OMP, which will take over the functions of the Commission on Missing Persons and continue inquiries on tracing them, Mr. Fernando said.
The Cabinet has approved the proposal made by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for the setting up of an office to deal with all issues relating to missing persons -- the submitting of recommendations, protecting the rights of missing persons and their relatives and identify the channels for the obtaining of relief. The OMP will also maintain a data base collected public and state sector institutions on missing persons.
In a resolution approved in 2013, the UNHRC urged the government to establish a credible mechanism to address alleged violations of the International Humanitarian Law during the final phase of the armed conflict.
There are complaints of people gone missing with their whereabouts unknown during the armed conflict or during political or civil unrest or civil disturbances which are termed as enforced disappearances in the International Convention on Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances, Mr. Wickremesinghe said in his Cabinet memo."Providing information on missing persons is essential. Once the truth is ascertained, it will pave the way for closure, reparations and support."
The OMP is also tasked to collate data relating to missing persons obtained by processes presently being carried out or which were previously carried out, by other institutions, organizations, government departments and commissions of inquiry.
The Members and Chairman of the OMP should be appointed by the President, on the recommendation of the Constitutional Council. It is further proposed that its mandate should extend to missing persons notwithstanding the time period in which such person went missing.
The OMP should have sufficient administrative and investigative powers, including those granted to Commissions of Inquiry, with the power to compel the cooperation of persons and state institutions and officers in the course of its investigations.
While the OMP will not engage in prosecutions, it should be vested with investigative powers to be exercised for the purpose of clarifying the fate of the missing person and the circumstances related to the disappearance. It should also create public awareness with regard to the incidence of missing persons, and make appropriate recommendations, including recommendations with regard to necessary institutional, structural, administrative and legal reform. The findings of the OMP will not give rise to civil or criminal liability. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Though the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had decided to step down because of criticisms, Sri Lankan Central Bank (CB) Governor continues to hold on to his post, amidst severe allegations and criticisms, the Joint Opposition charged today.
UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardane said Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan stepped down due to criticisms over his fiscal management, higher rates of loan interests, economic stability and inflation, followed by bad loans.
But in here, Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran is accused of day light robbery in the Central Bank. Not once but twice. The repercussions of these transactions are severe, which will result in a financial crisis. The Central Bank obtained Rs. 29 billion in March this year for a higher rate of 14. 23%. Even the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had warned about the high rates of interest. Moodys had also ranked Sri Lankas economic outlook as negative, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

There is a State purohita with a difference. When most State rank ones are unhappy that no worthwhile powers have been delegated to them, this one is happily telling all and sundry: Once I was a member of the top team. I was like a peon those days. Although I am functioning at State level now, I have been entrusted with responsible powers and functions.


This State purohita while recounting his woes of the past would also refer to a kinsman of the former Lokka whom he had reason to fear.
However, members and purohitas hailing from the same district the State one comes from say that the latter was an intimate of the former strongman. Now this worthy is disowning the former Lokka and his kinsmen in a bid to warm his way into graces of the powers that be, they add.

The Sri Lanka Army yesterday said the Army Commander had appointed two Courts of Inquiry (COl) to ascertain the whereabouts of the missing documents pertaining to Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickramathungas murder and Prageeth Eknaligoda case.
They said the Army Commander, reassuring the Armys assistance to the CID investigations, had detailed the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) of the Sri Lanka Military Police to trace various documents that had been requested by the CID, but certain requested documents, could not be retrieved by the SIU.
Hence, the Army commander appointed the two COIs to ascertain the whereabouts of the missing documents and if the documents are indeed missing, the period they had gone missing and the persons responsible for them.
Issuing a media statement, they said the findings of the Courts of Inquiry would be intimated to the Courts and the CID at the conclusion of the said inquires.
The Army denied media reports alleging that the Army was not cooperating with the CID detectives, investigating into late Wickramathungas murder and reiterated its utmost commitment to the Rule of Law.
If any member of the Army is found to be involved in the two cases aforesaid directly or indirectly including obstructing justice by suppressing of evidence, such persons will be brought before a Court martial irrespective of their ranks or stature, the statement said.

Vaiko flays naming of stadium after ex-Jaffna mayor
	
MDMK general secretary Vaiko on Monday alleged that by naming a renovated stadium in Sri Lanka after Alfred Duraiappah, former mayor of Jaffna, the governments in India and Sri Lanka had sought to deceive the world that normalcy had returned to the country, the Hindu reported today.
In a statement, he said when there was no trace of thousands of Tamils who had disappeared during the war and when thousands of them continued to live in camps, PM Narendra Modi had inaugurated the stadium through video conferencing.
This is nothing but an attempt to permanently bury fathom deep over 1.87 lakh Tamils killed by the Sri Lankan Army. He said Duraiyappah was a traitor and responsible for the death of Tamils in police firing and electrocution at the venue of World Tamil Conference in 1974.
