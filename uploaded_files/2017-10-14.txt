Abolishing  J.R. Jayewardene?s Executive Presidency
	
Reputed American Writer and Humourist Samuel Clemens, known to the world as Mark Twain was in London in May 1897 on a lecture tour. A rumour began circulating in the USA that Mark Twain was gravely ill and on the verge of death. Subsequently another rumour began spreading in the US of Mark Twain passing?away in the UK.?
On May 28th, 1897 the editors of the ?New York Journal? cabled their London Correspondent Frank Marshall White to contact the creator of Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer and get Mark Twain?s reaction to reports about the author being in his deathbed in England.
Frank Marshall White relayed the request of his editors to Mark Twain who readily obliged. On May 31st 1897 Twain wrote down his response and sent it to the journalist. Frank Marshall White?s article about Mark Twain?s health appeared in the ?New York Journal? of June 2nd 1897. A relevant excerpt?
stated as follows -
?Mark Twain was undecided whether to be more amused or annoyed when a Journal representative informed him today of the report in New York that he was dying in poverty in London................ The great humorist, while not perhaps very robust, is in the best of health. He said: ?I can understand perfectly how the report of my illness got about, I have even heard on good authority that I was dead. James Ross Clemens, a cousin of mine, was seriously ill two or three weeks ago in London, but is well now. The report of my illness grew out of his illness.
The report of my death was an exaggeration.?
The response of Mark Twain that the report of his death was an exaggeration became quite famous over the years. The passage of time led to the original wording being somewhat embellished. Two popular versions of Mark Twain?s responses are ? The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated? and ?Reports of my death are grossly exaggerated?. Both lines attributed to Mark Twain have been ?greatly or grossly? quoted and cited by many?in their writings.
The lines about the exaggerated reports of Mark Twain?s death often come to mind in the context of Sri Lanka?s executive presidency. There have been many reports in the past that the executive presidency was going to be abolished.?
?
?A strong executive seated in power for a fixed number of years, not subject to the whims and fancies of an elected legislature; not afraid to take correct but unpopular decisions because of censure....
?
?
There have been many assurances by political leaders that the executive presidency would be done away with. There have been some attempts also in that direction. None has succeeded so far. All reports of the executive presidency being abolished have been ?greatly?exaggerated? so far.
?
Junius Richard Jayewardene
The much maligned executive presidency was established by the United National Party (UNP) Govt. of Junius Richard Jayewardene in 1978. Today in an ironic twist of fate, the UNP headed by JR?s nephew Ranil Wickremesinghe wants to abolish the very same executive presidency. Ranil Wickremesinghe first elected to Parliament in 1977 was himself part of the UNP Govt. which demolished the prevailing Westminster parliamentary system and introduced the Presidential form of Government.
The Presidential system introduced by J.R. Jayewardene has a long history. When JR was Minister of State in the UNP Government of Dudley Senanayake (1965-70) he made a ground-breaking speech at the Association for the Advancement of Science. JR Jayewardene in his keynote address of December 14, 1966 outlined his vision for an executive presidency and argued in favour of a Presidential system based on the US and French models.
?The executive will be chosen directly by the people and is not dependent on the legislature during its period of existence, for a specified number of years. Such an executive is a strong executive seated in power for a fixed number of years, not subject to the whims and fancies of an elected legislature; not afraid to take correct but unpopular decisions because of censure from its parliamentary party,? he said.
JR?s advocacy of an executive presidency sent shock waves down the political establishment when it was made. Relations between Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake and State Minister JR Jayewardene had deteriorated at that time. Dudley was firmly opposed to the idea. There were few takers for JR?s proposal even within the United National Party (UNP). In that environment JR was unable to push his proposal further but he never let go of his vision.
The next chance came six years later during the United Front (UF) Government of Sirimavo Bandaranaike (1970-77). Parliament had converted itself into a Constituent Assembly to draft a new Constitution. JR was then the Leader of the Opposition while Dudley Senanayake remained leader of the UNP. Differences between both had escalated and JR was almost a ?lone wolf? within the party?
at that time.
On July 2, 1971, JR moved a resolution in the Constituent Assembly. It read as follows: ?The executive power of the State shall be vested in the President of the Republic, who shall exercise it in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. The President of the Republic shall be elected for seven years for one term only by the direct vote of every citizen over 18 years of age. The President of the Republic shall preside over the council of ministers?. JR?s motion was seconded at the Constituent Assembly by Ranasinghe Premadasa who was then the Colombo Central MP and Chief Opposition Whip.
?
JR - Premadasa Motion
JR argued eloquently, within the Constituent Assembly, in support of an executive presidency. The motion was shot down. Constitutional Affairs Minister Dr. Colvin R de Silva led the Government onslaught against JR?s proposal. Even a majority of UNP parliamentarians were not supportive because party leader Dudley Senanayake himself was firmly opposed to the idea. The JR-Premadasa motion was rejected by the then Constituent Assembly.
The UF Government brought in the new Republican Constitution on May 22, 1972. The Governor General under the Soulbury Constitution gave way to the President. As a result Power was vested in Parliament known then as the National State Assembly and while President William Gopallawa was the titular Head of State, the real power was retained by Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike.
Dudley Senanayake passed away in 1973 and JR succeeded him as UNP leader. He soon established his leadership position and brought the party under his full control. JR was now able to pursue his vision of an executive presidency from a strong position.
The UNP manifesto of 1977 stated, ?Executive power will be vested in a President elected from time to time by the people. The Constitution will also preserve the parliamentary system we are used to and the Prime Minister will be chosen by the President from the party that commands a majority in Parliament and the ministers of the cabinet would also be elected members of Parliament.? The change to an Executive President from Prime Ministerial system was a key aspect of the UNP electoral campaign in 1977. The UNP swept the polls and obtained 141 out of the 168 parliamentary seats. JR Jayewardene became Prime Minister in July 1977. He began moving fast towards his cherished vision of an executive presidency.
JR and a small group of ministers and party stalwarts (including JR?s brother HW Jayewardene Q.C.) in association with leading lawyer Mark Fernando started working towards the goal of introducing the executive presidency. The preliminary discussion was on August 7, 1977. An amendment to the Republican Constitution of 1972 was first drafted. After discussions in Cabinet it was approved and certified by the Cabinet as ?urgent in the?national interest?.
?
?
Second Amendment
Thereafter it was sent by the Speaker to the Constitutional Court which prevailed at that time, as an ?urgent bill?. The Constitutional Court approved the bill within 24 hours as stipulated. It was then presented to the National State Assembly for debating and voting. The bill was adopted by the then National State Assembly on September 22, 1977 as the Second Amendment to the 1972 Republican constitution . Executive power was transferred to the President and JR Jayewardene became the first Executive President of Sri Lanka on Independence Day, February 4, 1978.
Meanwhile JR was also working towards the goal of replacing the 1972 Constitution in its entirety with a new one. On October 20, 1977 the National State Assembly passed a resolution enabling the then Speaker Anandatissa de Alwis to appoint a Select Committee for Constitutional Reform. The essence of the select committee mandate was, ?To consider the revision of the Constitution of the Republic of Sri Lanka and other written law as the committee may?consider necessary.?
The Parliamentary select committee was announced on November 3, 1977. Initially the chairman was JR Jayewardene who was then representing Colombo West in Parliament. JR however had to vacate Parliament as an MP in February 1978 after he was sworn in as President. Ranasinghe Premadasa who was also serving in the select committee was then appointed chairman on February 23, 1978 by the Speaker. Mr. Premadasa was also appointed Prime Minister.
Other MP?s from the UNP in the select committee were Gamini Dissanayake, Lalith Athulathmudali, Ronnie de Mel, K.W. Devanayagam and M.H.M. Naina Marikkar. Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) MPs appointed to the committee were Sirimavo Bandaranaike and Maithripala Senanayake. Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC) Leader Saumiyamoorthy Thondaman who had not joined the Government in 1977 was also on the committee. The Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) which at the time was the main opposition party refused to serve on the committee.?
?
The change to an Executive President from Prime Ministerial system was a key aspect of the UNP electoral campaign in 1977. The UNP swept the polls and obtained 141 out of the 168 parliamentary seats...?
?
?
As a result of the left parties being wiped out in the 1977 poll, there were neither Trotskyites nor Communists in the committee. In May 1978 the two SLFP representatives withdrew from the select committee.
?
Head of State and Govt.
The executive presidency ushered in through the earlier second amendment was now streamlined and incorporated in the new draft constitution. The executive President was now Head of State and Head of Government. The electoral system was also changed from the first- pass-the post system to that of the proportional representation system. The republic of Sri Lanka became the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.
The new Constitution referred to popularly as the ?JR constitution? was formally promulgated on September 7, 1978. With the enthronement of the executive presidency , Sri Lanka?s political system changed from the British Westminster model to that of one closely resembling the French Gaullist Constitution.?
?
The TNA has been collaborating extensively with the UNP led Govt. in the constitution making exercise. The TNA has made its distinct position known in a nine point addendum. There is no mention of the executive presidency?
?
?
Power shifted to the President who was transformed from a figurehead to an effective Head of State. The post of Prime Minister was devalued in the process.
The executive presidency has been in existence for nearly 40 years now. The Presidential system came in for much criticism from the time of its inception. The blame for almost everything that has gone wrong in Sri Lanka has been laid at the door of JR?s executive presidency. It became the politically correct fashion of the day to condemn the executive presidency as the root of all evil in the Island. From the time of the revolt led by Gamini Dissanayake and Lalith Athulathmudali against former President Ranasinghe Premadasa in 1991 , Sri Lankan political discourse was permeated with strident demands for the abolition of the executive presidency.
?
Broken Promises
The first Sinhala ?talkie? film to be made was released in 1947. The title of the film was ?Kadawunu Poronduwa? meaning Broken Promise. What the Sri Lankan people have been seeing for nearly 25 years is a long line of broken promises as far as the promise to abolish the executive presidency is concerned. What the country has been witnessing is the spectacle of Presidential candidates pledging to abolish the executive presidency during elections and not fulfilling their promises after being elected. Only President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe tried to reduce Presidential powers to some extent by way of the 19th constitutional amendment. Despite demands for its extinction the executive presidency has been enjoying a longevity in political terms. As in the case of Mark Twain?s ?death? , reports of the demise of the executive presidency in Sri Lanka have been vastly exaggerated.
Various Governments have come and gone. Different Presidents have come and gone. But the executive presidency goes on and on. The chief reason for this is the inability or unwillingness of political parties in general and the two main parties in particular to arrive at a consensus on abolishing the executive presidency. The executive presidency can be abolished or downsized only through a constitutional amendment or a new constitution. This requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament and endorsement by the people at a referendum. The regimes commanding a two-thirds majority in Parliament did not want to do away with the presidency. The regimes wanting to eliminate the executive presidency did not have a two-thirds majority. Where there was power there was no will. Where there was will there was no power. Hence a consensus of key political parties on abolishing the executive presidency remains as elusive as ever.
This seems to be the case in the on - going attempt to enact a new constitution too. The Sirisena - Wickremesinghe Govt. converted Parliament into a Constitutional Assembly to draft a new Constitution. A 21 member steering committee was set up. The steering committee interim report was released on Sep 21st 2017. Superficially the interim report is a consensus document. However the reservations on some issues expressed by political parties have been attached to the report as?observations and comments by Members of the Steering Committee on the principles and formulations contained in the Report. These differing viewpoints indicate a divergence of opinion on key issues. This is particularly so in the case of the executive presidency abolition issue.
The steering committee interim report states ; ?There was general consensus that the Executive Presidency as it exists today, be abolished?. It goes on to say ?The President should be conferred with powers, including those in relation to Provincial Councils in specified situations?. The report also says ? The President should be elected by Parliament for a fixed term of office?.
?
Premier Wickremesinghe
The UNP in keeping with Premier Wickremesinghe?s directions has not made any specific observations or suggestions to the interim report. This indicates that the UNP is for the abolition of the executive presidency in its present form. It wants the current powers of the presidency to be reduced drastically and limited to specific functions only. The UNP is also supportive of the whittled down President being elected by the parliament instead of direct election by the whole country as at present.
The Tamil National Alliance(TNA) has been collaborating extensively with the UNP led Govt. in the constitution making exercise. The TNA has made its distinct position known in a nine point addendum. There is no mention of the executive presidency in these. As such it must be concluded that the TNA also is of the same position as that of the UNP in relation to abolishing the executive presidency in its present form. However it must be noted that the TNA has also said it would adhere to the provisions in the interim report if the two main parties - UNP and SLFP - agreed to the same.
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) or the SLFP entity headed by President Maithripala Sirisena has a totally opposite position to that of the UNP, its governing partner , on the executive presidency. The Maithri-led SLFP wants to retain the executive presidency. This position could not have been taken without the consent and approval of Maithripala Sirisena himself. This essentially means that Maithripala Sirisena wants to retain the executive presidency and probably contest a Presidential poll again. It appears that Maithripala who stated that he would not contest for President a second time has now changed his mind and wants the executive presidency to be retained. The SLFP position on the executive presidency as attached to the Interim report is as follows -
?
Opinion of SLFP
?The opinion of the SLFP is that complete abolition of the Executive Presidency, which is present today is not prudent. Considering various terrorist and extremist activities that happen in various countries in the world, the SLFP believes a President should be elected directly from the public mandate with a certain amount of powers to protect the unitary status of the country and to keep and to protect the stability of the country specially in a situation where a large volume of power is granted to the Provincial Councils. Thereby every ethnic group of the country without narrow ethnic, religious problems gets a political power by selecting a President and gets the opportunity to become a member of the Presidential election process, and hence, it becomes a practical method for national reconciliation?. ?The President that is elected in that manner shall be the Head of the Cabinet of
Ministers, and it shall be ensured that he has the opportunity to hold the ministerial
portfolios relating to national security, the three armed forces, and Police. The fact contained in Section 10 of the draft, i.e., the concept that Parliament shall not be dissolved within the first four and a half years except on specific situations, can be agreed upon, but under what specific situations the Parliament can be dissolved during this period need to be discussed further?.
?However, the Constitution shall be formulated in a manner that the concept that the country shall always be ruled by a Government of which the majority consists of representatives of the people is implemented, and the opportunity for democratically ousting a Government is given to the representatives of the people?.
If this is the position of the Maithripala Sirisena led ?De Jure? SLFP then the Mahinda Rajapaksa led ?De Facto? SLFP or group of MP?s known as the ?Joint Opposition ? (JO) can hardly be different. However the JO position on the executive presidency has been non - committal at present. In the observations made by the Steering committee JO representatives Dinesh Gunawardena and Prasanna Ranathunga to the interim report the reference to the executive presidency is ?The proposed wordings presented pertaining to these matters shall be reviewed?.
This indicates that the Mahinda led SLFP may keep its options open on the executive presidency issue. Currently Mahinda Rajapaksa is debarred from contesting the Presidential elections in terms of the 19th constitutional amendment. So the abolition of the executive presidency enables Mahinda to be top dog again if he becomes Prime Minister. Hence he may opt to abolish the executive presidency. However there are two factors to be taken into account. Firstly Mahinda cannot afford to deviate sharply from the line taken by Maithripala Sirisena on the executive presidency at present. Secondly there is a rising tide of support among Mahinda?s grassroots supporters for the preservation of the executive presidency. Mahinda cannot go against them. Thus both factions of the SLFP are very likely to be ?united? in seeking the retention of the executive presidency.
?
Jathika Hela Urumaya
The Jathika Hela Urumaya(JHU) another constituent of the present Govt. also differs strongly against the interim report provisions on the executive presidency. The JHU wants the executive presidency to be retained as a ?democratized? Presidential system.. In fact the JHU has made a very powerful case in support of the executive presidency. It is a position which may very well resonate with substantial sections of the JHU?s Sinhalese Buddhist constituency. The Jathika Hela Urumaya position on the executive presidency is as follows -
?The Westminster system as well as the mixed Presidential system existed in Sri Lanka till 1978 and 1987 respectively before the Provincial Councils were established. The issue regarding the impact the Provincial Councils have on the Sri Lankan constitution when the 13th amendment to the constitution was introduced was addressed by emphasizing the central importance of the Executive Presidency in relation to the unitary nature of the State. Therefore, it is obvious that the existence of a Presidency with a genuine power is essential for the Provincial Councils to prevail intact. Although as a party we are against the Provincial Council system, we recognize its existence since it is a part of the present Constitution. However, if the Provincial Council system exists in such a manner then it is compulsory to have a Presidency with a genuine power. If not, there is a risk of integration and the stability of the State being damaged?.
?
Four parties representing the Muslims, Up Country Tamils and Sri Lankan Tamils of Sri Lanka submitted jointly an addendum to the Interim Report...Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC), the All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC), the Tamil Progressive Alliance(TPA) and the Eelam Peoples Democratic Party(EPDP). ...
?
?
?The view among certain leftist groups that the Parliamentary system in itself is democratic and the Presidency in itself is non-democratic is baseless. The Parliamentary, Presidency and Semi-Presidency systems exist in United Kingdom,
United States and France respectively and all those countries are democratic in a same manner. Therefore, attempting to establish democracy by abolishing the Presidency and by creating the Parliamentary system is meaningless?.
?All the things presented as grievances by the minor communities particularly by the Tamil people, surfaced not during the time the Presidential system was in effect but when the Parliamentary system was effective.?
?Similarly, unlike in the Parliamentary system in the Presidential system, the minorities will have much opportunity to participate when electing the Executive. The capacity of the Presidential system to safeguard the stability of the State expected by the majority of the people is relatively high. Therefore, it can be stated that the Presidential system fulfils the expectations of the majority and the minority at the same time.?
?Therefore, the most logical approach regarding co-existence is that the Presidential system should prevail further. The Presidency which was created from the 1978 constitution had become non-democratic not due to an inherent defect in the Presidency, but because of the nature it was established under the constitution. That mistake was corrected to a considerable extent from the 19th amendment to the constitution. Such reforms can be done if required, Therefore, it is the view of the Jathika Hela Urumaya that a democratized Presidential system should prevail?.
?
Mano Ganesan
The JHU assertion that the executive presidency is beneficial to the minority communities of Sri Lanka does have a certain degree of validity. Political parties representing minority community interests generally favour a directly elected President in an island wide election. This is because the minorities scattered in the seven southern provinces can have a comparatively greater say in electing a President. The Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) leader and National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages Minister Mano Ganesan told this column ?We are in favour of an executive presidency that is elected directly by the people. It would provide minorities more space for political bargaining. However the Presidential powers shall be what were prescribed in the original draft of the 19th amendment. It is low powered presidency but directly elected by the people?.
Four parties representing the Muslims, Up Country Tamils and Sri Lankan Tamils of Sri Lanka submitted jointly an addendum to the Interim report. The parties concerned were the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC), the All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC), the Tamil Progressive Alliance(TPA) and the Eelam Peoples Democratic Party(EPDP). According to the proposals submitted by the SLMC -ACMC -TPA-EPDP quartet the President will be the Head of State and Head of Government. The President is to be elected by the people directly at a Presidential election. The President?s term of office shall be five years and Presidential polls would be on a fixed date. The powers of the President shall be reduced to the levels originally envisaged in the 19th Constitutional amendment and be made answerable to parliament. The President would be the minister of defence and not hold any other cabinet portfolio.
The four parties also want three vice-Presidents from different communities to be appointed. The three vice-Presidents will be from ethnic communities different to that of the community to which the President belongs. Since the chances of a Sinhalese not being elected President are quite remote the three vice -Presidents will be from the Sri Lankan Tamils, the Muslims and the ?Malaiahath Thamilar?(Up Country Tamils).
?
Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna
The Sri Lankan left or what is left of the left too is somewhat aligned on the question of the executive presidency. The JVP wants the executive presidency abolished The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) in its addendum says ? The Executive Presidency shall be completely abolished. However an Executive Prime Minister shall not be created in lieu of the position of the Executive President?.
Dr. Jayampathy Wickramaratne who could be described as a co-architect of the steering committee interim report has also submitted an addendum.
In the addendum Wickramaratne says ? I wish to add my own comments on the matters covered by the Interim Report. The views expressed herein are also the views of the United Left Front and the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (Majority Group), He then goes on to express his views on the executive presidency. Dr. Wickramaratne then outlines his position ?I am for the abolition of the Executive Presidential system of Government. The President should be elected by an Electoral College consisting of Members of Parliament and the Second Chamber. While the President should ordinarily act on the advice of the Prime Minister, I have no objection to the President exercising certain powers after consulting the Prime Minister?.
These then are the differing viewpoints of different political parties on the executive presidency. Judging by the depth and breadth of these differences one wonders whether any sort of consensus could be achieved on the future of the Presidential system of governance. Interestingly enough we have a peculiar and seemingly paradoxical situation where the UNP which introduced the executive presidency wanting to abolish it and the SLFP which opposed it vigorously for years now wanting to retain it. Against that backdrop one cannot but help wonder whether JR Jayewardene?s executive presidency will ever be abolished at all.

Controversial ?Super Prison? opens on Monday
	
The country?s first prison facility built in line with international standards at Angunukolapelessa, Hambantota is to be declared open on Monday.
The prison which is known as the ?Super Prison? among the public due to its luxury features made headlines in view of its special features.
The prison facility which was built at an estimated cost of Rupees 9.5 billion on a 65-hectare land was to be opened with the participation of President Maithripala Sirisena on March 16 this year but was postponed as the President had later declined the invitation.
The new complex will house the inmates of the Tangalle Prison which is in poor condition and is capable of sheltering about 1,500 inmates.
The prison complex would be declared open by Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorale and the Prison Reforms Minister D.M.Swaminathan with the participation of officials of the Department of Prisons. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

EC to check whether foreigners can hold party office
	
The Elections Commission said yesterday it would take up for consideration the argument that foreign passport holders should not become office bearers of any political party in Sri Lanka.
The dispute arose after National Democratic Party (NDF) secretary Shalila Moonesinghe, a foreign citizenship holder and the chairman of Litro Gas Ltd. was arrested and remanded in connection with a financial crime.
EC member Prof. Ratnajeewan Hoole told Daily Mirror but there was little or nothing the Commission could do because the NDF was registered as a political party under the relevant Act.
?Parliament makes the laws. We have no way to alter them,? he said and added that the law did not bar a foreign national from becoming an office bearer.
?A foreigner cannot contest a parliamentary election as set out in the law. However, there is no way to bar a foreigner with a resident visa from contesting the provincial council elections. I think, such an eventuality was not foreseen at the time the law was formulated,? Prof. Hoole said.
The then common opposition candidate Maithripala Sirisena contested the 2015 presidential election under the swan symbol of the NDF and elected President. (Kelum Bandara)

Flood relief moving at snail's pace: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday hit out at public servants in areas which were hit by floods in May this year for not carrying out the relief work and asked them to resign if they were unable to carry out their duties properly.
He said this at a flood relief review meeting held in Morawaka.
?Please resign if you can't work so that we can inform the President and appoint new people and get the work done,? he said while giving them a November 2017 deadline.
?The UNP government of 2003 was able to complete relief work in three months after the floods that year, but the work is moving slowly this year. We might have to airdrop relief money using helicopters if delays continue,? the Prime Minister said.
He said none of the compensation applications received from SMEs in Matara District have been processed as at October 13, 2017.
The National Insurance Trust Fund was blamed for the delay because the district secretaries said they had completed clearance work.
The Prime Minister was visibly upset when he heard that the Peoples Bank and National Savings Bank Chairmen were not present at the meeting and asked them to come and meet him as soon as possible.
It was revealed that the reconstruction of damaged bridges had not begun in any of the affected districts while work on renovating and repairing to affected schools in the Galle District had also not got off the ground and that Asian Development Bank funds remaining unused would have to be returned if they were not made us of before December 31, 2017.
The Prime Minister was told that Southern Provincial Council had not allowed the central government officers to carry out relief work and on hearing this the Prime Minister said he would take up this matter with the Provincial Governor.
?The Governor reports directly to the President and therefore the PC has to work with the central government,? he said.
Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake said all institutions should work together. ?Go out of your comfort zones and help the helpless,? he said while highlighting that most of the government officers are reluctant to go out of their comfort zones.
Home Affairs Minsiter Vajira Abaywardene said state officers would have to take the blame for the delay. He said they must not palm of the responsibility to the political leadership. (Yohan Perera in Morawaka)

Local Council Secretaries: Questions over tour to Japan
	
Some local council secretaries and some State officials are to visit Japan next week amid objections raised by some officials of the Central Provincial Council and the Department of Local Government over the manner in which the secretaries were selected for this tour.
Despite the announcement that half the cost of this tour will be met by a company in Japan handling garbage recycling it is now apparent that the cost of travelling would have to be met from public funds of the respective local councils. The officials selected for this tour are from Kundasale, Patha Dumbara and Poojapitiya Pradeshiya Sabahs.
A senior officer of the Central Province said the procedure in obtaining prior approval from the authorities including the Treasury had not been followed in this regard and as such the Central Provincial Council Secretary had instructed the authorities concerned to cancel the proposed tour to Japan.
When contacted the CPC Commissioner Menaka Herath said this tour had been organized prior to his assuming office and tour to Japan using public funds cannot be allowed under any circumstances. (J A L Jayasinghe)

'Millions kept on Palisena?s chair after encashing cheques'
	
Senior Dealer of PTL Kaushitha Rathnaveera yesterday told the PCoI that he had encashed cheques received by PTL from its related companies on several times amounting millions and left the money on PTL CEO Kasun Palisena?s chair but does not know what happened to the money thereafter.
At the onset of the yesterday?s proceedings, President?s Counsel Kalinga Indatissa appearing on behalf of Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) cross-examined the PTL Chief Dealer Nuwan Salgado on the ?document? he is said to have maintained on the instructions of PTL CEO Kasun Palisena.
Earlier, Nuwan Salgado said that he had maintained a document, which contained payments allocated by PTL to ?informants? coded as ?Charlie?, ?Tango? and ?Car? channeled through its related group companies on the instructions of PTL CEO Kasun Palisena.
Counsel Indatissa first contested the authenticity of the said document and said that the witness was only given the hard copy of the document by the Police officers who interrogated him at the Commission premises. He said the witness was not present when the extraction of that data from the said PTL computer was done by the investigators.
The President?s Counsel said that the witness had sworn in the affidavit dated October 3, 2017 about the said document he maintained, but the PTL?s computers were taken into custody by the CID on October 9, 2017.
He questioned the credibility of the document saying that it cannot be proven in the absence of the original soft copy, which is not available at the moment.
This document maintained by Nuwan Salgado has several columns which reflect fund transfers from PTL to its related group companies (Perpetual Asset Management, W.M. Mendis & Company and Perpetual Capital Holdings).
It was revealed that this document maintained on the instructions of PTL CEO Kasun Palisena was only regarding a few fund transfers which were reflected as payments in the document.
The witness said that he was instructed by his CEO Palisena to add a column on the right hand side of the document under the category of ?informant? and include the names ?Charlie?, ?Tango?, ?Car? and ?CP Interests? relating to those specific payments.
Earlier, when questioned, the witness was of the view that he was unaware as to who were referred to as ?Tango? and ?Car? in the document. But he said that in the dealing room of PTL, the dealers had referred to the Primary Contact person of the EPF as ?Charlie.?
Submitting several documents before the Commission, Mr. Indatissa contested on the payments reflected as ?Car? and ?CP Interests?.
He said ?Car? in the document was not an individual, in fact it was about a vehicle purchase of PTL. Mr. Indatissa said that this vehicle was subsequently used by PTL?s former CEO, Arjun Aloysius.
Mr. Indatissa PC also pointed out that the name mentioned as ?CP Interests? were payments made to the Safe Holdings company as borrowing interests and was not about an individual.
Mr. Indatissa was of the view that the fund transfers (payments) cited in the document were reflected in the CBSL system as well, since they were based on some bond transactions.
The President?s Counsel also suggested that the witness had been forced to give such evidence as there is an action filed in Fort Magistrate?s Court against four suspects including the witness for fabricating evidence.
During the cross-examination, the witness said that he did not see these payments being received by any of third party. Mr. Indatissa therefore said that the witness is not in a position to say that PTL paid third parties any ?gratitudes? based on the said ?document? maintained by Nuwan Salgado.
Counsel Harsha Nanayakkara who was appearing on behalf of former EPF dealer Saman Kumara also cross-examined the witness and said that the document is reflecting a time period between July 2014 to March 2015 but his client was appointed as the EPF dealer in October 2015.
The witness said that he is not hundred percent sure that the name depicted as ?Charlie? in the document, was the same Charlie that they used to refer in the dealing room. However, he said if so, during July 2014 to September 2015, the EPF primary contact person was ?Udayaseelan? and thereafter they called Saman Kumara ?Charlie? as well.
When questioned by President?s Counsel Anuja Premaratne who was appearing on behalf of Arjun Aloysius and W.M.Mendis & Company, the witness was of the view that he has no exact knowledge as to whether these payments were made to third parties.
After the cross- examination, Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula De Livera started to re-examine the witness.
ASG Dappula De Livera: Now, You stand by with your affidavit, right?
Witness Salgado: Yes
ASG De Livera: Was this ?document? maintained by you?
W: Yes
ASG De Livera: Now this document was updated by you in which computer?
W: The Computer I used at PTL
ASG De Livera: Did anyone other than you have access to it?
W: No
ASG De Livera: Now, you earlier said that you maintained this document on the instructions of Kasun Palisena, right?
W: Yes
ASG De Livera: Who provided the information in that ?document??
W: Kasun Palisena
ASG De Livera: By what means?
W: Verbally
ASG De Livera: So, in that event, Kasun Palisena would have also looked at the computer and taken printouts of it, right?
W: Yes
ASG De Livera: That means only Kasun Palisena and You (Nuwan Salgado) knew about this document, which contained specific fund transfers (payments) from PTL to its related companies, right?
W: Yes
ASG De Livera: So, this is a secret document maintained by you and Palisena, right?
W: Yes
During this questioning the witness also explained that he started maintaining this document in 2014 on the instructions of Palisena and continued to update it. He also said from time to time he had e-mailed the document to Palisena.
The witness admitted that he deleted the document from the computer and from the sent items box of his e-mail account after sending it to PTL CEO Palisena.
ASG De Livera: Now, You referred to Udayaseelan (former EPF dealer) and Saman Kumara (former EPF dealer) as Charlie at different times, right?
W: Yes
ASG De Livera: Do you know other persons referred to as ?Charlie? in PTL?
W: No
ASG De Livera: Do you know who this ?Tango? was?
W: No
ASG De Livera: Who told you to add ?Tango? name to the document?
W: PTL CEO Kasun Palisena
During this questioning the witness said that based on the way in which the document was maintained he realized that the payment allocated from PTL to its related companies were considerations for persons coded such as ?Charlie?.
ASG De Livera: When you were shown this document by the CID officers, did you have any doubt about this document?
W: No
ASG De Livera: Now you have said that you had deleted this document, why was that?
W: I did not want any other person accessing it.
ASG De Livera: So, this was a secret document which carried sensitive information, which was known only to you and Palisena, right?
W: Yes
ASG De Livera: Were you at any time forced or suppressed by the CID or Attorney General?s Department?s officials when you prepared the affidavit?
W: No. I was not forced.
Thereafter, Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilleke also re-examined the witness with regard to the payments reflected in the document.
Drawing the witness? attention to an outright transactions list produced by PTL CEO Kasun Palisena, DSG Gunatilleke explained that there were transactions referred by Palisena as ?Netted off transactions? which PTL engaged with its related group companies. DSG Gunatilleke said the payments depicted in the document maintained by Nuwan Salgado were born out of the netted off transactions.
DSG Gunatilleke explained, that through this netted off bond transactions by PTL with its other related group companies, there were ?netted off payments? sent by PTL to its related companies.
When questioned by DSG Gunatillke, the witness said PTL had received ?cash cheques? from time to time from its related group companies (Perpetual Asset Management, W.M. Mendis & Company and Perpetual Capital Holding).
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena then questioned the witness.
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena: According to the document produced by Kasun Palisena, there was a bulk of ?netted off? transactions by PTL with its related group companies, right?
W: Yes
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena: But, Kasun Palisena wanted you to maintain a document with regard to only several transactions, right?
W: Yes
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena: Now, PTL Counsel showed you documents to prove what exactly ?Car? and ?CP Interests? refers in the document that you maintained, right?
W: Yes
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena: And they showed you several documents to prove that there was a vehicle purchase as well, right?
W: Yes
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena: But in relation to other transactions referred to as ?Charlie? (Rs. 97 million) and ?Tango? (Rs. 40 million) in the document, nothing was pointed out, right?
W: Yes
J: As PTL submitted documents to prove the transactions relating to ?Car? and ?CP Interests? were bona fide payments, there is no single document as to what happened with the funds transferred under the code name ?Charlie? and ?Tango?, right?
W: Yes
J: Why did you name those transactions with names, ?Charlie? and ?Tango?? You could have used anything?
W: Those names were given to me by Kasun Palisena
J: Why did you consider that these payments were paid to a third party?
W: because of the way in which this document was maintained, I realized that these payments were made to informants.
J: Now who added that word as ?informant??
W: I did
J: Then Kasun Palisena would have seen it as well, right?
W: Yes, because I had sent him the document on several times.
--------------------------
After a short adjournment of the proceedings, PTL Senior Dealer, Kaushitha Rathnaweera was called to testify before the Commission and Senior State Counsel Dr Avanti Perera led the evidence.
During his testimony, Mr. Rathnaweera said that there were cash cheques received by PTL from its related group companies and then he had encashed them on the instructions of Kasun Palisena and handed over the money to Palisena.
When the witness was asked to elaborated the process as to how they encashed the cheques received from its related companies, the witness said ?When my CEO refers me a cheque, I then communicate with the relevant related company?s accountant. And then the cheque is receives by us. Then I go to the bank to encash the cheque. Thereafter I give the money brought from the bank to Kasun Palisena.?
The witness said on several occasions he had done this process and there were other individuals too who had encashed these cheques at different times.
Senior State Counsel Dr Avanti Perera: Now, you said that you bring the money from bank to PTL, correct?
Witness Kaushitha Rathnaveera: Yes
Senior State Counsel Dr Avanti Perera: Then what happens?
W: I keep the money in Kasun Palisena?s room
Senior State Counsel Dr Avanti Perera: Do you know what happens to that money there after?
W: No
Senior State Counsel Dr Avanti Perera: Where do you keep that money in Kasun Palisena?s office room?
W: On CEO?s chair
The Commission at this moment, asked in a lighter vein as to why the witness thought of keeping that money on the CEO?s chair. The witness said ?I just left the money on the chair?.
Justice Jayawardena at this moment in a sarcastic manner quipped: ?was it a bomb.?
It was also revealed that there were cheques received regularly amounting to Rs. 1 million byPTL from its related group companies.
Showing several deal tickets, Senior State Counsel Dr Avanti Perera asked the witness: Did you know at all that these transactions ever took place?
W: There was no fund movement in these transactions.
These transactions were regarded as the ?netted off? transactions by Kasun Palisena which took place between PTL and its related companies. It was revealed that the payments made by PTL to its related companies were born out of these netted off transactions.
*PTL making payments ?to- Perpetual Asset Management, W.M. Mendis & Company and Perpetual Capital (Related companies)
* Related companies sending cash cheques ?to- PTL relating to the payments that were received. (Cheques were signed mainly by Arjun Aloysius, Geoffrey Aloysius and Surendran Muthuraja)
*PTL officials encashing them into money
*And handing over the money to PTL CEO Kasuna Palisena
*PTL officials unaware what happens to the money thereafter
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena then questioned the witness.
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena: Now, PTL makes payments time to time to its related group companies on the basis of some of T-bond transactions and the related companies from time to time send cash cheques to PTL, right?
W: Yes
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena: Then you encash them and hand it over to Kasun Palisena, right?
W: Yes
Justice Jayawardena then questioned the witness on the signatures reflected in some of the cheques that the witness had produced before the Commission.
During this questioning it was revealed that Arjun Aloysius, Geoffrey Aloysius and Surendran Muthuraja had signed these cheques, which came from PTL?s related companies (Perpetual Asset Management, W.M. Mendis & Company and Perpetual Capital Holdings)
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena: So, is it correct to say that Perpetual Capital Holding was the ultimate holding company of PTL?
W: Yes
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena: And that holding company is solely controlled by the father and son, Arjun Aloysius and Geoffrey Aloysius, right?
W: Yes
Thereafter, Counsel Arulpragasam appearing on behalf of PTL and the President?s Counsel Anuja Premaratne appearing for Arjun Aloysius cross-examined the witness.
During this cross-examination Justice K.T. Chitrasiri and Justice Prasanna Jayawardena both questioned the witness as to why he did not question Kasun Palisena when he handed over large amounts of money. The witness said he did not think about it and only thought that it was none of his business.
Mr. Anuja Premaratne was of the view that the process in which the payments were received from related companies to PTL was not illegal.
At this moment, Justice Jayawardena said ?Payments are not illegal but the use of that money may or may not be illegal?. (Shehan Chamika Silva )

Thilokasundari Kariyawasam - Measure of a life well lived
	
It is hard for me to make sense of the loss of my aunt, my ?Loku Nanda,? Dr. Thilokasundari Kariyawasam in terms of what she achieved and how she lived her life. Indeed, there are certain truths about her most people would agree upon. She was a formidable lady, an expert in her field of educational psychology, and that of her intellect, her determination and drive saw her advance from a school teacher to the Director General of National Institute of Education.? ?
Most will acknowledge that she helped a thousand people. She authored dozens of books, hundreds of articles, numerous radio and television interviews, and made a countless number of speeches at events. She was able to manage all this while being a wife, mother, sister, cousin, friend, an aunt and a grandmother, radiating inspiration.?
It is important to state that Loku Nanda was a constant presence in our lives. She was steadfast, strong, loving, kind and generous to a fault. Her home, her personality, became an eternal core to our lives.?
My Loku Nanda was the eldest girl in a family of seven. She was unique from the start as she was named Thilokasundari. The name of a queen of Sri? Lanka. A name denoting the aspiration of two school teachers who later became principals had for their daughters.?
?
It is important to have the drive and determination to succeed, but it must be coupled with compassion and kindness
?
Our grandparents hailed from Gampaha. They wanted their children to study well. So they left Gampaha to reside in Punchi Borella. The boys attended Ananda and the daughters Visakha and subsequently Peradeniya? University.?
Loku Nanda had achieved a number of firsts, becoming a principal at the age of 29 to go abroad and obtain a doctorate. These achievements themselves are astounding at a time when women were expected to remain as housewives. While most people try to get the best of the minutes in a day, she managed to balance marriage, motherhood and her job and still had time for creativity. A prolific writer, her books on early childhood education, Buddhism, psychology and children?s novels reflected the complexity of her interests. The admired photographs of her family and the numerous awards received for her work were given pride of place on top of her China-cabinet.? What I wish to emphasize is that I loved her and will continue to do so. I adore my Loku Nanda being the daughter of her ?Panditha? malli, Prof. Wanasinghe. She and my father were very close from childhood. In fact, they were best friends.?
My earliest memory of Loku Nanda was her compassionate, gentle and twinkling-eyed smile. That was on a trip to Yala, one which most likely she organised. I recall Loku Nanda had a number of sayings, the most persistent was ?lack of communication? during trips. She was a stickler for schedule.?
What needs to be highlighted in this brief note is that despite all her accomplishments, she was not a dimensional person. She joined all her brothers and sisters to sew and cook anything, from ?Pol Sambol? to ?Biryani.? She had a photographic memory which she made good use of. Her jokes were many and her laughter was rich. I recall her singing songs from the 1950s and 1960s together with her sisters, brothers and in-laws. She lived her life in Colombo but was a village girl at heart, from the food she loved to her understanding of the challenges faced by ordinary people. I recall during 1987 to 1990, when shops were closed and people frightened, Loku Mama welcomed visitors with a table laden with food and kindness. Once, a couple who had come from afar to visit a relative at the General Hospital came to see her. While entertaining them, she gently inquired about the well-being and needs of the hospitalised patient. The couple left after meals with a packet of milk and sugar for their relative at the hospital. She was that kind of person.?
?
?She was steadfast, strong, loving, kind and generous to a fault. Her home, her personality, became an eternal core to our lives
?
She became more remarkable with three wonderful children ? Vidya, Haran and Miuru, who themselves made her proud with their achievements. Her work ethics were exemplary. She would wake up at 5.00 a.m. and write articles, or even an editorial. But the most significant thing I learnt was that while it is important to have the drive and determination to succeed, it must be coupled with compassion and kindness. She wanted all of us to nurture our natural abilities instead of becoming someone we were not. She always encouraged us ? her children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews and their children ? to be united as a family unit. She was proud of our achievements and was equally upset if any tragedy befell them. She remained as a rock, strong enough to carry victory and defeat.?
These memories, which made Loku Nanda so wonderful, will remain forever.?

## Title: West must remove war crime threats on SL: Lord Naseby

West must remove war crime threats on SL: Lord Naseby
	
The West, particularly the US and the UK, must remove the threat of war crimes and foreign judges that overhangs and overshadows all Sri Lankans, especially their leaders, a British Baron told the British Parliament on Thursday.
Michael Morris, Baron Naseby PC, who started the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Sri Lanka in 1975, expressed these views during a debate on Sri Lanka.
The debate focused on what assessment the UK Government has made of the progress made by Sri Lanka in meeting the requirements on reconciliation established by the United Nations Human Rights Council.
Lord Naseby said he hoped that, as a result of the debate, the UK will recognise the truth that no one in the Sri Lankan Government ever wanted to kill Tamil civilians.
?Furthermore, the UK must now get the UN and the UNHCR in Geneva to accept a civilian casualty level of 7,000 to 8,000, not 40,000. On top of that, the UK must recognise that this was a war against terrorism, so the rules of engagement are based on international humanitarian law, not the European Convention on Human Rights,? he said.
Responding to Lord Naseby, State Minister Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon said the UK recognised that reconciliation is vital for Sri Lanka?s future success.
?However, it is important to address all the commitments together, because they are closely linked. Without truth, justice, respect for human rights and a commitment to long-term peace, there can be no lasting reconciliation,? he said.
He said under Sri Lanka?s current coalition Government there exists, as we all recognise, a historic window of opportunity to build a lasting peace.
?Meeting the commitments made in Resolution 30/1, including on reconciliation, will be essential to making this happen,? he said.
The full debate on Sri LankaLord Naseby
To ask Her Majesty's Government what assessment they have made of the progress made by the coalition government of Sri Lanka in meeting the requirements on reconciliation established by the United Nations Human Rights Council.
My Lords, I declare an interest: I started the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Sri Lanka in 1975 and am currently its president. I have known Sri Lanka for over 50 years.
I believe the UK has a unique role to play in the future of Sri Lanka, but we need to understand the history behind the current situation. In the 11th century AD Tamil Cholas invaded Sri Lanka and took over the north and north-east. Understandably, the Sinhalese were left with the remainder. Then there was colonisation by the Portuguese, the Dutch and then of course the UK. The British left behind a very good civil service; unfortunately, it was not spread across the two main denominations. It was dominated by the Tamils, who looked after the civil service and indeed the professions. On independence, sadly, this position was somewhat resented by the Sinhalese, and they passed the Sinhalese official language Act.
There remained some smouldering resentment from 1948 right through to around 1973. The Tamil youth have been activated by two people in particular. One is Mr Balasingham, a British citizen after Mr Blair?s Government gave him that, and the other is a man called Prabhakaran, a single-minded ruthless activist. In 1973 Prabhakaran killed the mayor of Jaffna, along with six soldiers whose bodies were brought to Colombo. There was a resentful response from the Sinhalese youth; very sadly it was three days before a curfew was brought in, and well over 1,000 Tamils were killed. From then on it has been a situation of Eelam, the independent state, on one side versus the unitary state of Sri Lanka on the other.
Fast forward to 18 May 2009. The Tamil Tiger terrorists are defeated in a military solution, and after nearly 30 years of war there is peace across the whole island, as there is today. This is followed by a presidential election in January 2015 when President Sirisena is elected to head a coalition Government. The platform of that Government was to achieve reconciliation, ensure a durable peace, promote and protect human rights, uphold the rule of law and strengthen good governance and democracy. Out of that flowed UN Resolution 30/1of 1 October 2015.
I visited Sri Lanka last February. Eight months on it is quite clear to me, from the context that I have, that the Government are addressing all the issues raised in the UN resolution. It may be taking longer than some would wish but that is life, I think. I shall highlight <U+200B>three. The first is missing persons. A massive amount of time and effort was put into the Paranagama commission, set up by the previous Rajapaksa Government, identifying some 20,000 missing persons and actually following up 10,000 of them. To this can be added the superb work done by the ICRC.
The good news is that a commissioner and a department are now set up, and in passing I pay tribute to the enormous hard work putting by Sir Desmond de Silva and his two colleagues. Sri Lanka must be eternally grateful that men of their wisdom and experience have got this task moving in the first place.
On prevention of terrorism, there is acceptance that a new Act is needed?there was in February. I cannot understand why it is taking quite so long to get it on the statute book. The constitution is being debated?the good news is that the leading Tamil party is actively taking part?and the problem of devolution is being addressed. However, the West needs to understand that the East cannot necessarily produce a mirror image of a western structure.
In passing, I pay considerable tribute to Halo and its Sri Lankan operatives, along with the Indians, Canadians and the Sri Lankan army, for clearing a square metre a day of ground, which makes it possible for families to return to the land.
What is not on track and needs urgent attention is the war crimes allegations hanging over the country. These flow from the Darusman report, which, on a best-guess basis, two years after the end of the war, stated,
?there is still no reliable figure for civilian deaths?,
but then guessed at 40,000. This figure is bandied about by virtually every human rights organisation and the thousands of Tamil diaspora throughout the world, many of whom were LTTE Tamil Tiger supporters and still are, inflamed by Tamil Net and those ghastly Channel 4 ?Killing Fields? films, which so influenced the previous Prime Minister.
I have discovered an unpublished report from the United Nations country team, which stated that from August 2008 up to 13 May 2009, the number of civilians killed was 7,721. The war ended six days later, so it cannot possibly have got up to 40,000. Then I looked at what Gordon Weiss, the former UN spokesman said. He produced an estimate in 2009 of 7,000 civilian deaths. He also made the simple observation that, for the Sri Lankan army, it made no tactical sense to kill civilians. University Teachers for Human Rights is not exactly a right-wing organisation; in fact, it is probably on the far left. It had similar figures, and commented that from what happened it could not say that the purpose of bombing or shelling by government forces was to kill civilians. It also said that ground troops took great trouble not to harm civilians.
The Sri Lankan Government?s census department?a very genuine department? issued an in-depth census leading to the conclusion that 7,000 to 8,000 were missing. US Ambassador Blake stated on 7 April that there were deaths of 4,164 from 20 January to 6 April. Major General Holmes in his expert military report of March 2015 concurs with 7,000 to 8,000. Above all, all the people I have cited state that there was no policy to <U+200B>kill civilians?in fact, the opposite. To these I add the British defence attach?, Lieutenant Colonel Anton Gash, who said to me in January 2009 that he was surprised at the controlled discipline and success of the Sri Lankan army and in particular the care that it was taking to encourage civilians to escape and how well they were looked after, and that certainly there was no policy to kill civilians. There could not be a better military man: he is knowledgeable, independent and would be authoritative about what happened in his reports in his dispatches. So I decided to make a freedom of information submission to the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office concerning those dispatches in the period 1 January to 19 May 2009. The original submission went in on 6 November, but was rejected. Two appeals to higher authorities at the Foreign Office were rejected, so I appealed to the Information Commissioner?with more success. She listened and, as a result of her representations, 26 pages of heavily redacted dispatches were sent me.
Obviously, I looked at them with some care. I challenged the lack of dispatches in the last two months. Amazingly, another 12 pages appeared, all redacted.
Still concerned about the lack of dispatches in the past few days, I made a final appeal to the First-tier Tribunal, assisted my very good friend Amal Abeywardene. We had the sympathy of the judges for the cause, but they accepted the Foreign Office view that if confidential information was given out, nobody in future would give us any more. So I now have the princely sum of 39 pages of heavily redacted dispatches?nevertheless, if you dig deeply, as in life, you find some real gems. For example, on 28 January:
?It is not possible to distinguish civilians from LTTE cadres as few are in uniform?.
Then, from 16 February:
?IDPs being cared for in Trincomalee. Welfare appears to be overriding security considerations?.
Then on 20 January they say,
?no cluster munitions were used?,
and on 26 April,
?civilians killed Feb 1-April 26?6432?.
I hope and pray that, as a result of this debate, the UK will recognise the truth that no one in the Sri Lankan Government ever wanted to kill Tamil civilians. Furthermore, the UK must now get the UN and the UNHCR in Geneva to accept a civilian casualty level of 7,000 to 8,000, not 40,000. On top of that, the UK must recognise that this was a war against terrorism, so the rules of engagement are based on international humanitarian law, not the European Convention on Human Rights. The West, and in particular the US and UK, must remove the threat of war crimes and foreign judges that overhangs and overshadows all Sri Lankans, especially their leaders. We in the UK should reflect on the sacrifices of thousands of young Sri Lankan soldiers who died to create peace in that country. Finally, I reflect that Sri Lanka came to our need in two world wars and had casualties, and it was one of just a handful of countries who supported the UK over the Falklands. Now is the time to offer the hand of friendship and act to lead the international community to recognise what the truth really was.<U+200B>Baroness Berridge (Con)
My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Naseby for securing this debate?and I declare an interest as project director for the Commonwealth Initiative for Freedom of Religion and Belief.
The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Sri Lanka in 2013 helped to focus international attention on the human rights failures of previous Sri Lankan Governments, and the decision of the then Prime Minister David Cameron to attend was, I submit, correct as this international spotlight helped to form part of the driving forces that secured a peaceful transition of power in January and August 2015. Resolution 30/1 of the Human Rights Council came after this democratic transition of power, which saw an alliance of moderates from within the two largest parties, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and the United National Party, form a ruling coalition. The resolution stresses the importance of protecting the human rights of all Sri Lankans, regardless of ethnic and religious identity. That of course includes the right to freedom of religion and belief, as outlined in Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The UN Sri Lankan Peacebuilding Priority Plan also stresses the importance of promoting and protecting the human rights of vulnerable peoples.
It is important to recognise the often underappreciated significance of religion to the conflict and the peace process in Sri Lanka. As Dr Rajesh Venugopal of the London School of Economics argues, both Tamil and Sinhalese national identities are bound to Hinduism and Buddhism respectively. Sri Lanka is one of only seven Buddhist majority countries in the world, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, Bhutan, Laos and Mongolia, being the other six. Around 70% of the population identify as Buddhist. However, the country has sizeable religious minorities, with 12.6% identifying as Hindu, 9.7% as Muslim and 7.6% as Christian. Although Tamils are largely Hindu, it is less well known that Muslims and Christians are often seen as outsiders by both the Government and the Tamil militants, thereby suffering at the hands of both. As the Asia Foundation?s Sri Lanka Strategic Assessment 2016 argues, religious violence and hatred serves as a major barrier to securing a long-term peaceful Sri Lanka.
The Sri Lankan constitution currently protects freedom of religion or belief, in Article 10 of Chapter III, and the right to worship individually or as a group, in Article 14(1)(e) of Chapter III.
However, under the previous Government, freedom of religion and belief was eroded because of the tacit acceptance by the state of extreme Buddhist sects which propagate an exclusive image of Sri Lankan identity as solely Buddhist, with non- Buddhists as ?others?, whose loyalty and citizenship should be in question. Ultra-nationalist Sinhalese Buddhist organisations, such as Bodu Bala Sena, were able to spread hatred towards both Muslims and Christians with impunity. In April 2014, BBS raided an interfaith press conference and no action was taken by the authorities. Also in 2014, there was a nationwide BBS anti-halal campaign, which contributed to the toxic environment of religious hatred and, arguably, to the anti-Muslim Aluthgama riots, during which at least <U+200B>four people were killed, 80 injured and 10,000 displaced. The then Government responded by ordering a media blackout and, at the Human Rights Council in June that year, blamed Muslims for the riots.
There is evidence, however, of a change in the response to such events. On 26 September?less than a month ago?a mob of hard-line nationalists led by Buddhist monks attacked a UN shelter for Rohingya Muslim refugees in Colombo. The Cabinet spokesman, Rajitha Senaratne, was unequivocal in his condemnation the following day, saying:
?As a Buddhist I am ashamed at what happened ? this is not what Buddha taught?.
The refugees were quickly moved to a safe location and the Government have now arrested nine people. It is so good?but all too unusual?to hear of such prompt action by a Government that had previously stood by and watched. I am grateful to Dr Rajesh Venugopal from LSE for bringing this to my attention.
Secondly, the change in government has shown a marked decrease in violence towards Christians. A report published by Verit? in 2015 highlighted that the average number of attacks carried out against Christians had declined from one every week between 1994 and 2014 to roughly one every two weeks since 2015. This is, again, a change to be commended. But Sri Lanka has also faced challenges over the practice of conversion, with many religious groups complaining of Buddhists and Hindus being converted to Christianity through alleged material and spiritual inducements. In 2015, the opposition JHU put forward a Bill that would have contravened international standards on the right of people to convert. It is another encouraging sign that Sri Lanka was able to protect the individual?s right to freedom of religion and belief and to change religion by resisting such draconian legislation.
Can the Minister confirm whether Her Majesty?s Government have taken this opportunity to make positive representations to the Sri Lankan Government, commending their response to this most recent attack on Rohingya refugees, and confirm if they have considered whether this example beginning to be set by Sri Lanka of a Buddhist majority Government working to protect religious minorities could become best practice to promote? Such encouragement is crucial because the Sri Lankan Government still have much ground to cover to tackle the remaining significant structural and societal challenges to sustained religious harmony in Sri Lanka. A Minority Rights Group report in 2016 sadly found that harassment and intimidation of both Muslims and Christians, although decreasing?as I have outlined?was still commonplace. While the new Government restricted the space for groups such as BBS, it has continued to spread vicious hatred towards Muslims online. Between November 2015 and September 2016, there were 14 incidents in which Christian establishments were forced to close by local officials using the unconstitutional 2008 government circular, which stipulated that new places of worship must be approved by the then Ministry of Religious Affairs. The MRG report has also shown that local police and local officials still often refuse to record the complaints of or assist Christian pastors and communities who have been harassed by Buddhist extremists.<U+200B>
The excellent work begun by the Sri Lankan Government to foster religious unity, freedom and tolerance, although incomplete, should be supported. At present, outside of disaster relief, DfID has only one active programme in Sri Lanka, which is of course focused on removing landmines. This is clearly important, but there is a need to support the Sri Lankan Government?s effort to confront these elements of Buddhist extremism. I would be grateful to know from my noble friend whether looking at this Buddhist extremism is part of Her Majesty?s Government?s counterextremism work within the FCO. Sadly, such erroneous theology is part of the backdrop to the recent plight of the Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar and urgently needs addressing.
As Jonathan Goodhand of SOAS argues, religious leaders in Sri Lanka are ideally placed to cross political, ethnic and religious boundaries to promote a culture of inclusivity and tolerance. Successful interfaith projects, such as Equitas supported by the Canadian Government, reach over 3,000 people and conduct vital research into the issues faced by religious minorities in Sri Lanka. Similarly, the Karuna Centre for Peacebuilding, with US government support, brings together over 80 Hindu, Buddhist, Muslim and Christian religious leaders in Sri Lanka?s troubled eastern province to build trust and common ground as peacebuilders. I am not naive: there are still grave problems and much needs to be done. However, I know that my noble friend the Minister is passionate about freedom of religion and belief, and it is encouraging to report the emergence of some rare good news in that country. Therefore, I hope my noble friend can outline whether staff from DfID or the Foreign and Commonwealth Office?s Magna Carta Fund for Human Rights and Democracy will visit these projects to see whether we can establish programmes using best practice. As I say, perhaps such best practice programmes are transferable or useful in the context of what we are seeing in Myanmar and other countries.
Baroness Cox (CB)
My Lords, I also congratulate very warmly the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, on this debate and on his very comprehensive opening speech.
I have only visited Sri Lanka once, after the tsunami left its tragic aftermath of death, destruction and devastation. However, I am aware of the help that the noble Lord and his medically qualified wife provided in January 2005, when I believe they rushed out to help those suffering from the tsunami. I presume that is one of the reasons why he was awarded the Sri Lanka Ratna in November of that year. I quote briefly from the citation:
?This is the highest honour of the country conferred on non-nationals. It is awarded for exceptionally outstanding and most distinguished service to Sri Lanka?.
I am also aware, of course, of the noble Lord?s Oral Questions and, having listened to his speech this afternoon, I must admit that I admire his persistence in the use of the Freedom of Information Act to extract the dispatches from the Foreign Office.
Although I do not know the current situation and issues in Sri Lanka in detail, I am well aware of the challenges any country faces in a post-conflict situation. I knew that the President made a speech to the UN on <U+200B>19 September, which I read with great interest. The speech reflected the topic of the 72nd session of the General Assembly:
?Focusing on People: Striving for Peace and a Decent Life on a Sustainable Planet?.
As the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, has already highlighted, Sri Lanka has suffered greatly from nearly 30 years of civil war, which ended on 18 May 2009. In January 2015, President Sirisena was elected and formed, for the first time in Sri Lanka?s history, a coalition Government of the two main parties. I would like briefly to refer to issues and quotations from his speech, which I found both moving and relevant.
First, having acknowledged the fact that the executive presidency in Sri Lanka had been invested with more power than that invested in any other political leader in the democratic world, he gave a commitment to shed some of these powers and to transfer them to Parliament?surely a commendable commitment. Secondly, he gave a commitment to promote the rights of women: for example, an amendment to the constitution to ensure that 25% of the list of candidates at elections should comprise women. Thirdly, in the context of genuine concerns over human rights abuses, the President gave a commitment,
?to strengthen national reconciliation, and ensure that all people living in my country, speaking different languages and of different religions are able to live in unity, without fear, suspicion, hatred and anger. We are determined to build a society where everyone is able to live with freedom and dignity as equal citizens. My Government is committed to achieve these ends in a holistic manner through the strengthening of the domestic economy and the creation of prosperity and taking steps to create a disciplined and righteous society. Consolidating the rule of law and righteousness are priorities to which my Government remains committed ?
Accordingly, we seek the respectful support of all, as we take steps in a progressive manner, to address allegations and implement resolutions, while protecting the independence and sovereignty of my country ... As a country which has suffered an almost 30-year-long conflict, I urge the respectful support of all, in ensuring the success of the journey we have embarked upon to unite the people who were torn by division in my country?.
I am not lacking in concern regarding the very serious problems and suffering which have afflicted so many of the citizens of Sri Lanka. Indeed, following my own visit after the tsunami, we wrote a report highlighting our concerns over grave violations of human rights, including freedom of religion and belief, and there have been recent reports from international human rights organisations, such as Amnesty International and the International Crisis Group.
However, the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, has put many of these concerns in context and, although remaining concerns need to be addressed, there has been progress, which is to be welcomed. Some indications of that were mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Berridge.
In urging Her Majesty?s Government to offer a hand of friendship to Sri Lanka now, I will go off-piste for a moment but in a way which I think is not irrelevant. The United States is currently lifting sanctions against the Government of Sudan?an initiative supported by the United Kingdom?while the Government in Khartoum continue to oppress their own citizens in Darfur, the Nuba Mountains and Blue Nile, as well as perpetrate a catalogue of violations of the fundamental freedoms and human rights of their people elsewhere <U+200B>throughout the nation, with a President indicted by the International Criminal Court. I am not asking the Minister to comment on Sudan in this debate but I wish to put on record my concern that President al-Bashir has made no commitments similar to those made by the President of Sri Lanka.
I conclude with a final reference to the President of Sri Lanka, who appealed in his speech to the UN:
?I seek your support for the development efforts we have undertaken that are essential for the reconciliation efforts to succeed and ensure non-recurrence of conflict and our vision of a nation that is righteous, prosperous and democratic, to succeed, as an example to other countries that are also recovering from conflict?.
Therefore, I fully support the appeal made by the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, to Her Majesty?s Government to offer a hand of friendship and appropriate support to Sri Lanka and its President as he seeks to implement his commitments to bring healing, hope and peace to a nation and a people who have suffered too much for too long. I hope the Minister will be able to offer some reassurance in his reply.
Lord Sheikh (Con)
My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Naseby for bringing this important subject before your Lordships? House. I am a friend of Sri Lanka. I have visited the country three times and met its leaders and other senior figures. I also enjoy a healthy long-standing relationship with its high commissioner in London. Here in Parliament, I am a vice-chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Sri Lanka. I have raised issues relating to Sri Lanka on several occasions in your Lordships? House. I believe that it is in the political and economic interests of the United Kingdom to maintain a close and productive relationship with Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka was torn apart by civil war. Conflict prevailed for 26 years and caused immeasurable suffering. An estimated 100,000 people lost their lives and hundreds of thousands more lost their homes. It has been eight years since the fighting ceased. People are now returning to their communities and attempting to rebuild their lives. In order for permanent peace to be achieved, the Sri Lankan Government are making the necessary reforms towards reconciliation. I am pleased that this is being done. However, they must ensure that all communities feel that proper and transparent justice has been served for the atrocities that took place. Until this happens, wounds cannot be fully healed.
It is important to note some of the specific positive measures that have already been taken by the Sri Lankan Government. A national policy on reconciliation and coexistence has been approved to serve as a framework to prevent conflict reoccurring. A task force has held public consultations to inform the development of new and transitional systems of justice and reparations. Powers have been devolved from the presidency to the Parliament, and presidential term limits have been reintroduced. Independent bodies have also been set up to maintain oversight of key public institutions, including the police and the judiciary. The security services are also being trained to fully comply with international human rights law, particularly with regard to people who have been arrested or detained. It is <U+200B>important that we applaud this progress and use it to provide further incentives for Sri Lanka to continue such momentum.
The European Union took this approach earlier this year, when it granted Sri Lanka enhanced market access status through the generalised scheme of preferences, which is commonly known as GSP+. This removes around two-thirds of import duties on Sri Lankan products entering the EU market. The EU Trade Commissioner stated that this was a vote of confidence that Sri Lanka will maintain its progress in implementing international conventions. She also mentioned that the situation was still unsatisfactory in many areas and that more work needed to be done.
Indeed, there is some concern that the progress of reform has slowed in recent months. Much more assertive efforts need to be made in a number of respects. Of particular concern are the tens of thousands of people who are still unaccounted for. Many people are still seeking the truth about what happened to their friends and family during the war. There are horrific accounts of people being forcibly removed from their homes by heavy-handed military or police officers.
There are many allegations of human rights abuses on both sides. Whatever the truth, it is important that the allegations are investigated swiftly and with transparency. The integrity and impartiality of the judiciary will be crucial in this respect.
The Government recently introduced the Office of Missing Persons. This office will attempt to search and trace those who are missing and determine the circumstances in which they went missing. It is now important that progress is accelerated. I support the calls for Sri Lanka to produce a timetable for implementation of further reforms, particularly with regard to transitional justice mechanisms. There also needs to be much faster movement towards revising the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which is viewed by many as a key cause of human rights abuses.
The UN special rapporteur on human rights and counterterrorism visited Sri Lanka in July. His report stated that positive steps were being taken, but that Sri Lanka was still falling short on measures that would achieve long-term solutions and benefit all communities. Specifically, he said that he was encouraged by the Government?s zero tolerance of the use of torture, but that it had become so endemic in the security sector that it remained a little bit of a problem. In short, the Sri Lankan Government are trying to put?and seem committed to putting?the right policies in place. However, the level of fundamental change required in practice is proving somewhat difficult in some areas.
Last month, President Sirisena made an address to the United Nations. He spoke of the importance of protecting and strengthening democracy and of using power responsibly. He was also clear in his commitment to build a society that promotes true freedom and equality. He was equally clear on the need for support from the United Nations in order to fully achieve these aims. I received his speech as an acknowledgement of the work that still lies ahead, but also as a plea for respectful support from the international community. <U+200B>There was clearly a sense of caution that, if measures are imposed too heavily and hastily, there is a risk of destabilising progress. What was my noble friend the Minister?s reaction to this speech?
I must also mention the importance of economic prosperity for Sri Lanka. I held a debate in your Lordships? House on increasing bilateral trade between the United Kingdom and Sri Lanka. Trade can serve as a route to improve the financial position of many and can assist a country?s economic and social development. Sri Lanka has much to offer and I hope that we will look more closely at furthering our trading relationship with it, particularly as we look beyond Europe.
Since the conflict ended, successive Sri Lankan Governments have set a course for the island to become a major commercial maritime hub. I reiterate what I have said in your Lordships? House with regard to trade with Sri Lanka.. Britain should look carefully at the opportunities to exploit the rapidly changing economic landscape of this region. There are already about 100 British companies successfully operating in Sri Lanka in an environment that is already seen as one of the most liberalised economies in south Asia. Yet more rapid growth is expected, with an array of free trade agreements coming on stream to facilitate access to massively expanding Asian marketplaces. Sri Lanka should be seen as an excellent staging post for British businesses in the post-Brexit era to penetrate major markets from India to China. What positive action is being taken to accelerate trade between Sri Lanka and the United Kingdom?
Sri Lanka has undergone extreme turmoil and is still in the early stages of reconciliation. Peacebuilding is slow and often frustrating. The unity Government have made strides that were not possible just five years ago. We must recognise this and understand the fragile climate that still exists. I hope we can move forward with a policy of positive engagement, firm scrutiny and support for Sri Lanka. Finally, I would ask my noble friend how best we can achieve these objectives.
Lord Collins of Highbury (Lab)
My Lords, I too thank the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, for initiating the debate and for his comprehensive introduction. As we have heard from all noble Lords, in 2009, Sri Lanka <U+200B>emerged from a brutal Tamil war of independence after 26 years of fighting and terrorism. Since the adoption of the Human Rights Commission resolution in 2015, the Sri Lankan coalition Government formed that year were expected to fulfil the recommendations of taking specific measures for institutional reform, justice, truth and reparations.
Although I hear the noble Lord?s optimism, I have to also acknowledge the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Sheikh. Last month, following a four-day visit, the UN?s special rapporteur, Ben Emmerson, found that the country?s judicial system and tolerance of torture is a,
?stain on the country?s international reputation?.
He warned that if government inertia over reform does not end, the authorities will have created,
?precisely the conditions likely to produce festering grievances, to foster unrest and even to reignite conflict?.
As we have heard, one of the key undertakings in the resolution was security sector reform, including repealing and replacing the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act. I very much support the United Kingdom?s call on the Sri Lankan Government to deliver on its commitments laid out in the UN resolution at the Human Rights Council on 11 September. I welcome our Government?s actions in that respect.
President Sirisena held a meeting with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra?ad Al Hussein, on the margins of the recent UN General Assembly. He was told by the commissioner to accelerate the pace of fulfilling all the obligations in the 2015 consensual resolution. However, President Sirisena argued that hastening the process would give an undue advantage to extremists and invited the high commissioner to visit Sri Lanka next year to see progress.
Noble Lords have highlighted the progress made and I do not want to undermine it. The president pointed out that he had signed the gazette notification operationalising the Office on Missing Persons before he left for the US. He also said that the draft Bill on a new constitution was presented to the Parliament?all good progress. The Sri Lankan Government also stated that all lands in the eastern province that were under the custody of the security forces had now been released and a considerable number of lands in the north, too, have already been released. For the rest of the lands, measures are being taken to resolve the administrative problems and these will also be released to people gradually.
But there still is a heavy military presence in the northern part of the country, which is a serious challenge to transitional justice. The largely Sinhalese and Buddhist army engages in everyday commercial activity, for example. It runs shops, restaurants and hotels, leaving local businesses unable to compete. It is common practice for the army to occupy, cultivate and harvest farmlands and sell produce back to the local community. If that continues, it is bound to increase discontent among Tamil communities and lead to a rise in protests. Those are the issues that need to be addressed.
Lord Naseby
As I said, I went there in February and I saw the shops being closed. I was told that there was no trading activity anymore and I checked with <U+200B>the traders who confirmed that.. The noble Lord is right that trading was happening extensively, but it now seems to have ceased?or at any rate at least 95% ceased.
Lord Collins of Highbury
My Lords, I think that the difference between us is about the pace of progress. I acknowledge that things are happening?I said that in my opening remarks. But if we do not speed up the pace of reform, there is certainly the prospect of continuing discontent. What ongoing discussions are the Government having with the Sri Lankan Government to encourage this demilitarisation of the north and expedite the full return of land by the military to the owners?
As we have been reminded in this debate?by the noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, in particular?the last session of the UN Human Rights Council on 29 September heard allegations of genocide, systematic discrimination, torture, extrajudicial killings and militarisation levelled against Sri Lanka. That is beside the call by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights for the second time in two sessions for universal jurisdiction to be exercised. Of course, universal jurisdiction is the principal etched in law that every country has an interest in and responsibility to bring to justice perpetrators of the most abhorrent crimes, enforcing international legal norms. That is absolutely fundamental to protecting human rights and supporting peace and stability. They must be a priority for the international community. Does the Minister agree that all nations must reject impunity, embrace the principle of universal jurisdiction and clearly state that the alleged perpetrators will be arrested if they cross international borders?
Accountability for atrocities committed in Sri Lanka can offer the country a chance to heal the divisions of the past. That is the process that all noble Lords have been referring to. What effort is the FCO making to constructively engage with Sri Lanka and advance its commitments to reconciliation? Security sector reform, including repealing and replacing the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act, must be a key feature of that. As Ben Emmerson concluded, the use of torture has been and remains today endemic and routine for those of us arrested and detained on national security grounds. Since the authorities use that legislation disproportionately against members of the Tamil community, that community has borne the brunt of the state?s well-oiled torture apparatus. What representations have the UK Government made to Sri Lanka on the conclusions reached by Ben Emmerson, which confirmed similar findings to those of Human Rights Watch and other organisations?
The noble Baroness, Lady Berridge, referred to the events of two weeks ago in Sri Lanka when a mob led by Buddhist monks filmed a UN safe house sheltering Rohingya refugees. I, too, welcome both the condemnation from the Sri Lankan Government and the actions to be taken against the perpetrators of that crime. I ask the Minister whether the Government have urged the Sri Lankan people to ensure the perpetrators are properly held to account. There is, and remains, widespread concern that they will not be, and it is important that we keep up the pressure.
I join in the support of the noble Baroness, Lady Berridge, for sharing best practice, particularly in terms of extending freedom of religious belief, but human <U+200B>rights is a broad band of principles.
One of the things that concerns me, to which I want the Minister to respond, is that earlier this year, after a vote in their Parliament, the Sri Lankan Government decided to keep their law making homosexuality illegal. Despite that decision, Cabinet members agreed to update their human rights action plan with an addendum that bans discrimination against someone based on their sexual orientation. Although that is a step in the right direction for the Sri Lankan LGBT community, it fears it will not stop facing abuse while the law telling people homosexuality is wrong exists. Many of the LGBT citizens polled by Human Rights Watch revealed they had been sexually or physically abused by local police, and at one point over half of them said they had been detained by police without reason. There was also a recent hate crime where a trans woman and HIV advocate was murdered. Can the Minister assure us that adequate time, not only for freedom of religious belief and other human rights issues, will be given at the Commonwealth Summit for these issues to be fully aired and considered at all the fora?including, most importantly, at the Heads of Government Meeting?
The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon) (Con)
My Lords, I thank and acknowledge my noble friend Lord Naseby both for tabling the debate and for his long-standing commitment to Sri Lanka, including his role as honorary president of the all-party group?I am sure everyone else in the Chamber and beyond will do so, too. His tabling of this important debate at the current time comes when we are seeing progress in the right way in Sri Lanka.
When one stands at the Dispatch Box as a Minister for the Foreign Office and a Minister for Human Rights, it is important to acknowledge progress. The contributions across the Chamber reflected the fact that challenges remain, but the tone and content of all the contributions, without exception, also threw a very positive light?rightly so?on the positive steps have been taken recently in Sri Lanka.
I will turn to human rights to begin with. As noble Lords will know, Sri Lanka has now co-sponsored two Human Rights Council resolutions relating to the legacy of the conflict in the country: Resolution 30/1 in 2015 and Resolution 34/1 in March this year. The second of the two called on the Sri Lankan Government to fully implement outstanding measures to promote accountability, reconciliation and human rights, as set out in the first. Therefore, the question posed by my noble friend Lord Naseby is one that asks about the aspects of the commitment made by the Sri Lankan Government: namely, reconciliation. Again, contributions today have reflected progress in this respect.
We all recognise that reconciliation is vital for Sri Lanka?s future success. However, it is important to address all the commitments together, because they are closely linked. Without truth, justice, respect for human rights and a commitment to long-term peace, there can be no lasting reconciliation. I say to my noble friend Lady Berridge and to the noble Lord, Lord Collins, that when we talk of human rights, we <U+200B>talk of universal human rights, including the protection of freedom of religious belief and of LGBT rights as well as of other human rights. It is important not only that we stand up for those but vocalise them. That is why the UK Government believe that implementation of Resolution 30/1 is essential for real reconciliation to take place. I acknowledge that, in co-sponsoring both resolutions, the Sri Lankan Government have shown that they recognise this, too.
As all noble Lords have acknowledged, there has been progress. In March, a report from the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights recognised the steps taken since January 2015 to improve the human rights situation. In particular, our Government welcome: the restoration of important democratic checks and balances; improvements in freedom of expression and free movement; the return of some land held by the military to civilians; the establishment of an Office for Missing Persons; ratification of the convention on enforced disappearances, which my noble friend Lord Naseby mentioned; and, finally, the start of a process of constitutional reform. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Collins, for supporting the position of the Government and showing that, on this matter, both Her Majesty?s Opposition and the Government are at one.
There is a clear sense that the climate of fear that existed under the previous Government in Sri Lanka has largely been replaced by one in which individuals?notably, the President himself?and the media feel confident about expressing hope and aspiration and speaking openly and honestly about the challenges facing the country. My noble friend Lord Sheikh and the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, both mentioned the President?s contributions. We can take great hope from the aspirations and aims that he set out for building the new Sri Lanka that he wishes to see, as underlined by the commitments in the two resolutions that I referred to earlier.
I am pleased to say to the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, that UK funding and our diplomatic work are having a positive impact on efforts to promote reconciliation. In Tellippalai in the north of the country, we are funding the clearance of landmines, which is helping displaced families return to their land and homes and rebuild their lives. In Jaffna, our long-running community policing programme is helping police officers give better support to women and children. In Colombo, we are continuing to support efforts to address the stigma suffered by survivors of sexual violence. Let me assure noble Lords, communities and individuals that tackling stigma is an important step on the road to reconciliation. It is a priority for our Government and our Prime Minister. As the Prime Minister?s Special Representative on Preventing Sexual Violence, I am proud that we are able to provide vital support in this key area.
However, as my noble friend Lord Sheikh underlined in his thoughtful contribution, despite the progress we should not forget that there is more still to do. As I have already illustrated, we welcome the progress made by the Sri Lankan Government to address the legacy of conflict and to promote reconciliation across all Sri Lanka?s communities. I also underline that the UK Government are fully supportive of those efforts, but <U+200B>it is clear that the Sri Lankan Government need to do much more?a view echoed in the UN High Commissioner?s report.
My honourable friend the Minister for Asia and the Pacific, Mark Field, met Foreign Minister Tilak Marapana in Colombo earlier this month. At that meeting, and in the UK statements at the March Human Rights Council, we welcomed the progress made so far and urged the Government of Sri Lanka to provide the determined leadership required to fully deliver their commitments. My noble friend Lady Berridge and the noble Lord, Lord Collins, also referred to recent events, including the refuge that was attacked while protecting Rohingya Muslims.
Although we have not specifically raised the issue of Rohingya Muslims and that particular attack, it remains, thankfully, an isolated incident and we are encouraged, as noble Lords have acknowledged, by the condemnation by the Sri Lankan Government in this respect.
My noble friends Lord Naseby and Lord Sheikh talked about the numbers killed. While the differential may remain, what is undisputed is that a number of civilians died in the final stages of the war and there are still serious allegations of human rights abuses against both the Sri Lankan military and the Tamil Tigers. The UK has supported the commitment that Sri Lanka has made to the UN Human Rights Council as the best way to establish truth-seeking transitional justice, restitution and reconciliation, which several noble Lords alluded to.. We are encouraged that the Government are focusing on five steps which, if implemented together, could create a virtuous circle, enabling the conditions for stability, growth and long-term prosperity for all Sri Lankans, a point emphasised by my noble friend Lord Sheikh. The five steps are: first, to deliver meaningful devolution through constitutional reform; secondly, to establish credible mechanisms for transitional justice, a point well made by the noble Lord, Lord Collins; thirdly, as the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, touched on, the importance of ensuring that all remaining private land still held by the military is returned to those who own it; fourthly, to replace the Prevention of Terrorism Act with human rights compliant legislation?my noble friend Lady Berridge and the noble Lord, Lord Collins, focused on this?and it is important that human rights compliant legislation protects the rights and freedoms of all communities; and finally, to develop a comprehensive and time-bound strategy to implement the further progress required.
I turn to some of the questions raised during the debate which I have not yet picked up. First, on the freedom of religion and belief programme, let me assure my noble friend Lady Berridge that all forms of extremism are, as she knows, condemned by our Government, whatever the basis. There are those who hijack noble faiths but it is always important to make clear that we do not blame the faith. Rather, we must universally condemn those who use a perversion of faith for their own ends. They do no service to their own faith or to humanity. She also asked about the funding of programmes. As part of our overall funding assessment we are looking at various programmes within the context of freedom of religion and belief, and we will announce our decision in the near future.<U+200B>
The noble Baroness, Lady Cox, talked specifically about women?s rights. In February 2017 Sri Lanka?s eighth periodic review for the United Nations Convention on the Elimination All Forms of Discrimination against Women welcomed progress on legislative reforms and policy frameworks, including the establishment in Sri Lanka of a National Commission on Women. More work needs to be done on gender equality. I will be focusing on this in my responsibilities at the Foreign Office. I am sure that the noble Baroness would acknowledge the role of Joanna Roper, the Foreign Office Special Envoy for Gender Equality.
My noble friend Lord Sheikh rightly raised the issue of economic growth and the need to look forward. I agree that the economic situation in Sri Lanka is improving. We are delighted to see growth forecasts of more than 5.5%. It is heartening that exports from the UK to Sri Lanka also increased in 2015 and exports from Sri Lanka to the UK currently stand at ?1.1 billion. The UK supported Sri Lanka?s reaccession to the EU GSP+ preference scheme in May of this year. I assure noble Lords that we aim to maintain GSP+ benefits for all beneficiary countries at the point of our separation from the EU. This is one debate where I was not specifically asked about the implications of Brexit, but I thought I would mention them anyway.
On the important issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, of security commitments, the Sri Lankan Government have made a number of commitments on security sector reform under Resolution 30/1. Police compliance with human rights norms has also improved and abuses are being focused on, including enforced disappearances. However, as he and other noble Lords acknowledged, much more needs to be done including the replacement of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, to which I have already alluded.
Much progress has been made, but an area which the noble Lord, Lord Collins, underlined in his contribution is what has been done to protect LGBT rights. I assure the noble Lord that the UK remains strongly committed to promoting LGBT people and their rights wherever they live in the world. The UK has provided support to the Sri Lankan Government and the Sri Lankan LGBT rights NGO, working to promote equal rights and to lobby against discrimination. I further assure him that we have raised with the Government our concerns about the increase in nationalist campaigns that targeted religious minorities, to which my noble friend Lady Berridge alluded, and LGBT groups. We also joined the EU statement calling for an end to all forms of discrimination.
A process of constitutional reform began in March 2016. It represents an important opportunity for Sri Lanka to improve human rights protections, and we will continue to monitor the situation very closely. Under Sri Lanka?s current coalition Government there exists, as we all recognise, a historic window of opportunity to build a lasting peace. Meeting the commitments made in Resolution 30/1, including on reconciliation, will be essential to making this happen. Progress has been made, and the benefits are already being seen and enjoyed in Sri Lanka. It remains our view that full implementation of the resolution will require a concerted effort from all parties in Sri Lanka. The President of Sri Lanka has stated that he is committed to creating that environment and climate. I assure him, noble Lords and Sri Lankans?irrespective of their background and community and including the rich diaspora which makes up the British Sri Lankan community?that the UK Government will continue to encourage and support these reforms.<U+200B>
I thank all noble Lords once again for their detailed and thoughtful contributions to this important debate, and my noble friend Lord Naseby for tabling it.

Will act against doctors who work to inconvenience patients: Thalatha
	
The government will act in a responsible manner in future with regard to State doctors who are engaged in strikes that inconvenience patients, Foreign Employment and Justice Minister Thalatha Atukorale said recently.
Minister Atukorale said that several people were acting as if the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) was established as a result of an initiative of President Maithripala Sirisena.
?A huge issue has been made out of the SAITM by several parties which has greatly inconvenienced the people. The main issue that has been brought up in this regard is that a loan of Rs. 3 billion was received from the Bank of Ceylon (BOC) to run the institution,? she added.
She said that State sector doctors were engaged in private practice in the evening without attending to their duties at government hospitals and added that the standards of this profession had gone down due to such activities.
She said that the doctors who were part of this conspiracy were invariably working according to a political agenda and as such the government would take responsible measures in future to defeat it. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
