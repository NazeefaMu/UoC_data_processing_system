They overstep bounds of ethics in the battle for vacant chairs
	
It is a long established tradition that the second in command in the army succeeds the commander when the letter retires from service. ?However, given the unusual situation where the post of the second in command in the army has already been vacant for some time, the bigwigs concerned are said to have short-listed four candidates for consideration by the appointing authority.
?
? The short list is now lying on the desk of a very high political authority, they say.?
While a study is being made at the official level with a view to selecting the most suitable candidate, a no holds barred battle over the chair due to fall vacant has broken out behind the scene, they say.?
The battle has gone down to such an indecent level, that each ?hopeful is said to be unhesitatingly using every weapon in his armoury against his rivals and ?even irrelevant matters like ?extra-marital affairs, caste differences and ?upcountry and low country distinctions ?are also being shamelessly bandied about, they say.?
Meanwhile, some highly concerned yahapalanaya high ups have warned the powers that be that given the backbiting and intrigues going on behind the scene, the government should lose no time in appointing permanent occupants to all vacant high chairs in the state services.

UNHR Chief malicious, unfair: GL
	
The Statement made by the UN High Commissioner of Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al-Hussein at a media briefing held in the last day of his four-day Sri Lanka visit, on the judicial process into alleged war crimes committed by Sri Lankan tri-forces was malicious and unfair, Joint Opposition?s expert spokesman G.L. Peiris said today.
He said that the ?motive of the UN High Commissioner was not to prevail justice and equity for the victims, whose human rights have been violated, but to fulfil certain political agendas,? he said.
?In his statement wrapping up his four-day visit, the UNHR Chief has insulted Sri Lankan tri-forces, judicial system and the sovereignty of the country,? Peiris said.
He questioned as to what kind of proof caused the UNHR Chief to come to a conclusion that an investigation was a must into the alleged war crimes.
?According to sources, the report of the UNHR Chief was based on the evidence gathered from anonymous witnesses and therefore, the reliability of the evidence against a reputation of a country seems to be unclear,? Peiris said.
He said that President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe should have a clear stance on the UN resolution and the implementation of its proposal in the country without making contradictory statements with regard to the issue.
?When other countries, including the United States of America (USA) are openly violating Human Rights by carrying out military exercises in war torn countries, where thousands of innocent civilians are killed, UNHRC?s strange concern on the alleged Human Rights violations in Sri Lanka is a point to be noted,? he said.
Meanwhile, Prof. Tissa Vitharana charged that Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera prevented representatives of the Joint Opposition meeting UNHRC Chief Zeid Ra'ad Al-Hussein. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Bureaucrat stands up to bullying political authority
	
?
A certain purohita wanted to shift a branch office of a leading state-owned financial establishment functioning in a distant area in the country to a building in the same area belonging to one of his political supporters. This financial establishment comes under the purview of the Ministry that the political authority is in charge of.?
?
The purohita was only concerned about ensuring a source of lucrative income to his political henchman and there was no justification for the proposed shifting of the branch office.
The political authority ordered the chairman of the state-owned financial establishment to make arrangements to move the branch office in question to the proposed new premises.
The chairman found on inquiries made that carrying out the political authority?s order meant moving the branch office from the heart of the town where it was centrally located to a less accessible place several kilometers away. He also learnt from the branch manager that the proposed shifting could lead to a total collapse of the flourishing business of the branch office. Given the findings militating against the proposed relocating of the branch office, the chairman ignored the order by the political authority. He also informed the political authority of the dire consequences of the move proposed by him.
Nettled by the chairman?s reply, the political authority had told him: ?You are working under me. You have to follow my orders. Relocate the branch office to the new premises I proposed without further delay.?
However, the chairman had replied: ?You are a politician and I am the head of a state-owned establishment. ?It?s my responsibility to safeguard the interests of the establishment which I am expected to run. ?Therefore, come what may, I am not going to shift the branch office even an inch from where it is now.??
The political authority had rung off after making the angry retort: ?Hm! You will hear from me again.? ? ? ? ? ??

Ex-LTTEers refuse rehabilitation
	
Fourteen ex-LTTE cadres, arrested on charges of criminal activities and later granted bail refused to undergo a period of rehabilitation when the case was taken up by the Colombo Additional Magistrate Aruni Artigala today.
TID officers told the Magistrate that rehabilitation was a means of concluding the cases against the suspects.
However Senior Counsel K. Ratnavel appearing for the suspects told the Magistrate that his clients were innocent and they did not wish to undergo rehabilitation.
He said if the prosecution insisted on sending them for rehabilitation his clients would face trial instead and prove their innocence.
The Magistrate observed that if the suspects did not wish to undergo rehabilitation the Court could not subject them for rehabilitation other than trying them for the charges.
He said if the suspects had agreed to undergo rehabilitation at the beginning of the case they would have completed their rehabilitation by now. (T. Farook Thajudeen)

Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera was today further remanded till February 16 by the Homagama Magistrate Ranga Dissanayaka for allegedly threatening Sandhya Eknaligoda, the wife of missing journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda.
Ven. Gnanasara Thera, was granted bail by the Homagama Magistrate on Tuesday (9).
The Ven. Thera was remanded on charges of contempt of court, and threatening Mrs. Ekneligoda. He was given bail on the contempt charge. However, he was re-remanded for allegedly threatening Mrs. Ekneligoda.
Meanwhile, the lawyers appearing for the Thera said the Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act, No. 4 of 2015 was taken to Court proceedings for the first time and this act was not relevant to the case proceedings of the Ven. Gnanasara Thera.
But the aggrieved party claimed it was relevant for the case.
Court proceedings were temporarily halted for about two hours to allow the lawyers of both parties to discuss and come to an understanding, but since there was no agreement when the case continued, the lawyers requested the Magistrate to postpone the case to study the case.
The Magistrate had subsequently postponed the case till February 16, the lawyers said.
The Magistrate had also asked the lawyers to inform him by February 15, what the consensus was, and that regardless of the agreement, the case would be taken up again on February 16. ?
Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnansara Thera was arrested by the Homagama Police, and was remanded on the orders of the Homagama Magistrate till February 9 on January 26.

He confides his concern in the wrong party
	
?
A leading purohita hailing from the Colombo district recently paid a visit to a large factory belonging to a deputy purohita from a political party other than his.
?
While going round the factory, the deputy spoke to the purohita more about the confining the former strongman?s offspring to the state-run lodge pending hearing of the case against him than about the factory itself. The deputy who himself had to spend a brief spell in the state-run lodge in the recent past continued to express his deep concern over the fate of the young member from the former royal family. Then the purohita from the Colombo district said: ?It was some people from your own political party who pressed for action against the young man. ?So you had better convey your concern over this affair to your own party high ups. As for us, we can do nothing about it??

This one is a leading purohita representing the Betel leaf in yahapalanaya. He was once nursing high hopes of becoming the second in command. But the poll results shattered his hopes. Last week this purohita came face to face with his deputy in the House lobby. And they stopped for a brief chat.?
?
?Malli, I swear by my mother that I will not seek re-election again,? the purohita told his deputy. The deputy looked amazed. ?Why have you taken this sudden decision?? he asked. ?This is no sudden decision, Malli,? explained the purohita. ?I have been mulling over this decision for some time. ?Why should I court disaster by contesting again? I will quit politics once this term expires. ?I will either put on my black coat again or find some other work that can keep me occupied.?
The purohita lumbered on after announcing this decision.

A group of Betel leaf deputy purohitas in yahapalanaya the other day visited the former strongman?s second offspring now booked in the state-run lodge at Welikada. ? The livewires behind this move had a hectic time communicating over the phone with the fellow deputy purohitas of the party in connection with organizing the visit. Meanwhile, a big-mouthed deputy of this group got a call over his mobile from a senior purohita who made it to Diyawanna through the wish-fulfilling list after losing at the last poll.?
?Why are you all planning to do this mad thing, Malli?? the senior purohita was saying.
?What is the mad thing you are referring to?? a surprised deputy asked.
?Aren?t you all now planning to visit that one at Welikada??
?Yes, Aiya,? replied the deputy. ??We are getting ready to visit him. That reminds me?We visited you too when you were there!?
?Yes. That?s true! But Lokka is very angry about what you are going to do. He scolded you all for planning this mad thing!? said the purohita.
?He scolded us? When did he scold us???
?He was really shouting in anger? He might react in a worse manner! So you had better think twice before making this visit. I am telling this for your own good with the best of intentions.?
The deputy seething with anger exploded: ?Aiya, stop telling lies! We are all now at a conference with the Lokka. You are trying to take the entire country for a ride!? The purohita immediately went off the line.
The irony of the situation was not lost on the deputy either. For the purohita who was using his persuasive powers on him was incidentally the one who had been playing an active role to bring about a reconciliation between the Big Two of the Blue party!

He had suggested in the same breath that an outsider be appointed to the post. ?However, the purohita in charge of the subject had rejected these suggestions and added that he would act in the matter of making this key appointment giving due respect to the time-honoured norms and traditions. ??If I am not allowed to act in the manner I want, I would rather quit this portfolio,? the purohita vowed, they say.

I was threatened with death: Speaker
	
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said that an anonymous caller had threatened him with death unless he recognised the joint opposition MPs as a separate group within Parliament.
"It is essential to resolve matters without resorting to disruptive acts and using force, and I must inform the House that someone called me on Tuesday night and told me that I would be killed if I failed to recognise the joint opposition MPs as a separate group," he said.
Mr Jayasuriya requested that the joint opposition MPs discuss the matter with the president. He said it was the SLFP which had a problem and that the opposition MPs should resolve it within the party. He said he would have no problem with recognising joint opposition as a separate group if matters were resolved within the party .
MP Dullas Alahapperuma said an inquiry should be carried out to find out who had threatened the Speaker with death.
MP Wimal Weerawansa said the Speaker should not worry about issues within political parties and only decide whether to recognise the joint opposition as a separate group.
The matter came up when MP Dinesh Gunawardane raised a point of order stating that the issue of the joint opposition should be resolved without delay. He said the matter had been hanging fire for five months without a settlement.
MP Bandula Gunawardane said the joint opposition did not want the opposition leader's post. He said that the issue was that the group had not been given the right to raise questions under Standing Order 23(2) and move adjournment debates.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said matters could be resolved through a committee.
Mr Gunawardane said there should be a time frame within which the committee should come up with its recommendations.
It was decided that a committee would be appointed when President Maithripala Sirisena completed his tour of Germany. The time frame and other criteria were to be decided after the president's return. (Yohan Perera)

No need for any int?l investigation: JHU
	
The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) said today there was no need for an international investigation into alleged war crimes during the last stages of the armed conflict because the current government had re-established democracy, good governance and the rule of law.
JHU western provincial councillor Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said any allegations of war crimes should be investigated through a domestic mechanism because all State institutions under the new government were functioning without political intervention.
?We don?t need an international investigation, foreign judges or technical assistance from western countries because we can resolve all concerns through a domestic mechanism. Today we have independent judiciary, the rule of law and democracy unlike during the Rajapaksa regime,? he said.
He said it was in the aftermath of the international community losing faith in our judiciary and independent institutions that they demanded an international inquiry during the previous regime.
?Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa failed to implement the recommendations of the commissions established to probe war crime allegations but repeatedly acted to neglect the international community resulting in tarnishing the image of the country,? he said.
Mr. Warnasinghe said ex-president Rajapaksa was engaged in achieving political ends through this issue just as he did in the past.
He told a news conference that if an inquiry was held to probe alleged war crimes, action should be taken against the ex- LTTErs who committed war crimes, assassinated political and religious leaders and caused huge destruction to State property. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Leader of the Opposition of the Matale Municipal Council, Daljin Aluvihare, said rumours that the sticker ? Sinha-Le? pasted on trishaws and many other vehicles was an act instigated by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, would tarnish the image of the former president.
He told the monthly meeting of the municipal council yesterday that a group of politicians who were out to arouse communal feelings, were responsible for such short-sighted acts but the fault was attributed to the former President.
?I am an honest politician who respects former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who is the fittest to rule the country. I respect him just as I respect my father. I am not scared of Maithri or Ranil. Former President Rajapaksa, during his visit to Matale, paid a courtesy call on my mother. Those around him paved the way for his downfall and continue to do so. Trishaw drivers paste the ? Sinha- Le? sticker on trishaws under the impression that it was a movement of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. He lost the votes of many Sinhalese and Muslims at the presidential election due to such short-sighted acts, for which he was not responsible,?he said.

So, we are not ready for any kind of split and we are willing to compete for the next election as a one party,? the Minister said.
He said that the long standing fishermen issue of India and Sri Lanka would immediately come to an end as the Ministry had already taken steps to hold discussions with the Indian Foreign Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj.
