Are the people of Colombo North subhumans
	

Its with utmost distress that I write this letter to your esteemed newspaper with the hope that it will catch the attention of the rulers, who seem to treat the people of Colombo North as sub-human beings. Indeed there is no one to hear the painful stories of the distraught masses, where the poorest of the poor live and die. I have lived in this part of the city for over 60 years and things have never been so wretched 
Let me only point out some glaring debacles: 
1. The road starting from Tobacco Company Junction at Kotahena and going along Aluthmawatha is being dug-up for several months by a company involved in the Water Supply Project. It seems that this company lacks competence to avoid setting off several major and minor leaks all along, of which the Water Board doesnt care a copper cent. So, the good, drinkable water streams, down the roadway, turn the place into a mud hole and cause a great wastage which we citizens have to pay for ultimately. This tragedy has befallen several roads in Kotahena, Mutwal and Mattakkuliya. Further, deep wells have been dug along Aluthmawatha Road, St. James Street, Walls Lane, Madampitiya Road etc. and those involved in the work seem quite helpless and clueless. The areas have become veritable death traps with totally devastated road surfaces. The Mattakkuliya-Farm Road Junction is in a mighty mess with leaks everywhere. Leaks have sprung up in several well-laid roads about which the digging sub-contractors and the Water Board care the least. 
2. Indeed such widespread water collection spots (clean water) make a cruel mockery of the Governments much proclaimed Anti-Dengue Campaign. 
3. Rarely do the Water Board workers (looking pathetically incompetent) try to patch up the one or two leaks after months of disrepair. They dig and then discard the remaining excavated sand and tarred blocks blissfully onto the pavement and vanish (St. Marys Road/Centre Road Section). Or, they dump the stuff at the entrances to the by-lanes.

Farm Road

Leaks have sprung up in several well-laid roads about which the digging sub-contractors and the Water Board care the least

4. Just travel along Aluthmawatha Road or several other roads in Colombo North. The dug out sand, stone and other debris are thrown along the pavements giving rise to enormous dust clouds, seriously polluting the breathable air - making everyone suffer from eye, throat and chest problems. 
5. Now comes the stunner! The Electricity Board too has been engaged in the digging done with a vengeance with scant regard for what lies underneath. The result is that, all along the roads, pipelines are broken, sending out gallons of precious water. These rivers then flow for several days, at times for weeks, until the Water Board sends its nondescript team. It seems that the Electricity Board is readily absolved of their wanton destruction. 
6. Samata Sarana is a school and a home to 400 inmates from pre-school kids to very elderly people. The disaster is hellishly apparent opposite this great institution, which was once visited by Secretary Hilary Clinton. The children and the elderly have to wade through mud holes or walk along bathed in dirt and dust. Thus, we see the numb rules treating these helpless citizens like sewage rats. 
7. One positive aspect of our benevolent rulers is the modernized roadway which was commissioned from Mattakkuliya Farm Road, along Centre Road, stretching for 1km or more. The company that carried out this mega project should be complemented. All lamp posts are ready for use. For more than a year now this road remains unlit. Is this a dark side of efficiency 
8. My plea to the rulers is this; follow the example of Patali Champika Ranawake, on behalf of the hapless people of Colombo North. Tie up your shoe laces and walk along the roads and lanes of this part of the city. You can transform the tragedy that has been highlighted, into a resounding victory within a week; as the Ranawake did. But with the shabby mind set of the rest from top to bottom the much hyped dream of a megapolis will only end up as a Necropolis (a place where dead people are buried). To translate the ideas of a megapolis to reality, technical and managerial competence backed by a sincere political is a sine qua non. 

Aluthmawatha Road

So, the good, drinkable water streams, down the roadway, turn the place into a mud hole and cause a great wastage which we citizens have to pay for


9. People witnessing these unfolding and increasing disasters in the North of the city, as never seen before post independence incidents, would like to know whether there are subject Ministers assigned to each of the failed and failing Boards, Local Bodies and Departments (including the Environmental Police) to ensure that there is - some semblance of governance leaving aside the much hyped Good Governance
10. Oh! If only the attention of the Prime Minister and the President could catch a glimpse of this letter!

Bhava and Harasara Pranama   Of craft and homage
	
Ranjith Rubasinghe, who occasionally acts (even now) but is better known to those in his field as an Assistant Director, was born in Akuressa, Matara to a father who operated as a peon by day and an amateur playwright by night. He could sing, he could act, he could craft, he recalled some months ago, at my house.
The fathers passion for theatre had naturally trickled down to the son, and soon enough young Ranjith and his friends were helping him with the choreography and the sets.
Lighting was a problem back then, so we went for the simplest combination: Petromax lamps and coloured paper. I was bewildered, which is why I asked him how. He replied, Depending on the characters and the mood we wanted to convey, we were given cues to change the coloured paper to green, red, or yellow.


I fervently believe that no art form can survive for long without a proper grasp of both the technical and the artistic. Its the same story in both theatre and cinema: you need imagination and craft just as much as you need technicians. Rubasinghe grew up to be a technician himself, but that love for relating stories, for conveying a mood by resorting to the simplest method, turned him in later years into a director on his own accord. Theres a lesson to be learnt here, obviously, which is why, to me at least, the dichotomy between those who think and those who do remains one of the most simplistic and destructive today. Nowhere is it more simplistic and destructive than in the theatre, the most ritualistic, and at times primeval, of all art forms.
The gap between English and Sinhala theatre is so patently wide that it merits an entire article to itself, particularly with respect to how each is nurtured in our schools. This gap, I will get to next week. For now, though, Im concerned about how a drama society, from a school and from this country, is trying to get its members to understand that point I highlighted above: that for the theatre to thrive, there must be both active participation and a felt, honest tribute and throwback to how it was sustained in the past. In other words, a consistent culture of craft and homage.

The gap between English and Sinhala theatre is so patently wide that it merits an entire article to itself, particularly with respect to how each is nurtured in our schools
On two days over two months, the Sinhala Drama Society of Royal College, Colombo will hold two events that will respectively give back to these two theatrical cultures: on September 25 and 26 with Bhava, and on October 26 with Harasara Pranama. Bhava is, for all intents and purposes, done and dusted. Harasara Pranama is not. Because the one cant be written and sketched down without the other, however, I will write on both. And because neither can be talked about without at least a footnote about the Society, its members, history, and trajectory, Ill write on those as well.
First and foremost, the Society. Online records indicate that it was first established in 1998. Written records, though, indicate an earlier timeframe, with the first play to be directed by the students in school for the National Inter-school Drama Competition staged in 1967 (it would win second place, while the following years play would come first). However, what was considered to be a promising start deteriorated rapidly, and soon enough we come across a break in the Societys history throughout the seventies and eighties, before it was properly revived in, yes, 1998. The first few years thereafter were inconsequential, after which another revival of sorts was brought about by a set of students and teachers in the early 2000s. Its in this context that one should dwell on all the shows, competitions, and skits organised by it at present.
To a considerable extent, those shows, competitions, and skits are rooted in the Societys overriding objective: getting its members to explore the aesthetic parameters of the medium. Theatre is arguably the most live of all art-forms, lets not forget, so naturally, for it to be sustained in any institution, its interest should be kept alive through workshops, training sessions, and rehearsals. Speaking with the current Chairman of the Society, Ayath Withana, I understood that at Royal, such rehearsals, which follow a veritable set of workshops headed by teachers and Old Boys, can last up to the final week before the unveiling of a show. These are obviously nothing if they dont get their participants to carve and to reflect on the past. Bhava seeks to address the former, while Harasara Pranama seeks to address the latter.
Bhava is an exhibition and one that strives to tell those who patronise it, The theatre is as much a product of our labour as it is of our imagination. Thats being crude and simple I agree, but for now its the best way I can sum it up. Begun yesterday and ending today, its reach, so to speak, goes beyond exhibit hours (from 8.00 a.m. to 2.00 p.m.) and venue (the Royal MAS Arena). The fact is that the entire exercise has got its organisers to create, to carve, and so together with various stalls from our universities (especially Colombo and Kelaniya), schools, and even Navy, we can expect a veritable display of masks, shoes, costumes, and other ranga baanda from not just Sri Lanka but also China and Japan (two theatrical cultures which have influenced ours).
I am no connoisseur of the theatre and not being one hinders me from delving into what these boys have done. Suffice it to say, then, that the entire enterprise has made them aware of the intricacies of the medium theyre in. Ayath was quite clear on that point:
Before this the younger children didnt know about spotlighting or set designing or even the different mask cultures in this country. We are questioned on them in the O/Level Drama Paper and are asked, for instance, to come up with a set of dialogues and to identify certain sanniyas with respect to particular masks. So when you get involved in not just studying but also carving them, be they masks or shoes or even costumes, you tend to understand the culture, the story, behind them.

Being able to understand, by default and in the arts, means being able to value, to remember, to reflect. Thats what Harasara Pranama has been organised for
Being able to understand, by default and in the arts, means being able to value, to remember, to reflect. Thats what Harasara Pranama has been organised for. The history behind it is more recent, and dates back to 2001, when the schools submission for the Inter-school Drama Competition, for some reason, was skewed and downright ignored by certain officials. We felt hard done by, to be honest, Ayath told me.


Three years later, to address what was felt to be an unjust snub, the then teacher-in-charge of the Society, Rathna Lalani Jayakody, mooted and got the students to organise a single event that would; A) award the winners of the schools Inter-house Drama Competition (held earlier that year); and B) honour two veterans in the field. This was Harasara Pranama (in English, Homage), the first edition of which felicitated Lucian and Malini Bulathsinhala and was held, symbolically, on March 26 (with March 27 being the World Theatre Day). The following year, the number increased to three: Wijeratne Warakagoda, Lalitha Sarachchandra, Somalatha Subasinghe.
Three years after it was first held, the Society inaugurated another event: Abhina, an inter-school competition. It was decided to award the winners at Harasara Pranama as well, until four years later, in 2011, when the teacher-in-charge herself felt that the children were not up to the task of holding such a massive pranama ulela. We faced a lull after that, Ayath told me, It took six years for us to get back. This year, were reviving the show. Were bringing it back. Scheduled to start at six in the evening at the Navarangahala, this edition of Harasara Pranama will as usual pay tribute to three veterans: Ramya Wanigasekera, Neil Alles and Jayantha Chandrasiri.
That lull after 2011 didnt come about for no reason, obviously: the truth is that an event of this sort has to wade through certain constraints that the Sinhala theatre, in general, has to suffer. Its one of the biggest ironies today, but our national theatre finds it more difficult than its English counterpart to get proper, consistent sponsors. Its all arbitrarily and more often than not self-financed. Even for a two or three hour show, we have to spend heavily, Ayath confessed, When our committee decided to organise it, our past Chairmen had one piece of advice for us: come up with three names, then find the money. The first has been easy; the second, so far, has not.
All these observations, illuminating as they are, interest me more for how they reflect the general thrust and philosophy of the Drama Society at Royal. Ever since Rathna Jayakody left earlier this year, the boys have sought to maintain her contribution to both Society and school. She was there for us all, to be honest, helping us find the names, getting the necessary contacts, going out of her way to mould our members to be active participants. Of the 80-odd children we have, only around 20 are active in that sense. Thats rather sad, but to be expected, given the horde of other responsibilities and activities they have to put up with. Thats why both Bhava and Harasara Pranama indicate our efforts to keep Sinhala theatre alive at school.
With about one or two events organised every month, adding up to about 15 or 16 every year, the Society clearly has a lot to maintain. Perhaps what Ranjith Rubasinghe told me, not too long ago, is what drives these boys: in a context where the Sinhala theatre, more than its English counterpart, has to survive on institutional charity and individual effort, we need to nourish it through our schools and our childhood without forgetting that all too important point about an art form, any art form, flourishing through both labour and imagination, both craft and creativity. Perhaps thats one lesson Bhava, Harasara Pranama, and even Abhina will teach us.

Books,  rapture and instant noodles
	
The bargain books section at the annual Colombo International Book Fair is a haven. All the stalls are tucked away well to a side of the centre of all the excitement. They are almost deserted at times and anxious staff actually ask you if there are people in the main hall 
But to get there, you have to zigzag endlessly to avoid knocking into horizontally extended families and clans. On a seamless tropical night, blissfully dry, but for the invisible dew, I got there as fast as I could. Im neither stingy, nor a chronic bargain hunter. Its simply that I dislike crowds, and there are many wonderful books to be had here at bargain prices.  The queen of my treasure trove was Charmaine Solomons Encyclopaedia of Asian Food (original price Rs. 5000 but mine for Rs. 1500 because of a hard-cover jacket with frayed edges). It may sound like a funny choice for a literary type, but I have decided to broaden my horizons. Other treasures included a book of notes on the music of Claude Debussy, a study of the lost art of Sinhalese election verse of the 1930s, and a thriller by Martin Cruz Smith. Except for the encyclopaedia and the thriller, none of the other books cost more than a plate of instant noodles. 
Walking back into the madding crowd, heaving gently from side to side, like a boat in a mild sea, due to the ballast in my hands, I felt like a diver with too much nitrogen in the blood. Nitrogen narcosis, a dreaded underwater condition described by Jacques-Yves Coustaud so romantically as Rapture of the Depths, makes you feel giddy, elated or happily confused  common symptoms in any bar room. No wonder I felt elated. My dive into the netherworld of the bargain book stalls, regardless of bottom time, rewarded me with delightful finds from a sunken vessel of printed treasures. 
No place to sit and read
I looked for a place to sit and read. This is a long-standing shortcoming of the book fair; there has never been any shelter provided for readers. Surely it wont kill anybody to put up at least a 20 feet by 20 structure for us to sit and read (with a sign board saying reading room to keep out loafers) but there is a singular lack of imagination about the whole thing, as exemplified by the free cultural show in front of the Sirimao Bandaranaike hall with the principal book stalls. Several young men gyrating clumsily behind an indifferent singer was proof of that. With so much talent awaiting a chance in this country, the organizers are brilliant at picking the worst! 
I found a perch outside the SB hall and began wondering why I had picked up the recipe book. Then it struck me  the book fair is really about eating, and this sort of thing can have an insidious effect on anyone. This book is a learning experience, of course. Being an Asian and living in Asia all my life, I still dont know many of the edible plants, leaves and herbs listed in it. Leaving it aside for later reference, I picked up the book of poems by William Butler Yeats. 
A prayer for my daughter by Yeats was studied in the Advance Level poetry class. After Donne, Keats and Shelley, he sounded dour, and I didnt read anything by him after that. Now, after a regrettable break of almost forty years, I rediscovered the poetry of his later years, full of a sombre and melancholic music, with pleasure. 
A glance around me, however, showed that no one else was reading. During my many meanderings through successive book fairs at this venue, I have rarely seen anyone reading. When we buy a book, we can hardly wait to get home to read it. I used to read them in the bus. Reading now perched on hard cement, I felt the odd man out. There was something wrong here. 
Everywhere, people were eating instant noodles, washing it down with tea or Nescafe. Or they were having ice cream. I have nothing against gastronomical delights, but when you see ice cream cones rather than books in peoples hands, you feel deflated. Its a safe bet that people on average spent more on food and drink than on books. 
Books vs ebooks
Over the past two decades, many people believed that books were fast heading for extinction given the ebook and social media onslaught. Celebrated bookshops began closing in the developed world. But today, we know that books are here to stay. Theres a reading revival in the West, and more print books are published all over the world than ever. 

Over the past two decades, many people believed that books were fast heading for extinction given the ebook and social media onslaught

The print medium wasnt threatened in the same way over here despite the new generations preference for electronic media (how many ebook readers are there, anyway). The book fair should be proof that the printed book still reigns supreme, but what you see is hardly reassuring, and you end up wondering if most people read anything at all. 
There were parents and children carrying bags of books. Its an educated guess that the bulk of books sold were educational and stationery. No publisher has ever revealed just what percentage of their sales come from fiction, non-fiction and text books. It would come hardly as a surprise if the latter brings in the biggest profits. 
Organise reading sessions
This view is based on circumstantial rather than empirical evidence. It is backed by deduction and common sense. Someone could prove me wrong, with the proper statistics. Till then, I will hold this view. In the meantime, the fair should organise regular book and poetry readings and hold panel discussions with authors, with giant screens displaying whats going on to those far away from the event. The money should be there; tickets cost Rs. 20 each hence the crowds are massive. Publishers, please do everything possible to make people aware of the fact that writers are valuable. Today, only award winning authors have any value, and this is a poor basis for a viable circle of writers and readers. Publishers have a duty to raise and widen literary interests. Its in their interest, too. 
Local writers critisized 
This applies to English writing as well as Sinhala and Tamil. The chairman of the Gratiaen Panel, speaking at the last awards ceremony, compared Sri Lankan English creative writing with examples hed selected from abroad, such as Salman Rushdies. He said he can think of nothing written here that is of comparable quality. Also, local writers do not research their subjects well enough. He thereby raised an interesting question  do we treat local writing as part of world literature, or we do acknowledge that we have our own standard 
In my own opinion, Sri Lankans should write in English even if they cant write as well as Salman Rushdie. That doesnt render what they have to say null and void, and some day, somebody will get there. The same applies to Sinhala literature. I dont claim to be a wide reader of contemporary Sinhala literature, but my survey, limited as it is, has revealed very little comparable to the linguistic standard (beauty of prose) achieved by writers of the past such as Martin Wickremasinghe or G. B. Senanayake. This doesnt mean that contemporary Sinhala fiction has no value. But there is room for improvement, which means hard work, hard work, and more hard work, including more research. 
A look at what was available this time revealed other problems, too. After all, the principal market at the book fair is for books in Sinhala. Its the majority language. Tamil and English come second. There is no suggestion here that the book fair should be literary oriented (meaning not just literary fiction). Serious literary works are read only by relatively small numbers. 
There is, however, a popular reading culture all over the world based on genres such as romance, thrillers, science fiction, horror, historical romance and fantasy/adventure. There are many books in those categories which are considered to be serious works of literature -- John Le Carre and Martin Cruz Smith in thriller fiction, J. K. Rowling in fantasy/adventure, Arthur Clarke, Frank Herbert and Isaac Asimov in science fiction, Mary Renault in historical romance. But much of the rest is generally pulp  entertaining, but forgettable books. Thousands of such books come out each year and there is a huge market for them in the West and elsewhere. 
Then there are biographies and histories. Both are rare over here. After a thirty year civil war, several military leaders have written highly biased accounts of it. No reliable, unbiased history by any respected historian or journalist is available. 

The English fiction readers over here buy them. One can thereby safely assume a Sinhala and Tamil readership, too, but such books rarely get translated. A few of Dr. Clarkes early books have been translated, but none of his later works. The Dune by Frank Herbert has never been translated into Sinhala. None of Cruz Smiths books have been translated. We are still stuck with Conan Doyle and Bram Stoker. Our translators go for serious literature, which is fine, but a very limiting thing. There is no such thing as a local tradition of thrillers, horror and even historical romance, adding to the problem.
W. A. Silvas Juli Hatha (Seventh of July) and Piyadasa Sirisenas novels such as `Adbhuta Agantukaya (The Enigmatic Stranger) are the only Sinhala thrillers which come to mind. Martin Wickremasinghes Rohini and W. A. Silvas Sunethra and Wijayaba Kollaya are historical romance and adventure novels. How many such works have been written after that Even romances in the calibre of Karunasena Jayalaths Golu Hadawatha arent written any more. In short, the book fair has become an annual outing for the family, and buying school texts and stationary at discount prices while eating instant noodles or buying tea at fancy prices. No one grudges what goes into anyones stomach, but when the ultimate choice is between good books and noodles, and the popular choice seems to be the latter, its time for some hard reflection. 
An attempt to widen the range of available categories might improve reading habits and book sales, even though sellers of instant noodles might still be laughing all the way to the bank at the end of each fair. Once writers and publishers do their work (it isnt done yet), its up to the readers.

CB Governor offers key insights into Vision 2025 at DFCC Banks strategy workshop
	
DFCC Bank organized a strategizing session recently at the Pegasus Reef Hotel, Wattala, where a cross-section of the banks senior staff engaged in interactive and participatory discussions as well as focused strategy discussions for the Banks development in 2018-2020.
The highlights were the sessions conducted by two of the countrys financial leaders  Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy, Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and former Deputy Governor, Dr. W. A. Wijewardena, which focused on the macroeconomic development plans of the Government, as well as the long-term economic and financial sector growth of the country.
Dr. Coomaraswamy, in his address, detailed the Governments new Vision 2025 for the Nation. The Central Bank Governor reiterated the Governments pledge of formulating a comprehensive economic strategy that will help raise per capita income to US$5,000 per year; create one million new jobs; increase foreign direct investment to US$5 billion per year; and double exports to US$20 billion per year. The main strategy to achieve this would be by making Sri Lanka a hub in Indian Ocean, and link it to external markets through Exports.
He went on to explain that a new trade policy, along with an original National Export Strategy, will give rise to a more liberal, simple, transparent and predictable trade regime. Furthermore, he said that he hopes these policy changes will attract more export-oriented FDI, improve trade logistics and boost firms abilities to compete in global markets.
Earlier during the day, Dr. W. A. Wijewardena, former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank spoke about the Governments aim to improve Sri Lankas ranking in the Ease of Doing Business Index by undertaking essential economic reforms while ensuring policies are predictable, consistent and transparent. The good news for the private sector is that Public Private Partnerships are to be used as a driver of economic growth.
Simultaneously there will be an emphasis on education and healthcare services across the country. The country as a whole will march towards a new dawn with the development of physical infrastructure facilities through the Megapolis project, economic corridors, improved transportation facilities, build-operate-transfer models and so on.
The key takeaway for DFCC Bank from both these sessions was that the Government has an ambitious vision to drive Sri Lanka to a high tech and digitalised economy while at the same time keeping focused on grassroots needs with plans to improve agriculture via productivity increases and by linking it to logistics networks.
These insightful sessions proved valuable for the DFCC Bank team during the workshop to focus on future strategy for growth, expansion and consolidation in the short-term as well as in the medium term.
At the end of the highly productive session, an ambitious plan for the growth of the bank was formulated which the senior management is fully committed to implementing across the Bank. The broad plans were presented to the Board of Directors during a special session at the end of the programme.

Detained Myanmar Nationals transferred under Police protection
	
The group of 31 Myanmar Nationals, who were detained at a house of UNHRC in Mount Lavinia, had been taken into the Police custody for their protection, Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said.
He said the refugees who were apprehended by the Sri Lanka Coast Guard officials in April this year were initially detained at the Mirihana Detention Centre.
Later, they were handed over to the UNHRC and the UNHRC officials had detained them at a house in Mount Lavinia.
SP Gunasekara said the refugees arrived from Myanmar were taken into the custody for their protection after a group of monks protested against their stay in the country.
Sri Lanka Coast Guard craft on routine patrol in the Northern waters apprehended the fishing boat transferring the 30 refugees including 16 children, 7 women and 7 men in Sri Lankan waters, off the coast of Kankesanthurai on April 30.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

Expect more rains
	
Hurricanes such as Maria and Irma which caused havoc in the US, the Caribbean and Turkey during the past few days have triggered high winds and heavy rains in the Bay of Bengal region including Sri Lanka, the Department of Meteorology said yesterday.
A department spokesman told Daily Mirror the sea areas in the region and around Sri Lanka will be rough. Heavy showers of up to 75mm have been forecast in the North-Eastern regions of the island.
Hurricanes in some parts of the world are known to trigger high winds and heavy rains in other parts of the world, Met Department sources said but ruled out any hurricanes or storms in this region.
"Fairly strong winds are expected over the country and the surrounding sea areas during the next few days particularly in the Uva and North-Western provinces and in Hambantota, Ampara, Matale, Anuradhapura and Mannar districts. Showers were also expected at times in the Western, Sabaragamuwa, Central and Southern Provinces and in the Kalutara district. The sea area from Negombo to Trincomalee via Kankasanturai and the sea area off the coast extending from Matara to Kalmunai via Hambantota and Pottuvil can be very rough at times with wind speeds of up to 60 to 70 kmph," they said.
Most areas in Sri Lanka had received a moderate rainfall of 40 mm yesterday. (Yohan Perera)

GMOA, Dont Wound the Wounded
	
This article was prompted by the news item published in the DM of September 22 under the headline: GMOA Claims Strike a Success. 
The yard stick used by government doctors or the GMOA to gauge the success of Thursdays 24-hour countrywide strike action or work stoppage appears to be the degree of misery, agony and inconvenience inflicted on helpless patients, who queue up at government hospitals from the break of dawn seeking treatment and relief for their ailments, having to return home, most of them in remote villages, disappointed, dejected and depressed, often getting back long after dusk with little or no money to afford another trip to hospital. 
How could anybody, leave alone the GMOA and its learned members,who have sworn the Hippocratic Oath could in their right minds measure the success of their regular and senseless trade union action by how much the people are made to suffer using SAITM as the whipping post. The moot question being asked is where were these now vociferous doctors hiding and why were they keeping their big mouths shut when the Rajapaksa regime helped give birth to the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in 2008 and when in 2013 during former President Mahinda Rajapaksas second term in office, the University Grants Commission bestowed on SAITM the right to award degrees. Not only did the Rajapaksa regime confer scholarships to students to follow the degree course at SAITM but also granted it a Rs.600 million loan from State banks. The thunderous silence then and the street protests, pickets and work stoppages being carried out now underscore the fact that the GMOA is only attempting to fulfil its political agendas and ulterior motives. 
The news item also quotes Ceylon Teachers Union (CTU) General Secretary Joseph Stalin as saying that the work stoppage by the teachers in the protest against SAITM and to highlight the danger posed to the countrys free education system was a success. Once again it is necessary to ask Mr. Stalin whether he too measures the success of the CTU action by the level of disruption caused to academic activities and holding helpless students to ransom by some unscrupulous teachers and principals falling ill or sick.
Where were you Mr. Stalin when SAITM was launched nine years ago, nurtured and allowed to grow to what it is today 
Mr. Stalin must be reminded that free education had lost its flavour with the mushrooming of private tuition classes in every nook and corner of Sri Lanka charging high fees from the thousands of students who attend classes. If free education needs to be protected, then why not protest against these private tuition classes which are spreading across this country on such a large scale 
The other day two boys and two girls entered a bus on the 138 route and claiming to be students of the Jayawardenepura campus began haranguing SAITM and saying that free education was on the verge of being destroyed and that they were on a campaign to safeguard and protect it. Then they went round with tills collecting money saying it was needed for the court cases to be filed against SAITM. The GMOA should not mislead innocent students and drag them out into the streets to be tear-gassed, water-cannoned and baton-charged. If it is a responsible trade union,the GMOA should encourage them to return to their classes instead of wasting their time and the taxpayers money. 
In case there are shortcomings in the quality of medical education at SAITM, the GMOA should discuss these matters with the government and the other stakeholders -- the Sri Lanka Medical Council, SAITM, its students and their parents -- with an attitude of understanding, humility and openness instead of an attitude of arrogance and condescension so that at the final count there are only winners. 

GMOA should not mislead students and drag them out into the streets to be tear-gassed, water-cannoned and baton-charged. If it is a responsible trade union,the GMOA should encourage these students to return to their classes instead of wasting their time and the taxpayers money
In the meanwhile, the government too should act proactively in resolving this contentious issue without vacillating or procrastinating. One positive step is the news that the Government had finalised the long-awaited minimum standards for medical education and would present it in Parliament after gazetting it within three weeks. 
Whatever the cause or reason for the agitation there is nothing so important as to justify the GMOA resorting to trade union action and wounding the wounded who
seek healing.

Low quality cosmetics flooding the market: GMOA
	
The GMOA warned today that there was a rapid increase in the import of toxic substances for facials because of the absence of laws regulating cosmetics in the country.
National Cancer Institute's Consultant Gynecologist Sarada Kannangara said during the past two years cosmetics which include dangerous substances had captured the local market because of the inefficiency of the Health Ministry.
He said clause 27 of the 1990 Medicine Act had been annulled in 2015 and a new Act introduced but it doesnt have sufficient provisions to regulate the import of cosmetic items leaving room for low quality products to be imported.
A wide range of low quality cosmetic products are available under various brand names. Several deaths have been reported because of allergic reactions to these products, Dr. Kanangara said.
He said the GMOA had found that many of these low quality cosmetics had been imported from Pakistan.
He said most of the cosmetics contained mercury above the safe limit for instant results but they more often led to health hazards such as skin cancer. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Men who save the world: The need for moderates
	
Stanislav Petrov might not have had anything extraordinary in his life other than for those few minutes in which he possibly saved the entire mankind from nuclear war. We tend to believe that such a feat is a prerogative of political leaders, statesmen, top military officials or visionaries. But we are wrong.
Petrov was just a Lieutenant Colonel in the Soviet Army manning one of the numerous missile attack early warning stations; this one South of Moscow during the height of Cold War. On the night of September 26, 1983, he was on duty and an alarm started ringing, indicating that an intercontinental ballistic missile has been launched by the US against USSR; he had been trained to alert instantaneously his military superiors who in turn would inform the Top Leadership who would, in all likelihood, order retaliatory nuclear missile attacks on their arch enemy US or its Western Allies.


Yet, Stanislav was a tempered, mature man to realize that the Soviet satellite spying on the US territory could commit errors specially when dusk fell on the missile fields in the US, leading the computers to come to wrong calculations; yet on the monitor it came as a high reliability warning of a launch which heightened the tension he and his team might have felt. Relying on his gut feeling, he informed his superior that although there was an alarm it was probably false. This gut feeling told him that the US would not confine an attack to a single missile if it were intending to attack the Soviets; then the sirens blurted and signaled five launches, but still he informed his superiors over the phone that it was a false alarm.
Afterwards, it was confirmed that had he mechanically conveyed up the alarms as reliable, as he was trained and on orders to do, the top leadership was bound to launch reprisal missiles within minutes, with no time for further verification and under the cold war tension would have meant, probably the Third World War and possibly the extermination of human race from this green planet.
The reason for the false alarm was sunlight reflected on clouds at dusk creating an illusion to the satellite.
Petrov died on May 19 this year, aged 77, his death hardly acknowledged by the media; Western media have at times called him the man who saved the world. When I read his story on the Washington Post recently, I could not help but be amazed by the mature, tempered, instinctive and far-sighted vision of an ordinary soldier, in an extraordinary situation, in ensuring the safety, not only of his motherland but of all mankind. In his mind he was not only aware of the possible technical glitches that might raise alarm, but was wise enough to have a gut feeling that the US was not in hands of leaders who would attack without reason. The judgment of a moderate on one side of the frontline about the restraint of moderates on the opposing side.
Although Petrov was positioned in a chain of command where he did not have the luxury of discretion on nuclear threats to USSR but simply to convey threats to superiors, with whom, was reposed the discretion of reprisals, he did exercise his common sense. This is a quality that is sadly lacking in many national as well as international leaders of present, specially at a time the utter irresponsible and actually fanatic actions by the North Korean leaders as well as highly incendiary and provocative rhetoric by the US President, seem to be flirting with a danger; a danger that the whole of mankind could well do without.
The same applies to the national leadership; few and far between are leaders who could project their vision to long-term prospects of the nation, act with restraint, both verbally and in action, take decisions based on reasoned moderate judgment for the benefit of the larger sections of society and with reliable intuitive ability as to what should be done. Cold sober, restrained and mature in decision-making. In Petrovs case, he called his decision not to report, a gut feeling.
If Petrov were of a maniacal patriotic mindset, which in effect is a misconceived, flawed and dangerous trait, especially among politicians, leaders and military men, the obvious reaction would have been to urge the military leadership to strike back. But he was wise; did not panic; argued with himself, probably in a matter of seconds or minutes the most, that the US would not confine such an attack to one missile; when five was signaled he still believed that it was a hoax and did not urge the superiors to take retaliatory action.
I wish Petrov was a Sri Lankan and a leader, at that.
The North-South divide in our land might seem a miniature figure compared to the Cold War divide between USSR and USA with their allies all entangled in cold war power games, flirting with total annihilation of mankind; yet the distrust, suspicion and coldness with which the leaders eye each other is no less intense. The faintest of remark, the slightest slip of the tongue from the other side seem to inflame the opponents in to racially-motivated heated fury. The Sinhala side does not want the Northern Tamils to sing the national anthem in their own language; they object to the swathes of lands occupied by the military almost a decade after the war, being released to the Tamil civilians; they are hell-bent on not releasing the Tamil youth detained under the PTA. In short, everything that happens in the North arouses suspicion in the South.

We desperately need leaders who would not use the emotional urge of the masses in areas of religion, race and caste 
	The faintest of remark, the slightest slip of the tongue from the other side seem to inflame the opponents into racially-motivated heated fury 
	Everything that happens in the North arouses suspicion in the South


The vice versa holds true with the Northerners. They too are of a mentality that everything done by the Southerners are aimed at depriving them of their right to peaceful living; they believe or tend to declare that the Sri Lankan armed forces have committed war crimes surpassing those of Slobodan Milosevic. They choose to believe that they could guarantee the rights of the Tamils only by pursuing a policy of suspicion and aggression towards theSinhala majority.
The opportunity, the conclusion of the war offered to both parties to get their relations back on track, is rapidly evaporating into thin sky. Looms large the specter of perpetual communal hatred and division. Luckily, both sides are not in possession of missiles, nuclear or otherwise.
If they did, it is very unlikely we would have men like Petrov manning our alert stations on either side; with us are people who would jump to ring alarm bells and provoke reprisals. Wise counsel, moderate insight on national issues as well as objective and rational thinking are things of the past or of foreign origin.
We, as a nation, are in dire need of moderates, people not given to base emotions, impassioned, sober and not in polarised extremes in terms of political, racial, religious lines; those who would be quick not to point out fault lines but potential for compromise; not of provocative conduct but of pacifist tendencies; not hasty to point out the speck in the others eye while having a log in his. Yet, it is exactly the opposite that we have.
Irrational, extremist, polarised and intolerant. From the day we enacted Sinhala only and from the time the Tamil politicians sported Eelam, we have been having our fingers on the hair trigger that could launch destructive forces, that eventually would devour us all, en masse!
We desperately need, on the one hand, leaders who would not use the emotional urge of the masses in areas of religion, race and caste, but act as buffers against those; on the other we need citizens who would not play to the tune of those leaders who ignite base emotions.
I wish Petrov was a Sri Lankan, alive and in leadership! Yet he is not. But there is a silver lining in the equation. We do not have nuclear missiles.
To have them you have to be a powerful, undivided and an efficient nation.
So, a Petrov will not be missed that badly, after all!

President Maithripala Sirisena said that the National Economic Council expects to take immediate steps to stop importing all non-essential and unhealthy food items into the country.
He made these remarks at the opening of the Agricultural Exhibition held at the Training Institute of Department of Agriculture in Bombuwala, Kalutara on Monday.
Addressing the gathering, the President said more than Rs.25 billion is spent annually to import essential food items.
It is essential to produce food required for our consumption in our country. Self-sufficiency in food was the identity and the culture of our country for past thousands of years and it should be protected. It is important that we give value to our products, if we are to help the agriculture economy as well as the national economy, he said.

The presence of Rohingya Muslims who had fled Myanmar was questioned in Parliament today.
Opposition MP Jayantha Samaraweera who raised a question on the issue said a camp comprising of Rohingya Muslims who had come down from Myanmar has been set up near Mirihana. We would like to know what actions the government would take in regard to Extradition Laws, the MP questioned. Mr Samarawerra said this has been reported in social media. Social media has reported on this and it is indeed a reality, he said.
Minister of Justice Thalatha Athukorala who responded said she was not in a position to give any details on it now.
MP Wimal Weerawansa who responded to the Minister said the matter had become a serious issue as some of these people who were in the camp had got out of it and living in private residences. Some of the children of these people have been admitted to schools, he said.
Minister Athokorala said MP Weerawansa could raise a question on the matter from the Ministry of Defence.
SLMC MP M. H. M. Salman who spoke later in the House said Sri Lanka should look at the Rohingya people in a compassionate manner. It is true that Sri Lanka has not signed the UN Charter on refugees but it should look at an issue in a compassionate manner especially as Myanmar where the Rohingya people come from has been a friendly nation. Both countries have worked together in promoting Buddhism and it is essential that this issue is looked at in a more positive manner, he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

He told Daily Mirror the price of lunch packets should be increased and lunch packets should be gazetted as an essential food item.
Lunch packets should be named an essential food item by the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) and should have a controlled price. That control price should be revised according to the price of related items, Mr. Sampath said.
He said a lunch packet should have a minimum standard and it should include three vegetables, a piece of fish and greens.

Ravi K. and Joseph Michael spat: Premier to sort out differences
	
The United National Party (UNP) will have a meeting today to discuss the spat between MP Ravi Karunanayake and former MP Joseph Michael Perera who confronted each other at a youth workshop at Weligampitiya in the Gampaha district during the weekend.
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam told Daily Mirror that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe would meet them at Temple Trees this evening in an effort to resolve this matter.
MP Karunanayake and Mr. Perera had a heated argument when the latter was not given an opportunity to speak at a workshop organized by the partys youth wing Jathika Yovun Peramuna.
Mr Perera said Mr Karunanayake should not be allowed to get involved in party affairs.
Mr Karunanayake accepted that he had done wrong. He has resigned from his ministerial post. His actions have put both the government and the party in difficulty. Why is he allowed to get involved in party matters He is all out to field his henchmen as candidates at the next local government elections, he said
Mr Karunanayake, howvere, denied all allegations and said he was not involved in the youth front meeting. "I was only invited for the meeting. I had nothing to with it. Mr Perera has lost his senses, he said.
Meanwhile, MP Kavinda Jayawardene who organized the event said the programme was only a workshop organized by the National Youth Front and was not a political gathering. I, as the Chairman of National Youth Front proposed to the leader that workshops should be held for the youth prior to the local government elections. I was to invite the party leader. I finally invited Mr Karunanayake who is the Assistant Leader of the party since Mr Wickremesinghe was not available. It was decided that no organizer in the district will be asked to speak at the workshop. However I respect Mr Perera. I would have allowed him to speak had he arrived earlier. Mr Perera came to the workshop at the last moment, he said. (Yohan Perera and Devapriya Chandrasiri)

Seventh Buddhist Summit  World Buddhist Supreme Conference
	
In the modern times of the 21st century, the world is getting increasingly chaotic and effective solution is hard to find. The chain of brutal terrorism caused by religious conflicts and the retaliation has expanded and cannot be stopped. Our earth is on the edge of crisis due to a number of factors. For example, nuclear proliferation and military threats are destructive to peace and stability of the world. Looking at our Mother Nature, excessive consumption of natural resources has led to environmental destruction,and climate change, food crisis, natural disasters, spread of infectious diseases are frequently seen around the world. The earth, the planet on which we all live, is falling into a catastrophic state. Science and technology have developed to a highly advanced stage and humankind can enjoy an affluent life now. However, this critical situation of the world is truly serious and disturbing. 


It is only religion that can resolve the present situation in extreme chaos and bring about peace and serenity. Among many religions in the world, Buddhism we believe in, has firmly upheld its principle of non-violence throughout its history of 2,500 years.
Buddhism is truly the religion of peace that brings about great hope to us human beings. 
Buddhist Summit was founded in 1998 in order to propagate Buddhism by Most Ven. Dr. Kyuse Enshinjoh, the Supreme Patriarch of Thailand, Ven. Chief Prelates of Sri Lanka, and other world-renowned supreme Buddhist leaders in the world, who worried over the state of the world. 
Almost 2 decades have passed since then and the supreme Buddhist leaders of member countries have made every endeavour for propagating Buddhism. As a result, Buddhist Summit has grown from 13 participating countries and 1 region at the First Buddhist Summit to 47 countries across the 5 continents at the Seventh Buddhist Summit. It has become a global-scale international Buddhist conference whose lofty ideals and earnest activities compare favourably with those of the United Nations. During the same period of time, the number of Buddhists in the world has increased from 370 million to 520 million and the number is still increasing. 
A number of goodwill messages have been sent from Heads of State, national leaders, intellectuals, and cultural figures of various countries in the world on the occasion of the Seventh Buddhist Summit to be held in November 2017, with great expectation and attention at the conference hall of Temple Trees, the Prime Ministers residence in Colombo. The country takes pride in its long tradition and high authority in Buddhism. It is tremendously significant in the Buddhist history of 2,500 years that the Buddhist Summit Conference is held as a national event under the auspices of the government of Sri Lanka, a leading country of Theravada tradition, in the presence of President Maithripala Sirisena as the guest of honour. 


In this Seventh Buddhist Summit, it is hoped that the supreme Buddhist leaders from 47 countries across the 5 continents in the world overcome the differences of traditions by reverting to the original teachings of Gauthama Buddha, and share their wisdom, strengthen their solidarity, and advance forward together with strong passion toward the peaceful future through the propagation of Buddhism in the whole world. 
In 2014, it was unanimously agreed at the Sixth Buddhist Summit to designate April 8 as International Buddhist Day, a common festive day for all Buddhists in order to propagate Buddhism into the world. At the Seventh Buddhist Summit, various ways will be proposed for the sake of young people to get familiar with Buddhist principles and practices. Such proposals will surely make a powerful contribution to the further propagation of Buddhism and bring about fruitful results for saving all human beings. 
The Seventh Buddhist Summit which will be held as a national event of Sri Lanka, the country that prides itself with its long history of Buddhism, will become a historic international Buddhist conference where a declaration will be made for strengthening the solidarity and further propagation of Buddhism worldwide for the sake of world peace and serenity for humanity. 
47 countries will participate at
the Summit. They include Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Belgium, Bhutan, Brazil, Cambodia, Canada, Chile, Congo, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Korea, Laos PDR, Malaysia, Mexico, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, Netherlands, New Zealand, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda, United Kingdom, United States of America, Venezuela and Vietnam

SF denies reports on UN delegation
	
Rural Development Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka yesterday rejected reports that he was not included in the UN Delegation headed by President Maithripala Sirisena to New York. The Field Marshal said he couldnt go to the US because his visa was denied.
I could t go to the US because my visa was rejected. This was the third time that my US visa got rejected this year. I was not granted Visa to attend my daughters graduation as well. My green card was also not renewed, he told the Daily Mirror.
Commenting on the remarks of MP Udaya Gammanpila, that Minister Fonseka had been removed from the delegation, the minister said the President had removed the joint opposition and not him.
I was someone who spearheaded to bring the President to power. The President didnt drop me from the delegation. It is the joint opposition which had been cast aside by the President. Gammanpila doesnt know what he is talking about. Maybe the UN is something Gammanpila values, but not me. I simply said my visa was rejected because a journalist asked me, he said.
Meanwhile, he said the Foreign Affairs Minister was also included in the UN delegation but the Foreign Minister asked permission from the President to stay back as the UN visit was almost over when Parliament sessions were completed.
The Minister also publicized the letter sent by the Presidential Secretary on September 13 to him saying that he had been included in the official delegation to the UN. The letter said that the Protocol Division of the Foreign Affairs Ministry would be in touch with the minister shortly.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) yesterday said Foreign Minister Tilak Marapana was included in the UN delegation to New York though he was asked to stay back.

TNA Provincial Councillor M. K. Shivajilingam told the UNHRC in Geneva since Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka- the then army commander- had admitted to the Sri Lankan Army committing war crimes, an investigation should be launched through an international court to probe the charges.
Addressing the UN Human Rights Council sessions in Geneva on Friday, Mr. Shivajilingam said Mr. Fonseka had stressed that he was in possession of evidence that 30 army personnel including former army commander Jagath Jayasuriya had committed war crimes and violated human rights.
He had also said the Tamil people had no faith in the government of Sri Lanka.
We cant expect solutions to the Tamil peoples plights from the Sri Lankan government. No solution had been given to the ethnic problem of the northern and eastern Tamils, which led to the war. The government deceives the Tamils and the international community, he said.
He said the Tamil population in the North and the East contributed immensely to the victory of President Maithripala Sirisena but the plight of Tamil people remained unchanged.
Mr. Shivajilingam said, two days after Mr. Fonseka admitting to having evidence that army personnel had committed war crimes, President Sirisena had said he wont allow an international probe against military personnel.
This is the current status of Sri Lanka. No solution can be expected to the plights of Tamil people from the government. Therefore, we request the UN, UNHRC and the international to intervene to establish an international court to deliver justice, he said. (Siraj Hashim)

The maritime trade route vital for SL: Navy Commander
	
What happens in the Indian Ocean will ultimately affect Sri Lanka which is a small country on the maritime trade route, Navy Commander Travis Sinniah said yesterday.
He said there was competition for the Indian Ocean and major countries such as the US, China and India were interested in it.
"These are challenges that Sri Lanka has to face as we are a small country. We depend on the sea. We can only survive if we can keep the sea lanes open. The challenge is to see that Island is connected by sea without being held to ransom by anybody else, Vice Admiral Sinniah said.
He told a news briefing held at the Navy Headquarters that the Galle Dialogue, the International Maritime Conference, had placed Sri Lanka on on the maritime map.
We have to see that we speak about these things and overcome the challenges in the case of conflict. That is why we need to have conference so that we can form partnerships, we can have cooperation and we can have allies so that Sri Lanka will never be isolated he said.
The Navy Commander said Sri Lanka had always been an Island that people had fought for having known its importance.
"The Indian Ocean has witnessed an unparalleled maritime dangers during the past decade such as proliferation of arms, piracy, human trafficking, maritime terrorism and narcotics trafficking which in turn threaten the stability of the region and pose a great threat to Sea Lines of Communication. In this regard, Sri Lanka Navy played an enormous role for nearly two decades to defeat maritime terrorism and further strengthened the maritime security and safety of SLOCs in Indian Ocean Region," he said.
The Galle Dialogue was inaugurated by the Sri Lanka Navy in 2010 under the patronage of the Ministry of Defence. This years theme of the Galle Dialogue is Greater Maritime Visibility for Enhanced Maritime Security. It will be held at the Gale Face Hotel in Colombo on October 9 and 10.
The purpose of this conference is to provide a common platform for stakeholders of national and international repute to discuss and deliberate maritime related issues.
At least 100 participants from 30 countries including US, China and India will attend the this year conference.(Darshana Sanjeewa)
