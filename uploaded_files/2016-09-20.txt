A boozy top cop a headache to other cops!
	
This top cop from the Central Province, a terror to boozy drivers, has himself been the cause of several road accidents due to being highly soaked, while being behind the wheel.?
?
This top cop, a typical night-time toper had once rammed his vehicle into a three-wheeler and also into a wayside tree and a bus on two other occasions. On all these occasions, he had beaten the rap, thanks to his high office.
However, if a drunken driver is caught during the day-time, this top cop would enforce the law to the letter.?
This uniformed high-up has become a headache to the law enforcement authorities in the Province, they say.

ComBank launches new series of ?Cash Deposit & Withdrawal? machines
	
Commercial Bank of Ceylon (ComBank) has launched a new generation of machines that offers several new advancements on the standard ATMs and deposit machines, including cash deposits that are credited instantly.
Sri Lanka?s largest private bank said it will be installing ?Cash Deposit & Withdrawal? machines in stages within its 251 strong branch network.
Card-less cash deposits are possible and the new machines accept cash deposits into third party accounts as well. They can be used to settle utility bills and dues on ComBank credit cards, the bank said. A sophisticated stacker that can accept and count up to 200 notes at a go eliminates the need for envelopes, making the machines more eco-friendly. Additionally, the new machines offer services such as balance inquiries, transfers of funds between linked accounts and changing of personal identification numbers (PINs) and accept requests for mini statements, the bank said. Detailed receipts are issued in respect of the transactions processed.
?Our continuing focus on technology is driven by our commitment to make transacting more convenient, more efficient and safer for our customers,? ComBank Managing Director/CEO Jegan Durairatnam said.
?These new machines represent a significant advancement in functionality and versatility and enhance our offering in 24x7 banking services.?
In 2015, ComBank commissioned a new generation of automated cash deposit terminals that completely eliminate the use of paper, launching a new Green Banking channel. These deposit machines may also be used to pay dues on ComBank credit or debit cards. They accept four denominations of currency notes ? Rs.5000, Rs.1000, Rs.500 and Rs.100. Soiled or damaged notes, notes of other denominations or foreign currency notes are not accepted and are returned to the depositor via a ?Reject Tray.? Coins are also not accepted.
The bank?s digital banking platform now offers four types of machines for customers to do their banking with ease. The machines are traditional cash withdrawal ATMs, cash deposit machines, cheque deposit machines and the latest Cash Deposit & Withdrawal machines. The bank owns 638 cash withdrawal ATM terminals, the largest network owned by a single bank. Collectively, the bank now owns over 700 terminals for customers to do their banking transactions without entering a branch and filling out forms.

The uproar had occurred, when the politico who unveiled the commemorative plaque, discovered to his dismay that his name was missing from the inscription on it.
?All the VIPs who attended the ceremony had learnt about this glaring shortcoming only after the unveiling of the plaque.
On inquiry, the departmental authorities at the periphery had explained that they did not look into the matter in advance, as they were informed by those above them that the Head Office had taken over the responsibility for making the plaque. ?
Highly affronted, the politico had after the incident cold-shouldered the Head of the Institution and refused even to occupy the seat next to his, reserved for him at the proceedings that ensued.

Govt. trying to outsource administrative power: NFF
	
The National Freedom Front (NFF) said today the Government was on a mission to handover the administrative power of Sri Lanka to a corrupt American company identified as Mckenzie under the guise of handling the country?s special projects management.
NFF media spokesman Mohamed Muzzamil said the Government had planned to hand over country?s special projects management through a Cabinet proposal by way of a contract worth Rs.338 million.
?According to the reports we have received McKenzie is a corrupt company in America. This company was reported as a company which leaks client information to other parties for financial gain,? he said.
Mr. Muzzamil said this company had even leaked confidential information to Raj Rajaratnam, a billionaire who was allegedly involved in money trafficking in connection to the LTTE.
?This company is known to have leaked confidential information of the British royal family to several companies,? he said adding that the Government was responsible to administer the country even though the current rulers have attempted to hand over the country to foreign forces.

JO seeks to get VAT monies collected by Govt. returned
	
The Joint Opposition (JO) today said that it would submit an amendment to the Value Added Tax (VAT) Bill, when it was tabled in Parliament, to return the monies collected from the people following the VAT increase, that came into effect on May 2.
MP Bandula Gunawardane said since the Supreme Court had ruled that it was illegal to charge the increment without Parliamentary approval, the Government should pay what was already charged back to the tax payers.
?It was in this backdrop, the Cabinet approved new amendments to the VAT Bill, to increase the tax to 15 per cent. This proves the fact that the monies which were collected from the masses were illegal. Recently, I witnessed two patients asking for the VAT amount they had paid a private hospital be refunded. One patient had paid Rs. 60,000 and the other Rs, 120,000. The hospital management had informed the patients that they have sent the collected money to the Inland Revenue Department. This amount belonged to the people, not to the government,? the MP told a news conference.
He said they would submit another amendment in the event the government decided to implement the VAT increment with retrospective effect.
MP Gunawardane reiterated that the government could impose a Rs. 20 tax on a cigarette to collect an income of Rs. 82 billion per year. ?Had it gone ahead with this move, the government would not have had to impose taxes on cellular phones used by many who are frequently benefiting from telecommunication service providers and the patients who are receiving treatment at private hospitals,? he said.

MIT Crafts A Way To Read Closed Books
	
Is it possible to read a book without ever opening it? Well, the answer is yes.?
Researchers at MIT and Georgia Tech built a prototype imaging system that can read individual pages in a stack of papers. It?s an early demonstration.
And as the technology improves, it could someday give, say, museum curators, another tool to study ancient, fragile books they wouldn?t dare open.
According to MIT news, to peer through stacks of paper, the system relies on terahertz radiation, which is a frequency band of electromagnetic radiation that falls between microwaves and infrared light.?
Terahertz imaging systems emit short bursts of radiation that can penetrate a variety of materials. Substances such as water, plastics, gases and biofuels absorb specific terahertz frequencies, which makes it easy to identify them.
NASA used the technique to inspect foam insulation structures on its shuttle fleet, and it?s the same technology used in full body scanners at the airport.?
Researchers used a standard terahertz camera to blast radiation at a stack of 20 papers with a single letter printed on each, and a sensor detected the reflected radiation.?
So far, the system can penetrate and interpret the top nine pages in a stack of 20 ? the signal looses energy the deeper it goes, resulting to too much noise. But as the relatively young technology improves, it?ll be able to dive deeper.
The very fact that it's a possibility is exciting, however. Historians could read books that they're too afraid to touch in the first place without worrying about wear and tear.
With this news, it doesn't mean you'll be reading fragile manuscripts any time soon. But hopefully the system will get improvements by the time. Future is bright as we?ll be able to read closed books.?

With regard to the death of a man while in the custody of the Pussellewa Police, Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake told Parliament yesterday that there had been a lapse on the part of the police when it came to the checking of inmates at regular intervals.
