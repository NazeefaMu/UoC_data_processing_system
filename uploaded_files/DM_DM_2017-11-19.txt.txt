Mumbai Indians likely to release Malinga for IPL auction
	
In what would have seemed an unthinkable move a few years ago, IPL side Mumbai Indians are set to release their premier fast bowler in history, Lasith Malinga, for the IPL auctions, the Indian media reported.
With the teams likely to be allowed to retain a maximum of three players, the IPL 2017 winners are unwilling to keep hold of Malinga, considering the fact that the Sri Lankan speedster has looked out of form and also faced issues regarding his fitness off late.
Mumbai Indians though will still have the option to pick the 34-year-old during the player auctions - a move the franchise is not ruling out.
"As per the rules, Every team can preserve maximum four to five players, Mumbai Indians team management is on the opinion to release the Slinga Malinga," a source, close to Mumbai Indians told Cricket Age.
"The Mumbai Indians can also buy him back, but as far as the auction is concerned, it looks like Lasith Malinga will find himself in the pool of players up for grabs" the source revealed further.
Malinga is the most successful bowler in IPL history with 154 wickets from 110 matches and played a key role in Mumbai Indians victorious campaigns in 2013 and 2015 picking up 20 and 24 wickets respectively.
However, Malinga was off-colour in the 2017 IPL campaign picking up just 11 wickets from 12 matches as well conceding runs at an expensive 8.84 runs an over.
While there is no doubt that Malinga is by far the most successful bowler in IPL history, be it with his wicket-taking abilities or his death-overs bowling, the likes of Jasprit Bumrah and New Zealand's Mitchell McClenaghan has established themselves as the Mumbai franchise's first-choice bowlers ahead of the Sri Lankan.
Malinga may be head and shoulders above the rest with his enviable IPL record, but there is no denying that the Sri Lankan speedster has lost the pace and the ability to bowl yorkers consistently that had made him one of the toughest bowlers to face in the T20 format.
Age has caught up with the right-arm pacer and an unwillingness to look after his body has played a part in his downfall as a bowler while also leading to many run-ins with the Sri Lankan cricket administration.
It is hardly a surprise that Mumbai Indians has decided to let go off Malinga though they still have the option to pick him up at the auctions at a considerably lower price.

PM before bond commission voluntarily
	
The United National Party (UNP) stressed that its leader Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was to go before the bond commission (PCoI) today to give evidence was not a suspect in the case but would appear before the Commission voluntarily, UNP Senior Vice President Lakshman Kiriella said today.
Mr. Kiriella came out with this statement in response to continuous allegations made by the Opposition that the Government had become helpless as Prime Minister had been summoned before a Presidential Commission for the first time in the history.
The latest allegation came from Joint Opposition MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara.
Meanwhile, UNP Colombo District MP Mujibur Rahuman also stressed that Mr. Wickremesinghe would be going before the commission voluntarily, at a separate media briefing on Saturday.
An Opposition MP was appointed as Chairman of COPE following the Treasury Bond incident. During the former Government, all those appointed to the Committees were Government MPs. When MP Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe was the COPE Chairman, the Government prorogued the Parliament and appointed D. E. W. Gunasekara as the COPE Chairman. It is only under the present government that probes are conducted independently, he said.
However, the opposition is of the opinion that the Government had become helpless with the development of the probe on the bond issue.
Joint Opposition MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardene came out with this notion at the Committee Stage debate on the budget, while MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara said the Prime Minister had been called upon to face the Commission on the bond scam.
JVP MP Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa was of the opinion that Prime Minister Wickremesinghe was directly responsible for the scam for several reasons, such as ordering that the bond issue should be done under direct placement method, as he was behind the appointment of a non-citizen of Sri Lanka as the Governor of Central Bank, taking Central Bank under its purview, appointing lawyers attached to UNP to probe the bond scam, removing UNP MP M. Velukumar from the COPE in the middle of the investigation and filling the vacancy with Deputy Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe, who had already written a book titled Ettha Nettha on the issue and getting Venerable Thiniyawala Palitha Thera of the UNPs Bhiikhu Front to file a petition before the Supreme Court against the COPE Report after the release of the report.

PUCSL warns of power crisis
	
Implementation delays of the long term energy plan over next three year period could very likely trigger a power crisis that could seriously affect the national economy, Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) revealed in its latest report.
In the report which had been handed over to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and to the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy, it said a total financial loss of Rs 50.62 billion is expecting due to the implementation delays of the power plants.
The report said that PUCSL had been continuously monitoring the progress of the CEB in implementing the approved plan and had observed delays in the procurement process of power plants expected to be commissioned by 2020.
Further it said although the Kerawalapitiya 300 MW Natural Gas fired power plant was expected to be commissioned in January 2019 according to the Least Cost Long term Generation Expansion Plans (LCLTGEP), as per the CEB implementation plan it would be commissioned only in June 2020 creating a calculated loss for a month of delay of Rs 1.55 billion.
The report also revealed that as per the CEB implementation plan the plant is going to be delayed for 18 months where the loss would increase up to Rs 28 billion.
Also the report reveals that the 122 MW Uma Oya Hydro plant is expected to be commissioned by January 2019, but the expected commissioning date is not given in the CEB implementation plan. Therefore it was assumed that the plant would be delayed by one year.
As per the LTGEP the expected energy generated from the Uma Oya plant is 290 GWh per annum, if the plant is delayed the substitute energy will cost additional Rs. 22.00 per kWh. Therefore the financial loss for one year is calculated as LKR 6.4 billion. This translates to a monthly loss of LKR 0.5 Billion assuming constant plant factor if the plant would have been implemented. the report said.
The report also concerned over the solar, wind and mini-hydro projects that are to be implemented by year 2018 - 2020 and assumed to be delayed each project by one year because of the implementation delays.
Accordingly a the report had forcasted a total loss of Rs 5.44 billion from three solar plants if the implementations delayed for a period of one year.
Also it calculated an approximate loss of Rs 9.02 associated with delaying of above wind plants while 15 MW mini-hydro plant would be Rs 0.58 billion per year.
Therefore the Commission had recommended to expedite the procurement of listed power plants in the report accordance with the approved schedule, as a matter of national importance.
The PUCSL had rejected the arrangement of purchasing emergency power in the future to meet any capacity or energy deficit due to implementation delays of stated upcoming power plants and urged such costs should not be passed through to the consumers through tariffs.
It said that the government may consider a change in industry structure if the generation plan implementation cannot be efficiently carried out within the current structure. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

UNP says MPs privilege breached
	
The release of information on the phone calls of COPE Members by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) probing the Central Bank bond scam was a breach of privilege of the MPs, Several UNP MPs said.
UNP MP Prof. Ashu Marasinghe told a media briefing Saturday that privileges of MPs had been breached by the divulgence of details pertaining to COPE Members telephone conversation to media during the sessions of Presidential Commission of Inquiry probing the bond scandal.
Professor Marasinghe said a group of UNP MPs, who met the Speaker yesterday drew the latters attention on the breach of privileges of MPs.
As a country which hails democracy, we are of the view that telephone conservations of the MPs should not be tapped or publicised in such manner as it was a breach of their privileges. The Speaker also agreed to look into the breach of privileges, he said.
We could witness as to how the telephone conversations were tapped during the tenure of the former regime. There are accepted telecommunication norms. Telephone or computer data can only be obtained through a Court Order. However, such information should not be exposed to the media until that judicial process is completed.
Even if a court order is issued, the data pertaining to a telephone conservation of an MP can only be obtained with the permission of the Speaker, he said.
While stating that privileges of all 225 Parliamentarians should be safeguarded, he said there should be a proper understanding on as to how Parliaments of other countries act in similar situations.
Both the media freedom and privileges of MPs should be safeguarded. If the information is gathered by tapping telephone conversations, it would have a serious impact on the countrys democratic process, he also said.
UNP Kurunegala District MP J. C. Alawathuwala said COPE took measures to investigate on the Treasury Bond scam and it was decided later to refer the report to the Attorney General.
All the Government and the Opposition MPs extended their support to conduct this investigation. Earlier, there was no occasion ever that a COPE Report was referred to the Attorney General. Therefore, the Government has acted in a more transparent manner. The Government set up series of new Committees, he said
UNP Colombo District MP Mujibur Rahuman said the Prime Minister would voluntarily go before the Bond Commission today to give evidence.
After this Treasury Bond incident, an Opposition MP was appointed to the COPE.
During the former Government, all those appointed to the Committees were Government MPs. When MP Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe was the COPE Chairman, then Government prorogued the Parliament and appointed D.E.W. Gunasekara as the COPE Chairman, he recalled.
Allegations have been levelled against a few MPs in the COPE that they had telephone conversations with Arjun Aloysius. If these allegations are true, then the Government should attempt to defend them. But all MPs in the COPE endorsed that report and referred it to the Attorney General, he added.
Recalling the previous regime he said that the Police was scared to even to arrest a Pradeshiya Sabha member.
Therefore, the credit should be given to the incumbent Government for creating this new political culture in the country. Whether it is right or wrong, today media has the freedom to openly discuss and report it, he said. (Yohan Perera)
