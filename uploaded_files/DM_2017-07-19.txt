Aerobic exercise and arthritis
	
Query: I find Dr Himantha Athukorales articles the most informative possibly because there are family members suffering from joint diseases. Could you please explain the condition of synovitis.
Thanks and regardsMrs. S. Dias Amaratunga 
Nugegoda 
Answer: Thank you very much. I will briefly explain what synovitis is. The word synovium is used to describe a covering that is present around most of our joints. This is a thin rubbery cover that is stretchable. Inside the synovium lie two bony ends which rub against each other to form the structure we call a joint. The term  itis is a Latin word to describe inflammation. Inflammation is an extra blood supply to a certain part of the body causing swelling and other problems. So synovitis if simply explained is, extra blood supply to the synovium causing it to malfunction/ cause symptoms. Synovitis is the hallmark of of a condition called inflammatory arthritis. I hope I answered your query. 



Answer: Thank you very much for the query on aerobic exercise and rheumatoid arthritis. Theres abundant research evidence to suggest that exercise can improve joint function and range of motion. Aerobics can also change how the brain perceives pain.Therefore it reduces the symptoms markedly. 
There are a variety of lifestyle modifications that are taught for people with all forms of arthritis. I used to help a class, meant for patients, named Tools for life in the United Kingdom. All were taught how to perform simple tasks like reaching out for higher objects, climbing stairs, using a walking stick, opening a lid etc.. I strongly feel that this is a must for Sri Lankan patients as well. 
Blood cholesterol levels and rheumatoid disease correlate strongly. Unfortunately the major cause of debility and even demise in rheumatoid arthritis worldwide is cholesterol related blood vessel disease. This leads to things like strokes and heart attacks. So a blood cholesterol test for all patients with arthritis is mandatory. I hope these answers were useful. 
Query: I would like to know from Dr. Himantha Atukorale about the health benefits of aerobic exercise and the lifestyle modification for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. I would also like to know how high cholesterol can affect rheumatoid arthritis. Thank you

Chewing betel with tobacco and arecanut banned from today
	
Using tobacco and arecanut in betel quids apart from smokeless Tobacco Products and mixtures that contain tobacco would be banned from today, Centre for Research in oral cancer Director Prof W.M. Tilakaratne said yesterday.
While addressing media at the Government Information Centre yesterday Prof. Tilakaratne said a gazette notification had been issued on September 1, 2016 in this regard and according to its update manufacturing all smokeless tobacco products, selling, keeping in possession and import would totally be prohibited.
This law will be implemented further to banning tobacco products such as Babul, Pampara, Bita and etc in the country.
It was reported that the incidence of oral cancer among tobacco and arecanut chewers is five-fold compared to non-users of them. They are the major causes of oral disease, other systemic conditions, disability and death, according to reports.
Arecanuts had been certified as the main cause to oral cancer by the reports prepared by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Therefore a Bill was passed in Parliament under which, the gazette notifications have been issued, Prof Tilakaratne said.
The Health Minister has also issued regulations prohibiting the manufacture, importation, and sale of e-cigarettes containing tobacco, and cigarettes that are flavoured, coloured, or sweetened under this law, the National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol Act, in 2016. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Children take school garbage home
	

The garbage disposal in the city has become an explosive issue. However, a super-school in the city  one close to Borella  has hit upon a novel method of disposing of the school garbage.

The task of removing the waste collected in the class room has been assigned to the children themselves! Children are placed on a roster for the purpose and every child is required to collect the days garbage in a bag when his turn on the roster comes and take it home after school for disposal.
Children of this school carrying garbage bags along with their school bags are drawing objections and caustic remarks from school van drivers and bus conductors these days, they say.
The solution to the garbage problem found by the school has aggravated our garbage problem at home, a highly concerned parent said. Its pity even supposed to be educated people are also resorting to patchwork solutions, he added.

Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan, who is also the leader of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) said the UNP and the SLFP must put aside their petty political agendas join together to ensure the success of the constitutional-making process.
He said it was essential for the two parties to take collective decisions so that the country would have a Constitution, based on a national consensus.
This is an urgent need for the country, Mr. Sampanthan said during a meeting with Singapore's Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan in Colombo on Tuesday.
The TNA Leader apprised the visiting Foreign Affairs Minister of the current political situation with regard to the Constitutional-making process and stressed the need for continuing with the Unity Government to bring this process to a successful end.
Referring to the issues faced by the Tamil People in the North and East, Mr. Sampanthan highlighted the slow progress in resolving the relevant issues. He said the Northern people were requesting for a process which would ascertain the truth, and that this appeal could not be delayed any longer.
Mr. Sampanthan welcomed the efforts by the Singapore Government on promoting investments in Sri Lanka and requested the visiting minister to give priority to programmes which would provide skills development and employment opportunities to the young people in the North and East.
The Foreign Affairs Minister appreciated the efforts of the Opposition Leader and noted that his role as the leader of the Tamil National Alliance was a difficult task. I salute you for your courage and perseverance, he added.

Day of Rage declared as 50 injured at Jerusalem holy site
	

DPA, 18th JULY, 2017- President Mahmoud Abbas Fatah party has called for a Day of Rage as 50 Palestinians were wounded in overnight clashes with Israeli police near a Jerusalem site holy to Jews and Muslims, the Red Crescent reported on Tuesday.

Fifteen of the injured had been hit by rubber bullets, the Red Crescent said.
The Day of Rage is set to take place on Wednesday over new security measures introduced at the weekend by the Israelis after police were attacked at the site, known to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary and to Jews as the Temple Mount.
The Hamas and Islamic Jihad movements have also called for protests in the West Bank and Gaza Strip over the new security measures, which include metal detectors and turnstiles at the entrance to the site.
Jerusalem Grand Mufti Mohammed Ahmed Hussein criticized the new measures as altering the status quo, which gives Muslims religious control over the site and permits Jews to visit but not pray there.
The Palestinians fear Israel is trying to retake control of the site by stealth. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stressed on Friday that he did not want to alter the status quo.
The site is sacred to both religions, as it houses the al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock shrine, Islams third holiest site after Mecca and Medina, but also the ruins of the Biblical Jewish Temple. Questions about control of the site frequently lead to outbursts of fighting.
On Friday, two Israeli police officers were killed and another injured after three men opened fire on security officers working at the site. The attackers, believed to be Israeli Arabs, were also killed. Israel then closed off the area, preventing Friday prayers at the al-Aqsa Mosque.

Deafening silence about astounding prediction
	

An offspring of a prominent politico hailing from the South made a sudden visit to the Southern part of the neighboring country recently.

The politico, a purohita at state level is an intimate of a very high authority in yahapalanaya.
The offspring had made this visit to consult a leading astrologer mainly to know his own future and that of the country. The astrologer who had had occasion to read the Natal Charts of several leaders of this country is on first name-terms with half the countrys top team, they say.
The offspring who initially had entertained some nagging doubts about the bona fides of the astrologer had suddenly turned a great faithful of his when he (the astrologer) made an accurate reading about a very personal matter which was a secret he had hitherto jealously guarded. The astrologer is said to have made some astounding predictions about some political leaders in the country. And what had impressed him most is a predication about a dramatic political event due to come about in 2020.
Now back in the country the purohitas offspring is maintaining a deafening silence about the forecasts made by the astrologer, they say.

Dr. Neville Fernando to settle all loans in 10 years
	
The South-Asian Institute for Technology and Medicine (SAITM) today said that as per the Cabinet Memorandum approved by the Cabinet, the mortgage rights of the Dr. Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH) will remain with the Bank of Ceylon (BoC) until such time all loans are repaid by SAITM within the next 10 years, after which all titles of ownership will be vested with the Government of Sri Lanka.
Issuing a statement, the SAITM also stated that This arrangement was materialized under the advocacy of attorneys of BoC, the government and SAITM in the best interest of all stakeholders. Furthermore, SAITM would like to clarify that the Sri Lankan Government has not made any form of payment to SAITM as compensation or lease, under the said agreement.
Contrary to the statements issued by parties with vested interests, the Dr. Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH) hospital valued at Rs.3.55 billion was ceremonially handed over to the Government to augment the free health care provided by the Government to Sri Lankan citizens.
The land which is owned by the Urban Development Authority (UDA) will be sub-leased to the Ministry of Health for a nominal rent of Rs.1,000 per annum.
The NFTH was ceremonially handed over to the government of Sri Lanka on July 17 in the presence of President Maithripala Sirisena, Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne and Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella.
Accordingly, a tri-party agreement will be signed by the Chairman of SAITM, Secretary to the Ministry of Health and the General Manager of Bank of Ceylon, formally handing over the Dr. Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital, which will function as a government hospital offering free healthcare, effective August 1, 2017.
The Management of SAITM aspires to work alongside the government, as it has done in the past, to uplift the healthcare sector in Sri Lanka, and to thereby enable all citizens, access to efficient and quality health services from qualified professionals, the statement added.

The GMOA said it would disassociate its self from its discussions with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe if he was unable to stop Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne from sabotaging the decisions taken by the GMOA and the Prime Minister on the SAITM issue.
GMOA Secretary Haritha Aluthge told in a news conference the minister had also sabotaged the talks held with the President Maithripala Sirisena.
He said even though the Premier had to seek legal requirement to gazette the minimum standard of the medical education the Legal Draftsman Department had replied saying it could not be done due to several legal concerns.
There was no legal issue when Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH) was acquired by the government. When it comes to a public matter we have to undergo many legal issues. It is Minister Senaratne who is disrupting the whole process, Dr. Aluthge said.
He requested the Prime Minister to control the minister's actions or the GMOA would withdraw from the discussions and urged the Health Minister sto gazette the minimum standard of the medical education without any delay. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Govt. unhappy with UN Special Rapporteur's report
	
The government, which is unhappy with the outcome of the visit to Sri Lanka and the report released by UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Counter-terrorism, Ben Emerson, will introduce a new procedure for officials visiting Sri Lanka, the Cabinet spokesman said.
Minister Rajitha Senaratne said the Foreign Affairs Ministry had permitted him to meet LTTE detainees, but from now on the Foreign Ministry will consult the Defense Ministry and Prison Commissioner General before permitting a foreign official to engage in such missions.
The ministers are concerned about Mr. Emersons behaviour and the report that included controversial information which we cannot agree with. It was revealed that the Foreign Affairs Ministry without the knowledge of the defence ministry had permitted him to interview the LTTE suspects. The President has instructed the authorities to formulate a new procedure to regulate and monitor the visits of foreign officials to Sri Lanka," Minister Senaratne said.
He said such issues would have to be handled carefully to avoid tarnishing the image of Sri Lanka among the global community and confirmed that the government was committed to respect various international conventions and treaties it had signed and ratified.
The minister said allegations of murder, abductions and torture have been levelled against the armed forces personnel and it was the governments responsibility to inquire into them, based on the law of the land and International Humanitarian Law (IHL) which Sri Lanka was a signatory to.
The government cannot abdicate this responsibility to probe these allegations. It is our responsibility to do justice to the victims, which is why the government released the Mahanama Report on the killing at Katunayaka during police firing, he said.
The minister said the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime did not release the Mahanama Report despite repeated requests from the parents of Roshen Chanaka who was killed during police firing in 2011. Roshen was killed when the security forces attempted to quell the peaceful protest against the move to introduce a pension scheme for the private sector using funds from the EPF. The parents had obtained the Mahanama Report on an application under the Right to Information Act.
Having learnt a lesson from this atrocious incident, the yahapalana government has decided not to deploy armed forces to quell riots by civilians, he said.
The minister said he had obtained first hand information from about 50 parents of victims of abductions and killings in the North. They were summoned to Temple Trees, when he was appointed by President Rajapaksa as the Chairman of a cabinet sub-committee to probe the allegations. (Sandun A. Jayasekera)

The one who presided over the Diyawanna council during the previous regime had recently received a very important telephone call.

The caller was a purohita, the namesake of his more illustrious younger sibling who too is hailing from Giruwapattu.
The purohita had rung up the elderly politico to convey his denial of a certain controversial public statement attributed to him by the former council chairs other sibling who once handled the countrys defense establishment. After making this denial, the purohita charged that another member of the clan had spread the statement attributed to him.
The elderly politico who was taken aback by this accusation asked the purohita to identify the member of his clan who gave wings to the statement. The he gave the name of a young member of the same family.
Then the former council chair had quietly settled the issue saying: The young man you named never told me anything about the statement attributed to you. 
But several others who spoke to us told us that you made that controversial statement. Now that you are saying you never made the remarks attributed to you, I am prepared to accept your denial. So the matter ends there!

Asked why he was playing hide and seek for no apparent reason, the truant politico had first given some evasive answers. Pressed to come out with the real reason, the burly one had blurted out: How can I remain in the country when everyone I happen to meet asks me the same question: Machang, are you going to join the JO Even a big chap in yahapalanaya asked me when I was going to quit.
Pestering by government chaps is bad enough. What is worse is that the JO guys also keep on asking me as to when I propose to join them. So I decided that the best thing to do was to get lost!

How we can best treat Varicose Veins
	



Are you also an individual who has been experiencing an unbearable achy pain in your legs since recently On top of it, did you happen to notice some weird, bulging cord like structures with a bluish discolouration on those painful sites which are remarkably visible following prolonged hours of standing Given the said symptoms and signs do they make it embarrassing to wear short, fashionable clothes to parties 

If the answer to all the above questions is yes, there is a very high possibility that you are also a victim of this common surgical condition known as Varicose Veins. 



Definition
Varicose Veins are defined as swollen, enlarged, twisted, bluish or purplish veins, most commonly visible on legs and feet. According to the latest research, approximately 23% of adults suffer from this condition and tend to seek help, not merely due to pain and discomfort but due to cosmetic reasons as well. 

Reasons
Veins are cord like structures in our body which pump de-oxygenated blood to the heart in order to get purified and pumped all over the body through arteries. To carry out this function in a single direction, veins are structurally formed with valves inside. Individuals who are prone to get Varicose Veins have weakened or less flexible walls on veins, making the valves weaker, resulting in an accumulation of blood inside-thus leading to enlarged and swollen veins filled with de-oxygenated blood. 

This phenomenon can occur in the veins of our body, but legs and feet are the most affected. This is due to the gravitational forces in these lower parts of the body which further support the accumulation of blood within vessels. 

Even though its not very clear as to why the walls of the vessels haphazardly weaken, experts have related these potential risk factors regarding Varicose Veins: 

The incidence is higher in women due to the effect of hormones which are known to relax blood vessels 
	Menopause 
	Hormonal replacement therapy 
	Oral contraceptive Pills 
	Pregnancy 
	Age: Over 50 
	Prolonged hours of sitting and standing-house wives, garment workers 
	Family history of varicose veins 
	Obesity 
	Congenital abnormalities of veins 
	Other than that, any factor which contributes to excessive pressure on the abdomen can give rise to varicose veins which may include, 
	Pregnancy 
	Constipation 
	Tumours 
	Presentation
	Varicose Veins arent painful in a majority of the individuals, but are known to create unusual discomfort. 
	Twisted, swollen, lumpy veins 
	Bluish or purplish discolouration 
	A feeling of heaviness in legs specially after prolong hours of standing and at night 
	Burning or throbbing sensation in legs sometimes associated with heavy muscle cramps 
	Trauma to the affected site, causing a longer duration of bleeding than usual 
	Lipodermatosclerosis  hardening of fat under the skin just above the ankle, causing some shrunken appearance 

Swollen ankles 
	Telangiectasia in the affected leg (spider veins) 
	A Shiny, brownish or bluish discoloration over the skin of the affected site 
	Venous eczema (Stasis dermatitis) - Red, dry and itchy skin over the affected site sometimes resulting in Ulceration 
	Leg cramps on sudden change of posture 
	Restless legs syndrome 
	Atrophie blanche  Irregularly whitish scary patches on ankles 
	Can it give rise to serious complications
	Yes, untreated severe varicose veins can result in complications including: 
	Leg ulcers- Extremely painful, inflamed areas particularly near ankles as a result of long term fluid accumulation and excessive pressure in affected sites. The most initial sign could be a discoloured spot. So if you happen to spot one, its advisable to seek immediate medical advice. 
	Blood clots- Occasionally these swollen veins can get further enlarged within a short period of time. This indicates the necessity for immediate medical attention, because there can be the presence of a blood clot obstructing the circulation as a result of stagnant and slow blood flow. 
	Bleeding- In some individuals, veins located closer to the skin can burst causing minor bleeding, but its always advisable to obtain medical care as there is a high chance for this kind of a bleeding to re-occur. 


Diagnosis
Following a complete history (achy pain or discomfort) and thorough physical examination, your doctor will come to a clinical diagnosis of varicose veins. He might also want to run an Ultra Sound to detect any abnormalities in the blood flow and Venogram to detect any underlying pathologies.


Treatment
Most health care professionals prefer conservative management on patients with this condition. 
	Life style modifications: 
	Avoid standing for prolonged hours 
	Maintaining a healthy weight 
	Exercises to improve blood circulation. 
	Using compression socks or stockings. 
	Surgical treatment (Vein ligation and stripping) is indicated in patients who experience unbearable pain affecting the quality of life, complications or cosmetic issues. 


Other treatment options: 
Sclerotherapy 
	Microsclerotherapy 
	Laser surgery 
	Endovenous ablation therapy 
	Endoscopic vein surgery 
	Take home message
Varicose veins usually worsen over a period of time if not managed properly. So, its up to you to seek medical advice without delaying, to avoid symptoms getting worse. This calls for invasive surgical treatment. Remember there are plenty of options to follow.

Indian Army jawan shoots dead Major
	

New Delhi, (Hindustan Times, Hindustan Times), New Delhi - Angry over being ticked off for using cellphone on duty, an army jawan posted in Jammu and Kashmirs Uri sector on Tuesday pumped five bullets into a major, killing him on the spot. 
Major Shikhar Thapa belonged to 71 Armoured Regiment but was attached to 8 Rashtriya Rifles, the armys elite counter-insurgency unit deployed in Uri, close to the Line of Control, an army spokesperson said, confirming the fratricidal killing. 
Hindustan Times has learnt that Thapa pulled up the jawan, whose identity is not known, and told him he would be reported to the commanding officer for using mobile phone while on duty in a sensitive area. 
The phone was damaged while being confiscated, which led to an argument after which the jawan shot the officer with his AK-47 rifle at around 12.15am.

Indian girl detained in Sri Lanka for Buddha image on dress
	
Sri Lanka police on Monday detained and questioned an Indian tourist who was wearing a dress with a print of the Buddha on it, The Hindu reported.
Wearing the image of the Buddha remains a sensitive matter in the island where a majority practise Buddhism. In 2014, a British tourist was deported for sporting a tattoo of the Buddha on her arm.
The 26-year-old tourist was on the island on a family holiday at a resort near Bentota, along the southern coast of Sri Lanka. Before the groups departure from Colombo on Monday, some of them were shopping at an upmarket mall in the capital.
One of my nephews rushed to the store next door and bought a T-shirt, so my niece could wear it over the dress. But the police did not allow her to do that. They asked her to come to the police station with them, Ms. Deepam told The Hindu over telephone, upon her return to Chennai.
Insisting that she would accompany her niece, Ms. Deepam went to the police station, where they were made to sign a statement and apologise, before being allowed to proceed to the airport for departure.
When contacted, the police said the family was let off with a warning. Wearing such a print is an offence according to the penal code. It is not just about the Buddha, wearing prints of deities of any religion is considered offensive, police spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara told The Hindu. However, senior lawyer J.C. Weliamuna said: Only defaming a religion is a criminal offence in Sri Lanka, wearing a normal print of the Buddha does not amount to that. This is ridiculous.

Yahapalanayas 18-member dissident group had planned a night-time tryst in the VIP lounge of a high-end hotel in Rajagiriya area the other day.

In the afternoon of the day of the planned powwow one group member from Gampaha who was rearing to attend it had rung up a certain TB of the group from a government office to double-check the exact venue of the proposed secret meeting. It had so happened that at the time he was making the call, there had been a shrewd deputy from the same district in this office within hearing distance. The deputy who quietly sloped away with the vital information had conveyed it to the high-ups in yahapalanaya.
Some members who turned up at the Rajagiriya hotel in the night had sensed that an intelligence net had already been cast on the place and they had beaten a hasty retreat warning others whom they met that the jig was up.
However, some bold ones who had stayed back had got bolder still after a drink or two and proceeded to take several far-reaching decisions about their political future, they say.

Keep your baby safe by avoiding these toxins!
	

By Minoli Ratnayake
Mums would do anything to protect their babies and ensure safety. Its an instinct theyre born with. Yet, according to environmental studies, children are exposed to as much as 27 dangerous chemicals a day through personal care products. Mothers allow this not because they dont care for their children or knowingly expose them to danger, but because they lack knowledge. They dont understand how dangerous these chemicals can be or the damage they can cause to a developing baby.

According to the nonprofit Environmental Working Group (EWG), The EPA has determined that infants up to age 2 are, on average, 10 times more vulnerable to carcinogenic chemicals than adults, and from age 2 to 15 they are 3 times more vulnerable to carcinogens than adults. 
This is vital information that every parent must know. As a society, we must be concerned about what our children absorb through their skin, the bodys largest organ. There are numerous ingredients we should avoid in a plethora of products, from soaps, washes, powders, and lotions to laundry detergent, candles, and air fresheners. Its scary, but true that some potentially toxic ingredients and known carcinogens are not even required by law to be labeled on products.The best option is to stick with natural, nourishing, and certified organic ingredients. 
So to keep your baby safe, always read the labels and avoid using baby-care products that use any of these toxic chemicals. 

Talc 
This powdered mineral is added to baby powder (and many other cosmetic powders). Its used as a drying agent, but its a known lung irritant and may also be carcinogenic. As Gillian Deacon describes in her book Theres Lead In Your Lipstick: The mineral talc tends to occur in rock mass formations that intermingle with other magnesium silicate minerals, including the highly dangerous asbestos. Since its virtually impossible to extract the talc rock from the asbestos during the mining process, the carcinogenic contaminant will almost invariably be carried over into any consumer product containing talc. 

Fragrance 
Fragrance is added to countless products, either to give a particular fragrance or to mask the odour of the nasty chemicals used in the product. The problem with fragrance is that its a catch-all term for whatever secret ingredients companies wish to add and are generally made of coal- and petroleum-derived synthetic chemicals. 
The effects of fragrance are long lasting, linger on the skin for hours, and can cause respiratory, neurological, skin, and eye damage. There is evidence that exposure to fragrance as a child may lead to asthma. 

Proplyene glycol 
This chemical is a penetration enhancer that is easily absorbed by the skin and may be carcinogenic. Its job is to open up all the pores and let the other chemicals in. Propylene glycol is used in wiper fluid and to de-ice airplanes, and yet it is often found in baby wipes, which is not safe. Look out for polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polypropylene glycol (PPG) on labels, too. 

1,4-dioxane and ethylated surfactants 
This is a by-product of a cheap manufacturing process called ethoxylation. This process uses a cancer-causing petrochemical ethylene oxide. The result is something that is a carcinogen, kidney toxicant, neurotoxin, and respiratory toxin. Not good. Because its a by-product of a manufacturing process and not an ingredient itself. You really have to be aware to avoid it. 
If you see any ingredients that contain the letters eth, then that is an indicator of the presence of 1,4-dioxane. Stay away from polyethylene, polyethylene glycol, sodium laureth sulfate, ceteareth, oleth, oxynol, -xynol, and PEG. 

Mineral oil 
Baby oil is essentially made of mineral oil mixed with fragrance, which is a nasty combination. Mineral oil is a cheap byproduct of petroleum processing and acts as a plastic wrap on the skin, inhibiting the skins ability to release toxins. Opt instead for natural and nourishing oils such as certified organic olive, coconut, or sweet almond to massage into your babys skin. 

Parabens 
Unfortunately parabens are everywhere. They can be found in all soaps, body washes, shampoos, and moisturizers, including those marketed toward babies. Parabens are neurotoxins and are linked to reproductive toxicity, hormone disruption, and skin irritation. Stay away from anything with paraben in its name, as well as benzoic acid and propyl ester. 

Triclosan 
Anything thats labeled as antibacterial likely contains triclosan, which is a carcinogenic endocrine disruptor thats harmful to the environment. Although it makes sense to keep your baby away from unnecessary bacteria, thats the wrong approach to take. By raising our babies in sterile environments, we inhibit their ability to create natural resistance and immunity, increase the likelihood of allergies, and render antibacterial treatments less effective for when we truly need them to work. 
In summary, as much as its important to apply things on our babies, our children and our bodies, its also important to know what we are putting on them. So the next time you shop for a bath wash or moisturising cream take a good look at the ingredients- where ever possible look for pure, natural, certified organic products because they are the safest. Also remember to watch out for those toxic Phthalates and Parabens that can cause a host of skin irritations and other complications, especially in your precious children.

2009 Lahore attack and 2011 final:  Minister ready to launch probe
	
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said today he was prepared to investigate the terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan Cricket Team in Lahore in 2009 and the controversy surrounding the 2011 Cricket World Cup final at which Sri Lanka was beaten by India.
He said he would gladly welcome the World Cup-Winning Cricket Captain and Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga to the Sri Lanka Cricket Board in case he won the next SLCB election.
The minister who a co-cabinet spokesman said he was aware of the remarks that had been made by former captain Arjuna Ranatunge on cricket, the Lahore attack and his willingness to serve Sri Lanka cricket if he was appointed to head the Cricket Interim Committee, should the present cricket board be dissolved.
Yes, I appreciate the remarks made by my friend Arjuna. If he hopes to accept the responsibility of cricket administration, he must wait until the next cricket board election. I am ready to appoint a board of inquiry if he makes a written request to probe the Lahore terrorist attack and the controversy surrounding the 2011 World Cup Cricket finals in India because we are all keen to know the circumstances that led to the attack and our defeat, the minister said.
Commenting on the one-off test victory against Zimbabwe in a record breaking run chase, the minister said Sri Lankan cricketers do have inborn talents, and the need of the hour was to direct them on the right path.
He requested the media to refrain from discouraging our cricketers by negative comments, at least until the end of the forthcoming Indian cricket tour. (Sandun A. Jayasekera)

Lankan maid files law suit in HK
	
A Sri Lankan house maid had filed a law suit in the Hong Kong High Court claiming that the HK Government requirement that helpers lived and worked in their employers residence violated international law against slave labour, the EJ Insight news website said.
It said:
In a writ filed in the High Court on Tuesday, Rankothpedi Duravalage Kamalawathi, said she had been mistreated by her employer since she was hired in 2012.
She claimed that she is now suffering from schizophrenia and auditory hallucination, which prevents her from continuing to work.
Kamalawathi blamed her condition on exploitation by her employer. She said her employer paid her less than the minimum wage, cut her leave short and demanded she worked in multiple places.
She said that although the Director of Immigration has the authority to put restrictions on conditions of domestic helpers stay, such restrictions should be limited only to their types of work, employers and work addresses, and should not apply to regulate where they sleep.
The live-in requirement not only breaches international law but also makes foreign domestic helpers like her discriminated against since other foreign workers doing other jobs are allowed to choose where they can live.
She asked the court to find the requirement unreasonable and illegal.
The case is the second of its kind after a domestic worker sought a judicial review on the live-in requirement in November last year.  (EJ Insight)

Lets make cancer a socially acceptable topic
	

Cancer is everyones greatest fear in this day and age, due to its unpredictable nature. Its a topic thats taboo in a country like Sri Lanka and people arent willing to speak openly about it. However Dr. Tan Wu Meng, Consultant, Medical Oncology at the Parkway Cancer Centre in Singapore states otherwise and encourages the public to spread awareness on the subject.


He states that this will make cancer a comfortable, conversational topic in order to make people more willing to get themselves checked and learn more about the disease. 
Dr. Tan says that lung cancer is a common killer in the world. Many people die from lung cancer every year. When considering the overall population, the biggest risk of lung cancer is through smoking. In this respect, even if you consider air pollution, its not as concentrated as smoke from a cigarette. However, we also sometimes meet patients who havent smoked their first cigarette, but have contracted lung cancer. It could have been second hand smoke or relate to family history. These are patients we want to help too. So if you are smoking, we encourage you to stop and help not only yourself, but your loved ones as well. If youre not smoking, dont even start. 


He further said, In Asia, lung cancer is still very common because unfortunately smoking is still very prevalent even in countries where the young people dont smoke as much. Older generations who have grown up smoking already have a lifetime of tobacco smoke in their lungs, so it is still an issue. Other cancers that we worry about in Asia would be cervix cancer and breast cancer among women because if you detect it early, it enhances the chance of curing. This is why we want to build awareness and encourage women to undergo checks and not to be afraid to talk about it. If you are afraid to talk about it, then you become afraid to see a doctor and get treatment early. Colon cancer too is very curable with early detection. But again, in many countries, whether its Asia or even in some of the Western Countries, people still dont talk about it. So what we really want to promote all over Asia is for people to make cancer a topic for conversation. If people are unafraid to take treatment, go for screening-because there was an old perception that we picked up cancer at the place screening took place- and take treatment early, it will help patients recover faster.  Highlighting that early detection of cancer can give you a better chance of cure, Dr. Tan said,In the early stages of cancer, the treatment is simpler and often shorter. Some cancers like stage 4 lymphoma may still be curable. There are treatments for some other cancers in stage 4 like lung cancer, even if they arent curable. These treatments can prolong life of the patient in a way which maintains the quality of life. Even if patients cant be cured, newer treatments are helping patients live longer, better and more comfortably. 
Speaking about the different screening tests for cancers, he said, For colon cancer, some patients will go for what they call a stool test, where they look for traces of blood in the stool. Another option is a colonoscopy, where a little camera is sent into the colon and pictures are taken. That is a better quality test than the stool test. For breast cancer, the standard screening test is a mammogram. For cervix cancer, its a pap smear. Unfortunately for lung cancer, we dont have a good screening test yet, but theres still a lot of research being done. 
We find that regarding lung cancer, a majority of patients are detected during stage 3 or stage 4. Some patients may have gone for a health check up and they incidentally found a lump in the lung when they went for a chest X Ray. Those would be the patents in the early stage of cancer. But by the time the lung cancer is causing symptoms, usually it is quite big and it has started to spread. There is a lot of research being done on lung cancer screening. There is an American study, a national lung screening trial in America, where they monitor very heavy smokers who have smoked for many years. Theyve sent these smokers for CT scans. They found that in some smokers you can pick up the cancer early, but when they looked at the statistics, the Americans found that you have to scan 320 heavy smokers to pick up 1 lung cancer patient earlier than usual. So still we dont have a standard screening test. Because a lot of testing is needed a lot of radiation is involved and not many people benefit. So thats one of the areas where experts are looking to
improve, he added.  But every cancer is different. Each organ of the body can carry its own cancer. It can be a source of cancer, but each cancer can be treated differently, depending on where it started, what stage is it in and how fit the patient is,
Dr. Tan added.
He further stated that the stigma against cancer patients is a worldwide problem, not just in Asia. Some of that stigma may be based on myths that cancer is contagious, which is not. It cannot be spread from patient to patient, but sometimes there is this myth and people get scared. There is also this stigma where people assume that cancer cant be cured. So when someone gets cancer, it may harm prospects. Again, that stigma can change around the world. There is a lot of room to improve that, both in the Western nations and the Asian nations. 
Keep learning more about cancer. Public awareness is important. Keep on asking more and talking more. Because by doing this we can protect ourselves and our loved ones, concluded Dr. Tan.

London wont roll out the red carpet for Donald Trump: London Mayor
	

London, (Daily Mail0, 18 July 2017 -  Londons Mayor Sadiq Khan has warned Donald Trump that there will be no red carpet should he visit the United Kingdom. 
The Mayor of London renewed his war of words with the U.S. President ahead of a proposed state visit to the capital. 
Theresa May had officially invited Trump to the UK in January but the trip was left out of the Queens Speech last month, ending hopes it would happen this year. 
Despite an invite from the UK government, both sides have failed to arrange a date amid reports that Mr Trump has been put off by the threat of large-scale protests.Among the Presidents main opponents in the UK has been Mr Khan, who opposed Trumps travel ban which targeted people from mainly Muslim countries. 
Speaking to CNN about the mooted state visit, Mr Khan said he was ready to play my role when it came to challenging peoples opinions.

lowest Dalit caste
	
Indian lawmakers voted Monday for a new president certain to come from the bottom of the Hindu caste system, in an election seen as strengthening Prime Minister Narendra Modis grip on power. 
Ninety-nine percent of the 4,896 legislators nationwide voted in the poll, according to officials, in what Modi termed a historic election to choose the titular head of state. 
Ram Nath Kovind, the candidate of Modis right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and a former lawyer and state governor from the Dalit community, is certain to win. 
His main rival is Meira Kumar, the nominee of the Congress-led opposition and also a Dalit. 
But the BJP, which won a landslide in a general election in 2014, has for the first time assembled enough electoral college votes across the country to push through its presidential candidate. Congress has traditionally dominated the post. 
There is no rocket science, Ram Nath Kovind will win today, Praful Patel, a leader of the small opposition Nationalist Congress Party, conceded as he cast his vote. 
Counting of votes and the result will be announced on Thursday. 
Modi was among the first to vote, using a specially approved violet ink pen. The election commission barred the use of personal pens to ensure clean voting.

Mtuwa Uni animal deaths: Animal Rights Activists to file petition
	
Animal Rights groups yesterday said they would file a petition at the Supreme Court over the alleged sedation of dogs and cats that led to the animals' death at the Moratuwa University.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Animal Rights Activist, Attorney Lalani Perera said the petition preventing such inhumane acts in the future will be filed with the support of animal rights organizations and will be backed by students of the Moratuwa University.
After a shocking video of at least 23 dogs and some cats being stunned with toxic substance went viral, animal rights activist had collected evidence and witness statements which would be submitted to Court, Mrs. Perera said.
Meanwhile, another animal rights activist Ms. Hasini Silva said their main focus now was to save the remaining animals at the university premises by seeking legal assistance. The activists hoped to request measures be taken for the safety of the animals when the petition was filed, she said.
There arent many laws for Animal Welfare, but we are trying to bring those responsible before the law. We believe the Court would do justice and prevent these barbaric acts in the future, she said.
Ms. Silva also said the biggest struggle was to ensure the Animal Welfare Bill and the Dog Registration Bill was passed in parliament soon.(Thilanka Kanakarathna)

More liberalization before next budget: PM
	
Saying there are government regulations which are barriers to competitiveness among Sri Lankan entrepreneurs, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremsinghe said today there would be a round of liberalization before the next budget and a system whereby the minimum wage for the Sri Lankan working class would be US$400.
He said this at a forum organized by the European Chamber of Commerce in Sri Lanka on the theme, 'Sri Lanka-the next Asian Economic Miracle.
The Premier said he would make a statement on Sri Lanka's economic policy prior to the presentation of the budget and underscored the fact that GSP plus was the key to Sri Lankas development.
We have the ability to develop our economy and strengthen our democracy. Open market leads to open societies and we are committed to both. Now this is a challenge for Sri Lankan domestic investors. How do we utilize these opportunities. GSP plus gives us the opportunity to deal with 6,500 products that could be marketed in Europe. I dont think we can manufacture 6,500 products, no one can. What are the areas we are going to focus on. How do we go ahead. It is by collaborating with foreign direct investors. We should make sure that our private sector is strong enough for investment. I know there are Government regulations which are actually barriers. Before the next budget there will be another round of liberalization. I hope to make a statement on the economic policy prior to the budget. We are having a tight fiscal policy because of the debt situation. We need to find space to pay the debts which amounts to Rs.4.2 trillion, the Premier said.
We need to look at the productivity as well, productivity means a workforce dedicated to productivity. Part of the gains will have to be shared with the workforce. We have to move towards a minimum pay or allowances of US$400. There is a large low wage-based industry developing in Myanmar and Bangladesh. We cannot and should not compete with them. The world is changing, new technologies are coming in. So where do you want be. Is it the low end T-shirts industry or middle part of 3D printing industry. We are also looking at tourism, we are opening up for domestic tourism. We have only one direct flight to Europe by Srilankan airlines, if others want to fly it is open. So we will be inviting you to discuss with you on how to make use of these opportunities and how to work with you, to create jobs and incomes for the people of Sri Lanka. This is a time where we can stage a revolution. This could be done through peaceful means.
He said the present government had to clear things up in the economy during the past two years. Alakeshwara got a marshy land but he built up Kotte out of it. We too got a marshy land where there were snakes, jackals, dogs and what not. We had to clean it up for two years just like Alakeshwara who built up Kotte. Kotte was developed with the revenue gained from selling spices and cinnamon and we too will have to spend for the development through funds generated from our own economy, the Premier said.
Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said the government was looking at sweeping reforms in the financial sector under which a new tax system aimed at changing the direct/indirect tax ratio to 60 /40. He said commercial laws would also be changed while the Customs Act would be amended.
Development Polices and International Trade Malik Samarasinghe said the free trade agreements which were in the pipeline would soon be a reality.(Yohan Perera)

MYTH: Mouthwash can help with bad breath. 

BUSTED: It depends on where the bad breath is coming from. It can come from the mouth or the bad breath can originate from the deeper part of the body like from the stomach or the oesophagus. If it comes from the mouth then you can use mouthwash to alleviate the bad breath. However, when it originates from a deeper part of the body, mouthwash doesnt help.  When you have cavities, severe gum disease with bleeding, infections in the wisdom tooth, wounds or ulcers in your mouth, coating or depositions on your tongue, infections on your salivary glands etc. you can bring about bad breath.
These are the causes inside the mouth. Apart from this if you have a sort of infection or diseases in your stomach or the food tract or when you have chronic vomiting, you can get bad breath. explained Dr. Vipula Wickramasinghe, General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Dental Association and Regional Dental Surgeon of the Colombo District

New NCPC chairman's election undemocratic: JO
	
Claiming it was unlawful to present a no-confidence motion against North Central Provincial Council (NCPC) Chairman T.M.R. Siripala, joint opposition MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage said yesterday said the procedure adopted to elect the new chairman was undemocratic.
He said they were utterly disgusted with the tense situation that prevailed in the NCPC and have no hesitation to go to court against those who misbehaved and violated the agenda of the council's constitution.
"It is unlawful to present a no-confidence motion against NCPC Chairman T.M.R. Siripala of the UPFA as he had not violated the constitution nor had was he involved in wrongful activities. Therefore, we urge the President to look into this matter and conduct an investigation to see that democracy was upheld in the Council," the MP said.
He also claimed that the government was attempting to sell the Hambantota Port to a Chinese company, in the wake of the appointment of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority's new Chairman Parakrama Dissanayake.
"Mr. Dissanayake is the chief negotiator in the sale of the Hambantota Port to a Chinese company. He is not an independent figure representing the SLPA. Therefore, action needs to be taken to find a solution to this, as it is a national resource which is being sold to a foreign company," the MP said.
Meanwhile, LSSP leader Tissa Vitharana said the government had not taken over the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital on a policy decision.
"Even when the Sri Lanka Medical Council has not approved this hospital, the government tries to provide services to the people. We urge the government to be serious on this issue and ensure the quality standard of the hospital without putting the people into difficulty, " he added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

A letter was handed over to the Speaker of Parliament stating that five members of the National Freedom front (NFF) representing the UPFA will withdraw from the constitutional assembly.
The letter signed by MPs Wimal Weerawansa, Weerakumara Dissnayake, Jayantha Smaraweera, Udayashantha Gunasekara and Niroshan Premarathna cited ten reasons for the decision.
The parliamentarians said they bowed down to the Mahanayake Theros view that the country did not need a new constitution at the moment and questioned the legality of the process as they alleged the public was neither informed of the assemblys decisions nor were they a part of it. 
The letter also said the government and the President did not have the mandate to establish, maintain and implement the decisions of such an assembly, while the Joint Opposition did not have the mandate to be a part of it.
Discussions of the six sub committees appointed by the assembly not being revealed to the media and the opposition allegedly not being allowed to express its views during these meetings, in addition to the lack of faith that the process would result in a constitution accepted by all parties were other reasons cited by the group. 
The letter pointed out that the parliamentarians withdrawal from the process questioned the legality of the assembly as all members of parliament needed to be a part of it.

Health is a trending topic at the tip of every ones tongue today. There are many diseases that endanger ones health with many more new diseases being discovered daily. Some can be cured while others cant. Some may be fatal while others arent. The phrase health is wealth stays true to every word in the phrase and many more people have started paying attention and caring for their health than in the past. The publics interest on medical issues has increased over a period of time. For the people who are eager to maintain healthy lifestyles today, Mahajana Suwa Dhana emerged victorious in serving just that purpose. 

Mahajana Suwa Dhana, a medical exhibition organized at the BMICH, in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Ceylon College of Physicians commenced on July 14 and will conclude on July 16. It served the purpose of educating the public on the latest developments in medicine and empowering their audience in health management. Specialists from medical associations and medical faculties from all over the country joined forces to help raise awareness to inquiring minds. The event was graced by the presence of the Minister of health, nutrition and indigenous medicine, Rajitha Senarathna, as the chief guest. 
Dr. Dumitha Govindapala, Consultant Physician, commented on the exhibitions events. We had more than a 100 stalls. All the medical specialists came together from around 40 colleges which included Medical colleges, NDCU, Blood Donation campaign, Saukyadana, and many others. Our health status has been double burdened with communicable and non communicable diseases. The country spends a lot of money to cure the diseases . Sticking to the statement that prevention is better than cure, we hoped that the conduction of this exhibition would help in educating public and raising awareness. There were blood tests conducted free of charge courtesy of the Ministrys mobile Laboratory services. There was a stall organized by the Ceylon College of Internal Medicine where free consultations were offered to the public among other programs we conducted. 
The public was open to panel discussions conducted by consultant physicians of common health conditions such as diabetes, heart attacks, asthma, dengue and high blood pressure where the public very keenly got involved, getting their doubts clarified. The highlight of the exhibition was the very many health educational stalls exceeding 100 in number through which presentations were conducted to raise awareness on common medical conditions, screening, diagnosis, treatments and preventive methods. 
There were many medical areas for one to explore which included a high tech zone which allowed the audience to have a glimpse at the future of medicine with holograms and virtual 3D imaging in amazement. The importance of physical fitness and exercises was discussed at stalls in the sports area which got the crowds to actively participate in exercises. The current epidemic, dengue, earned itself a special stall where the dos and donts of dengue were stressed. There were stalls on toxicology held in hope of educating all nature daredevils on poisonous plants and snakes. For those who love a good thrill and all things criminal and mysterious, a forensic section was available. The same can be said about the inquisitive and curious, as they were satisfied with the stalls themed on anatomical mysteries of the human body. Stalls were also held in connection with subjects like sexual health, alcohol and smoking issues and rehabilitation. The healthy lifestyle zone as the name implied, helped educate the public on how to get the best of life. The public also basked in the opportunities of free health check-ups such as blood tests, blood pressure checks, blood sugar checks, cholesterol checks and last, but not least hearing and vision. 

A stroll through the stalls
The Sri Lankan Heart Association, at their stall were focusing on the importance of recognizing heart attacks and seeking immediate help. Dr. M. R. Mubarak, Consultant Cardiologist and the president of the SLHA said that most people ignore the symptoms of a heart attack mistaking them for indigestion, arthritic pains etc. He said that most patients arrive at the hospital when the situation is critical. He said that early admission is a major factor that improves the outcome of a heart attack. Patients having a heart attack usually present with chest pain and tightness on the central and left side of the chest, arm pain, pain in the neck lower chest or upper abdominal area, shortness of breath, excessive sweating, nausea and vomitting. It is advisable for them to seek immediate medical care if a person is having one or more of these signs. 
Geriatrics is a relatively new field of specialty in Sri Lanka, focusing on the medical issues that come with old age. Their theme for this year was, for a dignified Silver age, meaning that getting old doesnt mean that you have to depend on others and be less active than you used to be. The stall offered information about issues like Dementia and osteoporosis which are common problems with older citizens. 
The stall of the College of Pulmonologists

Sri Lankan Eye Donation Society had a stall where they explained the importance of donating eyes posthumus. Your age or poor vision doesnt matter in donating your eye tissues, which will be processed by the eye bank and will be donated for free to a person who will continue to see the world through your eyes, long after youve departed. You can get more details on donating your eyes and body tissues by contacting National Eye Donation Society at 011-2692051. 
Sri Lankan College of Pulmonologists had demonstrated the latest advancements in the field of pulmonology, including Endobronchial Ultrasound Scan and Fiber Optic Bronchoscopy. In addition to providing details about the commonest respiratory diseases like Asthma and COPD, they highlighted the importance of a condition called Obstructive Sleep Apnoea which can be present in people who are snoring. This condition should be taken very seriously because it has very damaging repercussions. It has been proven that people with this condition are more prone to get depression and have a higher chance of getting into accidents in addition to other complications. So if you snore heavily in your sleep and feel tired soon after waking up, Dr Bodhika Samarasinghe, Consultant Pulmunologist at the Jaffna hospital advises to consult your family physician immediately. 
In addition to the stalls by the specialist Colleges, and Societies in the field of Medicine, Some of the Medical Faculties also had participated in the event. The stall conducted by the Medical Education Department, Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya was focused on the use of Modern technology in Medical Education. The stall was a perfect example of how the traditional could be incorporated with modern technology to give an optimum earning experience to the student. The stall had supplied the audience with an interactive experience, where they got to experience first hand the technologies like virtual reality. Dr. Madhawa Chandrathilake, Head of the Department of Medical Education, speaking about the contents in the stall said that even though these technologies are rarely used in teaching these days, this will be the future of medical education. 
Models of kidneys and nephrons

Among the stalls were the ones conducted by the Ceylon College of Anaesthesiologists, where practical demonstrations on first aid methods like Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation were available to the public. They were able to garner knowledge on what should be done on various emergency situations like choking and cardiac arrest. Another stall on Critical Care Medicine demonstrated an ICU setting, where a patient with serious conditions at risk of losing organ functions are treated with each organ supported by an outside machine, and how they are gradually weaned off the machine when they are getting better. 
Sri Lanka Medical Nutritionists Association demonstrated the ideal diet for a healthy Sri Lankan, where only half of the plate should consist of rice. Two thirds of the remaining part should consist of vegetables while the other one third should contain proteins. The high risk Sri Lankan citizen faces the danger of suffering non communicable diseases like Diabetes due to their incorrect food habits.
In the overall, the exhibition provided a deep insight and a thorough exposure to the various intricasies linked with modern medicine.

Right of reply: CTC has complied with existing laws of the country
	
eylon Tobacco Company PLC (CTC) wishes to clarify its position regarding the news article published in the Daily Mirror on June 20 (Tuesday) under the headline The dwindling tobacco industry - Tobacco no more. The article which is supported by facts taken from an interview with Mr. Pubudu Sumanasekera, CEO of ADIC, has alluded to CTC in the second paragraph and then gone on to level allegations against the tobacco industry. As the only legal manufacturer of cigarettes in the country and with the initial reference made to the Company in the article, its highly probable that the said allegations may mislead the public to believe that he was referring to CTC throughout his interview as reproduced in the article. 
We would like to firstly highlight that as per 2016 statistics, the Sri Lankan tobacco market, which amounts to approximately 7 billion sticks, consists of the legal cigarette industry (53%), the beedi industry (46%) and the illicit tobacco trade (1%). CTC is the only legal cigarette manufacturer while there are over 600 manufacturers representing the beedi industry. Although the legal cigarette industry is highly regulated and taxed, beedi enjoys a relatively more favorable operating environment being under regulated and under taxed. The beedi industry contributes merely LKR 2 billion to government revenue annually. 
Ceylon Tobacco Company has operated in Sri Lanka for over 100 years. During this time it has been recognized as one of Sri Lankas most economically impactful corporate organizations, contributing over LKR 87 billion to the national economy through excise, and infusing over LKR 11 billion to the local economy in 2016 alone. We create over 45,000 jobs and support over 300,000 livelihoods across our value chain. The beedi industry is quite a labor-intensive cottage industry that generates around 20,000 employment opportunities. We therefore specifically deny the following statement made by Sumanasekera which read, In comparison with other industries tobacco is not an industry which generates employment, as it is a machine based industry where the use of human resource is minimal. 
Sumanasekera has also gone on to suggest that when tobacco cultivation is minimized in the country, tobacco farmers will no longer be exploited by the tobacco industry to act in the forefront despite government regulations against the industry. CTC sources its entire tobacco leaf requirement from local farmers, thereby creating employment opportunities to over 20,000 farmers and supporting the livelihoods over around 80,000 farmer families across the island. Through its interventions and support, CTC ensures that tobacco cultivation is burden free to the state and that tobacco farmers are guaranteed the purchase of their full crop at a pre-agreed, competitive price at the start of the growing season. In addition to this, CTC also provides many other facilities to the farmers such as, all the required agricultural inputs for the crop on a credit basis annually and free agricultural extension services.
And on the ground, CTC offers technical support, maintains a Grower Pension Scheme (which is managed by farmer associations where farmers are eligible to withdraw savings after 55 years) and aids farmers through a phased out loan recovery system in the event of a natural disaster. While there are many parties advocating the curtailing of tobacco cultivation in the country, tobacco farmers are yet to find and alternative crop that offers them the significant and sustainable socio-economic benefits of tobacco. Its therefore no surprise that tobacco farmers want to grow tobacco; a fact that they have continuously conveyed to the Government when suggestions are made to curtail cultivation. 
"Through its interventions and support, CTC ensures that tobacco cultivation is burden free to the state and that tobacco farmers are guaranteed the purchase of their full crop at a pre-agreed, competitive price at the start of the growing season"

Furthermore, Sumanasekera has gone on to say that tobacco cultivation uses very high amounts of insecticides and pesticides, which cause many health hazards, including chronic kidney disease in Sri Lanka. He has also stated that the Government has already decided to stop growing tobacco due to heavy erosion of soil caused by tobacco cultivation and that this will protect the children of tobacco farming families from the risk of lung disease.
Cigarette tobacco farmers use less than 0.1% of the countrys total arable land (2,500 Ha) for cultivation and have continuously reduced their land dependency through year on year yield improvements achieved under the guidance and support of CTC. In addition to the tobacco grown for the manufacture of CTC products, in 2016, around 2,700 Ha of land was used for the cultivation of tobacco for other products such as beedi and chewing betel. Cultivation of cigarette tobacco is carried out under close supervision of the Department of Agriculture.
Unlike other agricultural or cash crops, cigarette tobacco farmers use minimal amounts of chemical fertilizers adopting internationally recognized methods such as integrated pest management systems to reduce dependence on chemical pesticides. CTC was the pioneer in introducing soil conservation techniques such as Sloping Agricultural Land Technology (SALT) as early as the 1990s. This technique has been used in the tobacco industry both locally and internationally. Our farmers are also encouraged to use compost produced from tobacco dust as organic fertilizer.
Through CTCs interventions, they (Farmers) also place a high level of focus on biodiversity and environmental protection through Sustainable Tobacco Production (STP). The notable use of paddy husk as fuel in curing barns, which eliminates the use of firewood, must be mentioned here. We would like to point out that every effort has been made to minimize the environmental footprint of tobacco cultivation and that we see no correlation between chronic kidney disease in Sri Lanka and tobacco cultivation. We also fail to see the link between soil erosion and the risk of lung diseases in children of tobacco growing families in the countries. 
Another statement made by Sumanasekera refers to the tobacco industry targeting the young generation as new users. As a responsible tobacco company, CTC adheres to strict internal marketing principles and ensures no steps have been taken to market our products to anyone below the age of 21, thereby preventing underage smoking. In fact, we continue to support our retailers and traders by providing awareness through youth smoking prevention initiatives as well as continuous training on age verification procedures.
Its interesting to note that a recent global survey conducted from 2012 to 2015 by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), covering 61 countries, has revealed that Sri Lanka has the lowest prevalence of teen smoking (1.7 percent) in the world. While for years, tobacco control groups have continuously accused the industry of promoting smoking among the youth, we believe that this research and the statistics speak for themselves. 
We would also like to stress that ours is a legal business selling a legal product. Whilst we acknowledge that smoking tobacco poses a health risk, we believe that smoking is an informed choice made by adult consumers, who have the right to do so. CTC is the largest tax contributor to the state and plays a catalytic role in Sri Lankas economic development while operating responsibly in the island. Despite these credentials, there have been many instances where tobacco control groups have levelled unfounded, baseless accusations against the company and the industry. Unfortunately, in many of these instances there have been no credible sources nor the presence of verifiable figures. 
We are also troubled by the fact that the same tobacco control groups choose to ignore under-regulated tobacco products such as beedi and continue to attack the only legal player, despite beedi accounting for 46% of the total tobacco market in Sri Lanka. Moreover, most parties involved in tobacco control seem oblivious to the threat of the burgeoning illegal cigarette trade.
In the first quarter of 2017 alone we saw the detection of 35 million sticks of smuggled cigarettes compared to the 4 million detected during the whole of 2016. With only one in ten sticks being detected, an estimated 320 million smuggled sticks are estimated to have penetrated the market resulting in a LKR 13 billion loss to government revenue. 
CTC reiterates that as a responsible corporate citizen, CTC has always complied with all existing laws and regulations in the country and will continue to do so.

Some ministers and officials don't return even after conferences conclude: MS
	
While expressing the need for maintaining some control over foreign travel by ministers and ministry officials, President Sirisena said some those who leave the country to attend conferences overseas fail to return even after the conferences were concluded.
He urged ministry secretaries to control this situation and implement a programme to train all officers, instead of the same officer travelling overseas annually.
The President also emphasized the need for line ministries working jointly in the process of national development, to achieve the development aspirations of the people as well as that of the country.
Expressing his views regarding the transfers of the Divisional Secretaries, the President said a divisional secretary could hold the position for a long period at the same location and added that a transfer policy should be implemented.
He said he had signed many MoUs with foreign countries following his visits to those countries and instructed the secretaries to establish a separate division under an additional secretary, to implement and follow up on these agreements so as to achieve the expected targets.

## Title: Sri Lankas largest Saline Wetland in danger!

Sri Lankas largest Saline Wetland in danger!
	
Meethotamulla Shifted to Muthurajawela - What after July 20 
The Supreme Court suspended the dumping of garbage at Muthurajawela following an interim order issued on July 5. The interim order is valid till July 20. This order was issued following a fundamental rights petition filed by a group of concerned villagers on June 14. Colombo Municipal Council (CMC), CMC Commissioner, Urban Development Authority (UDA), Central Environmental Authority (CEA), Wattala Pradeshiya Sabha, Commissioner General of Department of Agrarian Development, Director General of Department of Wildlife Conservation, Director General of Irrigation Department, Assistant Divisional Secretary, Geological Survey and Mines Bureau and the Attorney General were cited as respondents.
The Supreme Court bench comprising Chief Justice Priyasath Dep and Justice Upali Abeyratne issued the interim order on the Colombo Municipality which was supported by Dr. Sunil Cooray together with Keith De Mel.
Attempts made by a team of journalists from the Daily Mirror to enter the garbage dumping site were foiled at three guarded entryways. However the villagers had already warned us in advance that the unofficial guards present wouldnt let us in. Somehow, we were led to the nearby office, just to be ignored by an official from CMC. This official spoke in a strict manner and said that they were advised not to allow anyone in without CMCs permission. We somehow managed to take a few snaps secretively. While we were observing the garbage dumping site, more than 10 lorries arrived with garbage. The villagers were concerned about the pressing they do with garbage.

"The school has been affected so much by the prevailing rotten smell that it is reported that some students had fainted. But nobody had been brave enough to comment on the injustice caused to them"

The garbage is pressed, but no mound is made and the dirt is then invisible to the unsuspecting eye. Even though the CMC had asserted that they are dumping only decaying materials to the yard at Muthurajawela, the villagers maintained that theres no such separation of garbage when its released into the garbage dump at Kerawalapitiya. Garbage was dumped in places like Delathura, Kerawalapitiya and Pamunugama before the ban was enforced. Now Kerawalapitiya is the only site that permits the dumping of garbage.
Negombo Road, Wattala, Mahabage, Nagoda and Kandana areas were polluted with the odor of garbage. A school adjacent to one of these garbage dumps is Nagoda Maha Vidyalaya. The school has been affected so much by the prevailing rotten smell that it is reported that some students had fainted. But nobody had been brave enough to comment on the injustice caused to them.
The Archbishop of Colombo, Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, had issued a statement critisizing garbage dumping in to Muthurajawela, citing that dangerous clinical waste was mixed with other garbage. Fr. Ananda Vithana from the Bopitiya Church also filed a petition.
A reliable source told the Daily Mirror that certain environmental service units of reputed companies are collecting garbage from around Colombo and are carrying on the dumping of garbage to Muthurajawela from midnight till morning. The villagers were unaware of the secret disposal of garbage taking place at midnight.
Our team spoke to villagers of Kudagaspitiya. This village is plagued by flies after garbage dumping started in Kerawalapitiya. 

We cant stand others dumping garbage in our village
- Dilini Kanchana, a shop owner from Kudagaspitiya
We are facing grave dangers with a polluted environment around us. Swarms of flies are invading our shop, hence protecting food from flies is such a burden. The drivers and construction workers here used to have food from our shop, but now theres a sudden drop in our clientele after the rains that triggered the fly menace.
No food can be kept outside because it attracts flies within seconds. Little ones are frequently getting sick. Even if we are able to shoo away flies, little ones cant and they are always falling sick. The unbearable odor drifts in with the wind and this problem has gathered momentum after the heavy rains. We experienced floods this year and the flood waters took a long time to recede.
This is because the drains were affected by the filling of garbage at Muthurajawela. We cant stand others dumping garbage in our village.
All of Colombos garbage is here
- H. Malkanthi
We have been living in a hell for the past two weeks. The garbage dump stinks and flies are intolerable. My three grandchildren are always suffering from fever, indigestion and vomiting. Doctors are advising us to keep them away from flies, but how in the world can
we do that An year ago, an attempt was made to dump garbage from the Wattala Municipal Council here. The villagers objected fiercely with support coming from local politician Jagath Jayathunga. Now they are dumping all of Colombos garbage here.


After the change of government the dumping started
- D.N.P Gayashan
Nearly 40 or 50 lorries arrive to dump garbage here. This happens from around 8 in the morning till 5.30 pm. The Municipal Councils lorries and tippers are seen transporting garbage, dripping smelly juices in the process. They say they are filling the land with soil. As a result when there are floods, the water doesnt drain fast as in the past. Dengue and Filaria are spreading unlike before. There have been attempts to dump garbage here in the past, but those attempts were successfully blocked. Garbage dumping commenced after the change of government.

Releasing harmful chemicals into Muthurajawela kills fish and is a public nuisance.
- Jagath Gunawardena - Environmental lawyer
The EIA report should have been compiled before initiating any waste management project in over one hectare of land, whether the filling happens in wetlands or in a forestland. In Muthurajawela, both rules were broken by not doing an EIA. The Basic Environmental Impact Assessment report should contain the permission of environment officers for the project to be approved. Otherwise legal action can be taken under the 24 B section of National Environment Act.
he clarified. 
Its a punishable offense to pollute the water. The release of polluted water in to a wetland spreads it all over and pollutes the wetland. Dead fish is proof that the wetland is already polluted. This is classified as an offense and is mentioned in section 23 H, in National Environment Act. Under the section 27 in Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act, releasing harmful chemicals in to any habitat is a punishable offense, if the lives of aquatic species are threatened. Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Department should take action for the impact made on fish.
Releasing harmful chemicals in to Muthurajawela in a way brings death to fish and has become a public nuisance. The Municipality in the area is the first institution responsible for not taking action regarding this issue because it has the power to throw its weight behind the health of the people in their domain. The others responsible are the PHI and thirdly the police. The municipality is bound to take action against the public nuisance in their area that comes under Urban Council Ordinance or some other relevant ordinance.
The Municipal Ordinance specifies that the garbage collected in the municipality should be disposed of in a way, that doesnt disturb the public. Therefore, the Wattala Municipality, which has allowed other municipalities dump garbage on its domain is at fault. he noted. 
The Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources should take action against this. The provincial councils, Wattala Municipality and CMC are responsible. There is a law and order crisis due to the poor attitude of the officials. These institutions have contravened public trust and the responsibilities of public institutions. The public wont respect the law, when it doesnt apply in the same way for everyone in the country. he explained as he highlighted the reasons for the development of this unfortunate situation in the country.

There is a potential threat in the future
- P. Nimal Chandraratne - Director General, National Aquaculture Development Authority in Sri Lanka (NAQDA) 

We arent the ones who dump garbage there. There is a potential threat to the resources of fish in said area in the future, if garbage dumping continues long term, like in Meethotamulla. And there are some issues regarding the quality of water. We have sent a group there and compiled a report and informed about the situation to the Mayor. 
When inquired about the dead fish found from Muthurjawela in the rainy season the DG explained,  There is a heavy organic load in the rainy season and it is natural. With the increase of Nitrogen, Pottassium and Phosperous in the water, an algae forms using all the available oxygen in the water, resulting in the deaths of fish. The garbage problem in Muthurajawela will be sorted out soon. As a professional related to this matter, my opinion is that the ornamental fish breeding centres are harbouring fear because the water is being spoiled there, as a result of the garbage problem. 
The DG rejected commenting of the effect on Negombo Lagoon and fisheries there.

Preview of IUCN - Occasional Papers of IUCN Sri Lanka, No. 4, January 2003,
- Lucy Emerton and L. D. C. B. Kekulandala
Muthurajawela is the largest saline peat bog in Sri Lanka. Together with the Negombo estuary it forms an integrated coastal wetland ecosystem spanning 6,232 ha. The estimated economic value of the wetland is around Rs 726.5 million per year and the benefits mainly come in the form of flood attenuation and wastewater treatment. The marsh supports livelihood activities such as fishing and to a lesser extent agriculture. The location of Muthurajawela in a rapidly developing and highly populated urban area makes it an extremely valuable, yet vulnerable ecosystem.
According to the findings of Lucy Emerton and L. D. C. B. Kekulandala,
The Ecological features in Muthurajawela: The marsh plant community is unstable and represents one of the final stages of succession towards dry land formation. High-levels of human disturbance have led to significant change in the composition of dominant plant species over the last ten years, which in turn had an effect on the faunal composition. The vertebrate fauna includes 40 species of fish (4 endemic and nationally threatened), 14 species of amphibians, 31 species of reptiles, 102 species of birds (including one endemic and 19 winter migrants), and 22 species of mammals. 
Out of the 209 species of vertebrate fauna documented, 17 (9%) are endemic, while 26 (12%) are nationally threatened. The endemic fish species include Puntius singala, Esomus thermoicos,Channa orientalis, Clarias brachysoma and Aplocheilus dayi. Among the amphibians, Bufo atukoralei, Lankanectes corrugate, Rana gracilis and Polypedates cruciger are endemic to Sri Lanka.
I cannot take garbage home
- The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) Commissioner V.K.A Anura
We are issuing separated and decaying garbage in to the compost yard in Muthurajawela. Recyclable cardboard and paper sent to Valaichenai, polythene bags to Dompe and mixed garbage collected from roadside to Kerawalapitiya briefly highlights the present system being operated. Dumping garbage at Kerawalapitiya isnt banned. he specified. 
According to the Commissioner, 120 lorries are transporting garbage to the Kerawalapitiya garbage yard daily. He said that garbage dumping at Muthurajawela was started long ago by the Land Reclamation Corporation.
Responding to a query whether the EIA report had been compiled, he said the Land Reclamation Corporation is dumping garbage there. The Commissioner replied angrily to the question by saying, Where does the CMC dump garbage after the ban limited the sites available  in the form of a question and asked, Can I take the garbage home. 
Garbage is being used as a filling material which is not 100% eco friendly
- Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (SLLR & DC)- Chairman - Asela Iddawela
 We are managing 90% of the municipal solid waste from CMC. And the rest from Wattala and Kaduwela municipalities were used to start the project on June 1 this year. We recieved 400 tons of vegetable garbage per day. 
Replying to the question how they managed the waste after the courts order limited access only to Kerawalapitiya, he said that some part of the portion is sent to a sanitary land filling in Dompe. The garbage is being used as a filling material for the land to be developed, which is not 100% environment friendly alternative, he added. 
Explaining whether they have an EIA report, he said, We dont have any EIA report, but weve got approval from the Central Environment Authority (CEA). 
Commenting on the tender notice issued by SLLR & DC to off shore sand mining and pumping for reclamation and stock piling at Kerawalapitiya and Muthurajawela, under the procurement No/ S/ 183/ 17 he opined that they have received permission from CEA to develop the area. They are going to build a 60 hectare shelter for compost making in Kerawalapititya.

Dissolved garbage enters the canal and affects the whole eco- system
Chaminda Muthukuda - An information officer at the Muthurajawela Visitor Centre 
The garbage dumping sites at Muthurajawela are naturally marshes. Dissolved garbage drips into the canal and affects the whole eco- system. Its alleged that Distilleries Company of Sri Lanka (DCSL) is releasing unrefined waste water in to Dandugam Oya.
The company is allegedly taking cover behind the flood season to continue with their nefarious activities. Schools of fish died due to poisoning. People collected the fish and sold them during the first three days, being unaware of these development. Thus, people have been selling and consuming fish unsuitable for human consumption.
This has been allegedly happening regularly, as the above company had been releasing unrefined waste water during a period of four years. Its easy for them to spare themselves of blame. They wont accept their fault. Those who play tricks use political influence to dump garbage at Muthurajawela. he lamented. 
People assume that piling garbage remotely wont affect the sanctuary. Yet this area consist of marshes and everything is interconnected. Therefore, existing toxins and toxins that are produced from the garbage seep in to the marsh, creating complicated long term issues. he said. 
The public has been invading the sanctuary, filling and building houses. They wont speak up immediately against the illegal activities here, as they also have filled the marsh and built houses in the area. The filling of land is somewhat under control now, but the biggest problem is the garbage. Sometimes politicians forcibly occupy the land. Some time ago, a brother of former minister Kingsley Perera tried to build a hotel, but with the media spring into action, the situation came under control, he explained as he spoke of a problem now having deep roots. 
The Ja - Ela municipality used to dump garbage in the sanctuary. The marsh was filled with garbage and the houses were built on those. The rotten garbage, dripping in the form of juice, dripped into the lagoon and contaminated with Muthurajawela marsh. The water drainage system in Muthurajawela was affected by the highway because they filled every other canal except the major canals. Highways have to be built on piles not disturbing the waterways, like they have done here.
Water transportation in and out of marshlands is crucial. Garbage disposal has been happening here for a long time. Even the Ja Ela municipality was dumping garbage here. The affect of garbage doesnt stop harming the environment or people. he said filling us with the background to the story.

Sri Lanka- Singapore FTA to be finalised
	
The Sri Lanka- Singapore Free Trade Agreement is to be finalized by the end of the year, Minister of Foreign Affairs Ravi Karunanayake said yesterday.
Both visiting Singaporean Foreign Minister Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan and Karunanayake addressing the media in Colombo yesterday said they were working towards completing the FTA which would be modern, comprehensive, ambitious and demonstrate that both countries were open for business.
Welcoming Karunanyake to the club of Foreign Ministers, Dr. Balakrishnan spoke of a better connectivity between the countries which would ensure they would become the gateway to business in each others respective regions.
The bigger the pipeline we build the greater the opportunities for our respective countries. We believe that with the FTA Sri Lanka would be the gateway to South Asia as we would be the gateway for Sri Lanka to South East Asia, he said.
Dr. Balakrishnan is scheduled to visit Jaffna today, where he would take part in an event to hand over books donated from the Singapore National Library Board to the Jaffna Public Library and visit the Orthopedic Ward of the Teaching Hospital where he would plant a tree at the premises.
The Minister will also visit the University of Jaffna to take part in the launch of the Lee Foundation-SingHealth Orthopaedic Development Programme at the Medical Faculty. During his stay in Jaffna he would also call on the Governor of the Northern Province Reginald Cooray and Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran and have an interaction with Businessmen of the Chamber of Commerce of Jaffna. (Nabeela Hussain)

## Title: The  low of higher education
## Section: News Features

The  low of higher education
	
It was in my teens that I first read Robert Pirsigs Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance and came face-to-face with his law which states that The number of hypotheses that can fit a given set of facts is infinite. The statement was anathema for a budding young math and science person. If it was correct, it meant that both those fields of inquiry were going nowhere fast.
Fast-forward to school at the University of Murdoch where my Vietnamese mathematical genius friend Duong Pham and I were taking a course in Structure, Thought and Reality. That was where we both first got to know about Thomas Kuhn, Immanuel Kant, Naom Chomsky and other such philosophers of science (We had both already gotten waist deep in the incompleteness theorems of the philosopher of mathematics Kurt Gdel before we got there).
Discussing, collating, correlating and analyzing was (and is) the great and honorable exercise of all academics and career achievers of worth and we were no different back then. 
So, Doung and I were in the habit of hitting the school pub to discuss outcomes after each class as well as the voracious back reading we did to understand how the world worked both in general as well as when viewed through the lenses of mathematics and science.
One cloudless, blameless day, as we sat there discussing Khun over a beer, he happened to casually say to me (paraphrased), you know Jun, around 200,000 math discoveries are made each year by masters and doctoral students. Each is seen by about 6 members of the students friends and family list who dont understand a word of it and read by about six people on the students thesis defense team who actually understand it and hopefully, give the student the sought-after degree.
No surprise that the rediscovery rate is greater than 70%. That was a shocking revelation that brought home to me the sheer uselessness of our 400 year old education system and its utter waste of human effort, money and resources. 
"How many of us actually use any of the learning we absorb after years of what is tantamount to forced labor in our various portals of education"

How many of us actually use any of the learning we absorb after years of what is tantamount to forced labor in our various portals of education In my years of life, Ive seen very few whose life work can be directly linked to the education leading to their degrees. If what we slave over is useless, then the immediate next question we must ask ourselves is why do this. 
Well, since at the highest level, higher education is largely useless, I must reluctantly recognize that its importance is merely cosmetic. You see, it is fashionable to have a degree or three. It doesnt really matter if its owner is actual a master or doctor of the skill area that he or she claims lordship over.
There is a general perception that they are people of some account. However, if we take a step back and look at the conduct of millions of these people proudly armed with their diplomas, we must understand an inconvenient truth  quite a lot of these folks have no clue about anything at all. 
The best proof of this is that if they were of any worth, our world would not be in the place it is. A place where our doctors, engineers, scientists, lawyers, financiers, business people, policy makers and leaders have actually managed to retrograde development and bring us to our knees.
Pandemics, epidemics, development disasters, natural disasters, money market crises, food crises, climate crises  all point to that uncomfortable conclusion. If a review is done of the sum total of human effort in the last century or so, I have to affirm that most of the things that actually eased the burden of life on people were things created by people who never saw the insides of a university. Diplomas were never the reason why they did what they did and their effort was based on accomplishing something good for the world  not achieving something that was only of good to the industry that overarches all other industries  the social-fashion industry and its attended manufacturing of a vote for things that are mostly made of air. 
Its not their fault. They acquire these three letter dirty words because they feel that those will give them stability, position, recognition, money, power and acceptance in the world. Hitherto, to a large extent, that, indeed, has been the case. However, the world is now well past the time when it can be satisfied with gaseous diplomas or window-dressing degrees. Those bought us a world of fear and alarm. Now, knowledge has necessarily taken precedence over learning and insight has taken precedence over education. Hanging above it all, wisdom has become the great need of the day and folks, wisdom comes from getting ones hands muddied in this kickass reality we call the world. 
On that matter, I can share some great, positive news with you. Wisdom doesnt require us to pass the OLevel or the ALevel or get degrees or masters or PhDs or post-docs. It can be acquired by all regardless of the social, economic or academic sub-stratum to which they belong. Its the outcome of a kind of self-service where the effort is worthy because it; a) is part of a greater collective effort, b) is simple, responsible, replicable and useful and c) requires no validation or adoption by anyone. 


"Diplomas were never the reason why they did what they did and their effort was based on accomplishing something good for the world  not achieving something that was only of good to the industry that overarches all other industries  the social-fashion industry and its attended manufacturing of a vote for things that are mostly made of air"

A wise person is generally not a scientific person or career person. Nor is he or she a discussing, arguing, researching, collating, correlating, analyzing person. Those are things that are the vacuous mainstream indulgences of people who, hell-bent on getting an education for a living, have completely lost contact with life.
Wise people will take time off to grow a chillie plant in a pot instead of complaining that the price of chillies is Rs.1,600 a kilo. They will have a small composting bin on their balcony and not be the cause of the Meethotamulla disaster. They will have a solar panel on their rooftops instead of screaming at CEB tariffs. They will switch off their lights instead of railing at power cuts. They will use public transport at non-peak hours and weekends instead of howling about congestion.
In short, they are problem solving people not problem-complaining people or problem-contributing people and as they proceed down this road, they acquire greater and greater insight into the working of the world. Insight that is impossible for the PhD holding specialists and qualified career people who naively believe that they are worth something when they arent. 
Twenty nine years ago, as I studied Duong over that pitcher of beer, I said (paraphrased) The intellectuals are able, only. The intellectually intelligent are enabled, only. The intellectually intelligently creative are knowledgeable, only. The intellectually intelligently creatively emotionally stable are wise and Doung wisdom cannot be if we are thrilled by our intellect, intelligence, creativity, mental stability and what it can personally give us in this world . 
He grinned, turned to me and said Yup! so, whatcha gonna do doc. I looked him straight in the eye and said You reminded me why I should get the hell out of education because it can give me absolutely nothing of worth. And so it happened. Both Duong and Jun as he was wont to call me, walked out of the convenient, fashionable, useless, conventional route of becoming someone through the stifling, mind stilting, insight killing, resource guzzling, world destroying path of higher education  happily, positively and very productively, never to return.

REUTERS, 18th JULY, 2017- The Trump administration on Tuesday unveiled new economic sanctions against Iran over its ballistic missile program and for contributing to regional tensions, one day after warning Tehran that it was not following the spirit of its nuclear agreement with world powers.
The U.S. Department of Treasury, in a statement, said it was targeting 16 entities and individuals for supporting what is said was illicit Iranian actors or transnational criminal activity.
Those sanctioned had backed Irans military or Irans Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) by developing drones and military equipment, producing and maintaining boats, and procuring electronic components, the U.S. said. Others has also orchestrated the theft of U.S. and Western software programmes sold to Irans government, the Treasury Department said. The U.S. State Department had also designated two Iranian organizations involved in Irans ballistic missile programme, according to the Treasury Department.
