Bandula Nanayakkarawasam (PART II) : The  man and the lyric
	
Childhood encounters have a habit of never wearing off even when we grow up, and this was especially true of Bandula?s childhood, which as he himself tells me was spent oscillating between the demands of his elders and his innate sensibilities. ?There was almost always bound to be a clash of some sort. As it turned out, that didn?t really hinder me from exploring the arts, but it did prevent me from studying them in detail.?? ?
Much of the education he received during these formative years came from newspapers. ?We were always reading critiques and reviews. We didn?t take this as an excuse to side with one school over another and privilege one set of tastes over another. While reading positive reviews of Lester James Peries? films, for instance, we would also read articles and essays lambasting them written by Jayawilal Wilegoda.? Wilegoda, it seems, had been an influence in the field of music as well: ?He was always asking questions like how a popular verse, transliterated as it was from a Hindi melody, like ?jeevithaye kanthare / thurunu wiyali walle / uthura gala yayi adare? made sense when, grammatically, it did not. By the time we grew up, we understood this clash between high and populist art, though we never took sides.? ?
From music and literature, he had graduated to movies. ?I was regularly taken to the latest shows in town by my sisters. They considered me a nuisance because of how emotional I would get at what was being screened. I still remember, for instance, how I cried at Dommie Jayawardena when he sang ?Umba Kiya Kiya? from Hathara Maha Nidhanaya, particularly at those scenes of cows being rounded up for slaughter. I also reacted, rather funnily as I remember, at Asoka Ponnamperuma crying alone at an ambalama in Suhada Sohoyuro, the first film I saw back when I was Grade Four or Five, funnily because I had never even once entertained the possibility that men could cry.? These anecdotes grew on their own accord, and as he grew up, he went up the ranks to the Russian Centre and the British Centre. These were years of culture and counterculture.? ?
Decades later he got to fulfil that desire by getting himself enrolled at the then newly established Sri Lanka Television Training Institute, along with the likes of Sumitra Rahubadda, K. B. Herath, and Douglas Siriwardena. Apparently Tissa Abeysekara had been a lecturer there.? ?
?It was Tissa who taught us the rudiments of cinema and script-writing. I remember him telling us the importance of noting down subtleties in language and expression when writing dialogues. For example, the sentence ?The king died. Then the queen died? wasn?t as powerful as the sentence ?The king died. Saddened by it, the queen died?. It was a whole new world he opened us to, taking us from Eisenstein and his Odessa Steps to the blockbuster. The first film he had scripted, Welikathara, had been influenced by the West. I am glad I knew him.? Due to fortuitous circumstances, however, Bandula never got to be a full-time scriptwriter like his colleagues.? ?
Exceptional voice
What these years and decades proved, on the other hand, was that he had a voice and one which was good enough to attract a following. Story after story has already been told of ?Rae Ira Paana?, which he narrated, in particular how it was ditched by one radio station only to be resurrected by another, and how the criteria used to judge its popularity was in no way aligned with the following it got. But ?Rae Ira Paana? deserves a separate article to itself.? ?What these ratings agencies miss out is that their ?analyses?, no matter how complex and comprehensive they may be, are based on extrapolations hardly commensurate with a program?s actual popularity.??
Those are Bandula?s other lives. There are many of them (among them, his career at Commercial Bank, which spanned branch after branch from Galle and Matara to Colombo and which ended after 38 years a few months ago). Too many, in fact, to compress into one article. So I return here to his primary fascination, with the word and more pertinently the lyric.?
?
I still remember, for instance, how I cried at Dommie Jayawardena when he sang ?Umba Kiya Kiya? from Hathara Maha Nidhanaya, particularly at those scenes of cows being rounded up for slaughter
?I was in Grade Four when I first saw a film. I was also in Grade Four when Sunil Ariyaratne wrote ?Sakura Mal Pipila?. That song, which was briefly banned and caused quite a stir, appealed to me at once. It was in its simplest sense abstract. It taught me how music could be both abstract and concrete. There were verses and lines in it that didn?t make sense. They weren?t meant to. They didn?t explain. They didn?t formalise reality. They parodied that reality. In later years, when both Sunil and the lady who performed that song, Nanda Malini, went political, I matured.? Back when everyone wanted to be a doctor, an engineer, a lawyer, I hence wanted to be a Sunil Ariyaratne.?? ?
?
Russian literature?
Whether or not he fulfilled his desire there, one can certainly vouch for the between-the-lines complexity of his own work. Bandula?s lyrics, I feel, stand out in the sense that they are connected to some personal experience, however mundane. ?It was that little accident at Mahinda College which inspired me to write ?Mal Pipeyi?. Likewise, ?Katu Akule?, the title song of Amba Yahaluwo, was borne out of a request to offer a variation on the ditty ?Rosa Male Natuwe Katu?. ?Rae Wada Mura? came to me when I was driving one night and heard a particularly sad account of a garment worker whose entire life was spent sewing for a pittance.? As these demonstrate, Bandula has not become an ivory tower artiste excluding those who listen to him. On the contrary, his work has been a consequence of experience, the best source for aesthetic endeavours of any sort. ?I owe it here to my encounters with Russian literature, since the Russians were incomparable in the way they viewed life and its shifting vicissitudes.?? ?
Self-effacing, sometimes to a fault, Bandula is almost always on the go. So what is he engaged in today, now that he has left his career in banking? ?I am attached to NSBM Green Campus at Homagama. In fact you can say that I am a sort of consultant there. What happened was that I wanted to commence a program, a series of seminars which were more than seminars, that would impart the importance of aesthetic studies to students. The officials at NSBM loved it. So we organised ?Chathurwida Manpetha?, which essentially delves into three other spheres: the proper use of information technology, the responsibilities of teachers in the 21st century, and career guidance.?? ?
Regarding their main sphere, a key challenge has been to convince students to pursue their love for literature and the arts while placating the demands of their parents and elders. ?Yes, it is a challenge, but then I myself faced it, and whether I liked it or not, I balanced my interests with my career.?? ?
Education, and creative instincts. For some odd, inscrutable reason, they tend to be misconceived as polar opposites. Reminds me of what Marini Fernando, my English teacher from Grade Eight, once told me: ?If doctors studied biology and developed a love for reading and poetry, they would be better human beings and professionals in their field.? Perhaps, above everything else, that?s the message ?Chathurwida Manpetha? seeks to deliver. We can?t really be sure. In any case, we can guess. And while guessing, we can wish Bandula, and his team, the very best. All the way.? ?

## Title: Concerns over  NFC taking over film distribution

Concerns over  NFC taking over film distribution
	
The sudden decision to take the distribution of local films under the purview of the National Film Corporation (NFC) is highly talked and debated. Prior to the decision, the distribution of local films was handled by five agents, including the National Film Corporation (Rithma Circuit), and four private companies such as EAP Films and Theaters Pvt. Limited (EAP), Movie Producers and Importers Pvt. Limited (MPI), Cinema Entertainment Pvt. Limited (CEL) and Lanka Film Distributors Pvt. Limited (LFD).? ?
The National Film Corporation was the responsible body for film distribution from 1972 to 2001. Then, the private sector was granted the authority regarding film distribution at the dawn of the 20th century under the Government circular in 1997 (DMS 360/NFC/P). The private sector had been carrying out the distribution of films for 18 years.? ?
The private sector had the larger share in terms of distributing local films despite the shares that the NFC possessed. With the ups and downs in the cinema industry, concerns were raised on the grounds that the private companies, who had the authority over the distribution of films distribution, hadn?t been effective nor efficient in the task they undertook.? ?
However, the issue has to be looked at from different viewpoints to portray the real picture of the distribution of films.? ?
?
NFC ?spoint of view
When the Daily Mirror spoke to NFC Chairman Sithendra Senaratne, he said that President Maithripala Sirisena had appointed a Committee comprising Scholars to look into the issues pertaining to the Sri Lanka film industry.? ?
?Accordingly, the committee made 15 recommendations out of which one main recommendations was that since the distribution of local films handled by the private sector isn?t done efficiently, its role has to be revised with immediate effect,? Senaratne said.? ?
According to Senaratne the President had ordered the relevant authorities to work on the recommendations. ?There was a series of discussions with the then subject Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara and even with the subject Minister in office Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe. The final discussion was held on June 18 with the participation of film directors, producers, theatre owners and representatives of film distributing private companies,? Senaratne added. Senaratne said that the theatre owners strongly raised their voices against the inefficiencies with regard to films distribution. They had said that the distribution of films wasn?t done in a sensible manner, hence the industry facing inconveniences. Senaratne said that a couple of theatre owners, who wished to remain anonymous, had emphasized that they have been subject to injustice. This is due to the monopoly present in the distribution of films. Theatre owners had said that the distribution of films should come under the purview of the government.? ?
?There are 177 film halls in Sri Lanka out of which 64 are operated by the NFC (Rithma Circuit) whereas the rest (113) are operated by the private sector,? Senaratne added. They had opined that the distribution of films should come under the purview of the Corporation and be regulated with appropriate remedies.? ?
?We firmly believe that we will be able to offer a satisfactory service in distributing films and work towards the uplifting of the Sri Lanka cinema industry,? Senaratne added.? ?
?
Fury of ?then? film distributors?
The film distributors are vehemently against this lopsided decision to place the distribution of local films under the purview of the NFC.? ?
Film producer Sunil T. Fernando said during a news briefing that NFC?s decision would further put the film industry in jeopardy.? ?
?Film distributors are exposed to a massive risk as a result of this decision. The NFC didn?t consult us before they took the decision. We, as people who have a passion for the Sri Lanka film industry, oppose this decision,? Fernando opined. Fernando said that the NFC is currently making a colossal loss. ?It owes us millions. At the same time, there are more than 80 films which are yet to be released. Given such a situation how could we place our trust on the NFC,? asked Fernando.? ?
Fernando acknowledged that there had been injustices caused in terms of exhibiting and the distribution of films.? ?
?
should point out where we have gone wrong, says EAP
EAP Executive Director Kasun Jayawardhane said they couldn?t fathom as to why the NFC accuses the private sector of being inefficient. We have been doing the film distribution to a satisfactory extent.??
?It is unfair to say that the film industry is confronted with these issues due to the mismanagement of the private sector. If the NFC says that we are inefficient, give us an opportunity to mete out justice and carry out film distribution in a better way,? Jayawardhane said.? ?
?
New association?to lobby against NFC?s move
Sri Lanka?s film theatre owners, managers and film producers formed a new association called Lanka United Film Producers, Distributers & Exhibitors Association to lobby against the move made by the NFC.? ?
It was unanimously decided to form a new association for the industry comprising key people representing three sectors such as private film distributors, film exhibitors and film producers to address the key issues of the film industry as a joint forum.? ?
The new association is expected to meet the President and the subject Minister to discuss the consequences to the film industry regarding the taking of this decision without consulting film industry experts.? ?

Enjoining order over NFC?s decision?
The Colombo District Court issued an enjoining order, valid till July 12, preventing the National Film Corporation from taking over the task of distributing local films. This is following a complaint lodged by the EAP, CEL, MPI and LFD film circuits.? ?
However, Higher Education & Cultural Affairs Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said submissions would be filed on the enjoining order issued by the Colombo District Court.? ?
?The decision taken to allow the NFC to handle film distribution was taken on the grounds that the private sector created a monopoly which has led to a catastrophe in the Cinema Industry. We want to protect the film industry and for that we need the cooperation of all stakeholders,? Rajapakshe told at a news conference. He said that they had had a series of discussions with President Sirisena regarding the issue. The president had promised to render his support and also grant tax concessions to the film industry.? ?
?
Film directors voice their concerns?
Film director Bennett Rathnayake said that the decision taken by the NFC was timely and applicable.? ?
?The film industry is plagued by considerable issues. If this decision is to be productive a separate monitoring body or unit should be formed at the NFC,? Rathnayake said.? ?
?It?s fitting to form a new unit at the NFC comprising 12 or 15 persons who are equipped with the latest technology and administrative knowledge,? Rathnayake added. ?It would be more convenient to introduce an E-Ticket option (electronic ticket) which would ease the process of issuing tickets,? Rathnayake said.? ?
He called upon the NFC to maintain accepted standards when making films.? ?
Meanwhile, director and script writer Somaratne Dissanayake told at a news briefing held recently that the decision taken by the NFC was an optimistic move. ?This would revive the Sri Lanka film industry. The NFC isn?t as inefficient as it used to be in the early 20s. I hope the NFC has the potential to take on this responsibility and render a better service to the film industry,? Dissanayake added.? ?
?
Views of artistes?
Veteran actor Ravindra Randeniya said at a media briefing that he was totally opposed to the film distribution being handled by the private sector because it had caused the downfall of the film industry.? ?
?The monopoly created by the private sector is the root cause of the prevailing crisis in the film industry. The NFC taking on the authority of film distribution would help uplift the film industry,? Randeniya said.? ?
Randeniya popped the question that given the private sector had generated an income between? Rs.200-300 million annually through film distribution since 2001, whether it has spent one rupee to upgrade the film industry in Sri Lanka?? ?
Ace comedian Tennyson Cooray told the Daily Mirror that transferring the authority regarding film distribution would not bring about a solution to the problems in the industry and ensure its progress. ?What I suggest is that the industry requires a new start. Everybody who is connected to the cinema and has a passion for it should work towards its welfare,? Cooray opined.? ?
It is important to note that what matters is not who undertakes the responsibility of distributing films, but to ensure that it is done in a way that there is progress in the Sri Lanka film industry.? ?

Fashion Bug continues to brighten Fort Railway Station
	
(L-R) Amith Chandana ? Marketing Executive of Fashion Bug, Samadhi Abeysinghe ? Marketing Manager of Fashion Bug and Champika Nanayakkara ? Station Master of Coastal Line, Sri Lanka Railways.
Continuing their promise to be a socially responsible corporate entity, one of Sri Lanka?s leading fashion brands, Fashion Bug recently announced the completion of the third phase of refurbishment of the Fort Railway Station. Under the project all the signage and direction boards in the station were renewed and repainted.?
The CSR project, which commenced back in 2013 is conducted by the request and with the support of the Sri Lanka Railway Department. Throughout the past years Fashion Bug has been instrumental in maintaining the quality of the signage ? an immense help for the commuters who use the public transport daily.
The Fort Railway Station is the main train terminal and the busiest in the country, serving probably thousands of travelers on a daily basis. It is the main stop for both short and long distance trains. With the rise in the use of public transport by tourists in the need to experience the local feel, the number of foreigners patronizing railway stations has also increased. Accurate and clear signage has thus become crucial in any such terminal, and even more so in the main ones.?
The refurbished boards
Commenting on the completion of the latest stage, Shabier Subian ? Director of Fashion Bug said, ?Fashion Bug has always placed social responsibility at the core of all our operations. Therefore we allocate a large amount of our funds for the many CSR projects that we are involved in. The refurbishment of the signage at the Fort Railway Station is one of our long standing projects. We humbly rejoice in the fact that we can be of help to all the train passengers. It is also an instance where a private corporate contributes to public service, which is the way forward in building our economy and society as a whole?.?
Fashion Bug has initiated many social responsibility projects in areas such as sports, education, health and public service. The award winning CSR campaign, Sisu Dirimaga, is a platform established to serve educational needs such as awarding scholarships and conducting career guidance programmes. Over 14000 students have benefited from this programme since inception. Under Sisu Dirimaga, an annual art competition,Roo Siththam, is conducted, which is focused on harnessing young creative talent and attracts over 60,000 entries from all across the island. Apart from the Railway, the Postal and Health sectors have also benefited under the refurbishment projects, thus projecting their vision of ?Changing Lifestyles? in more ways than one.?

Human Trafficking and the role of UNHCR
	
?
?
805 individuals out of the 1442 stationed in Sri Lanka had been offered permanent residency in USA, Canada and some other countries
	The (UNHCR) is further conducting inquiries regarding the remaining 637 people
	the kingpins of this racket are charging a sum between USD 15,000- 20,000 per individual to be sent as a refugee to Sri Lanka
	Sri Lanka first witnessed the arrival of refugees on May 3, 2008
	Some are visiting Dubai, Maldives, Singapore and Malaysia as tourists while others enter the island through transit visas
	it has been revealed that this racket is conducted on a large scale by a Religious group in Pakistan identified as AHMED sect?
?
Refugees from several countries numbering 1442, who had entered the island illegally during the past period, had been protected by the office of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) in Sri Lanka. These refugees, under the guise of entering the country as tourists on visa facility provided by the Government, were later identified as those seeking refuge in the island. They later revealed their modus operandi which is indeed a racket in pursuing permanent residency. In addition to them there were more than 10,000 who were identified early. They were detected on arrival at the airport and deported by the officers of the Department of Immigration and Emigration.? ?
However 805 individuals out of the 1442 stationed in Sri Lanka had been offered permanent residency in USA, Canada and some other countries. The (UNHCR) is further conducting inquiries regarding the remaining 637 people.? ?
Similar to these people nationals from Pakistan, Afghanistan, Myanmar and Rohingya are continuing their stay in the island. The entry of these refugees, which can be termed a racket, in large numbers has now become a major human trafficking issue. According to the information available at the investigation unit of the Department of Immigration Emigration, the kingpins of this racket are charging a sum between USD 15,000- 20,000 per individual to be sent as a refugee to Sri Lanka. It was further revealed that one of their representatives visits the airport to unsure that they are cleared. This racket is being operated on a large scale and an agent of the racketeers coordinates the operation while residing in the island. His duties are to direct these refugees to the office of the (UNHCR) and also to provide them with board and lodging. Many have attempted to gain entry to the country using faked passports and by changing their religions. There are no records of the number of individuals who are staying in the island and have not come under investigation. The Department of Immigration and Emigration has total authority to take into custody and deport any foreign national who remains in the country without a valid visa.? ?
Sri Lanka first witnessed the arrival of refugees on 03rd of May 2008. They were nationals of Bangladesh and had arrived via the Mullaitivu coast. On their arrival they had been taken into custody by the Sri Lanka Navy and steps were taken to deport them.? ?
Easy operation
The racketeers had identified Sri Lanka as a country where the racket of human trafficking can be easily operated. This they have done by taking into its consideration the geographical location. The racketeers are fully aware that the rules and regulations applicable to foreign nationals are minimal. Therefore after obtaining visas for about four weeks or a month these individuals, on arrival, initially forward an application to the UNHCR seeking refuge status. This step prevents the Department of Immigration Emigration from taking any action to arrest them. The UNHCR office then protects them and provides them with board and lodging. This office looks after the educational facilities of the children.? ?
These nationals in the future are likely to request for political asylum claiming that they are unable to live in their countries due to political and economical hardships. The last group that entered the country illegally did so in 2014 and they were taken into custody. Since then no one who has registered with the UNHCR has been taken into custody by the Department of Immigration and Emigration. Presently most of them are residing in the Negombo area in rented out premises.? ?
With the tightening of investigations by the Department of Immigration Emigration these groups are seeking alternatives. Some are visiting Dubai, Maldives, Singapore and Malaysia as tourists while others enter the island through transit visas and obtain the protection of the UNHCR.? ?
When inquiries were made regarding this matter from the Visa and Provincial Controller of the Department of Immigration and Emigration Chaminda Hettiarachchi, he said that though the Sri Lankan authorities haven?t signed the agreement of the United Nations on refugees, as a member country of the United Nations Sri Lanka is morally bound to consider the plight of these refugees on humanitarian grounds and offer them protection. Therefore once they are registered with the UNHCR they cannot be taken into custody. Hettiarachchi added that there is no possibility of them entering the country illegally. He said that he was unable to comment on the matter with regard to the illegal entry of refugees as it involves state diplomatic relationships.? ?
Through the investigations conducted by the officials of the Department of Immigration and Emigration it has been revealed that this racket is conducted on a large scale by a Religious group in Pakistan identified as AHMED sect. Some groups using their relationship with certain Embassies had tried to influence the officials of the Department of Immigration and Emigration and have been successful in obtaining the release of some of them.? ?
Officials loaded with work
The human trafficking observed in Asia is also operative in Malaysia, but as there is a rigid policy enforced in those countries, the racketeers focus their attention more on Sri Lanka. Therefore assigning immigration officials to Karachi and Islamabad in Pakistan had been? considered in order to avert this trafficking menace. This decision was taken because those who obtain visas on arrival have to be checked during a very short period at the airport. As a result these refugees easily gain access to a country. When a number of flights arrives at the airport at the same time and due to the work load of clearing passengers on arrival becoming more demanding and time consuming, the delay that follows has assisted these groups to enter the country. Therefore the measure of checking their visas in the country of departure would provide officials with the facility of checking their documents prior to them starting their travelling.? ?
There are reports suggesting that there are very powerful personalities behind this racket. Some of them include the politicians of this country. With the intensified checking conducted at the island?s airport these groups are attempting to make use of the sea routes to migrate into the country. This had prompted the department to set in motion a special security plan to arrest this situation. This procedure sees the deploying of officials in Tourist Navy Crafts.? ?
When a group of officers from the Department of Immigration and Emigration met President Maithripala Sirisena recently, they had requested that a selected group of officers from the department be enlisted in the Sri Lankan Embassies. The President had said that as there appears to be a lack of confidence in about 50% of the officers serving at these embassies they are to be removed shortly. The President had added that their request would be considered in the future. This meeting was also attended by Minister of Internal Affairs S.B. Navinna.? ?
The Rohingya refugees, who came under the spotlight recently, have received permission to settle down permanently in a suitable country. Sri Lanka had in this manner earned the reputation as a country for racketeering. There is a continuous arrival of groups to the country seeking political asylum.? ?
?
?
?The Investigation Unit of the Department of Immigration and Emigration has cautioned that there is a possibility of Sri Lanka being used by ISIS and Al Qaeda terrorist?s organizations as a centre to operate from. This is because they too believe that Sri Lanka is geographically ideal for this kind of activity. This was amply proved by the detection of foreign currencies, Gold, Medicinal Herbs, Drugs and other prohibited stuff in large numbers at the airport during the recent past. Air and sea passages had been used by the racketeers for their activities. During certain instances they had found some state officials conniving with these racketeers.? ?
It?s very peculiar to note that most of the emigrant refugees hail from Pakistan and are political emigrants. Some of them after obtaining registration with the UNHCR find employment as workers. The assistance offered by the representatives of these racketeers had helped the refugees to find employment. Despite the applications forwarded by them seeking refugee status from the UNHCR had been rejected they continue with this application process submitting false information. The majority of these individuals hold the view that once setting foot in Sri Lanka it is very easy for them to migrate into other countries.? ?
Despite the measures taken to control the issue and other security systems being in place, these emigrants adopt systems to counter all these moves.? ?
This has affected the visa system now offered to genuine travellers. The Goverment?s intention is not to tarnish Sri Lanka?s image in its dealings with Pakistan, Myanmar and other countries. Sri Lanka is presently bent on increasing tourist arrivals. The number of emigrants, who enter the country illegally, is also added to the number of tourist arrivals. Meanwhile there are many emigrants, who had entered the country illegally, and are now employed in various projects as workers.? ?
When Government Department In-charge of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) Shantha Kulasekera was contacted, he said that the organization?s responsibility is to protect the Sri Lankan border by preventing illegal emigration.? ?
Several projects had been introduced to the Department of Immigration and Emigration. Implementing those projects had been conducted by the Government of Sri Lanka.? ?
?The aim of these projects was to increase tourist attraction in the country. But there is the issue of tourists arriving as refugees. Several incidents have been reported with regard to tourists arriving as emigrants from countries like Bangladesh, India and Nepal.,? Kulasekera said.? ?
Therefore, every country should see that it is benefited when arranging visas,? he said.? ?
?
?
Sri Lanka is morally bound to consider the plight of these refugees on humanitarian grounds and offer them protection
?
Govt. officials behind racket?
When this matter was posed to reputed Attorney Laxhan Dias, he said that as Sri Lanka hasn?t signed the United Nations Agreement on refugees, no refugee had been welcomed in keeping with International regulations. However with the establishment of an office of UNHCR in Sri Lanka the office has intervened in this matter.? ?
It?s evident that this racket is not only operating in Sri Lanka, but is also present in countries like USA, Norway, South Korea and Europe. Dias also pointed out that this human trafficking racket would not in any way affect the country. He also added that this issue wouldn?t negatively affect the state nor the economy. It?s reported that presently there are nearly four million refugees in Malaysia. No country in the world accepts all these people who seek refugee status. It?s known that there are Government officials and racketeers, belonging to various organizations, behind this racket.? ?
If an individual continuously states that he is unable to live in a country, the UNHCR intervenes and finds him a suitable country to live in. If a country enjoys total democracy there is no need to emigrate to a another country. During the recent past there have been many in the political field who sought security for their lives and illegally emigrated to other countries. Even at present there are more than 100,000 Sri Lankans living in India as refugees. However it?s the responsibility of the UNHCR to protect any person who seeks asylum in another country through Sri Lanka. This is done by adhering to stringent regulations. However refugee status cannot be obtained by producing fake documents. If refugees don?t enter the country as tourists, the Department of Immigration and Emigration has the right to turn them back, Attorney Dias stressed further.? ?

## Title: Improving the Gem & Jewelry Industry ? Challenges to Overcome, Opportunities to Seize

Improving the Gem & Jewelry Industry ? Challenges to Overcome, Opportunities to Seize
	
Mr. A.H.M. Imtizam - Chairman of the SLGJA
The history of Sri Lanka?s Gem and Jewelry industry goes back thousands of years. Over the centuries the country has gained for itself a standing as one of the most popular sources of gemstones and jewelry of the best quality. With the approach of the premier annual event of the industry ? the FACETS International Gem & Jewelry Exhibition ? in September, organized by the Sri Lanka Gem & Jewelry Association, the entire industry is abuzz with anticipation and excitement.?
We met up with the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Gem & Jewelry Association, Mr. A. H. M. Imtizam to discuss his views on the history and current status of the industry.?
Describing the journey of the Sri Lankan Gem & Jewelry industry following its inception, Mr. Imtizam explained, ?The gem industry has a long tradition going back to our ancient kings. It has provided a livelihood for thousands of people and is replete with stories of rags to riches. The industry continues to function under a system of profit sharing between the owner of the pit and the workers, which has been described as one of the best cooperative systems in the world. Today the industry is on par with that of any country.?
??Sri Lanka is and has always been the source of most of the existing varieties of gem stones. The industry boasts a proud history of more than 2000 years and over the years we?ve shared our knowledge with many other countries including Madagascar and Tanzania. Today we are capable of processing and adding value to material imported to Sri Lanka from foreign countries.The Gem & Jewelry industry currently utilizes a semi-automated process when it comes to production and manufacturing. Combining local and international knowledge with technology, the industry has fashioned a system that is all our own. We now also provide gem stones and jewelry designs for the watch industry. This calls for work of extreme precision and machinery of the highest standards?, stated Mr. Imtizam, when questioned about the current situation of the Gem & Jewelry industry in Sri Lanka.
Speaking about the major challenges the industry has faced and is currently facing, Mr. Imtizam explained that during the 20th century, the industry suffered a crippling blow when Government regulations banned the import of gold and restricted the trade of gem and jewelry between Sri Lanka and foreign countries. The biggest challenge faced by jewelry manufacturers today is the diminishing number of gold smiths. The lack of awareness in the jewelry villages when it comes to modern technology and machinery is also a significant obstacle in the industry.
On the subject of opportunities met by the industry over the years, Mr. Imtizam provided a detailed account of the Colonial period which saw the further expansion of gem and jewelry commerce. He also explained that prior to the introduction of the Government?s ban on gold importation, the industry had been cottage-based with the practice of gem and jewelry production being passed down from generation to generation. The lifting of the ban paved the way for the birth of a new, sophisticated and more organized form of manufacturing. This allowed the Sri Lankan Gem & Jewelry industry to match the pace of the global community and keep up with international practices and trade.
When asked to describe the contribution of the Gem & Jewelry industry towards the development of Sri Lanka?s socio-economic situation, the Chairman of the SLGJA stated, ?The vast amounts of net foreign exchange the industry earned and its impact on the economy has been significant, not just to those directly connected to the industry, but to all Sri Lankans. The money earned by the average gem dealers now goes into the education of family members and it is heartening to see the children of gem dealers now engaging in other fields bringing about a so called social revolution in the centers of the gem trade such as Ratnapura, Beruwala, Galle, etc.?
Discussing what has and will always set the Sri Lankan Gem & Jewelry industry apart from those of other nations, Mr. Imtizam explained that Sri Lanka boasts a true mine-to-market industry, both domestically and for export in a fascinating blend of tradition, experience and modernization. Mining is primarily done by use of traditional methods, and is small-scale by choice and design as such mines are considered to be less harmful to the environment and a more stable source of employment for more people.?
Lapidary is another area in the trade where the traditional meets the modern in Sri Lanka. Centuries of experience in cutting and polishing continue alongside new technology and design models. The time-honored art of reading rough and orienting stones is integrated with the growing demand of the global market for exact calibration, well-balanced proportions and high quality polish. Thus the Sri Lankan lapidary industry consists of a fascinating blend of high-powered techniques, utilizing some of the world?s greatest expertise in the orientation of rough, and a growing precision cutting and re-cutting sector that maintains the strictest of tolerances.?
?FACETS has provided small time gem and jewelry merchants with the ideal platform to gain recognition among foreign markets, a veritable window to the world. We see many former small timers now doing well as a result and we are extremely happy about this. The NGJA and EDB have played a significant role in constantly recognizing this need. Also foreign buyers on the lookout for that special Ceylon Sapphire now know exactly where to look?, replied Mr. Imtizam when asked for his opinion on howthe FACETS International Gem & Jewelry Exhibition contributed to the development of the industry in Sri Lanka.
On the foreseeable future of the Sri Lankan Gem & Jewelry industry, Mr.Imtizam predicted ?If correctly handled and nurtured without bureaucratic bungling, which unfortunately has been the order of the day, the industry has immense potential in terms of employment and economic benefits.? The trade is ever willing to engage with the NGJA to formulate policies in this regard for the betterment of the industry and the country.?

India to advice SL, others on consequences of engaging with China
	
Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj has revealed that India would adopt a broad approach to deal with China?s increasing influence in the neighbourhood by closely tracking China?s activities and advising neighbors including Sri Lanka on the consequences of engaging with China, the Hindustan Times reported on Sunday.
External affairs minister Swaraj has laid out this approach at a meeting with top diplomats posted in the neighbourhood countries last Tuesday on the sidelines of the Head of the Missions Conference, four officials familiar with the development had said.
The meeting was attended by India?s ambassador to China Gautam Bambawale; and the country?s envoys to the SAARC countries ? Ajay Bisaria in Pakistan, Vinay Kumar in Afghanistan, Manjeev Singh Puri in Nepal, Harsh Vardhan Shringla in Bangladesh, Taranjit Singh Sandhu in Sri Lanka, Akhilesh Mishra in the Maldives and Jaideep Sarkar in Bhutan.
The broad sense in the meeting was that in Pakistan, China?s economic and political dominance had only grown; in Bangladesh, while the Chinese have made huge economic commitments, many in Dhaka were wary of the ?debt trap? Sri Lanka found itself in; in Sri Lanka, while the government remained politically friendly to India, its economic ties with China had continued apace.
After listening to all the presentations, Swaraj said that Delhi?s focus must not be on competing with China on resources.
Instead, she reiterated, India must continue to closely watch all Chinese activities; it must push ahead, with full vigour, its own work, and advise and educate friends in the neighbourhood about how a certain kind of economic engagement with Beijing can have negative consequences for them.

New chairman appointed to SL school in Doha
	
A new chairman has been appointed to the Sri Lankan School in Doha, Qatar, after removing its former chairman on the basis of some serious complaints, Sri Lankan Ambassador to Qatar A.S.P Liyanage told The Peninsula news agency yesterday.
?The former chairman Kumudu Foneska has been replaced with Roshan Sanjaya Balasooriya on July 4, through an official notification issued by the Ministry of Education and Higher Education which acted on the request of the embassy,? he said, adding that it was in the best interest of the school and community.
He said that Stafford Sri Lankan School Doha was affiliated with the embassy. ?After the appointment of the new chairman, the embassy has also formed a steering committee mostly consisting of parents of the school students to look after affairs of the school,? he added.
?The embassy will also have at least five year audit of the accounts of the school,? he said, adding that the new chairman ? Balasooriya ? who is a chartered accountant by profession, would take the school ahead on the way to progress with full support from the embassy.
The ambassador assured the community particularly parents of children studying at Stafford Sri Lankan School Doha that recent changes in school management would not disturb anything rather cause betterment for the whole school system and its educational standards. He also clarified that the school management under new chairman would not remove any employee from academic or non-academic staff from their job.
Ambassador Liyanage also said that the construction work on new building of Stafford Sri Lankan School Doha will start within three months.
?We are set to start construction of new building of the community school within next three months and most likely it will be completed by 2020,? he said while talking to The Peninsula yesterday.
The ambassador said that the government of Qatar had allocated a 10,000 square meters plot of land for the construction of Sri Lankan community school at Thumama junction. ?Due to laxness of previous management of school, the construction of new building of the school could not start timely while Stafford Sri Lankan School Doha is working in a rented building at present. Now, after new chairman, things will be set on the right track,? he added.
The ambassador further said that currently as many as 1400 students were enrolled at Stafford Sri Lankan School Doha. ?Most of them are from the Sri Lankan community but students from other nationalities like Bangladeshi and Nigerian etc. are also studying there.?? ?
He said that after the construction of new school building, for which architectural design was also ready, the school will be able to cater to almost double strength of students.

Pinprick of a pretty bloody racketeer
	
During the past few decades, transnational drug companies often operating as an international mafia are known to have indulged in a multitude of operations ranging from the manufacture of non-essential drugs to medical tests. This has led to a worldwide crisis where the private medical practice ? once regarded as a vocation ? later became a profession and has now become one of the biggest profit-making businesses with private investors throwing their billions into the setting up of private hospitals. Charges are known to be unduly-high with non-essential drugs or tests being often prescribed. For many middle-class families which have no option but to go to the private medical sector, one major illness such as a heart or kidney ailment could lead to bankruptcy.? ?
One of the latest such crimes was what Cable News Network?s Chief International Correspondent Christina Amanpour described as secrets and lies in a Silicon Valley startup. She interviewed the Wall Street Journal?s investigative journalist John Carreyrou who had covered healthcare for about 10 years.? ?
Asked what made him investigate this racket and write the book titled ?Bad Blood?, Mr. Carreyrou said he had read a profile of Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos in ?The New Yorker? magazine. She had soared to fame about one year earlier and he was curious as to how this happened. He was curious about how Ms. Holmes, a Stanford dropout could invent new medical science that would revolutionise the industry.? ?
?I found that hard to believe. But to be fair, I probably would not have done anything with that hunch if a few weeks later I had not got a tip from a practising pathologist in the United States? Midwest. He had also been very dubious of the claims and what was happening,? the journalist told CNN.? ?
According to him, the claim was that company Theranos could run the full range of lab tests from just a drop of blood pricked from the finger. He knew from experience this process was a difficult scientific nut to crack. So, he wrote a skeptical blog item and was contacted by people who also said they were suspicious about Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos. This started the investigation.? ?
Ms. Holmes had got a lot of investors and publicity, riding the wave of Silicon Valley startups. Christina Amanpour said ?Ms. Holmes was a woman and maybe that played into it.?? ?
Journalist Carreyrou said Ms. Holmes had invented a device that could run the full range of lab tests, which, if you speak to experts, means anywhere from several hundred to several thousand blood tests, off a tiny pinprick of blood obtained from the fingertip. It would have had interesting applications and made blood testing much more user-friendly or less painful. ?A lot of people don?t like the big syringe being stuck in their arms, and this would?ve obviated the need for that,? he said.??
As Ms. Holmes claimed at the height of her fame, people would get their blood tests more often and therefore, diseases would get diagnosed earlier and people would have to say goodbye to loved ones less often, the investigative journalist added.? ?
When asked how she got away with it for so long, the journalist said ?I think it speaks a lot about this Silicon Valley ethos where you fake-it-until-you-make-it.? She modelled herself after Steve Jobs, who was her idol as was Apple and the computer industry. Christiana Amanpour said ?She obviously did not talk to you about the book you did. She had the image of someone much older than she was, the way she trained her big blue eyes on you without blinking made you feel like the centre of the world. It was almost hypnotic.?? ?
The journalist said ?I don?t think she dropped out of Stanford at 19 in 2003 with the notion she was going to execute this long con, defraud investors and put patients in harm?s way. I believe that was not her motivation originally. Her motivation was to create a great company, to walk in the footsteps of Steve Jobs and to become a successful Silicon Valley entrepreneur.?? ?
While making use of the marvels of modern medical technology, Sri Lanka also must diagnose issues well and make sure it does not become a bloody pool.? ?

Consistent quality has always been our primary focus when it comes to all Prima products and Prima Stella Set Yogurt is no exception to the rule, which is why the brand enjoys ever-growing popularity among consumers?, stated Mr. Sajith Gunaratne, the Deputy General Manager of Ceylon Agro Industries, Prima Group ?

Right of Reply: British High Commissioner responds to ?World Cup Soccer in Russia and Novichok in Br
	
I am sure that many of your readers were as surprised as I was by your editorial yesterday (?World Cup Soccer in Russia and Novichok in Britain?). May I suggest that they can expect better of your newspaper than to publish as its own views Russian State disinformation about the use of deadly nerve agents on the streets of the United Kingdom? One innocent woman died as a result of her exposure to the Russian ?Novichok? nerve agent while your paper was being printed. No good end will be served by trivialising her murder.
In March this year, two people were attacked in England in what has been described as the first chemical weapons attack on European soil since the Second World War. Analysis by international experts confirmed that a Russian military grade nerve agent had been used. There was and is no plausible alternative explanation of the events other than that the Russian State was responsible. The attacks were followed by a wave of disinformation by Russian officials who put out dozens of alternative narratives. The allegations you set out in your editorial are among the many conspiracy theories that have been promoted in order to distract attention from what was done. Around the world, the same has been happening again since last week?s poisonings.
In my article in your paper published on June 24, I set out my hope that Sri Lanka would join countries from every continent in condemning unequivocally chemical weapons attacks wherever they take place at a meeting of parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention in The Hague that week. Though many countries were the subjects of intensive Russian lobbying to vote against, the international community voted overwhelmingly in favour of strengthening international safeguards against the use of chemical weapons. The result is one we should all celebrate.
I share the welcome you give in your editorial to the success of the World Cup being hosted in Russia. We will all have been touched by the warmth of the reception that Russian citizens in their hundreds of thousands have been giving to football fans from across the world. We must hope that the Russian Government will in future choose to show the same goodwill by preventing, and giving its support to measures to control, the use of chemical weapons everywhere.

British High Commissioner

Right of Reply : DJ?s project 13A and GR?s Viyathmaga
	
?
?
Chief Minister?C. V. Wigneswaran and the TNA are openly advocating federalism
	?
	Vladimir Putin, President of Russia, has tremendous regard for Buddhism
	?
	India intervened and saved Prabhakaran and LTTE in 1987
	?
	None of the SL Presidents allowed the police and land powers to the Provinces
?
There was a swollen headed Brahmin called ?Akkosha Bharadvaja? who, after studying a few Vedic stanzas and theories, thought that he was the only brilliant intellect in the country. This man, festered with venom and ill will, once unleashed his wrath on the Buddha. Buddha smiled and asked him ? Bharadvaja, if you give some food to a person and if that person refused to accept it, what would you do ? ?Bharadvaja said? I will eat it myself?. Then Buddha said ? I refuse to partake of all what you said about me?. Bharadvaja felt ashamed and vanished. Going by the moral of that story, when Dayan Jayathilaka (DJ) called me a ?notorious hawk? and a ?mad dog?? (Daily Mirror July 4, page 10) all what I say to him is ,? I refuse to take it?. So it is up to DJ now either to keep it or gulp it.??
DJ in the above article , referring to a picture of mine with Gotabhaya Rajapaksha (GR) says, that I am an aggressively anti-13A agitator and a Sinhalese Buddhist ultra nationalist. Let us take 13A first. After the 2015 Presidential elections, for reasons better known to DJ, he approached GR and joined Viyath Maga. When it became evident that his sole purpose of getting closer was to push GR towards 13A, naturally there were objections from others. I was of course one of the main speakers/writers against 13A. When DJ realized that he could not achieve his objective he left GR even without informing him. It is natural for a man to get utterly frustrated when he had miserably failed to date, to push the rulers of the country towards full implementation of 13A.? ?
The hardcore federalists such as DJ who argue that 13A is the only answer, should be reminded as to how it was forced on us by India. India intervened and saved Prabhakaran and LTTE in 1987 when it was about to be crushed by our forces at Vadamarachchi. Then they forced JR to accept the 13A which was drafted in New Delhi! So the 13A is made in India, introduced to please the Tamil Nadu voters and separatist Tamil diaspora/politicians. Our country never wanted it.? ?
?
Full implementation of 13A by lifting such restrictions and granting police and land powers means that the country will have independent Provinces in North and East with provisions to amalgamate This is what DJ wants our country to be!!
Although the country became somewhat ?federal? through 13A, the ? unitary ?nature of the country is still being maintained due to a few factors such as the Governor (who can return any detrimental law proposed by the Chief Minister using the executive powers of the President, the Concurrent list etc. None of the Presidents in Sri Lanka, allowed the police and land powers to the Provinces although such powers are included in 13A. Full implementation of 13A by lifting such restrictions and granting police and land powers means that the country will have independent Provinces in North and East with provisions to amalgamate!! This is what DJ wants our country to be!!??
Twenty nine thousand servicemen died, fourteen thousand critically wounded and the rest sacrificed their ?youth? in fighting an enemy who was hell bent on separating the North. After winning that war at such a huge price, the TNA (the proxy of LTTE) with the help of other separatists such as DJ, are trying to achieve politically, what the terrorists could not achieve by unleashing terror for three decades.? ?
Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran and the TNA are openly advocating federalism. TNA and ITAK have affirmed commitment to Vaddukoddai Resolution in 2008 ? their ultimate goal being Eelam. Can anyone justify devolving powers under 13A to areas where political parties foster separatist sentiments? DJ was once a Minister under the Chief Minister Vartharaja Perumal? (EPRLF) who declared Universal Declaration of Independence for Ealam and ran away to India. Hence it is natural for the people to get agitated when a character of DJ?s calibre/ record gets closer to GR.?
?I do not know the reason why DJ was removed from the post of Ambassador in Geneva. But I think he deserves it because he was instrumental in including the 13A to Resolution 11/1, passed in HRC , on May 27, 2009.This resolution, which was adopted eight days after we won the war, praised and congratulated the government for defeating the terrorists and condemned LTTE for using child soldiers and human shields. It was DJ who, on his own, manipulated to provide a clause in it indicating the ?full implementation of 13A?. DJ ,who boasts that the above resolution was a victory during his time, had in fact let down the entire nation because ,even after comprehensively defeating LTTE, it had paved the way for the separatists to demand an independent state in the North, through UNHRC. Even if we had lost that resolution without the 13A it would have been a victory because many countries including Russia and China were with us.? ?
DJ also call me a Sinhala Buddhist ultra nationalist. I am of course proud to be a good Sinhala Buddhist. Good Sinhalese Buddhists are never prejudiced against other communities. In fact they respect all religions and go out of their way to help all other communities whenever the need arises. I invite DJ to inquire and find out as to how I silenced Manivannan, a strong member of the separatist Tamil Diaspora, when he called me an extremist /chauvinist, in the presence of a large number of Tamils at a side event in Geneva HRC. I challenge DJ to declare if he can, a single individual or an organization who says that only the Sinhala Buddhist must have all the facilities and privileges in this country over other communities. DJ is on ? contract? to tell the world that there are Sinhala Buddhist extremists in this country and that is how he is trying to justify his hors d?oeuvre, the 13A.??
?
We know that DJ is anti- Buddhist. When he was the Ambassador to France, the first thing what he did was to remove the Buddha statue kept at the reception. He also had the audacity to prohibit playing our National Anthem at the Independence?Day reception
CM Wigneswaran openly says that Sinhalese have no right to live in Jaffna. He advises the Tamil youth not to marry Sinhalese. He had halted erecting a Buddha statue at Naagadeepa Temple, and demands removal of Buddha statues in Vanni. Yet he lives happily and safely in Colombo amongst Sinhalese with his family. Ananthi Sasitharan (wife of former LTTE Ellilan) and Sivajilingam, both NPC members who are paid by the public, make derogatory and contemptuous statements in Geneva about the ?Sinhala? state, land at Katunayaka and go back to Jaffna safely. Sivajilingam commemorates the dead terrorists, threatens to establish Ealam and roams around in Colombo without any danger to his life. Where are the Sinhalese chauvinists and the Buddhist extremists that DJ is talking about? The very fact, that people like DJ are living in luxury in Colombo without any fear, is ample evidence that there are no Sinhala Buddhist extremists in this country.? ?
But, we know that DJ is anti Buddhist. When he was the Ambassador to France the first thing he did was to remove the Buddha statue kept at the reception of the embassy office. None of the Buddhist prelates in the three Buddhist temples in Paris ever visited the embassy during his tenure due to the scant respect he has shown them. DJ also had the audacity to prohibit playing our National Anthem at the Independence Day reception held at the embassy in Paris. It is up to the public to decide whether a man who has no respect to his country?s identity and the national anthem is fit to represent the country.??
Vladimir Putin, President of Russia, has tremendous regard for Buddhism and recently he said Russia is the only country in Europe which has recognized Buddhism as a religion. We have seen how Putin, even in the midst of a torrential rain, standing straight during the country?s National Anthem. I personally do not know about the objections of the civil societies towards DJ?s nomination as Ambassador to Russia. But I feel it is very unfair by a patriotic leader like Putin, if he is made to present credentials to a person who insults Buddhism and has no regard for his own country?s National Anthem!??

SC grants leave on liquor petition
	
Supreme Court yesterday (9) granted Leave to Proceed with the Fundamental Rights petition challenging the Excise Notification imposing a restriction on female employees in liquor industry as discriminating against them.
The bench comprised Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, Justices Buwaneka Aluvihara and Vijith K. Malalgoda. The matter is fixed for hearing on February 6 next year.
Women?s rights groups and activists are up in arms lamenting that the impugned notification is an infringement of basic Human Rights and dignity of women.
Petitioners say that the impugned notification of the Minister of Finance & Mass Media Mangala Samaraweera is to re-impose and revive most disastrously, the purported restriction/prohibition imposed on the engagement and employment of women in the manufacture, collection, bottling, sale or transport of liquor.
They also say that the restriction/prohibition that no liquor shall be sold or given to a woman within the premises of a tavern, thereby infringing the Fundamental Rights of women to equal protection and equality guaranteed under Article 12 of the Constitution as well as the right to engage in a lawful occupation, trade or business of their choice.
They state that consequent to the Cabinet decision, the Minister purportedly issued the said impugned Excise Notification.
They say that the impugned notification amounts to ex-facie and de jure (legally) gender-based discrimination, infringing the rights of adult women.
They bemoan the Minister by the said notification superseded a draconian and archaic Excise Notification that blatantly demeaned and discriminated against women.
Women & Media Collective, Centre for Women?s Research, Prof. Camena Guneratne and Sulakshana de Mel (Directresses of Women?s Education & Research Centre) and 11 others filed the petition.
They cited Minister Mangala Samaraweera, Treasury Secretary Dr R..H.S. Samaratunga, Commissioner General of Excise Mrs K.H.A. Meegasmulle, Attorney General and others as Respondents. President?s Counsel Sanjeeva Jayawardene appeared for the Petitioners. (S.S.Selvanayagam)

SF: Police can?t fight underworld through cheap tactics
	
Wildlife Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka yesterday said that the Police would not be able to eradicate the underworld by resorting to third grade and futile methods.
Speaking to the media after visiting Bakamuna and Bambulla, where elephant issues were reported, the Field Marshal said some Police officers in his electorate reportedly assault innocent people, file court cases against innocent people after planting drug packets and also demand for ransoms.
?Even yesterday, a child from my area had been taken by the Police and had put chili powder in the child?s eyes.
?His head had been covered with a polythene bag before beating him after hanging him. These types of methods cannot be used to curb the underworld,? he said.
He said the Police should act in an honest manner to control the underworld.
?Curbing the underworld is not an impossible task if done properly. However, the law shouldn't be taken to people?s hands.
?Underworld related issues are not under my purview. We will support the Law and Order Minister and Deputy Minister,? he said.

Thailand parties through the night!
	
Thailand has erupted in celebration following the news that all 12 youth football players and their coach trapped in a flooded cave for more than two weeks have been rescued - in an astonishing against-the-odds mission that captivated the world.
Authorities had been mulling ideas such as drilling holes into the mountain or waiting months until monsoon rains ended and they could walk out, with the rescue chief at one point dubbing the efforts to save them 'Mission Impossible'. ?
In the end, a team of specialist divers, lead by British experts and Thai Navy SEALs, entered the cave and 'effectively pulled' the boys through several miles of waterfilled tunnels one by one - despite many of them not even knowing how to swim.
The final four school boys and their coach, who had been trapped in darkness in Tham Luang Cave complex for 18 days, were today carried out on stretchers as the three-day operation came to an end.
Residents in Chiang Rai, the city closest to the caves, took to the streets to celebrate, with drivers honking car horns and pedestrians dancing outside the hospital where the Wild Boar FC players are now recovering. (Daily Mail)

Threat to ecosystem breaking down surfaces as lands are leased to initiate close to 253 projects   W
	
?
The remaining lands in the Knuckles Conservation Area will be used for projects such as bottled water plants
	?
	lands belonging to the Land Reclamation Board within 500m of the Knuckles Forest Area were not demarcated and they still remain as it is
	?
	Knuckles represents 30% of the water catchment area of the Mahaweli River
?
?
Although Sri Lanka has attracted tourists from around the world for its greeneries and beaches, the authorities seem to have less knowledge on the importance of preserving its resources. While Wilpattu is already being deforested for housing projects, the authorities seem to have identified the Knuckles Conservation Area as the next bait. Several areas around this location have been demarcated for commercial projects which would cause an irreversible damage to the ecosystem. As Knuckles has already been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, disrupting its ecosystem would be a ground for de-listing, eventually imposing a black mark on the country. However, it has also been observed that the said lands which are being given out on lease for these projects are owned by the State Plantations Corporation and Elkaduwa?Plantations Ltd.? ?
In such a backdrop, the Daily mirror? sheds light on the importance of conserving this valuable resource in the island.? ?
?
?
The Knuckles Range also known as the ?Dumbara Range?is located in the central highlands of Sri Lanka. Through a survey done by the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment it has been found that the Knuckles mountain range is home to 128 species of birds, 60 species of butterflies, 15 species of fish, and over 324 species of animals.?
?
Through a survey done by the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment it has been found that the Knuckles mountain range is home to 128 species of birds
?
?
Out of them five species are endemic to Knuckles itself. Due to its significance, the Knuckles Forest was declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site at the 34th Committee meeting held in 2010. Therefore 31305 hectares of land and a buffer zone spanning 35074 hectares were declared as the World Heritage Site. The UNESCO identifies a certain area as a World Heritage Site by considering its value and the fact that it is rare. Hence it funds for further conservation of such sites. However it has been revealed that several lands belonging to the State Plantations Corporation and Elkaduwa Plantations Ltd., will be given away on lease. Moreover, projects with a starting value of Rs. 2 billion will be given 55 years lease period whereas the lease period for the rest of the lands will be 30 years. So far Alakole Waththa near Waththegama town has been identified for an eco-tourism project along with other areas such as Alpe Ella Estate ? Panwila, Gomare Estate - Panwila, Haagalawaththa, Kaallabokka Estate, Midland Estate ? Raththota and Nikoloya Estate.? ?
?
Speaking to the?Daily mirror???environmentalist and Environment Conservation Trust Director Sajeewa Chamikara said that several authorities have tried out different ways to acquire land around the Knuckles Conservation Area.
?
According to the areas in which these lands are being situated the usage of these areas for such projects will have a negative impact on the ecosystem
?
?The lands will be given to projects such as poultry farms, hotels etc. According to the areas in which these lands are being situated the usage of these areas for such projects will have a negative impact on the ecosystem. Through the 1972/1 Land Reform Act, these lands were given to the State Plantations Corporation. It is through the 1975/4 State Agricultural Corporation Act that the State Plantations Corporation was established. Therefore these lands cannot be given for projects which don?t include agriculture-related activities. The remaining lands in the Knuckles Conservation Area will be used for projects such as bottled water plants, hydropower etc. Therefore we have several requests from the Government one being that in the year 2000 during President Chandrika?s tenure, lands belonging to the Land Reclamation Board within 500m of the Knuckles Forest Area were not demarcated and they still remain as it is. Therefore we request the Government to include these lands also into this Area. Thereafter we also request the Government to declare a buffer zone according to the National Environmental Act. The Knuckles forest is also one of the main ecosystems with a rich biodiversity. It has many endemic species and if they become extinct it will be a huge loss. It represents 30% of the water catchment area of the Mahaweli River. This is also one of the main drainage basins of the Moragahakanda and Kalu Ganga projects. This area is suitable for organic agriculture, eco-tourism and similar projects which could be sustained.???
?
?
According to former Customs Deputy Director Samantha Gunasekara the lands in the Knuckles Forest Reserve are situated above 3000 feet. ?There?s cardamom in it?s under growth and the forest is still a virgin forest.
?
The Knuckles Forest Reserve is a sensitive ecosystem and the Government in turn has to acquire these areas and growth them further
?
There are people living below the forest and once poultry farms and other projects are established in the upper areas the water will be contaminated. Then the people will have to utilize this water as well. The Knuckles Forest Reserve is a sensitive ecosystem and the Government in turn has to acquire these areas and growth them further. We have to focus on ecosystem services as well. There are areas demarcated through GPS, but that isn?t enough. There has to be more vegetables and plants grown to sustain the environment rather than giving it away for mega scale projects which would disrupt the entire ecosystem. If the projects continue and the ecosystem is disrupted, Knuckles will be de-listed from the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. If it happens it will have a negative impression on the country. This will affect tourism, foreign investments and other projects which would attract tourists and foreign income,?said Gunasekara.
?
?
Saminda Vidanage, an environmental activist in the area, believes that the Knuckles Forest should be preserved as it is a UNESCO World Heritage site. ?There is no buffer zone marked at Knuckles and when they start giving projects the entire ecosystem breaks down.?
?
They are going to initiate close to 253 projects. But the Government should educate the people about what they are going to do
?
None of the authorities have specifically issued a statement saying that they will discontinue issuing lands. The President who is also the Minister of Environment should speak out on this issue because it is more important that whether the two elephants should be at Sinharaja or not. They are going to lease out16 lands for poultry farms, water bottling plants and power generation plants. They are going to initiate close to 253 projects. But the Government should educate the people about what they are going to do. In most instances the people are not aware of what is happening around them,?said Vidanage.?
?
Minister of Public Enterprise and Kandy Development Lakshman Kiriella was blamed for giving away land around the Knuckles Conservation area. However he denied all allegations and stated that there has been no such move. He further challenged all parties to present him with proof in the event such an activity has taken place. Speaking to the Daily mirror Ministry Secretary Ravindra Hewavitharana said that the Ministry has instructed the companies to not violate any environmental laws.?
?
We also issued another letter asking them to get environmental clearance from the authorities before they proceed
?
?None of these companies have started projects within the conservation area as alleged. We have received 257 proposals from various companies and most of these projects are quite small spanning from 10-15 acres for cattle rearing, pepper cultivation and other industries. We also issued another letter asking them to get environmental clearance from the authorities before they proceed. We have categorically asked all institutions to follow these instructions we have issued,?said Hewavitharana.?
?
?
Several attempts to contact the State Plantations Corporation and Elkaduwa Plantations Ltd.proved futile.

Two Lankans jailed to 8 months over fake passports
	
Two Sri Lankan men were sentenced to eight months' jail last Thursday for owning fake British passports, the Singapore Straits Times reported.
Nagamany Kangatharan, 46, and Kandasamy Niththiyananthan, 27, were nabbed by Singapore Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officers at the transit area of Changi Airport Terminal 3 last month.
In a statement yesterday, ICA said Nagamany and Kandasamy were seeking employment outside of Sri Lanka, and had sought help from a Sri Lankan agent to make the arrangements.
Investigations revealed that the agent arranged for their trip to London via Singapore at prices of between 330,000 Sri Lankan rupees (S$2,800) and one million rupees.
The duo flew from Colombo to Singapore using Sri Lankan passports, arriving on June 18. The next day, they met a Malaysian man, Ihsan Ismie Ishak, 31, who handed them the fraudulent British passports.
The passports contained the two men's photos but had particulars that did not belong to them.
At Changi Airport Terminal 1, Nagamany attempted to collect his boarding pass at the check-in counter while Kandasamy observed him.
However, Nagamany was seen leaving the counter hastily, as the ticketing officers took longer than usual to process his boarding pass.
Both men then decided to abort their travel plan to London and return to Colombo via Terminal 3.
They met Ihsan Ismie at Terminal 3's transit area, but the trio were arrested by ICA officers who had received information about the case.
Ihsan Ismie was sentenced to eight months' jail on June 28, the ICA statement said.
The authority said it takes a serious view of those who possess fraudulent travel documents or abet others in committing the offence. Those found guilty may be sentenced to a maximum of 10 years in prison, fined up to $10,000, or both.

## Title: Why should we be worried about Vijayakala?s romance with the LTTE?
## Section: Opinion

Why should we be worried about Vijayakala?s romance with the LTTE?
	
State Minister for Women and Children?s Affairs, Vijayakala Maheswaran has called for the resurrection of the LTTE to give dignity and order to Tamils.?
?All of you know how our people lived before 2009-05-19. When comparing with today?s situation, it seems the LTTE should be revived. If our children and women are to come home safely, an LTTE administration is again necessary. What this government has done for the last three years is only returning the lands which were acquired. We thank the government for that. But beyond that the government has done nothing.??
?A six-year-old girl was raped and killed. Our girls who are receiving no support from anyone have only one choice ? to commit suicide. What are we to do? Is it for this that a President was appointed by us after so much toil? The situation is so bad that our children cannot go to school and return home safely,? she has said in a speech delivered at the 8th Presidential Public Service programme titled ?Nila Mehewera for Northern Province? held on July 3 at the Veerasingham Hall in Jaffna. Several government ministers and Northern Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran were also in attendance.?
She later resigned from her portfolio on the request of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. The UNP has launched an inquiry into her remarks.
That was not a slip of the tongue, buoyed by the whistling of the audience. That was a time-tested strategy aimed at exploiting real and imaginary grievances of the community through a communal prism. History has proven that these misplaced tactics were, more than anything else, the prime catalyst of the creation of the LTTE. The current pitiful existence of Northern Tamils and their overall loss of privileged position they had prior to the building of the Tamil insurgency and later terrorism were also byproducts of these rhetoric. Like the other megalomaniac in the South, Rohana Wijeweera who preyed on the inflated economic grievances -- grievances aggravated by an education system which gave certificates but no employable skills, and a welfare system that gave a sense of entitlement but not financial sustainability -- of the southern youth to destroy this country, Tamil politicians from Chelvanayagam onwards have exploited primordial psychosis of the Tamil community to drive a wedge between the North and the South. None of those rambling were a slip of the tongue either. They were well calculated, rational, yet self-interested maneuvering of communal politics. All of which, both in the South and the North, ended in disaster and made both communities to start from scratch.?
Mrs. Maheswaran?s remarks have generated two contrasting reactions. The first, and most loudly stated, was repulsion in the South. The joint opposition and the acolytes of ex-President Mahinda Rajapaksa have upped the ante. That itself may be another populist maneuvering, and also one that is aimed at deflecting the attention from allegations that Mr. Rajapaksa?s election campaign was financed by China Harbour Engineering Company. Still, that is a worthwhile intervention because, as history has proved when such communal instigation was allowed to go unchecked, in this country, you are more likely to end up with suicide terrorists than anything civilized sort of discourse on the conditions that could have provoked such assertions.?
?
Once the erosion of the foundation of the State is underway, and cynical maneuverings to those ends are tolerated, it is nearly impossible to reverse the trend
Then there are other voices, which proliferate in English language websites and cocktail circus. They primarily try to contextualize Mrs. Maheswaran?s remarks in the conditions of crime, poverty and hopelessness of Northern Tamils. Those are the same folks who cried blue murder when a high priest in Kandy preached Gota to become a Hitler or whenever Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thera opens his mouth. So there is an innate prejudice in that quarter towards anything Sinhalese. And most of those folks resemble indecisiveness and idealistically triggered shortsightedness that were in part responsible for the less than ideal achievements in both the economic development and nation building of post-independent Sri? Lanka. However, countries are not governed by idealism. That, if needed, is only possible when you achieve economic conditions of Canada or Sweden -- though even these countries would probably pay a heavy cost down the line for idealistic adventurism. Countries should be governed, and their futures be secured through the policies of dispassionate realism. To navigate the ethnic polarization, States have adopted their own means, which often have trade-offs: In Singapore, ethnic incitement could get you a lengthy prison sentence. Turkey promoted the Turkish identity, at times subjugating the minority Kurdish identity. Those means are not perfect, but they have prevented the proliferation of communalism to the extent that it destroys the fabric of the State.?
Why Sri Lanka had a terrorism was not primarily Sri Lankan Tamils were worse off than other communities -- instead they were better off by most economic indicators well until 1980 -- but because, Sri Lankan democracy and other assorted freedoms allowed instigation of communalism. Why this happened mainly with Northern Tamils and not with Muslims or upcountry Tamils was because the overwhelming primordialism of the sort of Tamil exceptionalism in the Dravidian culture, and implanted here. Same applies to Sinhala Buddhist communalism promoted by Anagarika Dharmapala onwards. (Ataturk could have put all of them in jail, and let rot)?
In Mahathir Mohamed?s Malaysia of the ?80s, where there was (and is) a significant Indian Tamil population, and often disadvantaged, passing the Vadukkudai resolution could have got you the death sentence. It was Sri? Lanka, that sent the instigators to Parliament.?
Once the erosion of the foundation of the State is underway, and cynical maneuverings to those ends are tolerated, it is nearly impossible to reverse the trend. That is why even some of the most draconian laws implemented subsequently to the discomfort of all people, and especially Tamils, failed to deliver the intended stability.?
Sri Lanka brought an end to a vicious chapter on May 17, 2009, annihilating an egregious terrorist group. That was the right thing to do for the long-term interest of majority, if not all people of this country.?
Now the government has a basic responsibility that the discourse that led to creation of terrorism is no allowed in the country. A red line should be clearly drawn, and followed through laws. Simultaneously, Tamil political, social and economic grievances should be addressed. But, one should be discerning enough to understand that some of those hyped-up grievances, such as crime, are not a problem unique to the North. There are, of course, unique economic grievances, due to the long-term consequence of the war, as well as those like Chief Minister Vigneswaran is busy passing ?genocide? resolutions and apparently has little time left to dedicate to economy. Even with the best of efforts, a portion of primordial grievances would remain unaddressed and that if unchecked would gradually give into communal instigation.?
That is where Sri Lanka should draw the red line. It should not relive the folly that had been happening since the independence. This is after all not a matter of freedom of expression. It is a matter of national survival.?

Wily Musharraf pushed weak Sharif into disastrous war  with India
	
?
?
Kargil war (May-July 1999) was a milestone in the history of India-Pakistan relations
	?
	Both countries have successfully conducted nuclear tests in late 1990s
	?
	Musharraf believed that a state of war with India was ?eternal??
?
It was 19 years ago, on July 26, 1999, that the two-month long Pakistan-India war over Kargil in Kashmir ended, after claiming the lives of hundreds, if not thousands, of soldiers on both sides.?
?
In many ways, the Kargil war (May-July 1999) was a milestone in the history of India-Pakistan relations. It was the first war in which the two countries faced each other as nuclear powers, both having successfully conducted nuclear tests in the late 1990s setting off alarm bells in the US, the world?s only superpower at that time.? ?
But most importantly, the war resulted in cataclysmic political changes in Pakistan from which it took almost a decade to recover.? ?
After the war ended in the complete withdrawal of Pakistani forces from Indian territory, the civilian Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif sacked Army Chief Gen. Pervez Musharraf. But Musharraf in turn sacked Sharif and ushered in era of direct and indirect military rule which could be thrown off only in 2008 by a long and hard peoples? struggle.? ?
The war alienated the US so much that President Bill Clinton told Sharif that if he did not withdraw his troops from Indian territory, the US would begin to openly support India on the Kashmir issue. According to The Clinton Tapes, A President?s Secret Diary by Taylor Branch, Sharif told Clinton that if he ordered withdrawal, Musharraf would overthrow him. But? Clinton told him bluntly that it was Sharif?s problem not his.? ?
For Sharif, the choice was between the devil (a full scale disastrous war with India) and the deep sea (being overthrown and imprisoned for treason by Musharraf).? ?
?
Musharraf?s unilateral action?
Army Chief Musharraf,who believed that a state of war with India was ?eternal? had secretly launched the Kargil operations without informing PM Sharif and the cabinet. He had decided to fight the war with the army?s own financial resources.? ?
Musharraf?s strategy was: occupy posts in the mountains of Kargil overlooking a key road linking Indian Kashmir?s capital Srinagar with Leh in Ladakh; send Jehadi insurgents into Ladakh; attack and destroy Indian troops rushing to tackle the insurgency in Ladakh; and lastly provide logistic support to an insurgency in all parts of Kashmir. He believed that the Indians would be unable to oust the Pakistanis from their hill top posts, and would sue for peace to settle the Kashmir question in favour of Pakistan.?
Musharraf did not keep Sharif in the loop because he feared that the Prime Minister would not like to go for a military confrontation with India in view of the February 1999 peace pact with Indian Prime Minister A. B.Vajpayee called the ?Lahore Declaration?.?
When Musharraf did tell Sharif about the Kargil operation on May 17, the impression he gave was that pro-freedom insurgents (the Mujahideen) had entered Kashmir to help local Kashmiri separatists to step up their campaign. Sharif later told India Today that he assented to the operation because it was to be conducted only by insurgents with the Pakistani army giving only logistic support without entering India.?
It was Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee who first told him that the attackers were Pakistan?s regular army troops and asked him to pull the troops back, to prevent Indian counter measures. But Sharif could not.?
?
However, as Nasim Zehra points out in her new book: From Kargil To The Coup: Events That Shook Pakistan?,there were many in the Pakistan Establishment who openly criticized the move or raised doubts about the operation.? ?
The Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI)? s point man for Afghanistan and Kashmir, Lt. Gen Gulzar told Sharif? told about the limitations of the Mujahideen, and that the Mujahideen were not present in the area of the operation as claimed by Musharaff. Later, Gulzar branded the operation as ?a blunder of Himalayan proportions.??
Likewise, the head of the ISI?s analysis wing, Maj. Gen. Shahid Aziz, later wrote that the operation was an ?unsound military plan based on invalid assumptions, launched with little preparation, and in total disregard to the regional and international environment.?? ?
According to Zehra, Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz expressed reservations on two counts: one, that it was in-congruent with the spirit of the Lahore Declaration, and, two, that the US would not support the operation.Sharif?s Minister for Kashmir and Northern Areas, Majeed Malik, a former General, asked how supplies would reach the troops under ?adverse weather conditions and in a hostile environment.?? ?
Malik further asked: ?What if the Indians do not remove their troops from the valley and instead induct air power in the conflict theatre?? The Air Force and the Navy Chiefs complained that they had not been consulted.?
?
Defence Secretary, Lt.Gen (Rtd) Iftikhar Ali Khan, said that operation ?would either end in all-out war or a total military disaster for Pakistan.? He pointed that the army should not carry out operations without prior approval from the government? ?
The Defence Secretary confronted Sharif later and asked him two questions: Did the military leadership get his permission to cross the Line of Control (LoC) which is the border between India and Pakistan in Kashmir? The Prime Minister asked him whether the army had actually crossed the LoC. Khan replied in the affirmative and said that no insurgents were involved.? ?
Iftikhar?s second question was whether crossing the LoC would mean war with India. Sharif said that war was ruled out as neither side had crossed the LoC. Sharif had swallowed Musharraf?s claim that only insurgents had crossed, hook, line and sinker.? ?
In another meeting, Defence Secretary warned that escalation would be inevitable as the ?Indians would not take it lying down.? A few ?paper tigers? had started the Kargil adventure without consulting anyone, he complained.? ?
Zehra recalls that Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz also complained that his Ministry had no clue about the operation. Malik protested that he was Minister for Kashmir Affairs and he was shocked that he had not been taken into confidence.? ?
Senior Foreign Office officials in the meeting warned that this operation would be indefensible on global forums. Additional Secretary UN, Riaz Mohammad Khan, categorically stated, ?If it comes to the UNSC [UN Security Council], our position will be undercut.The Chinese along with other UNSC members would simply ask Pakistan to respect the LoC and vacate the areas occupied across the LoC in Indian Occupied Kashmir,? he said.? ?
?
Musharraf did not keep Sharif in the loop because he feared that the PM would not like to go for a military confrontation with India
Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmad expressed concern regarding the possible expansion of the conflict and told the participants: ?I cannot guarantee that India will not attack on the international borders.?? ?
Ahmad cautioned the army against repeating the miscalculation made prior to the 1965 Operation Gibraltar, when the key military and civilian officials had guaranteed that India would not retaliate across the international border.? ?
Sharif himself asked no tough questions himself.?He wanted a resolution of the Kashmir issue and appeared convinced that Op KP (the code for the war )would advance that objective,? Zehra comments.? ?
And Sharif could be an accomplice in Musharraf?s plan.Zehra recalls that in March, a month after the summit with Vajpayee in Lahore, Sharif had approved an ISI-convened meeting to ?upgrade the freedom movement in Kashmir.?
The confident Musharraf dispelled these concerns and maintained, ?We can defend every inch of our territory.? Discussions bordered on being polemical rather than strategic. One of the generals asserted, ?Whatever we may say here, our animosity with India is eternal.?? ?
After this Sharif asked Musharraf if the army had indeed crossed the LoC and if so if he had taken permission for it.Mushrraf admitted that the army had crossed the LoC and that he ordered it on his own volition. But he offered to withdraw from all captured areas if ordered to do so. Musharraf?s approach worked. Sharif said that the army is part of the government and that its actions must be approved.? ?
But by the end of June it was clear that the Indians were driving the Pakistani intruders out and that Islamabad ought to seek American help to pull its chestnuts out of the fire. Sharif told India Today that Mushrraf pressed him to go the US and meet President to Clinton to intervene on Pakistan?s behalf. But that meeting too was a disaster.? ??
