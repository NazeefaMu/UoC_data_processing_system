They were caught napping!
	
The second in command in Yahapalanaya is said to be highly concerned over the lack of alertness on the part of the high ups in charge of foreign affairs, they say. ?A recent event has made him believe that the officials both white collar and political do not keep a finger on the pulse of international developments having a bearing on this country.
A matter related to the LTTE had come up for discussion in the British law making body recently and certain views prejudicial to the country had been expressed by some law makers. However, both our envoy in Britain and the local foreign affairs mandarins had been completely in the dark about this event, according to a report received by the second in command?s office in Colombo.?
Those responsible for this lapse are to be asked to explain and this affair has placed the foreign boss Mangi also in an uncomfortable situation, informed sources say. ? ? ??

A dark lining in a silver cloud!
	
The new strongman left for the UN to attend the 70th sessions of the UNGA on September 24. By the way, his predecessor used to attend the UN sessions in his day with a jumbo retinue. However, the new strongman had restricted his entourage to about 30, less than one third the number that usually accompanied the former strongman.?
None of the delegates who accompanied the new strongman this time round was allowed accommodation in high end hotels like Astoria. The entire delegation including the new strongman had checked in to Hotel Hyatt known for its moderate charges.?
Expensive limousines were not hired either as on previous occasions for the delegates to go about on duty. Instead, five Subaru jeeps hired had met all transport needs of the delegates, they say. ?Separate vehicles had been made available for the use of the new strongman and the Ministerial ones. But they all had made it to the UN headquarters by foot. In fact, it was only a five minutes? walk from the hotel where they were staying, they say. ?
Nevertheless, certain matters related to our official delegation to the UN have drawn flak from some quarters. For instance, some have questioned the rationale behind the inclusion of certain persons sans any official status in the delegation.?
Meanwhile, the choice of yahapalanaya representatives to be present at the KIA to welcome the new strongman on his return home from the UN has raised eye brows in high echelons of the government. A source close to the yahapalanaya top brass observed that certain close friends of the new strongman were conspicuous by their absence at the airport reception for the obvious reason that they had been ignored when sending out invitations.?

A limousine too good to part with!
	
This Ministerial one is a big-mouthed politico hailing from the hills. Once he had to spend a holiday in the main state-run lodge for talking out of turn. He was luckless at the recent general poll, but was back in luck soon, when he was hand-picked for a national list seat in Diyawanna.?
Though he was assigned a new portfolio under Yahapalanaya Two, he continued to use the limousine given to him when he was in Yahapalanaya One. The vehicle was new and was in a sound condition, but the four tires had worn out. Therefore, he ordered his aides to replace the old tires with new ones without delay.?
The Ministerial aides immediately sought in writing the main secretarial one?s approval for the purchase of four new tires, but the latter laid aside the request.?
Nettled that the approval was not forthcoming, the Ministerial one asked the Secretarial one why he rejected the request. The Secretarial one meekly replied: ?Sir, this vehicle doesn?t belong to our Ministry. The cost of the new tires should be borne by the Ministry that owns it. If I approve the expenditure on the new tires for this vehicle, one day I may have to face the music. They may prosecute me and send me to jail?? ??If you can?t purchase new tires for my official vehicle, how can I go about my official duties?? the Ministerial one asked suppressing his anger.
?Sir, I will certainly approve the proposed purchase, if you give me necessary instructions in writing,? replied the official.?
The Ministerial one issued written instructions as suggested and he now happily goes about on new tires though the vehicle belongs to another Ministry!

There is a rumour rife in political circles these days that an archetype of former highflier Saji is haunting the corridors of power.
This worthy, a ?politico like his archetype who was close to the former strongman has deployed his agents in key points in administration to co-ordinate his shady activity, they say.?
Diyawanna members of yahapalanaya who discuss this character in hush-hush tones believe that an exposure of his true colors is sure to take the nation by surprise! ?

?and he had to escape through a rear exit!
	
A wedding held in a five star hotel in the city recently witnessed a group of Ministerial ones chit-chatting in a jolly good mood. The opposition chief in Yahapalanaya One, now the transport boss, the most vocal of all regaled his colleagues with many an amusing anecdote. However, he made it a point to recount in-between certain funny doings by big guns who previously held key positions in the Ministry he is in charge of now. ? ?
?It may take one whole night for me to recount how tenders in respect of various projects had been awarded,? he began. ?Some tenders had been awarded to their family members? I visited one CTB workshop with 137 technicians on its roll. But they had repaired only two buses in one month? There will be no more CTB to be run, if the Treasury fails to release adequate funds next month to keep it going?? He added after a pause for emphasis: ?A person who should take the rap for such a mess was vying for the main chair in the opposition!? ?The Ministerial one on this occasion thankfully had a nodding attentive audience.
?
However, the Transport Boss found himself in a highly awkward situation when he related the same story with more spice added at a different event later. The occasion was a meeting of CTB depot heads held at a well-known hall in Narahenpita. ?The audience had turned restive when the Transport Boss was referring to the corruption rampant in the board in the recent past. Suddenly someone from the audience shouted: ?Where were you when all those shady things were happening in the Ministry and the CTB?? ?And that set the ball rolling! More questions and jeers from the audience. They were all shouting at the Ministerial one as if they were letting off a long-suppressed anger.
When it appeared that the situation was getting out of control, Police whisked off the Ministerial one through a rear exit!?

Did he act in haste to repent at leisure?
	
Nine opposition political parties held a joint media briefing at the political temple in the city recently. The politico who was invited to represent the Betel leaf party at this show had a hard time in deciding whether to attend it or not, they say.?
	?
The man, looking after a Colombo district constituency closer to Gem City, of course, was quite keen on taking advantage of the event to win more votes by being critical of the Yahapalanaya two. But he had a nagging fear that move could lead to his losing the position as the chief organizer of the electorate he had been tending for years!?
Finally the fear of losing the organizer post gave way to his strong desire to cut a figure before his voters and he attended the media briefing.?
At the media briefing the politico went into pyrotechnics over the acts of omission and commission of the regime. However, his courage and buoyancy oozed out when he remembered soon after the enormity of the risk he had taken. These days he is said to be in a blue funk wondering whether he had unwittingly cleared the way for his bitter rival long eying his organizer post to achieve his goal!?

Disgruntled politico to turn state witness against his former boss?
	
This former Diyawanna member, an ardent follower of the former strongman, in a bizarre U-turn is out gunning for the latter, they say.
	?
This politico who had to spend a few weeks in the main state-run lodge for his doings in the past, is nursing a grudge against the former strongman mainly because the latter failed to use his influence to grant him nomination to contest the August 17 general poll. He also has been blaming the former boss for not doing enough to prevent the law being enforced against him. The man is now poised for a political somersault, they say. ?Some Yahapalanaya Ministerial ones say that the disgruntled politico had quite openly expressed his sentiments and future plans during his recent visit to the home turf of the former strongman.
But certain intimates of the unhappy one maintain that he has not agreed to give evidence against his former mentor. However, all interested parties eagerly await the politico?s next move for it could be another surprise!?

Facing job hunting lackeys has unnerved them all!
	
A group of Green and Blue party Diyawanna members found themselves engaged in an animated colloquy in the House lobby the other day. ? The topic that figured at this discourse was one of shared concern for them all: How to find jobs for the supporters who campaigned for them at the recent poll at the risk of losing their limb or life.
Addressing a Betel leaf party Ministerial one, a Green party colleague from Rajarata said: ?Our supporters are now coming after us seeking jobs. But all Ministries that can provide jobs have gone to your party people.? ??You are sadly mistaken, machang,? replied the Betel leaf colleague from the West. ?Our Ministries are no better than yours. All institutions coming under my purview are beggarly ones just existing hand-to-mouth!??
?Accept the reality, machang,? another Green party one put in. ?There are six Ministries that can easily generate jobs. Five of them are being handled by your party people.?
?That?s quite true,? a Green party colleague agreed. ?Of the six job spinning Ministries, we have got only Education.?
Another Green party member tried to cheer up his unhappy colleagues: ?Our party is back in power after a long spell. So let us be patient?There might be better times ahead!?

PMK MP Anbumani Ramadoss on Monday has said he was ready to quit the BJP-led NDA alliance if his decision could help find a permanent solution to the problems of the Sri Lankan Tamils, the Hindu said.
Reacting to TNCC president E.V.K.S. Elangovan who asked why he was continuing in the NDA when India supported the ?diluted? resolution in the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) for a probe into the war crimes, Mr Anbumani said the Congress leader was only diverting the issue.
?If it helps the Sri Lankan Tamils, I am ready to leave the NDA. India?s stand shocked me and I have returned a disappointed man,? said Mr. Anbumani, who attended the UNHRC meeting in Geneva a few days ago.
He said even though the UNHRC Commissioner?s report had not used the word ?genocide? to describe the crime against Tamils in Sri Lanka, there was adequate evidence that pointed to genocide.
?An international inquiry will bring out the truth because the report had described the killing of Tamils as a system crime,? he said.
Mr. Anbumani said even now it was not late for Chief Minister Jayalalithaa to hold an all party meeting to prevail upon Prime Minister Narendra Modi to put pressure on the international community to get justice for the Sri Lankan Tamils.

Rs.3 billion sports affair jettisoned!
	
The political boss presiding over the country?s sports decided to hold the biggest international youth sports festival here in 2017. And he got his aides to work out the budget for the proposed event.
A team of aides who worked on the budget, estimated the overall cost of the festival at a hefty Rs.3 billion. And the Sports Boss presented for approval a paper containing the project plan and the estimated outlay to the highest decision-making body. The highest authority in due course received a copy of the proposal with comments from the finance high ups as well. However, the proposed grand event got nipped in the bud when the highest authority immediately pooh-poohed it saying that there were more pressing national priorities on the government agenda than the proposed grand event.
Incidentally, the highest authority, they say, thanks to his brief experience of affairs connected with national sports has already become wary of grandiose plans mooted by political high ups in the sports sector.?

	The Sri Lankan investigative team comprising Government Analyst A. Welianga, Chief Inspector Dimuthu Samaranayake of the STF bomb squad and two CID officers left for the Maldives on October 1 and returned to the Island on Monday.
	A source said the explosive device had been planted under the helmsman?s seat inside the VIP cabin and that the Maldivian government had been conveyed this information verbally.
	?We believe this is not an assassination attempt but a mere warning to the President. The final investigation report will be handed over to the Sri Lankan Government today for onward transmission to the Maldivian Government,? he said.
	Apart from the Sri Lankans, officers of the FBI and Indian and Saudi Arabian sleuths had also investigated the explosion. However, according to reports only the Sri Lankan team had completed its investigations.
	On September 28, the Maldivian President escaped unscathed from an explosion on his speedboat while returning to a luxury tourist destination after his Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia. The President?s wife, Fathimath Ibrahim and a bodyguard suffered minor injuries. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
