Foreigners can open accounts with US$500,000
	
The government is reported to have prepared legislation to permit foreign nationals to open foreign currency accounts in Sri Lanka with a minimum deposit of US$500,000 or more.
The legislation titled ?Special Deposit Account? has been gazetted. In addition to US dollars, the other permitted foreign currencies for such purposes are sterling pounds, Swiss francs, Australian dollars, Singapore dollars, Canadian dollars, Japanese Yen, and Euros for the equivalent of USD500,000.
Apart from these seven currencies, the subject minister will be authorised to approve other currencies where necessary.
Meanwhile, foreign nationals including dual citizens opening such accounts will be granted resident visas while their spouses will be issued resident visas if an additional US$300,000 is deposited and their children if minors will be entitled to stay in Sri Lanka during the validity period of the deposit accounts. Account holders will not be allowed to engage in any paid employment in the country while the interest income on these accounts will be exempted from any tax or levy.
The Exchange Control Act will not apply to such accounts. (Kelum Bandara)

Govt. using Gnanasara Thera to delay polls: JO
	
The government is attempting to delay the local government elections by using Galagodatte Gnanasara Thera to divert attention from the real issues, the joint opposition said today.
JO spokesman Gamini Lokuge told a news conference that the government was reluctant to hold the elections because it knew it would be defeated.
He said this government with the help of the international forces is conducting the ?Gnanasara drama? to divert the attention so that it could cling to power.
Mr. Lokuge said a similar coup was hatched during the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime by using the Thera to topple the then government.
Meanwhile, he said the government should not sell the country's resources such as the buildings which housed Nuwara Eliya, Kandy and Galle post offices.
Commenting on the incident where Minister John Amaratunga was reported to have threatened a group of journalists when he was questioned about the garbage disposal issue, the MP said it was the right time for the minister to retire from politics. (Thilanka Kanakarathna and Sheain Fernandopulle)

Indian soldier, three rebels die in Kashmir shoot-out
	
SRINAGAR AFP June8, 2017-
An Indian soldier and three suspected rebels died in a shoot-out along the de facto border that divides disputed Kashmir with Pakistan early Thursday, the army said. ??
?
Soldiers deployed along the heavily militarised frontier known as the Line of Control (LoC) shot and killed the three suspected rebels when they tried to cross into Indian-administered Kashmir from the Pakistan side. ??
One soldier also died in the exchange of fire, the army said in a statement. ??
The deaths came a day after Indian soldiers killed three combatants as they tried to cross into the territory. ??
India regularly accuses Pakistan of arming militants and pushing them across the LoC to launch attacks on its forces. ??
Islamabad denies the allegation, saying it only provides diplomatic support to Kashmiris seeking self-determination. ??
?Both claim the territory in its entirety. ??

The men, all blindfolded and bound, are believed to have been killed and left out in the scorching heat by Iraqi militiamen who are rounding up terrorists. ??
They were found in territory held by government forces, around 20 km from the front line, where Iraqi troops are fighting to dislodge ISIS. ??
Two of the men had been marched a short way into the field, where one was apparently forced to kneel before being shot from behind.Human Rights Watch say the men were likely killed by forces affiliated with the Iraqi regime, who are rounding up thousands of suspects as they capture territory from ISIS. ?

May's poll gamble backfires, UK to have a hung Parliament?
	
British Prime Minister Theresa May appears to have lost her gamble in calling a "snap" election to strengthen her grip on power, and while her Conservatives will likely remain the largest party, they are losing seats, the CNN reported a short while ago.
Results so far suggest that May's party could struggle to retain its overall majority in Parliament. CNN said it's a huge embarrassment for May, who called the early election with the aim of gaining a wider majority.
She argued she needed a greater mandate to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations, as Britain prepares to leave the European Union. Now the tone of those Brexit talks, set to start in just 10 days -- and even May's own position -- are up in the air.
After the result was declared in her constituency of Maidenhead, May gave a faltering speech. "At this time more than anything else, this country needs a period of stability," she said, suggesting she would attempt to form a government even if her party loses its majority.
Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, said the early results showed May had lost her mandate and called for her to resign.
"People have said they have had quite enough of austerity politics," he said, repeating his campaign promises to push for better funding for health and education.
There were upsets elsewhere in the UK: In Scotland the Scottish National Party was on course for significant losses. The former leader, Alex Salmond, lost his seat, as the Conservative Party made some rare gains in Scotland.
The anti-Brexit Liberal Democrat Party did not make its hoped-for inroads. Former leader Nick Clegg, a former Deputy Prime Minister, lost his Sheffield Hallam seat. Tim Farron, the current leader, retained his seat with only a narrow majority.
Commentators agreed the results were bad for the prime minister. "This is a major disaster for her personal authority over the country and the Conservative Party, particularly because she made this election all about her 'strong and stable' leadership," Jane Merrick wrote for CNN. "She made the election a referendum on Theresa May and she has lost."
The BBC's latest projections predict the Conservatives will get 318 of Parliament's 650 seats, meaning the party would struggle to govern alone. But opponents may not be able to put together a coalition to take power.
One of many key questions for the coming days will be what approach is taken to the Brexit negotiations, even if May stays as prime minister.
She had promised a "hard Brexit" if Britain did not like the terms of the divorce negotiated with the EU. She vowed to take the country out of the EU's single market and customs union, essentially a free-trade zone, radically changing Britain's relationship with one of its biggest trading partners.

Mount of Apollo or Sun
	
Human hand ? trailblazer of human civilization ? Part 12
?
?
BY A.S. Fernando.
The Mount of Apollo or Sun is located at the base of the third finger or the Finger of Apollo and on the upper part of the Line of Heart.
This Mount is very significant in that it indicates the success or the failure of a person in life. A person who has no Mount of Apollo would lead an ordinary life ?unknown and unsung.?
A person with a prominent Mount of Apollo is a genius and a celebrity. If the Mount is well developed and pink in colour, the owner would certainly attain very high status in society.
?
Friendly, cheerful and courteous
People with a?? ?prominent Mount of Apollo are called Apollonians. Apollonians are friendly, cheerful, and courteous by nature. They get along well with friends and others. They are honest and trustworthy and are highly respected for their sterling qualities.
?
Recipients of unexpected wealth
Apollonians are wealthy and have more than one source of income. If this Mount is prominent in the hand of even an illiterate ordinary person, he would become wealthy and prosperous. Apollonians receive unexpected wealth several times in their life. Apollonians like to live in grand style. They are large-hearted and are ready to admit their mistakes. They are forthright in their dealings with others and do not mince words in telling the bare truth.
?
Frustrated and poor
If the Mount of Apollo is leaning towards the Mount of Saturn, the owner is a frustrated person who likes to remain aloof from others. Such persons often find themselves in reduced circumstances.
?
A successful businessman or an entrepreneur
If the Mount is leaning towards the Mount of Mercury, the owner will be a successful businessman or an entrepreneur. Such persons are wealthy and are respected in society. A clumsy Finger of Apollo minimizes the favourable characteristics of the Mount of Apollo. Such persons are vindictive and they fail to get along with fellowmen.
?
Many lines indicate?a sickly person
If there are too many lines on the Mount of Apollo, the owner is a sickly person.A person with a prominent Mount of Apollo and a conical finger, is idealistic. Such persons are artists, writers and poet.Those with a square fingertip are artists of a high calibre and they are practical too.If both the Mounts of Apollo and Mercury are equally prominent, the owner would be endowed with a sense of justice and a love for scientific research.

Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews said that no one really expected Sri Lanka to win by beating India in the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 Group B encounter, Indian Media reported today. ?
Addressing the post- match conference held in London last night, Mathews has said he hoped that the victory may just bring back smiles in the faces of the countrymen after the tragic times in recent past where hundreds of people lost their lives due to a devastating flood.
"It was very pleasing for us to give them a win because we had some terrible times in the recent past, especially with losing a lot of lives due to floods and we are very grateful that we could give them a reason to smile," he said.
Mathews said he was happy that Sri Lanka's traditional Papare band was present in full force at the Oval yesterday.
"That's our trademark, Papare. They come all over wherever we play. The Sri Lankan people like to have fun," he said.
According to the Economic Times, Mathews has termed the ambience as if they were playing a World Cup final.
Sri Lanka staged a brilliant run chase to stun the defending champions by 7 wickets on Thursday.
Mathews? side was written off by experts in the build-up to the crucial clash at the Oval, but they ignored the doubters to keep alive their bid to qualify for the semi-finals, the Hindustan Times said.

Relief items with name tags, JO claims
	
Questions were asked in Parliament today with regard to the distribution of relief items under the label of some politicians.
Joint opposition MP Chandrasiri Gajadira asked whether a certain minister had distributed bananas with his name attached.
Minister Gayantha Karunathilake, who responded to the allegation, said a certain group of mischief makers had done this to tarnish his image and added that the CID was investigating this matter following a complaint by him.
"Certain people had posted an image on Facebook of bananas with my name tagged. People in my area know that I am not that kind of a person. I complained to the CID which has identified the man behind this racket," he said.
House Leader Lakshman Kiriella, who joined in the cross talk said it was revealed that a JO MP had employed people to sling mud at certain selected government politicians.
JVP MP Sunil Hadunnetti said Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardhane had also distributed bags of relief materials among the displaced people in the Galle district with his name tag attached.
"Being the Home Affairs Minister, he should have distributed them not only in the Galle district but in all affected districts. Amid the catastrophe there is no need to pump up our image but to make sure that relief items reach all those who were affected," Mr Hadunnetti said.
The minister said he had distributed more than 200 lorry loads of relief items to all the affected districts. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Theresa May refuses to quit despite hung Parliament
	
British Prime Minister Theresa May is refusing to quit despite her disastrous election night as the UK voted for a hung parliament, the Telegraph reported a short while ago.
Mrs May?s decision to call a snap election backfired in spectacular fashion as she lost the Conservatives? majority in the House of Commons as Labour made significant gains.
She is now scrambling to try and form a government, potentially with the help of the Democratic Unionist Party and while the DUP has signalled a willingness to do a deal its leader Arlene Foster has expressed doubts that the Prime Minister can "survive".
Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, has urged Mrs May to resign as he said she should "go and make way for a government that is truly representative of this country".
Meanwhile, even senior Tory figures have suggested she should consider her position.
But Tory sources have told The Telegraph that Mrs May is likely to stay on as Prime Minister because she does not want to allow Brussels to delay Brexit talks.
One source said: "The digging in seems to have something to do with their not wanting to allow Brussels to postpone the Brexit talks on the claimed pretence that 'there isn't a UK Government'."
Mrs May has insisted the UK needed a period of stability as she delivered a speech following her re-election as the MP for Maidenhead. She said: ?At this time, more than anything else, this country needs a period of stability.
"If, as the indications have shown and if this is correct, the Conservative Party has won the most seats and probably the most votes, then it will be incumbent on us to ensure that we have that period of stability and that is exactly what we will do."
As things stood on Friday morning, the Conservatives had won 314 seats, a loss of 12, while Labour had won 261, a gain of 29.
And with 646 of the 650 seats now declared, no single party will be able to secure an overall majority, with a hung parliament now guaranteed.
That means that Mrs May's path to power will likely require a deal to be done with the Democratic Unionist Party, which increased its representation at Westminster from eight to 10.
It has signalled it is ready to discuss working with the Tories on issues such as Brexit and keeping the UK together.

After travelling to the Buckingham Palace for an audience with Queen Elizabeth II following the General Election results, British Prime Minster Theresa May yesterday announced she was going to form a government, despite not securing a majority in the snap election, news agency reports said.
The Prime Minister has said she intends to form a government that will provide ?certainty? and guide the country through Brexit talks.
May said she was confident that the Tories would be able to work together with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) in the ?interests of the whole of Britain?.
May, accompanied by her husband Philip, made a statement in Downing Street after she travelled to Buckingham Palace for an audience with Queen Elizabeth II following the General Election results.
Following an audience with the Queen at Buckingham Palace, the PM said she was confident that she would be able to work with the Democratic Unionists at Westminster in a new administration.
?I will now form a Government ? a Government that can provide certainty and lead Britain forward at this critical time for our country,? she said.
?This Government will guide the country through the crucial Brexit talks that begin in just ten days time.

Theresa May to seek Queen?s permission to form govt.
	
British Prime Minister Theresa May will visit Buckingham Palace to seek permission from the Queen to form a government, the Independent reported a short while ago quoting a Downing Street spokesman.
The article said Ms. May has struck a deal with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to form a small working majority in coalition.
The DUP said the deal would work on a vote-by-vote basis called "confidence and supply" and they would not form a formal coalition.
It follows calls for Ms May to resign after a disastrous election for the Conservatives. They emerged eight seats short of a majority, with one seat left to declare.
"We would consider a supply and confidence arrangement to make sure Theresa May would have sufficient support to keep her in government,? one DUP MP has told Sky News.
Support for the DUP has grown, with the party increasing their number of seats from 8 to ten. The Tories and DUP combined would have 329 MPs in the Commons.
The party has series of demands from the Conservatives in exchange for its support. Among them is an assurance that Ireland is not granted special status after Brexit.
Nigel Dodds, who retained the North Belfast seat, reportedly said the DUP would insist there was no separate deal for Ireland that would in essence keep in inside the EU. The DUP backed Brexit in last year's referendum.
The DUP objects to special status for the region, one of Sinn Fein's key demands, fearing it could break-up Ireland from the rest of the UK.
The DUP, the largest unionist political party in Northern Ireland, said their desire to form a coalition with Ms May is driven by concerns about Jeremy Corbyn becoming Prime Minister.
Mr Corbyn, who has called on Ms May to resign, has well publicised links with Sinn Fein. The Labour leader has said he is "ready to serve" and the party is willing to form alliances with other smaller parties.
Yet even if Labour joined forces with the SNP, Lib Dems, Green Party and Plaid Cymru, it would only have 313 seats, short of the 326 figure it needs.

This culture of impunity should come to an end
	
Speech by the Leader of the Opposition Rajavarothiam Sampanthan made in Parliament on UN Human?Rights Council Resolutions
Mr. Presiding Member, this Resolution has been moved by the Joint Opposition. ?
The objective of the Resolution is the attempted repudiation of the Report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and also the Resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council.
I do not want to approach this matter in a spirit of confrontation. I want to approach it from the perspective of what would be in the best interests of the country and all its people while ensuring truth and justice??
What happened to unarmed civilians in violation of human rights and humanitarian laws must not be confused with legitimate actions taken by the State against armed combatants carrying on an armed struggle against the State.
No one should be allowed to confuse the execution of legitimate duties by a government and the wanton killing of unarmed civilians in furtherance of the political agendas of persons holding high office<U+200B>?
Unfortunately, I do not think such steps are within the competence of this honourable House and I might, perhaps, safely say that it is not the will of the present House. I might say very clearly that the Sri Lankan State is bound by the Resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council and that it is the bounden duty of the Sri Lankan State to implement that Resolution. We should really work towards how that can be achieved without any harm being done to this country. That should be our objective.
??
I do not want to approach this matter in a spirit of confrontation. I want to approach it from the perspective of what would be in the best interests of the country and all its people while ensuring truth and justice. ?
?
The causes and events that led to this situation, to this Resolution being adopted, occurred during the tenure of the former Government. The present Government took over when conclusions, decisions, had been arrived at by the UN Human Rights Council. Not having been able to contain the situation despite being given every opportunity from 2012, the former Government could not have contained the situation when decisions had been arrived at in 2015 by the UN Human?Rights Council.
The former Government was given every opportunity to implement its own LLRC recommendations
	It was the policy of confrontation and refusal to participate that led to the Resolution adopted in 2015
	What happened in the South from 1988-1989 and in the North from 2008-2009 are crimes against humanity.
	I do not think all war heroes were engaged in committing violations of humanitarian laws but some of them undoubtedly committed such
	crimes?
?
The former Government was given every opportunity to implement its own LLRC-Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission- recommendations and conduct its own domestic investigations in 2012 and 2013 up to 2014. It was the policy of confrontation and refusal to participate that led to the Resolution adopted in 2015. This is undeniable and the former Government must accept responsibility for?that situation.
??
This Resolution is frequently referred to as a Resolution against Sri Lanka. I do not agree with that view. It is a Resolution dealing with violations of human rights laws and humanitarian laws committed by both parties to the conflict, the State and the armed rebel group, the LTTE. It is not a Resolution against Sri Lanka. It is a Resolution pertaining to certain acts, not all acts, committed by the two parties to the conflict. ?
One must not forget that this whole process commenced when the then President, Mahinda Rajapaksa, gave a commitment to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, on the May 26, 2009 when the Secretary-General visited Sri Lanka, to the effect that Mahinda Rajapaksa, the President and the Sri Lankan Government would address the question of accountability. That was a commitment very clearly made by the then President to the Secretary-General of the UN when the Secretary-General came here. Mahinda Rajapaksa undoubtedly knew what he was doing because he himself had gone to Geneva in the late 1980s - in 1988 and 1989 - to seek the intervention of the UN Human Rights body when there were grave violations of human rights and humanitarian laws in the South of this country, when Sinhala civilian youth and Sinhala people were being slaughtered in their thousands, indeed tens of thousands, at that point of time. The only difference is that what happened in 2008-2009 happened in the North. ?
Nobody is complaining on behalf of the armed combatants. Mahinda Rajapaksa did not complain on behalf of armed combatants when he went to Geneva in 1988 and 1989. He only complained about what happened to civilians. The UN Human Rights Council is also dealing with what happened to civilians. In fact, simultaneously investigations have been conducted against the armed combatants about their own violations of human rights laws and humanitarian laws also against civilians. This culture of impunity should not continue. It should come to an end. What happened to unarmed civilians in violation of human rights and humanitarian laws must not be confused with legitimate actions taken by the State against armed combatants carrying on an armed struggle against the State. The distinction between these two situations is clearly defined in humanitarian laws and human rights laws and the standards of judgement pertaining to the applicability of the said two laws are clearly recognized internationally. I found my friends, in the course of the speeches they made earlier the day, referring to war heroes. I do not think all war heroes were engaged in committing violations of international humanitarian laws and human rights laws but some of them undoubtedly committed crimes against both those laws. ?
?
Can the cases pertaining to journalist Lasantha Wickrematunge, cartoonist Prageeth Eknaligoda, five students murdered in Trincomalee when they were standing on the beachfront or the 17 aid workers killed in Muttur be swept under the carpet merely because the persons accused of those crimes are members of the armed forces; so called war heroes? If those crimes cannot be swept under the carpet merely for the reason that those acts were committed by war heroes, how can violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law which are crimes against humanity committed in 2008-2009 be swept under the carpet? This was impunity at?
its zenith. ??
Sir, no one should be allowed to confuse the execution of legitimate duties by a government and the wanton killing of unarmed civilians in furtherance of the political agendas of persons holding high office. Unless this culture is brought to an end, it will continue and that must not?be allowed.
??
What happened in the South from 1988-1989 and in the North from 2008-2009 are crimes against humanity. No country, Sir, can continuously disregard?such crimes. ?
?
As a result of its short-sighted policies and not being inclusive in exercising powers of governance or in sharing sovereignty vested in the people of this country, our country has faced catastrophic situations. We need to retrieve ourselves from this dire situation. ??
Full and expeditious implementation of the UN Human Rights Council Resolution will be the first step in that direction. Engaging in devious tactics to delay or deny the process will - I respectfully submit - be positively harmful to the future of this country. ??

Mihintale, believed to be the site of a meeting between the Buddhist monk Mahinda and King Devanampiyatissa
Poson Poya marks the arrival of Arahat Maha Mahinda Maha Thera in Sri Lanka along with the message of the Sakya clan?s Great Son Gotama Buddha.
?
By admiring with respect and following the Buddha?s impeccable words, Emperor Asoka who governed Maha Bharata -- ancient India, profoundly launched a Dhamma missionary programme in many countries. ?
After the successful accomplishment of by his considerable numbers of enlightened disciples, the Blessed One, the Buddha compassionately advised and guided thus: ?
?Go forth, O Bhikkhus, for the good of the many, for the happiness of the many, out of compassion for the world, for the good, benefit and happiness of divine beings and human beings. Let not two go by one way: Preach, O Bhikkhus, the Dhamma, excellent in the beginning, excellent in the middle, excellent in the end, both in the spirit and in the letter. Proclaim the Holy life, altogether perfect and pure.?
Whether one believes it or not, the Law of Kamma will pave the way to one?s own destination which one designs?by oneself
The Son of Emperor Asoka ? the great disciple of the Fully Enlightened One, Arahant Maha Mahinda Maha Thera was requested by his preceptor the Ven. Moggaliputta Tissa MahaThera to visit Sri Lanka to introduce and establish the incomparable message of the Gotama Buddha.
?
Poson Poya or the Full Moon Day in June is a very significant event for Sri Lankan Buddhists who vibrantly commemorate it with many colourful, spiritual and cultural activities.

Some 2,325 years ago, King Devanampiyatissa was a Head of State. There was a national festival attended by the people and the king at Mihintale which is situated in the vicinity of Anuradhapura.

In the present, all ruins around Mihintale and Anuradhapura witness and testify, how the people of that era were prosperous and united. It was called and named the, ?State of Reservoirs and Island of the Dhamma?
After meeting and listening to Arahant Mahinda Maha Thera, King Devanampiyatissa placed unwavering confidence in the refuge of the Triple Gem. He was a very pious and devout Buddhist leader who governed our country without hatred and prejudice. Not by words and lip service but genuinely by deeds, he helped establish and safeguard the Buddha Sasana in Sri Lanka.
?
Above mentioned facts were very visible and evident in our history, but in the present, most of them have dramatically eroded and turned topsy-turvy because most people have embraced and obsessively follow so called ?Party Politics? which dangerously and atrociously have changed the whole atmosphere in our human society. Human values and value of human life are degraded. Antagonism and animosity are vivaciously and lively visible. The Dhamma State or Dharmarajya has perilously become a state of injustice. The paramount part of the Buddha?s teaching merely has become only a lip service. Corruption and injustice are the driving and governing forces in our society today. However, it is not too late to re-establish the righteous way to lead our society to be united in peace and harmony.
?
Unfortunately those who do not understand the benefit of wholesome kamma and repercussion of unwholesome kamma will never refrain from wrongdoing and immoral activities. ?
When mental impurities such as anger, jealousy, craving and so on are conceived in the mind one can feel and experience dissatisfaction, suffering, misery, pain, and discomfort, etc. When kindness, compassion, generous or pure thoughts are conceived in the mind one can feel, perceive and experience innermost tranquility, calmness, peace, serenity and inner silence.
?
The Dhamma says that if it is to be immediately effective it has to be experienced by the wise by themselves. ?
Whether one believes it or not, the Law of Kamma will pave the way to one?s own destination which one designs by oneself. ?
The Teaching of the Buddha is completely based on the mind. In his first and foremost discourse he clearly and explicitly explains about suffering, cause of suffering, cessation of suffering and the way to cessation of suffering. No one can understand this till one treads this path. Where words are concerned, anyone can endlessly argue with the various information and numerous facts but in reality till one eradicat one?s own defilement he or she won?t be free from suffering. One should be a genuine human being, not in form but with innermost qualities. ?
This is the great message that we received 2,325 years ago and the compassionatel Ven. Maha Mahinda Maha Thera delivered to us. ?
The Ven. Maha Thera introduced the culture of inner peace and remarkably revealed the true danger in the culture of violence. ?
The great Master the Buddha is our impeccable and incomparable role model. As Sri Lankan Buddhists, Arahant Mahinda Maha Thera is our leader. Specially all monks should reflect upon this remarkable character. Unfortunately most so called monks disgracefully involve in party politics.?
Some so called politicians have donated and contributed millions of rupees and other materials, now some monks work for them. Monks are not able to escape from it. They are very partial to donors and create violent atmosphere with their blind followers. ?
Unfortunately in order to preserve and secure their political hidden agendas our politicians have influenced and manipulated Buddhist monks to engage in politics after we won our independence. From the beginning of becoming independent from Great Britain we began to divide and separate. ?
What is the purpose of being a Buddhist monk? What is the prime role and responsibility as a monk? If someone examines though the whole teaching of the Buddha no one can find any advice or word that he has asked monks to engage in party politics. Now they have completely changed the Buddha?s words as they wish. This is the disaster in our country now. ?
The following is how monks should behave if they are to be true disciples of the Buddha: ?
?Good is restraint in the body; good is restraint in speech; good is restraint in thought. Restraint everywhere is good. The monk restrained in every way is freed from all suffering?(The Buddha) 
??He who is friendly amid the hostile, peaceful amid the violent, and unattached amid the attached ? him do I call a holy man.? (The Buddha) ?
One?s own introspection is the profound examination and analysis. If someone honestly examinies ?one?s own inner behaviour can change the manner which mostly disclosed in words and deeds, and walk on the righteous path that leads to true peace and happiness. ?
?Though so called Buddhists observe and promise themselves not to violate the precepts and rules, in front of their own children and parents and along with some parents and children they absurdly and imprudently violate and showing their own disgraceful act, contrary to what they articulate and advise. ?
Now the time has arrived to look inward for every one of their own mentality, thoughts, feelings, how they treat others, what refined language they speak with others, how they address others, how polite you are, do you verbally hurt or physically harm others, are you jealous of others, are you happy about others achievements and accomplishments, are you strong enough to tolerate others mistakes, do you discriminate others, do you tolerate others beliefs, faiths and culture, and so on. ?
?
This is the time for you to take into consideration of your own life. You may be young or healthy and wealthy but unpredictable contingencies and unavoidable circumstances will inform you that your life ends one day at any moment. That will be a crucial moment for anyone who is healthy or wealthy or influential and powerful. That moment should not be on of regret or repentant. To have delightful inner feeling, one definitely must tread on a path which is compassionately elaborated by the great Master the Buddha. ??
You are completely responsible for yourself. One is utterly accountable for oneself. Therefore, one?s every single verbal, mental and physical action should be purely and exclusively virtuous and righteous.
?
Be kind and wise to concentrate on your own duties and responsibilities rather than the Head of State or any other.
??
Reflection must be thoroughly focused on one?s own family. Not materially but emotionally. ?
Then you will be happy to say that I am kind and generous. I am virtuous and righteous. ?
?Watchful of speech, well controlled in mind, one should not commit evil with the body. Let one purify these three courses of action, and win the path made known by the Great sage ? the Blessed One?
??Overcome the angry by non-anger; overcome the wicked by goodness; overcome the miser by generosity; overcome the liar by truth.? ?(The Gotama Buddha) ??

Two children missing after three-wheeler falls into canal
	
Two children went missing, a woman died and another three were injured last night when a three-wheeler fell into the Viyana canal near the 17 miles post on the Mahiyanganaya-Badulla main road, after a head on collision, Police said.
They said, there were two men, two women and two children in the three-wheeler travelling from Mahiyanganaya-Badulla, when the accident happened.
The accident occurred when another three-wheeler coming on the opposite side of the road from Badulla to Mahiyanganaya collided with it.
After the accident the three-wheeler with six persons veered off the road and fell into the Viyana canal and got washed away for about one kilometer.
The two men were admitted to the Meegahakivula hospital and two women were later transferred to the Badulla hospital under critical condition but the two children had gone missing in the canal. A 21-year-old woman who was a resident of Meegahakiula died during the admission to the hospital.
The two missing children were identified as 7-year-old Kavishka Gayan (Boy) and 2-year-old Rashmi Dipthika (Girl).
The driver of the other three-wheeler was taken to police custody and divers are searching for the missing children. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Unravelling the mystery shrouding the magical number
	
?
In my last article (that appeared on the Jyotisha page on May 26) I cited personalities, even Government authorities in USA, who had - based on their great discomfort due to being associated with the Number of the Beast -666- replaced it with another number considered favourable. Even former US President Ronald Reagan had reacted with horror towards Number 666 of his new residential address and changed it to another number before going into its occupation.
?
And if you carry a symbol representing the Satanic number with you, day in and day out, would it produce some specific effect on you?
Now the question arises as to what makes the big businesses worldwide take the exact opposite attitude towards the magical number 666? ?Why do they willingly and purposefully associate themselves with the number of the beast, by displaying it on their bodies or incorporating it into their business logos? Does it make a difference to a person wearing a T-shirt with the Satanic number, or having a 666 tattooed permanently on his body? What might be the advantage of being associated with the 666?
Could a bottle containing an energy drink displaying the number of the beast have some specific effect on a human who consumes this drink? If the answer is in the negative, then the question: WHY are they using the magic number? Remains unanswered.?
And if you carry a symbol representing the Satanic number with you, day in and day out, would it produce some specific effect on you?
?
Nexus between the apple and Satan
Most of us are familiar with the Biblical story of Adam and Eve, where Eve is ?misled? by a serpent into eating the apple from the forbidden tree of knowledge in the middle of the Garden of Eden. As we can read in the Bible in Genesis 3, the serpent told Eve: ?God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil?. After Eve saw that ?the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom? she took some and ate them. When God found out that Adam and Eve had disobeyed him, he condemned them and banished them from the Garden of Eden.
Why did Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak choose for their company the name ?Apple? and the very same symbol of the apple which led Adam and Eve to being banished from the Garden of Eden?
?
?
Apple?s first logo
As you can see above, Apple Computer?s first logo depicted Isaac Newton sitting below an apple tree, with the legend that read ?Newton ? A mind forever voyaging through strange seas of thought ? Alone.? The link between the name and logo of the company and Newton?s apple tree is very clear here.
?
?
?
?
?
?
Isaac Newton and the apple?
While Newton was mostly known as a rational and scientific person, some of his private writings that were uncovered recently show a completely different side of his personality. It appears that Newton was obsessed with the occult. In fact, Newton wrote much more about the occult than on his scientific theory, but kept most of that work private, say some numerologists. While being seen as a scientist, he pursued activities that would be labelled as pseudoscience by the scientific community.?
According to some occult scientists Newton?s secret writings remained locked away for two centuries because they were considered very ?dangerous?. Newton kept them secretly well-guarded in his possession probably because he knew that he would be accused of heresy or blasphemy and end up in prison like Galileo Galilei if he had published them,?
?And more interesting and intriguing is the fact that the first Apple computer was sold for $666.66!
?
?
Just a Coincidence?
?
Are the shapes of these logos and the use of the Satanic number 666 just coincidences? The corporation referred to above, and others who have adopted equally intriguing marks and logos, would almost certainly deny that their logos are either pagan, occultic, or New Age. It may be that the corporate leadership is, in fact, innocently unaware of the esoteric, sometimes hidden meanings of these symbols. Moreover, it must be admitted that a given symbol can have a multiplicity of meanings. Therefore, none can make accusations against these companies and their products, say the numerologists.
Nevertheless, scholars considered proficient in occult sciences maintain that Satan, the temporal ?god of this world? (II Corinthians 4:4), could be expected to plant his symbols of evil throughout the globe ?in its last days?. Satan is looked on as the father of liars, the blasphemous one, the dragon and serpent. Some scholars are convinced that Satan and his agents are very busy these days, conditioning men?s minds and programming their senses with stunningly effective visual magic and sorcery.

Britons vote in key election
	
?
Britain went to the polls on Thursday for a snap election called by Prime Minister Theresa May ahead of Brexit after a campaign shadowed?by terrorism. ??
May called the vote in April, when opinion poll ratings for her and her centre-right Conservative Party were sky high, presenting herself as the strong leader to take Britain into Brexit talks. ??
But Islamist attacks in London and Manchester have put her under pressure over her six years as interior minister, while campaign missteps have dented her reputation as a safe pair?
of hands. ??
Meanwhile opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, an anti-war campaigner deemed unelectable by a majority of his own lawmakers, has run an energetic campaign, promising change and an end to austerity. ? While May has been touring target seats around the country, delivering slogan-heavy speeches to small groups of hand-picked activists, Corbyn has drawn large crowds to open-air rallies. ??
Corbyn, a 68-year-old leftwinger who has never held ministerial office and defied the odds to win the Labour leadership two years ago, urged supporters in Glasgow to think big. ??
??Wouldn?t it be great if on Friday we woke up to... a Labour government that will be a government for all of our communities across the whole of the country,? he said. ?Speaking to reporters on her plane during a final burst of campaigning on Wednesday, May insisted she had no regrets about calling the vote three years early. ??

Comey slams White House ?lies? in blockbuster testimony
	
?
Ousted FBI chief James Comey accused the White House of lies and defamation Thursday, in explosive testimony that painted Donald Trump as dishonest and operating far outside presidential norms. ?
During almost three hours of blockbuster sworn testimony to a Senate panel, Comey described himself as ?stunned? by Trump?s ?very disturbing? and ?very concerning? behaviour during several private meetings. ?
Expanding on the bombshell statement released on the eve of his appearance, Comey said the president asked him for ?loyalty? during a White House dinner and to lay off former national security advisor Mike Flynn --who is under criminal investigation-- imploring Comey to ?let this go.??
??It?s my judgment that I was fired because of the Russia investigation,? he told senators. ?I was fired in some way to change, or the endeavour was to change the way the Russia investigation was being conducted. That is a very big deal.? Detailing private talks with a sitting president, which under normal circumstances would never see the light of day, Comey said he took painstaking notes of the extraordinary encounters for fear Trump might ?lie? about the meetings. ?
Comey indicated that it was now up to a high-powered special prosecutor to determine whether the president?s behaviour constituted an obstruction of justice, a potentially impeachable offence. ?
Trump avoided directly responding to the explosive accusations, defiantly telling supporters at a religious event in the capital: ?We are going to fight and win.? But the White House hit back angrily at Comey.
