Electoral reforms ready by Apr 22
	
The Cabinet on the proposed electoral reforms will be taken up for discussion by the Ministers at the meeting scheduled for April 22, the first after the April New Year vacation, informed sources said.
The electoral reforms will be evolved for implementation along with the 19th Amendment to the Constitution as an initiative by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).
Already the SLFP has appointed a committee to work out electoral reforms in consultation with the Elections Department. It is learnt that the Government will opt for?? a simple delimitation process to be completed within a month. The geographical expanse and the size of voter population of electorates will be considered in delimitating their boundaries under the proposed system.
Accordingly, the boundaries of electorates with more than 100,000 voters each, or less than 50,000 will be delimitated.
Colombo-Central, Kaduwela and Homagama are three of the electorates identified with more than 100,000 voters each.
The electorates with less than 50,000 voters are slated to be amalgamated under the proposed system. Five such electorates?? have been identified in the Jaffna district alone.
In Colombo, there will be an addition of a few more electorates. Besides, the electorates with a geographical expanse of over 1000 Square Kilometres will be reviewed for delimitation.? The Ampara electorate of the Digamadulla distract, the Tissamaharama electorate of the Hambantota district and the Anuradhapura ?East electorate are the geographically largest constituencies.
Altogether, there are 160 electorates in the country. It is not intended to alter this number by a big margin under the proposed delimitation process. Besides, a few multi-member constituencies will be set up.
?We will not go for major changes. Also, we will ensure representations for minor and minority parties,? a minister said. (Kelum Bandara)?

Minister denies political interference
	
Says Sri Lanka is in the process of amending the Sports Law and Regulations in line with Olympic Charter
Sports Minister Navin Dissanayake has written to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) categorically denying that any pressure was exerted to any sports body or federation by the Sports Ministry as alleged in its letter to him on April 7, 2015.
?We categorically deny that any pressure had been exerted to any sports body or federation by our Ministry,? Minister Dissanayake wrote.
The Minister was responding to a two-page letter sent by IOC which asked Sri Lanka to reverse its decision to hold elections under controversial provisions of the Sports Law in order to ensure autonomy and jurisdiction of national sports associations. Failure to do so would leave Sri Lanka at risk of international status, they warned. ?This letter was followed by another warning from IOC member, FIFA, the world governing body for football.
The letters come in the wake of a Sports Ministry decision to hold elections under controversial provisions of the Sports Law and the subsequent regulations made on January 15, 2013.
In a three-page letter addressed to the IOC and copied to all International Sports Federations and the National Olympic Committee of Sri Lanka (NOC), Minister Dissanayake says he would in no way permit any interference or politicisation of any sports body in Sri Lanka.
?We wish to inform you that we will on our part comply with the roadmap created on these new timelines stated above and assure you that the present government of Sri Lanka and the Ministry will ensure and take every possible step to work very closely with the IOC, ASOIF, ANOC, OCA and all other International Sports Federations and that we will no way permit any interference or politicisation of any sports body in Sri Lanka,? the Minister?s reply on April 10, 2015, stated.
Explaining the circumstances that led to the implementation of the Sports Law and the subsequent regulations to conduct the election of office bearers, Minister Dissanayake says a joint committee appointed to amend the Sports Law and the Regulations to fall in line with the guidelines of the IOC, international bodies has made significant progress.?
?This process would take a minimum of the months, till June 30, according to the Committee. Thereafter, the draft has to be sent to the Attorney General and the Legal Draftsman?s Department prior to being placed for debate and approval in parliament. This process would also take a minimum of 4 to 6 months. Further, Sri Lanka will hold a General Election to elect new members of Parliament by end of June or July and expediting the process of passing the new Sports Law seems impossible due to all these factors,? the minister wrote.(Champika Fernando)
