BCCI bans wives, girlfriends during SL tour: Report
	
	Team India players reportedly have been informed that their wives and girlfriends will not be allowed during their official tour to Sri Lanka.
	Indian media reports claimed that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) this time prohibited wives and girlfriends from accompanying Indian cricketers.
	Team India is scheduled to play three Tests starting in Galle on Aug 12. The team-led by Captain Virat Kohli will reach Colombo on Aug 3.
	Indian Express quoted a BCCI official as saying, "Most of the players on tour are just coming off a month-long break where they had enough time to spend with their families. And we've decided that their wives will not be allowed on tour."
	According to sources, after Bangladesh tour fiasco, BCCI does not want to take any risk and wants cricketers to concentrate on their matches. However, this would not be the first time when BCCI would ban wives and girlfriends of cricketers to accompany them during official tour.
	The Indian Board earlier too had issued notice prohibiting partners on tours. This time board members claimed that previous policy should be implemented again as the players have spent considerable time home.

Ms. Kumaratunga has always sided with good people. She played the key role in electing President Maitripala Sirisena to office.

Five held for kidney change in Sri Lanka
	
	The Indian Special Task Force of the Crime Branch on Friday arrested five persons of a family from Berhampur, Odisha, including a woman, in connection with an illegal kidney transplantation carried out at a hospital in Colombo recently.
	Crime Branch sources said the family lured a 20-year-old youth, Kanhu Behera of Phulbani, to sell his kidney for Rs 3.5 lakh to one of their family members. The Crime Branch action followed a complaint lodged by sub-collector (Phulbani) Balaram Mallik on July 13. The sub-collector received complaints from local sources and lodged a complaint with the Crime Branch, The Times of India reported.
	ADG (Crime Branch) B K Sharma said Kanhu's kidney was transplanted onto Mahendra Pattnaik, one of the accused.
	Pattnaik's relatives Trinath Pattnaik and Kiran Pattnaik lured Kanhu to sell his kidney to the former. The kidney recipient's wife, Sulata, and elder brother Rajendra also abetted the illegal sale and transplantation, said Sharma.
	"The accused also prepared fake certificates and showed that Kanhu is an adopted son of Pattnaik's mother. They also furnished the fake documents and managed to get a passport for Kanhu," said Sharma.
	"They chose to conduct the kidney transplantation outside India in view of stringent laws of human organ transplantation in the country. They tried in some hospitals in India, but were denied. The accused decided to do the transplantation in Sri Lanka," said Sharma.
	Asked about the laws in Sri Lanka, Sharma said the matter is being investigated. "We do not know why the accused chose Colombo for the kidney transplant. So far, we have not examined anybody in Colombo. We will do it soon," said Sharma. Soon after the arrest, the police granted bails to Pattnaik and his wife Sulata on health grounds. Crime Branch said it would turn the heat on those government officers, who helped the accused prepare fake documents.
	The incident came close on heels of two kidney scandals, reported in Cuttack last year. While police arrested several persons, the enforcement directorate (ED) is looking into the money trail of the scams.

Old habits die hard: JVP
	
Friday's shooting at Bloemendhal Road where a United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG) supporter was killed is ample evidence that some politicians are not prepared to mend their old habits of associating with underworld gangsters though they talk of social ills, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said.
General Secretary Tilvin Silva said this was an obvious conclusion one could draw going by the reports that the killing was linked to underworld warfare.
Some parties talk of democracy and tell the people not to vote for those who are corrupt and those who associate with the underworld while all the time associating with the underworld gangsters, he said. (Yohan Perera)

Prabhakarans bodyguard in lankan election fray
	
Sivanathan Navindra alias Venthan, a former bodyguard of the slain Tamil Tiger leader Velupillai Prabhakaran is among nine ex-Tiger militants contesting the August 17 Sri Lankan parliamentary elections from the Jaffna-Kilinochchi electoral district as members of a new outfit, Crusaders for Democracy (CFD).
Venthan and fellow candidate, Rasaiah Tharmakulasingham alias Gamini, had both lost their legs in the war. And like others in the CFD list, had undergone rehabilitation conducted by the Lankan armed forces after Eelam War IV. The Puli Muga Silanthi, a poisonous spider, is their election symbol.
Other CFD candidates are Kalikutti Subramanian alias Charles of the Artillery section; Kumaravelu Akilan alias Iyal, a computer operator; Thangarasa Thevathasan alias Gangai Athman who worked with Intelligence Chief Pottu Amman; Vinayagasundaram Mohanasundaram alias Gangai Alagan; Veeran Shakthivel ailas Thani Arasan; Sivaguru Murugadas alias Raviraj; and Nadesapillai Vithyatharan, a non-LTTE cadre who is described as a Oodaga Porali (Media Warrior). Vithyatharan, who was editor of the popular Tamil daily Uthayan, is also Coordinator of the CFD.
Vithyatharan told Express that if only the CFD had funds, it would be able to grab three of the seven seats up for grabs.
 Reception from the people is encouraging. People feed the campaigners, thus enabling them to save on food expenditure, he said.
The ex-cadres are restoring faith among those who had lost faith in the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) after its defeat in 2009, Vithyatharan claimed.
When a lame ex-bodyguard of Prabhakaran was asked if the CFD could be depended upon to deliver, he shot back saying that it was because of people like him that Prabhakaran was able to sleep soundly at night, he said.
On the CFDs manifesto, Vithyatharan said that it wants all international agreements on the Tamil question to be implemented and to press this, it will fight using moral force which he described as  Gandhian in an extreme form. 
As examples of such a struggle he cited the fast-unto-death of Thyagi Thileepan of Jaffna and Annai Poopathi of Batticaloa against the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) in the late 1980s. (Indian Express)

He pledged to look into the cases of missing persons and to give redress to their families.
He said his party would get a majority in eight provinces, but that he needed representation from the Vanni as well.
He also promised to modernise the North by setting up two super investment zones -- in Vavuniya and Kilinochchi. He also pledged to set up an information technology zone in Jaffna. He said these projects would generate employment in the north
He said the UNFGG, if elected, would not forget the traditional agricultural sector of the North and would begin work on the Bogaswewa, Weli Oya, Paranngi Aru and Mahakambili irrigation projects.
He said all members of the Civil Defence Force would be made permanent.

Ravi trying to create terror- Thilanga
	
	UPFA candidate Thilanga Sumathipala charged that Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake was trying to create terror in the streets of Colombo.
	Speaking of the Bloemandhal shooting incident where Karunanayakes supporters were shot at, Sumathipala alleged the incident was a repercussion of the UNP candidates political activities. 
	Sumathipala also alleged that Karunanyake had exerted his influence to release the 21 individuals who had been arrested for the incident. According to election laws parties cannot organize election rallies and motorcades after handing in nominations. However, the finance minister flouted this law, he said. 
	The former parliamentarian said the underworld had been eradicated by the previous regime. The activities of the UNP candidates are reducing the chance for a free and fair election and also ensuring the rise of the underworld, Sumathipala said.
	 
	The Police Chief and the Elections Commissioner should intervene to ensure a free and fair election, he said.

TNA fueling hardliners with demand for federalism - JVP
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today hit hard at the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) which had demanded for federalism and said this demand was revived at every election thus fueling Sinhala hardliners and resulting in unwanted ethnic tension.
TNA talks of federalism because they dont have anything to offer the people in the North and East for whom it had done little or nothing through the Northern Provincial Council, JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva
	General Secretary Tilvin Silva
	General Secretary Tilvin Silva
told a news briefing.
Mr. Silva said the need of the hour was to ensure equality and social justice to all people whatever their caste, creed or community might be.
He accused the United National Party (UNP) and the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) for trying to hoodwink the public servants.
He said the UPFA campaign led by its Kurunegala district candidate Mahinda Rajapaksa has promised a bonanza to public servants which he failed to provide during his two terms as president.
Mr. Silva said the UNFGG led by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is also giving promises after undermining the public service by offering voluntary retirement schemes for them in 2002.
He said its doubtful whether the UNFGG will do the same this time as well with the recent statement made by the premier that public servants would be given five years of unpaid leave to start up their own ventures or to find employment abroad.
Mr. Silva assured public sector employees that the JVP would fight for their rights if the JVP was able to garner a sufficient number of seats. (Yohan Perera)
