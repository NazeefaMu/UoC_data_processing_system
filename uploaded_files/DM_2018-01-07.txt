President halts recovery of Samurdhi loans given during former rule
	
President Maithripala Sirisena had ordered the Department of Samurdhi Development to halt the recovery of loans issued for housing renovation of low income families by the Samurdhi Banks during the previous government.
These loans have been sanctioned by the then 'Divineguma' department for Samurdhi beneficiaries.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Samurdhi Development Department Director General Dr. S.J.Nawarathna said the President had instructed him to stop deduction of loan premium from the monthly Samurdhi allowance .
Under the theme of a prosperous home Rs. 2,500 were given for each house which required further repairs of Samurdhi entitled, low-income families.
It was expected to provide an allocation subject to a maximum of Rs. 10,000/= in four stages for the repair (supply of roofing sheets/construction of roof/construction of walls/plastering, preparation of work site etc) of the houses of low income earners. However, only the first phase had been released.
The Department recently decided to recover the money, issued in the form of loans, by deducting it from Samurdhi allowances.
A total of Rs 3 billion had given to Divineguma beneficiaries according to the programme. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Schoolchildren trapped in Piliyandala drug racket
	
A well- organised drug racket which has continued for several months targeting schoolchildren in the Piliyandala area has been revealed to the Daily Mirror.
It was revealed the drug menace had completely affected the Batakaththara, Madapatha, L. S.Watte, Kahapola and Makandana areas and is popular among the schoolchildren as Paspanguwa due to its distribution in five ways.
Among the drugs found were toxic arecanut (Mawa), tablets, Kerala Cannabis, toxic powder and toxic drinks.
When the Daily Mirror inquired into the matter it was revealed that drug peddling in the entire area had been conducted under the protection of some local politicians.
The drug peddlers are reportedly using a new technique to addict school children into the drugs by introducing the toxic areca nut and toxic drinks from the ages of 10 to 14 for a lesser price.
The toxic powder, Kerala Ganja and tablets are given upper classes students including advanced level students in the area.
Also it had been reveled that the students were attracted to these drugs in Internet Cafes in the area, near Sunday Schools and the schools.
When contacted, some residents who wanted to remain anonymous due to threats by drug peddlers said one third of the school children had already addicted and some of them had abandoned school and selling the drugs due to the benefits received by the drug peddlers. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
