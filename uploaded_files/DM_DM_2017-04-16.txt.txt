Attidiya birds fly away
	
The large scale sewerage dumping in the Attidiya canal along the Lake road during the past two weeks, polluting the Attidiya Lake, has resulted in the disappearance of many bird species from the area, residents complained.
Attidiya wetlands were declared a bird Sanctuary in 1990.
The unbearable stench in the highly residential area is posing a major health hazard too, the residents point out.
No action has been taken by the authorities regarding the matter so far.

Belgian Tobacco Company to move operations from Ireland to SL
	
A cigar-manufacturing plant in Co Roscommon, Ireland will close in May and move its operations to Sri Lanka with a loss of 38 jobs for the town of Ballaghaderreen in Co Roscommon, The Irish Times reported on Friday.
It was reported that the company is moving its operations to an existing plant in Sri Lanka in order to rationalise the business and save on wage costs.
Exclusive Cigar Manufacturers Ireland (ECMI) opened in 1978 under the name Villager and has been a large local employer since.
The business was sold to a large Belgian tobacco company called J Corts in January of this year.
A statement on the J Corts website published on January 18th says: ECMI has shown considerable volume growth and will benefit from the expertise and size of J. Corts.
However, in a press release issued on Thursday, the company said it was beginning a consultation process with employee representatives before issuing redundancy notifications on May 15.
The purpose of the consultation process is to explore any alternatives to the proposed closure of the factory potentially resulting in a redundancy of all 38 employees of ECMI Ltd, the statement said.

Indian metro probes porn screened at busy station
	
Hardcore pornography that flashed onto a giant screen at one of Delhi's busiest metro stations has prompted red-faced rail authorities to launch an investigation, an official said Sunday, after footage of the incident was shared widely online.
Commuters were stopped in their tracks at the station in the Indian capital's central business district of Connaught Place last weekend when the x-rated footage began playing on a large screen that normally broadcasts advertisements for luxury property or credit card schemes.
Scores of people captured the moment on their mobile phones and the images have since gone viral on social media.
Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) spokesman Mohinder Yadav told AFP Sunday that authorities were trying to identify three suspects believed to be behind the incident last Sunday.
DMRC said the offending screen was operated by a private company and had an unsecure WiFi network, leaving it accessible to others.
As per CCTV footage, three men have run (the) porn clip through their mobile on this TV, the DMRC said in a statement late Saturday, adding that the contractor in charge of the screen would be required to have password protection from now on.
The incident made headlines in a country where talk about sex or even public displays of affection are seen by many as taboo.
Mainstream cinema is stripped of raunchiness by India's socially-conservative censor board, which muted the word lesbian from a Hindi-language film, blocked the release of a toned-down version of the erotic movie Fifty Shades of Grey in 2015, and deemed two James Bond kissing scenes unsuitable for an Indian audience.
