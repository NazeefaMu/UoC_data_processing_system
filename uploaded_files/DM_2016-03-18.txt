It was Malinga who opted to return: SLC
	
Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) Secretary Mohan De Silva said it was Malinga who wanted to return to the country saying he was not 100 percent fit.
He said the team management had noticed Malingas poor physical fitness during yesterdays training session.
Mr. De Silva said Malinga had returned to the country and that a suitable replacement would be sent soon.
He rejected the statement made by Malinga that he was sent to India despite his recent recovery for a knee journey.
His allegation is absolutely false. He sent us a mail saying he was stepping down from the captaincy due to his knee injury and but would be playing in the tournament if he is selected. He informed us that even though he was unable to go to India on March 8 with the other team members, he will go on March 15 after the treatment for the injury is completed. We did not send him without his consent, De Silva said. (Piyumi Fonseka)

N. Koreans detained in SL after carrying cash
	
India-based North Korean embassy requested for the release of the two North Koreans who were arrested on Monday in a Colombo-based airport while transferring to another flight carrying US$150,000 in cash.
According to the sources, two North Koreans, who departed from Oman to China, were arrested on Monday in a Colombo-based airport while transferring to another flight. Under Sri Lankan law, any cash amounting to more than $10,000 can be confiscated if the carriers fail to make a proper report to the authorities.
The sources, however, said the Sri Lankan authorities are still mulling over the punishment as the two North Koreans were only transferring flights.
The detained North Koreans said the cash were the wages earned by themselves as well as other co-workers at construction sites in Oman.
Policy watchers said the North Koreans carried the cash in an apparent bid to evade surveillance amid the rising sanctions against Pyongyang.
North Korea conducted what it claimed to be a successful test of an H-bomb on Jan. 6. Earlier in February, the North also launched a rocket carrying the Kwangmyongsong-4 satellite, which was viewed by many as a cover for testing its intercontinental ballistic missile technology. Such provocations resulted in tougher sanctions by the global community.
Policy watchers estimated there are some 50,000 to 60,000 North Korean workers in around 50 countries including China and Russia dispatched to earn foreign currency for Pyongyang. (yonhapnews)

Similarity between two transformer explosions: Ministry
	
The Power and Renewable Energy Ministry said there appeared to be a similarity between the two unusual explosions that broke out at the Biyagama Grid Sub Station last week and the Kotugoda CEB Grid Sub Station today.
Ministry Secretary Suren Batagoda said the cause of the two explosions still remained a question for the engineers.
He said suspicions have also arisen as to how the two transformers had exploded in the same way amidst the security within Sub Stations in Biyagama and Kotugoda.
It is still a question even for our senior engineers who have been in the field for more than 50 years, as to what caused the explosions. They told us that such explosions in transformers have not been recorded anywhere in the world, he said.
However, repair work of the transformer which caught fire today is still undergoing and therefore some areas in Negombo covered by the particular transformer had reported a power failure. (Piyumi Fonseka)

SL doctor appeals conviction to avoid being deported
	
A Sri Lankan doctor in Australia, who was found guilty of the manslaughter of her abusive husband, has lodged an appeal against her conviction, the West Australian reported.
On February 22, Dr. Chamari Liyanage was acquitted of murdering her doctor husband Dinendra Athukorala in Geraldton in June 2014 while he slept, but was found guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter.
Supreme Court Justice Stephen Hall sentenced Liyanage to four years jail and made her eligible for parole. With time already served, she could be released from prison in June.
Since the 36-year-old is not an Australian citizen, she is facing deportation at the end of her sentence.
The appeal was lodged on Monday, but Liyanage's lawyer George Giudice said it wouldnt be heard for months, as the defence and prosecution still needed to make submissions for the appeal.
He said the appeal would oppose his clients conviction, and if she was acquitted, she would be unlikely to face deportation.
I cant see any reason they would have to deport her if she was acquitted and if they did we would certainly be opposing it, he said.
Liyanage gained public sympathy as the sordid details of her husbands abuse were revealed during the trial in Geraldton.
A petition started by a former workmate of Liyanages is being circulated calling on Minister for Immigration and Border Protection Peter Dutton to allow her to remain in Australia when she is released from jail.
A spokesperson for the Department Immigration and Border Protection said the department was aware of the case, but was not able to discuss specific details.
We can confirm that the Australian Government takes very seriously its responsibility to protect the Australian community from the risk of harm posed by non-citizens who engage in criminal conduct or behaviour of concern. Each case will be assessed on its individual merits, the spokesperson said.

Trespass: Male students invited to girls' school-Principal
	
After the Kollupitiya Police informed Court that the complainant -- in a case involving 14 students of a leading boys school in Colombo who were charged with trespass on the property of a girls school in Kollupitiya -- had intimated that she did not wish to proceed with the case, Colombo Fort magistrate and additional district judge Priyantha Liyanage discharged the concerned students.
When the case was taken up in court, SI Dammika Perera of the Kollupitiya Police submitted that the woman principal of the girls school had made a statement to the police saying that the suspect students were invited by her to the girls school. The police also informed Court that they did not wish to proceed with the case.
The attorneys who represented the parents of the suspect students submitted to Court that the students were unaware that it was an offence to congregate near a girls school, and that the parents and the students had been advised not to repeat such actions. (Sumiththa Jayawickrama)
