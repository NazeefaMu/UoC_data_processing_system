A celebrated lawyer  who readily dispensed his knowledge
	
The 20th Death Anniversary of S.D.Percy Valentine, President?s Counsel, falls on 08th October.??
Valentine hailed from a distinguished family and was the eldest son of late S.D.R. Valentine (Proctor) and of late Flora Valentine of Weligampitiya, Ja-Ela. He had his education at De Mazenod College, Kandana, a well known Catholic Private School managed by the Christian Brothers.? ?
Thereafter, he entered the Faculty of Law of the University of Ceylon and obtained his degree. Having passed out as an Advocate in 1961, he served his apprenticeship period in the Chambers of the late A.H.C.De Silva, a Queen?s Counsel.?
?
Although Criminal Law was his forte, he also practiced in the other fields such as Civil and Industrial Law, in the Original and the Appellate Courts. His mastery of facts of a case, his fluency and felicity of diction and his skillful cross-examination made him a much sought after lawyer in most parts of the country. In recognition of his professional eminence, he was appointed a President?s Counsel in 1991. Valentine always maintained the highest traditions of the Bar. Judges and members of the profession always had the highest respect and regard for him.??
I had the rare privilege of serving my period of apprenticeship under him and subsequently served as a junior. He was my guru and was a great source of inspiration to me. I am ever grateful to him for the knowledge, experience, guidance and the training I received whilst working under him.??
There are a large number of lawyers who have served their period of apprenticeship under Valentine. The present Chief Justice His Lordship Priyasath Dep P.C. also served as an apprentice and junior under him.?
?
His interest wasn?t confined to the practice of law. He was once a Vice President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka and a member of the Bar Council for many years. He was also a member of the Professional Purposes Committee of the BASL. He took a great interest in the Continuing Legal Education Programme of the BASL. He was a past President of the Medico-Legal Society of Negombo and also the Lions Club of Kandana Ja-Ela. He was also closely associated with the activities of his school.??
Valentine was a devout catholic and organized the traditional Red Mass for Catholic lawyers for several years. He was essentially a family man and was a loving husband to his wife Sita and a devoted father to his two sons Varuna and Indrajith. He lived to see both his sons enter the legal profession, which was a sense of great joy and satisfaction to him.??
Valentine was a great host. He took pleasure in entertaining his friends and family members at his home.??
It is said that greatness is never measured by birth, wealth or fame, nor by the worth of one?s material possessions, but those in whose hearts you live. Valentine was a good example of this.??
May his soul rest in peace.??

A scholar  who had time for travelling, writing and charity
	
The first Lady Commissioner General of the Inland Revenue Department of Sri Lanka Nirmala Devi Ramachandran is no more. This is because the sprightly 81-year-old was summoned before the creator of the universe. The news of her demise came as a surprise. Her family members had a private funeral for her where her remains were cremated. The funeral was attended by friends and relations. The late Nirmala was born and bred in the salubrious environs of Ward Place. She was born on the 23rd of November in 1935 and passed away on 21st of September in 2017. She was the only girl in a family of four. Her father, the late Dr. Vairamutthu Kathirgamatamby, died 70 years before she was called to rest. Without a father?s love and care she grew up afterwards. The values of honesty, Justice and fair-play were inculcated in her mother (Chellam) and Alma Mater (Ladies College).?
These values helped her undertake any challenging task, even if it came in the world stage. She had her primary and secondary education at Ladies College Colombo. She later read for a degree in Physical Science (London University) from Aquinas College, a private institution and secured a Hons Class.? That paved the way for her to join the Prestigious Inland Revenue fraternity. In 1960, Dr. Surendra married Nirmala Devi. Dr. Surendra and Nirmala acted as the wind under the wings of others and soared to great heights despite envious stings. Her husband was bestowed with the much coveted Deshamanya National Award. Nirmala became the First Lady Commissioner General in the Inland Revenue Department. During her period as Commissioner General the collection at the department soared. The Collection for the period 94 -95 was 20% of G.D.P. This percentage was the highest recorded during the last one and a half decades of the 20th century. Nimala was a voracious reader and a great traveller. The latter could be the reason for her to often put pen and paper together. She published 3 volumes of Hindu Heritage to enrich Hindu culture. She assigned the royalty of the book to the Treasury of the Ramakrishna Mission Trust Fund. This was for the purpose of charity and to alleviate poverty. Friends and relations know of Nirmala?s favourite quote culled from the verse ?Farewell my Friend? by Ravindranath Tagore. It was ?Farewell, farewell My friends I smile and bid you Goodbye. No, shed no tears for I need them not. All I need is your smile?.
?It is difficult to say goodbye with a smile dear friend because your life on earth has come to an end. But Sudarshan, Sanju, Shanath, Pravinath, Harishnath and those near and dear to you will you miss, while you enjoy eternal bliss.??

Govt. may  lose referendum on new Constitution
	
Possibility of a drastically-altered final?report
Strategists count ethno-religious factors in referendum-voting estimates
Overwhelming support of minorities might augment shortfall in Sinhala-Buddhist votes
Making political calculations on the basis of 2015 could prove dangerously-wrong in 2017 and years to follow
?
?
By?D.B.S. Jeyaraj
The coalition government of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has - as one of its primary objectives - the political project of enacting and passing a new Constitution. This requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament and endorsement by the people in an islandwide referendum.?
?
More importantly, the government has been trying to justify its move to introduce a new Constitution saying the envisaged Constitution would be sanctioned by the people. While the government appears to be optimistic about garnering the necessary parliamentary majority and obtaining the people?s approval at a referendum, current political trends as well as ground realities suggest holding a referendum in the current context may very well backfire on the government.
The Constitutional Assembly Steering Committee chaired by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe released its Interim Report on Proposals to be considered in the envisaged Constitution. The report was presented to the Parliament/Constitutional Assembly by the Premier on September 21. The parliamentary debate on the Interim Report will be held for three days on October 30, 31 and November 1 respectively. Thereafter, if everything goes according to schedule, the final report would be compiled and completed by year end and placed before the Parliament/Constitutional Assembly in January 2018. But then as observed by Robert Burns, in life, ?the best laid plans of men and mice often go awry.??
It is understood clearly that the Interim Report, though referred to as a consensual document, is not so in reality. The differing viewpoints expressed by the parties concerned in the annexures, euphemistically-described as observations and principles, make it crystal clear that there is a serious divide among the would-be Constitution-makers. Thus the ongoing Constitutional conversation could breakdown or suffer serious setbacks as discussions progress towards the final report. There is also the chance of a drastically-altered final report as a result of compromises and adjustments to bring about consensus.?
Whatever may or may not be its transformed version, the Steering Committee?s final report of draft Constitutional Proposals is expected to be submitted for the consideration of the Constitutional Assembly early next year. If the proposals were accepted and approved by the Constitutional Assembly, it would be submitted to the Cabinet. The Cabinet will then approve it with or without changes and present the Constitutional provisions to Parliament as a Bill to get passed by a two-thirds majority. The Constitutional Assembly would stand dissolved. If passed by Parliament with a two-thirds majority, the approval and sanction of the people would be obtained by way of an islandwide referendum. Winning the referendum on the Constitution therefore is of crucial importance for this government legally, politically and above all, morally.?
It is in this context that the question of the government winning the Constitutional referendum arises. Of course the draft Constitution or final report is not ready yet. The result of the referendum would very much depend upon the contents of or the substance of the envisaged Constitution. The fate of the referendum would also be determined by the relative strengths and merits of the respective for and against campaigns. The opposition to the new Constitution right now relies more on imagined or speculative complaints than on tangible evidence. It is only when the final version materialises that the opposition can train its guns more effectively on it. The final version would also facilitate the government campaign to market the new Constitution.?
?
Buoyant optimism
Notwithstanding these realities, it is obvious that the dominant line of thought within the government and its allies at the present juncture is one of buoyant optimism that the referendum could and can be won. It is most unlikely that the government would have embarked upon the Constitution project and proceeded so far without some degree of confidence that the referendum battle can be fought and won. Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) leader and National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages Minister Mano Ganesan summed up the government?s position aptly when he observed that winning the referendum would be difficult but it had to be won and so it would be.?
?
It would be foolish on the part of the government and even the respective leaders of ethnic-oriented parties to take the minority voters for granted. The hiatus between pledge and performance by the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe duo and the so-called ?Good Governance? government headed by them is so vast that there is a rising groundswell of resentment against the ruling regime
?
The government?s greatest source of confidence in winning a referendum would naturally be its reliance on the strength of numbers. Numerical strength in this instance would mean the number of votes. At the January 2015 Presidential election, Maithripala Sirisena secured 6,217,1625 votes and skunked Mahinda Rajapaksa who obtained 5,768,09047. In the parliamentary elections of August 2015, the United National Party (UNP) led United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG) polled 5,098,916 votes. The opposition United People?s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) garnered 4,732,664. A significant number of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) MPs elected on the UPFA ticket in 2015 crossed over and currently are part and parcel of the ruling regime. The Sirisena-Wickremesinghe Government is today called a UNP- SLFP coalition government.?
Government strategists opine that the electoral results of 2015 would be repeated in a referendum too. Political support demonstrated by the UNP at the 2015 polls along with the fresh support brought in by the pro-Sirisena SLFP MPs is calculated to be greater than the prevailing strength of the pro-Rajapaksa joint opposition. It is surmised that the UNP-SLFP strength in Parliament would be reflected at the referendum. In addition, the government has the support of two key allies. The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) polled 515,963 and 543,944 votes respectively at the 2015 hustings. Besides, parties like the Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC) and Eelam People?s Democratic Party (EPDP) are also expected to support the new Constitution. Sheer arithmetic therefore makes the government hopeful of winning the referendum.?
?
Already, several Provincial Councillors in the East and North-Central provinces have deserted Maithripala and crossed over to Mahinda. President Sirisena may have given them posts and perks, but it is to the Mahinda Rajapaksa star to which they must hitch their political wagons to gain electoral victory
?
If politics could always be determined by arithmetic alone, the expectations of the government may succeed. But then politics is not a numbers game always. As Leon Trotsky observed, ?Politics is more like algebra than like elementary arithmetic, and still more like higher rather than elementary mathematics? (Oft quoted by Dayan Jayatilleka in his writings). In this instance too, an assumption that arithmetic or numbers based on the votes polled in 2015 alone would deliver the goods at the referendum could be proved wrong.?
Greek Philosopher Heraclitus stated, ?No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it?s not the same river and he?s not the same man.? If I may adapt and adopt it to present circumstances, the electoral rivers of 2015 do not flow now in Sri? Lanka. Likewise, the political strengths of the different political parties in 2015 are not the same now. The electorate has changed. The electoral mood has changed. The perceptions and political views of the voting public have changed. The stock of political parties has risen in some cases and fallen in other. Making political calculations on the basis of 2015 could prove dangerously-wrong in 2017 and years to follow.?
?
Voting? pattern
In the first place, people voted for political parties and individual candidates at elections. There were a number of issues, options and preferences involved. This is not so in a referendum which is conducted to determine a single idea or decide upon a single case.?
In this instance, the referendum would be on whether to accept or reject the new Constitution. While a large number of voters may let party or personal loyalties influence their voting at the referendum, an equally-large number of voters could also treat the matter on its own merits and cast their vote for or against. If that happens, a large number of people would cut across traditional party lines and vote. This would render calculations based on the 2015 polls irrelevant in assessing the referendum voting pattern. The possibility of some government constituents like the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) going against the new Constitution cannot be ruled out.?
Government political strategists also take ethno-religious factors into account in referendum-voting estimates.?
It is widely-acknowledged that Mahinda Rajapaksa remains the single most popular mass figure among Sinhala Buddhist voters. Already, several Provincial Councillors in the East and North-Central provinces have deserted Maithripala and crossed over to Mahinda. President Sirisena may have given them posts and perks, but it is to the Mahinda Rajapaksa star to which they must hitch their political wagons to gain electoral victory.?
In the current political environment, it is expected that Mahinda would spearhead the opposition campaign against the new Constitution at the referendum. In that situation, a larger percentage of Sinhala votes may be polled against the new Constitution. If that happens, the government could lose the referendum as the Sinhalese are the numerically-large ethnicity in the island.??
Government strategists hope to counter that possibility by relying on the minority vote. It is expected that the Sri Lankan Tamils, Muslims, up-country Tamils of recent Indian origin and Sinhala Christians would vote in large numbers for the Constitution. The overwhelming support of the minorities is expected to augment the shortfall in Sinhala-Buddhist votes. This prognosis is on the basis that there would be a re-play of preponderant minority support shown in 2015 for Sirisena at the presidential poll and for the UNP at the parliamentary elections.?
Once again, this assessment could be erroneous. It would be foolish on the part of the government and even the respective leaders of ethnic-oriented parties to take the minority voters for granted.?
The hiatus between pledge and performance by the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe duo and the so-called ?Good Governance? government headed by them is so vast that there is a rising groundswell of resentment against the ruling regime. This has rubbed off greatly on its constituents within the government and parties supporting it from outside.?
Besides, the minorities are likely to be disappointed if the new Constitution does not accommodate all of their aspirations or redress their grievances; virtually impossible. Even those from the minority ethnicities could vote against the new Constitution or not vote at all.?
The greater portion of minority community voters could vote in favour of the Constitution, but a significantly-large number of minority community voters may boycott polls openly or refrain from voting at the referendum. This would cause a deficit in the number of minority community?
votes expected.?
?
Sinhala Buddhist?
The minority ethnicity votes may influence the people?s verdict one way or another, yet the ultimate factor that would determine the result of a referendum of this nature would be the majority or the Sinhala-Buddhist vote. This is because a referendum on the Constitution is being depicted and portrayed as a ?life or death? situation concerning the future of the predominantly Buddhist Sinhala population. It is being propagated already that the new Constitution would pave the way for division of the country. It is also being said that some powerful Western nations, Non-governmental Organisations and Tiger-ish elements in the diaspora are conspiring to roll back the territorial re-unification achieved by the armed forces and establish Tamil Eelam. Former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa has formed the ?Eliya? (Light) movement with the single point agenda of opposing and/or preventing the new Constitution.?
This columnist does not propose at this juncture to delve in detail into the merits and defects of the propaganda by the Sinhala ?nationalist? lobby that the new Constitution would result in separation and setting up of Tamil Eelam. What is noteworthy is the growing perception or suspicion among many members of the majority community that the new Constitution is indeed a conspiracy to divide the nation and establish Tamil Eelam. This perception, however wrong it may seem, is the prevailing reality.?
Such a perception can only be challenged and changed by an effective counter-response. Such a response can only be mounted by Sinhala political leaders within the government. Sadly, such a powerful response has not surfaced so far. What we have seen are apologetic semantics by the President and evasive backtracking by the Prime Minister. In essence, the government is on the defensive with weak arguments in the aftermath of just an interim report. What is needed here is a powerful political offensive in support of the proposed new Constitution. I doubt very much whether any senior minister in this Cabinet other than Mangala Samaraweera or Rajitha Senaratne would and could lead a proactive campaign in support of the Constitution at the time of the referendum.?
The tragedy of the Sinhalese and by extension Sri Lanka has been the deep seated insecurity and fears of the majority community. The Sinhala psyche has often been called a ?Majority with a minority complex.? It is only a strong, secure and confident numerical majority that will be more tolerant, accommodative and magnanimous towards numerically-smaller minorities. Sadly, the majority within the Sinhala majority continues to feel threatened and vulnerable even after the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) was militarily-defeated by the armed forces.?
?
State of mind
I was speaking to a Sinhala, left-leaning academic, hailing from the Southern province, about the current situation. This long-standing friend of mine was one who supported Sirisena and even the UNP-led front in 2015. He belongs to a family that has abhorred the ?green elephant? for decades. Yet, he voted in 2015 for the elephant symbol in order to bring about change. Today he is disgusted at the turn of events. In a long, insightful conversation, a point he emphasised strongly was the confused, indecisive state of affairs under the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe dispensation. This has affected the people on the whole and was leading to a breakdown in society. He used the term ?anomie? popularised by sociologist Durkheim to describe the condition of the people. He also concurred with me about the beleaguered state of mind among many Sinhalese.?
?
It is most unlikely that the government would have embarked upon the Constitution project and proceeded so far without some degree of confidence that the referendum battle can be fought and won
?
Again I do not wish to comment on the prevailing Sinhala state of mind and say whether it is right, wrong or in between. What is of importance here is to recognise the reality of its existence. In such a beleaguered, insecure state of mind, people believing themselves to be besieged and vulnerable can only be on the defensive and somewhat defiant. Against that backdrop, the referendum provides them an opportunity to articulate their suppressed feelings and strike a blow for themselves and against the perceived enemy. They will most likely vote against the proposed Constitution at the referendum.The Sirisena-Wickremesinghe Government has aggravated the issue by its economic policies and bad governance. Agriculture, the backbone of the nation, is being neglected while grandiose schemes to turn Lanka into a tourist and shopping paradise are being mooted.?
Cost of living keeps rising. It took about four to five years for the term ?Dharmishta Aanduwa? coined by J.R. Jayewardene to fall from grace and be mocked by the people. But in the case of ?Yahapalana,? the fall has been in less than two years. Furthermore, it is being ridiculed as ?Yamapalana.???
?
In such a situation, disappointed and frustrated people will like to display their feelings democratically at some sort of poll. Here, the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe Government has erred badly by denying the voters of their franchise. The local authority polls have been postponed for long, followed by the denial of provincial council polls. The amendments to elections, both local authorities and provincial councils, were passed in Parliament through ?unorthodox? procedures during committee stages. Denying the people of the right to vote for long periods and then providing a chance to vote at a referendum can lead to a crushing defeat for the government.?
?
?Us and Them?
Finally, there is the emotive ?us and them? syndrome in politics. The proposed Constitution with some progressive provisions to help resolve the national question through maximum devolution will cause consternation (already begun) among those perceived as Sinhala ?hawks.? The anti-Constitution referendum campaign will definitely be conducted within the Sinhala community on ethnic lines with an emotional appeal in terms of race?and religion.?
This in turn would result in similar sentiments rising to the fore among the Tamil and Muslim communities. Ultimately, the appeal to voters would turn primordial and the referendum would become an ?us versus them? contest. In such a context, a closing of ranks among the Sinhala people will result in the government facing defeat.?
For all these reasons and more, the government is very likely to lose the referendum on the Constitution, unless a political miracle occurs. The Sirisena-Wickremesinghe Government needs to proceed carefully before rushing into areas where even angels may fear to tread. Furthermore, the referendum - whatever the result - can fracture ethnic relations and further divide?
the country.?
The country needs to reconcile and the government and its allies feel the new Constitution could hasten the reconciliation process further. Winning the referendum on the Constitution is expected to boost reconciliation and ethnic harmony. It would be a cruel irony if the referendum backfires on the government and defeats the very purpose for which it was conducted.??

Mahendran pleads ignorance over ?State Banks meeting? summoned by Ravi
	
Former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran yesterday told the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) that he was unaware about the two meetings summoned by former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake, where he had asked the state banks in the presence of public officials to bid at a lower rate at the March 29 and 31, 2016 Treasury Bond auctions with a guarantee that the Central Bank would not accept other bids at a higher yield rate.
During the continuation of former Governor Arjun Mahendran?s Cross-examination Senior State Counsel (SSC) Shaida Barrie questioned him over the two meetings summoned by then Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake at the Finance Ministry on March 29, and 31, 2016.
Yesterday?s proceedings revealed that the Central Bank (CBSL) had advertised a Bond auction to be held on March 24, 2016, which was ultimately cancelled. According to SSC Shaida Barrie, at the scheduled March 24 auction, the state banks had placed their bids at a much higher rate (the prevailing market rate) and hence there was competition with regard to the bids.
According Mr. Mahendran?s testimony, the Tender Board had decided not to accept the bids received at March 24, 2016 auction due to the higher rates received at the auction.
Later, on March 29, 2016 and March 31, 2016, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka had held two bond auctions to raise funds to the Government. The advertised amount at the March 29, 2016 auction was Rs. 40 billion and it had ultimately accepted Rs. 76 billion. The advertised amount of the March 31, 2016 auction was Rs. 25 billion and the accepted amount was Rs. 50 billion.
During startling evidence by eight witnesses from the three state banks (BoC, NSB and People?s Bank), before the PCoI it was revealed on October 4, 2017 that former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake had asked the state banks to bid at lower rates at these two bond auctions with the assurance that other bids at higher rates would not be accepted. However, on both occasions at those auctions the CBSL had accepted bids much more than the advertised amount and at much higher rates.
It was revealed that former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake had held two meetings on March 28, 2016 (before the first auction) and March 30, 2016 (before the second auction) with the state banks at the Finance Ministry.
Senior State Counsel Shaida Barrie stated yesterday that in the back drop of the State Banks being asked to bid at lower rates at these auctions (March 29, 31) Perpetual Treasuries Ltd (PTL) gained considerable advantage as Aloysius had received the precise ?cut off? point (rate) about the March 29, 2016 auction which was revealed through a deleted phone conversation.
There was a deleted phone conversation earlier played before the Commission where, Aloysius was instructing his CEO Palisena on how to bid at the March 29, 2016 auction referring to vital information (including cut off rate) he received from a ?friend in the Department? and ?friends in powerful places.?. This conversation took place during mid-morning on the March 29 auction day.
Aloysius in the conversation says that there was a ?state banks meeting? that had taken place closer to that day. According to what happened at that meeting, Aloysius tells Palisena the exact rates at which the state banks (NSB, BoC, and People?s Bank) would bid at the March 29, 2016 auction.
SSC Shaida Barrie: Now you are aware that according to the evidence led before this Commission, former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake had asked the state banks to bid at lower rates, right?
Witness Mahendran: Yes, I was not here listening to the proceedings but got to know from the media reports.
SSC Shaida Barrie: So, would it be a distortion of the Market, if the Public Debt Department knew about this meeting and the Minister?s assurance to the state banks, but still went on to accept bids at higher rates?
Witness Mahendran: There are two things here. First is the instruction given by the Finance Ministry to the state banks to bid at lower rates. I don?t know whether that was true or false. As far as the Public Debt Department (PDD at (CBSL) is concerned the PDD got bids at those auctions and considering the Governments fund requirements they had accepted it. When those bids keep coming, they compare it with the previous auction and select the necessary cut off rate. Then gives to the Tender Board for approval and then comes to me for the final approval. That is the process. Don?t confuse PDD?s matters with what the Finance Ministry does.
At this moment the Senior State Counsel said that there was a phone conversation between an official of the Treasury Operation Department of People?s Bank and Mr. Sarathchandra (Superintendent of the PDD at that time), where the People?s Bank official was seeking an assurance over the undertaking given by the Minister at the meeting on the rates. Mr. Sarathchandra in the phone conversation says that he would convey the message to the Tender Board.
It was also revealed during the evidence of eight officials of NSB, BoC and People?s Bank that there were several officials present from the CBSL and the Treasury at the two meetings held with Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
At this moment Counsel Chanaka de Silva who was appearing on behalf of Mr. Mahendran objecting to the questioning moved that it was not fair to question on something which happened between third party witnesses.
The Commission was also concerned about the relevancy of the questioning.
SSC Shaida Barrie was of the view that these two auctions happened during Mr. Mahendran?s watch, so that whether he would take the responsibility on those auctions.
However, the witness said that he had absolutely no knowledge of the meetings.
SSC Shaida Barrie said that there was significant market uproar at that time regarding the two auctions that took place on March 29 and 31.
?There are uproars in various markets, this country is practicing a wide range of democracy and everybody was shouting due to that?, said witness Mahendran.
At this moment Justice Jayawardena smiled and replied ?That is true.?
When the Senior State Counsel continued to question Mahendran on the PTL?s advantages in the secondary market due to the state banks bidding at lower rates at the primary auction, Counsel Chanaka de Silva objected and said that it was based on the third party evidence and not fair to be put the witness.
He also observed that the Superintendent of the Public Debt Department was also not questioned on this regard and the officials at the Public Debt Department were treated as angels.
SSC Shaida Barrie: I suggest to you that before the March 29 and 31, 2016 auctions then Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake had asked the state banks to bid at a lower rate at the auction on the undertaking that other bids at higher rates would not be accepted. Therefore PTL on the other hand gained an advantage having possessed the precise cut off rate at the auction. Their bids were accepted at a much higher rate than the state institutions so that they gained a monopoly at the secondary market.
W: I have no any knowledge on any of these events and I can?t comment.
SSC Shaida Barrie: But those auctions took place during your tenure as the Governor. Have you heard of these things?
W: I?ve never heard about them. I got to know about them through news papers. And there should be a proper investigation. Nobody had investigated about them in great depth therefore. I don?t think anybody could come to this conclusion.
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena: Now the bids placed at the March 24 auction were not accepted on the rationale of high rates, right?
W: Yes

Post Internship appointment list: GMOA refutes HM statement
	
Refuting the statement issued by the Health Ministry claiming that the Government Medical Officers? Association (GMOA) has failed to submit any proposals to the Post Internship appointment list 2017, the GMOA yesterday said that they had officially submitted their proposals containing alternatives to the related authorities last Monday (2).
GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge told a news conference that they had written evidence to prove their claim about the submission of the said proposals even though the statement issued by a Health Ministry official, Saman Kumara, quoting Health Ministry Secretary Janaka Sugathadasa, had claimed that they had not done so by Thursday (5).
?The list was officially signed and accepted by the related authorities on October 2, following which the Transfer Board has commenced the amendments to the issued list. The GMOA representative was also represented,? he added.
He said that despite having submitted the proposals, these authorities had said that the they would implement the earlier list which contained several mistakes, since the two-day deadline given to the GMOA to submit their alternate proposals had lapsed by Thursday.
He also said Mr. Sugathadasa was also approved of this process and added that several officials including Medical Services Director Dr. Priyantha Athapaththu and a member of the Health Minister?s personal staff, Dr. Upul Gunasekara, were attempting to sabotage this process
?We have yesterday referred a letter to Mr. Sugathadasa, informing him about this issue. An investigation should be carried out by the ministry with regard to this issue. If the earlier list gets implemented without reaching any agreement we will be forced to resort to a country-wide trade union action next week,? he added.
He said they had earlier made a complaint to the Public Service Commission (PSC) against the issued list seeking an inquiry. He said that they would hold further discussions with the PSC in this regard on Monday (9). (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Earlier, the European single currency had hit a three-week pinnacle at 89.33 pence per euro.? ?
??After Theresa May?s speech at the Tory party conference on Wednesday, there are rumours that she will be asked to step down by her own party,? said City Index analyst Kathleen Brooks.? ?
??The prospect of a leaderless UK in the middle of the Brexit process, or even worse, a Prime Minister Boris (Johnson), are right to unnerve sterling traders.?

50 years on Sri Lankans still find warmth in Baba?s religion of love
	
?
Sri Sathya Sai Baba(Paththi) was one of the most influential persons in the spiritual world. In an attempt to take his legacy forward the Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Seva Samithi, established 51 years ago in Sri Lanka, has spearheaded this spiritual movement in the island nation.? Speaking to the Daily Mirror Former Regional Central Coordinator of Sri Sathya Sai Organisation Wanni Wanniyasekaram spoke about the activities of the Organisation, its service to society and local Sai devotees and future projects.??
?
The Sri Lankan public first heard of the miracles and spiritual mission of Sri Sathya Sai Baba of Puttaparthy, India through the visit of Hilda Charlton, an American psychic who arrived in Colombo back in 1965. Upon hearing her stories about Sai Baba many devotees, including M. Rajanayagam, decided to call their friends to join and listen to the experiences of the Divine. On hearing and viewing the video clippings shown by Hilda, a few enthusiastic devotees of Bhagawan Baba commenced conducting group Bhajans in their homes, mostly on Thursdays. K. Thiagarajah?s house in Wellawatte was also frequented by devotees, who then went on to conduct Sai Bhajans in Kandy, Jaffna and Batticaloa.??

Upon hearing her stories about Sai Baba many devotees, including M. Rajanayagam, decided to call their friends to join and listen to the experiences of the Divine.?
?
?What followed was the establishment of the first Sri Sathya Sai Seva Samithi in Sri Lanka, which was registered in Puttaparthy in 1967 by this group,? recalls Wanni. ?Thereafter the group decided that the official inauguration of the premier Samithi in Sri Lanka be held with the presence of the then International Chairman, Indulal Shah. Hence, the Samithi was officially named as the Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Seva Samithi in Colombo. Later on the Sai Mandir was established in Barnes Place where it currently stands with the support of Meena Rutnam, who gifted the 64-perch land,? said Wanni.?
According to Wanni, in April 1968 Bhagawan Baba convened a World Conference of the Sai Organisations. One of the decisions made there was that each town should have only one Sathya Sai Centre with the President, Secretary and a Convener to conduct Bhajans. At the conclusion of the second World Conference, Baba was pleased with the work done in Sri Lanka and appointed C. Balasingham, as a member of the World Council of the Sathya?
Sai Organisation. Taking his memories back as an active Regional Central Coordinator at the time, Wanni proudly spoke about the establishment of Sathya Sai Education in Human Values (SSEHV). ?Since 1969 Sri Lanka has been one of the nations that introduced SSEHV in the form of Bai Vikas education. This was dedicated to children of Sai devotee families and took place at individual Samithi levels and soon spread throughout the island. One of the most significant milestones of SSEHV activities was the establishment of the first dedicated Sathya Sai School in Jaffna. The school commenced operations with just 25 pre-school students, but has made tremendous progress over the years. Another Children?s home was opened in Vavuniya along with an elders? home in Hanwella,?said Wanni.?
?
The Sathya Sai Institute for Human Value Education of Sri Lanka was inaugurated in June 2004 by Dr. (Mrs) Tara De Mel with several objectives. Some of these objectives include providing support to teachers and parents through appropriate books
?
In 1996 a few Sri Lankan devotees, led by Dr. Seevali and Mrs. Ratwatte, were at Whitefield on Vesak Poya day holding a traditional tray with lights to signify the importance of Vesak. ?When Baba asked them what that tray was, the trio explained to Him about the importance of Vesak and that He (Sai Baba) should bless the people of Sri Lanka on this day. Baba blessed the people and upon request He graciously approved the prayer and request to observe Vesak in the Divine presence. This was well received by the rest of the Buddhist countries in the Asia Pacific region. Towards this objective the Secretariat has undertaken to celebrate Vaisakha Buddha Poornima, the thrice blessed day of the Buddhist calendar,? recalled Wanni.??
Another national project of the Sai Organisation in Sri Lanka was the establishment of the Sathya Sai Suwa Sevana ? a home for symptom control and palliative care for cancer patients, which commenced operations in July 2002. In addition to that a Sarva Dharma Shrine too was unveiled by Ryuko Hira, Chairman for?Asia-Pacific regions.??
The Sathya Sai Institute for Human Value Education of Sri Lanka was inaugurated in June 2004 by Dr. (Mrs) Tara De Mel with several objectives. Some of these objectives include providing support to teachers and parents through appropriate books, providing for the Government and private sector educational institutions, facilitating the establishment of Sathya Sai schools in Sri Lanka among others. Presently the construction of a separate Bhajan hall is underway and would be completed soon.??
In conclusion, Wanni further requested the youth to engage in these activities as they have to carry the spirit of Baba forward. ?Through the Bhagavan Sri Sathya Sai Seva Samithi Colombo Youth Wing we have done several projects including a clean up in the Mattakkuliya area. Volunteer doctors have also been conducting medical camps for the past 15 years. Other projects include community mobilisation and empowerment. We would like to encourage the youth to join our activities. Add some spirituality into your lives and stay away from stress. It will definitely help you in the long run,?
advised Wanni.?
