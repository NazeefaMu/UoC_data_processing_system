A land sale move that stinks of skullduggery
	
?
A story has gone viral in political and TU circles about an underhand move being made by some bigwigs of a Ministry handling the country?s public transport to sell off some tracts of prime land belonging to a department coming under its purview skipping the proper procedure.?
?
A political authority had initiated this underhand move despite the policy upheld over the years to transform these tracts of land into viable revenue sources in order to place the loss-making department on a sound financial footing, they say.
A comely lady who held secretarial status in a Ministry held by the political authority earlier has been assigned the task of finalizing the preliminaries in connection with the sale of the extensive tracts of land belonging to the loss-making department.?
Meanwhile, certain highly concerned organized sections in the department are poised to swing into action and are closely monitoring the situation, they say.

A truth meant only for the caller?s ear
	
?
There were varying estimates of the turnout for the recent JO-sponsored Paadayathra and the new Big Boss had wanted to know the most accurate figure for his own edification.
?
? As there were wide discrepancies between the figures given by state intelligence sources and certain private sources close to him, he decided to obtain the most realistic figure from the horse?s mouth itself.?
So the new Big Boss contacted a JO stalwart ? a former purohita with a big mouth -- who shed much sweat to make the event a great success. ? He made his query right away. ?Tell me the truth. What is your estimate of the number that participated in your Paadayathra?? ?
The JO stalwart from the upcountry who was taken aback by the unexpected question took a few seconds to collect his scattered wits before giving an answer.?
Presently, he had looked around to make sure there was none within the earshot; re-assured, he had whispered his reply into the mouthpiece of the telephone, they say. ?

Ambitious quartet elated over astrologer?s assurance
	
?
Many politicos in the country had made it a point to consult leading astrologers in the country to get a reading of their future given the far reaching significance attached to Jupiter?s recent transit.
?
Most of them had called on an astrologer who had been a consultant to the leadership of the previous regime.
There were four prominent politicians among those who had approached the astrologers to find out the impact that Jupiter?s transit to a new Zodiac sign would make on their political career and this foursome had been highly concerned over the recent planetary event fearing a possibly a far worse period ahead as they are already under the malefic influence of a Shani Erashtaka.?
The foursome are now highly elated over what the astrologer had predicted regarding their future, they say.
All the four political bigwigs currently going through the Shani Erashtaka are said to be Libra (Thula) natives. One of them is now occupying a very high seat in yahapalanaya.
One of the remaining three is holding a high office in the Diyawanna council. The other two are team members at the top table. ?Of the two, one is from Kalutara who is credited to have done much spadework to bring yahapalanaya into power. ?The other one is a party leader who teamed up with the Greens quite recently.?
By the way, the astrologer had assured these Libra natives that the Erashtaka ? the malefic period they were running would end by next January.

Angelo Perera in squad for second ODI
	
Sri Lanka have made one change to the squad for tomorrow?s second One Day International against Australia with Angelo Perera coming in for injured fast bowler Nuwan Pradeep, captain Angelo Mathews said today.
Mathews also said that the final was not decided as yet, but that a few changes may be likely.
?We have still not decided on the batting line-up for tomorrow, but there is a good chance that Angelo Perera and Seekuge Prasanna will feature in the team tomorrow,? Mathews said. ?We have not made a final decision yet.?
?If we take these conditions into consideration, there isn?t much assistance for fast bowlers. Our strength is our spinners. That is how we planned for the Test Series and we will go with the same plan for this game,? Mathews also said. ?
Coach Graham Ford reiterated that a final decision on personnel had not been taken yet, and that they would look at the pitch tomorrow before making naming the final XI.
Discussing Sunday?s defeat Ford saidl, ?Australia played some good cricket. The pitch was a tough pitch and felt that scraping our way to 227 was quite a good effort. Chandimal played really well and young Mendis played extremely well. We weren?t at our best with the ball, and weren?t our best on the field. Sometimes you need a few things to go your way as well. [I] Thought Australia bowled really well on that surface and finding runs wasn?t easy. [It was a] Tough game and that?s expected from the best team in the world.?

Government Spokesman and Minister Rajitha Senaratne said building Buddhist temples, placing Buddha statues under Bo-trees and at junctions by the security forces after defeating the LTTE in the North-East had not done any good other than to negate the government's reconciliation efforts.
?On several occasions, I spoke to President Mahinda Rajapaksa on this matter. He accepted the negative impact of these actions but said it was not possible to stop armed forces personnel from doing so,? he said.
The minister said though places of religious observances had been erected at every opportunity, there were no Buddhist devotees to maintain them resulting in these places being abandoned.(Sandun A Jayasekera)

The purohita whom the country looked on as a national hero particularly in the 1996-97 period, had also told his friends that he had decided to adopt the ?come what may, I will remain unmoved attitude? in future. ? ??

Even MR's family members may be removed: WP CM
	
President Maithripala Sirisena has taken upon himself the duty of purging the SLFP of destructive elements and in the process even Mahinda Rajapaksa family members may their positions as party organisers, Western Province Chief Minister Isuru Devapriya said yesterday.
He said last week's appointment of 40 new electoral organizers by the SLFP Central Committee on the instructions of party leader and President Sirisena last week was aimed at taking the party towards victory at the forthcoming local government polls and 2020 parliamentary elections.
The chief minister told the media that there were more black sheep who had violated the party constitution, insulted the party leadership, hooted at the party head office and committed several other unforgivable acts of treachery against the party and deserved immediate expulsion.
?There will be a full cleansing and reorganization of the SLFP and in due course all those who betrayed the party will be removed from their positions. President Sirisena as the party leader had a lot of patience and gave more than enough opportunities to those who acted against the party and the party leadership to mend their ways.
Some party members and supporters even blamed the party leadership for treating the betrayers leniently. Now he has taken the sword into his hands and there will be more cleansing being carried out in the days to come with even members of the Rajapaksa family losing their posts as party organisers,? the chief minister said.
Responding to a journalist, he said nearly all those who had been removed would be unable to obtain one-tenth of the votes they polled as SLFP candidates because people voted for the party and not for individuals.
The chief minister said those who had been expelled from the SLFP organizer posts had done no party work at their respective districts and constituencies during the past 18 months other than to insult the party leadership and undermine the SLFP.
In response to another journalist, he said those who have resigned from party organizer posts on their own were to be expelled for sure and the members of the joint opposition were in the final stages of their term in parliament and none of them would be re-elected at the next polls.
?This will be their last hurrah in their political life,? the CM said.
Commenting on the future of the consensual or unity government, he said it would be the President and nobody else who would decide on the continuation of the unity government after 2020.
However, Mr. Devapriya said those who had been expelled still had the opportunity to plead for forgiveness, pledge allegiance and and re-join the party.
On certain party organizers who continue to work against the party but had not been expelled, he said no one knows whether they had a secret deal with the party leadership. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) said yesterday it would update the Mahasangha Sabha of the Ramanna Nikaya on the proposed Indo-Lanka Economic and Technology Cooperation (ETCA) on an invitation to do so.
It said the Chief Incumbent of the Atamasthana would also have a discussion with the GMOA on matters connected to ETCA.
The GMOA told a media conference said they would conduct an awareness programme on the ?cheap attempt? being made by the government to sign the ETCA in October while concealing the true facts.
With President Maithripala Sirisena assuring he will to comply with the advice of the Mahasangha in governing the country and making nationally important decisions, the GMOA said it expected to urge the President through the Mahasangha on matters concerning ETCA.
The main issue which irks the GMOA is the government's approach towards ETCA in the absence of formulating a national policy on international trade pacts.
GMOA Media Spokesman Samantha Ananda said those who have been appointed to formulate a national policy were not following the standard procedure and trying to complete the task carelessly by the given deadline.
?We have informed the President regarding the futile attempts made by a few officers to formulate the national policy for ETCA without a national policy. The officers have been identified as pro-Indians,? Dr. Ananda said.(Piyumi Fonseka)

Money politics still mar democratic elections in SL: election body
	
Money politics, weak political parties and violence still mar democratic elections in Asian countries including Sri Lanka, Asia Network for Free and Fair Elections (ANFREL) chairperson Damaso G. Magbual stated today.
Mr. Magbual said candidates in Nepal and Sri Lanka could spend 15 times their annual salaries to participate in elections ? a bad precedent that could discriminate qualified people from taking part in the democratic process.
?The laws in those countries don?t provide limits on how much money the candidate can spend. This is not a fair election practice,? he said during the Asian Electoral Stakeholder Forum III at the Discovery Kartika Plaza Hotel in Bali.
According to Magbual, political parties? weaknesses could be clearly seen in the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Cambodia, citing as an example that politicians in the Philippines changed political parties ?as fast as they change their clothes?.
?This practice is bad. Political parties are supposed to define policies and propose programs to government. If [politicians] keep changing political parties, it means that political parties stand for nothing,? Magbual stressed, adding that Asian countries could take an example from India where candidates who leave their political parties must forfeit their seats.
Meanwhile, violence in the implementation of elections still occurs in Cambodia, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and the Philippines. He cited that previously, politicians in Cambodia had tried to intimidate and eliminate other potential candidates in the upcoming 2017 election.(The Jakarta post)

SL backs UN talks to eliminate nuclear weapons
	
Sri Lanka would support the convening of a conference next year to negotiate a legally binding instrument to prohibit nuclear weapons leading towards their total elimination, Ambassador to the UN in Geneva Ravinatha Aryasinha said.
He made these observations during an intervention by Sri Lanka at the third and final session of the General Assembly mandated Open ? Ended Working Group (OEWG) on Taking Forward Multilateral Nuclear Disarmament Negotiations, held in Geneva last week.
During its final plenary meeting held on August 18, the group had adopted a report by vote, and recommend to the General Assembly to convene a conference in 2017 to negotiate a legally binding instrument to prohibit nuclear weapons.
Expressing concern on the slow progress made over the decades on international multilateral nuclear disarmament efforts, Ambassador Aryasinha had noted that an agreement on a negotiation to eliminate nuclear weapons would ensure the fulfilment of the wish of the UN membership at large.
According to a statement issued by the Ambassador?s Office, he had said Sri Lanka together with the G- 21 members would continue to work in favour of a comprehensive nuclear weapons convention at the Conference on Disarmament.
?Sri Lanka considers that it is reasonable for the G-21 States to also extend support for other processes on nuclear disarmament such as the negotiation of a prohibition treaty, which can lead to the ultimate objective of complete elimination of nuclear weapons,? he said.
He further stressed that this is an opportunity for States to come up with concrete steps on multilateral nuclear disarmament.

The threats would only be directed to the formation of new parties, former president Mahinda Rajapaksa said yesterday.
Addressing the 19th commemoration of All Island Samurdhi Development and Agricultural Research Production Assistant Officers Society, Mr. Rajapaksa said each and every person had the right to form political parties.
?No force can stop the formation of political parties. It is a normal procedure. There should be enough independence within the country to form new parties. Each person should have its independence to take decisions,? he added.
He said the threats would not affect such moves and they would only motivate somebody to form a new party.
?Political thinking of persons cannot be concealed by a threat or any other force. Taking into remand custody will also not affect some one?s political life,? he added.
He said there were no president in the Sri Lankan history who made such a statement and only former president Ranasinghe Premadasa made such a statement in the latter period of his regime.
He said he would not prefer to continue these discussions further as he has no concern for hatred and envy in his political life.
Meanwhile, he said now the UNP and the SLFP had been combined under the Government?s pretext to safeguard the democracy in the country.
?The UNP and SLFP have come to an agreement for two years to work together and now it has extended up to five years. Some politicians declare that they would rule the country in the same manner even after the five years,? he added.
He said the policies and the principles of these two parties were completely different. He also said if the Government had wished to use the current procedure even in the future, they would have to dissolve both the parties and form a new party.
?If not the SLPFers who are in favour of the UNP have to recruit in to it and the SLFP should be hand over to the ones who are in favour of it? he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Tussle over high post takes a holiday
	
?
A cold war that raged over the highest post in the army ceased when the incumbent was finally granted a one-year service extension.?
?
The service extension thus granted also put paid to the ambitions nurtured by seven or eight in the line of succession who were eying the prestigious post.?
Championing of the hopefuls for the coveted post on the basis of their old school ties as well as usual political maneuverings had their full play behind both the cold war and the granting of the extension, they say.?
A certain group had heavily lobbied to have the service extension to the incumbent one pruned to six months to make way for a ?Thilaka? of their choice.?
Meanwhile, a political figure with ties to the army had made representations to those in the highest echelons on behalf of a kin of his now functioning as a commander of a certain area. ?However, the contender he backed will attain the required seniority only in another one year and that accounts for the one-year extension granted to the incumbent, says an informed source. ?
