Asia-Pacific sovereign rating trends should remain stable despite growing economic uncertainties: S&
	
		 		 
		 
			
Standard & Poor?s (S&P) Ratings Services continues to expect stable trends for most sovereign credit ratings in Asia-Pacific despite the growing economic uncertainties this year, according to a report published yesterday, titled, ?Asia-Pacific Sovereign Rating Trends Mid-Year 2015?.
?We do not expect weakening of some credit metrics so far this year to be material enough to trigger sovereign downgrades,? said Standard & Poor?s credit analyst Kim Eng Tan.?
China?s continuing slowdown, its struggle with asset deflation and the on-going uncertainties in the eurozone weigh on Asia-Pacific?s growth prospects. Factors supporting economic growth in the region are the continuing U.S. economic recovery, lower energy prices and still-plentiful liquidity in financial markets.
The continuing slowdown in China?s growth has weighed on other Asia-Pacific economies. Other factors adding to the perception of risk include China?s property market correction and its on-going stock market turmoil.?
?The deteriorating situation in Greece raises uncertainties further. We believe that the spillover from a potential Greek exit from the eurozone--somewhat less likely after the events in recent days--would be limited, given its small economy and limited international financial linkages,? Tan said.?
?Nevertheless, an unexpectedly severe and prolonged turn of international investor confidence cannot be ruled out.?
We do not believe domestic political developments in some Asian countries will affect the related sovereign ratings in the next one to two years.?
Nevertheless, they reduce the likelihood of new structural reform initiatives. They could also hurt the responsiveness of the governments to unexpected shocks.

Video: Be cruel to be kind: Keep Mahinda out - Ranil
	
	Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who kicked off the election campaign of the United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG) in Kandy this evening requested the people to have pity on former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and his loyalists and stop them from coming into parliament.
	Mr. Wickremesinghe made this jocular remark with reference to President Maithripala Sirisena's observation that those who rob public funds would be reborn as crows and dogs. ?Have pity on Rajapaksa and his loyalists and stop them from coming to power as they will be corrupt once again if they do, and will apparently be reborn as crows and dogs as President Sisisena said,? he told the listeners.
	Mr. Wickremesinghe made several pledges concerning the economy, and promised that the whole Western Province would be converted into one mega city, while the city of Kandy would be made a city similar to Colombo. He said Kandy would be expanded. He also pledged to create 48 industrial zones with all infrastructural facilities. He said the industrial zones would be like divisional secretariats with all infrastructural facilities.
	Also it was announced that work on the Colombo Kandy highway would be begun before the general elections.
	Mr.Karunanayake said gas prices would be reduced by Rs 100.
	Ministers Patali Champika Ranawaka, Arjuna Ranatunga and Rajitha Senaratne pledged that they, together with President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, would form the next government after August 17. These statements were made just before President Sirisena announced that he would remain neutral at the elections.
	The crossover of former JVP MP Dimuthu Bandara Wijekoon to the United National Front for Good Governance was a notable feature at the opening rally.? (Yohan Perera in Kandy - With additional reporting by J. A. L. Jayasinghe and L B. Senaratne)

Audio: BJP calls for unity among party leaders
	
	Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and ex-president Mahinda Rajapaksa should not treat each other as enemies when contesting the general elections, Bodu Jana Peramuna (BJP) Leader and BBS General Secretary Ven. Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thera said today.
	He asked former President Chandrika Kumaranatunga not to treat Mahinda Rajapaksa with enmity and that Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Udaya Gammanpila, Champika Ranawake, Wimal Weerawansa and the JVP should forget their political differences and treat each other with respect and honour.
	?We should consider these people as Sri Lankans and should work under a national policy for at least two years. Party leaders should cooperate with each other because if not it will be catestrophic for Sri Lanka,? the Thera said.
	He recalled that in 1815 the country was handed over to the British on an agreement.
	?A repetition seems likely after 200 years during and after the election,? the Thera said.
	He said the BJP had submitted nomination lists for 16 of the 22 districts. (Chaturanga Pradeep) ?

The Fundamental Rights Petition filed by Supreme Court Judge Sarath De Abrew was withdrawn today, after Counsel informed court that there was no danger of imminent arrest of the judge.
President?s Counsel Manohara De Silva appearing on behalf of the Judge said that since Justice Abrew was enlarged on bail, there was no danger of imminent arrest and accordingly there was no necessity to proceed with the Fundamental Rights Petition.
Having heard the application by the Counsel, the bench headed by Chief Justice S. Sripavan granted permission to the Petitioner to withdraw the case.

Former Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake's son Shaveen is contesting the upcoming general election from the Colombo District as an independent candidate under the 'flashlight symbol'.
He said he had decided to contest after his involvement in a social justice movement known as the ?Campaign for Clean and Competent Candidates.?
?My main objective is not so much to enter parliament but to canvass for the election of clean, competent, educated and honest parliamentarians. My other objective is to introduce a mechanism ? a review system ? to make sure that once such candidates are elected to parliament, they themselves are not tainted with fraud or corruption,? he said.
Mr. Bandaranayake said he did not view himself as a politician but more as a public servant. (Shihara Maduwage)

Fitch downgrades Siyapatha Finance to ?A-(lka)?
	
		 		 
		 
			
Fitch Ratings Lanka has downgraded Siyapatha Finance PLC?s (SLFL) national long-term rating to ?A-(lka)? from ?A(lka)?. The outlook is stable.?
The agency has also downgraded the national long-term ratings on SLFL?s outstanding senior unsecured debentures to ?A-(lka)? from ?A(lka)? and outstanding subordinated debentures to ?BBB+(lka)? from ?A-(lka)?.
The downgrade of SLFL?s rating follows the downgrade of its parent, Sampath Bank PLC?s national long-term rating to ?A+(lka)? from ?AA-(lka)? on July 8, 2015. It reflects Sampath Bank?s decreased ability to support SLFL. Fitch continues to believe that support for SLFL would be forthcoming from Sampath Bank, if needed.
SLFL is rated two notches below its parent, reflecting full ownership by Sampath Bank and the bank?s influence on SLFL?s strategic direction through representation on the finance company?s board. Funding from its parent accounted for 15 percent of SLFL?s total borrowings at end-March 2015. However, Fitch expects the share of deposits in SLFL?s funding profile to increase after the regulator gave approval for it to be a Licensed Finance Company (LFC) in 2013, which allows SLFL to collect deposits.
The two-notch differential also reflects SLFL?s limited role in the group with leasing accounting for just 4 percent of group advances at end-2014, of which SLFL provided 29 percent. Since its conversion to a LFC, SLFL ceased to share a common brand with its parent while branches situated within Sampath Bank?s premises have also decreased. SLFL?s contribution to group profit remains low, averaging 5 percent of group profit for 2012 to 2014. Fitch does not view a potential disposal of SLFL, which is not being planned, as being material to the group.
SLFL?s outstanding senior debentures are rated at the same level as SLFL?s national long-term rating, as they constitute direct, unconditional, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the company.

Kurunegala will be MR's Waterloo: Akila Viraj
	
	Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, who leads the UNP's Kurunegala district team, vowed to defeat former president Mahinda Rajapaksa in Kurunegala similar to that of Napoleon Bonaparte, who was considered invincible but was defeated at Waterloo.
	He told a news conference at Sirikotha that Mr. Rajapaksa had chosen to contest from Kurunegala in the face of waning public support in his home district of Hambantota.
	?Kurunegala is not his but our home district. We have travelled the length and breadth of the district. If he wins, he will leave for Hambantota leaving the people of Kurunegala in the lurch. We are certain we can defeat him. During World War 1, Napoleon Bonaparte considered invincible but was beaten at the battle of Waterloo. Likewise, we too will defeat Mr. Rajapaksa at the battle of Kurunegala. Adolf Hitler, the supreme commander of the armed forces during the World War II, was also defeated in a similar fashion,? the minister said.
	He said the people of Kurunegala were intelligent voters and the UNP would increase its vote base this time without any problem. The minister said the UPFA had given nominated candidates tainted with allegations of fraud, corruption and other criminal activities.
	"This will be a plus point for the UNP to secure an election victory," the minister said and added that he would write to the Elections Commissioner asking to make sure that the privileges Mr. Rajapaksa is entitled to as an ex-president were not misused or abused as a candidate at this election.

President Maithripala Sirisena said he would remain neutral at the general election and won?t back former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
He said that he is against Mr. Rajapaksa and that there are many seniors he could appoint as Prime Minister in the event the SLFP wins at the general elections. He said that irrespective of the party that comes to power, he wants those who could carry his pledges forward to be elected.
President? Sirisena said that he was totally against the granting of nominations to Mahinda Rajapaksa, and said that Mr. Rajapaksa would lose the upcoming general elections similar to his loss on January 8.
He said that this is not the fault of Mahinda Rajapaksa but due to the system introduced by J.R. Jayawardena. Following a long and stony silence, President Sirisena finally addressed the nation and said that he is aware of the ?insults? hurled at him during the past two weeks.
?There has not been a President who has been insulted like I have been? he said addressing the media. He said that this was the vibrancy of the freedom enjoyed by Sri Lankans post January 8 and said that he is aware of what would have befallen those who had made such insults prior to the Presidential election.
He further defended his decision to take over the leadership of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) saying that the decision paved the way for constitutional reform which would not have been possible.
?If Mahinda Rajapaksa was the leader, these reforms would not have been possible? he said. The speech which commenced a short while ago at the Presidential Secretariat is continuing.Pix by Presidents' Media Division

	The newly formed United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG) is made up of several politicians who were displaced in the wake of President Maithripala Sirisena deciding to nominate Mahinda Rajapaksa, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today.
	JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva said those who opposed the United National Party (UNP) led government had withdrawn their objections before signing the Memorandum of Understanding for political benefits.
	He said some of them had put aside their party identities and their party symbol and the leadership because they would not have otherwise been in a position to contest the general election on their own steam.
	?They are not politically stable because people are aware how they ruined the country during the much hyped 100-day programme. Apart from strengthening the their political standing, nothing worthwhile had taken place in the country during past six months. At the end of the day people have been made to realise that the JVP is the only party which can rule a country where the rights and needs of ordinary people will be prioritized,? Mr. Silva said.
	He said the SLFP and UNP nomination lists did not reflect PAFFREL?s March 12 guidelines and the criteria agreed to by all political parties when selecting candidates.
	?The JVP will not hesitate to refuse nominations to anyone if he or she if facing credible allegations of wrongdoing. We have done so in the past as well. The SLFP has nominated politicians who were even imprisoned on charges of various criminal activities. They have done nothing to clean up their act. The national lists of both parties consist of politicians who are unable to contest because they have been rejected by the people,? Mr. Silva said.
	He said the JVP launched its election campaign yesterday from Maharagama under the theme ?Conscience of the Nation? and that 100 public rallies and one thousand provincial meetings will be carried out countrywide. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Southern Provincial Councillor Geetha Kumarasinghe said today the drug menace in the country could not be eliminated by refusing nominations to a few MPs charged with involvement in drug trafficking.
She said there was no doubt that the drug menace should be eradicated from Sri Lanka?s soil and safeguard the younger generation suffering directly or indirectly because of drug addiction.
?Anyone can make allegations but they have to be proved in courts. We cannot eradicate the drug menace by refusing nominations to a few individuals,? Ms. Kumarasinghe said.
She said she spent her private funds for the benefit of the people whereas some others were involved in corruption and fraud.
?I am contesting the general election not to gain anything for myself. I have obtained all I need,? she said.
When asked about the incidents that she was involved in during the past with the politicians of the same party, Ms. Kumarasinghe said she had no rivals at present and that she hoped to carry out the political campaign with her rivals peacefully and added that those who were against her in Benthara Elpitiya had also extended support to her.
She thanked President Maithripala Sirisenafor giving nominations to ex-president Mahinda Rajapaksa because he was the one who rescued the country from the clutches of the terrorists and should be handed over the country again. (Ajith Siriwardana)

The Sri Lanka Institute of Credit Management (SLICM) announced that it has successfully completed its third batch and that applications are now open for the fourth batch of the Certificate in Micro Credit Management Programme.?
The SLICM launched the Micro Credit Management programme to its first batch of students in December 2013 and the next batch is commencing from end of July, according to the academic body.
The duration of the programme is four months and is being conducted in the Sinhala medium. The programme covers key areas in micro credit management such as evaluation and appraisal of credit applications, client servicing, delinquency management as well as social performance indicators.?
SLICM Vice President/ Arpico Finance Director Lyle Peiris said, ?Our journey has begun through the amalgamation of the best of class industry leaders. The SLICM is at the forefront of credit education and we are constantly striving to understand the credit aspects in micro finance and training in credit management.??
SLICM Treasurer/Alliance Finance Deputy Chairman Romani De Silva stated, ?We are happy to see the acceptance of this significant area of the finance sector. Micro finance is a very lucrative area of business for the financial services sector. However, the risks involved in this area are considerably higher as a result of limited asset backed lending.?
Furthermore, the social risk of this business model is high as the target market segment is from less affluent economic backgrounds. Hence, microfinance is very economically, socially and politically sensitive. As such proper education and training is an absolute must for anyone interested in working in the microfinance sector.?
The programme is facilitated by practitioners in the industry who have decades of experience. ?The faculty along with SLICM have been able to very successfully cater to the needs of the participants and as such the feedback received from the industry so far has been very positive. The success of this cohort has encouraged SLICM to launch the fourth batch in late July 2015,? added R. Muralidharan, the Chairman of Asian International Academy, the study centre of Sri Lanka Institute of Credit Management. ?
The SLICM was started in 1988 as a pioneering education project by the leading finance companies intending to fill a vacuum in the leasing and finance-related companies in Sri Lanka. In the year 2000, it was enacted by the Parliament of Sir Lanka and cited that the Sri Lanka Institute of Credit Management be incorporated under Act No. 07 of 2000. SLICM has over 25 years of experience in delivering educational programmes in credit management specifically designed to uplift the credit management skills of the Sri Lankan professionals.

UK Russell Investments? MD to deliver keynote at Capital Market Awards
	
		 		 
		 
			
The Capital Market Awards and Forecast Dinner, which is the flagship annual event of CFA Sri Lanka, will feature UK Russell Investments Managing Director (MD) and Head of Pension Solutions Group Shamindra Perera as the keynote speaker this year.?
Endorsed by the Colombo Stock Exchange and Securities and Exchange Commission, the fundamental objective of the awards is to inspire and incentivize capital market participants and members of wider stakeholder groups to strive for standards of excellence. ?
Each year, the featured keynote speakers have been eminent personalities whose knowledge sharing on global and regional experiences have been of immense value in facilitating continuous market development and promoting best practices.?
This year, the gathered regulators, stockbrokers, analysts, CFA Charterholders and the senior management of listed companies will gain the expertise of Perera, who is responsible for developing and delivering strategy and implementation solutions to institutional clients in both the UK and Ireland, including fiduciary management and investment management of multi-asset portfolios. ?
Perera, who was one of the first two Charterholders in Sri Lanka and now lives in London, in 2002, developed the company?s private client business strategy in EMEA.?
It was he who launched the outsourced multi-manager fund platform for a UK private bank at the time. His prowess continued as over the next few years, he began developing and managing Russell?s business across the Middle East, working with several sovereign wealth funds, forming numerous strategic alliances with banks across the region and launching an innovative Shariah compliant multi-manager investment platform. ?
For the last five years, Perera has been focusing on institutional business and has been instrumental in evolving Russell?s fiduciary management offering, including developing the strategic alliance with Aon Consulting UK, designing and delivering an integrated asset liability management solution for the UK pension funds. ?
Building his keynote address around the theme ?Be the one investors seek?, Perera will elaborate on common characteristics inherent in outstanding analysts, fund managers and internationally-acclaimed asset management companies, best practices followed by listed companies whose investor relations functions can be emulated and share his own experiences of the journey he has travelled as an internationally recognised fund manager. ?
Perera?s keynote address will be followed by a panel discussion, based on the salient points within the address. Ironwood Capital Partners Managing Partner Chanaka Wickramasuriya CFA will moderate the panel comprising Lynear Wealth Managing Director Dr. Naveen Gunawardena and Asia Securities Managing Director Dumith Fernando. ?
The highlight of the event is the Capital Market Awards Ceremony, where awards will be presented for the Best Equity Research Report in Gold, Silver and Bronze for individual research analysts/teams (selected from among stockbroking firms). An award for the Best Stockbroking Research Team (based on a poll among user groups and scored by an independent panel of judges) will also be presented besides awarding the Best Investor Relations function presented by a listed corporate. The latter is adjudged on a secret poll from among user groups and presents Gold, Silver and Bronze awards. ?
CFA Society Sri Lanka President Sanjay Kulatunga commends the quality of research reports that have been produced by financial analysts over the last two years since the awards were mooted. ?
?We have observed a tremendous improvement in these reports which is reflective of the calibre of professionals and teams whose acumen, capabilities, knowledge and competencies clearly continue raising the bar in producing such quality reports. ?The awards have also been a catalyst in inspiring individuals to strive for excellence, while aspiring for recognition which permeates to adding value to their career paths.? ?
He mentioned that listed companies too have become more aware of improving investor relations and being more stakeholder savvy, gradually imbuing best practices, which is highly encouraging. ?
?These awards are meant to recognise the achievements and contribution made by analysts and researchers towards maintaining and advancing the integrity of local capital markets. We remain enthusiastic about continuing to integrate CFA Sri Lanka?s vision of shaping a trustworthy, forward-thinking financial industry into strengthening the blueprint we have now formulated for the evolution of a stronger, stable and forward-thinking financial ecosystem.?

	The UPFA said today it would win easily at the general election because the 6.2 million who voted for President Sirisena at the presidential election would not vote for the UNFGG though 5.8 million who voted for Mahinda Rajapaksa would do so.
	UPFA General Secretary Susil Premajayantha told a news conference the 600,000 Tamil votes 700,000 JVP votes must be reduced from the votes polled by President Sirisena.
	"It means 1.3 million deducted from the 6.2 million the UNFGG is hoping to obtain," he said. ?We have won 10 out of 22 districts at the January 8 presidential election. We lost three districts -- Badulla, Gampaha and Puttalam in a close fight and there is no doubt that we can regain those easily at the election. Then Polonnaruwa district is an absolute win for the UPFA making it 14 out 22 districts for the UPFA. Then we will get 14 bonus seats also from the 14 districts we will win. In contrast, the UNFGG will be left only with four districts to win as Jaffna, Vanni, Batticaloa and Trincomalee will be won by the TNA and the SLMC. In that background how can the UNFGG win a minimum 113 seats to form a government."
	NFF leader Wimal Weerawansa said a discussion was held with President Sirisena on the election campaign strategy and the possibility of the President taking the UPFA stage.
	?Sensing the imminent defeat after the unity in the UPFA and arrival of Mr. Rajapaksa, the UNFGG has resorted to dirty tactics. They are using the state media for their election propaganda campaign and using huge cutouts by some ministers at public places despite their criticism of the UPFA during the presidential poll,?

He said the decision to refuse nominations to some former MPs over allegations of involvement in drug trafficking and corruption was unfair because none of these allegations were proved in court.
