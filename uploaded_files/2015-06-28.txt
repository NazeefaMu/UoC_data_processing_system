Ex-Tiger?s application for poll ticket puts ITAK in fix
	
An application by a former top LTTE leader, Athmalingam Ravindra alias Ruban, for an Ilankai Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK) ticket to contest the August 17 Sri Lankan parliamentary elections, may have put the ITAK in a fix.
Since the end of Eelam War IV in May 2009, the ITAK has been avoiding ex-LTTE cadres on the grounds that it has eschewed violence and is now a ?Gandhian? party, unlike other parties in the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) which have a militant and ?bloody? past. The ITAK, founded by Eelaththu Gandhi SJ.V.Chelvanayakam, is the dominant constituent of the four-party TNA.
Keeping the reservations in view, Ruban has pointed out in his application that ITAK chief, Mavai Senathirajah, has himself proudly reminisced about the time he spent in the Batticaloa jail as a young militant, and has described as ?unforgettable? his first meeting with LTTE Supremo Velupillai Prabhakaran.
Rupan reminded the other top ITAK leader, R.Sampanthan, that it was Prabhakaran and he? who had ensured his entry into parliament? from Trincomalee district in December 2001 by securing for the TNA 66,500 votes when, only an year earlier in the October 2000 parliamentary elections, the TNA could bag only 13,000 votes in that district. ?
Delineating his long political experience, Ruban said that he had been a representative of the LTTE in the Interim Council set up in the North-Eastern Province following the India-Sri Lanka Accord in 1987; and was part of the LTTE?s delegation which held talks with President Premadasa in 1990.
Ruban said that for 24 years, from May 1985 to May 2009, he had served the Tamil militant movement and the Tamil people. And now, he is keen on serving the ex-militants and the Tamil people as a parliamentarian, he asserted.
If elected, Rupan will be the first LTTE cadre or leader to get into parliament through an election. LTTE?s former Batticaloa area Commander ?Col?.Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan alias Karuna Amman, who was Deputy Minister of National Integration in the Rajapaksa government, was only a nominated MP.

I have a Presidential mania: Somawansa
	
I have a Presidential mania and not a mania for Parliamentary membership, the former leader of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Somawansa Amarasinghe said.
?I have a Presidential mania, but it is aimed at the abolition of executive presidency as stressed by our leader comrade Rohana Wijeweera? Amarasinghe stated while addressing the first convention of his newly formed party, Janatha Sevaka Paksaya (JSP).
Addressing the gathering at the Colombo New Town Hall on Saturday he posed the question as to what is wrong in supporting President Maithripala Sirisena who had forgone powers of Executive Presidency.
Amarasinghe said that the JVP founded by Rohana Wijeweera only with five members in order to fight for social justice and democracy had lost its identity now creating a huge void in the political arena and that he formed the new party to fill the gap.
Referring to the alleged Temple Trees coup on the Election Day night, he said he had to launch a fast demanding an investigation into the allegation as the JVP did not intervene to expose the conspirators. He accused that the JVP leaders did not talk about the incident. ?I am not a youngster now, but I can teach politics to the lads? he claimed.
?JVP leaders have told that I have gone mad. I challenge them to tell it in public, so that I would be able to take legal action against them and use the damages they would pay for the building of my new party? Somawansa retorted.

PAFFREL to invite 50 ANFE observers for monitoring polls
	
A total of 50 observers representing the Asian Network for Free Elections (ANFE) would be invited to monitor the upcoming Parliamentary elections, People?s Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) said today.
Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi told the Daily Mirror that they were in the process of coordinating with the ANFE experts who had been monitoring local polls for years.
He said they had held two rounds of talks with the ANFE and they had agreed to arrive in Sri Lanka after necessary requirements were taken place including travelling facilities and accommodation.
?We are arranging the facilities and discussing on costs and it will finally invite the foreign observers by next week,? Mr. Hettiarachchi said.
He said the observers will be representing only South Asian and ASEAN countries. However, The Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya should also grant approval to PAFFREL?s proposal to invite a team of foreign observers.
The foreign observers are expected to visit several places in the island during the elections and monitor the polling process and the events during the post-polling period.
Speaking on 'March 12 Movement', he said their attempt had become a success since 100, 000 signatures had already been received by the several trade unions, academics and ordinary people.
According to him, the programme which began on 25 June, would travel across the country collecting about one million signatures to pressurise political parties to accept the criterion proposed for selecting candidates, while educating the general public about the criteria to be followed when electing MPs.
He said the programme was today held in Trincomalee and tommorrow (29) it would move towards Muttur and Batticaloa. (Piyumi Fonseka)
