Combative Trump declares media enemy of the people
	
OXON HILL AFP Feb24, 2017- US President Donald Trump rallied his loyal supporters with a stridently populist and security-dominated message Friday, declaring the start of a new political era of action. He was met by euphoric chants of USA, USA. Trump also renewed his evisceration of the fake media -- at length. 
They are the enemy of the people, because they have no sources. They just make em up when there are none, he said. 
With his Republican administration mired by multiple missteps and strong disapproval ratings, Trump tried to go on the offensive. 
He vowed to keep radical Islamic terrorists... the hell out of our country, again citing the examples of Sweden, Germany and France as places where immigration has led to crime, including the terror attacks in Paris and Nice. A combative Trump deployed tough rhetoric on immigrants, crime and the media, as he wooed once-skeptical conservatives at their annual meeting.

Kim Jong-Nam killed by VX nerve agent:  Malaysia police
	
North Korean leader Kim Jong-Uns half brother was assassinated with a lethal nerve agent manufactured for chemical warfare and listed by the UN as a weapon of mass destruction, Malaysian police said Friday. 
Releasing a preliminary toxicology report on Kim Jong-Nams murder at Kuala Lumpur airport, police revealed the poison used by the assassins was the odourless, tasteless and highly toxic VX. 
The news brought condemnation from South Korea, which slammed the use of the nerve agent as a blatant violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and other international norms. 
Experts in the South said Friday that North Korea has up to 5,000 tonnes of chemical weapons stockpiled, including a supply of VX. 
Kim died on February 13 after being attacked at Kuala Lumpur International Airport by two women, who are seen on CCTV footage shoving something in his face. 
He suffered a seizure and was dead before he reached hospital. 
An autopsy revealed traces of VX -- a fast-acting toxin that sparks respiratory collapse and heart failure -- on the dead mans face and in his eyes. 
Tiny amounts of the poison are enough to kill an adult. 
I am outraged that the criminals used such a dangerous chemical in a public area, said Environment Minister Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar It could have caused mass injuries or even death to other people. 
One of the two women arrested after the attack fell ill in custody, police said, adding she had been vomiting.

Mathews to miss Banga Tests
	
Angelo Mathews hamstring injury will keep him out of the forthcoming Test series against Bangladesh at home, as doctors who assessed him on Tuesday had advised further rest to heal the injury.
The Sri Lankan skipper was expected to be fit to lead the side against Bangladesh, having missed out the South African ODIs and the three-match T20 series against Australia, but the healing process seems to take more time than it was initially expected. Mathews sustained injury during his match winning knock in the second T20 against South Africa last month and immediately returned home to start the rehabilitation process.
Yes, I will be out of the Test series, Mathews said. The rehabilitation process is taking longer than expected.
The injury is bit more serious than what we thought. Theres a tendon tear as well which is delaying the recovery, he explained.
Mathews was initially advised four to five weeks of rest to recover completely but given his current situation, he is likely to miss the three match ODI series which will follow the two-Tests against Bangladesh.
Mathews also missed the Zimbabwe series, after he tore his calf during the fourth ODI against Australia in September last year, despite being named in the original squad for the tour.
In his absence, Rangana Herath, the 38-year-old veteran spinner is likely to lead the side as he did during the two-match series in Zimbabwe.
Sri Lanka is yet to name the squad for the series which will see the hosts playing two Tests, three ODIs and two T20 internationals against Bangladesh in March.(Champika Fernando)

Mother of two bans men from babysitting her kids child abuse by men is so common
	

An Australian mother of two has revealed she and her husband decided on a family rule after becoming parents - that no man would ever babysittheir children.

In an opinion piece for Daily Life, author Kasey Edwards said the ban extended to male friends and relatives and they had not wavered from it in eight years. 
Would I prefer to be a more chilled out parent Absolutely, she wrote. Will I change my family policy Unfortunately no. Child sexual abuse is so prevalent that I wont back down on my no-male-babysitters policy. Ms Edwards went on to clarify that she was not saying that all men are sexual predators and she does not think men harbour predatory instincts. 
But child abuse by men is so common that taking precautions to keep my daughters safe is a no-brainer, she wrote. 
Ms Edwards referenced an Australian Institute of Family Studies fact sheet titled Who Abuses Children. 
The purpose of the fact sheet is described online as being to provide an overview of the evidence available regarding those who abuse children. 
From the evidence available, it is clear that with the exception of child sexual abuse, children are most likely to be abused or neglected by parents and/or caregivers, it states. 
Research suggests that child sexual abuse is perpetrated by a wider group of people, including parents, other relatives, siblings, friends, or others known to the child (e.g., sports coach, teacher, priest)The fact sheet goes on to state: Evidence overwhelmingly indicates that the majority of child sexual abuse is perpetratedby males. 
Ms Edwards wrote that she and her husband did not want to investigate the character of every man they knew to asses whether or not they were potential sexual predators.My husband and my decision is based on straightforward risk analysis: a cold, hard, unemotional reading of the statistical data, she wrote. 
In 2014, Australian TV journalist Tracey Spicer made headlines when she wrote a piece saying she didnt want her kids sitting next to a man on a flight. 
I know its sexist. But I dont want my kids sitting next to a man on a plane, she wrote.In 2012 Sydney fireman, John McGirr, wrote an online blog post after being asked to move from an airline seat next to two boys - estimated to be between the ages of eight and 10 years old. 
Prior to take off, Mr McGirr was approached by a flight attendant, who asked him to move seats because the airlines policy at the time stated that men could not sit next to unaccompanied minors. 
The incident left me angry, embarrassed and acutely aware of how society has become fearful of everyone, Mr McGirr wrote. To the point that we are all presumed guilty and treated appropriately.

New law to standardize degrees from state, non-state unis
	
Amid the continuing controversy on the quality of higher education offered by private sector educational institutions, the Higher Education Ministry is to introduce legislation in Parliament to standardize the degree courses offered by State and non-State institutions, Minister Lakshman Kiriella said yesterday.
The Bill, if enacted, will also apply to the South Asia Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) which offers private medical education.
The minister told daily Mirror yesterday he would present the Quality Assurance Bill within the next two months and that Bill was being drafted with the assistance of the World Bank.
We are working out the finishing touches to the Bill. It is being drafted in consultation with the University Grants Commission and the Vice Chancellors of the State universities, he said.
There are numerous non-state degree awarding institutions operating in the country and the minister said as many as 50,000 students were studying for management degrees in the non-State sector.
Referring to SAITM, he said the students who graduated were prepared to sit for a licensing examination to be conducted by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC). (KB)

SLFPers keen on amendments not new constitution: Dilan
	
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) said yesterday the country needed only constitutional amendments but not a change of the Constitution.
Party Spokesman and State Minister Dilan Perera told Daily Mirror this was the opinion of a majority of SLFP members.
He said if the country opted for a change of the Constitution, it would not be able to introduce even amendments to the current constitution.
We will submit our proposals on those lines to the Steering Committee, he said.
He said a new Constitution could be introduced only with the approval of the people at a referendum. However, he said constitutional amendments could be introduced without a referendum. (Kelum Bandara)

Special corp. to handle development in South: PM
	
A special corporation will be set up to take care of development activities in the southern province and all lands will be handed over to it, Prime Minister Ranil Wixckremesinghe said yesterday.
He made these remarks at the opening of the United National Party office in Akmeemana last evening.
"There was a southern region development authority in the past.However it was dissolved later. We would have handed over these lands to this authority if it existed today," he said.
The prime minister said the first 100 factories in the south will be opened by the Chinese investors. He said local investors will be given the opportunity later.
"I met some local investors the other day. I asked them whether they could see to it they provide necessary investments needed for the country's development and they said they cannot. Therefore it is obvious that we need foreign investors. We will have to increase taxes if we don't allow foreign investors," he said.
Mr Wickremesinghe.said the joint opposition is trying to sabotage the development as they are aware they will be in a disadvantageous position if the government's development programme becomes a success. He said the joint opposition is trying to distance the UNP and the president but he assured that it is a distant dream as he and President Sirisena had already agreed to continue with the national government till 2020.

The doyen of Jpura University Management Faculty
	


It is hard to believe that a year has lapsed since the demise of our distinguished colleague Gajaba Gunawardana who passed away on February 22, 2016.
Gajaba was born in Weligama, a coastal village in the deep South. His father Turin Perera Gunawardana was a renowned Ayurvedic doctor who later moved to Polhena in Matara to educate his children. He was the fifth in a family with two brothers and three sisters.
Gajaba received his education at leading Catholic school St. Servatius College in Matara.
Notwithstanding his busy commitments in Colombo, he did not hesitate to render his cardinal obligations to his alma mater by being the Vice President of St. Servatius, Colombo Branch.
It was at Sri Jayawardanepura University that I had the privilege of interacting with Gajaba intimately since 1971. He enrolled for the four year B.Sc (Special) in Public Administration Degree Programme and his affable ways and gentle conduct endeared him to all batch mates. He obtained his M.A. in Management Learning at University of Lancaster, UK. As an undergraduate, Gajaba seemed to have been more struggle-oriented than academically-bent.
This popularity eventually led him to contest successfully for the Student Council dominated by the Communist party along with a team of student council leaders who have later become prominent politicians like S.B. Dissanayake, Bandula Gunawardana, Reginald Cooray, Chandrasiri Gajadeera and Mahinda Wijesekera.
The majority of the Student Council leaders during this era had been very aggressive in their approach when dealing with student grievances. SB, Yasaratna and Iddamalgoda were his roommates and the strategic plans they engineered, burning the midnight oil at the Soratha Hall, paid rich dividends in developing the Management Faculty.
Bandula Gunawardene in his funeral eulogy distinctly recalled that his generation of politicians was eternally indebted to Gajaba for his forthright stand on principle whenever the universities and the students faced numerous challenges. But he never sought political favours for personal gain. That was Gajaba.
Gajabas mastery of the English language stood him in good stead. Whenever representatives of the World University Service and other foreign dignitaries came to address the students, obviously the task of translation fell upon Gajaba who quite lucidly imparted such addresses. His proficiency in English language was manna from heaven and his compelling arguments at the bargaining table with the university administration often brought tangible results. He always relied on the fact that when intricate issues were emotionally-driven, it was impossible to find rational solutions.
It would be a gross injustice to Gajaba if an unforgettable deed of patriotism on his part is not mentioned. Being the Director of the Road Sector Assistance Project that was funded by the World Bank, Gajaba was on an official trip to Ampara when he was stopped by the sentries of an Army checkpoint at Mahaoya on the stretch of the main road running from Mahaoya to Ampara.
This was the very road where the massacre of 33 Buddhist monks, most of them young, and four civilians by the rebel LTTE cadres took place on June 2, 1987 in Aranthalawa. The sentries politely pointed the imminent danger, also in the vehicle prominently displaying the national flag.
Gajaba insisted on proceeding for the meeting and was even prepared to give a written undertaking on his own volition taking the full responsibility for his life. After much persuasion, he was allowed to go on the request of removing the national flag only for this stretch for his own safety. His stock answer was that even if he died at the hands of the militants, he was not prepared to remove the national flag. Gajaba being Gajaba, did not comply with this the admonishment and simply proceeded, taking a huge risk. Unbelievably, no untoward incident happened. That was the sense of patriotism he had for Mother Lanka.
He had a very successful career in the public sector and leading funding and service organisations spanning over 35 years of service. His assignments at the Ports and Highways Ministry as World Bank Projects Director, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry as Fisheries Sector Development Project Director, National Institute of Business Management as a Management Consultant, Sri Lanka Foundation Institute as a Senior Lecturer and World University Service, Geneva, Switzerland as the Regional Administration Officer (Asia and the Pacific Region) are some of the key posts he held with distinction.
His posting at the Ports and Highways Ministry as Director in-charge of World Bank Projects involving rehabilitation and improvement of 15 national roads with a total length of 635 Kilometres ($ 263 million) was one of the formidable tasks he executed quite exceptionally. At a time when the road development sector was criticised for corruption and bribery, his achievement as the lowest recorded cost per kilometre in spite of the recorded rate of inflation was an appreciable performance.
Gajabas last assignment was at the Colombo Port Development Project as a Consultant. Gajaba called over at my office when the writer was the Acting Chairman of theMarine Environmental Protection Authority (MEPA), in order to ascertain the key marine environmental safeguards. He was absolutely unaware of my presence as the head of this institution until he stepped into my office. He pretended that he knew me, by giving me the due respect as Sir during the entire discussion. A remarkable quality in his approach was he never sought undue favours from me, nor did he indicate our personal relationship in the course of the subsequent dealings with my officers or his colleagues.
Gajaba was one of the prime movers for the establishment of the local branch of the World University Service (WUS). He represented Sri Lanka at the Youth and Development in an Asian setting held in Kathmandu, Nepal and the WUS International General Assembly in Managua, Nicaragua.
He instinctively followed his conscience in everything he did, and his conscience never let him down. It was a pleasure to meet him and be greeted by his radiant smile and warm mellifluous voice. Gajaba was a down to earth, pragmatic sober scholar produced by the Management Faculty of Sri Jayawardana University.
His wife Indrani, a former Director of the Agriculture and Livestock Ministry (Special Projects) and daughter Harini were a tower of strength to Gajaba right throughout his life. His sister Thalatha was a live-wire in the family circle who consoled Gajaba at every moment of his life when he was distressed.
Now that an Alumni Association has been formally established in the Faculty of Management Studies and Commerce, it is fervently hoped that adequate space be provided in its website for the publication of the articles and eulogies of this nature.
Memories of this amiable and dignified character shall remain in the hearts of his friends and colleagues for many years to come. May you attain the supreme bliss of Nirvana.

The future of war is ROBOTS
	

Increased automation in the workforce has caused many to fear their jobs will soon be taken over by robots  and, experts now warn even the military will be affected by the shift. 
The use of robots could help the US military to cut costs and would allow them to remove soldiers from potentially dangerous environments, the San Diego
Union-Tribune reports. 
Experts say the move has already begun in many ways, with newer warships like the USS Zumwalt designed to be manned by half the crew of previous destroyers, and Navy researchers experimenting with ghost fleets of underwater drones.As driverless cars hold potential to take over taxi and truck driver jobs, a similar scenario could play out in the military to
support troops. 
Robots could take on a number of tasks, from managing and delivering supplies or analyzing thousands of legal documents, to quickly diagnosing diseases and assisting in the operating room, the San Diego Union-Tribune reports. 
Just as in the civilian economy, automation will likely have a big impact on military organizations in logistics and manufacturing, Michael Horowitz, a University of Pennsylvania professor and an expert on weaponized robots told the San Diego Union-Tribune. 
The US military is very likely to pursue forms of automation that reduce back-office costs over time, as well as remove soldiers from non-combat deployments where they might face risk from adversaries on fluid battlefields, such as in transportation. 
Robots could also be used to detect and dismantle mines.

Will you lose your job to robots
A White House report published in December warned millions of American may lose their jobs to AI. 
Less-skilled and less-educated workers will be affected the most. 
The technology may also increase wealth inequality. 
However, AI will improve the countrys productivity growth, which would result in higher wages and fewer work hours. 
New jobs will also be created for those who were replaced for robots. 
Humans will still be needed to engage with consumers, develop AI and supervise tasks and the technology.

US wife refuses to give up on her Elephant man husband
	

A woman married to a sufferer of the fatal elephant man condition says the disease doesnt scare her. 
Angie Richards, 34, first met Brian, 33, whose bones and organs wont stop growing, on an online dating website seven years ago. 
He has Proteus syndrome, an ultra-rare condition made famous by Joseph Merrick who inspired the film The Elephant Man. 
But she was never put off by his deformities - despite knowing he was only expected to live until he was 18. Now they are approaching their fourth wedding anniversary, but they are aware he could die at any time. 
Ms Richards, from Dover in Delaware, US, said: From his dating profile picture, I could tell he had something wrong but didnt know what it was, nor did I care; disease and handicap,
doesnt scare me. 
Having a condition was not enough for me to think of Brian as a no. 
I grew up in an environment where you dont care about what a person looks like, you care about who they are and how they treat others.Brian is very caring, loving man, early on in our relationship he drove three hours for my daughters birthday and even made her a woodwork penguin toy - which is her favourite animal. 
The food inspector added: He cant change his condition and didnt choose it to happen, it was just luck of the draw. 
People asking questions never bothers me, but I have to bite my tongue when they point or whisper.As he grows older, things continue to change and he is gradually getting worse. Despite all of this is, he always has a smile on his face and is always optimistic, he never complains. 
With only 120 documented cases, Mr Richards condition led to cruel bullying and all prospective dates were scared off.Before meeting his wife online in 2010, he doubted he would ever find love. 
He added: When people meet me they normally like me for who I am, but dont like how I look. 
But with Angie, she cares about the beauty inside not whats on the outside.

Wearing protective helmets made mandatory
	
Transport and Civil Aviation Minsiter Nimal Siripla De Silva yesterday issued a gazette notice making it mandatory all motorcyclists including pillion riders to wear a protective helmet which does not conceal any part of the wearer's face.
According to the new regulations the helmet should fit the wearers head and secured with a chin strap. The helmet would be fitted with a visor not made of a tinted or coloured material with the face exposed and unobstructed peripheral vision.

The protective helmet and chin strap shall be one single unit without any sharp edges, sharp points, joints or bolts around it, the gazette notification said.
"The colour of the protective helmet shall be 90 per cent of a single colour that is easily visible without any light reflecting from its outer surface. Every protective helmet worn by a person who rides motorcycle shall conform to Sri Lanka Standard 517 of 1994 or such standards that may be applicable for protective helmets from time to time. The ministry said no person shall use or sell or offer for sale any helmet that does not conform to the provisions of these regulations for the purpose of riding a motorcycle on any road except for riding a motorcycle at a motorcycle race."
