?A FIREFLY LAID TO REST?
	
He led ?The Fireflies? band in Ceylon from 1963, a personal friend of mine, Milroy de Silva has passed away in Vancouver, Canada, after a long illness, leaving family, friends and fans, deeply saddened by his death, at the age of 84. Milroy was indeed a superb guitarist, self-taught, as most of us were in the good old days.??
I remember the time when he lived down Davidson Road, Bambalapitiya, practically right behind our little tenement home in Lorensz Road, and this is where I first heard a ?special-style? of acoustic guitar playing which left me spell-bound with the skill and expertise he displayed. A ?Latin-rhythm strum? that was as individualistic as the man himself, to be quite honest about it, I have never seen a ?strum? like it. In addition, Milroy was a superb ?lead-guitarist? as well. At the time, during the early 50?s, Arthur ?Guitar-Bogey? Smith played ?Guitar-Bogey? just as well as Milroy de Silva. Note for note/chord for chord, there was no difference whatsoever. I would go to Milroy?s , sit there with him, watching those hands, playing his music, in absolute fascination. It was all acoustic ?stuff? then. Electric guitars would be imported by ?Harmonics? and Papa Menezes later, but Milroy and ?yours truly? decided to manufacture our own amplifier in order to increase the sound of his ?acoustic?.? ?
We managed to find a couple of old ?pakis-petti? [wooden boxes], Milroy used his electronic ability, he had two old ?speakers? from an ancient radio-gram and together, we produced the very first, not-too-handsome-looking ?amplifier? that Lorensz Road had seen. Milroy then took his acoustic guitar to Papa Menezes and Papa, always wanting to help people, put in the ?finishing touch? to Milroy?s old acoustic, turning it into what was possibly the first electric/acoustic in Bambalapitiya. Milroy loved that guitar and not too much later his number one ?fan? was going to use this same treasured instrument, to join a Circus Group that would be touring the Country for Donavan Andree. There used to be a famous ?girls? school? named after some bloke by the exalted name of ?Lindsay?. This was a Christian School where the ?Head-Mistress? suddenly decided to run a Thursday afternoon ?special? programme called the ?Band of Hope? which would consist of around two hours of ?Religious-Teachings? to the girl-students, some of whom had no hope at all, but were welcome there anyway. After the Band of Hope, the girls would be permitted to encourage any talented entertainers they knew to entertain them with music before they left for the evening to go home.?
There were several pianists, piano accordion, and even a ?mouth-organist? or two, known to various lasses at this School, to provide the said entertainment. Now and then, there would be a ?vacant? Thursday afternoon, but Milroy de Silva and Desmond Kelly needed no encouragement to fill the vacancy. Milroy, with his guitar and Desmond with his Ukulele would happily go down there, sing to, and entertain the girls, who, like any normal females of the time enjoyed being entertained. We had nearly all of the Lindsay Girls? School lasses around us for the afternoon requesting their favourite songs and Milroy and Desmond enjoyed the attention they were getting, but had to sneak ?out?, over the rear wall of the School, guitar, uke, and all to escape some of the boy-friends of some girls, waiting impatiently outside the front gate, to give these two imposters an unmerciful thrashing for taking up ?their girls? time?.? ?
Milroy de Silva and Desmond Kelly were always very good friends. Then in 1952, Desmond Kelly was afforded the chance of joining this English Circus group to tour Ceylon with them. He had to audition for them before he got the job. However, the Circus Owner needed a guitar-playing singer on-stage, so what to do, men?, Desmond Kelly then borrowed that same old guitar from Melroy, for the weekend, taught himself to play the two extra ?strings? involved, passed the audition and got the job. Milroy carried on in Colombo. He was already a very popular entertainer and found himself working, in the showbiz- industry regularly. There was hardly a large hotel or nightclub in Ceylon at the time, that we didn?t work for.??
Unfortunately, I lost touch with him after our Circus show named The Continental Non-stop Revue ended, I joined the Royal Ceylon Navy, getting out in 1962 to migrate to Melbourne.??
In the meantime, Milroy, still doing what he loved, formed his own band and called them his ?Fire-flies?. He was indeed a superb musician, still, someone to whom many upcoming musicians went to, for advice, freely given. He was also an ardent fan of the old Country & Western icon Montana Slim, singing and playing in the old style to the delight of hundreds of fans, wherever he performed.? ?
He eventually left ?Our Lovely Island Home?, like so many of us, to settle in Vancouver Canada. Here he was affectionately known as ?Guitar John?, entertained, as we music-lovers do, until it becomes physically impossible to do so, and has finally ?passed on? to continue singing and playing his guitar for the angels in heaven. A ?personal? apology from me to you, Milroy, is that, although I did my very best to keep in touch with you, latterly, it became impossible to telephone you because you were frequently unavailable, in hospital, or just not home. No excuses on my part, but after coming to Australia, trying to do two and even three jobs at a time, working ?shifts, 24/7, although I would have loved to have come to Canada, just to join your band and play the music we both loved, it was only wishful thinking on my part. Rest easy now, my friend. We had some great times together but now let me ask God to bless you and keep you, my sincere condolences to your entire family and this, my dedication to you, Milroy de Silva will show you that ?Music and Memories? always go hand in hand.??
Your pal, always,?Desmond Kelly??

A great loss to peace and reconciliation
	
The remains of Most. Ven. Prof. Bellanwila Wimalarathana Anunayake Thera
One of the most prominent saffron-clad Sri Lankan emissaries, Most Ven. Prof. Bellanwila Wimalaratana Nayake Thera, who brightened the seat of monkhood, socio-religious harmony and reconciliation in our times, having championed the crusade against stinking politics and its hegemonic impact on us, is no more.
?
His sudden demise at a time his critical guidance is most needed to rid our body politics of its pollutants came as a scathing blow to all moderate and right-thinking segments of our society on the eve of our 70th Independence day, particularly after the passing-away of his university colleague, Most Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhitha Nayake Thera, who had left an indelible mark among all of us. Memories of Ven. Wimalaratana Thera, no doubt would continue to linger in our minds for the rest of our lives. This is because he was not only affiliated with the Sangha fraternity, but also with the laity (Dayakayas) who venerated him as an outspoken monk in our country. In one sense, he remained a strong supporter of social justice and reforms. He was also an author of many books, a role model for his Kotte Sangha Sabha members, an erudite scholar at academic levels, a straight forward voice for the voiceless and the most distinguished monk in the province he lived in.? ?
Born in Bellanwila 76 years ago on a noteworthy day (14 April), he belonged to a well-known family lineage of ?Omaththage? in the area in a family of several brothers. It was the then incumbent, Most Ven. Bellanwila Sri Somaratana Nayake Thera-highly respected as the pioneer of contemporary revival of the ancient Bellanwila Raja Maha Viharaya- who ordained our protagonist in focus the late Ven. Wimalaratana Thera as Ven Somaratana?s novice monks (samanera). These monks followed the basic Dhamma education at the Vidyalankara Pirivena and later took up university education.? ?
Socialist politics?
A fact that remained very distinct in his varsity days was his close association with the then socialist-leftist doctrine of the Philip Gunewardene?s era, et al. He also, it is said, was instrumental in organizing student protests inside the campus against different issues as young revolutionary monks of the times, an experience that would have perhaps carried him forward into his subsequent firebrand types of protests as he matured later on to be a full-pledged scholar and a social reformer. Upon the demise of his Guru, Ven Somaratana Thero in 1984, he was compelled to take the reins as the Viharadhikari in this huge place of worship since Ven. Dhammaratana Thera, his own elder brother, had by then migrated to Singapore on missionary work. The Bellanwila temple was his forte afterwards.
After receipt of his Doctorate (PhD) from the University of Lancaster in UK and his return, he was invited to the University of Sri Jayawardenapura for academic teaching. There, he rose to be the Dean of the Faculty of Buddhist and Pali Studies until his subsequent pre-retirement due to ever-increasing workload in the temple. He might be one of the most rare personages who had gradually reached the apex of office as the Chancellor in the very university where he served as a lecturer.? ?
Late Wimalaratana Thera as a scholar took to writing at first to university journals, magazines, newspapers, etc before he penned his own books of academic research and value. ? Buddhism & other Religions?, ?Evolution of Making Buddha Statues?, ?Viharalipi Saraniya?, ?Paramitha Sarana?, are among some of the most popular ones he authored. His Sinhala translation of the ?Unshaken Mind? (Noselena Manasa ) was serialized in national newspapers and it grabbed the attention of many an intellectual and readers.?There is nothing amusing, like writing or authoring a book for me since it is my simple hobby. It is actually what I enjoy most as I grow older and older,? he once plainly quipped to this writer during an interactive meet at the temple many moons ago. He was so close to our hearts and just a few days before his untimely death, he was found giving final touches to his latest research book on a new theme.? ?
Vibrant social reformer?
The tripartite combination of Ven. Iththepane Dhammalankara Nayake Thera, Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera and Ven. Wimalaratana Thera did not take long to emerge as dedicated guardians of the common-folk as the political scenario after 1995 changed, apparently shifting towards a policy of appeasing separatists who were fighting for division of the country. The trio stood their ground firm, unmoved and opposed vehemently to those moves as it would be disastrous to the country, if any division were to take place as planned by some political authorities of the times. All appeals fell on deaf ears and finally street protests led by the trio, began to swell and rotated round the Parliament roundabout near Diyawannawa, flanked by thousands of protesting monks and patriotic civilians. Their leadership compelled the then Government to shelve that plan of action and changed their discourse. Needless to highlight, Ven.
Wimalaratana Thera who had the gift of the gab and the ability to convey the repercussions of any such ill-conceived political move won the day. For him, any assembly of pre-determined decision-makers was only a public platform where diverse opinions were aired. Hence, the late Thera was always invited to speak, may it be a meeting of monks, politicians or otherwise since he had the distinguished quality of addressing the concerns of the full picture of the issue at hand. He was admired and respected for such forthrightness and honesty. The Ven. Thera received much respect for this attitude from all quarters of non-buddhist dignitaries as well.? ?
Fearless Ven. Wimalaratana Thera never stood for communal politics nor got onto any such stage during his illustrious life, full of spirits. Nor did he play hosannas to anyone how much mighty he would be since he did not expect any personal favours from any person.? ?
Stance on religious amity?
Another outstanding feature in him was his very close association with religious chiefs of all denominations through the Congress of Religions which he co-chaired until his demise. He fully believed in reconciliation, co-existence and ethnic harmony and always distanced himself from passions of communal hatred and extreme ideologies, harboured by some of his own community, Maha Sangha and others. Though he at times was subjected to criticisms, he stuck to his guns and challenged his dissidents to prove otherwise, if possible. The presence of Rev Oswald Gomis, Bishop, Rev Kenneth Fernando, Kurukkal and Moulavis in the temple premises soon after the news of his unfortunate death took to wings, proved this touch amply.?
That was a fitting tribute to his celebrated name, Ven. Wimalaratana Thera unbowed in the presence of any mighty person, but was a friend of all strata of society.??
?
He always disassociated himself with those extremists, whether they were politically backed or otherwise. He asserted that unless people of all ethnicities work together, we would never be able to take this country forward. With his death, there falls a huge vacuum among us to find any future replacement as such.? ?
Social service projects?
Perhaps only a limited number of Sri Lankans are aware that the Bellanwila Raja Maha Vihara has been at the forefront of launching many a diverse welfare projects. A symbolic charge of Rs 20 from each vehicle parking in the yard there, has so far rescued the lives of many patients. As a much as Rs 100 lakhs were collected for this purpose during the past two years. More than a hundred such appeals still reach the temple in search of financial help for medicine or surgery, a unique humanitarian project of exemplary nature. So, is the Community Development Centre at Bellanwila, managed by the temple in order to provide vocational training to school dropouts. It was one of such pioneering institutes in the country even before state patronage for this sphere came in to this effect. Our late Ven. Wimalaratana Thera had a great network of philanthropists and well-wishers who would always stand by him either during such projects or the organizing of the Perahera or any other event in the temple.? ?
It is also pertinent to mention here that Ven. Dhammaratana Nayake Thera in his capacity as the religious advisor at the Buddhist Library in Singapore always assisted Ven. Wimalaratana Thera by way of providing much-needed raw materials to such projects. Likewise, the conduct of Sunday school, Elders? daycare centre, Pilgrims? rest, welfare shops, etc are all patronized by our late Thera, despite heavy expenditure being incurred. Another feature that impressed many was his ability to maintain undisturbed administration of such projects in a relaxed mood, although at times he was critical. Only a few perhaps know that he was a cricket fan and never wanted to miss a match, regardless of whether he was either here or abroad. He also possessed a deep knowledge of reputed cricketers and interacted with them whenever time permitted.. His passion for music and aestheticism was no less and saw no bounds. He always wanted to assist musicians in whatever way possible. One of the most felicitation ceremonies he attended was that of Mrs Sujatha Attanayake at Sri Lanka Foundation Institute, about which he later expressed his opinion with this writer in person at the temple. He was so attached to artistes and film producers that he offered all possible assistance to everyone who came to our protagonist.? ?
Bellanwila and temple?
Had late Somaratana Thera been considered the pioneer of the modern revival, it was none other than late Wimalaratana Thera who carried the name of Bellanwila to international fame and left a niche for itself in overseas chronicles. He widely travelled and won a recognition for himself as a preacher or an intellectual of Buddhist knowledge. At times, he enjoyed very much cracking jokes with whom he felt desirable to do so. And he was the tower of strength behind the annual Esala Perahera spectacle after the demise of Most Ven. Sri Somaratana Thera. He used to spend a fortnight of sleepless nights during the Perahera season, but ensured everything worked well until the Diyakapana ceremony. He was so close to this writer in many fronts, although our Thera seldom had enough free time to relax. His affinity with us in the village was a strong catalyst and he made the day so interesting whenever we all travel outside Colombo once a year to attend the commemorative alms-giving of our Nayake Thera. But this year, brought a devastating blow which came with his demise. May his cycle of Sansara be short and let him be reborn among us during this procession of Paramithas. May you attain supreme bliss of Nirvana !? ?
The funeral of late prelate Ven. Prof. Bellanwila Wimalarathana Thera, will be held today at the Sri Jayewardenepura University grounds.? ?

Attempt to alienate Udawattakele land
	
Officials of the Forest Conservation Department are perturbed by the decision of a senior forest conservator to alienate a 90 perch block of land of the Udawattakele forest reserve to a leading hotel in Kandy.
The officials said the officer concerned had instructed the Divisional Secretary, Kandy Four Gravets and Gangawata Korala to proceed with the required documentation to release the block of land based on a 12-year-old cabinet decision of a previous government.
A top Cabinet Minster in the Government has shares in the hotel.
They said that the relevant gazette notification to alienate the block of land was now being drafted and that the official responsible for this land grab might have provided misinformation to the President and Environment Minister.
Forest Department officials said the senior officials of the department were planning to alienate 90perches of the Udawatta forest reserve to the businessman concerned to expand a leading tourist hotel in Kandy and that the hotel company was already occupying the land illegally.
?The Range Forest Conservator had filed action against them in the Kandy Magistrate?s Court on the charge of causing a damage of Rs.73, 885,000 to the forest reserve. In 2005 the then Tourism Minister Anura Bandaranaike submitted a cabinet paper to alienate the land to the hotel company in exchange of a block of land in another location belonging to the company. However, it was foiled by the provincial forest conservation officials and other organizations that protested against the move. It is in doubt that the court case might have been brushed under the carpet due to political interference.
The Udawattakele forest reserve which had been used as a royal park during the reign of the Kandyan kings was declared a forest reserve by the British by an extra ordinary gazette notification under the Forest Conservation Ordinance. The value of the land which is rich in bio-diversity would run into billions of rupees. However the Forest Conservator (Planning and Progress Control) has taken steps to alienate the land and instructed the Divisional Secretary to release it from the forest reserve.
Forest Conservation Officials said that the Forest Conservation Ordinance does not provide for the proposed exchange of land from the forest reserve for one belonging to the hotel company and that it would create a bad precedent creating serious consequences. They are surprised how a cabinet approval that had been laid by successive governments for 12 years could be implemented without the knowledge of the present cabinet. (Ajithlal Shanthaudaya)

## Title: Auditor General shows mismatch in loans and assets

Auditor General shows mismatch in loans and assets
	
Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe said according to the latest financial declarations, the country?s foreign and domestic loan account stood at Rs. 8.9 trillion by the end of 2016, but the audited domestic assets stood at only Rs.1.1 trillion.
He said that the main reason for this was the failure to utilise loans properly and in the estimated manner for projects.
Addressing the media yesterday, Mr Wijesinghe charged that auditing and maintaining a correct balance sheet at almost all development projects launched with foreign loans, Ministries, Departments and Semi-Government ventures has caused problems to the state auditing system.
?The main reason for this situation in the public finance was the all-powerful chief Auditing Officer of the Treasury during the previous Government overseeing the budget, monetary policy and administration,? he said.
Explaining that trillions of public funds were not found in the books or audit reports, Mr Wijesinghe said there were public funds allocated to Provincial Councils and Semi-Government ventures that were not found in books.
?A bigger portion of loans obtained for major development projects from foreign banks and global financial agencies for higher interest rates of 5% have been diverted for non-productive purposes and recurrent expenditure.
?Though there was a policy decision that foreign loans obtained must not exceed 80% of the GDP, this rule had not been followed and loans have been taken excessively. When the capital raised from loans for the development project is used for other objectives, with no dividends or for people, debt-servicing comes cumbersome and a liability on the Treasury.
?It also makes loan repayment unmanageable, which has exactly happened at the moment,? Mr Wijesinghe pointed out.
Mr Wijesinghe said the nom de guerre ?Economic Assassin? used to identify him was quite appropriate, when taken into account the harm he has done to the country?s economy.
?The Uma ? Oya multi-purpose development project, D.A Rajapaksa Memorial Centre, unauthorised rice imports, construction of Suriyawewa Cricket Stadium are some of the projects that had been launched using foreign loans but with no dividends,? he said.
?There has been no proper Feasibility Study or Environment Impact Assessment for Uma Oya Project, D.A. Rajapaksa memorial has been constructed by the Land Reclamation and Development Corporation without a plan and funds, Suriyawewa International Cricket Stadium has also been constructed with excessive funds than the estimated investment. These projects are only the tip of the iceberg. There are more failed investment projects launched using foreign commercial loans that have further exacerbated the debt servicing, Mr Wijesinghe emphasised.
?Responding to a journalist, Mr. Wijesinghe said if the proposed ?National Audit Act? had been in the statute book in 2015, the bond scandal would not have happened because the new piece of legislation gives more power to the Auditor General?s Department and Ministry Secretaries, who are the chief accounting officers of Ministries.
?The main culprits to the current sad situation in public finance are the Secretaries of the Ministries. Many of them are working for the Minister and without hesitation carry out irregular orders of the Minister. The best example is the Sil Redi case,? he said.
Mr Wijesinghe in a lighter vein said Ministry Secretaries must not get frightened to work at the Treasury (Siberia) as a punishment for refusing to carry out an illegal order of a Minister as they get paid their salary for doing nothing.
?You can read Pansiya Panas Jathakaya as you are not unoccupied. It is better than obeying to do dishonest or illegal job ordered by a Minister,? he said.
Commenting on the long delay in passing the ?National Audit Bill? in Parliament, Mr Wijesinghe said the main obstacle to enact the Audit Bill was Ministry Secretaries or Chief Accounting Officers.
?They are frightened that their power and influence would be drastically diminished if the National Audit Bill was enacted. But we are determined to enact this Bill this month as it will bring remedies for many ills in the economy and public finance," Mr Wijesinghe stressed. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Don?t lose what you achieved in 2015-PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who wound up the UNP campaign for the local government election in Maradana last evening urged the people not to lose what they achieved in January 2015. He also told the UNPers to get ready to form a government in 2020.
?If you want us to form the government in 2020 you will have to go and vote on Saturday. Don't lose what you achieved in January 2015. If you vote for us on Saturday we will be able to form a UNP government in 2020 and work towards securing power in 2025 as well,? he said.
The Prime Minister requested the people vote wisely on Saturday and to make sure the polling was free and fair. ?This year?s local government poll campaign has been free and fair. There have been no reports of lives lost, arrests and instances of public property being misused thus far. Even I was not allowed to attend any openings,? he said, pointing out that the elections commission has become more powerful than the President and the Prime Minister.
Additionally, he said no journalists were killed or attacked while there are no incidents of burning media establishments today although the government is criticized. ?Don?t allow this freedom to be taken from you and use your vote intelligently,? he told the people. The Prime Minister also pledged to bring about financial stability in the country. He said the economy was on the way to recovery.
Mr. Wickremesinghe ended by reminding those present about something he had been stressing on right throughout the polls campaign and that was to be sure to ensure that the local government bodies and the central government is run by the same party from now on.
UNP Mayoral candidate for the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) Rosy Senanayake said President Maithripala Sirisena should not forget the final rally that was held during the Presidential Election campaign."It was Prime Minister Wickremesinghe who went and brought Mr. Sirisena forward when he was still at home after his bodyguards were taken from him," Ms. Senanayake said.
UNP MP Mujibur Rahaman expressed the same sentiment while adding that UNPers should get ready to form a new government in 2020 when the term of the incumbent ends. ?The President may not be aware that the mayoral candidate fielded by his party is also facing corruption charges,? he said.

Female genital mutilation not acceptable: UN
	
Female genital mutilation was not acceptable in the 21st century, said Jayathma Wickramanayake, the United Nations Secretary-General?s Envoy on Youth, speaking at an international forum in Gambia on strategies to combat the practice.
She said it was not acceptable and this was done in the name of tradition, culture, and religion or in the name of ensuring that women were to take on subservient roles to men they will eventually marry.
?This is not acceptable in the 21st century,? she added.
She said globally, over 200 million women and girls were estimated to have undergone some form of genital mutilation and girls aged 14 and younger account for about 44 million of those who had been ?cut.?
?According to the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), although the practice is declining in many countries where it is prevalent, many of these countries also experiencing a high rate of population growth ? meaning that the number of girls who undergo genital mutilation will continue to grow if efforts are not significantly scaled up,? she added.
She said in one of its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development ? agreed to by all UN Member States ? had called for eliminating female genital mutilation as well as other harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and countries too had also stepped up their efforts.
?History has taught us that human societies can come up with reprehensible social practices ? that are justified under false guises ? to strengthen the power structures or maintain the status quo for certain groups in society,? she said.
?Luckily we also know that social practice is not static and that it can change as our understanding evolves,? she said.

The earliest evidence relating to the existence of this animal dating back to the Pliocene and Pleistocene Epochs suggests that the pangolin has survived for a very long time. Researchers have found pangolin fossil from rocks during these periods in Cape Province, Africa. But as at today they are walking faster towards extinction. These scaly, toothless anteaters have become the world?s most trafficked species in a way that all of its eight species have been categorised as either ?vulnerable?, ?endangered? or ?critically endangered?. World Pangolin Day falls on February 17, but the rate at which they are being trafficked across borders is quite alarming! Although pangolins have been included in the Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) prohibiting the trade of any of its parts or derivatives across borders, China and Vietnam seems to be getting a larger supply of the species from all over the world.??
From 2011 through October 2013 the number of illegally trafficked pangolins lies between 100,000 and 210,000.
The widespread extinction of pangolins was mentioned on the Traffic Bulletin?(April 2016, Volume 28)
In Sri Lanka, although the pangolin population is still unknown, the animal is being hunted for meat, by both locals as well as the Chinese. A
growing trend also shows that its scales are being smuggled to China. With the sudden increase in Chinese nationals in the country, earlier the street dog population in areas such as Hambantota started to dwindle and now, the pangolins. Quite interestingly, Sri Lanka is set to be one of the hosts of the CITES meeting to be held in 2019 and she would record a big win if authorities contribute in protecting the rest of the pangolins and put a stop to the illegal international trade, currently increasing in the country.? ?
Hence, the Daily Mirror sheds light on the law which protects pangolins from being harmed or smuggled and the importance of conserving them.? ?
Indian Pangolin? ??
Locally known as the ?kaballawa?, the Indian Pangolin (Manis crassicaudata), is a primarily nocturnal animal easily recognized by its full armour of scales. A nationally protected species under the Flora and Fauna Protection Ordinance (FFPO) only one of its eight species is found in Sri Lanka. As they live on a specialized diet of ants and termites, they often die in captivity as they are elusive and slow to breed. The eight species of pangolin contribute to a wide degree of activity. Some species prefer to be nocturnal, sleeping in a curled ball during the day. Others such as the long-tailed pangolin are more active during the day time, using their sharpened sense of smell to locate insects.? ?
All eight species of pangolins have been listed in the Appendix 1 of the Convention on International Trades in Endangered Species (CITES) giving it the highest levels of protection from commercial trade. All eight species are also classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as threatened with extinction while two of the species closest to the problem are classified as critically endangered.? ?
Each animal?could cost up to?$ 1000 in restaurants
Illegal international trade?
Pangolins have become the most frequently seized mammal in Asia?s illegal wildlife trade, as smugglers sell the creatures to meet culinary and medicinal demands. Pangolin meat is known to be a delicacy in China and Vietnam and according to sources, in Southern China, each animal could cost up to $ 1000 in restaurants. But most of their worth comes from their scales which are used in Chinese medicine to cure illnesses from asthma to reproductive problems and even cancer. In addition to that, pangolin fetuses and blood too are used in medicine while stuffed pangolins are sold as souvenirs. As such they are killed, skinned and frozen before being traded on the black market.? ?
The widespread extinction of pangolins was mentioned on the Traffic Bulletin (April 2016, Volume 28) ? a publication affiliated with institutional partners such as the World Wildlife Fund, IUCN and the CITES. Its special feature highlighted that African pangolins are now being smuggled to meet the demand in countries such as China and Vietnam. From 2011 through October 2013 the number of illegally trafficked pangolins lies between 100,000 and 210,000.? ?
?
Restaurant manager imprisoned? ?
When contacted, the OIC of the Kollupitiya Police Priyadarshana De Silva said that in the wake of this incident the manager of the restaurant was imposed a penalty of Rs. one lakh. ?Under the Animal Cruelty Ordinance he will undergo rigorous imprisonment for three months suspended for five years. This is the first time we came across a case like this, but our teams have commenced investigations to find whether there are more cruel practices of this nature.?? ?
?
?We need?to be vigilant??-Gunawardena?
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, environmental lawyer Jagath Gunawardena said that the pangolin is a strictly protected species. ?Under Section 30 sub section 2 of the Flora and Fauna Protection Ordinance (FFPO) any person who kills, harms or keeps parts of pangolins can be arrested without a warrant. It?s a non-bailable offence. We rarely see these animals and therefore the exact count of their population is unknown. Pangolin scales have an international market and unfortunately it has reached Sri Lanka as well. Since 2015 there have been reported cases where scales were smuggled out of Sri Lanka. In addition to that, the export of any part of a pangolin is prohibited under Section 40 of the FFPO. China and Middle Eastern countries are known for this trade and as such we need to be vigilant since there?s already an influx of Chinese in the country. There are newer dimensions where people are interested in tasting curious meats and the pangolin happens to be one of them. We?re trying our level best to help authorities and allow these animals to survive in the wild,? said Gunawardena.? ?
?Pangolin scales trafficked?to China??- Gunasekara
Airing his concerns to the Daily Mirror, former Deputy Director of Customs and founder of the Customs Biodiversity Protection Unit Samantha Gunasekara said that it?s illegal to retain any part of a pangolin as it is a protected species. ?Therefore transportation or causing harm naturally becomes illegal under the FFPO. According to the CITES convention, the pangolin was included in the Appendix 1 among other species threatened with extinction. Therefore it essentially bans international trade of pangolins, their parts or derivatives. There?s a huge smuggling racket going on with pangolin scales and it has reached Sri Lanka as well. Over the past few years many people were caught attempting to smuggle pangolin scales out of the country.
Although it was only found at the airport or the harbour, it eventually reached the interiors of the country and pangolin scales were found in areas such as Beruwala as well. All pangolin scales are trafficked to China and with the influx of Chinese in the country, this becomes more evident. There?s a huge threat for other bio-matter such as red sandalwood, edible bird nests and wallapatta as well. Now that these scales are being caught, people crush them and smuggle, so that they cannot be identified. Since it?s a rarely seen animal its actual count is unknown. In addition to the Chinese local people also consume pangolin flesh and people sometimes rare pangolins at home. When taking all these factors into consideration, pangolins have a dwindling population in Sri Lanka and worldwide,? explained Gunasekara.? ?

Medical education: Minimum standards revised despite SLMC recommendations
	
The Government Medical Officers? Association (GMOA) said today the Cabinet had amended the minimum standards for medical education despite Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne?s request to approve the minimum standards recommended by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).
GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge told a news briefing that the recently issued gazette notification on minimum standards for medical education cited two credit passes and one simple pass at the GCE Advanced Level examination as the entry criterion.
?The entry criterion initially approved by the SLMC was three merit passes at GCE A/Ls. Minister Senaratne expressed his concern with regard to the issue at two instances saying the Cabinet made amendments to this criterion disregarding his need to approve the recommended standards. It is in question whether this move to revise the minimum standards for medical education is a result of a confidential committee within the Cabinet. Perhaps, it could be politically motivated. The Cabinet should discuss this matter in its upcoming sessions. It should review these amendments,? he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

The  scholarly monk will be  missed by all
	
Most. Ven. Prof. Bellanwila Wimalarathana Anunayake Thera (Left) the Chancellor of Sri Lanka Jayawardhanapura University of Sri Lanka, attending the 30th Anniversary of Inter-religious Gathering of Prayer for World Peace held at Japan Kyoto International Conference Centre, Mt Hiel and Seiryuken on 3-4 August 2017. The late Prof. Bellanwila Wimalarathana Thera is seen with the representative of the Pope.
Today the Buddhist World, other religious heads, eminent local and international dignitaries and the lay public have been shocked on hearing of the demise of Ven. Prof Bellanwila Wimalaratana Nayaka Thera, who was the Chief incumbent of the Bellanwila Rajamaha Viharaya.
Sri Lanka and the world have lost a great Buddhist Leader and most sought after preacher in Buddha Dhamma both locally and overseas. The Thera worked tirelessly to instill human qualities, human values and harmony in people belonging to all religions.? ?
Ven. Prof Bellanwila Wimalaratne Nayaka Thero won great respect from the community at large, was of pleasing character, approachable, charming, held high-profile responsibilities, provided community services and was a voice of reason for national reconciliation- a need of the hour.? ?
The brother of the Thera, Ven Dr Bellanwila Dharmaratana Nayaka Thera, the present Religious Adviser for The Buddhist Library Singapore and Sanghanayake of Singapore was also a tower of strength and a guiding light for the late Ven. Thera.? ?
Scholarly monk?
Ven. Prof. Bellanwila Wimalaratana Thera, a scholarly monk, obtained a Bachelor of Arts Degree offering Sinhala, Pali and Economics from the Vidyalankara University of Kelaniya and in 1972 obtained an Honours Degree in Pali language and Literature from the University of Sri Lanka Vidyodaya Campus. He thereafter progressed in his academic achievement by obtaining a PhD from the university of Lancaster, U.K.in 1982.? ?
With these academic and professional achievements the Thera went on to be the Principal at Paramadhamma Chetiya Pirivena, Ratmalana and lecturer at Teacher Training College for Buddhist monks at Ratmalana. At Sri Jayawardenapura University he served as a visiting lecturer, lecturer, Associate Professor and Professor. The Thera also served as a visiting professor at the school of Oriental and African Studies ? University of London U.K.? ?
Ven. Prof. Bellanwila Wimalaratne Thera was the Chancellor of the Sri Jayawardenapura University which he had served in different positions since 1980.? ?
This scholarly monk also held many high-profile responsibilities and served on many Boards of Management at Academic Institutions.? ?
He was a member of University Senate ? University of Sri Jayawardenapura, Member Board of Management National Institute of Education ? NIE, Academic Committee ? Buddhist and Pali University and Academic Committee Postgraduate Institute of Pali and Buddhist Studies University of Kelaniya. He was also a member of the National Education Commission, beginning his service in 2006. He was also a member of the Advisory Council of the All Ceylon Buddhist Congress.? ?
Ven. Prof. Bellanwila Wimalaratana Nayaka Thero served as the Secretary General ? Kotte Sri Kalyani Samagri Dharma Maha Sangha of Sriyomopali Mahanikaya and thereafter as the Anunayaka Thero. During this period the Ven. Thera was a tower strength to the Mahanayake Thera Ven. Ittepana Dhammalankara Thera, Ven. Prof. Kotapitiye Rahula Anu Nayaka Thero and the Nayaka Theras of the Kotte Chapter Temples which included the Sri Jayawardenarama Viharaya at Cotta Road. The priest was closely associated with Nayaka Thera Ven. Shastrapathi Devahandiye Sri Pangnasekera Thera. This also gave me an opportunity to meet the priest and other high priests of the Kotte Chapter including the Late Ven Sobhitha Nayaka Thera. Theese priests were always present at various pinkamas and almsgivings at the temple.?

	The funeral of late prelate Ven. Prof. Bellanwila Wimalarathana Thera, will be held today at the Sri Jayewardenepura University grounds
	?Fearless Ven. Wimalaratana Thera never stood for communal politics nor got onto any such stage during his illustrious life, full of spirits.?Nor did he play hosannas to anyone how much mighty he would be since he did not expect any personal?
	favours from any person
International recognition?
In the international arena Ven. Prof. (Dr) Bellanwila Wimalaratana Thera served as the Secretary General of the World Buddhist Sangha Council. He was also a frequent invitee among those who addressed many Buddhist and inter-religious conferences. These included the Inter-religious conference in New Delhi, India in 2009, General Assembly of Religions in Peace in New York in 2008, South Asia Interfaith Harmony Conclave in New Delhi in 2007, 7th General Conference of World Buddhist Sangha Council in Chinese Taipei in 2000 and Global Hindu Buddhist Initiative on Conflict Avoidance and Environment in Septmeber 2015.? ?
The Ven. Thera was also a frequent visitor to the London Buddhist Viharaya and a close associate of Late Head monk Most Ven. Medagama Vajiragnana Nayaka Thera, the head of London Buddhist Vihara. He delivered the Anagarika Dharmapala 150th Birth Anniversary Oration at the London Buddhist Vihara.? ?
Buddhist literature?
Another noteworthy contribution of this great monk is the contribution he made during his monkhood to enrich Buddhist literature. Not only is he a voracious reader, reputed orator and Dhamma preacher, but also a brilliant writer in both Sinhala and English languages.? ? The Ven. Thera published many books on Buddhism in English and Sinhalese which included: Buddhism Society and Environment, Concept of great Man in Buddhist literature and Iconography, Buddhism among other religions and Facts of Buddhism. He also translated to English Volume 1 of Anguttara Nikaya.? ? ?Manasa?, the Sinhala Translation of Mind Unshaken penned by Ohn Valters, Sanyutta Nikaya and Minisage Aagam are some of his other works.? ?
Social service
The Ven. Thera served as Chairman of the Sri Lanka Community Department Foundation, Bellanwila which assists the people in the village in various community development projects and offers vocational guidance to young school leavers.? ?In 1984 I remember as the Chairman of People?s Bank attending a function at the temple where the bank provided loans for those starting small businesses and helped in the purchase of three wheeled vehicles for the purpose of self-employment. There was also a gift of computers from Singapore to educate the youth in computer applications.? ?
This was only a fraction of the many social service projects carried out under the guidance of the late Thera in the fields of providing education, training, skills development and providing job opportunities for the youth.? ?
Inter-religious activities?
In inter-religious activities the priest played his role as the Co-President and founder Member of the Congress of Religions and was the President of Religion for Peace. He always stood for a unitary state and national unity.?
He also worked very closely with all religious dignitaries to achieve peace and harmony.? ?
The tributes paid by many religious leaders show the great respect they have for the lead role the late Thera played in inter-religious activities and in his attempts to bring people from all religions together.? ?
The Ven. Thera came to the rescue of the business community at a time of a national crisis. This was the time when there was tension between Sinhalese and Muslims over the Halal registration.? This became a very hot issue and was a threat which could have destroyed local businesses and the economy of the country. This was ultimately settled by both parties. Businessmen were assisted by their respective religious leaders with Ven. Prof. Bellanwila Wimalaratana Thero playing a lead role to ensure there was a peaceful solution to the problem.? ?
The Ven. Thera also participated at the Sri Lanka Economic Summit organized by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce in the year 2008 and gave expert comments as a panelist. The priest also offered guidance to business leaders at all times.? ?
Grand Esala Perehera?
The Esala Perahera (Pageant) of the Bellanwila Viharaya commenced in 1950 under the guidance of Ven. Bellanwila Sri Somaratana Nayaka Thera. This was a very difficult period. However the pageant organised by this temple has now developed as a leading Esala Perahera in the Colombo District. The pageant is held with the participation of many traditional dancers, elephants and other processions; all displaying the rich cultural traditions of Sri Lanka. Ven. Prof. Bellanwila Wimalaratna Thera was responsible for the Esala Perehera developing into one of the most looked forward to pageants in Colombo.??
Kotte Sri Kalyani Samagri Dharma Maha Sangha Sabha -?
The Maha Nayaka Thera of Kotte Sri Kalyani Samagri Dharma Maha Sangha Sabha Ven. Dr. Iththepane Dhammalankara Thera, Ven. Prof. Bellanwila Wimalarathana Anu Nayaka Thera, Ven. Prof. Kotapitiye Rahula Anu Nayaka Thera, the Committee of the Kotte Maha Sangha, Late Ven Madhuluwawe Sobhitha Nayaka thera, a key member of the Kotte Sri Kalyani Samagri Dharma Maha Sangha Sabha all combined to be a strong force for all Buddhists. The passing away of the Ven. Prof. Bellanwila Wimalarathana Annunayake Thera has left great voids in the Buddha Sasana, Kotte Sri Kalyani Samagri Dharma Maha Sangha Sabha and the Maha Sanga. The late Thera who was the voice of Sinhala Buddhists, spoke fearlessly in support of activities of national interest and was a guiding light for the youth of this country will be missed by all.? ?
May the Ven. Thera attain the supreme bliss of Nirvana!? ?

Vijaya Kumaratunga: The stranger and the intruder
	
From 1969, which saw Sugathapala Senarath Yapa?s Hanthane Kathawa, to 1989, which saw Vasantha Obeyesekere?s Kadapathaka Chaya, Vijaya Kumaratunga, the greatest matinee idol to ever grace the screen in this country, averaged about five movies a year. In both these films, undervalued for their time, reassessed more favourably today, he was cast opposite that other great actor, Swarna Mallawarachchi, and yet no two roles could have been more different: in Hanthane Kathawa he was the lover, the swashbuckling epitome of youth, while in Kadapathaka Chaya he was the impulsive rapist, the cold, calculating businessman who meets his end at the hands of his own victim. It took Vijaya all of 20 years to make the shift; perhaps (for I can only speculate here) another 20 years would have seen him diversify his range further.??
At their toughest, heroes and superstars are virtually invincible. Supremely confident of their infallibility, their presumptions of their own strengths, they can only glare at those who boost their own presumptions. (Right after G. W. Surendra ends his valedictory for the protagonist in the opening of Welikathara, that protagonist, a newly promoted ASP, smiles rather contemptuously at him; the ASP, played by Gamini Fonseka, let us know then and there that only he had the prerogative to assess and inflate himself.) They don?t opt for cooperation because being cooperative in this society is, when it comes to heroes at least, seen as a sign of weakness, so much so that those who prefer to dream rather than do, to idealise rather than act, turn out to be inadequate versions of themselves (as with many of Tony Ranasinghe?s characters).??
Vijaya Kumaratunga was our first on-screen hero who taught us that heroes need not always opt for unilateral action, and that the occasional compromise, the infrequent lapse, was forgivable and, more to the point, expendable. The romantic male stars, from here, weren?t really aggressive, but for the most they teetered between the domineeringness that Fonseka embodied and the fragility, the sense of inferiority, that Ranasinghe embodied. Both Fonseka and Ranasinghe instilled in their characters an intense desire to own the women they hankered after (which is why, when these two were cast together, as with Parasathumal, they tended to fight over the same love interest).
But when Ranasinghe was featured opposite Vijaya, the tide turned: it was no longer about a woman, rather about that eternal battle between age and youth. Even when he mellowed, even when he was cast against younger players, Vijaya remained very much young, which meant that he was forever destined to conquer the women he desired so much. Ranasinghe?s characters would have given up (unless, as with Duhulu Malak, the women of their dreams came back on their own accord), and Fonseka?s would have gone ahead, never bothering to try their luck with their fianc?es again, but Vijaya was different: he cared, he compromised, and he came back.??
He was almost an outsider, the man from a different world, an intruder who dared to creep in at a time when the trinity of our film industry ? Gamini, Tony, and Joe Abeywickrama ? was firmly established and had virtually monopolised that industry. They each embodied a different zeitgeist ? Gamini with heroism unhindered by moral scruples, Tony with fragility underscored by a delicate, strange, almost otherworldly handsomeness, and Joe with a sense of mock seriousness which no chaotic situation or accident could trip ? and they commanded the names and the salaries that would have made any newcomer a nonentity. But these three were from a different era. The outsider and stranger who intruded into their universe heralded a new age: an age in which education and employability had become polar opposites, an age in which stability was a hated word (simply because it was impossible to obtain, except through force). The young of those days, who had venerated heroism and fragility and mock seriousness, wanted something more: someone who could compound these qualities and embody them at the same time. They found their pivot with (who else?) Vijaya!??
There are commentators who suggest that Vijaya never really acted, that he was being himself and that he hardly ever bothered to wait for the correct cue or take. Part of the reason for that, of course, was that unlike Fonseka he never selected his scripts meticulously: what he got was what he landed. That was, at one level, crude and almost primeval, but then in a country as small and yet indefinable as Sri Lanka being overly selective could have swept him off at a time when the market he inadvertently targeted ? the young and the dispossessed, cut off from their own familial bonds ? would have crassly ignored him if he wasn?t that frequently cast. Having averaged about one or two films from 1967 (Manamalayo) to 1969 and 1970 (Hanthane Kathawa), he struck gold at the box office with Neil Rupasinghe?s Hathara Denama Soorayo (in 1971). Three years later, Dharmasena Pathiraja chose him for Ahas Gawwa, and three more years later, he chose him again for Eya Dan Loku Lamayek.??
When Gamini and Tony and Joe were cast as villains, they evaded our sympathy and evoked our deepest fears. Gamini began his career with a set of films that had him play around with the duality between love and hate, as with Seethala Wathura; Tony became less likeable as he aged, as Ahasin Polawata and Duhulu Malak evidently showed; and Joe, when he was not raging and ranting like a self-deluded man (like the domineering dictatorial husband in Adara Hasuna), played around with a variation of the duality that Gamini had, this time between fear and self-mockery (Welikathara). But even at their most dislikeable, these men knew what they were in for: they didn?t fall or trip, and if they did, the script prepared us for them. With Vijaya, on the other hand, those trips and falls were never part of a carefully ordered and ordained narrative. The lover in Wasana has to croon ?Oba Langa Inna? to try and get back Malini Fonseka, and in Eya Dan Loku Lamayak, he endures the hatred and contempt of a teenage lover of Malini, played by Wimal Kumar de Costa, to marry her.??
Having covertly slept with Helen in Pathiraja?s Bambaru Avith, and having been upbraided by his two friends (Amarasiri Kalansuriya and de Costa), the man still feels confused about what he?s done: ?What COULD I have done?? he sternly asks de Costa, the fiery revolutionary, as de Costa warns him about the chaos he?s unleashed on the fishing community they?ve moved to. If Bambaru Avith feels rather operatic today, rather blown out and loud and crude and deliberately cluttered, it?s not because of Premasiri Khemadasa?s innovative music only, but also because of the fact that Vijaya had become a new lover: the anti-heroic lover, who falls in love with a peasant girl engaged to another man (Cyril Wickramage). Vijaya trips and falls, but until the end those trips and falls are never explicitly rationalised by the script. Consequently, by being an anti-heroic lover, he had become an anti-heroic hero: the sort that his audiences had wanted all along, and got, with every other subsequent role of his.??
If Vijaya seemed careless in his movies and the scripts did nothing to hold him back, the only consolation we had was the fact that he had no one but himself to fall on. In Vasantha Obeyesekere?s Diyamanthi he throws away his ?useless? Bachelor of Arts certificate after he gets evicted by an irate landlady (Ratnawali Kekunuwala) and, in one of the most bizarrely concocted coming-together sequences I?ve ever seen in any film, befriends a pickpocket (de Costa) and a hard-done-by, recently released criminal (Somasiri Dehipitiya), as they venture out and make friends with a carefree heiress (Malini Fonseka). These men have nothing but themselves to turn to: they have no family, no one dependent on them and no one they are dependent on. In one sense this was more Godardian than Hitchcockian (the latter term being used by critics when reviewing Diyamanthi), except that Godard?s characters didn?t just lack families and dependents but were downright repelled by them. That attitude of being repelled and being alienated came out, for Vijaya, in Pathiraja?s greatest film, Para Dige.??
Vijaya never really acted, that he was being himself and that he hardly ever bothered to wait for the correct cue or take. Part of the reason for that, of course, was that unlike Fonseka he never selected his scripts meticulously
In Ahas Gawwa the ending, which to many seemed apt and expedient for the two protagonists (Vijaya and Amarasiri Kalansuriya), also seemed rather contrived: there was nothing to suggest that either of them would have taken part in strikes if they were placed in a different setting. There needed to be an explicit rationale, failing which their act of participating in those strikes looked almost manufactured. Para Dige, for the first time in Vijaya?s and (I think) Pathiraja?s career, did away with a need for such a rationale, if at all because the characters don?t come to us with any back story: neither Chandare, the protagonist, nor his girlfriend (Indira Jonklaas) encourages us to find out more about their pasts, barring a section of the narrative in which Chandare returns to his sister (Sunethra Sarachchandra) and his parents (Chitra Vakishta and Joe Abeywickrama); that section, very much unlike the freewheeling style of everything that preceded it, naturally felt detached from the rest of the story.??
This evolution ? from the in-your-face likeability of the seventies to the cynical ambivalence of the eighties (at the end of Para Dige, Vijaya as Chandare embodies this ambivalence by answering his girlfriend?s questions with a slapdash remark: ?I don?t know?) ? was obviously one which would have led to a shift in his career, and like Gamini and Tony and Joe he would have made a leap to a new phase. But then there was only one film which indicated this shift, and after it was released in 1989, he was shot down and killed. That film was Obeyesekere?s Kadapathaka Chaya, where for the entirety of the plot he teeters between a superficial charm and a repressed sexual hideousness that spells out his own murder. Kadapathaka Chaya, unlike Dadayama and Palagetiyo, plays out like clockwork: the past and the future are inextricably woven together, and in Vijaya?s characterisation of Danaratne, the mudalali who rapes his own sister-in-law, there is an inevitable deterioration, which at times frightens us. Perhaps Kadapathaka Chaya was the only fitting end we could have had to a man we wanted so badly to be: a lover, heroic, anti-heroic, or otherwise.? ??

Will transform country into a paradise: MR
	
Former President and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa, who spearheaded the Local Government election campaign of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), yesterday claimed that they had a plan to transform the country into a paradise if the SLPP wins the February 10 local government elections.
Addressing the final election rally of the SLPP held in Homagama last night, Mr. Rajapaksa said they have already shown what they are capable of by putting an end to a 30-year war within a short period of 3 years.
"I invite people to have faith in us. People already know the development projects we have carried out to uplift the country. Today, no such development is taking place. During my visit to Jaffna recently, residents complained that not even a culvert had been dug by this government. If we are voted in, we have a plan to transform the country into a paradise,? he said.
He said the government had gotten it's priorities mixed up as Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was more focused on providing free Wi-Fi to the public without paying attention to the real problems of the people such as hunger resulting from the high cost of living.
He said the performance of the country's economy has been abysmal during the past three years.?The economy is in chaos today. the mismanagement of LG bodies has resulted in garbage piling up all over the country. Dengue has also shown a marked increase resulting in more deaths. The underworld is raising its ugly head again and drugs are being sold out in the open," he said.
He said the people should vote for the SLPP to save their children from the drug menace."To save the country and our children from the drug menace and to prevent the country from being divided into pieces, vote for the lotus bud,' he said.
National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader Wimal Weerawansa said the government was attempting to betray the country 'politically' to separatist groups and the Global Tamil Forum (GTF).
"This is why the Minister Counsellor of the Sri Lankan High Commission in London was suspended for making a gesture towards the protesting LTTE supporters. Later on, the President had reinstated him. Suspending the officer is not reconciliation. Becoming a puppet of the GTF is not reconciliation. We would like to thank the minister counsellor for standing up for the country," he said.
Meanwhile, MP Bandula Gunawardane opined that the leaders of the government including the President and the Premier fear that they could be facing an election defeat.
The rally in support of the SLPP was organised by MP Bandula Gunawardana and was attended by Joint Opposition party leaders G. L. Peiris, Dinesh Gunawardena, Wimal Weerawansa, Udaya Gammanpila, MPs Gamini Lokuge, Lohan Ratwatte, Rohitha Abeygunawardane, SLPP candidates, artistes and professionals. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Win at LG Polls a stepping stone: JVP
	
Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said yesterday even though they would not be able to restore the economy that has collapsed just by winning the Local Government elections, they were using it as a stepping stone to gaining power in 2020.
He told the JVP?s final rally held in Maharagama yesterday that its election campaign was a resounding success which would guarantee a remarkable victory for them while the vote base of the UNP, the SLFP and the SLPP were sure to decline at these elections.
He said the JVP?s campaign against fraud and corruption during their election campaign had forced other parties to base their campaigns on it as well. He said this was despite the fact that the leaders of these parties, President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, being engulfed in a cycle of fraud and corruption for the last seventy years.
?Ex-President Rajapaksa said he would not allow members elected to LG bodies from his party to undertake contracts. The Prime Minister was forced to remove MP Ravi Karunanayake as assistant leader of the party. President Sirisena also started bragging about fraud and corruption while keeping fraudsters and corrupt individuals on his stage.
It is the JVP that forced them to centre their election campaigns on fraud and corruption whereas they started with other slogans such as the risk of the country being divided and the Prime Minister issue,? he said.
Mr. Dissanayake said that governments that ruled the country so far had been engaged in massive fraud, corruption and misuse of public money and stressed that the JVP was committed to putting a stop to that culture of impunity.
He asked the people to come forward to fight against fraud and corruption by casting their votes wisely at the upcoming polls. (Ajith Siriwardana)
