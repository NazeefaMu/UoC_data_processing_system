Asgiriya chapter issues tough statement
	
Following a meeting of the Karaka Sangha Sabha, the Mahanayake of the Asgiriya Chapter, the Most Venerable Warakagoda Gnanaratana Thera in a strongly worded statement today highlighted concerns about the challenges posed by internal and external conspiracies against Sinhala Buddhists and emphasized the need for the Mahanayake Theras of the Three Nikayas and the patriotic people of the country to act in unison to face such injustices.
All other religious groups in the country should keep it in mind that Buddhists in Sri Lanka had always respected and allowed unhindered the existence of other religions. We condemn acts by other religious groups that insult this tolerant Buddhist ethic, the statement said. Although we do not approve the aggressive behaviour and speech of Bhikku Galabodaatte Gnanasara the viewpoint expressed by him cannot be discarded. Insulting Bhikkus by various groups without inquiring into the veracity of the issues raised by him cannot be condoned."

BBS challenges President, PM and former Presidents
	
The BBS today challenged the President, Prime Minister and two former Presidents to state to the public that they accept the fact that many archaeological sites were being destroyed in the Eastern Province, while Muslim extremism prevails in the country.
The Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) Organization directed the challenge towards President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and former Presidents Mahinda Rajapaksa and Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.
Addressing their weekly media briefing Sinhala Ravaya General Secretary Magalkande Sudaththa Thera said that these political leaders would definitely fail to make such statements in public because they were looking forward to winning the 2020 Presidential Election where minority votes were crucial to their cause.
These political leaders are unable to admit the bitter truth because they have their sights set on the next Presidential Election. Additionally, the Muslim Ministers will not like to solve the countrys problems via discussions, even if the Sinhala leaders wanted to. They are using the people as cats paws by promoting racism and religious extremism. These issues can be solved if Muslim politicians do not interfere, the thera said.
On the other hand, if Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka and MP Athureliye Rathana Thera could speak about these issues in Parliament, then Ven. Gnanasara Thera would certainly be content to leave it to them and stay silent. If they wish us to leave the country, we can do that also, but only if these issues are discussed in Parliament, Ven. Sudaththa said.
BBS General Secretary Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thera has been made the target for the wrath of the authorities as he was contracted by politicians, but he did not follow anyones contracts. He only followed national interests for the betterment of the country. If politicians continue to tarnish the name of Ven. Gnanasara Thera it would result in him contesting the 2020 Presidential Election.
People now accepted him as a religious leader and will support him to become the President at the next election, Ven. Sudaththa said.
Meanwhile, Ven. Sudaththa Thera said Ven. Gnanasara Thera would be able to appear in the Supreme Court by Thursday (22) for the Fundamental Rights (FR) Petition only if the Police and relevant authorities assured his safety. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Govt. blasts UN Special Rapporteur report on SL
	
While rejecting the allegations made by UN Special Rapporteur on Independence of Judges, Monica Pinto in her report to United Nations Human Rights Council on Sri Lanka's judicial system, the government today said the report was a violation of the country's sovereignty.
We are surprised by the allegations made by her who was in Sri Lanka for only seven days. Her knowledge on the judicial systems of various countries is questionable " Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said making a statement in Parliament claiming that he is revealing the official stance of the government on Ms. Pinto's report.
This report will tarnish Sri Lanka's image and violate the country's sovereignty, he said.
The minister said Ms. Pinto's remarks on the Constitutional Council was unacceptable.
"Ms Pinto in her report has alleged that the Constitutional Council is not independent as all appointments are made by the President. What she does not know is that the President can make the appointments only if the Constitutional Council approves them" the minister said.
He said the allegation made by Ms. Pinto that the Constitutional Council was far from being independent as it comprised politicians was unfair as the representatives of the people wanted politicians appointed to it. Appointments to such bodies should be made according to the wishes of the people and not according to whims and fancies of any foreign organization," the minister said in this regard.
He said Ms. Pinto's suggestion that the Attorney General should conduct investigations on crime was also unacceptable as it was not a norm practiced by any country in the globe.
"Ms Pinto has probably included information provided to her by NGOs, the minister alleged and added that the government had already made arrangements to notify its stance on the UN Special Rapporteurs report through relevant diplomatic channels. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

The first of several protests to topple the unity government will be launched on Thursday, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today.
JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva said they would defeat the present regime just as they overthrew that of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa.
He said the governments recent action contradicts its election pledges and the suppression of peoples rights has resulted in the decision to cut short the tenure of this government.
Mr.Silva said the first public protest would begin with a rally at the Viharamahadevi Park.
The unity governments manifesto stated that the nation will be developed and the culprits who misused the countrys national resources will be penalized but instead of doing so they have ruined the economy and are protecting the robbers and doing little or nothing to stop hate mongering by extremist groups, he said.

NPC crisis resolved
	
The crisis of the Northern Provincial Council (NPC) was sorted out yesterday after a compromise between Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran and Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Leader R. Sampanthan at the behest of two religious dignitaries and the political allies.
The differences were ironed out following the exchange of letters between the TNA leader and the Chief Minister.
The TNA leader in his letter yesterday informed Mr. Wigneswaran that he had already informed the Northern Province Governor that the no confidence motion would be withdrawn.
The crisis erupted after a section of TNA members handed over a no confidence motion against Mr. Wigneswaran and another set switching allegiance to him. The Chief Minister drew a flak as he asked two ministers of the Provincial Council to go on leave to facilitate inquiries into fresh charges frames against them.
However, the TNA leadership insisted that the initial board of inquiry had no finding of guilt against these two members, and therefore further inquiries were not warranted.
The two leaders refused to budge from their stands eventually deepening the crisis.
In the meantime, PLOTE leader Darmalingam Sitharthdan , EPRLF leader Suresh Premachandran and TELO Selvam Adaikkalanathan requested both to arrive at a common position . Mr. Samapanthan finally agreed to allow further inquiries against the two ministers against whom there were no finding of guilt initially. Also, he agreed to ask them not to interfere with the inquiries.
The Chief Minister softened his position and decided to send the two ministers on leave. Alongside, Jaffna Bishop Jutsin Bernard Gnanapragasam and a leading Hindu priest also intervened and prevailed upon the two to resolve the problem. (Kelum Bandara)

Right of Reply: Are doctors on strike everyday
	
A usual scene at a govt. hospital
I was hoping to continue my discussion from where I stopped on June 13 in the article titled Spotlight on doctors, earnings disregarding their service regarding some issues pointed out by Mr. Roshan Dodanwela in his article on May 31. However, an article by Mr. Sarath N. Perera published on June 13 warrants addressing as well. It also contained some misinterpretations and erroneous statements that should be corrected. 
Mr. Perera, being a learned lawyer, has completely missed the essence of my very first article (published on May 24), the key point being that doctors should not be judged by an occasional strike, but by what is carried out daily. His article reminds me of the blind man who took hold of the elephants tail and thought it was the elephant in its entirety. But when a person with sight does that, hes deliberately ignoring the obvious.
Mr. Perera looks at a day when doctors have been on strike and thinks its all they do, completely disregarding what they do on other days, thereby painting a distorted picture of doctors wasting public money. He seems to have written his article with this fallacy. He has misinterpreted several points I mentioned to suit his agenda, thereby causing irreparable damage to the opinion of the same fair-minded and balanced citizens he has mentioned, who come to government hospitals day after day and reap the benefits of public health services provided by doctors (and other staff) educated with their money. Hence, while Mr. Perera has the right to hold onto his wrong impression, if he so wishes, it is our duty to enlighten the public regarding the truth so they wont be misled. Also, the recent strikes have been due to politicians dragging on the issues without properly addressing and resolving them despite repeated requests; and even during strikes, about ninety percent of work is still carried out (as pointed out in my first article) which goes unnoticed as usual. 


Mr. Perera at a certain point has commented by citing many an occasion on how politicians are playing out public funds, the author cannot justify the doctors and medical students wasting public money. However, my article was to emphasize that we DONT waste public money, hence how would I justify it Not only is it a misinterpretation but also an erroneous statement, as it implies I have accepted that like politicians, we are also wasting money, which is his opinion and not mine. 
Another fabrication is that Im trying to single out doctors in the GMOA and portray them as a special category of government servants on the basis that they contribute to the free healthcare services. For one thing, I never mentioned anything about the GMOA as I was writing on behalf of all doctors irrespective of the union, though Mr. Perera keeps referring to the GMOA. Also, Im not trying to single out doctors by mentioning the services we provide but trying to affirm that we are carrying out our duties as expected; and although he accuses that I was ..conveniently forgetting.. that we are taught by the state for those very purposes, what I emphasised was that we were already fulfilling them day in and day out, while people like
Mr. Perera are conveniently forgetting we do so because of anoccasional strike. 


"Mr. Perera looks at a day when doctors have been on strike and thinks its all they do, thereby painting a distorted picture of doctors wasting public money"

Both Mr. Dodanwela and Mr. Perera have missed my point regarding medical students. I didnt complain about the difficulties, nor give it as another reason why doctors should be treated differently from other professionals as Mr. Perera has (once again) misinterpreted. What I stated was their commitment, effort and hardships are completely ignored, and money is the only factor talked about regarding medical education. I didnt mention students of other faculties in my first article because it was irrelevant to my topic (which was about doctors and medical education) and not because I was in the complete dark about their difficulties. But since both gentlemen have raised that issue, I would make a few comments. 
Mr. Perera talks about taxpayers money allocated for free medical education and therefore doctors are eternally indebted to the ordinary citizen and there is a duty and obligation to serve his/her motherland rather than pursuing greener pastures abroad. Unfortunately, he seems to be in the dark that they apply to all streams of higher education. All university students are educated with taxpayers money. However, how many contribute to the public sector after passing out While emphasising my intention not to make any discriminations, it has to be said that apart from the medical faculty and a few others, only a minority of those in other faculties would work in the public sector to serve the people who funded their education, while the majority would work in the private sector, abroad, or remain unemployed. But no one complains about the waste of public money spent on them, or about their eternal debt. Im not saying its their fault, as the government has failed to absorb them into the public sector and make use of their services. My point is that while a vast majority of doctors are giving back their services to the public health system after passing out, there are still those criticised for wasting public money based on an infrequent strike, which is unreasonable and totally absurd. It is not only doctors but numerous other government employees (who would also have been educated with the taxpayers money) who go on strike, but nobody talks about wasting public money on their education. Hence, obviously theres discrimination and even professional jealousy towards doctors. 


Mr. Perera has questioned why doctors of the GMOA are joining with government medical students and causing them to refrain from carrying on educational activities while private medical college (PMC) students are allowed to carry on. Its a well-known fact that throughout history, university students have protested whenever they are faced with unresolved issues, especially against threats to free education, and its the same situation at present. Its the students decision and not caused by doctors, which is a baseless allegation. Regarding the so-called PMC students, leaving aside their educational activities, actually they shouldnt be there in the first place because among other things, its lacking, it hasnt got SLMC approval and there were warnings by the SLMC to the public, which students and their parents have disregarded. 
Mr. Dodanwela has commented on the burden of accountability when working abroad. If accountability is such a burden in foreign countries, why do some doctors migrate and seek employment abroad And when they start feeling the burden, why dont they come back Obviously, its not an issue for doctors doing their job properly; and when he states so doctors have it easy here where accountability is concerned, I wonder whether hes implying that doctors here are careless and negligent, because its due to vigilance and proper care that thousands of lives are saved daily. Unfortunately, when things run smoothly, they go unnoticed as always, and a few isolated incidents are given enormous publicity. It must be emphasized that certain incidents publicized in the media where doctors are accused of medical negligence are interpreted by people or journalists with no medical background and the truth could be completely different when analyzed correctly from a medical point of view. 


An issue regarding our medical standards has also been pointed out by Mr. Dodanwela. Though they are nowhere near the best compared to Switzerland, Norway or Australia, its absurd, even ridiculous, to compare our services with those countries. Doctors there work under ideal conditions, excellent facilities, comfortable environments and have enough time to spend on a patient. The conditions we work under dont come anywhere close, with a heavy workload, overcrowding, time constraints and insufficient facilities and staff. While admitting that its good to explain to the patient their medical condition, medication, side-effects and so on, unfortunately its not practical here because the situation doesnt allow for that. There are three to four hundred patients appearing in a few hours in clinics and thousands of patients in OPDs, which means that only a few minutes can be spent with a patient to get their relevant details and to examine them and prescribe medication. If we try to follow whats done in the above mentioned countries, we wont be covering even half the number of patients in the available time. However, any significant issues would be conveyed to the patient. 
Towards the end of his article, Mr. Dodanwela states  but when doctors go on strike, people suffer and can die. Though doctors dont let people die even when on strike, the concealed meaning of this statement carries an important valid point, which is,because of what doctors do everyday, peoples lives are saved and their suffering alleviated. Mr. Perera also states (while forgetting the work done in a hospital even during a strike) that almost all government hospitals are at a standstill at the time of the strike, and that working hours of other workers are lost due to work stoppages of doctors. If that is so, he has to admit that on all other days, government hospitals function smoothly because of the work carried out by doctors, which he has totally ignored. 


Finally, considering the articles by the two gentlemen, one can see that to conclude that public money spent on doctors has gone to waste, Mr. Dodanwela has only considered our perks and rewards and a few negative issues, ignoring numerous positives, thousands of lives saved and illnesses cured; and Mr. Perera has only considered the ten percent of work thats not done on the day of an occasional strike, while disregarding the hundred percent service provided day after day. Its like considering only the tail and concluding that the elephant is like a rope, hence the money spent on it is a waste. The public should realize this obvious distortion and look beyond the tail at the elephant carrying logs. 
I wrote this (and the previous) article hoping to clear up some issues that were pointed out. However, I wont be surprised if someone still finds something to argue about saying we are wasting public money. I appeal to the public not to judge doctors by strikes alone, which is only done about one percent of the time, but by the remaining ninety nine percent where they provide services for the public. Only then will you see the correct picture.

Sampath Bank revolutionizes payments landscape with PayApp
	
Continuing to bring innovative banking solutions to the Sri Lankan market for over 30 years, Sampath Bank announced the launch of a revolutionary digital payment platform, the Sampath PayApp, recently.
This path breaking mobile based application enables Sampath Bank account holders to send and receive money directly from and to their bank accounts, in real-time, right on their mobile devices. Given its superior convenience, a growing number of the countrys leading merchants are signing up for SampathPayApp already.
At Sampath Bank, we have always leveraged emerging technologies to add value to our customers lives. In line with this, wed like to now dedicate the Sampath PayApp with a host of unique features to businesses and consumers around the island. We have designed this platform with a singular focus on providing users with the most convenient electronic payment medium without compromising on security. And we look forward to seeing it transform the way we Sri Lankans conduct our day to day transactions, said Ajith Salgado, Chief Information Officer, Sampath Bank.
Consumers can begin using the product by simply downloading the app from the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store and activating it with their mobile banking PIN. They will not require credit or debit cards and can use their existing Sampath Bank accounts to make payments. Doing away with the inconveniences related to handling cash, PayApp allows them to make payments either by scanning the QR code at the point of billing or via encrypted sound. Its remote payment capabilities enable them to pay merchants who are not in close proximity. The Bank has also extended its peer to peer money transfer solution to the Sampath PayApp, permitting users of the app to send money through it too. This makes it the first fully self-activated mobile payment application in the country to offer 3 secure methods of payment viz. encrypted sound, remote payments and QR codes.
Sampath Bank has also done away with several entry barriers that have held businesses back from adopting existing electronic payment methods. Merchants will not be required to make any commitment on transaction volumes with Sampath PayApp.
They can download the app and complete the initial setup on their existing mobile devices by themselves and get the facility activated at the nearest Sampath Bank branch. The considerably lower commission ratestranslate into significant year round savings for their business. Being mobile based, it doesnt require them to make any additional investments in hardware. The simplicity and convenience brought in by the platform is set to enable swifter and more efficient processing of transactions.
Cutting down on the need to handle cash, SampathPayApps real time transfer capability will allow merchants to receive payments directly into their bank accounts, instantaneously. The system allows them to generate electronic payment receipts for both the customer and the business. With all transactions being recorded digitally, business users can query the system about past records. Merchants will be able to manage all their payments related administrative functions using the Apps web portal. Sampath PayApp can also be extended to integrate their existing websites and ERP systems.
The initial response we have received from the market has been very encouraging. While we continue to grow the network of merchant partners accepting payments over the platform, we look forward to rolling out a host of benefits and privileges for consumers transacting through Sampath Pay App, Salgado added.

Secret behind his immunity
	
A political henchman currently facing bribery charges in a court case has resumed his old game after being appointed as the coordinating secretary of a leading provincial level politico, they say.
An organizer of a main party at electorate level, this worthy is abusing his position as the coordinating secretary to solicit bribes from the people visiting the provincial politicos office seeking his help.
People in the area express surprise at the provincial bigwig continuing to ignore numerous complaints being made to him against his corrupt coordinating secretary. However, the better informed sources say that the politico, a typical ladies man, is under obligation to his secretary for his services as a procurer.

Selfie The flash of fatality
	
Two brothers tragically fell victim to selfie flash, as they posed for a photo at the railway tracks in Colpetty last week (Left)The last selfie before the tragic separation of the Sri Lankan couple (Right)

As life goes on, stumbling upon precious moments that you might want to tug onto and remember for the rest of your life is natural. To fulfil this cause, photography found its way into existence. What started as black and white photographs gradually developed into colour and now selfies have erupted into a fad fever. Although introduced as a fun new trend, selfies have today become a ridiculed and fatal threat. Falling from a 30-foot bridge to utter doom to accidentally shooting themselves with guns, people have died in the most incredulous ways, all because of posing for a selfie. Selfies do not seem as harmless as they sound. Due to attempts to snap daring selfies to bask in the glory of popularity, selfie deaths have risen over time. An overwhelming rate of selfie fatalities has been reported from India, in most cases, people dying from drowning. Russia and the United States are not far behind. Selfie-related deaths have become a serious concern worldwide, so much so that taking selfies has been banned in several places. Selfie stick, any smart phones partner in crime in capturing the perfect selfie, has been banned in South Korea although they havent taken drastic measures in banning selfies altogether. But, will an all-out worldwide selfie ban take place soon enough At the rate of selfie fatalities, this could be a possibility in the future. Selfie fatalities have taken the trigger in Sri Lanka since lately, with several isolated cases of selfie deaths being reported at railway tracks. Selfies are now banned in front of moving trains and railway tracks islandwide and has been declared a punishable offence. According to a research, the people who have died from the selfie mania range from the ages 14-32, a category in the prime of their lives. Is there a particular reason for the selfie bug to infect the majority of youth Is it a psychological and social aspect related to age
laws wont stop youth from taking selfies in dangerous places
- Professor Daya Amarasekera, Peradeniya University Sociology Department
	Youngsters only concerned about their social representation
	
	
	Huge generation gap should narrow
	

A huge interest in snapping photos and uploading them on social media prevails amongst todays youth. According to Professor Amarasekera, this trend has been given prominence by those who wish to gain publicity by showing off their lifestyles, for instance by posting photos of delicacies, designer wear or supercars.
Back in the day, a photograph was used as a mode of identification. It is not the case today. The present situation influenced by modern technology has created a photo culture. The younger generation from adolescents to adults is more inclined towards this nugatory culture.
Professor Amarasekera reasons that this is due to the close association of technology with young lives.
The younger generation spends more time on social media with phones, laptops and computers. Their interaction with people is restricted. In yesteryear, people only used phones to take calls and send messages. Mobile phones were not technologically-advanced back then.
The young generation seems to have created personal freedom by excluding themselves from their family and living within their own boundaries soiled by technology. Caught up in the selfie trend beyond the point of no return, they start becoming unaware of the dangers in snapping selfies and hence fall into the clutches of untimely death.
Whether it is on a railway track or by the sea, the place does not matter to them as they focus on capturing that perfect picture. This makes them oblivious to what goes on around them and finally fall victim to the tragedy.
Professor Amarasekera stresses that todays young generation is drawn to self-display through selfies to feel socially-secure, accepted and admired, and that this kind of behaviour creates ill-will on the countrys future.
People with such mentalities do not have the countrys best interests at heart. They selfishly indulge in luxury and only express concern in their social representation. Selfie obsessions portray a person as self-absorbed and self-centred. Hence, it is hard to envision the future of the country with what the majority of youth display. To enhance sustainable development, the younger generation has to be dedicated citizens and should harbour sincere concern for the welfare of this country.
Professor Amarasekera underscores that it is pivotal to change the attitudes of the selfie mania-struck population.


"Whether it is on a railway track or by the sea, the place does not matter to them as they focus on capturing that perfect picture"

We cannot anticipate good things for the country from the young generation unless a change in attitudes takes place.
There are a lot of misdeeds that exist in the culture of todays youth. Selfies add another portal to danger to this already-threatened culture. Social media has also greatly influenced a spark in selfies. Will stringent legislation curb the selfie menace An imposed law might manipulate people and prevent them from capturing selfies in risky locations.
Professor Amarasekera feels that although this initiative will plummet the number of deaths, a law as a whole cannot accomplish changes in attitudes.
Merely because a law bans selfies from being taken near railway tracks and moving trains, it does not mean people will avoid taking selfies in other risky locations. So what is needed here is an apt attitude change. Today, there is a huge generation gap between parents and children. This gap also has to be narrowed. Parents have to be aware of the childs thinking pattern. Today, the main problem that exists is that children are more tech savvy than parents, and they remain naive of the dangerous extents to which a cell phone can be used. Will a complete ban resolve the lethal selfie malady Professor Amarasekera does not think so. If selfies are totally banned from the country, some may point it out as a violation of human rights, which is indeed a sensitive topic. Absurd selfie-taking does not apply to anyone. After all, it is an innocent enjoyment but has turned into a ferocious monster created irresponsibly by the people. The problem lies in the locations where selfies are taken and in some cases, the intentions.
According to Professor Amarasekera, a reason for youth to become selfie obsessed is partly due to severe competition in Sri Lanka for exams, as a lot of students sit for the exams but only a limited number qualify for state university entrance.
This deprives many youth of a higher education and therefore leads to unemployment. Those who fall into this category often end up in unethical relationships that are led by frustration. Their mental state is tragic and therefore they resort to temporary enjoyments through several means that could give way to stray motives. Selfie-taking is one such reason. These areas should be given serious consideration.
Taking a selfie to capture a valuable moment in life is fine. But making it a goal to take selfies every second of their life, even by posing in dangerous situations, is an unhealthy obsession. Going overboard with selfies with no control is where danger lurks and threatens lives.

Adolescents are prone to think more of the rewards than consequences of their actions
-Dr. Udena Attygalle, Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist
According to Dr. Attygalle, although some people have coined the term selfitis to selfie obsession, this is not a mental health disorder categorised under either of the two mental health classification systems. However, this does not mean excessive and obsessive capturing of selfies does not have mental health aspects. Some other mental health disorders like Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and Body Dysmorphobia can, at times, manifest as excessive selfie taking. 

"Mental health disorders like Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and Body Dysmorphobia can, at times, manifest as excessive selfie taking"
This also does not mean that all selfie attempts are related to mental health issues. Snapping a selfie is completely normal from a mental health perspective, but may have other social implications. Interestingly, it is mostly the youth who get into trouble with selfies. It is known that adolescents are, sometimes, prone to think more of the rewards than the consequences of their actions. Thus, this may have something to do with why many youngsters put themselves at risk, both in taking a selfie and posting them on social media. Advocating and highlighting the need for young people to take precautions related to their physical environment before taking a selfie and taking precautions related to their privacy before posting selfies are vital, says Dr. Attygalle.

SL should reject Minister Wijeyadasas statement: HRW
	
The Sri Lankan government should immediately reject statements made by Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe allegedly threatening to disbar a prominent lawyer for speaking out against attacks on religious minorities, the Human Rights Watch (HRW) said today.
Issuing a statement, the HRW said the incident highlights the governments failure to fully investigate and prosecute recent attacks on Muslims and Christians in the Buddhist-majority country.
On June 17, 2017, Minister Rajapakshe threatened to take necessary steps to remove Mr. Lakshan Dias from the legal profession unless Dias apologized for remarks on a television program three days earlier about attacks on the Christian community. Dias had cited a report by church groups that there were nearly 200 attacks and other harassment against Christians and their places of worship since 2015. The government of President Maithripala Sirisena, which took office in January 2015, has failed to meet its pledge to protect the rights of religious minorities, it said.
It further said the government needs to put a quick end to Justice Minister Rajapakshes attempts to bully Lakshan Dias, a leading human rights lawyer who stands up for Sri Lankans at greatest risk
Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch said by threatening Diass license, the government is threatening all marginalized groups that depend on him and other rights defenders for protection.
He said Sri Lanka has witnessed a spate of attacks against Muslims and Christians in recent years, with the government doing little to stop the violence. On May 18, in Devinuwara in Matara district, for example, some 2,000 people, including about 30 Buddhist monks, protested against a Christian place of worship, according to the National Christian Evangelical Alliance of Sri Lanka.
In June 2014, Buddhist militants attacked the Muslim community in Aluthgama, leaving four dead and nearly 80 injured, and many homes and businesses destroyed. The authorities have yet to arrest those responsible, although the leaders behind the attack are well known to the authorities.
The statement said the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka on May 31 expressed concern over acts of violence and aggression against Muslims, and urged law enforcement agencies to take all necessary action against the instigators and perpetrators of violence against religious minorities.
The Sri Lankan constitution grants everyone the right to freedom of religion or belief in worship, observance, practice, or teaching. The right is also protected in international human rights treaties to which Sri Lanka is a party, notably the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Human Rights Watch said.
Lawyers like Dias are protected by the right to freedom of expression. According to the United Nations Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, lawyers have the right to take part in public discussion of matters concerning the law, the administration of justice, and the promotion and protection of human rights without suffering professional restrictions by reason of their lawful action
Government inaction in the face of the justice ministers threat to revoke the license of a prominent rights lawyer for speaking out on behalf of an embattled community will have reverberations beyond Sri Lanka, Adams said. Sri Lankas friends should be clear they are watching the governments response closely, it said.

Solid waste piling up has caused dengue epidemic - GMOA
	
The solid waste management issues erupted following the local government bodies were crippled and resulted in the current dengue epidemic situation in the country, Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today said.
GMOA Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda said so far 63,987 dengue patients reported in the country and the total death toll exceeded 200 before the first six months where it was 78 deaths reported for the whole year in 2016. He said 54,727 patients were reported in 2016.
Dr. Ananda said the inefficiency in the solid waste management had increased the dengue breeding spots as the countrys garbage collecting mechanism has come to a standstill.
We never had a national level solid waste management programme. However the local government bodies carried a ground level waste management programme very effectively. Therefore during the past years dengue fever was controlled to a certain extent." he said.
Further, he said the issue should be addressed in a broader perspective as the current situation might be developed to an epidemic level. As total death and patient count in the first six month has exceeded the total count of the previous year Dr. Ananda said there is a need for an efficient dengue controlling mechanism.
Dr. Ananda explained the importance to set aside the personal agendas and the need for a collective action at the national level to eradicate the menace.
Meanwhile, he said GMOA would hand over their observations on the situation including the proposals to overcome the situation to President Mathripala Sirisena.
He also said the GMOA would appoint district- wise coordinators in the dengue affected districts and would establish a hotline for medical assistance within the next week. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

SriLankan to re-negotiate contracts: Hashim
	
The government will re-negotiate the purchase and termination contracts with the Airbus Industries and airline leasing company AerCap as it has become an unbearable burden on the country, Public Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim said yesterday.
He told Daily Mirror that a three-member cabinet subcommittee comprising Ministers Sarath Amunugama, Malik Smarawickrama and himself were appointed by the Cabinet to draw a renegotiation strategy and monitor the day-to-day operations of SriLankan airlines.
We have already met and discussed contentious issues involving the national carrier. Our main concern is to renegotiate the purchasing, leasing and termination agreements in a way that would not be an unbearable burden on the country, Minister Hashim stressed.
When asked about media reports that he was unaware about new recruitment to SriLankan after 2015, the minister said the media reports were correct and that he was informed about it.
The company has agreed to reduce the termination fee to US$98 million from US$154 million, a SriLankan official told Daily Mirror on condition of anonymity.
The re-structuring process including the termination of the lease agreement have been delayed because of differences between the lessee and leaser. SriLankan has recorded a loss of Rs.107 billion within eight years after terminating the management agreement with Emirates.
The minister said the government was looking for an investor to revive the national carrier and the cabinet subcommittee will discuss some of the available options.
When asked whether a change in the Board of Directors was being considered, the minister said there was no reason for such a step because they have been able to reduce the losses incurred since 2015. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

The Songs We Love Hitting the  rewind button
	
The Songs We Love organised by the Senior Choir of Visakha Vidyalaya was unveiled at the Jeremiah Dias Hall on Friday, June 2 at 7.30 pm
I like to eavesdrop at concerts. I like to listen to what people say to each other, how it reflects what they are attending and how it reflects their milieu. It was a desultory Friday evening when I got down from my friends car and walked wearily, but with a sense of optimism towards Vajira Road. The concert I was attending that day had nothing that could make it stand out in my mind from the dozen or so other concerts that throb Colombo every week. To be sure, this one was organised by a school but could that alone make it stand out Because I was optimistic, yet had no one to talk with, I hoped for the best, walked around and eavesdropped. 
Fathers, mothers, siblings, cousins and friends of those involved in the concert were not discussing the concert. They were talking about the school and its history. They were talking about the scope of the event as opposed to the event itself. There would have been a dozen other topics they rushed through but I didnt hear them. In any case, conversation in Colombo, like in Texas, is seldom continuous. But then 100 years is a long time. It gives reason for disparate conversation. It gives reason for pride. I saw and heard both. Everywhere. 
The Songs We Love, organised by the Senior Choir of Visakha Vidyalaya, in commemoration of their centenary, was a largely anglophile affair except for the last 15 minutes. There were songs I had heard before but did not cherish. There were songs I had not heard before but cherished. They took me back to that time when I first heard some of them around the piano by my music teacher. To be sure, the Jeremiah Dias Hall doesnt yield anything epic: its small, limited and austere. But there was nothing austere about The Songs We Love. Nothing small, nothing limited. 
Its only fitting that I talk about the songs before the event. I heard the usual tunes: from Disney, Rodgers and Hammerstein to the eighties. I came to love Cindy Lauper through my mother. I adored The Sound of Music through my music teacher. I heard both. While I didnt cherish some, I didnt particularly dislike any of them, because how can one dislike music And unlike most other school concerts I attended, there was nothing frilled up about it: you came, heard and enjoyed it. This has as much to do with the restraint of the choir as with the smallness of the hall, but regardless of the reason, I took to everything the choir dished us. 
And it wasnt just about a bunch of songs we could have heard anywhere. It was an attempt to bridge one generation with another within 90 minutes. Past principals, teachers and even students had gathered and were interacting with their successors. They were all seated at the front, some of them old and mellowed, the others not quite so, and they were visibly moved. How could they not be, when The Sound of Music moved into Frozen and when Tangled moved to The King and I 
Theres something about these tunes that strike us. We live in a society which dotes on Jane Austen, Barbara Cartland and Danielle Steel. In music we are very much American and nostalgic, even if the songs we listen to are derived from Europe. No concert or party would be complete without I Could Have Danced All Night, Shall We Dance and My Favourite Things. Thats the way it has been and the way it will be, for some time at least. For this reason, whenever we hear these songs, we are taken back immediately. We hit the rewind button when they open up and by the time they are over, we are so happy that we are oblivious to the world around us. 
And because that world around us is so austere, so musically disinclined, we have become incurable romantics who rebel against austerity even though we have next to nothing to help us rebel. Our school halls are small, our auditoriums a little bigger and our concerts a sordid, beaten down affair. We like to dream with what we sing, to adorn every mundane tune with colourful sets. So it was with The Songs We Love, which kept its performers changing from one costume to another, from one backdrop to another. That these were all played for us on a Friday evening helped tremendously, moreover: it helped us escape the banality of tomorrow. 
Incidentally, there was no real order that could help us decipher a pattern. But in a concert like this, order can only be imposed artificially. It tends to keep us awaiting an end, which was what The Songs We Love didnt do. I couldnt fathom an end and I dont suppose the rest of the audience fathomed one either. We measured the minutes that passed by with the music. There would have been a schedule but I neednt have bothered looking through it. The discipline and the restraint of the organisers was enough to convince me to wait patiently, until the loose ends were tied up. 
One cant eavesdrop while a concert is in session. One cant hear, one cant listen, so one has to see. Glancing around, I saw the two guests of The Songs We Love, both musically prodigies: Kishani Jayasinghe-Wijayasekara and Menaka de Fonseka Sahabandu. Kishani was visibly excited (who wouldnt be) and as the songs were played out, one by one, I saw her reciting them silently. She might have been leading the Choir, so mesmerised was she by the schoolgirls. She might also have overlooked the visuals, which were only add-ons. Because those visuals were secondary to the performers, perhaps, Kishani did not drop her smile. That smile and the occasional beam of delight, kept the girls going. It kept us going too. 
I dont know why the organisers opted for Sinhala songs towards the end but I suppose that helped tie-up those loose ends I alluded to before. So we heard the usual tunes: Nim Him Sewwa, Ran Tikiri Sina and that obligatory baila session that seems to bring the curtain down on every other school concert. They were special and overwhelming: Ran Tikiri Sina, for instance, kept me wondering where that other past Visakhian, Sumitra Peries was, while Nim Him Sewwa played on a rather bloated, epic scale not to be seen or heard with any of the English tunes before it, was a tribute to both composer (Nimal Mendis) and performer (Amaradeva). As for the baila medley: well, as I mentioned before, it was there because it was obligatory. 
The Jeremiah Dias Hall isnt really epic. With a fertile enough imagination however, even the most mundane hall can be transformed. It rained rather heavily that Friday evening: the drizzle could be seen and heard and the wind kept bothering the pianist. But that drizzle and the raindrops that swept into the Hall added something natural. They were playing selections from Frozen around that time, incidentally: rather aptly, I should think. To do with what one has, to turn it into something bigger was what the organisers achieved at the end. Probably thats why there was very little compering (by the vibrant Kumar de Silva) needed, if at all. 
100 years is a long time. The Songs We Love was just one among the many concerts, plays and other events organised to celebrate those 100 years. What we got werent just the songs we loved but also the songs we remembered. Not just remember, but remember with so much delight that they took us back to that time when we all stood around our music teachers and her piano to recite Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti blindly, without knowing the meaning behind it. I was, I admit, numbed, only because they kept me alive. For me, as it would have for Kishani and Menaka, the visuals came second. What mattered was what the show promised us. The schoolgirls kept that promise. Consequently, they kept me content.

The government will prosecute the politicians and the public servants who misused public funds and the country's national resources, Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He said the government would not allow the perpetrators of fraud and corruption to roam free but would take legal action against them.
The minister said some public officials wrongly believed they were off the hook after they being suspended for some time but this would not be the case.
We will make sure that if found guilty wrongdoers will be jailed at least for seven to eight years, he said and added that under President Maithripala Sirisena's leadership there would be no breathing space for corrupt officials.
We did not set up the Yahapalana government to protect thieves, he said and adding that currently several cases of fraud and corruption were being investigated and that some of the miscreants were produced in Court.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

True statesman Dudley was first to see dangers of Executive Presidency
	
The late Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake, as a true statesman, was the first to see and talk about the dangers of the executive presidency when a system of governance based on such a position was proposed by his own party, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said yesterday.
Speaker Jayasuriya came up with this remark at a ceremony held to mark the 106 birth anniversary of the late prime minister near his statue in Borella last evening.
Late Prime Minister displayed skills of a true statesman who thought only of the countrys future when his own party proposed the setting up of an executive presidency by speaking about the dangers such a system would bring, Speaker Jayasuriya said.
Mr. Senanayake who was a statesman was able to bring Tamil politicians and Sinhala political leaders such as the late Philip Gunawawadane onto a single political platform. He did this for the sake of the country without thinking of his political future. What we need today are such politicians, he added.
Joint opposition Parliamentary Group leader Dinesh Gunawardene said late Mr Senanayake never sold out countrys assents to foreigners. Not many people are aware that Mr Senanayake nationalized the Trincomalle Port. It is highly appropriate for the politicians of the present time to study about this leaders policy who was a great believer of a mixed economic system. He said political leaders such as Mr Senanayake who even associated with his political opponents were rare.
Southern Province Governor Hemakumara Nanayakkara recalled how Mr Senanayake created a revolution in the agriculture industry by introducing the cultivation of potatoes in Sri Lanka for the first time. One Agriculture officer named Normon Gunaratne once came to see Mr Senanayake and told him that potato could be cultivated in the country. Accordingly this officer was sent to the then Minister of Agriculture by the late Prime Minister and thus potatoes became a crop which is grown in Sri Lanka, Mr Nanayakkara said.
Dudley Senanayake Commemoration Society President Dr Karunasena Kodithuwakku recalled how the late Prime Minister Senanayake laid the foundation to build up Sri Lanka- China bilateral relationship which was followed by the late Premier Ms Sirimavo Bandaranaike and other leaders. (Yohan Perera)

Eyewitnesses reported seeing bystanders wrestle the suspect to the floor and pin him down until officers arrived at around 20 past midnight. 
Others added that the victims -members of the congregation- were trying to save a man who had collapsed at a bus stop. Other unconfirmed reports suggested that the attackers had knives and a man had been stabbed. 
Emergency service crews were also spotted giving cardiac massages to the injured. 
Mehdi, a 38-year-old worshipper, told the Evening Standard: There were loads of people coming out and the van took a left and went straight into them.

The Pentagon said the downing of the aircraft came hours after Syrian loyalist forces attacked U.S.-backed fighters, known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, in the village of JaDin, southwest of Raqqa. The rare attack was the first time a U.S. jet has shot down a manned hostile aircraft in more than a decade, and signall` ed the United States sharply intensifying role in Syrias war. 
The incident is the fourth time within a month that the U.S. military has attacked pro-Syrian government forces. Thomas rejected the Syrian governments claims that the aircraft was bombing the Islamic State, adding that JaDin was controlled by Syrian Democratic Forces and that the terrorist group had not been in the area for some time.

Yoga: The ultimate connection for a healthy mind and healthy body
	
International Day of Yoga  June 21
Yoga is an ancient physical, mental and spiritual practice that originated in India. The word Yoga derives from Sanskrit and simply means union or link. There are different types of yoga such as Bhakthi Yoga, Gnana Yoga, Karma yoga and Raja yoga.
The theme for the 2017 celebration, organized by the permanent Mission of India to the United Nations, is Yoga for Health. The theme highlights the fact that yoga can contribute in a holistic way to achieving equilibrium between mind and body. The organizers believe that this approach to health and well-being can make a direct and useful contribution to humankinds quest to achieve sustainable development and move towards lifestyles that are in harmony with nature.
In Sri Lanka, there are many Raja yoga centres in which knowledge and meditation are being taught to people from different walks of life. In Raja yoga, a soul links with the supreme soul. As a result, the soul gains divine power from the supreme soul which enables the mind to be controlled and the soul to become free from the sense organs. It means the soul becomes self-sovereign and enables us to create elevated actions. That is why it is called Raja yoga, the king of all yogas.


At present, we have lost our original qualities such as divine knowledge, peace, purity, love, happiness and bliss. By practicing Raja Yoga, we can regain our original qualities and become powerful. The soul, the living being is a point of light, the life energy. The soul becomes empowered through Raja yoga practice. By practicing Raja yoga, our life will be changed from a complex to a simple life. Any impurity in the soul in the form of vices such as anger, lust, greed, ego and attachment brings complexity. Complexity brings confusion, insecurity and instability. This will lead to a state of depression. Simplicity is natural and holistic. Originally, our soul has the quality of simplicity. Simple people go beyond happiness and are blissful. Our blissful natural nature automatically brings health and wealth. Hence, we cannot be simple unless we are pure. Any vices or impurity in us will not allow us to be simple. So we have to regain our natural nature of purity and peace. The only method to gain purity is to connect with the supreme soul who is the purifier, who will empower ourselves. When we have the power of purity, we can help others free themselves from stress, tension and confusion.


The first step to Raja yoga is to establish the true identity of the self. Who am I The awareness that I, the soul and not this body will enable us to tune ourselves to the connection from the supreme soul. In the matters of relationship between father and son, wife and husband, lover and beloved or friends among each other, we have observed that the closer one comes to the other, the deeper their awareness of each other and the more widespread their love. In fact, so deeply are they absorbed in thoughts of each other that nothing can stand in the way of their remembering one other. Similarly, the formation of true relationship with the supreme soul, our Supreme Father, which is what we understand by Yoga, is manifested by exclusive absorption in thoughts of him and consequently the constant remembrance of him.


When we stay in connection with the supreme soul, we get empowered and start to spread the vibration of purity, peace and happiness to our surroundings. The atmosphere itself will become peaceful and pure. When we sit in a gathering at least for half an hour and spread these vibrations of peace and purity to the atmosphere through the power of thought, we could remove the suffering of souls who need peace. Similarly, if we could gather together and spread the pure vibration to the flood victims, they will be comfortable and lead their lives happily. Therefore the need of the hour is to bring peace and hope to those who feel hopeless. We have to connect the victimized souls with the supreme soul for a moment and start to donate peace and pure vibrations. While having pure feelings and good wishes for the victims, we are able to donate more vibrations of peace. That is, you have to have positive thoughts that the victims should experience peace and come out of their sorrow to a new beginning with more strength, whilst sending these good wishes and pure feelings, you yourselves are able to visualise the happiness on the faces of your brothers and sisters around the world who are affected in numerous ways due to natural calamities, wars and economic crises.
Only those who enjoy good health both physically and mentally can enjoy a life of happiness with peace of mind.
Conducting a yoga session in this manner is an opportunity for anyone to spread peace to deserving people around the world. On the third Sunday of every month, between 6.30 pm to 7.30 pm, meditation during World Peace Hour is conducted by members of the Brahma Kumaris Raja yoga Centres throught the world.
To mark the third International Day of Yoga this month, the Brahma Kumaries Raja Yoga centres in Sri Lanka are organizing a meditation programme on Sunday, June 18 from 4.30 pm to 7.30 pm for the public under the theme The Ultimate connection, Raja Yoga for a healthy mind and healthy body at the Buddhist Cultural Centre, 32 Sri Sambuddhathwa Jayanthi Mw. Colombo 5. Participants will benefit from a pictorial exhibition, Yoga demonstration, a talk on the theme and will contemplate on the self and donate peaceful vibrations with guided meditation in all three languages. Admission is free.
So let all of us give hope to the hopeless at this time of need by spreading good wishes and pure feelingsBe Holy be Yogi
