MS, RW urged to give Buddhism, the foremost place
	
		 		 
		 
			
The Buddha Sasana Karya Sadhaka Mandalaya comprising of the Maha Sangha and several leading Buddhist organizations have appealed to President Maithripala Sirisena that article 9 of the present Constitution, which ensures that Buddhism be given the foremost place and also guarantees that it is the duty of the state to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana, should be included in the Constitution of Sri Lanka without any amendments.
The proposals presented to the President, the Prime Minister and the Government of Sri Lanka by the Buddha Sasana Karya Sadhaka Mandalaya in order to ensure that the sovereignty, unitary character, and the territorial integrity of Sri Lanka is protected through the Supreme Law of this country.
Even during the British colonial rule, every attempt was made to guarantee the preservation of the Buddha Sasana and our national heritage. Our history is a chronicle that will instil pride in everyone. Language, both Sinhala and Tamil, is the main instrument to bring about understanding, cordiality, and reconciliation among the different communities. Our ancient history is a national heritage that should bring satisfaction to all communities living in this country, the letter said.
Submitting a 15-point proposal the Mandalaya also requested that the National Flag or the National Anthem should not be changed. However, Tamil speaking people may have the right to sing the National Anthem, which is in the 3rd Schedule of the present Constitution (Sinhala version), in the Tamil language, without changing the meaning of its words or its music.

Proposals presented to the President, the Prime Minister and the Government of Sri Lanka by the Buddha Sasana Karya Sadhaka Mandalaya in order to ensure that the sovereignty, unitary character, and the territorial integrity of Sri Lanka is protected through the Supreme Law of this country.
It is the paramount responsibility of all of us to rectify any past lapses on our part when steps are being taken to enact a constitution for the third time since Sri Lanka became a Republic.
In this regard, we consider that it is our responsibility to work amicably within a unitary Sri Lanka without dividing ourselves by ethnicity, religion, or language. It will not be possible to promote reconciliation among ethnic groups, and bring about peace and prosperity if people are to live in separate regions based on ethnicity, religion, or language.
All citizens of Sri Lanka are of equal standing. They have to submit themselves to a single corpus of laws. Laws have to be promulgated by the Parliament of Sri Lanka, which should be the supreme law making body. It is not at all beneficial to divide or separate the country by regions and prepare separate laws. Even in the implementation of laws there should not be any division. 
The most worthwhile task before every one of us today is to develop Sri Lanka as a single, undivided country, rallying under one national flag, and governed by a single legal system.
Even during British colonial rule, every attempt was made to guarantee the preservation of the Buddha Sasana and our national heritage. Our history is a chronicle that will instill pride in everyone. Language, both Sinhala and Tamil, is the main instrument to bring about understanding, cordiality, and reconciliation among the different communities. Our ancient history is a national heritage that should bring satisfaction to all communities living in this country.
Hence, whilst we, the Buddha Sasana Karya Sadhaka Mandalaya, are of the view that it is more appropriate to amend the present constitution in a suitable manner to create the necessary environment for all citizens to bring about amity, understanding, and prosperity, and to accomplish the task of establishing a righteous system of governance for all citizens to live without fear or misgiving in a unitary Sri Lanka, we wish to make the following proposals to the President, the Prime Minister and the Government of Sri Lanka in formulating the new amended constitution.
1. Article 9 of the present Constitution, which ensures that Buddhism be given the foremost place and also guarantees that it is the duty of the state to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana, should be included in the Constitution of Sri Lanka without any amendments.
2. Sri Lanka should remain a unitary state. Supporting, advocating, or encouraging the establishment of a separate state or a federal state should be prohibited by law.
3. The National Flag or the National Anthem should not be changed. However, Tamil speaking people may have the right to sing the National Anthem, which is in the 3rd Schedule of the present Constitution (Sinhala version), in the Tamil language, without changing the meaning of its words or its music.
4. Since both Sinhala and Tamil languages have been recognized as official languages of the state, every citizen shall have the right to transact all business with the Government and the Judiciary in Sinhala or Tamil.
5. The Supremacy of Parliament should be safeguarded. There should be no restrictions or impediments placed on the legislative power of the People, when Parliament exercises such power. If there are any other institutions carrying out any legislative powers, such power should be exercised by them subject to the powers of Parliament. Parliament shall have the right to repeal or amend any legislation in the same manner as the Parliament may amend or repeal its legislation.
6. While Executive power of the People (including Defence) shall be vested with the President and/or the Cabinet as the case may be, any executive powers so exercised by anyone else or by any other institution, should be subject to the directions of the Government of Sri Lanka.
7. No Foreign Government or Foreign Institution should be allowed to exercise judicial power or to interfere in our Judiciary. Provisions should be included in the Constitution guaranteeing the same. There should be no special court or establish any other Constitutional Court above the Supreme Court.
8. No Political or Administrative Unit, based on Race, Religion, or Language should be established within Sri Lanka in as much as amalgamation of Provinces in such a manner is not conducive to peaceful co-existence of communities. The existing provisions provided for amalgamation of provinces or changing their boundaries should be removed from the Constitution. The boundaries of the territory of Sri Lanka or physically annexing Sri Lanka with a neighboring country should not be done for the reason that it is prejudicial to the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka.
9. The office of President, Minister, Member of Parliament, including any office in the Executive, Legislature, or the Judiciary, should be held only by a citizen of Sri Lanka who is not a citizen of any other country. Every such holder of office should be required to take the Oath set out in the 7th Schedule to the present Constitution mutatis mutandis to prohibit the promotion or the establishment of a Federal State.
10. All appointments to high posts in Ministries, Departments, Commissions, Judiciary, or in any other institution should only be made on the recommendation of the Constitutional Council or similar institution created by law, consisting of nominees of recognized political parties proportionately represented therein. All nominations made to such Constitutional Council or institution should be approved by a majority of the Members of Parliament. The President shall not make any appointment to any high post recommended by the Constitutional Council or institution, unless the same is approved by a majority of Members of Parliament. 
11. Police powers and powers relating to law and order of the Republic of Sri Lanka shall not be alienated to any provincial or regional organ. The Sri Lanka Police Force shall be under the Command and Control of the Inspector- General of Police of Sri Lanka who shall be the head of the Sri Lanka Police.
12. All State Land shall be vested in the Republic of Sri Lanka. Utilization, Administration, and distribution of State Land, shall only be done by the Government of Sri Lanka in accordance with the laws made by Parliament.
13. Entering into of all agreements which are injurious or which has a prejudicial effect on Sri Lanka's sovereignty, unitary character, territorial integrity, and national security shall be prohibited, and any such agreement in relation to sovereignty, unitary character, territorial integrity, and national security of Sri Lanka shall only be valid upon the approval of Parliament.
14. Remittance of funds to any Governmental or Non- Governmental institution in Sri Lanka, except through the Government of Sri Lanka made in accordance with the laws of the country, shall be prohibited. Provisions to this effect should be included in the Constitution.
15. The Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Sri Lanka shall not be more than 35, and the allocation of subjects to each such Minister shall be based on a scientific classification. No other Minister shall be appointed other than a maximum of 35 Deputy Ministers.

SL cricket fans escorted from Eden Park by police
	
	Spectators trying to enjoy the New Zealand vs Sri Lanka Twenty20 cricket match at Eden Park seem to have their eyes on something else.
	Twitter and Facebook are rife with accusations security guards are acting as the "fun police" and being too hard on fans, confiscating musical instruments and kicking people out.
	Witnesses have reportedly seen Sri Lankan fans being escorted from the ground by police and security guards.
	In video footage they can be heard booing as security moves in on a group of fans.
	A spectator, who didn't want to be named, said security guards were hanging around a group of Sri Lankan supporters near the boundary. About six of them had been evicted.
	"They seem loud but well behaved and self contained," he said.
	Another spectator, Hayden Eastmond-Mein, said security were being over the top and taking extreme measures.
	"I saw security guards confiscating a number of small drums from Sri Lankan fans," he said. "It seemed really heavy handed and over the top. The big group of Sri Lankans they were targeting were just having a good time and providing most of the atmosphere in what can be a pretty dull stadium"
	To add insult to injury, the half-time entertainment was a group of samba drummers who walked straight past the group of Sri Lankan fans, he said.
	"I don't blame the individual guards, they're obviously just following inflexible rules that are supposedly about safety - but they just serve to make Eden Park a dull, fun-free zone."
	Police communications staff said they did not have any information about the reported incidents. (stuff.co.nz)

SL drops plan to buy fighters from Pak after India objects
	
	Stiff opposition from India has forced Sri Lanka to drop plans, at least for now, to buy JF-17 Thunder fighter aircraft from Pakistan.
	The Indian Sunday Express has learnt that New Delhi shot off a diplomatic missive a few weeks ago to Colombo on why it should not buy the JF-17 Thunder, including a negative technical assessment of the aircraft. It was also pointed out that the countrys defence requirements did not need fighters.
	While questions were raised in Sri Lanka too about the reported $400-million deal, Indias forceful opposition, conveyed through a non-paper, was one of the likely reasons that made Sri Lanka drop the plan for now.
	The Pakistani media were reporting that the deal for JF-17s would be signed during Prime Minister Nawaz Sharifs three-day visit to Colombo which ended Wednesday.
	Despite its own financial crunch, Pakistan was also said to be ready to extend a line of credit to Sri Lanka for the aircraft.
	On Tuesday, Sharif and Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena, who is also the Defence Minister, signed agreements under eight heads in Colombo, but the sale of aircraft was not one of them.
	The Indian government delivered the non-paper  diplomatic parlance for a white sheet of paper without a letterhead or signature  to Colombo at the highest levels about three weeks ago after reports that Pakistan was seriously engaging the Sri Lankan Air Force (SLAF) on the Chinese fighter aircraft to replace the SLAFs ageing fleet of Israeli Kfirs and MiG-27s.
	Pakistan had been pushing for the sale of 10 to 12 JF-17s, each priced about $35 million. Talk of the deal gained ground after a visit to Pakistan by SLAF chief Gagan Bulathsinhala last November. He was invited to send a team to assess the aircraft at the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex (PAC) in Kamra.
	Kamra is where the PAC and Chinas Chengdu Aircraft Corporation (CAC) co-produce the aircraft. But defence experts believe that the aircraft are more or less only assembled at Kamra from readymade Chinese kits. Taking up the Pakistani invitation, a team of Sri Lankan Air Force officials visited Kamra to test the aircraft and run simulation tests.
	New Delhi has opposed SLAF plans to buy the J-17s on the ground that Sri Lanka does not need fighter aircraft. It is six years since the war against the LTTE ended. Since then, Sri Lankas defence spending has increased. For 2016, it is an estimated $3 billion.
	Sri Lankan sources said India also put forth a technical argument that the Russian engines of the JF-17 were not the best, that even China does not use these aircraft. Earlier, some Sri Lankan reports had said India had offered its own Tejas to the SLAF instead.
	India is also concerned that the deal, if it goes through, will enable the PAC, and perhaps even the CAC, to set up a facility in Sri Lanka for maintenance and training, and increase and widen contacts between Pakistan and Chinese security forces and Sri Lanka.
	In 2014, the then Sri Lankan government had cleared a proposal for China to set up a maintenance-cum-servicing facility for its aircraft that are part of the Sri Lankan fleet in Trincomalee. The SLAF has in it fleet the Chengdu F-7 fighter aircraft, and the Y-12 and MA60 transporters. India had raised concerns then about the plan and the Sri Lankan government had said it would be manned only by SLAF personnel. With the change in government, that plan was shelved.

I am afraid of Thilanga because I know his past: Arjuna
	
Responding to newly elected SLC president Thilanga Sumathipalas remarks during a recent media briefing, Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said today that he was afraid of Mr. Sumathipala because of his past.
He said there was a court case against him once for taking an underworld boss named Dhammika Amarasinghe with him to the 1999 Cricket World Cup using Cricket Board funds; and a judge of a court had been forced to bail Mr.Sumathipala out after he was remanded over that incident.
He should have asked himself who he was before pointing fingers at me. When telling him who I am, I should point out that I was not brought up on gambling money. My mother was a teacher and took care of us with the money she earned by doing her job. People still remember what I did for my country. I do not care if one businessman who entered Parliament after being rejected by the people does not remember my services to Sri Lanka. Yes, I lost the SLC election. But I have no regrets because I know that the Sri Lanka Cricket election has been commercialised now, he said.
Speaking of the allegation by Mr. Sumathipala that he had given jobs at the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) to several people during the SLC election campaign, he said the SLPA was not a place where he could give jobs as and when he wished; and added that if he, too, had owned bookmakers, betting centres for horse-racing and a newspaper he might have given jobs to his relatives.
He said he would respond to Mr. Sumathipala's other allegations in court, as he had filed a lawsuit against him. (Piyumi Fonseka)
