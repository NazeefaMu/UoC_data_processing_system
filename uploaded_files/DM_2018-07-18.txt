A confidence that won a gift!
	

The former strongman the other day attended a religious ceremony at a Buddhist temple in a remote corner of the country and a few days after his return to Colombo he received a telephone call from the chief incumbent of that temple.

The monk first thanked the former strongman profusely for being so kind enough to attend the religious ceremony at his temple as the chief guest adding that he had some important thing to confide in him, but was feeling a little hesitant about telling it to him.
Dont hesitate, ape hamuduruwane. Tell me whatever you want to come out with. You have my assurance that I will not either misunderstand you or get mad about it, ape hamuduruwane!, the former strongman told the monk.
Then the monk had opened. This is something strange that happened the day you, Sir, visited our temple You may remember, Sir, that you had tea at our temple. Later I was surprised to hear that the cup you drank tea from, the plate which was used to serve you the short-eats and the bottle you drank water from had gone missing. I had a greater surprise when I heard that a certain person had quietly taken them away and locked them up in a showcase as valuable souvenirs!
The former had greeted this revelation with a loud guffaw.
A report later said that the former strongman had sent an expensive set of chinaware to the temple to serve as a memento of his visit there.

Animal welfare groups fight to bring about humane animal slaughter : Saving a life before the butche
	
They are crammed in trucks, making that one last journey in their life. Cows of all sizes and shapes silently moan as they sense what is yet to happen. As the doors open at the butchers, some are with broken limbs, some have died and some have also given birth. This is the sorry plight of the cattle  those beings that have for centuries supported farmers to plough fields, provided milk to nourish us and dung for manure and drawn overloaded carts for mans benefit.
All animals are sentient beings with a right to life. But today we see the mother cow being killed, sometimes right in front of the baby. Slaughter has become a common practice and the beef trade is in high demand. The laws although are always in
place, have failed to save the lives of these innocent beings as they are always manipulated upon political will. Today, dairy farmers are challenged with debts and cows seem to be a burden for them, thus provoking them to follow alternative ways to find money. However, animal rights activists and welfare groups are fighting to bring about humane slaughter. Hence the Daily Mirror sheds light on the loopholes of the legal process, objectives of the Cattle Protection Trust and the plight of the present day dairy farmers.


Slaughterhouses often operate as charity farms
	Cows under 12 years are also found in slaughterhouses
	
	The government has to pay Rs. 430 billion for dairy farmers
	
	Rs. 50,000 prescribed for slaughtering pregnant and lactating cows 

Laws can legislate for humane slaughterLalani Perera
Speaking to the , Attorney-at-law and animal welfare activist Lalani Perera said that food animals suffer agonizing deaths not only in slaughterhouses, but even in some home backyards. While laws cannot prohibit the consumption of animal flesh, they can legislate for humane slaughter. In some countries the laws require pre-slaughter stunning to render the animal insensitive to pain. But we have no such laws. In 2010, fourteen religious and animal welfare organizations sought court intervention to urge the government to introduce humane slaughter methods. A Cabinet Memorandum for this purpose lay on the table of then Local Government Minister A.L.M. Athaullah for many months. His successor Minister Karu Jayasuriya, was willing to pursue the matter, but could not proceed as he was appointed Speaker. Since then, this is pending before the current Local Government Minister Faiszer Mustapha. Humane slaughter is opposed by a majority of the Muslim community who view it as a threat to their religious practice of Halal slaughter. But humane slaughter does not necessarily contradict Halal slaughter. Our attempts to meet Minister Mustapha have so far failed. The nuanced animal rights campaigner does not fight against any race or religion, but only pleads for the animals welfare. 
Speaking further she said that many engaged in the meat industry want food animals excluded from the proposed Animal Welfare Bill which introduces a comprehensive legal regime to protect all animals. Purportedly claiming that animal cruelty laws will affect Sri Lankas economy, some in the poultry industry demand such exclusion, complacent that it is quite in order to expose animals to brutality for the industrys profit. Slaughterhouses often operate also as charity farms from where animals can be selected for release. Though our Animals Act prohibits the slaughter of cows under 12 years, capable of breeding or fit for agricultural use, such cows are found in slaughterhouses. If those visiting slaughterhouses to save cattle encounter such cows, reporting it to the nearest police station will save many lives, not just one.
As an alternative selecting a place to release cows is crucial, to prevent the animal being re-exposed to slaughter. Giving animals to small scale dairy farmers will help them economically and promote the production of organic fertilizer, Perera added. But, there must be effective monitoring to ensure that these animals are not sold to the butcher when of no use. Perhaps, there may be animal welfare organizations who are willing to engage in monitoring. Due to space constraints to keep released cattle, the then Livestock Minister in 2009, invited those who save cattle to hand them to the National Livestock Development Board to assure them a productive future, but that initiative has not been sustained. Its revival should be considered.

Inadequacy in legal process
Section 4 of the Butchers Ordinance states that no person shall carry on the trade of a butcher, except under the authority of an annual licence or a temporary licence in that behalf, issued by a proper authority. Adding her comments on this regard, Perera reiterated the fact that the Butchers Ordinance enacted in 1893 lays down conditions of slaughter - cattle, goats, pigs and sheep can be slaughtered only with a licence from the local authority and only in licensed slaughterhouses (though temporary licences may be issued for any festival such as Haj where animals can be slaughtered in residential premises). As such, slaughter is prohibited between 6 pm and 6 am; cattle must be exposed for public view for 24 hours prior to slaughter; and 48 hours notice of the intention to slaughter must be given to the local authority. Not only is slaughter of animals in the presence of others awaiting slaughter prohibited, but there is a requirement that all signs of previous slaughter be removed before killing the next animal. But, there are instances where even calves awaiting slaughter witness the mother cow being bludgeoned to death alive. Law enforcement being ineffective, these requirements are observed in the breach.

In 2009, a fine of Rs. 50,000 was prescribed for slaughtering pregnant or lactating cows. It was economic considerations and not compassion to animals that led to this amendment

Section 16 of the Butchers Ordinance states that every licensed butcher who commits a breach of any of the provisions of the four preceding sections shall, upon conviction, be liable to a fine not exceeding one hundred rupees, and in default of payment to imprisonment, either rigorous or simple, for a term not exceeding six months. However, in 2009, a fine of Rs. 50,000 was prescribed for slaughtering pregnant or lactating cows. It was economic considerations and not compassion to animals that led to this amendment. The weakness I see in this amendment is that it does not criminalize such slaughter, but merely prescribes a punishment for its commission, without prohibiting it. When such cows are found in slaughterhouses there should be a presumption that they are there for slaughter, she said.
The enactment of the Animal Welfare Bill, to replace our 1907 Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Ordinance, is totally inadequate to deal with current animal cruelty issues as it has faced severe delays due to lack of political will, bureaucratic apathy and vested interests. The government must give this priority in a context where animals are no longer considered chattel, but globally receiving the status of non-human persons through laws and judicial determinations. Failure to reform our archaic animal cruelty laws will have a negative impact on the image of this nation, whose Constitution gives Buddhism the foremost place and whose current rulers have pledged a Compassionate Government.


Cattle Protection Trust
The Cattle Protection Trust was established in November 2012 by the late attorney general and Presidents Counsel C.R de Silva. Currently headed by his wife Kamalini de Silva, the Trust believes that there is no better way to pay tribute to an animal that has so faithfully served mankind, than to give it shelter in its old age and assure its honourable death.

Once they are produced before courts, the Police then couldnt take them back to their premises. So in most instances we observed the Police are giving them back to the slaughterhouses

The Trust was established under the Public Trustees Ordinance which helps in administration of the Trust. As such a 25-acre block of land was provided by the Mahaweli Authority near the Rambaken Oya scheme at Maha Oya. Speaking to the Daily Mirror Kamalini said that the Trust has formed a sanctuary for cows that are released from slaughter. Once they are produced before courts, the Police then couldnt take them back to their premises. So in most instances we observed the Police giving them back to the slaughterhouses. In order to prevent this practice we initiated this sanctuary and requested the courts to hand over the cows accordingly. Currently there are around 80 cows and we mainly run on donations. We would like to invite well-wishers to support us and in the long run we would like to hand them over to dairy farmers in villages but it has to be supervised. Therefore we invite interested parties to contact us. 


Govt. is provoking dairy farmers to find alternativesNamal Karunarathne
In his comments, National Organiser of the All Ceylon Farmers Federation Namal Karunarathne said that in the Buddhist backdrop, animal slaughter is prohibited. However people have now started to eat meat and this could be anything from rabbits to monitors etc. Similarly to humans, animals too have rights and they need to be respected. We come from a background where we drank cows milk, used its dung in our households as manure and also as a building material. After taking such advantage of the animal, it doesnt seem right to kill and have it for meat. In the recent past there have been several incidents of cattle rustling where the cows head and tail were left and the rest of the body was cut off to be sold to the butcher.
Speaking further he said that the government has to pay a sum of Rs. 430 billion for dairy farmers. They are not paying it and the government is provoking farmers to find alternatives. As farmers are in debt, they see the cow as a burden and the only option is to sell it for meat. Hence its high time that the government starts paying these poor farmers before all cattle are sold for meat.

We hail from a background where we drank cows milk, used its dung in our households

The Daily Mirror on several occasions tried to contact National Livestock Development Board Chairman K. Muthuvinayagam and Ministry of Rural Economic Affairs Secretary D. K Ekanayake but both attempts proved futile.

Appointing Dinesh Opposition Leader: 70 MPs led by JO to meet Speaker today
	
A joint opposition-led coalition of 70 parliamentarians are due to meet Speaker Karu Jayasuriya this afternoon to request the appointment of MP Dinesh Gunawardane as the Opposition Leader in Parliament, an MP said yesterday.
JO National Organiser Dullas Alahapperuma said this was decided at their group meeting which was also attended by 13 MPs of the 16 UPFA MPs who left the government.
Out of the 92 Opposition MPs, 70 are backing MP Dinesh Gunawardane and we will request the Speaker to appoint him as the Opposition Leader and to recognize us as the official opposition in parliament. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has given his blessings in this regard, the MP told Daily Mirror.
He said the future course of action to make the JO the official opposition in parliament would be taken based on the response given by Speaker Jayasuriya to their initial request today (18). (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Buildings not meeting DSA standard to be demolished: DMC
	
The buildings older than 25 years belonging to the State or private, should have to be demolished if they fail in the Detailed Structural Assessment (DSA) Report, Disaster Management Ministry Secretary N.A. Sisira Kumara said.
Speaking to the media yesterday at the ministry he said that most buildings were more than 25 years old.
The decision was taken by the ministry following the recent building that collapsed in Colombo, he said.
If the DSA report on such buildings were negative there are ways to strengthen them to make them suitable for living. If that also cannot be done we have to demolish it, he said.
He said a new law would be enacted in this regard in the near future.
We have identified several buildings that need to be demolished along the coastal line. The decision had been taken for the safety of the people. This law is applicable to all Government and private buildings, Mr Sisira Kumara said.
Speaking at the briefing, Disaster Management State Minister Palitha Range Bandara said laws would be enacted to make it compulsory to obtain reports on agreements from the Disaster Management Centre, Divisional Secretary, Local Government Agents, Road Development Authority, Central Environment Authority, Govijana Seva Department and Agricultural Sectors following all the development in the country.

Cases of Guiltless Executed!
	

The risks of executing the innocent outweigh the reason
	
	Eye for an eye, not the remedy when hangmans noose dangles over our heads

. ... any mans death diminishes me because I am involved in Mankinde, And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee.. John Donne, Meditation: XVII. The list of 18 inmates for execution including pending appeal cases have been submitted to the President. Wele Suda and Susei, accused of continuing business from prisons are included too. The Government will hang them, or instead, will they work on revitalizing our judiciary and law enforcement mechanisms in keeping with the modern scientific approach 
Heroin dealers within civil society members! - Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera 
Mangala Samaraweera, the mature politician donning the crucial Finance and Media Ministry had alleged key members of civil society as the major heroin dealers in Sri Lanka. 
He emphasized that they included some Buddhists Society hierarchy as well. Addressing a media conference at his office, Samaraweera, whose father, Mahanama, the Deputy Minister of Justice in the S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike Government [1956] introduced the Capital Punishment Act No. 20 in Parliament, replacing it with life imprisonment, declared that among those in Welikadas death row as major dealers there were members of civil society organisations. 
Narcotics menace couldnt be eradicated by executions: 
Sasanka Perera of the Committee for Protecting Rights of Prisoners says Courts impose death penalty based on evidence and documents presented by the Police who were famous for obtaining confessions under duress from the suspects. Dr Deepika Udagama, Chairperson, HRC observes that the Capital Punishment as an irrevocable extreme and a form of punishment, which has proven unproductive in curbing crime. 
The Finance Minister emphatically opposed Cabinet Approval and President Maithripala Sirisenas decision to recommence hangmans duty or judicial executions, saying only the second tier traffickers were behind bars at Welikada. However, he will stand by the cabinet decision on the principle of Collective Responsibility 
Running a head office of a Narcotics Hub within the four walls of a prison is not an easy task unless there is substantial protection from Authorities in charge of the premises.
Why Hang the drug dealers only 
Can we also extend this to cover those crooked politicians of past and present who have committed corrupt business deals ignoring tender procedures; corrupt public officials who connive with their political masters in plundering public funds; the unscrupulous elements who syphon out state funds when it suffers from a disastrous economic and financial situations 
Police are famous for prosecuting criminals who have committed crimes but they think cannot be proved in a court of law due to lack of evidence by charging them under possession of a packet of kudu, a commodity available in the station as productions. 
A businessman who once visited his drivers house got an idea after enjoying a cup of tea served by his beautiful wife. A few days later the Police caught the driver with a packet of kudu and got him remanded for two weeks, within which period the boss visited the victims family to inquire about the well-being of the young wife and his little kid. 
In the Police force of 85,000, it is quite possible, as in any other organisation for a few unscrupulous characters to exist too. 
There had been quite a few cases recorded in the annals of the Judiciary, both here and abroad, where innocents were condemned to execution due to fallacies in the legal procedure. 
Since 1992 in the United States, DNA evidence has helped the exoneration of more than a dozen condemned to death. A publication by Death Penalty Information Centre provides a list of ten innocent people executed. The study reveals one in every 25 or four per cent punished are innocent. 
We in Sri Lanka lacks such sophisticated apparatus or technical know-how to trace forensic evidence using DNA tests of past cases. In all developed nations where such advanced methodology is practised, they have made shocking revelations in this regard. 25-Year Imprisonment of Innocent 
On Sep 21, 2008, Adrian Thomas was convicted for the murder of his son, four-month-old Matthew and was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. 
The infant was rushed to the hospital by Adrian after finding him insensitive. During the questioning, investigators notified him that it had been established the child passed away from blunt force trauma and that they made out someone in the family had done it. They intimidated to detain his wife if he did not plead guilty. 
This interrogation technique is called the Reid Technique, which is a nine-step process used by most Police officers in America. 
The technique to get a confession out of Thomas was subject to severe criticism. [--Police Science in the Interrogation Room: Seventy Years of Pseudo-Psychological Interrogation Methods to Obtain Inadmissible Confessions --Hastings Law Journal: Vol. 61]

A retired SSP ran a social service organization to help poor and down-trodden people were convicted of raping an eleven-year-old girl-servant some 15-20 years ago. The convict met a father-daughter pair who approached him for some financial assistance at his centre: after a long chat, the father suggested to the SSP to take the motherless girl to his bungalow as a domestic helper for he was unemployed. 
The father who frequented the masters house to collect money for his booze witnessed the daughter, instead of doing house chores, was learning English from the master. When it became a real nuisance, the father was asked to take back the child. This prompted the man to try a dirty trick on the retired Policeman. 
He blackmailed him by claiming that the girl had been raped and that legal action would be instituted if he failed to make a handsome compensation package as ransom. The 65-year old ex Police officer, a father of two educated and well-employed son and a daughter and a grandfather too had little options. 

Adrian was convicted based on his own confession. It was later established that the cause of death was Sepsis. Thomas was exonerated after spending the first six years of his term in jail. What if he was executed

Medical evidence favoured the prosecution that the victim has been repeatedly raped over a period. All attempts by the well-connected and highly influential man to explain his innocence to authorities were in vain as the strong NGO based Women and child protection civil groups and HR organisations lobbying for his blood became more effective. 
They created an unprecedented voice at the national level, with media playing their usual role. Backing by volunteers from the legal fraternity enhanced the campaign for the public to react against the law enforcement authorities for the delay in arresting the rapist. School children were instigated and mobilised making each child send a postcard addressed to The President requesting stern action against the criminalPolice had no alternative but arrest, prosecute and get their former colleague remanded. 
The unfortunate girl was trained or rather brainwashed by the self-proclaimed For a Few Dollars More.. type activists, that she gave evidence in open court describing with clarity, word by word, the specific details of how the crime was committed on her by the suspect. Her story was accepted by everybody who followed the case including the writer, without creating an iota of doubt. People hailed the verdict of jail term; some wanted him hanged too, while the then religious leaders comprehended the matter with equanimity and refrained from commenting. 
The benevolent senior gentlemen, a highly respected, virtuous man who earned a reputation for his integrity, honesty, gentleness and calm disposition remained in the hearts and minds of former colleagues and subordinates in the service, who held him in high esteem, who were hesitated and resisted prompt action, which delayed legal process.

Death penalty: Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith clarifies
	
The Archbishop of Colombo, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith today clarifying his statement on the Government moves to implement the death penalty, said that what he meant was that the State should not bring back the death sentence, but that criminal minds that sought to destroy social peace and harm hundreds should not go unpunished.
The criminal minds that sought to destroy social peace and harm hundreds of others, putting into ridicule law and order, and challenging humanity, to stop them if possible and that they should not go unpunished for their criminal behaviour, even after being condemned.Our youth are too precious to be sacrificed on the altar of philosophical sophistry and arguments. It would be like Nero playing the fiddle while Rome burned," Cardinal Ranjith said in a statement.
The clarification as follows:
Neither have I advocated a re-introduction of the death penalty carte blanche as people seem to have understood nor have I desired to close my eyes and do nothing before this terrible phenomenon our country is faced with at present which causes death and violence in the streets and the destruction of the cream of our youth who become drug addicts at an age as early as their adolescence being exposed to drugs even in their schools. This is being done by drug cartels operated at times from the prisons. That was the concern and context of my statement.
Hundreds of parents have approached our clergy and expressed their horror at what happened to some of their children. Several cases of suicide by youth consuming drugs have been reported to us. The Archdiocese in fact organized two protest marches against drug peddlers in Ragama and in Negombo with thousands of our faithful participating and I have listened to the tearful tales of so many mothers whose families have been rendered destitute by the drug menace. Should we wash hands like Pilate and wait till our children are destroyed.
The Holy Father Pope Francis has in fact not accepted the death penalty which is also my own position invariably. I am not for a generalized return of capital punishment. It should be the last option, if at all.
In fact the Catechism of the Catholic Church states that: "Assuming that the guilty party's identity and responsibility have been fully determined, the traditional teaching of the Church does not exclude recourse to the death penalty, if this is the only way of effectively defending human life against the unjust aggressor" [Catechism of the Catholic Church, revised edition, 1997 No. 2267].
Thus, I have acted on this matter with a sense of total awareness of the gravity of this situation, in faithfulness to what my faith teaches me on the matter and in consideration of the tragedy that continues to strike our youth and the nation and my responsibility before God and our people in addressing this serious national issue. May I also refer to what Jesus, the Lord, mentioned with regard to those who cause scandal and mislead our children and youth in order to gain filthy lucre for themselves: "It would be better for you, if a millstone were hung around your neck and you were thrown into the sea than for you to cause one of these little ones to stumble" [Lk.17:2].
My point is that the State should not bring back the death sentence, but that criminal minds that seek to destroy social peace and harm hundreds of others putting into ridicule law and order and challenging humanity to stop them if possible, should not go unpunished for their criminal behaviour even after being condemned. Our youth are too precious to be sacrificed on the altar of philosophical sophistry and arguments. It would be like Nero playing the fiddle while Rome burned.

END OF CIVILITY, BARRACKS : MODEL OF POLITICS AND MILLENNIUMS CHILDREN
	

The recent Friday Forum statement signed by distinguished scholars and retired civil servants, condemns a personal attack by retired Rear Admiral Sarath Weerasekara on Dr. Deepika Udagama, Chairperson of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL)Weerasekara denounced Dr. Udagama as an LTTE supporter and a traitor to this country, with the battle cry death to traitors. The recent denunciation of Dr. Udagama as an apologist for the LTTE, is symptomatic of this vicious culture of denigration.
A similar statement signed by 54 university academics gives more detail:
It has been many months now since a certain group of individuals, led by ex-military personnel, had proclaimed before the media that individuals who were supportive of a new Constitution ought to be considered as traitors acting against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka. Such individuals, it was further stated, ought to be held accountable for their traitorous acts in a court of law and punished with death and that action will be taken against them at a future date when a new political leadership assumes power
A weekly Sinhala newspaper of June 29, 2018 carried a page 1 lead story with the headline Traitors Should be Given the Death Penalty under a Patriotic Government. The story, illustrated with photographs of two senior ex-military officers, opens as follows: 

At a Viyath Maga seminar in Gampaha, a senior ex-Army officer elaborated the death threat more widely, specifically recommending the JVPs restricted funeral rites  of the 80s terror

The Sinhala Alt-Right has abandoned all sense of civility. The fascistization of language and manners, of discourse, reflects the fascistization of thought, and prefigures the fascistization of politics and governance

Under a patriotic government [he shall] call for those who engaged in all treacherous deeds to be given the death penalty, said Dr. Weerasekara. He was speaking yesterday, June 28, at a media briefing in Rajagiriya organized by the Federation of National Organizations. Sarath Weerasekara went on to addA woman called Deepika Udagama functions as the head of the Human Rights Commission. She is a person who gets together with NGOs and speaks on behalf of the Tigers. 
Sometime last year, on a private TV channel, Sarath Weerasekara threatened fellow panellist Jehan Perera with the death penalty for treason. At a Viyath Maga seminar in Gampaha, a senior ex-Army officer elaborated the death threat more widely, specifically recommending the JVPs restricted funeral rites of the 80s Terror. Their preferred Presidential candidate had spoken on the occasion but had left when this was said. At the same venue, an entrepreneurial heiress called for guns to be stuck in the mouths of traitors and discharged. The Sinhala Alt-Right has abandoned all sense of civility. The fascistization of language and manners, of discourse, reflects the fascistization of thought, and prefigures the fascistization of politics and governance. Already, the ethos of the Sinhala Right is that of fascism.
What do you call a situation in which the man who makes legalistic death threats against the Chairperson of the Human Rights Commission, also organized nothing less than the foreign policy workshop of the think-tank of a probable presidential candidate at the Shangri-La conference and is currently drafting a major foreign policy document for that think-tank What do you call a regime in which officers and gentlemen who make such threats hope to be law-makers or influential elements; a regime under which such threats will be sought to be made law by them 
If a senior ex-military officer can make death threats when he is still in Opposition, what will he and those like him not do when in power And if he can threaten prominent national personalities with death sentences, what can a regime animated by this same spirit of angry resentment, not do to students, workers, and peasants engaging in protest or mere dissent, and to the media which reports such criticisms And what may such a regime do to non-Sinhala Buddhists
For the first time in our history, we stand on the brink of the assumption of state power by Fascism. Ideas and persons rightly relegated to the lunatic fringe in past decades have crawled out of the woodwork and from under rocks, and entered mainstream discourse, rendering it highly toxic, even rabid. These forces hope to capture state power at the next Presidential elections through a candidate they can identify most closely with. They hope to assume power initially by electoral methods, but install a barracks and temple model of politics; a fanatical Sinhala-Buddhist military rule. 
The Alt-Right leadership and sundry ideologues have already legitimized Fascism by brushing away objections to the (nationally televised) use of the H word-- Hitler. Thus, all universal norms, limits and parameters have been preemptively dispensed with in favour of narrowly nativist religio-cultural prescriptions which substitute hierarchical deference and inherited tradition for the universal principle of equality. 

These forces hope to capture power at the next Presidential polls through a candidate they can identify most closely with and hope to assume power by electoral methods, but install a barracks and temple model of politics; a fanatical Sinhala-Buddhist military rule

It has been 70 years of accumulated Sinhala-Buddhist ultra-nationalist resentment and rancor, since the debate over the character and definition of the Ceylonese/Lankan state and society was decided upon in an intelligent, realistic manner. An emblematic encounter was that of a Buddhist student delegation led by Prof. GP Malalasekara, who failed utterly to convince DS Senanayaka to declare independent Ceylon a Sinhala-Buddhist state. The strategically sagacious PM, a Sinhalese and Buddhist (and pioneering Smart patriot), countered that such an assertion would assist the minorities in counter-assertion, and in the South Asian region and the world, they vastly outnumbered the Sinhala-Buddhists (who were only six million at the time). 

MR must either be released from the fetters that prevent him from running for President or motivated to make the right choice of a non-polarizing, progressive-populist proxy candidate. The UNP must be prevailed upon to choose as leader and candidate, the populist who can retrieve the partys Sinhala vote-base.

Another project is to turn the clock back to before July 1987, the Indo-Lanka Accord and the 13th amendment. Universal Human Rights and the UN will be junked in favor of self-referential cultural superiority and neo-isolationist unilateralism. It is a nightmarish narcissism, incubated for decades. The Sinhala Alt-Right isnt similar to Vladimir Putin, but to Vladimir Zhirinovsky!


The Alt-Right fantasy is to move beyond the numerical preponderance and political advantage that the Sinhalese enjoy in a democracy. The fear is that the Sinhalese will be divided in the democratic game and that the minorities will thus prevail. The political Final Solution to the problem of competitive democracy is a permanent Sinhala-Buddhist dictatorship through (I) the Constitutional re-inscription of Sri Lanka as a Sinhala-Buddhist state and (II) the installation of a Bhikkhu-dominated, patriarchal Sinhala-Buddhist military regime with an elected civilian faade/human shield. 
The New Right ideology has no respect for elected democratic representatives of the people, the Democratic Political Movement, process and institutions. They have no respect for politics and the political. They regard political struggle as inferior to war, political experience to military experience, and political leaders to ex-military men. The Far Right regards the military command-and-control model as superior to politics. This would come as a shock to Mao who declared politics in command, saying the correctness or incorrectness of the political line decides everything. If politics is so inferior a vocation, why then seek national political leadership
In a Far Right dispensation the Cabinet will be dominated by hawkish ultra-nationalist ex-military officers who either receive nomination or are inducted through the National List. Civilian democratic politicians including Mahinda Rajapaksa will be reduced to figureheads and hostages. 
Another project is to turn the clock back to before July 1987, the Indo-Lanka Accord and the 13th amendment. Universal Human Rights and the UN will be junked in favor of self-referential cultural superiority and neo-isolationist unilateralism. It is a nightmarish narcissism, incubated for decades. The Sinhala Alt-Right isnt similar to Vladimir Putin, but to Vladimir Zhirinovsky!
The fascist future cannot be avoided by entrenchment in a liberal ideological comfort zone, the status quo. A multi-pronged strategy is needed, shaping and channeling change. MR must either be released from the fetters that prevent him from running for President or motivated to make the right choice of a non-polarizing, progressive-populist proxy candidate. The UNP must be prevailed upon to choose as leader and candidate, the populist who can retrieve the partys Sinhala vote-base. 
The world community has a vested interest in deterring a confrontational, sharply polarizing outcome. China, above all, has no interest in being drawn into the trap of an ethno-religious quagmire on Indias doorstep. 
Resistance to militarist ethno-fascism will devolve upon the university-educated, rational-secular, anti-racist radical, modernist-militant youth and students. The responsibility for the future will shift from The Children of 56 (the original phrase was my fathers) to The Millenniums Children.

An edict issued by a khakied top brass to his subordinates in a key division had left them flabbergasted, they say.

According to this unprecedented edict, the sleuths attached to this division are required when it comes to enforcing the law against some select people, to treat even some minor civil offences alleged to have been committed by them as serious criminal offences.
The subordinates fear to explain to this high up the possible repercussions they could face in the future for twisting the law because he would not tolerate any negative response from them.
The subordinates would discuss in hushed tones among themselves the injustice they are compelled to suffer, but would dare not openly complain, for fear of reprisals, they say.

Henarathgoda Railway Station : An archaeological value of more than one and a half centuries
	

The Colombo-Kandy hill-country railway line completes 165 years on 3rd August 2018 since its commencement on 3rd August 1853 by the English Governor Sir Henry Ward. Among the other railway stations, one of the main railway stations that begun its construction between Colombo and Kandy is the Henarathgoda Railway station. 
The Europeans started to strengthen their commercial power by spreading their religion and going in search of spices, while being engaged in exploratory journeys since 1400 A.D. with the emergence of the European renaissance. It was the British who arrived in Sri Lanka after the Portuguese and Dutch. After the capturing of Sri Lanka by the British, they began to focus their attention on the plantation economy. Accordingly, by 1870, the main source of income in Sri Lanka was coffee, and all economic activities had depended on the coffee industry.

The Europeans started to strengthen their commercial power by spreading their religion and going in search of spices, while being engaged in exploratory journeys since 1400 A.D. with the emergence of the European renaissance

However, the transport of coffee to Colombo, by that time, was difficult through hill-country routes and heavy fog. Therefore, it was essential to introduce profitable as well as quick methods of dispatching coffee to Colombo. Then, the planters in Sri Lanka had pointed out the necessity of building railway lines to the British rulers who had already started to construct railway lines in many European countries. The planters had thought the coffee industry would collapse if proper railway facilities were not available from the estate sector to dispatch coffee at cheaper prices. 
With this objective in mind, the protest campaign that was reported for the first time in Sri Lanka was that of the planters. As a result of this protest, the construction of the railway line between Colombo and Kandy was entrusted with the British East India Trading Company. Marking the historic even of constructing this line, the Governor Henry Ward had cut the first sod of soil on 3rd August 1858. However, this construction was stopped abruptly in 1861 as its expenditure seemed to be excessive.
Later, the British government itself decided to commence its work and its construction was commenced in 1863.It was on December 27, 1864 that the first railway transport was begun after completion of the railway line. Prince Babent, the inheritor to the throne of Belgium, who arrived in Sri Lanka, travelled in the special train from Colombo to Ambepussa. In this way, with the commencement of the railway line between Colombo and Kandy in 1867, railway travel started between Colombo and Kandy. 

Only foot paths had lain through the dense forests in the place where Gampaha town was located during the period of governor Edward Barnes

The documents belonging to the colonial period bear evidence that the clearing of the dense jungles in Gampaha was started after 1815, during the period of Sir Edward Barnes who was the fifth British governor in Sri Lanka. It is mentioned that the Governor Edward Barnes who had participated on the occasion of starting the Colombo-Kandy railway line construction in 1825, had arrived in Gampaha as well. 
Only foot paths had lain through the dense forests in the place where Gampaha town was located during the period of governor Edward Barnes. The bullock carts loaded with coffee had travelled using lanterns, from Kandy to Colombo, and the resting place that had been used by the carters is known as Miriswatta at present. 
The Englishmen had taken steps to establish a jungle park as a resting place in Henarathgoda area that had been used by the English travellers who travelled by train. However, the Henarathgoda railway station was established by the English rulers for the Englishmen to go after enjoying the beauty of the park and resting.



After completion of the Colombo-Kandy railway station within six years, a train which ran along this line had stopped at Henarathgoda railway station for the first time when it was completed on December 27, 1864. The villagers in Henarathgoda and suburbs were surprised at the sight of this train for the first time. 
With the passage of time, Henarathgoda park had been transformed into a botanical garden. Then, the present name of Henarathgoda became Gampaha which is a densely populated town today. The main mode of transport at that time was train transport, because there was no public bus service.
At present, the main town of the administrative district is known as ( Henarathgoda ) Gampaha where there is a population of about 2,300,000 with the opening of the gates of development. 
Therefore, the Department of Archaeology has gazetted this place as a site with archaeological importance by conserving it so that the future generation could admire this historic place.
Let this historic place live long for the good of the future generations.

At present, the main town of the administrative district is known as ( Henarathgoda ) Gampaha where there is a population of about 2,300,000 with the opening of the gates of development.

IT JUST NEVER ENDS!!!
	
The reason the crime rate never decreases in this country is that there are no punishments fitting the crimes. Every man or woman who commits a crime in this country can be assured of REMAND!!! FREE BOARD AND LODGING AT THE EXPENSE OF YAHALPALANA!!! When the Government has to spend so much money feeding all these criminals, is it any wonder they dont have money left for the more progressive things that need to be done!!! The other consistent practice is a postponement, no matter what the offence, it is not dealt with!!! Hearings, custody cases, bail bonds, postponements, it just goes on and on!!! Is the Judiciary of this country that incompetent that it cannot deal with a case and bring it to completion We are told that the High Court is to begin sittings sometime in July!!! WHY NOT IMMEDIATELY TRIAL-AT-BAR TO HEAR HIGH PROFILE CASES ON FINANCIAL FRAUD ETC. TO COMMENCE SOON!!! NEVER IS ANYTHING DONE RIGHT AWAY, IT IS A CONSTANT PROCESS OF PROCRASTINATION!! WHY The Minister of Justice says the crime rates are declining; she must be missing the Headlines!!!

Death is right for the drug
The leopard killers are given bail, Arjuna has three cell phones and five SIM cards in his cell; 10 million worth of liquor, hashish and cannabis found in a container!!! PTL has given 5 mn to Ravi K, but he just didnt take it, they are such open boards of corruption that all suspects, including those involved in the Bond Scam, deny it
all!!! Global Transportation and Logistics was the recipient this time!!! Murders everywhere, husbands killing wives, humans killing humans at the slightest provocation and THE PRESIDENT STILL MULLS OVER THE DEATH SENTENCE; THIS SHOULD NOT BE ONLY FOR DRUG OFFENDERS  WHAT ABOUT MURDERERS Why are people continuing
to deal in drug trafficking even from prison Cant this government realize that it is because they are certain the only punishment meted out to them will be to be thrown into prison again!!! Has the government made inquiries to ascertain who in the prisons are helping these people with their drug trafficking THE DEATH SENTENCE WOULD INDEED BE A HUGE DETERRENT TO ALL THESE WRONGDOERS!!! WHY THE HESITATION THEN!!!


No resolution on anything
Now we are told the Draft of the New Constitution could be expected next week!!! Please note could be!!! It was the outgoing American Ambassador who was the first to suggest that we should put a New Constitution in place!!! Parliament continually institutes so many Constitution-making processes that it has become difficult to keep up with what is happening; particularly as there seems to be no RESOLUTION TO ANYTHING!!! An institution of a New Constitution will pave the way for more economic benefits!!! Our morons cannot see or refuse to see the benefit of that!!!

Look after the hoi polloi
The Government Clerical Services have protested against salary anomalies  well done; but what will the outcome be Will the government take heed and do something substantive about their grievances We wonder!!! The white-collar worker can protest but what of the POOR MAN WHO CARES ABOUT THE POOR WORKER, THE REALLY POOR, WHO HAVE TO DO SUCH HARD LABOUR, SUCH MENIAL WORK AND YET GET PAID ONLY A PITTANCE!!! With the cost of living what it is today, petrol, diesel prices up, vegetable prices up, how does the poor man exist To whom does he complain and if he does, who cares
I was shocked recently, absolutely shocked when I happened to overhear a conversation between an HRD EXECUTIVE AND ANOTHER MAN, WITH THE HR GUY BOASTING THAT HIS PEON IS PAID A SALARY OF RS. 11,000/- AND WITH OVERTIME HE GETS RS. 18,000/-!!! IN THE NAME OF ALL THAT IS HOLY, HOW IS A POOR MAN EXPECTED TO EXIST AND TO FEED HIS FAMILY ON A PITTANCE LIKE THAT
ISNT ANYONE INTERESTED, DOESNT ANYONE CARE Assuming he gets Rs. 18,000/- how can he feed his family, pay his bills, clothe himself and his family and attend to other basic, absolutely basic necessities on a pittance like that
Doesnt anyone care; to whom does a poor labourer, driver or worker complain Cant the government bring in some legislation to ensure that these poor people get A DECENT LIVABLE WAGE IS THAT TOO MUCH TO EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT TO DO After all, it is the VOTE of these poor people, that bring them into power, so why cant they ensure that a proper livable wage is paid to them Most of the time, the high powered executives are paid such astronomical salaries, so naturally, it is the poor man who suffers!!! The major concern of any government should be the hoi polloi, the common man; he is the most important deciding factor in any election!!! One man has had the guts to ask the government to Introduce a Formula to Increase Salaries as Well!!! Since the government implements various asinine formulas, it would do well to introduce a formula, on a regular basis, to increase the salaries of the Public and Private Sector employees so that the poor man can at least look forward to a decent living wage!!!

ISNT ANYONE INTERESTED, DOESNT ANYONE CARE Assuming he gets Rs. 18,000/- how can he feed his family, pay his bills, clothe himself and his family and attend to other basic, absolutely basic necessities on a pittance like that

Missing: integrity, honesty
It would be futile for us to even begin to think that businesses are not affected by lack of governance!!! THE MIRROR BUSINESS says and I quote: Declining ethics, morals blamed for businesses going behind politicos!!! In a nutshell, the Shippers Council is saying that they have to depend on excessive political lobbying but even that has failed due to decline and demise of ethics and morals such integrity and honesty!!! WHERE IN THIS COUNTRY CAN WE LOOK FOR INTEGRITY AND HONESTY The Chairman laments and we do too, that though this question has been raised on many platforms, our column included, NOTHING HAS CHANGED!!! We are asking China to send in spares and equipment for various projects, China to fund a Convention Centre and perhaps many others which we are not even aware of!!! SO WHERE DOES OUR COUNTRY STAND OR WILL IT STILL BE LEFT STANDING

Stuck in a quagmire
Patchwork will not do when what is actually called for is a complete overhaul!!! One of the reasons why our lives remain untouched, unreformed and unchanged is because we are stuck in the quagmire of unwilling, disinclined and incapable politicians who refuse to break away from this established constricting structure that contains and constrains us and take measures to totally rebuild and renew!!! We are told that the secret to success is to subject your ego and serve others!!! The opposite is true here; our politicians are elected TO BE SERVED NOT TO SERVE, NEVER HEARD OF IT!!! GRIPPED AS THEY ARE BY THE DEMONS OF POWER, POSITION AND PRESTIGE, IT WOULD NOT BE POLITICALLY EXPEDIENT IF TRUTH BECAME A VICTIM TO POLITICS!!!

It was good riddance for her!
	

This fair purohita hailing from Rajarata handling affairs relating to women and children is said to be looking for a Diyawanna member of her own gender to have her as her deputy.

This post fell vacant when the incumbent was compelled to quit it on the heels of a furore that erupted due to a highly controversial statement she made in public.
By the way, this fair purohita had not been on the best of terms with that fair one who had to go for making the unholy statement, when she was sharing the work with her in a deputy capacity.
Therefore, it was a welcome development for the purohita, when the deputy one called it quits, amidst the din of rebukes and she is bent on getting a deputy she likes appointed without the least delay lest the former one by any chance making a comeback to resume the innings.
Therefore, the fair purohita has already recommended a fair Diyawanna member from Sabaragamuwa for appointment as her deputy and has also launched a campaign to canvass support for her.
However, a rumour afloat in Green circles says chances that her nominee being appointed to fill the vacancy are very remote given that she is a newcomer to Diyawanna and too green for the job.
So, the chances are that the fair purohita will again get as her deputy someone whom she may not like, they say.

Kerala ganja smuggling: Govt. to curb menace together with India
	
In the wake of an increase in activities involving Kerala ganja smuggling, the government is planning to engage the Indian authorities to curb the menace, a Minister said yesterday.
Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara told Daily Mirror yesterday that the government would hold talks with India to seek the support of its law enforcement authorities to deal with the problem.
The Minister said the police seized 4,660 kilos of Ganja last year, and a bulk of them was Kerala Ganja.
We seized 2,721 kilos of Ganja during the first half of this year, he said.
He said 24,581 suspects were arrested this year in connection with Ganja and Kerala Ganja smuggling.
Kerala Ganja is smuggled into the country through the northern coast of the country. Jaffna is the worst hit area.
We intend to initiate dialogue with the Indian authorities to get their assistance. We need their help in identifying witnesses needed in our local investigations into smuggling activities, he said. (Kelum Bandara)

Mervyn Samaranayake passed away on July 18 in 1990. I write this with much feeling. 
A feeling of happiness for the beautiful memories we have of him. Feelings of sadness as he is no more with us to share lifes joys and sorrows. He was the son of the late W.H. Samaranayake the author of Practical English, founder and former Principal of St. Bernadettes College, Polgahawela. He hailed from a distinguished family. He was loved and admired by all and was a silent social worker. His devotion to duty was unique. He was a staunch member of the Roman Catholic Church and no believer of caste, creed or colour. Men of the stamp, mettle and genius of the calibre of the late Mervyn Samaranayake are indeed rare today.
He was blessed with two children. May God Almighty grant him eternal rest!
Twenty eight years ago on this sad day,
The one we loved was called away,
God took him home, it was His will,
But in our hearts he lives still.

However, the man from the central hills has not severed ties with the former strongman either, they say.

JO ranks.
The former strongman had then asked him why he was keeping away despite having played the main matchmaker role in the recent past.
The man known for his quick wit had explained that he was keen on joining the JO along with Wayamba Malli who was a little bit hesitant and he proposed to cross the floor with Malli the moment the latter made up his mind to accompany him.

Pulimood Memorial Oration A birthday tribute to a Principal par excellence An annual event organis
	
An annual feature in the Old Girls Association (OGA) calendar is the Susan George Pulimood Memorial Oration held every year on the 23rd of July to commemorate the birthday of Mrs. Pulimood who served Visakha Vidyalaya as Principal for 22 long years  laid the visionary foundations and her dedication led to Visakha being established as a Super Grade school. She opened new doors for young Buddhist women hitherto restricted to the home sciences, by introducing the Science section.
An eminent past Visakhian who has distinguished herself in her chosen profession, is selected each year to deliver the oration. 
This year the oration will be delivered by Prof. Niranjanie Ratnayake (nee Kodikara ) (BSc Eng (Hons) (Cey), MEng (Wales),Chartered Engineer FIESL., Member IEPSL, Emeritus Professor, Department of Civil Engineering, University of MoratuwaPresident, Institution of Engineers Sri Lanka, President Elect, Institute of Environmental Professionals Sri Lanka)The oration under the theme Breaking Barriers and Changing the World  Women in Engineering will be delivered at the Jeremias Dias Hall, at Visakha Vidyalaya.The Trust also awards scholarships annually to students achieving academic excellence based on their performance at the GCE A/L examination in the Science (Bio & Physical), Arts and Commerce streams.The Pulimood Trust is sustained by the generous contributions made by the old girls and with their support the event had been continued uninterrupted for the past 27 years.
Synopsis of the Oration to be delivered by Prof. Niranjanie Ratnayake.Breaking Barriers and Changing the World  Women in EngineeringGender stereotyping has been an ongoing practice in both the developed as well as developing world since time immemorial. Whilst some conservative cultures strictly enforce a differentiation between males and females in education, employment, and social freedom; even in the more liberal cultures, stereotyping is still apparent from the day a child is born. Girls are dressed in pink dresses with bows and ribbons, expected to play with dolls, and are seen to be timid and weak; whereas boys are dressed in blue, expected to play with trucks and trains, and often complimented for being tough and rough. Boys should fix things while girls need things fixed. As girls grow up, they are expected to be beautiful, graceful, soft spoken, and cultured, whereas boys will be handsome, outspoken, and strong. Boys are expected to be strong in science and mathematics and girls strong in the Arts. Even if the girls do get into science, they may study medicine or biological sciences, but rarely engineering. Boys will become Surgeons, Engineers, and Pilots, whereas girls will stay at home as housewives or take up jobs like nurses, primary teachers or secretaries. This is the typical stereotyping of roles given to boys and girls by society. 
Since my childhood days, I have always challenged these stereotypes. Looking back at my time spent at this prestigious institution, I can see how my own views and attitudes were formed and influenced by strong female role models who also challenged societys lazy stereotyping of how a woman should live her life. Our schools founder, Mrs. Jeremias Dias, after whom this hall I address you incidentally is named, and Susan George Pulimood who I honour with my oration, were not only pioneers in the advancement of girls education in Sri Lanka, but were in their own right tremendously successful bonafide specialists in their fields of running a top class educational institution for girls, helping them to break the barriers imposed by a patriarchal society.
I speak to you today as a Professor Emeritus in Civil Engineering of the University of Moratuwa, as well as the current President of the Institution of Engineers Sri Lanka. I was the first female to achieve this combination, but I am hopeful I am merely the start of a long line of many more to come. To become an Engineer, as women, we have to break these social barriers I mentioned previously. Female Engineers have been coined double stereotype breakers; the stereotype for a good woman as well as that for a good engineer. Family and school support is extremely important for any girl taking this step. Visakha Vidyalaya has always empowered girls to take on challenges and do what they are best at, not being confined to stereotypes. This foundation helps a girl to confidently enter a male dominated field and still be a good woman; beautiful, graceful, eloquent, and cultured. 
We become engineers because we get excited about solving problems and making things happen, by design. Engineers change the world  We improve human life by catering to the needs of society, providing solutions to facilitate everything from basic human necessities such as shelter, food, and water to transportation, clothing, and medical equipment to fancy extravaganzas like Trevitas and Lamborghinis. We help advance cultures through providing platforms for entertainment and communication. We conceptualize solutions, design them, and implement them. We also design and implement others concepts, collaborating with architects, doctors, and scientists to create buildings, medical equipment, and laboratories. Engineers at NASA are working hand in hand with astronauts right now, designing and implementing their concepts for space travel to another planet! This list is endless. Without engineers, these concepts would remain merely as ideas. It is the engineers role to design safe and functional solutions to all kinds of problems faced by others, and bring them to life. That is how Engineers are changing the world. I do not see being a woman as a handicap for being an engineer. Gaining the right skills and having the passion for what you are doing are the important factors to be successful as a female in engineering. 
I wish people would stop being impressed by the fact that Im a Woman Engineer. We want it to be normal to see beautiful, social, intelligent women out there that are engineers 
This statement by Stacey DelVecchio, Past President, Society of Women Engineers, USA, nicely sums up the sentiment most of us women engineers feel at work as well as when we meet people socially.
To all the parents and teachers in the audience, I urge you to help your daughter and pupil to find her passion, be it Engineering, Business, Surgery, or anything in between, encourage her to break all barriers she comes across, and not let stereotyping stop her from changing the world into a better, more beautiful, peaceful and happy place to live in.

## Title: Questionable Donation from CICT
## Section: Expose

Questionable Donation from CICT
	

This issue has raised many questions like why CICT generously donated such a huge amount of money to a charity
	
	The donation had been remitted to Pushpa Rajapaksa Foundation by CICT through The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (cheque No. 594691) to the Foundations account (No. 204-1-001-5-0003290) maintained at Peoples Bank
	
	As the money for this donation too had been documented as construction costs, the taxpayers are forced to bear a certain percentage of this amount
	
	But nowhere in the world is a donation that was made considered as a construction cost
	
	According to the view of the Auditor General, this accounting treatment is not acceptable and this has been mentioned in the audit query that we have sent to you on November 27, 2016
	
	Action has to be taken against both these former officials for aiding and abetting the Rajapaksas to solicit a commission

Following the revelations made by the New York Times as to how China Habour Engineering Company contributed money towards Mahinda Rajapaksas 2015 re-election during the presidential campaign, further details have now emerged. This is how Colombo International Container Terminals Limited (CICT) had donated to a fund of a different memberin the Rajapaksa family in 2012.

Although CICT in a press release, last week, reiterated that the payment they made was a donation in good faith, and a part of their commitment towards their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programme, the is now in possession of a set of documents which indicates otherwise and how the donor company  CICT -does not intend to answer any of the questions this newspaper posed to them with regard to the said payment. 
The lucky beneficiary The Pushpa Rajapaksa Foundation situated at 78, Rosmead Place, Colombo 7. The chairperson of this foundation was Pushpa Rajapaksa, wife of then Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa. This charity organization had received Rs.19.41 million from CICT, the company that was offered the contract to Build, Operate and Transfer (BOT) the Colombo South Port Terminal. However, this issue has raised questions like why CICT generously donated such a large amount of money to a charity during their pre-operational stage. Questions are also asked as to on what basis this Foundation was chosen when there are many charity organizations in Sri Lanka that are in dire need of funds to carry out their work. 
The donation had been remitted to Pushpa Rajapaksa Foundation by CICT through The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (cheque No. 594691) to the Foundations account (No. 204-1-001-5-0003290) maintained at Peoples Bank (Headquarters) on May 21, 2012. 
CICT is a Chinese company affiliated to China Merchant Holding International. This company was specially incorporated to BOT the Colombo South Port Terminal Project and owns 85% shares while Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) owns the remaining shares. The Board of Directors at the time this donation was made were Jianhua Hu (Chairman), Yuklau Lam, Yunshu Lid (Executive Director), Rizhong Zhang, Weidong Deng, Yubin Li, Zhenwu She, Sun Ligan (Alternate Director), then Chairman SLPA, Priyath Bandu Wickrema and Managing Director SLPA Nihal Keppettipola. 
Questions are raised as to why CICT, after making a donation to this Foundation, documented the said amount of Rs.19.41 million as part of the Colombo South Port Development construction cost According to Clause 62.3 of the agreement, CICT and SLPA had entered into, it had been agreed to pay the CICT a certain percentage of the value of the construction cost of the terminal infrastructure after the completion of the contract period of 35 years. 
Clause 62.3 says, If this Agreement is terminated on expiry of the Term of this Agreement, the Ports Authority shall pay the Terminatiown Compensation to the Operator as follows- (a) take over the Terminal Infrastructure without any compensation to the Operator and, (b) pay the Operator the net book value of the Movable Assets and facilities existing at the Terminal on the Termination Date as Termination Compensation. 
As the money for this donation too had been documented as construction costs, the taxpayers have to bear a certain percentage of this amount (Rs.19.41 million). 
SLPA confirmed with this newspaper that they will have to pay CICT the net book value of the movable assets and facilities existing at the terminal, when the term of agreement expires. 
As per the documents, this newspaper is in possession of, they reveal that the management of CICT had accepted that they had capitalized on this expense included as construction costs. When, one of their officers, Ms. Catriona Jayasundera, was contacted to obtain a comment on the much speculated donation, this newspaper was requested to send the questions via e-mail to which they would respond to at the earliest. Hence, six questions were forwarded to Ms. Jayasundera on Friday July 13, but instead the e-mail received on July 16 (Monday) afternoon did not carry answers to any of the questions. Instead the CICT spokesperson wanted to refer to a press release claiming that what they have to is included in this document. The questions that were forwarded to CICT are:



1. Was the donation given to PRF the first CSR project carried out by CICT If the answer is no, can we know to whom such contributions have been made, how much and when
		PUSHPA RAJAPAKSA
		

2. What was the criterion CICT followed to choose PRF Did the request come from PRF or following a recommendation made by some party

3. As you have stated that the Rs.19.41 million was a donation, what made CICT to document this amount under construction work

4. Has the CICT made this donation with the Boards approval If so was it the Board that decided to capitalize this expense in the construction cost

5. Did Sri Lanka Ports Authority agree to document this money donated as construction cost

6. If not, did they at any time make any request to CICT to document the said amount as a recurrent expenditure If yes, did CICT abide by the instructions and if so when

In reply to the above questions, this newspaper received an e-mail which has been produced below. 


Dear Ms Kannangara, 
Thank you for your mail below. I appreciate the time you have taken to send out this mail to me. 
Please be guided that everything CICT has to say on this matter has been communicated via the press release which I have attached for your kind reference. 
Have a nice evening 
Thanks & Best Regards 
Catriona 

		BASIL RAJAPAKSA
		When the Auditor Generals Department was contacted to obtain a clarification as to whether a donation can be accounted as construction cost, a Deputy Auditor General, who wished to remain anonymous, told this newspaper that a donation cannot be documented as an expense in the construction cost and must be documented as recurrent expenditure. As they have capitalized the money they have paid to a charity as an expense in the construction cost, this cannot be called a donation and amounts to a commission. Money paid as a commission to get a contract or to get any approvals to start a project is accounted as construction expenses. But nowhere in the world is a donation that was made considered as a construction cost, the source said. 
Though members of the Rajapaksa family and senior members in the Joint Opposition (JO) refuted the New York Times claim, the focus is now on the former first family and the JO as to what they have now got to say about the payments they have received during their regime. 
Although the Colombo 7 address was the official address given regarding the Foundation at the time it was formed on November 24, 2010, later this charity had been operated from Basil Rajapaksas office at Orutota Road, Gampaha. While Pushpa Rajapaksa headed the Foundation, it also had Pushpa Amaratunge as its Vice Chairman, Mahendra Prabath Ramasinghe as the Treasurer and Nandasiri Yapa and Manabharana Madigasekera as Trustees. 


Fall of the Rajapaksa regime
Meanwhile, with the appointment of the new Board of Directors after the fall of the Rajapaksa regime in January, 2015, Finance Manager SLPA, by a letter dated March 27, 2015 to Chief Executive Officer, CICT had requested to clarify on the payment made to Pushpa Rajapaksa Foundation (PRF). 
The letter further states, We have been informed by the Crimes Bureau that a sum of Rs.19.41 million has been given to PRF on May 21, 2012 by CICT. The explanation is urgently required for the following in order to clarify the above payment. 
(a) Whether the above amount was granted by CICT utilizing its own funds 
(b) Whether the amount had been included in the construction cost as this had been granted during the period of construction. 
(c) Kindly inform the sources of fund. 
(d) Please forward audited financial statements for the year 2011/ 2012/ 2013/ 2014. 
Your urgent response is very much needed as SLPA is answerable to the Crimes Bureau. 
In response to the above, by letter dated March 30, 2015, Chief Financial Officer CICT has written to the Director Finance which states the following, We refer to your letter of March 27, 2015 reference FA/MA/CICT/2, and give below our explanation for the queries raised by the said letter. 
(a) Payments were made utilizing CICT funds. 
(b) Yes, CICT capitalized this expense in the construction cost. 
(c) The funds were from funds of CICT accumulated from Equity and Loan capital. 
(d) We have already handed over to SLPA the requested audited accounts up to 2014. However we now resubmit copies of same as requested. 
Following an audit query carried out by the Auditor Generals Department, regarding an alleged payment amounting to Rs.600 million and made to PRF by CICT, Chief Finance Manager SLPA by letter dated November 27, 2015 to the CEO, CICT has further requested to clarify whether the amount stated in the audit query is correct or if it differs with the correct amount to let them know how CICT had accounted the amount as per the audit query. 
Chief Financial Officer of CICT in his reply to Director Finance, SLPA by latter dated November 27, 2015 states, We write with reference to your letter FD/ FA/ C/ 82-XV/17/ 2015, dated November 27, 2015 and wish to clarify as follows. The amount indicated in the above letter is incorrect and the correct amount is LKR 19, 410,000 and this had been accounted for in the construction and in the progress account in 2012. (A copy of the above cheque and the payment voucher is attached herewith for your information) 


AG refuses to accept
Since the donation made to PRF had been documented as an expense in the construction which is detriment to the Government of Sri Lanka, Director Finance, SLPA Shirani Wanniarachchi once again, by letter dated December 7, 2015 (Ref: FD/FA/C/82-XV/17/2015) to CEO of CICT has stated that the Auditor General has not accepted how the donated money has been accounted for as construction cost and to adjust the payment as an expenditure in CICT financial statement. 

As per the documents, this newspaper is in possession of, they reveal that the management of CICT had accepted that they had capitalized on this expense included as construction costs

The letter further states, According to the view of the Auditor General, this accounting treatment is not acceptable and this has been mentioned in the audit query that we have sent to you on November 27, 2016. SLPA is also of the view that such expenses should not be treated as Construction cost and should only be treated as expenditure in the year it was incurred. Therefore we hereby inform you to adjust your financial statements accordingly. 
When replying CICT in its letter dated December 9, 2015 to the Finance Director, SLPA had said that once they finalize the accounts of the construction contract they will clear the construction in progress account by transferring specified assets accordingly. 
However, when an official e-mail was sent to SLPA Chairman on July 10, regarding this issue and to find out whether CICT had removed the donated money from their construction cost and had included it in their recurrent expenditure, Finance Director SLPA Shirani Wanniarachchi in her reply confirmed with the Dailymirror that CICT has confirmed that the amount paid had been debited as recurrent expenditure and deemed as a donation. 

When replying CICT in its letter dated December 9, 2015 to the Finance Director, SLPA had said that once they finalize the accounts of the construction contract they will clear the construction in progress account by transferring specified assets accordingly.

Following this e-mail, another e-mail was forwarded to the Chairman and the Finance Director of SLPA on July 11, to get the above statement confirmed and requesting them to tell this newspaper in which financial year (profit and loss account) CICT had reflected this donation as a recurring cost. In this e-mail it was also asked how many recurring months and from which month/year CICT had started the recurrent schedule. However there was no response from SLPA until the paper went for publication. 
Hence there is some doubt as to whether CICT has removed the donated money from the construction cost and had shown it in the recurrent expenditure or whether they have not made any changes to their initial plan to capitalize this expense in the construction cost. 
Although allegations have been levelled against the former regime for offering the contract to construct the Colombo South Port Project to CICT without following Government procurement guidelines, Finance Director SLPA in her reply, had stated that SLPA received only one bid- which was from CICT- when quotations were called for and that bidder was selected with the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers during the Rajapaksa Government, as per procurement guidelines. 

According to the sources, when CICT completes 35 years and hands the container operation service to the SLPA, the gantry cranes would need replacement

Meanwhile according to the B Report submitted to Fort Magistrate Court (Case No: B 586/15) by the Financial Crime Investigation Division (FCID), when questioned, former Chairman SLPA Priyath Bandu Wickrema and Managing Director SLPA, Nihal Keppettipola, have both stated that although they were in the CICT Director Board during the time, the donation had been made to Pushpa Rajapaksa Foundation in 2012, they were unaware of the payment nor had they discussed the matter at a Board Meeting. 


Investigators misled
Can Priyath Bandu and Keppettipola claim that they were unaware of this transaction and if so this matter had never been discussed at any of the Board Meetings They have misled the investigators. Action has to be taken against both these former officials, sources alleged. 
The sources further asked as to how the previous regime granted the contract to construct the South Port Terminal to CICT and to transfer the container handling process to SLPA only after 35 years when this project would be given to SLPA in order to generate more income to the country 
The most difficult task in the port expansion project was the construction of the breakwater. This contract was offered to a Korean company with an investment of Rs. 85,000 million being made from a loan obtained from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). After the construction of the breakwater, there was no necessity for the SLPA to give the contract to build the South Port Terminal and to install the gantry cranes to CICT, because it could have been done by us. Although Priyath Bandu Wickrema and a few of his loyalists in the SLPA Director Board, treasury representatives and the Attorney Generals representatives, who were involved in the dialogues to hand over the terminal construction and BOT to CICT, the treasury representatives should have intervened and showed them what losses the country would suffer if this project was given for a 35-year period, sources alleged. 

According to the sources, when CICT completes 35 years and hands the container operation service to the SLPA, the gantry cranes would need replacement. In such an event the SLPA will once again have to invest heavily to get new gantry cranes installed, sources claimed. 
According to the sources, most of the larger ships that enter the Colombo Port enter the CICT terminal because of its depth. 
The SLPA terminals cannot accommodate the larger vessels as its depth is much lesser than that of the CICT. Hence most of the larger vessels enter the CICT terminal and SLPA generates an income worth US$ 4 from each container as royalty. The income generated through this royalty is not even sufficient to pay the loan interest. Had this project been given to SLPA, by now we could have settled the loan and generated a huge income from the south terminal, sources said. 
The sources further accused a high ranking politician in the good governance administration for his attempt to offer the east terminal project to a foreign company instead of providing the necessary funds to construct the terminal and install the gantry cranes. 
Why cant this Government provide enough funds for the east terminal project and settle the loan with interest within few years and then generate massive revenue like how CICT is now generating, sources added. 



Donation to the charitable foundation was a CSR commitment-CICT

Colombo International Container Terminals Limited (CICT) has reiterated that its payment of Rs. 19,410,000/- (equivalent to US$150,000), to the Pushpa Rajapaksa Foundation was a donation, in good faith, for the construction of houses for the less privileged. 
In a statement prompted by media reports on this payment, the Company said: This donation was made long after the project concession agreement for the Colombo South Terminal had been signed and construction work on the terminal had already commenced. This payment is clearly reflected in our audited accounts for the relevant year. We therefore categorically reject the implication that the payment is tantamount to a bribe. 

This issue had already been highlighted in the media and was investigated by the relevant authorities three years ago

This issue had already been highlighted in the media and was investigated by the relevant authorities three years ago. However, in the wake of these latest reports, we reiterate and bring to the notice of the media and the general public that CICT made a donation to the said foundation, as part of its commitment to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and did not intend it to be, nor believe it to be otherwise.
CICT has already provided the required information on this matter to the relevant authorities. The company has no further information to provide on the matter. For the record, we wish to reiterate that this donation was a part of CICTs CSR commitment, and in keeping with this commitment, we have also supported other deserving projects such as providing support to the victims of the Koslanda landslide in 2016 with cash donations and rations; major sponsorship of the Wheelchair Tennis programme of Sri Lanka Tennis Association (SLTA); and a donation through the China Merchant Charity Foundation of foldable intraocular lenses and cartridges worth $ 60,000 along with an allocation of $ 200,000 for cataract surgeries for needy patients under the Tribute to love, China  Sri Lanka Free Cataract Surgery Campaign etc. 


CICT has already provided the required information on this matter to the relevant authorities. The company has no further information to provide on the matter

Once funding is allocated, CICT believes that the funding so allocated would be utilised for the said projects by the receiving agencies, without CICT having to play a supervisory role as to the implementation of such projects.

We have no problem with Former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa contesting the 2020 Presidential Election, State Minister Range Bandara said.
"Whoever opposes us we have to face the election positively. It is not a question of whether Gotabaya is a candidate. Everyone knows about his past and knows who sent white vans to abduct people and the killing of beggars," he said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

SF rejects media report over underworld connection
	
While rejecting media reports that some underworld figures were protected by a Senior Minister, Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka today said those reports were targeted to defame and cause inconvenience to him.
Minister Fonseka told a news conference that some media reports had stated that five underworld leaders, whom the Police were looking to arrest, were protecting a minister and had become the private bodyguards of the Minister.
He said even though one such report had directly alleged him of this incident and published his picture; the other report had only mentioned it as an incident involved with a Senior Minister by not mentioning his name.
I do not need protection from the underworld or do not intend to protect them. I have ten Police officers, four Inspectors and Four Special Task Force (STF) officers as my guards. I have two Police vehicles too. Anybody can inquire with these facts, he said.
The journalist who has reported this news has some personal agenda and has criticised me at several instances. The Ministry will take legal action on that report claiming Rs. 500 million for the damages caused. There are some political forces behind these reports too, he added.
He also rejected the claims that there were some underworld members working at his office.
While referring to the allegation that a former Police officer named Aruna Attanayake alias Police was included in his security team, he said under democracy any person was entitled to do politics and nobody could question it.
He said the person who was appearing in a picture published with the said media report, had a case filed against him in Courts before twenty years ago and now he had a settled background and added that he could not question on the number of Court cases a supporter had before entering into politics.
Even there are Court cases against me. We cannot deny a persons entitlement to engage in politics and to support a certain politician in any manner. I have got to know of a person named Kristo from this very media report, he said.
The media reports have also included the name of a boy called Nayanajith, a university student and an old boy of a renowned school in Colombo, who is innocent and having a decent family background. Police authorities have also guaranteed his innocence, he added.
He said he had made no influence to Police over the release of a brother of a Pradeshiya Sabha member, Gihan Sandaruwan and added that only his mother had called him up to inform the injustice they had faced.
With reference to a person named Manju, he reiterated the fact that they could not inquire people of their legal history before they had started doing politics.
He also said a person who worked for him was killed by the STF and added that even it was not an underworld incident but a clash between two parties.
These people are not with me. They are working for us in politics through electorate basis as United National Party (UNP) supporters. Every person is free to do so. I have informed the authorities concerned over this issue including the Law and Order Minister to take necessary actions with this regard, he said.
Meanwhile, he said though there are good Police officers, the Police had become a corrupt institute, which had now been politicised and added that the situation had worsened after the establishment of the Police Commission, though people were expecting better condition.
Journalist: What do you think of these personal attacks on your image and the reason behind it
Minister: These attacks are carried out due to political agendas. I earlier said that one of these journalists was writing columns praising Rajapaksas.
Lankadeepa Journalist: Are you saying it responsibly Because this journalist was only doing media reports on army and crimes. We have not seen such a column. Are you saying it responsibly that he was working for Rajapaksas
Minister: Why Is not he writing a political column
Lankadeepa Journalist: No, we have not seen. Are you saying it responsibly
Minister: I have inquired I think
Lankadeepa Journalist: You should have corrected it. As far as we know, he has no such political involvement.
Minister: I will inquire about it.
Lankadeepa Journalist: I represent the specific newspaper. Therefore, I am asking you to inquire on it and then to make a statement responsibly, because as far as we know, he does not write anything on politics.
Minister: Okay, I will inquire and let you know.

SL risks losing GSP+ if death penalty implemented
	
EU ambassadors warned Sri Lanka on Monday against ending its 42-year moratorium on capital punishment and said the island risked losing trade concessions if it went ahead, the Daily Mail reported on Monday quoting the AFP.
"The diplomatic missions have requested the President to maintain the moratorium on the implementation of the death penalty and to uphold Sri Lanka's tradition of opposition to capital punishment," the EU ambassadors said in a joint statement.
Diplomats said they expected Sirisena to roll back the decision, but should the island go ahead it would loose preferential access for its exports to the 28-member EU bloc.
"If Sri Lanka resumes capital punishment, Colombo will immediately lose the GSP-Plus status," an EU diplomatic source has told AFP.
This refers to its GSP Plus restored by the EU in May 2017 after a seven-year hiatus.
Sri Lanka was denied GSP Plus status in 2010 after failing to meet its rights obligations. The Sirisena administration reapplied after coming to power in 2015.
EU diplomats have estimated that Sri Lanka gains an estimated USD 350 million advantage annually thanks to the GSP-Plus system.

## Title: Ten-year-old girl suffering from a rare and incurable disease
## Section: Opinion
## Date: 18 July 2018 12:00 am
Ten-year-old girl suffering from a rare and incurable disease
	
They have to spend large sums of money for medical expenses continuously.
A pathetic story is reported from the distant village of Paragaswewa in Dehiattakandiya where a ten-year-old girl lives, by consuming only beef as her staple diet for five and a half years, due to a rare disease.
Her belly began to swell, while she was being fed. Unlike other children, her bowel movements were confined to discharging only water
	The child becomes allergic when any food other than beef is given
This little girl P.D. Sithumi Araliya Muthupabalu, is the youngest daughter of P.D. Jayantharatne and V.G. Wijelatha Weerasinghe who live in this village. 
The girls mother, V.G.Wijelatha Weerasinghe expressed her views about her daughters disease to our sister paper Lankadeepa as follows:
This child was born on May 30, 2008 as a healthy baby weighing three and a half kilos at birth. She was breast-fed by me. Her belly began to swell, while she was being fed. Unlike other children, her bowel movements were confined to discharging only water. When this situation continued for about a month, I brought her to the Polonnaruwa General Hospital where she was admitted for medical treatment. She was then transferred to the Lady Ridgeway Hospital in Colombo as her disease could not be cured.
She said that her daughter was given all types of food, but the efforts were futile. They had also given green apples and Anamalu plantains in addition to Jeevani. She had been under medical treatment in that hospital for about 4  years and subsequently brought home. The child had then been unable to walk, her belly was swollen and she could not stand up. According to the girls mother, although various types of food had been given, she could not digest anything.
This is a very rare disease condition known as Glucose-Galactose mal-absorption where the patient is unable to absorb any food containing galactose. There are less than 200 such patients identified in the world today
She said further, I gave her a piece of beef, although we as Buddhists, do not consume beef or bring beef to our home. However, nothing happened to her like when she consumed other foods. So we continued giving her beef, after which she began to stand up. Now, she is ten years old. We gave her beef for all three meals since she was four years and a half years old. When we did not have money to buy beef, chicken was given, but it did not digest like the beef.
According to her mother, the child becomes allergic when any food other than beef is given. Her child attends school now, does school work well and does not seem to be ill. However, her mother has a habit of bringing her home whenever she falls ill during school hours. She did not say that they suffered because of their childs illness, but they had mortgaged their only paddy field at Rs.600,000 for their daughters medical treatment. As a means of livelihood, she had gone to towns like Kandy, Badulla and Polonnaruwa with her mother and begged money from people. When they said that their daughter could only eat beef, people had said that they were not willing to contribute money for such sinful deeds.
According to the mother, their child is doing well now, but is suffering from diabetes and bladder stones. The medical expenses for all these diseases are borne to some extent by their two elder sons who are employed and in addition, the milk from their cows is sold to meet the expenses. She said that their child is consuming one and a half kilos of beef daily, which is bought from Kaduruwela at a cost of Rs.1,200. As such they are compelled to spend a large amount of money even without a permanent income. They have to spend large sums of money for medical expenses continuously. She bestowed merits on those who contributed money for the survival of their child and she requested for financial assistance from any volunteers. 
Doctor Peduru Arachchi who is attached to the Childrens ward of Dehiattakandiya Base Hospital said, This is a very rare disease condition known as Glucose-
Galactose mal-absorption where the patient is unable to absorb any food containing galactose. There are less than 200 such patients identified in the world today. The food we eat daily including starch (carbohydrates), fruit and vegetables are digested and absorbed due to glucose. As the end result of the digestion of all milk foods, galactose is absorbed to the body. The reason for this disease can be given as the inability of an enzyme to absorb these two compositions within the intestines (small). This is a genetic disease condition and there is no definite medical treatment except taking foods which do not contain the above two nutrients.
Beef which has a unique nutritional composition can be used as a food in which there emerge no symptoms of any disease. He explained about the medical treatment in a nutshell, that it was only beef that can be given as food for the survival of the child concerned
According to him, beef which has a unique nutritional composition can be used as a food in which there emerge no symptoms of any disease. He explained about the medical treatment in a nutshell, that it was only beef that can be given as food for the survival of the child concerned.
The parents of the child suffer endlessly to save the life of this child. Doctors say that the child is in a dangerous situation at present. It has become a problem for the parents to save her life, due to insufficient finances.
The parents kindly request any benefactors who are willing to make their contribution in a bid to save their child.

Some Green party backbenchers are reportedly furious over a video footage on a telephone dialogue that has gone viral and are out for the blood of the actor, who, they claim, has done as much damage to the party as the Kala Madam who made a fervent wish for the return of an LTTE rule for the North.

After a lengthy discussion a group of backbenchers had reportedly decided that the actor-turned -politico should get for his latest shenanigan the same punishment as that was meted out to the Kala madam.
They will meet the party leader shortly to tell him to warn the actor not to use the party credentials to stage tragi-comedies in future and if he were allowed to do more damage to the party resorting to his bioscope antics, people would decide at the coming polls to send all party members home.

Tug-O-War between two govt. entities threatens supply of power in South
	
As a result of a Tug-O-War taking place between the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) over the purchase of power from a private power supplier, Ace Power that is based in Embilipitiya, a crisis situation has arisen with regard to the supply of power to the Southern Province.
The CEB had entered into an agreement with Ace Power on April 5 to obtain power for the next three years. However, the PUCSL had called the award of the tender illegal and had refused to give its approval for the CEB to purchase power from this supplier. Accordingly obtaining power from this station had been stopped effective from July 16.
The Chairman of CEB W. B. Ganegala said that Cabinet approval had already been obtained to purchase power from the Ace Power and that with the signing of this agreement the Board has been able to ensure an uninterrupted supply of power for the next three years. (Ranjan Kasthuri)

Why he opposed the party choice!
	

This Diyawanna member elected from a district not far from Colombo is a heavyweight of the JO and he is also a distant kinsman of the former strongman. He hails from a prominent political cum business family.

A rumour went viral recently that this politico vehemently opposed a majority-backed proposal of the JO to run a popular sibling of the R-family as the party candidate at the upcoming big poll. The rumour also said that this politico was keener on scuttling this proposal than the maverick from the old left who has now found refuge in the JO.
Some party stalwarts, puzzled over the politicos aversion to nominating the R-family sibling as the party candidate had made discreet inquiries to find the reason for his seemingly inexplicable stance. They now claim that they have stumbled on the reason that seemed unfathomable: the politico had decided that none, but he himself should be the party candidate at the next big poll and he had entertained this ambition following a prediction made to him by a dignitary of a certain religious denomination: that he could occupy the countrys highest political office for sure if he made a bid for it!

Will Capital punishment go down the drain
	
The governments decision to implement Death Penalty on drug related offenders has opened a can of worms, with human rights campaigners here and abroad demanding the withdrawal of the decision. The European Union (EU) had on Monday officially communicated its opposition to the move. The main reason for the opposition is the inability of reversing the punishment if it is found later that it had been implemented on a wrong person.
The decision had been prompted by a number of seizures of drugs by various law enforcement arms in the country within a short period of time recently. A main feature of these incidents had been the revelation that the trafficking of drugs had been masterminded by those who were behind bars after being convicted for the same offence. The decision, in a way represents an irony as it was taken after the law enforcement authorities successfully busted several attempts by the traffickers to smuggle drugs into the country. Had they gone to the market undetected, the government wouldnt have taken such a decision.
The drug trafficking into the country and through the country has shown such an upward trend during the past two decades that Sri Lanka had been called a drug trafficking hub by some foreign media. In fact in the recent past large hauls of drugs, mainly heroin and cocaine had been detected. It must be recalled that the largest drug haul in South Asia was detected in Sri Lanka in August 2013 where customs agents had seized 250 kg of heroin worth $19 million at a container terminal in Colombo. A 200 kg heroin haul -- worth more than two billion rupees on the street - was found inside a car in May last year in a Colombo suburb. Anti-narcotics authorities seized their biggest ever haul of cocaine -- 90 kg worth about two billion rupees -- being smuggled into the island in June 2016.
There have been reports of a number of crimes as well along with the incidents of detection of drugs during the last few months. Responding to the allegation by the Opposition following these incidents that the discipline and the law enforcement in the country had declined drastically President Maithripala Sirisena had stated that in spite of the media and the Opposition making a furore over a spurt of crimes in the country there is indeed a downward trend in crimes this year compared to the last few years. It may be true. When incidents occur at a stretch rather than spreading throughout the year they would draw the attention of the media and thereby the people. Yet, the cruelty and the scant regard shown to human life by the criminals undeniably demand action. 
It is clear that there is a nexus between drugs, crimes and the proliferation of small arms. DIG Priyantha Jayakody, who has been engaged in combating organized criminal gangs for more than two decades, has pointed out last year during an interview with the Sunday Times that many of the present violent crimes were due to criminal gangs clashing with each other over the illegal drugs trade. The problem also points its association with the ethnic war that ended nearly a decade ago as the conflict had provided the much needed arms and ammunition to the drug trade and the criminal gangs involved in it.
Brig. Ranjan de Silva, the former National Coordinator of the now -- defunct National Commission Against the Proliferation of Illicit Small Arms (NCAPISA) once in a newspaper interview had this to say: The three insurgencies, especially the one sparked by the ethnic conflict, only gave an impetus to the proliferation. The ethnic conflict made violence go hi-tech with the induction of modern weapons. T-56, the standard weapon of the armed services and the Police, has become the weapon of choice of criminals too. The armed conflict in the North and East became a fertile source of supply of small arms to the underworld. The countrys criminal behaviour graduated on to a higher plane. 
One cannot deny the association of the politicians with these three menaces-drugs, weapons and crimes. So long as the concerned authorities do not have the will to sever this association, even capital punishment would go down the drain.

Yearning for good old days!
	

This former Diyawanna politico with diverse business interests took advantage of his closeness to the throne and a monitoring job thrust on him to run the countrys foreign affairs as he wanted.

And that and his other doings not only brought the Government then in power into much disrepute, but also, he had to reap the harvest of what he had sown at least in part when he had to languish in the State-run lodge for a while under the new dispensation.
The man went into oblivion later and after some time emerged from his hideaway to make a comeback to the public life in a big way through the glory of the former strongman. However, the former strongman despite his soft corner for the man had to disown him due to a howl of protests from close associates against accommodating the prodigal one back inthe fold.
The man becoming sick of being too long in the cold storage, reportedly called on his onetime mentor once again seeking nomination to contest the upcoming general polls on the Pohottuwa ticket.
The former strongman, however, finding that his onetime buddys visit had created ripples of discontent among his loyalists had given him the red signal again,they say.
