Delimitation report: PC polls soon after PM's committee report
	
The five-member committee chaired by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has been directed to submit its observations and recommendations to Presidenit Maithripala Sirisena in two months ,Provincial, Local Government Sports Minister Faizer Musthapha said.
He said the report will be gazetted soon after paving way for the Elections Commission to conduct PC polls next year.
"If the UNP wants to conduct the elections under the much criticized preferential voting system it will have to go Parliament and introduce amendments to the Provincial Councils (Amendment) Act of 2017 and have it approved thus causing a further delay," the minister said.
He told the media that he did not see any reason for the delay in conducting the PC polls early next year because the report was due in two months.
The minister said the delimitation report was rejected because no one wanted to hold the PC polls under the guidelines recommended by the delimitation report.
?What is important is that the political parties rejected the delimitation report and not the new electoral system," he said.
The minister told a journalist that minority parties opposed the delimitation report fearing their parties would elect a lesser number of members.
He expressed disappointment over the failure of party leaders failing to debate the report next month.
?It was a failure on the part of all members. My responsibility was to table the report in Parliament and I did it soon after I got the report. The SLFP did not vote for the delimitation report despite its stance that the PC polls must be held under the new system,? the minister said.(Sandun A Jayasekera)

MK Stalin, son of former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu late Muthuvel Karunanidhi has been elected as DMK president, a post which has been lying vacant since the demise of M Karunanidhi, at the party?s General Council meeting today.
All along considered the political heir apparent of his father, Stalin was elected unopposed as he was the sole candidate in the fray at the close of nomination Monday evening.
Chants hailing Stalin as "Thalapathy" (Commander) rented the Kalaignar Arangam where the meeting was underway even as the General Council members cheered with loud applause.
Stalin, who has been handling the party since the run-up to the Tamil Nadu Assembly Elections in 2016, was appointed ?working president? of the party in 2017.
The 65-year-old leader had filed his nomination papers at Anna Arivalayam, the party headquarters, in Chennai on Sunday.
Following his elevation, Stalin paid tributes to DMK founder CN Annadurai and former Tamil Nadu chief minister Karunanidhi. (Deccan Chronicle)

Mixed and messed electoral system
	
?
One cannot understand why the government, knowing well that the majority members of the Parliament would not vote for the report on delimitation of provincial council wards, presented it in the House for approval. And it is even hilarious that the Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha who presented the report to Parliament for approval, had himself voted against it.??
Now that the report has been rejected by the Parliament, a committee which is to be appointed by the Speaker under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister will review it and report? to the President within two months. And if the President accepted that report, then the delimitation process would be deemed to be approved by the Parliament and implemented. Therefore, according to the procedure, once the Members of the Parliament reject the report in the House they would not have any say in re-evaluating it, before it is implemented.? ?
Had the report been accepted by the Parliament, elections for three provincial councils that stand dissolved would have to be held forthwith. With the minister presenting a report for which even he did not vote, the allegation by the Opposition that the government was hell bent on postponing the elections, is being vindicated.? ?There are a lot of complaints by various political parties on the demarcation of ward boundaries by the Delimitation Commission headed by former Surveyor General Kanakaratnam Thavalingam. Reasons for these complaints may be real or perceived, as the interests of political parties vary. Mr. Thavalingam, meanwhile stands by the report saying it is ?hundred percent correct.???
In fact, the real issue lies not in the delimitation of wards, but in the new electoral system as a whole which necessitated the delimitation process. The country has already experimented the new system in last February with regard to the local government elections and it created a mess in local bodies. It was such a muddle that even former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who was the de-facto leader of the winning party, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna had stated that the new system was so chaotic and has to be changed. This sentiment had been echoed by President Maithripala Sirisena as well, later.??
The new system doubled the number of members in local councils causing a heavy burden on the public coffers. Besides, wining parties in many local bodies could not institute the councils for weeks and in some councils for months by electing their chairmen and deputy chairmen, as the Opposition in those councils had been larger than the ruling parties. It was a result of doing away with the bonus seat system and the cut-off point for the political parties for their eligibility. And the provision for the female representation had also created confusion, compelling some political parties in some local bodies to appoint women for all the slots they had been entitled to in the?respective councils.? ?
No doubt, the women representation in peoples? representative bodies such as the LG councils, provincial councils and the Parliament is a progressive concept. But the method that has been put in practice is not workable due to the conflict between the loftiness of the idea and the psyche of the constituency.? No individual or political party is to blame for the messy mixed electoral system that has been accepted now to be implemented at the provincial and local government level, as the concept was mooted during a ten-year long Parliamentary Select Committee process and adopted by the Parliament with majority votes. Yet, the leaders of the main political parties are not satisfied with what is in hand after it was put to test for the first time in February. Nevertheless, they are attempting to continue with it now at the provincial level as well.? ?
In short, democracy was distorted in local level with the votes received by parties not corresponding to the councils they won, while winning parties in some cases being deprived of the right to rule the councils, due to the kind of mixed electoral system we have. Then, what is the purpose of trying it out again at provincial level? Either we have to refine the mixed system or go back to the old Proportional Representation (PR) system.??

Prez urged to obtain full interpretation of Article 9 from SC
	
The Buddha Sasana Karya Sadhaka Mandalaya comprising some 15 prominent Buddhist organizations in a letter to the President has requested him to obtain a comprehensive interpretation of Article 9 of the Constitution and take necessary steps to implement it.
The letter signed by the joint secretaries of the Mandalaya, Most Ven. Tirukunamale Ananda Maha Nayaka Thera and Ven. Professor Agalakada Sirisumana Thera states that this is necessary because of the insults levelled at the Buddha; the distortion of the Dhamma and the belittling of the Buddhist cultural traditions that are taking place under the cover of the freedom of expression and democracy.
The Karya Sadhaka Mandalaya whose patrons are the Mahanayaka Theras of all three Nikayas includes prominent Buddhist organizations such as the All Ceylon Buddhist Congress, Dharma Vijaya Foundation, Colombo YMBA, All Ceylon Women?s Buddhist Congress, Maha Bodhi Society, Shanthi Foundation and the Buddhist Lawyers? Association.
The letter states: ?We consider it a constitutional obligation of the government to prevent the continuous insults on the Buddha, the distortion of the Dhamma and the belittling of the Buddhist cultural traditions by taking cover behind Democracy and Freedom of Expression prevailing in the country.
"We would like to appreciate the recent steps taken by Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe and the Government to ban the distasteful book titled ?Budunge Rastiyaduwa? written with commercial intent by insulting the Buddha and belittling the great renunciation and enlightenment and also to ban the radio drama series produced by the government?s reconciliation office.
"No intellectual or wise person who appreciates civility and social values would approve of the statement made by a government minister that the ban was a false act that should not have been done, and the statements made by a highly opinionated group among the artistes who prefer certain political ideologies above Buddhist cultural values, finding fault with the government over the ban. The arguments put forward by them are meaningless and empty.
"These processes along with the spreading of intoxicants and drugs in the country are done with the intention of corrupting and destroying the much appreciated Sri Lankan value systems and thinking patterns. It shows that these are done to fulfil foreign wishes.
"Therefore, Your Excellency, the Buddha Sasana Karya Sadhaka Mandalaya is informing you to obtain a comprehensive interpretation of Article 9 of the Constitution from the Supreme Court as requested quite some time ago by the late Ven. Madihe Pannasiha Maha Nayaka Thera and the people, and implement it as a solution to such problems created to obstruct religious and social harmony and reconciliation in the country.

Ratanjankar Episode: What really happened ? Ratanjankar was the Principal at Marris College of Music
	
?
Sunil Shantha was one of Tissa Abeysekara?s icons. In his opinion, an unsung hero. Even a brief perusal of his biography confirms this, from his forays into Indian music and his later repudiation of the raghadari tradition, acts which cost him support at the top and reduced him to a pauper. Over the years, all that has been written on, delved into, examined, done justice to, and in more ways than one, settled.??
But Abeysekara?s adulation of Shantha did not end there. In article after article, he explored what he considered to be the most shameless act committed to Sinhala music, at least in the 20th century: the cleansing of a promising horde of vocalists and instrumentalists who sought to go beyond the ragadhari sampradaya. One name, more than any other, crops up here. Ratanjankar. S. N. Ratanjankar.?
?
The Sinhala people did not possess a musical tradition of their own. This was especially so after the 12th century, when Sinhalese poetry entered its Classical Period, which as Martin Wickramasinghe pointed out spelt out an era of decadence rather than of renaissance. The only real musical tradition we could claim, given this point, was the ?jana kaviya?. Madawala Ratnayake, in his ?Gee Sindu Sahithya?, contends that ?uncultured? as he would have been, the rural peasant in Sinhalese society was able to musicalise these ?kavi? as he went about his daily work. This was the ?common man?s poetry?, more rooted than what was being written at the king?s court. Despite their divergent points of view, then, both Cumaratunga Munidasa and Martin Wickramasinghe went on to criticise the Sasadavata and the Muvadevdavata on the grounds that they were decadent and uprooted (Wickramasinghe in ?Sinhala Sahitya Nageema? reserved his harshest criticism for the Muvadevdavata).??
Probably the biggest issue to resolve after Radio Ceylon was founded (in 1925) was how to ?musicalise? the folk tradition. It was over this issue that the Ratanjankar episode raged. Initially, both sides of the divide - the administrators at Radio Ceylon and the traditionalists - believed in going back to the past to replenish modern music. But then the controversy raged, and as it raged, one of the biggest ironies that made itself evident was the fact that these two camps were led respectively by a teacher and his student. For Ratanjankar had been Principal at the Marris Collegeof Music at Lucknow when Sunil Shantha had studied there. The guru had groomed the chela; now the chela was rebelling against him.??
?
The trajectory of the Sinhala music in the 20th century confirms this: Sunil Shantha gave way to Amaradeva, Victor Ratnayake, and Sanath Nandasiri, all of whom, without reservation, have spoken warmly of Ratanjankar and Edirisinghe
Abeysekara does not mention this fact in any of his assessments of the Ratanjankar episode. Nor does he point out that this conflict, rooted as it was in a rift between two different cultures, was not a conflict as far as the objective each side harboured, i.e. that contemporary Sinhala music needed to be salvaged from our folk tradition, was concerned. They did not disagree over the objective, rather over the way in which it was to be achieved. And so, just as Munidasa himself had rebelled against the employment of a German, Wilhelm Geiger, to compile ?A Grammar of the Sinhala Language?, so Shantha rebelled against employing an Indian to decide on what music should and should not be broadcast. The parallels between these two conflicts can be gleaned from Shantha?s own words: ?I do not believe that we should wish for a foreigner to come to Sri Lanka to advise us on how to create a national music just because we brought a German to advise us on the Sinhala language.???
Abeysekara is correct in his portrait of Shantha as a lone crusader against the ?pothe guras? (his term, not mine) at Radio Ceylon. But as Victor Ratnayake told me, and as Rohana Baddage explained later, what he missed out was the fact that there was no ?schism? as such between these two camps. I am not inclined to agree with Baddage?s assertion that it amounted to a clash of personalities and nothing more, but I subscribe to his view that to indict those who were on the ?side of the willing?, which included Lionel Edirisinghe, was patently unfair. To do that, as Victor aptly put it, would be to discount the contributions that the likes of Edirisinghe made to our music. The reality would therefore have been more complex, more multifarious, than the pothe-guras-versus-lone-crusader conflict it was reduced to.? ?To be sure, it is true that Ratanjankar would not have possessed the requisite knowledge of the people and their customs, customs which Shantha returned to in song after song. But it is equally true that the efforts of the Hela Havula in forging a hela-fied mother tongue, though in concert with nationalist sentiments, were doomed to be the preserve of a few gifted writers, well beyond the reach of the multitude. The trajectory of the Sinhala music in the 20th century confirms this: Sunil Shantha gave way to Amaradeva, Victor Ratnayake, and Sanath Nandasiri, all of whom, without reservation, have spoken warmly of Ratanjankar and Edirisinghe.??
Besides, if Shantha was emphatic in his opposition to Ratanjankar, not many of the lyricists and writers at Radio Ceylon (can be seen to have) shared his views. When Ratanjankar visited Sri Lanka for the second time in 1952, for instance, he delivered a lecture in English at the Royal Asiatic Society on ?The Place of Folk Songs in the Development of Music?, where he argued that the ?proper local music? of Sri Lanka lay in its villages (Field, page 102). The speech was pivotal in that it spurred a lyricist to try through Radio Ceylon to transform folk poetry into contemporary song.? ?
That lyricist was Madawala Ratnayake, whose contributions to Sinhala music cannot be discounted regardless of language politics. Musical nationalism in Sri Lanka of the 20th century has no real starting point, and it differs from one person?s perspective to another. I can, however, point at a year: 1957, when Ratnayake commenced a program with Amaradeva, ?Jana Gayana?. That programme had been commenced and stopped five years before: 1952, when Ratanjankar arrived here, and when Sunil Santha was expelled from Radio Ceylon.??
Where Abeysekara was correct in his assessment is his point that it quickly led to the annihilation of musicians seen as pandering to a ?lesser tradition?. ?Annihilate? is of course a strong word, and it is hardly used in administrative parlance, but appears in a report dated May 1956 attributed to the then Controller of Music at Radio Ceylon, Dunstan de Silva: ?I started a campaign against artistes singing westernized music and completely annihilated it? (Abeysekara?s translation). The campaign had (been) turned into an inquisition, when an inquisition had not been its aim.? ?And yet, even here, I have my reservations: it is difficult to ascertain why this process of annihilation was allowed to run its course, or whether it was needed at that point of time given the virtual absenting of folk music from the local music scene (which was composed for the most, with the notable exception of Ananda Samarakoon, of gramophone records and the hybridized theatrical exercises of John de Silva).? ?In any case, there was a bigger conundrum: just what was ?westernised music?? From C. T. Fernando to P. L. A. Somapala, from the early baila masters to the later pioneers of popular music, ?westernized? was a term invoked to disparage music that existed outside what was officially sanctioned. ?His name is associated in my mind forever with the sad story of contemporary popular music in this country,? Abeysekara wrote of Lionel Edirisinghe, and while he may have telescoped the issue, I do concur that Edirisinghe?s efforts may (inadvertently) have bifurcated our music industry into two strands which were to meet only intermittently thereafter: the jana and the janapriya.? ?
?
When Ratanjankar visited Sri Lanka for the second time in 1952, for instance, he delivered a lecture in English at the Royal Asiatic Society on ?The Place of Folk Songs in the Development of Music?, where he argued that the ?proper local music? of Sri Lanka lay in its villages
To be sure, they did meet, significantly, somewhere in the eighties, when Amaradeva, the exponent of the sarala geeya, sang for Clarence Wijewardena, the exponent of popular music. The song was ?Sasara Gewa Yana?, and it still symbolises, for me, a fusion of sorts. But then that?s another story.??
In April 1991, Abeysekara gave a speech at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute. He talked of Shantha and how his songs found their way to the most unlikely of places: weddings, parties, Big Matches. I think the reason why those songs evolved into ditties to be performed at such events was their quaint, poignant base. They were the ruminations of a soul that which had rediscovered its roots, which was going back to the village, constantly, in search of fresh material. In Shantha we find an entire musical tradition that sought to vocalize both the melody and language.? ?That it gave way to a tradition which brought together our folk poetry and classical Indian music is another issue. What is important is that musical traditions are never cast in stone. Sure, we can condemn those who did away with what might have been. But history is made up of art forms ?which might have been? giving way to what they eventually become. 66 years after S. N.Ratanjankar arrived here, Sunil Shantha was expelled from Radio Ceylon, and Madawala Ratnayake began ?Jana Gayana?, are we then any worse off, as a nation of music lovers?? ?
In many ways, yes, but that begs the question: could it have been otherwise? The arts are never predicated on firmly set traditions. They evolve on their own. Given that, it is impossible to infer what might have been. And it is even more impossible to reduce those conflicts which make up their evolution to one reason, much less one person.? ? ??

Remembering  a Great Educationist Founder principal and Philanthropist
	
Remembering?Samaranayake on his 49th?Death Anniversary
His 49th death anniversary fell on August 26, 2018. His 112th Birth anniversary falls on November 26, 2018
The passing away of Mr William Henry Samaranayake, retired Principal of St. Bernadette?s College, Polgahawela in the year 1969, had removed from the public life of this country a great educationist and silent social worker, whose activities were directed to the welfare of the students many of whom rose to power and distinction.
When Mr Samaranayake took over St. Bernadette?s College, it had only a few cadjan huts to house the students.Mr Samaranayake?s courage and perseverance helped to build up the magnificent buildings for the college.
He was not only of an unassuming disposition, but also had dignity without pride.
He was calm and collected in the manner and was a gentleman par excellence.
Mr Samaranayake belonged to an age which is fast sliding into history but he successfully accomplished his tasks reaching eminence in diverse fields.
His philanthropic genius enabled many unfortunate children to bask in the sunshine of his great-hearted acts of generosity.?
Mr Samaranayake will long be remembered as a great educationist, who disciplined and moulded the characters of students, to be respectful towards parents, elders and the State.?
Those students who occupy positions of dignity in the country today owe a great deal to Mr Samaranayake.
He was also a prolific writer to the press and his articles were directed towards creating public opinion.
Three great positions worthy of human ambition are to be the ruler of a great city, the Principal of a great school and the author of a great book.
Mr Samaranayake was not only the Principal of that great school, St. Bernadette?s College, but he was also the author of four great books English with a Smile (Books 1, 2 & 3) Practical English, which is almost a vade mecum (Handbook kept constantly at hand) and a sine qua non ( Absolutely necessity) to students of English in Sri Lanka.
Mr Samaranayake has gone to his eternal rest, but he will live forever in his great books English with a Smile & Practical English, which as textbooks in Sri Lankan schools, have proved and will prove as invaluable guides to generations of teachers and students for years. The world has lost a great educationist, who was distinguished for his simplicity, his high sense of duty and integrity.
??The teaching profession is one of those silent walks of life, which a few self-sacrificed men and women have chosen to tread, for them not the blare of trumpets, or the glare of publicity, but a day to day, hard toil and moil?
?Fifty nine years of loneliness and pain,
?
We long to hear your voice again,
To hold your hand, to see your face,
To have you fill your vacant place.
But, when our hearts seem dark and drear,
?
Our heartbeat tells us you are near,
Still loving, helpful as before.
And that helps us to bear the blow.
God grant you rest is our heartfelt prayer,
?
We commit you to His care.?

Singapore says committed to benefit of SL?s common citizen
	
Singapore was committed to the benefit of the common citizen though some forces make misleading statements, Singaporean Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan had informed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, sources close to Prime Minister told journalists on Monday.
The Singaporean Minister has expressed this sentiment during the one-to-one meeting he held with Sri Lankan Prime Minister on the sidelines of ongoing third edition of Indian Ocean Conference in Hanoi.
Mr.Wickremesinghe had told the Singaporean Minister that the objective of the Yahapalana Government is to turn the country around from the political and economic set back it had suffered as a result of petty politics by some and their personal agendas.
Both leaders have focused on geopolitics during the discussion. (Yohan Perera in Vietnam)

SL-S'pore FTA must be a win-win process: Anura
	
Any Free Trade Agreement including the Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (SLSFTA) should be a win-win process for the both countries, MP Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said today.
At his maiden joint opposition (JO) news briefing, the former minister said the SLFTA was a different agreement unlike previous FTAs Sri Lanka signed with other countries.
?Previous FTAs only focused on import and export of goods but through the SLSFTA, the government has opened the domestic service sector to Singapore. Unlike a handful of services such as medical, legal and engineering, the rest of the services have no regulator or accreditation body to recognize employees especially in the hospitality sector. Therefore, anyone with only a certificate can find employment opportunities in Sri Lanka. The SLSFTA is more favourable to Singapore,? he said.
The MP said if any amendment was to be made to the FTA, Sri Lanka would have to go to Singapore for dispute settlement and most likely will have to pay compensation if any clause is to be changed.
JO MP Tharaka Balasuriya told the media conference that Sri Lanka's economy was on the verge of collapse and this has also been predicted by credit rating companies such as Moody?s.
He said the hospitality sector especially hotels have been badly affected by the government's fiscal mismanagement.
?Most of the tourists are now using service providers such as Airbnb instead of hotels. In the near future, the country will fail to settle the loans it had obtained and become a failed state,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

SriLankan airlines launches new ?Ready to Fly? on-time initiative
	
SriLankan airlines has launched a new ?Ready to Fly? programme to enhance its world-renowned customer service by providing increased punctuality levels of its flights around the world and requested co-operation from its valued passengers by boarding flights promptly.
The airline requested all its customers to, ? ?help us to help you? and be ?Ready to Fly? by arriving at the departure gate at least 40 minutes prior to the scheduled time of departure. Our new ?Ready to Fly? initiative is the result of feedback from a wide circle of customers. Not surprisingly, an on-time departure is one of the most important expectations of all our guests?
In order for an aircraft to depart ontime, the airline?s team works hard on all aspects of pre-flight preparation - this includes closing the doors in advance of scheduled departure time and making sure that the aircraft is ?Ready to Fly?. ?
To achieve our ?Ready to Fly? target, the departure gates will be strictly closed 20 minutes prior to the time of departure. Any guest arriving after this time will not be permitted to board the aircraft and their checked-in baggage will be removed from the flight.
The best rule of thumb is to arrive early to ensure adequate time for pre-flight processing and any other personal needs such as shopping or dining.

?Stressed, weeping?  pilot caused deadly Nepal plane crash
	
?
An investigation into a deadly plane crash at Nepal?s international airport has blamed the captain who wept and suffered an emotional breakdown during the flight after his skills had been questioned, according to a draft of the report leaked Monday.? ?
The March 12 flight from the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka crash-landed at Kathmandu airport and skidded into a football field where it burst into flames, killing 51 people in the deadliest aviation accident in the Himalayan nation for decades.? ?
The draft copy of the final investigation report, seen by AFP, concludes the US-Bangla Airlines captain was ?under stress and emotionally disturbed? after a female co-worker had ?questioned his reputation as a good instructor?.? ?
?This mistrust and stress led him to continuously smoke in the cockpit and also suffer an emotional breakdown several times during the flight,? it says.? ?
Captain Abid Sultan was ?crying and sneezing on several occasions during the flight?, it adds.? ?
During the short flight from Dhaka to Kathmandu, Sultan -- a former Bangladesh Air Force pilot who was also an instructor for the airline -- talked non-stop as he tried to impress upon the junior co-pilot his competence and proficiency.? ?
The captain?s constant monologue led to the ?total disorientation? of the co-pilot, who was flying the plane when it crashed. Prithula Rashid had only recently qualified and had never previously landed at Kathmandu airport.? ?
Nepal?s only international airport lies in a narrow bowl-shaped valley with the Himalayas to the north, making it a notoriously challenging place to land.

A certain white-collar high-up in charge of a Province was recently promoted to the top post in the Ministry, thanks to his closeness to a political authority.
His subordinates at district offices eager to cultivate the goodwill of the boss now elevated to higher status lost no time in organizing sendoffs to him.
Some white-collar ones at a district office had decided to say farewell to the boss at a function organized on a grand scale and collected a sizable amount to buy an expensive gift to be presented to the boss.

Why are US, Japan  and India making a beeline for Trincomalee  ?
	
India, US and Japan are making a beeline to Trincomalee and trying to convince the Sri Lankan government to accept their presence ?in Sri Lanka?s interest
Japanese destroyer Ikazuchi in Trincomallee
?
The port town of Trincomalee in Eastern Sri Lanka is known for its scenic beauty eminently qualified to be featured in the National Geographic Channel.
But historically,it has been noted for something very different - its strategic value as a naval base.??
Trincomalee?s military value had been grasped by world powers from the time of the Portuguese in the 17th Century. The Dutch, British, French, Indians, Americans and the Japanese have eyed it in succession.? ?
As on date, India, US and Japan are making a beeline to Trincomalee and trying to convince the Sri Lankan government to accept their presence ?in Sri Lanka?s interest,? citing a potential maritime security threat to it from expansionist China. This stems from the worry that China could threaten the present free and rule-based international maritime commerce in the ?Indo-Pacific region.???
In August, Trincomalee saw the USS Anchorage of the US Seventh Fleet with Marines on board drop anchor there to hold ?humanitarian? exercises with the Sri Lankan Navy. Coinciding with the first ever visit by a Japanese Defence Minister to Sri Lanka (including Trincomalee), the Japanese sent a destroyer Ikazuchi to berth there.? ?Asked why this is happening now, Sri Lanka?s leading maritime security expert, Adm. Dr. Jayanatha Colombage, said that with the Chinese exclusively ensconced in Hambantota port with a 70% stake and a 99 year lease on it, and having a container terminal at Colombo port also, the only port of value still available in Sri Lanka is Trincomalee.?
?
Although the British gave independence to Sri Lanka in 1948, they held on to the RAF base in Katunayake and the Royal Navy base in Trincomalee till 1957
Trinco Port?s Advantages
Trincomalee port has many advantages, Adm. Colombage said. It has been universally recognized as one of the ?finest harbours in the world?. It was Admiral Nelson who said that for the first time in 1775 when he sailed into it from Madras as a young midshipman on board the Royal Navy frigate HMS Seahorse. ?Trincomalee port has a natural depth of 25 metres and does not have to be dredged. This is a huge advantage in comparison with Hambantota and Colombo ports,? Colombage said.??
According to independent marine researcher, Howard Martenstyn, Trincomalee harbour with 2000 hectares, is ten times larger than Colombo harbour. During World War II,Trincomalee protected the British Seventh Fleet. This proved invaluable after the British lost their principal Asian naval base at Singapore in 1942.
Ideal for nuclear submarines
Trincomalee has immense significance in this age of nuclear weaponry and nuclear submarine-based missile systems also, points out Romesh Somasundaram, who has written on the strategic value of Trincomalee. ?Given the depth of the harbour, nuclear submarines are able to dive low within the inner harbour,? he says. Furthermore, Trincomalee has been functioning as naval base since colonial times. According to Martenstyn, in the 18th Century, the British believed that from Trincomalee a strong naval force could secure control of India?s Coromandel Coast (the Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh coastlines).? ?
The Dutch had built a fort, and in the 20th. Century, the British built an airfield, a naval base, a naval dockyard and also a huge oil storage facility with 101 giant oil tanks to supply both peacetime and wartime needs.??
During World War II, the Japanese knew the role that Trincomalee was playing in the defence of British interests in Sri Lanka and the Bay of Bengal and bombarded it in 1942. Over 700 people were killed when carrier based Japanese aircraft struck in April 1942. Sri Lanka tasted its suicide attack when one of the Japanese bombers plunged into an oil tank setting it ablaze. The fire raged for a week melting the tank which had a one inch thick protective steel wall.??
Trincomalee is nearest to the countries on the shores of the? Bay of Bengal such as India (Southern and Eastern part of it), Bangladesh and Myanmar. Trincomalee commands the entrance to the Bay of Bengal which is now gaining economic and strategic importance with the entry of China as an economic power in Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Bangladesh, points out Adm.Colombage. Trincomalee rather than Hambantota is nearer South East Asian ports ,he adds.? ?
Somasundaram shows how a lot of Sri Lankan history revolved around control over Trincomalee. It was the Portuguese Admiral, Alfonso Albuquerque, who first saw the value of Trincomalee and made it part of his grand design of having bases in far flung areas to control the vast expanse of the Indian Ocean and protect Portugal?s maritime and imperial interests.? ?
The Dutch took over Trincomalee from the Portuguese, beating the French to it though the latter had the sanction of the Kandyan King to possess Trincomalee. Subsequently, the British spent much time and energy seizing it from the Dutch.??
In the 18th century, when the King of Kandy wanted to get rid of the oppressive Dutch, he sent word to the British in Madras seeking help, and offering Trincomalee harbour as a bait.? Though the British wanted Trincomalee and sent emissary John Pybus to the Kandyan court, they were reluctant to take on the Dutch because they were at peace with the Dutch in Europe at that time. This reticence led to bad relations between the Kandyan King and the British.
But by 1780, Britain itself was at war with Holland and also with the French. This time, every effort was made to seize Trincomalee from the Dutch. When the British did seize Trincomalee, it became Britain?s first territorial possession in Sri Lanka.? ?
Interestingly, Trincomalee was also the last place in the island they gave up. Although the British gave independence to Sri Lanka in 1948, they held on to the RAF base in Katunayake and the Royal Navy base in Trincomalee till 1957. The nationalist government of SWRD Bandaranaike had asked?
them to leave.?
?
Trincomalee is nearest to the countries on the shores of the? Bay of Bengal such as India (Southern and Eastern part of it), Bangladesh and Myanmar. Trincomalee commands the entrance to the Bay of Bengal which is now gaining economic and strategic importance with the entry of China
?India Enters
By 1954, India was beginning to show an interest in Ceylon, albeit very tentatively. Somasundaram quotes an early Indian strategic thinker, R. R. Ramachandra Rao, as saying as early as in 1954, that India has ?very real interest in ensuring that no hostile power should establish itself in?Ceylon (Sri Lanka)?.
?
More pointedly, Ramachandra Rao said: ? Foreign airstrips and naval control of Trincomalee would unbearably expose the Indian peninsula to air and sea bombardment and assault along her extensive coasts. Ceylon is within Indian defence area, at the very heart centre of the Indian Ocean defence.??
?
In the 1980s, India feared encirclement by hostile forces. It had contradictions with China and the US, besides Pakistan. India feared that the pro-Western J.R. Jayewardene (JR) regime would soon make Sri Lanka a part of the anti-Indian Western alliance. India?s support for the minority Tamils in the island had alienated ?JR? from India.? ?
To add to India?s fears, in 1985, JR reminded British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher that the Defence pact the British had signed with Sri Lanka in 1947 was still there, not having been abrogated formally.??
These were among other reasons why India appended to the India-Sri Lanka accord of July 1987, an Exchange of Letters between President JR Jayewardene and Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi which?mentioned Trincomalee.? ?
Through the letters, the two leaders agreed that:(1) Trincomalee or any other port of Sri Lanka, would not be made available for military use by any country in a manner prejudicial to India?s interests. (2) the work of restoring and operating the Trincomalee oil tank farm would be undertaken as a joint venture between India and Sri Lanka.??
However, the tanks were handed over to India only in 2003 in exchange for supporting the Norwegian-brokered peace process in Sri Lanka to end the war with the separatist?Tamil militants.??
India has now been offered to chance to join Japan in developing the Trincomalee harbour and partner Singapore and Japan in developing the hinterland as an Economic Zone.??

Why Chinese influence is good for Sri Lanka Only if leaders know  how to make use of it
	
Last week, the Japanese Defence Minister was in Sri Lanka on a two-day visit, a first by a Japanese politician of that capacity to the island. Pacifist Japan did not have a habit of sending their defence top brass and warships to every other country, until very recently. In the same week, the Japanese naval ship ?Ikazuchi? arrived in the Trincomalee harbour on a goodwill visit. The vessel was part of a dispatch of three ships sent on a month-long tour to India, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines; a modest manoeuvering by Tokyo to assert the maritime role, as China is expanding its influence in the region.? ?
During his visit Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera toured all three major ports, Colombo, Hambantota and Trincomalee, a gesture one would feel a bit too intrusive, and later he told Japan?s NHK television, that Tokyo expects that the Hambantota port would be free of military activities. Japan?s emphasis on a ?free and open? Indo Pacific is rooted in much more than the freedom of navigation, Tokyo?s own rivalry with China over the contested Diaoyu/Senkaku islands and China?s expansive maritime posture in the region - according to some estimates China is building a 300 vessel strong fleet with 75 submarines which could contest American superiority in the region. Japan?s interest in Sri Lanka coincides with Japan?s own security interests, emanating from China?s rise, and the expansion of the Chinese influence in the region.? The rising China is espousing revisionist grievances, simultaneously, while exerting its influence through an unrivaled infrastructure building binge across the world. It is coaxing countries with its cheque book, at the same time bullying others who refused to kowtow. China?s rise and still untested intentions generate reactions from regional states, mainly India and Japan and reigning super power, America.
?Their collective response towards China has evolved into a soft balancing strategy of sort. Some other countries such as Vietnam and at times, Philippines and Singapore are playing a complementary role. Soft balancing is a mixture of collective security measures such as ad hoc military exercise, security partnerships, intelligence sharing, and collective behaviour at international forums built on shared strategic interests. Those measures can be converted into more overt hard balancing strategies of kinetic display if the security uncertainties in the international system heat up.? ?
However, with the presidency of Mr. Trump, who has a special penchant for picking fights with both allies and foes, and debasing and humiliating America?s treaty partners, Japan, for the first time since the World War II, has to find its own security. Recently, Japan was a mere observer of Mr. Trump?s romance with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. Now that the American president has reinforced sanctions on Iran, Japan which had geo-strategic interest in taking part with India in the development of Iran?s Chabahar port, which in someways is a rival for the Chinese funded Gwadar port, finds its strategic concerns are in conflict with mercurial Mr. Trump.??
Japan has pinned hopes on India as a counterweight to China, and has been a permanent member of the Malabar naval exercise, also involving America to which it sent its largest helicopter carrier last year. Japan and India have also offered an alternative to China?s one belt one road strategy. Dubbed Asia-Africa growth corridor, the Indian and Japanese economic balancing initiative aims to build, just like OBOR, an infrastructure corridor, facilitating connectivity in the region. Though the intention has been to cynic Japan?s technological sophistication with India?s scale, the initiative has made little headway, and is more likely to be a victim of inherent bureaucratic lethargy in India, and economic pickiness of Japan.??
Also during the last week, an American naval ship, one of the many that came recently, arrived in Trincomalee port for a joint exercise. Those visits though modest are part of a broader American strategy to deepen its footprint in Asia Pacific, which it has re-christened as Indo-Pacific to highlight the strategic importance in the Indian Ocean region.? ?Sri Lanka cannot insulate itself from these systemic forces. They take their own course, with or without our participation. The only difference would be, if you shun systemic forces, you deprive yourself? even the remotest possibility to make use of them to advance one?s interests.? ?
Some local commentators tend to view this increased international attention as a disturbance to our idyllic solitude. Foreign policy pundits describe the government policy as an aberration of the traditional foreign policy of non-alignment. Naysayers warn that the government is auctioning strategic assets to foreign powers. Others forewarn Sri Lanka would become a Chinese colony. And no surprise, there are enough fools in this country to believe all of that.? ?
There are two ways to view the on-going power transition and fickle systemic conditions courtesy of China?s meteoric rise.??
?
Naysayers and traditional non-aligned types see a danger in this systemic uncertainty. Others of the realist pragmatism sense an opportunity . Sri Lanka should listen to the latter type. Unfortunately, we and many countries of similar cultural and colonial heritage are full of the former, who espouse the old garbage of an insular and reactive foreign policy as received wisdom . This foreign policy tradition which often went hand in glove with a far more disastrous economic policy of statism, sometimes dubbed a middle path, was the bane of much of the post independent colonial states. Their leaders from Nehru to Kenneth Kaunda, to Sirimavo, build a larger than life personal image at the expense of their countries, and left their people swollen bellied, miserable, often living in hand-to-mouth off the American food aid.? ?
However, the long association of this outlook with foreign service officials, politicians, and academia plus the inherent poverty of that ideology to reform, have blinded the foreign policy of those countries. Thus the rot is self-regenerating.??
On the other hand, countries such as South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Chile, that exploited those systemic conditions of the cold war, have not only secured their security, but also economic prosperity.??
China?s rise has also created unparalled systemic opportunities, unseen since the hey days of the cold war of the 1960s. And unlike the cold war rivalry, where two distinctive ideologies were at logger heads, the difference in the unfolding competition is much more nuanced. Liberal market policies have prevailed over the rest. And China is not keen on exporting its brand of political system. Its expansion is subtle and is primarily economic, though economic power is generally the reservoir of all other forms of power resources.??
China wants the countries to acknowledge its new found clout, and is willing to pay in gold for their solidarity - though its unremitting loan tap itself has created a debt trap when it is unleashed on states which lack internal economic accountability, like ex-President Mahinda Rajapaksa?s vestige projects have proved to be.??
However, it was also Mr. Rajapaksa who decisively exploited the systemic opportunity when it just emerged. Without that manoeuvering, we could still be looking for a lender for the Katunayake Expressway? or the Southern Expressway.??
It was also the Chinese interest in the island, and later the leasing of the Hambantota Port, that generated the international attention and their desire to pro-actively engage with Sri Lanka. Otherwise, this country was a backwater which, nobody cared. That lack of interest was hardwired to our proximity to India and India?s extended interest in its sphere of influence which none of the other major powers wanted to contest. However, for most part of its recent history, India has been abysmally poor, and not only did it reign over a sphere of partly self- inflicted poverty, it also prevented other countries from escaping poverty, as the Indian funded insurgency did to Sri Lanka just after Colombo embraced free market economic policies.??
?
The rising China is espousing revisionist grievances, simultaneously, while exerting its influence through an unrivaled infrastructure building binge across the world.
Mr. Rajapaksa broke that mould, and since then the Sri Lankan foreign policy has been much bolder.? ?
This does not mean that Sri Lanka should bandwagon with China. Nor does it, that it should shun the American, Indian or Japanese strategic interests in the island. The current power competition is nuanced to the extent that Sri Lanka can pick and choose where it can cooperate and where it would not. At the end, the emerging China-led economic system, if it ever materializes, would have more in similarity with the prevailing US led system than differences. Both are rooted in the free trade -- though China?s implementation of that may be problematic, those aberrations are more likely to wither way as the country socializes with the trading systems.??
Sri Lanka should also not overstate its strategic significance. Strategic importance of small countries is only to the extent that they are willing to play a role in the strategic power play. Sri Lanka should play that role with its long term national interest in mind. National interest for a country like Sri Lanka is first and foremost of its long-term economic wellbeing. Imaginary security implications of such economic interests should not be exaggerated. In the current international system, sovereignty is, by and large, given. Whereas, economic prosperity should be acquired through hard work and ingenuity.??
The greatest challenge for Sri Lanka in exploiting those systemic conditions to advance its national interest, is other than the Indian sensitivities, is its own internal lethargy and discord. Sri Lanka has failed to exploit the opportunities of trade integration. Proposed free trade agreements are mired in protracted and often pointless negotiations. Land acquisition and regulatory approval for infrastructure projects are painstaking to obtain. The government has failed to create a predictable environment for investment. Instead, it has gone back on a number of large-scale agreements, and has shown a serial addiction to re-negotiate agreements for an umpteenth time. Unless the country fixes this rotten internal system, Sri Lanka is more likely to be a mere observer of the current flow of systemic opportunities.??

An additional secretary for each ministry to implement bilateral pacts
	
Steps have been taken to appoint an additional secretary to each ministry to evaluate and implement bilateral agreements entered into during the President?s foreign visits, the President?s Media Division (PMD) said.
This matter has been discussed at a meeting between President Maithripala Sirisena and ministry secretaries on Monday.
The President has emphasized the need for ministry secretaries to play a vital role to optimize the government's development process.
He has also reviewed the progress of the development programmes implemented at ministerial level.
Another matter which had been reportedly discussed was with regard to programmes implemented, submitting new proposals to promote government revenue, creating new income avenues, contributions to the national economy and expenditure management of state institutions.
The President pointed out the need to streamline public relations and emphasized the importance of giving prominence to the resolution of the grievances and requests of the people.
He said it was mandatory that on Wednesdays the ministry secretaries should be in their offices to meet the public.
Moreover, the President stressed the importance of maintaining a website and regularly interrelating the information between the ministry's official duties and the development plans.
He said it was the duty of the ministry secretary to reduce the cost of living and provide benefits to people by taking vital decisions to provide the public with a better livelihood.
Presidential Secretary Udaya R. Seneviratne was also present at the meeting.

REUTERS, 27th AUGUST, 2018-President Emmanuel Macron on Monday said preserving European Union unity was more important than forging a close relationship with post-Brexit Britain, and hit out at what he called U.S. President Donald Trump?s ?aggressive? isolationism.??
Macron, who met Prime Minister Theresa May for talks on Britain?s departure from the EU during the summer holiday, said he wanted to reach a Brexit deal by the end of the year and showed no signs of breaking ranks with other EU capitals.??
?France wants to maintain a strong, special relationship with London but not if the cost is the European Union?s unravelling,? he told a gathering of French ambassadors.??
Brexit, Macron said, ?is a sovereign choice, which we must respect, but it can?t come at the expense of the European Union?s integrity.???
In a one-and-a-half hour speech outlining his diplomatic priorities for the year ahead, Macron made no major policy shifts, but spoke forcefully on what he labelled the ?crisis of multilateralism? and the need to make Europe more ?sovereign?.??
Macron called on Europe to be ?a trade and economic power?, which defends its strategic interests and financial independence with tools that can fend off U.S. extraterritorial sanctions.??
?Multilateralism is going through a major crisis which collides with all our diplomatic activity, above all because of U.S. policy,? he said.?
