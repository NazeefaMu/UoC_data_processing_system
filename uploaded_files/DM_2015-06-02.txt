Australia turned back 54 SL asylum seekers
	
	Australian customs turned back 65 people, including a pregnant woman, after their boat reached Australian waters last Tuesday, according to an Indonesian police chief.
	The 65 people from Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Myanmar, who reportedly claimed to be asylum seekers, are in detention on the Indonesian island of Rote.
	Fishermen spotted two boats floating near an island in the West Rote district, 500 kilometres north-east of the Australian coast, on Sunday.

	"They looked exhausted," Rote police chief Hidayat said. "One female passenger is pregnant  we took her immediately to the hospital but she is ok now."
	Mr Hidayat said the migrants told him they had been caught by Australian customs on May 26, put in two blue and white boats, and sent back into Indonesian waters.
	"The Australians provided them with food, drinks and sufficient fuel to reach Indonesian land," Mr Hidayat said.
	He said the passengers included four women and three toddlers. Of the 65, 54 were from Sri Lanka, 10 from Bangladesh and one from Myanmar.
	They had started out from Pelabuhan Ratu in West Java on May 24 and were intercepted by Australian customs two days later.
	Mr Hidayat said Indonesian police had arrested four of the six crew members. The captain, Yohanes, ran away. "He's part of the smuggler network in Jakarta, according to the boat crews," Mr Hidayat said. There was confusion over the whereabouts of the sixth crew member, with some suggesting he was with Australian customs, although it was unclear what that meant.
	West Timor Care Foundation chairman Ferdi Tanoni said the migrants were expected to be transferred on Tuesday to Kupang, West Timor's largest town and the capital of Nusa Tenggara Timur province.
	"According to the chief of immigration, the information they received was that these people wanted to go to Australia to ask for asylum," Mr Tanoni told Fairfax Media.
	Although there is an immigration detention centre on Kupang, Mr Tanoni said it was full and the asylum seekers were likely to be accommodated in hotels.
	A spokesman for Immigration spokesman Peter Dutton said: "The Australian does not comment on matters associated with on-water operations."
	The Australian navy has repeatedly turned back boats with asylum seekers on board after Prime Minister Tony Abbott came to power in 2013 vowing to "stop the boats".
	The hardline tactic was also initially employed by Malaysia and Indonesia during the recent humanitarian crisis in the Bay of Bengal after boatloads of Rohingya and Bangladeshi migrants were stranded at sea following a Thai crackdown on people trafficking.
	The crackdown led to people smugglers abandoning the boats at sea, leading to deaths and starvation.
	Malaysia and Indonesia later agreed to assist the migrants and asylum seekers and provide shelter for up to a year but insisted the international community had to help with their resettlement. (smh.com.au)

British Tamil forum seeks India's help in SL
	
	London: A representative group of Britain- based Tamils has sought India's help for Tamils based in northern Sri Lanka in improving their lives through a host of measures.
	The British Tamil Forum, which claims to represent nearly 4,00,000 from the community living in the UK, met officials of the Indian High Commission in London last week and sought positive measures for the Tamils who are "first Sri Lankan but do have an affinity to India".
	"The meeting went very well and whilst the Indian government will be keen to help in partnership with the Sri Lankan government for all such positive efforts, the point was made and unanimously applauded that peaceful and diplomatic avenues only remain our work-ethic base," said Anil Bhanot, managing director of Hindu Council UK - the charity which facilitated the meeting.
	Some of the suggested measures included psychological and psychiatric help for the Tamils in the region, particularly women, apparently affected during the nearly three decade-long brutal war against the LTTE, besides setting up of Indian education institutions branches.
	They also included a bridge between Rameshwaram in India and a northern Sri Lankan port for easier movement of goods and services and people with the appropriate controls; and a ferry service, that existed before the war, should be resumed.
	The British Tamil Forum, an advocacy group, had recently also launched a petition calling on the UK government to take up the Tamil cause in the United Nations. (ndtv)

Drugs systematically introduced to Tamil youth: C.V
	
	Narcotic drugs had been introduced in the province in a systematic manner with the intention of preventing a youth-resurgence, Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran charged today.
	Addressing a prize giving ceremony of a cricket tournament held in Jaffna, the Chief Minister said some of the State officials and ministers had the opinion previously that Tamil youths should not be get together as idea of rebelling could arise in them.
	Those ministers believed that no ideas on liberation should arise in the hearts of youths and that they should behave like zombies, he said.
	He said that northern youth had put pressure on previous governments by taking up arms and the previous governments had to incur a large expenditure with foreign aid to put an end to the armed conflict. (Pradeep Kumara-Jaffna)

Faster run from Kaduwela to Kadawatha
	
	The second phase of the Outer Circular Highway (OCH), the 14.3 Km stretch from Kaduwela to Kadawatha is to be opened for public use on June 20, Project Director Mrs. T. S. H. Abeywickrama said yesterday.
	The construction of the OCH is being carried out in three phases, Phase 1 from Kottawa to Kaduwela was declared open last year, Phase 2, from Kaduwela to Kadawatha; and Phase 3 from Kadawatha to Kerawalapitiya.
	The construction is almost completed. Unlike the other expressways, we have taken measures to ensure greater safety. These days, we are trying to complete such work before the deadline, Mrs. Abewickrama said.
	Meanwhile, she said due to accidents and difficulties people had to face when travelling on the other expressways, measures had been taken to reduce accidents. Accordingly, new technical inclusions and strategies have been used when constructing the second phase of the OCH.
	The building of the second phase commenced in 2012 at an estimated cost of Rs. 49 billion. The four lane expressway will have 3 toll buildings and 6 toll plazas.
	Mrs. Abewickrama said that the authorities have informed that this phase would be opened on June 20 but, some of small scale work is still being carried out. Therefore, she said that the date was not certain.
	According to the Road Development Authority (RDA) plan, the OCH will be developed as a four-lane highway with provision for future expansion to 6-lanes. The design speed of the highway is 100 kmph. (Piyumi Fonseka)

MS to meet NMSJ on electoral reforms
	
	With the National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ) led by Ven. Maduluwave Sobitha Thera urging the enactment of electoral reforms, President Maithripala Sirisena will hold a special meeting tomorrow with representatives of this group to discuss the way froward.
	The NMSJ and some other civil society groups had earlier requested both the President and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to enact the electoral reforms through the 20th Amendment to the Constitution before dissolving parliament.
	The United National Party (UNP) wants parliament dissolved and and fresh elections conducted. However, there are groups from inside and outside the government urging the enactment of electoral reforms before such a move. The President has also worked out a concept paper in this regard proposing to increase the number of MPs to 255. (Kelum Bandara)

Ravi challenges MR on his economic policies
	
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake today accepted UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardenas challenge to a debate on the economic crisis and in turn challenged former president and finance minister Mahinda Rajapaksa to a debate on his governments economic policies which resulted in the country being mired in an economic crisis.
The minister said he accepted the challenge because it was only ethical and reasonable that he took part in a debate with a person of a similar interenst in the subject.
This is why as the current finance minister I challenge the former finance minister to a debate. Mr. Rajapksa is a major critic of the current economic policies. I like to debate on the subject of how the previous administration ruled this country for 12 years and ruined its economy. It is because of the political interference and mismanagement by the Rajapaksa regime that the economy is in ruins, he told Daily Mirror.
The minister said he hoped the former president would come forward to address these issues and pointed out that if he was worried, concerned or unable to accept the challenge then Mr. Rajspaksa could send his mouthpiece Bandula Gunawardena to the debate.
The minister said opposition members were at a loose end unaware of what steps to take next and that was why they were challenging him to a debate and planing to submit a no-confidence motion against him.
Various elements keep throwing challenges but we have done so much to revive and maintain the economy during these 120 days, he said.
On Saturday, Mr. Gunawardena challenged either the minister or Policy Planning and Economic Development Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva to a debate on the current economic crisis in the country.
The deputy minister has accepted the challenge and said Mr. Gunawardena had gone missing soon after. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

DLF Leader Vasudeva Nanayakkara today challenged United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) General Secretary Susil Premajayantha to announce whether he supported the political cohabitation between President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Mr. Nanayakkara told Daily Mirror that the President, despite being the UPFA Chairman, was having a political powwow with the UNP leadership.
In fact, we, as UPFA allies wanted an end to this cohabitation and form a formidable political force against the UNP. Mr. Premajayantha should announce whether he supports the political understanding between the President and the Prime Minister. Otherwise, he should announce whether he is against it, he said.
Mr. Nanayakkara was responding to a statement issued by Mr. Premajayantha that parties not represented in the UPFA Executive Committee should refrain from making policy announcements. (Kelum Bandara)

	Police Media Spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara said today the threat by UPFA Southern Provincial Council Minister D.V. Upul to stone to death the officers of the FCID when Mahinda Rajapaksa returns to power was of little no concern to them.
	He said such threats by politicians of this calibre were of no consequence because the Financial Crime Investigation Department was carrying out its duties in an impartial and professional manner without prejudice or bias.
	He had threatened to stone FCID officers to death. We only consider it as a comment of a politician. Police are not bothered because we have so many other important duties to carry out, he said with a loud laugh.
	Even though no legal action has been taken by the police over the remarks of Mr. Upul, ASP Gunasekara said he would consult Police Chief N.K. Ilangakoon on how best to respond to these threats.(Piyumi Fonseka)
