Undue political influence inflicted on witness: ACF
	
In a bid to provide false evidence on the Rajagiriya accident where a man was knocked down by a vehicle allegedly belonging to the Ministry of Mr. Patali Champika Ranawaka, undue political influence have been inflicted on the witness of the accident, the Anti Corruption Front (ACF) charged today.
ACF Legal division Chief Namal Rajapakse who came up with this allegation told a media briefing yesterday that he requested the Inspector General of Police (IGP) to carry out a complete investigation on the incident in an impartial and transparent manner.
In a letter addressed to the IGP, Mr. Rajapakse had mentioned that certain politicians had taken effort to publish maps of the accident which they cannot do so, as a case was pending in the Magistrate courts as per a B statement.
The letter further stated that the said politicians would offer the youth foreign employment if he provided evidence on their favour.
In his letter, Mr. Rajapakse had added that the youth who witnessed the accident had planned to move to New Zealand before long, and hence, he had requested the IGP to get the courts to impound his passport until the case was completed. He had also informed the IGP to confiscate the 1,000 CC motorbikes involved in the collision, as bikes with such an engine capacity was not permitted to be motored in Sri Lanka.
Meanwhile, the Anti Corruption Front mentioned that they had made a written request to the IGP to investigate into an accident which had taken place on June 29, 2014, where a man was knocked down by a vehicle driven by MP Udaya Gammanpilas wife. Sources said the parliamentarian had been a Provincial Minister during that time. (Yohan Perera)
