A bid to buy luxury furnishings for an empty residence!
	

A tender calling for bids to supply some expensive items for the official residence of a provincial chief of a council already dissolved was rejected by the governing one when it was submitted to him for approval the other day, they say.

The governing one, pointing out that it was a crime to spend millions on luxury items for the official residence at a time the council was dissolved, had angrily torn up into pieces the documents submitted to him for approval.
The officials had decided to purchase new furnishings for the official residence as the outgoing Chief had taken away all items when leaving the place, they say.

Big countries in IOR need SL's help: SL Navy
	
The big countries in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) need Sri Lankas assistance to face maritime security threats and similarly Sri Lanka needs the assistance of other countries, Sri Lanka Navy said today.
Navy Chief of Staff Rear Admiral Piyal De Silva said this at a media briefing held at the Navy Headquarter on the 9th Galle Dialogue organised by the Navy.
We can not act alone in the ocean. We have a large sea area to cover. North and Western seas are the major sea routes used for drugs smuggling. We were able to thwart several attempts by drug smugglers, he said.
Commenting on the detection in the IOR, he said a total of 28 tonnes of hashish and two tonnes of heroin which had a street value of US$1.8 billion was seized in the IOR by the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) this year
These checks had been conducted outside the Sri Lankan maritime region. Some of them might have been heading towards Sri Lanka. Although the Sri Lanka Navy was not a part of the detection, SL Navy joins the navies of other countries to combat drug trafficking, human smuggling and illegal fishing in our waters and in the Indian Ocean as well,the Navy Chief of Staff said.
Meanwhile, commenting on the 9th Galle Dialogue, he said it would be held in Colombo on October 22 and 23 under the theme Synergizing for Collaborative Maritime Management.
World-wide maritime partners from 50 countries and 17 international organizations are expected to make their presence in this year's event with President Maithripala Sirisena participating as the chief guest.
This year event expects to attract an audience of 137 foreign participants including Myanmar Navy Commander, Maldivian and Seychelles Coast Guard chiefs.
The ocean has got many resources that can open up a wide range of prospects for prosperity.
Rear Admiral Piyal De Silva said this dialogue would be an ideal platform to discuss common issues pertinent to the navies around the world and share their hard-earned experience among each other.

Countering 'Awa': Security tightened in Jaffna
	
The Police have taken steps to strengthen the security in Jaffna town as a means of putting an end to the attacks and robberies allegedly committed by the AWA group.
They have set up road blocks and check points where random checks would be carried out on vehicles and their occupants.
Police said some 40 people were arrested during raids conducted by 500 police personnel in Jaffna, Manipay, Chunnakam and Kopai. They said among were some who had arrest warrants against them, some who were and absconding courts and drunken drivers.
Referring to the security situation in the North, Northern Provincial Council Chairman C.V.K. Sivagnanam said the security forces should take steps to arrest those who pose a threat to the peoples freedom but it should not cause any harassment to innocent people.
"When the residents of Jaffna are living in fear of the AWA and other armed groups, the steps taken by the police to check the people, their bags and the identities has created a situation similar to the one that prevailed during the war. If this situation is allowed the battalions now confined to barracks also could enter the roadways and intensify these raids. Therefore the police should adopt a more people-friendly action to counter the threats posed by the so-called armed groups," Mr. Sivagnanam said.(Romesh Madushanka)

The convener of the Movement for a Just Society, Prof Sarath Wijesuriya said he would urge the government to remove the Rs.5,000 notes from circulation as a remedy to the present Economic Crisis faced by Sri Lanka.
He said this at a Media Briefing held at the head office of the Movement for a Just Society in Rajagiriya and instead of cutting down on imports,it was better to stop functions being held to boost the image of politicians by spending colossal sums of money.
Prof. Wijesuriya said the late Dr N.M. Perera as the then Minister of Finance introduced the demonetization of the Rs.100 and Rs.50 notes in the face of a severe Economic Crisis, which compelled those who had hidden black money in gunny bags and trunks to be brought out. He said we could do the same and by withdrawing the Rs.5000 notes from circulationto ease the crisis.
There is information that earnings from various forms of informal activities are been stacked and kept in gunnies in several places. Even in some Temples and with Politicians there is evidence that Rs 5000 notes are safely stacked in bundles and there is proof that these hidden notes could fill in a Container, he said further.

The constant media publicity that a young opposition Diyawanna politico from Rajarata is getting has irked his party colleagues.

They have found that this young politico figures in news stories in the print and electronic media practically every day. Very often a TV channel or a national newspaper would publicize a comment he makes on some topical national issue.
The colleagues have even complained to the party leadership that the young politico is going out of the way to hog the limelight.

Hambantota as forward Chinese military base:  Distraction from real problem
	

Americas Vice-President Mike Pence has warned that Hambantota may soon become a forward military base for the PLA Navy. In a speech at Hudson institute, Pence launched a broadside against Chinas predatory trade, debt diplomacy, coercion and military aggression; he referenced to the Chinese-funded Hambantota port, of which the majority stake is owned by Chinas state owned port operator, China Merchants. Though these concerns are usual American refrain, the latest might have much do with buttressing President Trumps plan to levy taxes on an additional US $ 250 billion of Chinese imports and play the tough guy before America goes to the mid- term elections. After all America under Trump is retreating from AsiaPacific, and slapping taxes on its alliance partners, and is sending mixed signals on its
alliance commitments.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has rebuffed those claims - Some people are seeing imaginary Chinese naval bases in Sri Lanka, he had said speaking at the Oxford Union.
American concerns of China manipulating regional geopolitics through its construction spree date back to the early 2000. In 2004, American defence contractor Booz Allen Hamilton argued that China is building spring of pearls, potentially turning littoral states (such as Sri Lanka, Maldives, Bangladesh and Pakistan) into outposts of a maritime design. Since then this argument has been liberally deployed to characterize the Chinese construction activities in the region. China has in fact undertaken major port building projects and construction activities such as Gwadar in Pakistan, Hambantota and a shallow water port in Chittagong. Chinas flagship project in Pakistan,China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC) among other amenities, offers, China an all -weather land route to the Arabian sea, via Chinese built Karakolum highway. However, Chinas investment in headline- grabbing geostrategic projects are a fraction of the total Chinese investment in the region. For instance, over 75% of Chinas official development assistance to Pakistan during 2000 to 2014 was spent on power plants. Similarly, in Sri Lanka,67% of Chinese development loans obtained during 2010-2015 were spent on roads, and another 15% on power and energy. 
Predatory or not, Chinese loans are less concessionary in nature. The lions share of Chinese loans does not count as official development assistance, which need to be concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25% The ODA component of Chinese development assistance extended during the period of 2000-2015 to Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan is 7, 15, 27 and 9% respectively, based on data available on Aid data project.
However, mercantilism of loans and alleged claims of geopolitical designs of projects are quite apart. Countries borrow from China not just because money comes with no strings in the form of preconditions of political and economic reforms, attached. China is, in fact, filling a gap in demand and supply for infrastructure funding. The western financing for infrastructure projects have declined steadily since early 2000, and there exists an approximately US $2 trillion deficit in the global infrastructure budget. South Asia itself has to invest around US $ 2.5 trillion by 2020 to upgrade its infrastructure. 

In each country that China cultivated a thaw, that relationship has unravelled with the domestic political change. In SL, the collapse of the Rajapaksa regime saw the suspension of Chinese funded projects
Sheer scale of the Chinese economy and extent of its loans provides for greater economic presence for China in the region. However, the process of converting the material power into influence is not linear. Power resources in their utilization to achieve preferred state goals are subjected to and are conditioned by rigours of other extraneous details such as quarrelsome domestic politics, popular impulses and electoral calculations etc. That is where much of the fear- mongering over the Chinese presence is faulty. In each country that China cultivated a thaw, that relationship has unravelled with the domestic political change. In Sri Lanka, the collapse of the Rajapaksa regime saw the suspension of Chinese funded projects. Recently in the Maldives, the defeat of pro-Beijing former president Yameen in the recent election saw the Indian Ocean atolls renewing its vows of allegiance to India. In Malaysia, Dr. Mahathir Mohammed is scrapping a multi-billion dollars worth Chinese funded rail project.
However, it is also the weak states, their capricious fiscal policies and domestic institutions that make these countries potential targets of geopolitical designs. Giving Hambantota port on a 99- year lease was not a Chinese demand, but was a decision made by the current government in the pretext of easing debt service cost. That was after the same government, increased public sector salaries by Rs. 10,000 causing an implosion of government spending. Implications of those populist decisions are still felt. A saner economic policy could have saved the country from these troubles and their potential geo political complications.
South Asias political duopoly also makes it easier for the incumbent government to borrow as much as they want, and build vestige projects, and pass the buck of debt servicing to its predecessor. Mahinda Rajapaksa invested a sizeable portion of Chinese loans in projects which lacked immediate to medium term economic viability. And boisterous public reactions also make it harder to undertake requisite adjustments to turn such projects into profitable ventures. South Asia has a track record for protesting against its own economic interests. However, these domestic impulses, and Indian security concerns also tend to push back against China whenever it digresses from the implied economic role. South Asias domestic systems do not create conducive domain conditions for enhanced defence cooperation with an eye on balance of power manoeuvering.
However, the preponderance of Chinese economic presence and influence is worrying for that it cultivates an exceeding level of dependency on China by small countries, which are often forced to do so due to the absence of other alternatives. As things stand, neither America , nor Europe is in a position to offer a substantial economic balancing to China in South Asia. From Chinese merchandisers to mega construction projects, this influence is growing day by day. New Pax Sinica is more likely to be heralded by those commercial ventures than gunboats. Whether that new order would serve the interests of smaller states would be decided by how those states strategize their relationship with China for mutual gain. But, small countries, Sri Lanka being a classic case, lack a long term vision, and cohesive and effective apparatus to implement policy. This aggravates the unequal status quo in their relationship with China, and relative gains of their partnership. More than the prospect of Chinese gunboats in Hambantota, Sri Lankans ( and South Asians) should worry about their weak states and feeble institutions, which give them a raw deal in their workings with China.

Jpura Pradeepa Pranama  2018 On Oct. 17 at Waters Edge
	

Jpura Pradeepa Pranama 2018 will be held on October 17 at Waters Edge, Battaramulla, in the presence of President Maithripala Sirisena. This is the third consecutive event which is now considered important by the Alumni Association of Sri Jayewardenepura University.
Looking back at the history of the event, it was a decision of the alumni to hold an occasion where they can identify personalities born from the university, who have succeeded in different fields and have gained recognition in society. The university always expects the raw graduates who step out into society to contribute towards its betterment. Once these grads leave the university and start working for the public or private sector, it is quite evident that their knowledge and performance reflect the university education they gained. Therefore, Jpura Pradeepa Pranama is a great platform in which not only those who have excelled in different fields and brought pride to the university are felicitated, but also for the present generation to gain an inspiration from.
In the past two years, Jpura Pradeepa Pranama has identified about 80 alumni among top government servants and venerable monks who have contributed immensely to the progress of Buddhism. The annual awards ceremonies were held in the presence of President Maithripala Sirisena at Waters Edge. Each year, the selection of the awardees was done under the supervision of a qualified panel of judges.
Jpura Pradeepa Pranama aims at two main purposes; to identify the personalities born from the university who had contributed to the betterment of the society and to inspire the younger generation of the university by showing them what they are capable of. This year, the awardees are different from those feted in previous years. They are mainly from the fields of literature, cinema, print and electronic media. Among them are novelists, composers of songs, producers of teledramas, film producers, actors and musicians. The alumni will also commemorate personalities who are no longer with us such as the late renowned writer Somaweera Senanayake. In the future, the alumni are aiming at felicitating those who have gained recognition in education, administration, business and other fields.

Koreas hold  high-level peace talks
	

REUTERS, 15th OCTOBER, 2018- North and South Korea agreed on Monday to begin reconnecting rail and road links, another step in an improving relationship that has raised U.S. concern about the possible undermining of its bid to press the North to give up its nuclear programme.
The agreement on transport links came during talks in the border village of Panmunjom aimed at following up on the third summit this year between South Koreas President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, last month. The South and North reached the agreement after sincerely discussing action plans to develop inter-Korean relations to a new, higher stage, said a joint statement released by the Souths Unification Ministry.
They agreed to hold ceremonies in late November or early December to inaugurate work on reconnecting the railways and roads that have been cut since the 1950-53 Korean War.
The two sides will carry out joint field studies on the transport plans from late this month, according to the statement.

Mattis trip to Vietnam aimed at countering Chinas influence
	

THE HINDU, 15th OCTOBER, 2018- By making a rare second trip this year to Vietnam, Defence Secretary Jim Mattis is signaling how intensively the Trump administration is trying to counter Chinas military assertiveness by cozying up to smaller nations in the region that share American wariness about Chinese intentions.
The visit beginning on Tuesday also shows how far U.S.-Vietnamese relations have advanced since the tumultuous years of the Vietnam War.
Mr. Mattis, a retired general who entered the Marine Corps during Vietnam but did not serve there, visited Hanoi in January. By coincidence, that stop came just days before the 50th anniversary of the Tet Offensive in 1968. Tet was a turning point when North Vietnamese fighters attacked an array of key objectives in the South, surprising Washington and feeding anti-war sentiment even though the Norths offensive turned out to be a tactical military failure.
Three months after the Mattis visit, an U.S. Navy aircraft carrier, the USS Carl Vinson, made a port call at Da Nang. It was the first such visit since the war and a reminder to China that the U.S. is intent on strengthening partnerships in the region as a counterweight to Chinas growing military might.
The most vivid expression of Chinese assertiveness is its transformation of contested islets and other features in the South China Sea into strategicmilitary outposts.

The Natural Hazards Early Warning Centre said heavy showers above 100mm are expected at some places while temporarily strong gusty winds up to 70-80 kmph are also possible during thunder-showers.
The Department advised people to seek shelter, preferably indoors and never under trees. It also advised people to avoid open areas such as paddy fields, tea plantations and open water bodies during thunderstorms.
People should avoid using wired telephones and connected electric appliances and using open vehicles, such as bicycles, tractors and boats during thunder-showers, it said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

#MeToo makes its entry into pandals
	

New Delhi, (Hindustan Times), 15 Oct 2018 - As the city gears up for the festival of Durga puja as well as Ram Leela, devotees thronging the pandals and the grounds set to burn Ravana effigies across the capital will be greeted by themes of women empowerment  inspired by the ongoing #MeToo movement that has taken the country by a storm.
At the Lanka Dahan in Red Fort, a fourth effigy  symbolic of the men accused of sexually harassing women in the online campaign  will also go up in flames.
Rahul Sharma, press secretary of the Nav Shri Dharmik Leela Committee, said, Every year, we burn the effigy of one social evil. This time, we are focussing on symbolically destroying the evil that has been exposed by the #MeToo movement.

Name boards in Jaffna causing confusion
	
People in Jaffna have complained that name boards on roads and several state departments in the district had been wrongly translated into Sinhala and urged the authorities to rectify them immediately.
They said the name boards had been changed based on a decision taken by the Northern Provincial Council.
Northern Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran is reported to have instructed the authorities to change the names of villages and other places giving priority to Tamil with Sinhala and English given lesser prominence.
The people said pilgrims were often misled by the wrongly written Sinhala name boards. (Romesh Madushanka)

Nothing official about IGP's resignation: Nalin Bandara
	
Responding to speculation that Inspector General of Police (IGP) Pujith Jayasundara was to resign, Law and Order Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara said today he had not officially informed the Ministry or the President about any such move.
There is a mounting pressure from different groups that the IGP should either step down or be sacked over his recent conduct.
The deputy minister told a news briefing, that the IGP must have been disgusted by the remarks made by certain responsible people against him.
He is free to resign if he wishes to do so. We have not asked him to resign or to act in a particular manner, he said. The Police is often criticized by the people. However, as far the current police are concerned, they have not engaged in killings or other questionable acts."
Meanwhile, he revealed that there were divisions among the members of the joint opposition with regard to their presidential candidate.
Some MPs believe that Gotabaya Rajapaksa should be the next presidential candidate whereas some say it should be either Chamal Rajapaksa or Basil Rajapaksa. It seems there will be an imminent split in the JO, he said.
Kumara Welgama believes that Gotabaya should keep out. This has led to a crisis in the JO. Hence, Mahinda Rajapaksa has instructed MPs like Mahindananda Aluthgamage and Dilum Amunugama to criticize Welgama and speak against him at a recent event." (Sheain Fernandopulle)

 Our people are averse to a new Government 
	
I think it is a wrong decision by the SLFP to team up with the UNP at this hour
	There is a leader who is adored by even small kids - that is former President Mahinda Rajapaksa
	I am a well-matured politician
	People live with the hope that the Government would be unseated soon
	A person more dynamic than I should be fielded as the presidential candidate

Former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa, in an interview with the Daily mirror , spoke about the proposed move to form a new Government and the next presidential candidate.
Excerpts:
QThere are talks about an interim Government to be formed if President Maithripala Sirisena and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa come to an understandin. What do you think about it
Personally, I think there is a crisis situation in the country. Every segment of society- businessmen, ordinary people, village folk etc- has felt the pinch. Their economies have declined. There is insufficient business for traders. Businessmen are overburdened by taxation. They are unable to maintain their staffs. So, they are trying to lay off workers. They cannot settle their borrowings. So, they are trying to sell off their business ventures as the last resort.
We find those people, who grow commercial crops such as rubber and pepper are also experiencing the same predicament. Paddy growers have no support price for their produce. The same situation exists for coconut producers. People are suffering as a result. Their income level has dropped and their expenditure has increased.
I feel that some people, in villages, cant afford to have three meals a day. They have restricted their daily meals. Starving people do not talk about it openly, though. They are silently enduring it. The result of these pent-up emotions was visible at the last elections. Actually, people vented their anger by voting against the Government at the last Local Government Polls conducted on February 10, 2018.

The Government did not live up to public expectations. As a result, we want a change of Government. When people want a new Government, they look to a leader who loves them. There is a leader who is adored by even small kids- that is former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. People are rallying behind him. In fact, more and more people get around him when the Government is harassing him and subjecting him to humiliation on unfair grounds. People live with the hope that the Government would be unseated soon.

The present Government progressing through its term is on its last legs. If we form a Government the people will be disillusioned. They will even lose faith in politicians. We have to be careful
	The SLFP ruined itself. That is what I can say

QHow can it be done as long as Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the United National Party (UNP) are together under the banner of the national Unity Government
We have to see whether SLFPers at the grassroots level desire to form a Government with the UNP. They are really repulsive of the UNP. That is because of harassment by the UNPers at village level. May be, we do not feel it as MPs.  But, our village people feel it. I think it is a wrong decision by the SLFP to team up with the UNP at this hour. We entrusted the SLFP chairmanship in the hands of President Maithripala Sirisena after the presidential elections. Be that as it may, the people gave 105 seats in Parliament to the UNP at the parliamentary elections conducted afterwards in 2015. We should have remained in the opposition allowing the UNP to run the Government. Alongside, we could have supported the Governments initiatives based on merits. If any move by the Government is harmful to the country in our perspective, we can always stand against it. If we had done so, people would not have abandoned the SLFP in this fashion. 

We should have remained in the opposition allowing the UNP to run the Government. Alongside, we could have supported the Governments initiatives based on merits
QIn such an eventuality, the UNP stood the chance of getting a few more MPs from the opposition to form its own Government rather than counting on the SLFP at all. What is your comment
They could have roped in a few more MPs from the SLFP to get the required number to form the Government. Even if it had happened that way, the SLFP, as a party, would not have suffered this fate. The SLFP founder leaders S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike and D.A. Rajapaksa crossed over in Parliament from the ruling party to the opposition in 1950s. They would have harboured much hopes when taking this decision at that time. They realised their ideals after capturing power in 1956. We cannot drift away from their founding ideals as a party today.

QNow the SLFP has been relegated to a distant third position. Instead, a new party called Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) has emerged. As a long standing SLFPer, what do you feel about the SLFP vote base shifting towards the SLPP
The SLFP ruined itself. That is what I can say. We, as the SLFP, took policy decisions on the contrary to public aspirations. The result is the birth of a new party in its place. The SLFP was routed at the Local Government Polls on February 10 as a result. It is now difficult to revive the SLFP. Public anger has built up against the SLFP.
We should stay close to the people and help them realise their aspirations. We should not dictate terms to them by being in Colombo otherwise.

We can do something to stop this country from further sliding into darkness. For it, we can strengthen the hands of the present President
QThere are moves to form an interim Government with the President. What is your view
I interacted with many people at village level recently at events such as funerals. Such a governing arrangement is anathema for our people at village level. In fact, they do not even want to talk about it. They are vehemently opposed to it. Some even threaten to quit us politically if we proceed with our action to form a Government. We have to bear this in mind when taking political decisions. There may be those willing to capture power or to secure posts. What is needed is not that, but to live up to peoples aspirations.
It is difficult for us to get the country out of the current mess merely by capturing Governmental power. The present Government progressing through its term is on its last legs. If we form a Government the people will be disillusioned. They will even lose faith in politicians. We have to be careful.
QPresident Maithripala Sirisena is your long standing friend in politics. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is your brother. There was much antagonism between the two. How feasible is it for them to reconcile differences and unite to form a Government
It is not difficult to bury the resentful past if there is genuine will in the greater interests of the country and its people. It is human nature to forget and forgive. It is not a question. But, what is questionable is whether people will forgive. Our people were harassed. We have to look at things from the peoples point of view.
QIn case an interim Government is formed, will it be able to tide over the current economic and political problems 
It is impossible to find a solution to any of the problems at hand. The country is stricken with terror today. Violence is on the rise. A killing spree has gripped the country. It can be contained by us in power. Nevertheless, nothing substantive can be done on the economic front, though. It is not advisable to be concerned only on capturing power. However, we can do something to stop this country from further sliding into darkness. For it, we can strengthen the hands of the present President.
However, the current Government is committing even worse financial crimes. We read newspaper reports about the Government officials seeking bribes from investors
QIs there any proposal being considered to nominate President Maithripala Sirisena as the next presidential candidate
We hope an eligible candidate will emerge at the right time. It is not a question of nominating the present President or the former President. There could be a novel personage to be considered. It could be a person who is disciplined and has strong decision making capacity.
QIn this case, your brother former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa is mentioned. Also, some MPs such as Vasudeva Nanayakkara propose you as the candidate. What is your view
It is better to have someone more dynamic than I. I am a person who is well- matured in politics and competent enough to see what is right and wrong. I entered politics during my schooldays. I was involved in student politics in 1950s. What happened in 1956 is still vivid in my memory.
QYou served as the Speaker during the former regime. In your view, what are the reasons for the defeat of that Government in 2015
There was a feeling that social decorum declined in the country towards the tail-end of the last Government. Certain individuals who got close to the Governments leadership indulged in some unbecoming activities. There were shortcomings with those appointed to top posts of that Government. It means some people, appointed as heads of Government institutions, had shortcomings. Their employees were disillusioned with the Government as a result.
If not for such disappointments, we could have got the number of votes required to win. These people vented their anger by voting out the Government.

The SLFP ruined itself. That is what I can say. We, as the SLFP, took policy decisions on the contrary to public aspirations
QCan you name such individuals responsible for the defeat
It is not nice for me to name them. Yet, there should have been discussions and people appropriate should have been appointed to the posts concerned. If one is unable to win over the supporters of his employees, there is no use of it.
Some persons became millionaires or billionaires overnight. One cannot keep them away from the public eye. However, the current Government is committing even worse financial crimes. We read newspaper reports about the Government officials seeking bribes from investors.
QThe present President was the General Secretary of the party at that time. He defected from the Government and contested. Do you believe that he had valid reasons to defect
At that time, there was resentment among the Ministers. Bureaucracy sometimes superseded ministers in the decision making process. There was protest against it. When a Ministers independence is compromised and bureaucrats gain the upper hand, there is resentment.
More than that, I believe there was motivation from outside for him to defect from the Government. Some foreign powers might have chosen him and encouraged him to defect.

Plot to harm CBK in 1997 Seeing as to why the landmark FR Judgment on Sirisena Coorays plea was sti
	
The Supreme Court verdict on Sirisena Coorays FR plea became an international sensation two decades ago when Peoples Alliance Government of Chandrika Bandaranaike acted ultra vires. 
The judgment of the SC presided by Dr A. R. B. Amarasinghe, A. S. Wijetunga and Dr Asoka de Z Gunawardena, in the Fundamental Rights case, served as an indictment on the bureaucracy and Police of this country. It was internationally acclaimed as a landmark judgment on freedom and human liberty.
A respected newspaper in India published the decision of our SC with a comment lauding the principles expressed in the judgment. It spoke of the importance of freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and enforced to the letter by the Supreme Court. 
Cooray and Soththi Upali Detained
The Criminal Investigation Departments allegation of a conspiracy to assassinate President Chandrika Bandaranaike was justified by the State to arrest and detain Cooray, a former strongman in the Premadasa regime. 
The mere fact that Arambalage Don Ranjit Upali alias Soththi Upali one of the underworld activists, who was a staunch supporter of Sirisena Cooray during the Premadasa regime had bought a property close to the ancestral home of the President in Attanagalle, was sought after to give credibility to the conspiracy theory. 
State prosecutors attempted to confuse the public and the Judiciary by claiming that there were four confidential reports, which contained highly sensitive information and they would place before the court. 
The contents of these reports like the missing pages of the Bond Commission were said to be highly confidential and could not be made public. But the SC which perused these reports stated that they did not significantly add anything to the affidavit submitted by the Secretary to Ministry of Defence. 

The two regulations, Emergency and Public Security Act gave discretion to the Defence Secretary to issue a detention order
The State argued that the Secretary has absolute powers under the regulations and that the order of the Secretary cannot be questioned. Does he not wield absolute power under it, especially when the accusation is the most serious that could be made against anybody, that he plotted to kill the Executive President.
 
They further argued that the two regulations, Emergency and Public Security Act gave discretion to the Defence Secretary to issue a detention order for the purpose of safeguarding the interest of the nation. 
Revival of Purawesi Peramuna
Cooay, who returned from exile in 1997 was busy planning to commemorate his mentor and assassinated President Ranasinghe Premadasa through a revived Purawesi Peramuna [PP] realizing that the party that was deteriorating after its defeat in 1994 under the leadership of Ranil Wickremesinghe needed to be re-organised and rejuvenated. 
Premadasa backed Dudley to the hilt when the two giants Dudley and JR clashed in the early 1970s which ultimately led to a battle of islands top legal luminaries on the Hulftsdorp hills before they were haulled down to his residence for peace talks by Paris Perera, the former Deputy Speaker.
The unexpected narrowing of differences and patching up disturbed the ambitious man, who had been adding fuel to the hilltop clash from his abode Sucharitha at the base of Hulftsdorp. Ranasinghe Premadasas dream of achieving number two position appeared to be a lost cause when the leader and deputy dropped hostility. The disgruntled man conspired with his loyalists to teach a lesson to his guide and leader, Dudley by organizing an informal group within the Colombos UNP to agitate for party reforms. The Citizens Front gathered momentum as it moved out of the city to the provinces, but was dismantled temporarily after the death of Dudley. 
Attempt to Implicate Sirisena Cooray
He was arrested on unverified information and vague suspicion under an Emergency Order. 
CBKs attempt to implicate Premadasas faithful and loyal friend, Sirisena Cooray in an assassination conspiracy was triggered by Chandrikas suspicion that Sirisena, whose competency, skill and organising capabilities in reviving the party were no secret. Cooray was arrested by a DIG-led Police party on June 16, 1997, and detained for three months in a house at 38 C Keppetipola Mw. Colombo 7.  
Application for Relief for Infringement of Fundamental Rights
A powerful team of lawyers led by K. N. Choksy PC, appeared for the petitioner. The respondents were represented by C. R. de Silva, PC Additional S.G. with Kolitha Dharmawardena DSGS S. Samaranayake, and N. Pulle. 
The petition said: 
The detenue was arrested acting on an order of the Secretary, Ministry of Defence which states: Where the Secretary is satisfied upon the material submitted to him with respect to any person, that with a view to preventing such person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the national security or to the maintenance of public order...It is necessary to do so, the Secretary may make an order that such person is taken into custody for a period not exceeding three months... Respondents cited in the plea were R. K. Chandananda, Secretary to Ministry of Defence, W. B. Rajaguru, IGP and Attorney General. 
In his affidavit to court the Secretary stated by way of justifying his order that he was informed by the Inspector General of Police and other Senior Police Officers that they had received reliable intelligence that the detainee had discussed with others about assassinating the President of Sri Lanka or causing physical harm to her and to create unrest in the country. 
But admitted that he was not informed of the reason for his arrest. 
The Secretary, in his affidavit, stated: 
 I state that T. V. Sumanasekera DIG, CID by a report dated 14.6.97 informed me that he had received reliable information that Mr Cooray had sought the assistance of certain members of a group involved in committing dangerous criminal acts to cause harm to or assassinate HE the President. 
The IGP had informed the Secretary that Soththi Upali was closely connected to Mr Cooray and that Cooray had had negotiations with members of Soththi Upalis gang about assassinating or causing physical harm to the President and creating turmoil in the country. What was the evidence No steps had been taken to check the accuracy of the information. 
Mr. Cooray has categorically denied in his affidavit dated 15th July 1997, that he had any connection with any member of the Soththi Upali group. He also stated that the statement that he was a close associate of Soththi Upali was false and made without a basis. 

JR, Gamini Dissanayake and Cyril Mathew famously employed them; CBK did it through her security chiefs and loyalists; Rajapaksas had a ring in forces and plenty at official level
He explained that he became familiar with Soththi Upali as one of several workers sent to him by President Premadasa to assist him in connection with the Presidential and Parliamentary elections of 1988 and 1989. He said, I have had no dealings with Soththi Upali and have not met or spoken to him since I ceased to be the General Secretary of the United National Party in 1994. Sirisena Cooray had been abroad from June 1996 and returned on the 28th of April 1997. He had read an article published on the front page of Sunday Times of June 22 under Plot against the President. 
Soththi Upali had purchased a plot of land from NHDA under UNP when Cooray was the Minister, prior to 1994; how could that ever have been evidence of a conspiracy to assassinate the President 
Last paragraph of their Lordships verdict 
.Sections 36 and 37 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, therefore, remain applicable to him. Those sections prescribe the procedure established by law that the officer carrying out the Secretarys order should have followed. Section 36 which states: A peace officer making an arrest without a wAarrant shall without unnecessary delay and subject to the provisions contained as to bail take or send the person arrested before a Magistrate having jurisdiction in the case. Section 37 states: Any peace officer shall not detain in custody or otherwise confine a person arrested without a warrant for a longer period than if all the circumstances of the case are reasonable, and such period shall not exceed twenty-four hours exclusive of the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the Magistrate.
Mr, Cooray has been in detention from the 16th of June 1997 without being brought before a magistrate. For the reasons set out in my judgment, I declare that Mr Bulathsinghalage Sirisena Coorays fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 13 (1) and 13 (2) of the Constitution have been violated and that his arrest and detention is unlawful and illegal. I direct the first respondent, the Secretary, Ministry of Defence, to forthwith order the release of the said Mr Bulathsinghelage Sirisena Cooray from custody and detention. The State shall pay the said Mr Bulathsinhalage Sirisena Cooray a sum of Rs. 200,000/- as compensation and costs.
WIJETUNGA, J. - 1 agree
GUNAWARDENA, J. - 1 agree.
Relief granted.

Political clout straightens out the crooked bid!
	
A consignment of goods of a kind produced using artificial raw materials nabbed by authorized officials by thwarting a bid to smuggle it out in three trucks the other day had been summarily released allowing the culprits to go scot-free, they say.

The shipment is said to have been imported by a firm with close ties to a leading political authority.
Soon after the consignment was caught by the authorized ones, the powerful politico had asked the high-ups concerned to quietly release it after levying the normal duty and the latter had readily complied, waiving the normal procedure of holding an inquiry after sealing the shipment.
The high-ups who authorized the release of the shipment had assured their subordinates, who had expressed their concern that an inquiry would be held, but the inquiry is yet to be held though the goods released have already reached the retail outlets, they say.

## Title: Political Parties must have unwavering policies

Political Parties must have unwavering policies
	

The Supreme Court has ruled that certain Articles of the 20th Amendment to the Constitution Bill presented in the Parliament in May by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) as a private members Bill were inconsistent with the Constitution. It has also ruled that if the Bill was to be passed without changing the said Articles it should be passed with two thirds majority in the Parliament and approved by the people at a referendum.
It is amazing to note that many political parties that had been agitating for several decades to abolish the executive Presidency since its introduction in 1978 opposed the 20th Amendmentto the Constitution presented for the very same purpose. In fact, the JVP has exposed the political morality of almost all political parties with its draft Constitutional Amendment. 
Any political party or individual has the right to support or oppose the executive presidential form of governance or any other system as the mode of governance appropriate to Sri Lanka. But if a political party that had in the past supported the notion of abolition of executive presidency had opposed the 20th Amendment to the Constitution just because it was presented by the JVP or because they wanted to see a particular person as the executive president in the near future, it was nothing but political hypocrisy. 
Also if a party or an individual opposes the 20th Amendment after demanding the scrapping of the Presidential form of governance in the past on the grounds that certain Articles of the Amendment are inimical to the national security or national interest that is comprehensible. But if such a party or individual opposed this piece of legislation altogether they ought to give a valid, intellectually sound reason. 
Leaders of many political parties including the main parties have confused their members in particular and the country in general by their irresolute stance on the mode of governance. They have been changing their stance according to the chances of them being at the helm. When they are in Opposition they would oppose the current system of governance but would not if they were in power. 
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) led coalitions had been promising the people before every presidential and Parliamentary election since 1978, the year when the executive Presidency was introduced- that they would scrap this system once they assume power. It is well known that Sirimavo Bandaranaike (in 1988),Chandrika Kumaratunga (in 1994 and 2000) and Mahinda Rajapaksa (in 2005 and 2010) gave this promise to the country. And ridiculously every time they hoodwinked the people, except in 1988 when Mrs. Banadaranaike failed to come to power. Present rulers also came to power mainly on the promise of abolishing the Presidential rule. The main major promise given at the first media conference of Maithripala Sirisena, the common Presidential candidate of the opposition parties on November 21, 2014 was nothing but ridding of this one man rule, as it was called then. 
Loyalists of the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who held the mantle twice promising to scrap the Presidential rule now argue that separatism would be strengthened if the executive presidency was abolished. They put forward this argument nine years after the end of the separatist war whereas they were demanding the abolition of the same system when the separatists were holding a part of the country under their rule. 
The same opportunistic stance is pursued by many political parties in respect of the ethnic issue as well. One would recall that it was under a coalition government led by the SLFP in which Mahinda Rajapaksa and Prof. G. L. Peiris were prominent figures that the federal form of governance was presented several times (in 1995, 1997 and 2000) as the solution to the ethnic problem. And the UNP delegation under the leadership of Prof. Peiris agreed to explore a federal form of solution during the peace talks with the LTTE in 2002. Those people who attempted to implement federalism in the country when the LTTE was a formidable force demonize the same system today. 
We are not promoting or standing for any particular form of governance or a particular solution to the ethnic issue here. The point we are trying to drive home is that political parties must have unwavering policies developed on a scientific basis on major issues that the country faces.

Ranil to meet Modi
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will visit New Delhi later this week and meet his counterpart Narendra Modi to discuss bilateral matters, official sources in Colombo said, the Hindu reported.
Mr. Wickremesinghe, according to his office, will take part in high-level meetings, including with Mr. Modi, on October 19 and 20.
The visit is seen as significant from both sides, sources said. New Delhi has been concerned with the slow pace of several India-aided projects in the island, while Colombo appears inclined to iron out issues, in order to better balance its ties with key partners India and China. President Maithripala Sirisena is scheduled to visit Beijing soon.
From the Indian side, priority projects in the island include the Mattala airport, near the China-controlled port in the southern Hambantota district; the Palaly airport in Jaffna in the Northern Province; the Trincomalee oil tank farm in the east; the East Container Terminal at the Colombo Port and a Liquefied natural gas plant in Kerawalapitiya, north of Colombo. Despite bilateral discussions and joint agreements on development cooperation and commercial partnership, none of the projects have taken off the way it was envisaged. Colombo-based officials, who spoke to The Hindu on condition of anonymity, said the delay was due to political reasons in some cases, and bureaucratic issues in others.
Indias strategic interests in some of these projects, especially in the Mattala airport and Trincomalee oil tank farm, are well known. However, over the last few months, New Delhi and Colombo have put out conflicting messages on the Mattala airport, sparking speculation on whether Indias interest to run it would actually materialise. In principle, India and Sri Lanka have already agreed to jointly operate the world war-era oil storage facility in the strategically advantaged port town of Trincomalee and more recently, the two countries decided that the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and the Lanka IOC PLC (LIOC) would jointly develop the near-85 tanks in the upper farm of the facility. The upcoming discussions, officials on both side said, might help accelerate the projects.
Mr. Wickremesinghes visit to New Delhi comes a little over a month after former President and key Opposition figure Mahinda Rajapaksa met Mr. Modi. The meeting was read by many as a possible thaw in the relationship between the former strongman and New Delhi.

Rupee will hit 200 if S'pore FTA is on: JO
	
The joint opposition (JO) said today the Sri Lanka rupee would hit 200 against the US Dollar by the end of this year if the Singapore FTA, which had enabled thousands of items to be imported without taxes, was still operative.
JO MP Bandula Gunawardana told a news conference that a gazette recently issued in relation to the Singapore FTA had allowed the import of close to 4,000 items without Customs duty.
The President appointed an experts committee to look into the Singapore FTA but the committee is still to release its report. However, it is unknown whether this controversial gazette has been withdrawn, he said.
The MP said the government's efforts at limiting imports to strengthen the rupee was futile as long as the New Trade Policy, which formulates FTAs including the Singapore FTA was still operative and pointed out that the New Trade Policy encouraged imports instead of reducing them.
When this is the policy in writing, there is no point in limiting imports. Policy-based decisions should be taken to prevent excessive imports, he said.
Meanwhile, he rejected government remarks that the local fuel prices had increased due to the increase of crude oil prices in the world market.
This is not true. During the Rajapaksa government, crude oil prices were high and fuel prices were low. Today, the fuel prices are high though the crude oil prices are low. This is a result of depreciation of rupee and high taxes imposed on fuel, he said.(Lahiru Pothmulla)

Saudi Arabia vows  to retaliate after Trump vows severe punishment
	

A combative Saudi Arabia said Sunday it would not bend to threats as it pushed back against growing U.S. and international pressure over allegations it is responsible for the death of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, threatening retaliation for any sanctions. 
Censure of any kind would be met with greater action from Riyadh, it added, pointing out Saudi Arabias vital role in the world economy. 
Trump promised severe punishment would follow if it is found that Saudi Arabia killed Khashoggi. 
Admonitions of the United States emanating from Saudi Arabia bring into question the essential pillars that underpin U.S.-Saudi relations, said Kristin Diwan, a scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. Saudi Arabia has a strategic value to the U.S. that comes from its reliability in managing oil markets and co-ordinating intelligence. If it cant be trusted for this, then all bets are off. 
After the Saudi government statement was released early Sunday, Turki Aldakhil, the general manager of the Saudi-owned al-Arabiya news network, wrote in a column that decision-making circles within the kingdom were considering more than 30 potential measures in response to the threat of sanctions, including pricing oil in Chinese yuan rather than the dollar and allowing Russia to build a military base on Saudi soil. 
But later Sunday, Faisal bin Farhan, a senior adviser to the Saudi Embassy in Washington, wrote on Twitter that the column in no way reflects the thinking of the Saudi leadership.

Trump sending Pompeo to meet with Saudi king
DPA, 15th OCTOBER, 2018- US President Donald Trump said he is immediately dispatching Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Saudi Arabia to meet with King Salman as outcry grows over the disappearance of missing Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
Trump wrote on Twitter that he spoke to King Salman by telephone and that the Saudi ruler denies any knowledge of Khashoggis fate.
Khashoggi, a sharp critic of the kings son, influential Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2 to get paperwork done so that he could marry his Turkish fiancee.
Saudi authorities have rejected widespread claims he was killed inside.
Reports in Turkish media said police would search the consulate on Monday as part of their investigation.
At the weekend Trump threatened severe punishment if it was established that Saudi Arabia murdered Khashoggi, who lived in the US and wrote a column for the Washington Post.

Saudis preparing to admit Jamal Khashoggi died during interrogation
	
The Saudis are preparing a report that will acknowledge that Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi's death was the result of an interrogation that went wrong, one that was intended to lead to his abduction from Turkey, according to two sources.
One source says the report will likely conclude that the operation was carried out without clearance and transparency and that those involved will be held responsible.
One of the sources acknowledged that the report is still being prepared and cautioned that things could change.
The Washington Post columnist was last seen in public when he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in Turkey on October 2. Previously, Saudi authorities had maintained Khashoggi left the consulate the same afternoon of his visit, but provided no evidence to support the claim.
CCTV footage shows Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate on October 2.
Khashoggi's fiance, Hatice Cengiz, who was waiting outside the consulate, says she did not see him re-emerge.
The disappearance created a diplomatic rift between Saudi Arabia and the West. Amid the fallout, international firms pulled out of a high-profile investment summit, the Future Investment Initiative conference, due to take place later this month in Riyadh.
The case also caused friction between Saudi Arabia and Turkey, which repeatedly accused the Saudis of failing to cooperate with their investigation.
Turkish authorities previously said they believed that 15 Saudi men who arrived in Istanbul on October 2 were connected to Khashoggi's disappearance and possible murder. At least some of them appear to have high-level connections in the Saudi government.
On Friday, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN that Turkish authorities have audio and visual evidence that shows journalist Khashoggi was killed inside the consulate.
CNN reporters saw Turkish investigators, including forensics officers, entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul Monday evening. Saudi officials granted permission for the premises to be searched, a Turkish diplomatic source told CNN. Police were seen cordoning off the area before investigators arrived. Turkish officials also wanted to search the nearby consul general's residence.
Earlier Monday, President Donald Trump suggested that "rogue killers" could be behind Khashoggi's disappearance, after a phone call with Saudi Arabia's King Salman about the case. Trump said King Salman told him "in a very firm way that they had no knowledge of it."
Later Monday, Trump said he had seen the latest media reports. But he said he did not know if the report is accurate or just "rumor."
The President said he remains eager to get to the bottom of what happened to Khashoggi. He noted that Turkey and Saudi Arabia are "working together" to determine what happened.
The President said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will "immediately get on a plane" to Saudi Arabia and will likely also go to Turkey "if necessary." On the airplane, State Department Spokesperson Heather Nauert told reporters that Secretary Pompeo "looks forward to meeting with King Salman." (CNN)

STF to be deployed outside prisons from Oct. 20
	
A special unit of the Police Special Task Force (STF) will be deployed outside Sri Lanka's four main prisons from October 20, in a move to prevent drugs and other devices from reaching prison inmates, the Ministry of Justice and Prisons Reforms said yesterday.
Its Senior Assistant Secretary Bandula Jayasinghe said some 300 STF personnel would be deployed for such duties at the Colombo Remand Prison, Magazine Prison, Welikada Prison and the Angunukolapelessa prison.
Mr. Jayasinghe said these measures were being taken to prevent illegal items entering prisons, to enhance security and prevent other illegal activities in prisons. The STF personnel will search individuals and vehicles entering the prison premises.
He said the Prisons Police Intelligence Unit (PPIU) comprising personnel from the Prisons Department would also carry out search operations inside and outside prisons. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

## Title: Sugar imports suspended temporarily

Sugar imports suspended temporarily
	
Sugar Importers' Association yesterday said that they would have to stop importing sugar temporarily, due to world market and Indian market sugar price hike.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror Sugar Importers Association member Priyantha Senavirathne said after imposing an extra control price on sugar imports, an extra loss had to be incurred when importing.
The price of a sugar metric ton in the Indian market was at US$ 340 by yesterday. It costs US$ 400 in the London market and US$ 390 in New York Market, he said.
Accordingly, a sugar importer should have to pay Rs.44.50 tax as customs tax and Rs.58.50 when unloading a kilo of sugar from the Port. Another Rs.3.00 had to be spent on transport and service tax.
When importing a kilo of sugar, importer had to spent Rs.106. When issuing sugar as bulk under the government imposed control price, Rs.92 had to be paid. Rs.100 had to be paid in retail prices. Rs.105 had to be paid when packaging. Extra Rs.14 had to incur as a loss.
When the Government amended the sugar taxes, one ton of sugar in the Indian market was at US$300, but it was US$ 340 by yesterday, Mr Senavirathne said.
The association had to bare a loss of Rs.14 when importing sugar. Therefore, the Association thought to stop importing sugar temporarily. Also, the loss had been increased due to the drastic depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee against the US Dollar.
Mr Senavirathne said the association had requested a discussion with the Finance Ministry today. Also said if the Ministry will take a decision to reduce the customs duty on sugar imports, sugar can be issued under the government control price.
After stopping the sugar imports, there would be a sugar shortage in the country in the upcoming festive season, he said.
The sugar consumption in the country recorded as 40,000 to 50,000 metric tons per month and it would be doubled in the next months due to the festive season. The prevailing stock is only sufficient for a month, he said. (Indika Sri Aravinda)

TV Royal: Making the waves
	

I missed SPARK. Sure, I missed and continue to miss a whole lot of plays, films and other events and this due to the fact that I hardly find the time and what little time I get tends to be spent (or wasted) doing nothing. And yet, SPARK was special. At a time when the government is emphasising on the importance of fostering innovation and creativity, the event, organised by Royal College and held from September 25 to 28, was a veritable exhibition (or an Innovation Expo) showcasing what a typical student (more than 100,000 students from over 500 schools took part), given enough leeway, could do with what he picks up from his studies. It was one of a kind, though not unprecedented, and it was representative of the whole country.
On day three at the college hall, an announcement was made and a website was launched. Both had to do with the inauguration of a TV channel, unconnected to the Expo. Well, SPARK is gone and I am sad to say that I missed it. But that channel, TV Royal, is yet to make the waves. It will be aired on October 26, 27 and 28 (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday) on PEO TV. It will air pre-scripted episodes, live streamed events, even a short film competition. Sure, it has nothing to do with SPARK. But it has everything to do with the spirit of innovation that SPARK stood for.
People have preferences. This is known. And this applies to the media. Television used to be about storytelling, documentaries and creative advertising. Now it is about crass mega series, propaganda pieces and senseless 30-second spots that neither grab attention nor relay a coherent message. And yet, thats what people demand.
Im guessing that most of us want to wade through what little free time we get after school or work with programmes that are easy on the eyes. That is how mega serials have become a huge market. That is how Poya Day serials, so memorable back then, have become so bowdlerised now. Banality is the name of the game here and programmers arent just cautious about treading on new territory, they are terrified. It took years and years for the team behind Koombiyo to get it on the air after all, lets not forget.
TV Royal fulfils two aims. The first, Kaif Sally, one of the two organisers behind the project, told me, is selfish. There are at present 48 clubs and societies extending to almost every field of activity, from astronomy to zoology, at Royal. As Kaif put it, they are drawn to the competition that results from the pressure of proving that your club is better than your friends. For this reason, TV Royal will attempt to bring out the sense of kinship between them.
The second aim, which I am interested in, is selfless and it entails setting a trend for other schools to follow. To put it more succinctly, this is the first time that a school here will telecast its own channel. We do not want to set a precedent and then prevent others from matching that precedent. We want them to equal us, do better than us and along the way, reinvigorate the concept of media units in the country, Kaif told me.
The problem, as he points out, is that there is a serious dearth of such media units in Sri Lanka. The way I see it, this is buttressed by the lack of three things: equipment, interest among the students and a set of media competitions.
It is not that schools, even those outside Colombo, lack willpower. Just three months ago, for instance, St. Annes College, Kurunegala organised Sanvidha Sanjani (which I missed, though for reasons of health), which delved into several facets of the media, from broadcasting to scriptwriting. But such events are more the exception than the norm (Sanvidha was held after a long time) and they depend, for the most, on the interest of a student or a group of students. That is the issue TV Royal is trying to resolve, just as SPARK tried to resolve (in its own special way) the virtual absence of a culture of innovation in our students. To this end, a brief note on the organisers, the episodes and the objective that the project is set to achieve, is called for.
TV Royal is the brainchild of one institution, MURC. Thats the Media Unit of Royal College. It is unique, not only because of the resources it and the school it is affiliated to are endowed with, but also because it has managed to step out to. Established in 2001, it traces its beginnings to the late 1990s, when the Sinhala Literary Association went beyond its comfort zone and set up an unofficial media unit that facilitated news broadcasts. We were limited in what we did when we started out. It was all about announcing. After 2007, we moved. We embraced photography, videography, graphic designing and live streaming. All these boil down to four outfits: the News Team, the Video Crew, MURC Creatives (covering everything from photography to event management), and Le Postre (something of a talent agency that enables students to take their creativity beyond the school).

Today, MURC is everything a media company can be. It organises workshops every year and practically every month, to select and groom students who wish to engage in the media. Be it graphic designing or photography or even announcing, the process is the same: the senior selects the students who then become his understudies. This system, despite its share of flaws, works. It works because, as Kaif tells me, seniors are shrewd enough to pick students who exhibit merit. It is this intricate relationship, between seniors and juniors, that found its way to TV Royal: mooted in 2014 by the MURC board, it became the idea of the year four years later, THIS year, for Kaif and the other main organiser, Abdul Rizvie.
In essence, the project, budgeted at five million rupees, will involve 10 directors, 22 managers (that is, the chairmen of the clubs and societies), and around 40 or 50 crew members. As Abdul puts it, it is easier to think of a television line-up than to actually plan one, which is probably why, even with the involvement of so many young professionals, there have been edits, cuts and inordinate delays.
TV Royal will highlight these bodies. There is the Scouts Association, the Western Orchestra, the Oriental Music Society, the Red Cross Society and the Library Readers Association. These are not the only clubs, but with what little time I had, I only managed to talk with their chairmen, to know what they have planned out.
The scouts will feature a hike across Mandaram Nuwara. The orchestra will feature some western classical pieces and English songs and a recounting of their history. The Oriental Music Society will feature some old Sinhala songs (from Sanda Hiru Tharu to Mage Punchi Rosa Male) and a reading of their lyrics. The Red Cross Society, with the Sri Lanka Wildlife Conservation Project, will feature the elephant-human conflict and one innovative way through which it can be resolved (a hint: pani dodam). The Library Readers Association will feature a certain writer and a montage of clips on the world of literature. These clubs and projects are in-house, but at the same time, they are about things that exist outside their walls, their perimeters.

TV Royal is the brainchild of one institution, MURC. Thats the Media Unit of Royal College. It is unique, not only because of the resources it and the school it is affiliated to are endowed with, but also because it has managed to step out to
Sahan Kithmina, Chairman of the Readers Association, summed up for me what he wanted to do with his society: Api ramuwen eliyata yanna oni. In other words, get out of the frame. The same can be said of the projects, going beyond the four walls of an institution that other clubs will indulge in. Im guessing it will be easy on the eyes. But Im also guessing it will offer a veritable alternative to what television, so long in the hands of crass commercialists and profiteers, have offered or ever will offer. So no, I wont miss it. Not for the world.

## Title: Zero Hunger:  Our actions today are our future tomorrow

Zero Hunger:  Our actions today are our future tomorrow
	

Global economic impact of obesity at USD 2 trillion p.a.
	Last year, 1.5bn people suffered from micronutrient deficiencies
	Childhood overweight affected 38mn children in 2017
	Obesity rates climbing fast in Africa
Just three years ago, in September 2015, all United Nations member States approved the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The eradication of hunger and all forms of malnutrition (Sustainable Development Goal No.2) was defined by world leaders as a cardinal objective of the Agenda, a sine qua non condition for a safer, fairer and more peaceful world.
Paradoxically, global hunger has only grown since then. According to the latest estimates, the number of undernourished people in the world increased in 2017, for the third consecutive year. Last year, 821 million people suffered from hunger (11 per cent of the world population - one in nine people on the planet), most of them family and subsistence farmers living in poor rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia.
However, the growing rate of undernourished people is not the only big challenge we are facing. Other forms of malnutrition have also increased. In 2017, at least 1.5 billion people suffered from micronutrient deficiencies that undermine their health and lives, at the same time, the proportion of adult obesity continues to rise, from 11.7 per cent in 2012 to 13.3 per cent in 2016 (or 672.3 million people).
Hunger is mainly circumscribed to specific areas, namely those ravaged by conflicts, droughts and abject poverty; yet obesity is everywhere, and it is increasing all around the world. As a matter of fact, we are witnessing the globalisation of obesity. For instance, obesity rates are climbing faster in Africa than in any other region  eight of the 20 countries in the world with the fastest rising rates of adult obesity are in Africa. Furthermore, childhood overweight affected 38 million children under five years of age in 2017. About 46 per cent of these children live in Asia, while 25 per cent live in Africa.
If we do not call for urgent action to halt the increasing obesity rates, we soon may have more obese than undernourished people in the world. The growing rate of obesity is happening at a huge socio-economic cost. Obesity is a risk factor for many non-communicable diseases such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and some types of cancer. Estimates indicate that the global economic impact of obesity is about USD 2 trillion per year (2.8 per cent of the global GDP). This is equivalent to the impacts of smoking or armed conflicts.
This year, the World Food Day (celebrated every October 16) aims to remind the international community of its fundamental political commitment to humanity -- the eradication of all forms of malnutrition -- and raise awareness that achieving a Zero Hunger world by 2030 (so in 12 years time) is still possible. The experience of Brazil is a good example to have in mind.
According to FAO estimates, hunger in Brazil was reduced from 10.6 per cent of the total population (about 19 million people) at the beginning of the 2000s to less than 2.5 per cent in the 2008-2010 triennium, which is the minimum value in which FAO can make meaningful statistical inference. This reduction in the number of undernourished people was mainly possible due to the firm commitment of former President Lula and the implementation of public policies and social protection programmes addressing extreme poverty and the impacts of prolonged droughts in the northeastern part of the country.
In fact, governments have the most fundamental role in achieving Zero Hunger by ensuring vulnerable people have sufficient income to buy the food they need, or the means to produce it for themselves -- even in times of conflict.
However, world leaders have to bear in mind that the concept of Zero Hunger is broader and not limited to the fight against undernourishment. It aims to provide people with the necessary nutrients for a healthy life. Zero Hunger encompasses the eradication of all forms of malnutrition. So it is not just about feeding people but nourishing people as well.

World leaders have to bear in mind that the concept of Zero Hunger is broader and not limited to the fight against undernourishment
Current global food systems have increased the availability and accessibility of processed food that is very caloric and energy-dense, high in fat, sugar and salt. Food systems must be transformed in a way so that all people can consume healthy and nutritious food. We need to address obesity as a public issue, not as an individual problem. This requires the adoption of a multi-sectoral approach involving not only governments, but also international organisations, national institutions, civil society organisations, the private sector and citizens in general.
It must be a collective effort towards healthy diets that include, for instance, the creation of norms such as labelling and banning of some harmful ingredients, the introduction of nutrition in the school curriculum, the adoption of methods to avoid food loss and waste, and the establishment of trade agreements that do not hamper access to locally-grown, fresh and nutritious food from family farming.
Our actions are our future is the message of World Food Day 2018. It is time to renew our commitment and, even more important, the political support towards a sustainable world free from hunger and all forms of malnutrition.
