SL border stone kept in Adams bridge area
	
Rameswaram: A border stone with the words 'Sri Lanka' inscribed on it and with the Island-government's official emblem on top has been found to have been installed on the seventh of the chain of limestone shoals (islets) in the 'Adams Bridge' area in the shallow seas off Dhansuhkodi, to apparently indicate Sri Lanka's maritime border with India.
'Adams Bridge' or 'Ram Sethu (bridge over the sea)' as found mentioned in the Indian epic 'Ramayana', comprises a chain of limestone shoals surrounded by shallow sea, that was once believed to have interlinked Rameswaram Island in India with Mannar off the northwestern coast of Sri Lanka, it may be recalled. The 30-km long bridge-like structure- whether it was man-made or natural formation is still a point of debate-, separates the Gulf of Mannar from the Palk Strait in the Bay of Bengal near here.
Tamil Nadu fishermen often run into trouble in the ocean waters close to Katchatheevu islet, with the Sri Lankan Navy charging the former with poaching into their territorial waters as the maritime boundary line cannot be clearly demarcated in full.
While India has installed its territorial sign board on the fifth of these chain of islets comprising 'Adams Bridge' off Dhanushkodi, some fishermen of Rameswaram who put out to sea on Friday have now, reportedly for the first time, found that Sri Lanka has put up its border stone on the seventh islet. They returned home and reported the matter to the authorities here, according to M Murugesan, a fisherman who was part of the group who noticed it.(Deccan Chronicle)

UNP will now focus on party reorganization: Ranil
	
The United National Party (UNP) will go ahead with the reorganization tasks of the party which was planned last December, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said during the weekend.
The party planned a reorganization drive earlier during the year with the appointment of three deputy leaders but postponed it.
"It was I who suggested that the reorganization should be postponed till the May Day was over. However we can go-ahead with it now. The time has come to think of younger members of our party," he told party activists in the Badulla District on Saturday.
He said the party's plan in 2015 was not only to capture the central government alone but to capture the provincial councils and local bodies as well. "Let us try and capture the provincial councils and the local bodies now as elections are going to be held soon," he said.(Yohan Perera, Palitha Ariyawansa and Prasad Rukmal)
