Amana Bank opens first self-banking centre at Slave Island
	
Amana Bank inaugurated its first self-banking centre at Slave Island under the patronage of Chief Executive Officer Mohamed Azmeer alongside the banks Director Jazri Magdon Ismail and members of the management committee.
The self-banking centre, which is one of many to be launched, currently houses a Cash Deposit Machine and a Cheque Deposit Box to facilitate 24x7 transactions for customers.
Commenting on the banks initiative to introduce self-banking centres, Chief Executive Officer Mohamed Azmeer stated: While customers have 24x7 access to over 4000 ATMs through the LankaPay network for withdrawals, their access to deposits was limited to only standard banking hours at our branches. With the introduction of our self-banking centre, customers now have the convenience of making deposits round the clock. We intend to expand this initiative to many more regions, thereby providing greater reach and access to our valued customers.
The Slave Island self-banking centre is centrally located at No.113, Justice Akbar Mawatha,Colombo 02.

CDB wins big at Best Corporate Citizen Sustainability Awards
	
Citizens Development Business Finance PLC (CDB) was rewarded by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC) when it was crowned First Runner Up in the Turnover Less Than Rs.15 billion category, Best Sustainability Project for the Green Ninja Project, and accorded a Merit Certificate for its Act Early for Autism Awareness project.
CDBs unwavering commitment to best practices in sustainability has been continuously recognised at the Best Corporate Citizen Sustainability Awards. The company attained first runner up in the same category for two years consecutively, both this year and previously in 2016 as well, while winning the coveted top award in the Turnover Less Than Rs. 15 Bn Category in 2015, when it was also named one of the Ten Best Corporate Citizens.
For CDB Deputy CEO/CFO Damith Tennakoon, these wins are a route to further strengthening CDBs unique brand of sustainability, where he urges his team to walk the talk. To be placed among the countrys topmost corporate citizens by an august entity like the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce repeatedly, surely underlines that CDBs thought process and action plan on sustainability is a business imperative. The success we have garnered over 20 years, despite intense challenges, has seen us take our place among the top seven NBFIs in the country, which while being no mean feat, also emphasises that the nucleus upon which our business model is built is a strong and holistic sustainability ethos that thrives on a stakeholder mindset.
The Green Ninja CDB Quiz Master 2017 initiative that won the Best Sustainability Project Award further highlights CDBs unrelenting focus on its sustainability fundamentals - quality of life that must be sustained and grown through green practices that assure a healthy planet, sharing knowledge, encouraging leadership and enabling growth of individuals, communities and the nation. The companys green commitment is well evidenced with it being the first ISO 14064-1 carbon verified financial institution in South Asia accredited by the Sri Lanka Carbon Fund, which drove it to moot a pioneering mindset, one result of which is seen in the Green Ninja initiative organised by the G Squared=Go Green Club.
This unique quiz which cascaded the green message to the members across all CDB branches held the quiz over three rounds including the Grand Finale with over 100 participants representing 80 percent of the network, with the winners being presented eco-friendly trophies in keeping with best green practices. The levels of knowledge were considered extremely high as the various teams answered a multitude of questions on five themes based on water, waste management, energy, biodiversity and climate change which included those given by the Business Bio Diversity Platform Sri Lanka. Our aim was to spread the environmental message throughout our operational network, explains Tennakoon. By making each individual responsible for their actions, inbuild conservation and infuse a greener culture aligned to CDBs sustainability agenda, we gave these young men and women the power to raise their green voice.
Act Early for Autism, the Autism Awareness Project launched by CDB in 2016 and which heralded a Merit Certificate deserves worthy mention due to the company publicising an issue that for the most remains unspoken of, unattended or simply ignored. To celebrate its 20th anniversary, in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Association for Child Development, CDB invested in a three phase project that included the setting up of an Autism Trust Fund, a mass media campaign, a hotline at the CDB Customer Care Center and disseminated information through Tri-lingual poster campaigns via mobile clinics and outreach programmes conducted at rural hospitals across the country. The company will augment the fund further by bringing in the customers into the equation, where for each contribution of one million Rupees (business secured) disbursed and deposits mobilised Rs.100 will be added to the fund.

## Title: Changing your diet to one that works

Changing your diet to one that works
	

Dietary trends are increasingly becoming popular. More people resort to vegetarian and vegan diets in the pursuit of a healthy lifestyle. Nutritionist of the Nutrition Society, Sri Lanka Roshan Delabandara, explained to Health Capsule readers about vegan and vegetarian diets, its benefits and challenges. 
Both vegans and vegetarians follow plant based diets, but do not consume animal meat. A plant based diet would include fruits, vegetables, legumes, cereals, pulses, nuts, etc. 
It is a common misconception among people that vegan and vegetarian is the same. This is not so. Vegans consume a diet solely based on plant sources. They do not eat any animal based food products. This means that vegans will not consume eggs, milk and other dairy products including butter, cheese and yoghurt, Delabandara explained. He further added that vegans also avoid other animal derived foods such as honey and gelatine. In short being a vegan means avoiding all foods that are products and by-products of animals.
While vegetarians also follow plant based diets, they may selectively include certain animal derived foods such as eggs, milk and other dairy products in their diets. 

Types of Vegetarians 
Unlike vegans, vegetarians may include foods derived from animals excluding meat. Based on their food patterns, vegetarians are classified to groups. The common classification includes Lacto-ovo vegetarians, lacto vegetarians and ovo vegetarians. Additionally there are certain groups called pollotarians, pescatarians and flexatarians. 
Lacto-ovo vegetarians, lacto vegetarians and ovo vegetarians do not eat red meat (beef, pork, mutton, etc), fish, sea food or poultry (chicken, duck, turkey, etc). Their meals are plant based. However, lacto ovo vegetarians include both dairy products as well as eggs in their diet. Most vegetarians fall under this category. Lacto vegetarians include dairy products in their diet, but they avoid eggs. Ovo vegetarians include eggs in their diet, but they avoid dairy products, the nutritionist stressed. 
There are certain types of food diets that cannot be considered entirely vegetarian so they are referred to as semi vegetarian diets. Pollotarians and pescatarians follow semi vegetarian diets. A pollotarian consumes poultry in addition to a plant based diet. But they do not consume red meat, fish or sea food. A pescatarian consumes fish and seafood in addition to a plant based diet, but will not consume red meat or poultry. Flexatarians consume plant based diets, but they occasionally consume meat. They arent considered as vegetarians, he mentioned. 

Benefits of veggie diets 
The nutritionist explicated that plant based diets provide good nutrition to the body. Vegetarian diets contribute to lowering the tendencies for non-communicable diseases like diabetes. These diets are devoid of animal fats. So vegetarians and vegans are less likely to suffer from high cholesterol. This reduces the risks of strokes and heart diseases. Vegetarian diets also contribute to reducing obesity. Fruits and vegetables are especially rich in fibre. Fibre contributes to a healthy digestive systems and regulates bowel movements. Vegetarian diets help reduce risks of cancers.

Dietary challenges 
When you follow vegetarian diets, meeting certain requirements regarding specific nutrients can become a problem. Your body will face the challenge of receiving adequate protein, vitamins and minerals.
Proteins are classified as high quality and low quality proteins. High quality proteins are proteins where most of it is absorbed into the body. Low quality proteins are those where most may not be absorbed into the body. Most high quality proteins are found in animal sources such as meat, fish, eggs and milk. Eggs have the largest amounts of high quality proteins. Proteins are made up of building blocks known as amino acids. The body receives 9 essential amino acids from food. These too are received mainly from animal products such as meat, eggs, milk. We may only receive 1 or 2 essential amino acids from plant sources, explained Delabandara. 
He further stated that receiving adequate amounts of Vitamin B 12 is another vegetarian issue. Natural microbes in the gut of humans produce B 12. This is one source that vegans and vegetarians get their vitamin B12 from in addition to certain cereals and plant foods. But the use of antibiotics when sick can destroy gut bacteria causing a reduction in vitamin B 12. Vitamin B 12 is available in eggs and dairy products like milk and yoghurt. So it will be a challenge for vegans and vegetarians who dont consume dairy products. 
Minerals such as calcium, iron and zinc requirements are also hard to find in ones diet. Iron is classified into two types; namely haem and non-haem. Haem iron is absorbed well into the body and they are mostly present in animal sources. Non-haem iron is only absorbed in the presence of haem iron. This is why when preparing Gotu kola (Centella asiatica), Maldivian fish and lime are added. The non-haem iron in the plant will be absorbed due to the presence of the haem iron in the Maldivian fish. Lime enhances the absorption of iron, he accentuated. 
According to the nutritionist, the solution to facing the vegetarian challenges is by including variety in your vegetarian diet. Including a variety of different pulses and cereals such as gram, green gram, dhal, etc along with many vegetables and fruits daily is important. It can be clearly understood that vegans find the dietary challenge more demanding as their food choices are limited to plant sources. However vegetarians who consume eggs and dairy will find it easier to fulfill their nutrition requirements. 

Approaching a healthier diet 
Between a vegan and vegetarian diet, which is the better one It depends on the person. This is a matter of choice. The choice of becoming a vegan is not easy and requires extra effort. It is challenging, but not impossible. A vegetarian diet would allow you to fulfill your nutrient requirements all the while allowing you to remain free of consuming meats. If you are thinking of approaching a veggie diet from a non-vegetarian one, being a vegetarian is the best way to start rather than becoming a vegan. The shifting of the mode of food patterns is not easy all at once. It is better to approach the vegetarian diet step by step. First you can give up red meat, then chicken, then fish. Take it step by step. This will make the transition to a vegetarian diet easier and successful, advised the nutritionist.

Countrys vote not against any UN member state: SL
	
The Sri Lankan Government today said the countrys vote in favour of the UN resolution on Jerusalemwas not a vote against any member State of the United Nations.
Issuing a statement, the Foreign Affairs Ministry said Sri Lankavoted in favour of the resolution titled Status of Jerusalem submitted by Yemen and Turkey at the tenth emergency special session of the UN General Assembly on December 21.
Thevote in favour of the resolution was on the basis of Sri Lankas long held traditional and principled position, which is in keeping with the international understanding that Jerusalem is a final-status issue that must be resolved through negotiations between the two parties on the basis of the relevant UN resolutions, taking into account the legitimate concerns of both partiesPalestinians and Israelis and that Jerusalem should be the shared capital of the Israeli and Palestinian States, it said.
The Ministry said the resolution reaffirms Sri Lankasposition and the countrysvote in favour of the resolution was not a vote against any member State of the United Nations.
Sri Lanka stands by its position that it is only by realizing the vision of two States living side-by-side in peace, security and mutual recognition, with Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and Palestine, with all matters resolved permanently through negotiations, that the legitimate aspirations of both parties and sustainable peace can be achieved.
Therefore, Sri Lanka strongly believes that all parties concerned should work with restraint, and focus on creating conditions for direct and meaningful negotiations that can resolve all final status issues required for a negotiated settlement, the ministry said.

## Title: Eating away at your digestive system

Eating away at your digestive system
	

Since recent times the stomach bug has plagued many people. Patients experience great discomfort when the stomach bug bites them. Although it seems like a simple disease, if not treated properly and immediately there can be dire complications. Speaking to the Health Capsule, Dr. Deepal Perera, Consultant Paediatrician, Apeksha Hospital, Maharagama said, Its known as gastroenteritis. It may be acute or be chronic. He further explained that one of the most important things that should be done is to give the patient adequate fluid as he/she loses fluids through diarrhea and vomiting. The doctor warned that given such a condition a patient can go into shock and even die from dehydration. 


Identification
Speaking of the symptoms that are often present, the doctor said, Symptoms include, fever, vomiting, nauseated feelings, abdominal pain, feeling uncomfortable, loose stools. Loose stools may be watery or it may be with blood or with or without mucus. 

How it occurs
Dr. Perera further said that there are several causes for this condition. One is viral. The main virus we know of is rotavirus. The others are bacterial. Mainly Rovella, Shigella, Ecolii and Campylobacter. Although we dont see it there is also amoeba. Bacteria, viral and even fungal infections can cause the stomach bug. If it is bloody diarrhea there are certain causes for this. Some bacteria such as Salmonella, Shigella, E. coli can cause blood and mucus in diarrhea. Amoeba can sometimes be the cause, but we dont see it now. If it is viral, such as Rotavirus, it is infectious and can infect other family members and even spread to a class or a Montessori and affect other students, said Dr. Perera. He explained that this illness can spread through food and water or when people dont wash their hands properly after using the washroom. 

Complications
The doctor further explained that there are many complications that can occur, such as, dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, septicaemia etc. There are complications. The main complication is dehydration. With dehydration the patient can go into shock and even collapse and die. The cause for this can be either viral or bacterial. Bacteria can cause Septicaemia, which is blood poisoning. The bacteria can spread through the blood all over the body and again cause shock. Another complication that can occur is Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome which damages the kidneys. This could cause low urine output. Dehydration also causes low urine output. Further complications include Hematuria which is blood in urine. Diarrhea can cause an electrolyte imbalance, that is low sodium, low potassium, low calcium. Low potassium could cause abdominal distension. Further, what we call paralytic ileus can also happen. This is when the bowel is not working properly. In such situations if you feed the child, it will vomit and you will get more abdominal distention. Furthermore, patients with diarrhea can go into fits because of the low blood sugar and low sodium. explained Dr. Perera 

Treatment
Speaking of the treatment Dr. Perera explained how different symptoms are treated. The most important thing is hydration. For any stomach bug or loose stools we should provide the oral rehydration solution or what is more commonly known here as Jeevani. Giving natural fluids too is very important. Natural fluids that patients should have include, king coconut water, congee water, lime juice, lemon juice, promegranate, bananas or even toast. Bananas and honey are very good for people suffering from the stomach bug. However, green leaves, papaya, oils, butter should not be given to patients who are suffering from loose stools. Giving adequate fluids is one of the most important steps in treatment,the doctor said. 
If there is vomiting we cant give oral fluids, so the vomiting too has to be treated. Vomiting can be stopped by giving either tablets, syrups or IV drugs. This is to make sure that you have adequate fluids. Sometimes when giving oral fluids while vomiting is present, we should make sure to continue with IV fluids overnight or for the next 24 hours. We dont give anti-diarrheal drugs to children. The diarrhea needs to pass and the stomach has to settle. If the patients stomach is really hurting or there is gastritis, antacids can be given, he continued. 
Speaking of treating bacterial infections he said, Only when it is necessary should antibiotics be given. If we suspect bacterial action, such as when blood and mucus are seen in the stools, we may give antibiotics. Furthermore, a stools culture report can be obtained in order to find out the organism and later treat it. If it is typhoid or bacillus dysentery, where there is the presence of blood and mucus diarrhea, we should notify necessary officials. The one thing that I have noticed in the last few months and even in the last few years, is that some children who obtain water from wells in the Colombo District and the suburbs, develop typhoid fever. To avoid this, chlorine needs to be added to the well water. Otherwise, it is not like water from the water board. Sometimes it can be contaminated with e colii, the bacteria which is present in stools,he said. Moreover Dr. Perera explained,Apart from antibiotics and probiotics prebiotics can be used when treating loose stools. These are good for patients who have diarrhea. Further, it was recently found that Zinc, the element, is good for diarrhea, in order to shorten the duration of this illness. 

Prevention
Dr. Perera further explained that prevention is very important. There is a vaccine available now for Rota virus. There is also a vaccine available for typhoid. For the rest we should take proper precautions. Washing ones hands is very important, especially with soap and water. Personal hygiene is vital to avoid such illnesses. People should wash their hands properly before meals, after using the washroom and before preparing meals. Furthermore, you must be careful of the food that you eat. The food should be protected from flies and all these bugs. Moreover, the food should be well cooked and properly boiled . Even the water you drink should be boiled and cooled. he explained.


A comparison
Dr. Perera further explained that food poisoning and the stomach bug are different. Food poisoning occurs also due to certain organisms, but not particularly the organisms that I mentioned. Sometimes Staphylococcus or certain other rare organisms can cause it. People who eat from the same canteen can develop stomach pain, vomiting and loose stools. This is because of food poisoning. The majority of cases is present because of the bacteria coming from cooks and chefs. However the stomach bug and food poisoning are not the same thing. The stomach bug is rare and can be seen in one or two patients. However, in food poisoning, all or most of the people who eat from the same place are affected by it. But loose stools concerning the stomach bug only affect a few people, he concluded.

Emission Tests useless, says racer Dilantha
	
There is no standard on tests performed on vehicle emission for motor vehicles when obtaining the certification for the annual renewal of vehicle revenue licence, Sri Lankan racing driver Dilantha Malagamuwa said.
He also said that the Government should relax the tax on electric vehicles so as to reduce pollution instead of focusing on emission tests.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror he said due to huge traffic congestion billions of litres of fuel is burnt by idling engines.
Im totally against on Vehicle Emission Testing (VET) and it should be withdrawn because nothing towards the betterment of the environment takes place. The progress of the VET can be seen when we look at the roads, he said.
The Government had made the VET compulsory for the renewals of annual revenue licences only to increase Government revenue, but it had not helped reduce environmental pollution, he said.
80 percent of the vehicles fail the VET. More vehicles should be taken out from the road as they are unfit and polluting. But so far no vehicles had been removed from the road for failing VET, Mr. Malagamuwa said.
Therefore, the Government should take measures to relax the huge tax, is which imposed on electric vehicles, when importing them and should take measures to promote them even-though the Government incurred a loss, he said.
Also the Government should take measures to operate a mobile service to detect vehicles with high emission and to take legal actions against them.
The fine on traffic offences and the road rules and regulations should be increased, also the Government should take actions for vehicle drivers tooting indecently, Mr. Malagamuwa said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Fitch upgrades DFCC Banks rating outlook from Negative to Stable
	

Fitch Ratings have revised DFCCs outlook for both its International and National Long Term Ratings to Stable from Negative while affirming the ratings at B+ and AA- respectively.
The rating agency said that this outlook revision reflects their view that adverse effects on the banks credit profile from increasing risks in the domestic operating environment previously expected have reduced.
DFCCs Viability Rating and the National Long-Term Rating capture its developing commercial banking franchise and still-high capitalisation levels relative to the peers.
DFCCs Sri Lanka Rupee-denominated senior debt is rated at the same level as its National Long-Term Rating, as the debentures rank equally with other senior unsecured obligations.
The banks subordinated debt rating will move in tandem with the banks National Long-Term Rating.
Commenting on the latest rating review, DFCC Bank CEO Lakshman Silva said: This upgrade in DFCCs rating outlook by Fitch closely follows a similar upgrade by S&P Global Ratings which clearly indicates that the rating agencies have recognised DFCCs effort to keep the fundamentals strong. The positivity reflected by the upgrade of our outlook by both rating agencies gives us confidence to drive the bank to create more value for its stakeholders and press on with our plans for long term growth and stability.

Food security in Middle East, North Africa deteriorating: UN
	

REUTERS, 21st DECEMBER, 2017-
Food security in the Middle East and North Africa is quickly deteriorating because of conflict in several countries in the region, the United Nations said on Thursday.
In those hardest hit by crises -- Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Libya and Sudan -- an average of more than a quarter of the population was undernourished, the U.N.s Food and Agriculture Organization said in its annual report on food security.
A quarter of Yemens people are on the brink of famine, several years into a proxy war between the Iran-aligned Houthis and the Saudi-backed government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi that has caused one of the worst humanitarian catastrophes in recent times.
The report focused on changes to food security and nutrition across the region since 2000.
It said that undernourishment in countries not directly affected by conflict, such as most Gulf Arab states and most North African countries including Egypt, had slowly improved in the last decade. But it had worsened in conflict-hit countries.
The costs of conflict can be seen in the measurements of food insecurity and malnutrition, the FAOs assistant director-general Abdessalam Ould Ahmed said.

Gems for healing and good luck
	

From the dawn of the human civilization. gems and other precious stones have been in high demand. From the ancient times, royalty and nobility had taken great pride and pleasure in wearing ornaments studded with precious stones. And over the ages, making of ornaments bedecked with gems and other precious stones has developed into a fine art.

Gemstones for more important purposes
Sages from the age of theVedas and Puranas had discovered that the gemstones could serve more useful purposes for the humanity than as jewels for adornment. In fact, the great Indian sage Varahamihira who lived in the 1st century BC has devoted a full chapter to gems and precious stones in his monumental work Brihat Samhita. Another Sanskrit work, Ratnapariksha written by Buddhatatta in the 6th century BC dwells at length on the virtues of precious stones and gems and what they symbolize. The ancients had discovered through studies and experiments that different gemstones, create, among other things, varied distinctive reactions on the human body. In fact, the discovery that gems and other precious stones could be used to ward off evil planetary effects added a new dimension to the science of Astrology.

Precious stones to heal and usher in fortune
In fact, the ancients had discovered that the precious stones could be used not only to avert malefic planetary influences, but also to heal the sick and to bring fortune and prosperity.

Rationale for use of gemstones
The rationale for the use of precious stones as a medium for warding off malefic influences, providing relief from physical ailments, and ushering in fortune and happiness is based on their extra sensitivity to rays emanated by planets. There is a distinct nature or a quality of rays that each planet gives forth. These rays carry certain colours and vibrations which may or may not be in harmony with the body chemistry of a particular individual. Colours and vibrations from planets which are not in harmony with the body chemistry of an individual may bring him disease and misfortune. The ancients have ascribed a particular gem or a precious stone to each planet in accord with the colour of the rays it emanates.

Electro-magnetic field around human body
We all know that Suns rays are made up of seven colours, violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and red. These colours produce different vibrations. The gemstone ascribed to the Sun would regulate their cumulative effect on the human body to produce a favourable impact on the individual.
Every human being has an electromagnetic field around him and the Suns rays first interact with this field.
Therefore, the use of different gems and precious stones in Astrology is based on the colour and vibration effects made on the human body by the rays of different planets. Gems and precious stones possess both preventive and curative qualities. Therefore, when using gems and precious stones for the cure and prevention of diseases one should know the parts of the human body controlled by the planets and the signs of the Zodiac involved.

Getting a new lease of life
	

Kidney transplantation is the optimum treatment for end-stage kidney failure. Although the preparation and progress to a kidney transplant involves a complex series of events, the end result is a normal functioning kidney and a new lease of life. 

What they do
Kidneys are essential for life. Humans usually have two kidneys placed in the retroperitoneum (behind the intestines) which are involved in numerous essential functions which include: 
clearance of toxins from the body via urine 
	maintaining water balance 
	contributing to the control of
blood pressure 
production of certain hormones etc. 
What causes kidneys to fail
There are two types of kidney failure; acute (sudden and often reversible) and chronic (long-standing and often irreversible). 

Acute kidney failure is often caused by conditions such as infections, use of toxic drugs and severe dehydration. It starts suddenly and progresses rapidly. However, with early identification and proper treatment, this condition is often completely reversible. Chronic kidney failure has a slower progression often causing gradual deterioration of the kidneys over several years. The commonest reasons for chronic kidney
failure are: 


diabetes 
	hypertension 
	kidney stones and repeated infections 
	long-term use of toxic medications 
	immunological diseases (where the body starts producing antibodies that harm ones own kidneys) etc. 
What is end-stage kidney failure
Chronic kidney failure progresses slowly. In the initial stages, it can be controlled with medication. End-stage kidney failure is when chronic kidney failure has progressed to the extreme to cause complete kidney failure where medical treatment is inadequate. 

End-stage kidney failure requires renal replacement therapy. Renal replacement therapy is where the functions of the kidneys are performed artificially by way of dialysis or transplantation of a new kidney. 

Renal transplantation is the best long-term treatment for end-stage kidney failure which gives the longest chance of survival and best quality of life. 


Transplant
Donor kidneys can be from live donors or deceased (dead) donors. Live donor kidneys give the best outcomes by way of long term survival. Donating a single kidney is perfectly safe for a healthy person. However, live donors are not always easy to find. The alternative is a deceased donor. These are patients who suffer from brain death in hospitals following accidents, strokes etc. 



How to select a suitable kidney
The first thing is to make sure that the potential donor is compatible with the recipient. There are two types of compatibility tests carried out in hospital. 
The first basic compatibility is for the
blood group. 

The second stage of compatibility testing is for tissue antigens called Human Leucocyte Antigens (HLA) and crossmatch. The HLA matching will determine the exact compatibility of the donor and the recipient. The better the match, better the outcome! 

Can anyone be a donor
Voluntary living donors are extensively checked and screened prior to a transplant. A potential donor should be completely healthy without any evidence of on-going disease. 
Under the Sri Lankan law, all male donors should be over 25 years of age and all female donors should be over 30 years of age although this may be subject to individual consideration in exceptional cases such as a parent donating to a child.


Can anyone have a transplant
Almost anyone can have a transplant. Before the intended transplant, the hospital will carry out specific tests to determine fitness for surgery. This will include a few tests including a chest X-ray, ECG and Echocardiogram to determine the fitness of the heart. 


Legal aspects
A potential donor and recipient will initially face an ethical committee examination. 
Then the donors and patients reports are submitted to the Ministry of Health where an independent inquiry into the transplant is conducted to ensure the necessary legal documents are in place. Next, the Director General of Health Services in the Ministry of Health will formally authorize the transplant.
Individual authorization from the Ministry of Health for each transplant is a pre-requisite. Once those authorization documents are received by the hospital, the medical team will finalize the date for the transplant. 


Admittance
The majority of patients for transplants are admitted to the hospital either the day before or the morning of the transplant. Some basic tests are repeated and the patient will have a preliminary dialysis before the transplant. 


After admission
To ensure the patient is ready for the operation, several things will be done. Hair on the chest and abdomen will be shaved. The patient also undergoes a bath with antiseptic soap/solution before the operation. 

The surgery will be carried out under general anaesthesia. Therefore, the patient will fast for approximately 6 hours before the operation.


Process
The transplant is performed in the operating theatre. In a live donor transplant, both the donor and the patient will be operated on at the same time. In the instance of a deceased donor transplant, the donor kidney may be brought from the same or a different hospital. 

The new kidney is placed in the lower abdomen usually on the right side. 
During the transplant, the patient will have a catheter inserted to his/her bladder. This catheter will allow urine to be collected without the patient having to get up and empty the bladder. 


Duration
The transplant operation generally takes approximately 3-4 hours. However, in rare instances, where there is some complexity, the operation may be prolonged. 


After surgery
After the surgery, the patient will be taken to the intensive care unit. The patient will usually remain in the ICU for 24-48 hours. 


Basic precautions
Limit the number of visitors 
	Always wear a face mask 
	Avoid infection transmission  use of antiseptics, hand washing, face mask 
	Eat home cooked meals 
	Take all medications given by the hospital 
	Visit the medical team as advised

Herbs that suit you best according to your Birth Number
	
Ayurveda, perhaps, can be one of the oldest systems of medicine founded in the history of human civilization. Ayurveda while advocating good health habits and practices for maintaining a sound mind and a sound body prescribes herbal medicines for curative treatment. The ancients here and in India in particular have discovered not only medicinal properties in various parts of plants mostly in their own environment, but have also ascertained the herbs that are most efficacious for persons born under varying influences of planets and Birth Numbers.

Ancients knew what modern science has discovered
Modern scientists have discovered the medicinal value of various parts of certain plants through research conducted by very advanced methods. But people in ancient civilizations India, Babylon, Mesopotamia and in certain parts of South America and North America had known the medicinal value of such plants as far back 6,000 years ago.
According to renowned numerologists Number 1 persons - those born on the 1st, 10th or 28th of any month- are prone to heart trouble in some form or other and in the latter stage in their life they develop high blood pressure. They also suffer from defective vision. Some Number 1 people cannot see clearly due to a fault in the shape of their eye. Herbal produce (fruits, leaves, bark, etc.) recommended by ancient Numerologists for Number 1 people include raisins, cloves, nutmeg, oranges, lemon, dates, ginger and barley (barley bread and water). Number 1 people must take honey with garlic on a daily basis.
Important changes in the mental and physical health of Number 1 people occur at the ages of 19, 28, 37 55. The months in which they must take special care to safeguard their health are October, December and January.
Number 2 people - Those born on the 2nd, 11th, or 29th of any month are prone to diseases affecting the stomach and the digestive system. Herbal produce recommended for them include lettuce, turnips, cucumber, kohila (leaves and root), melon.
Important changes in the health of Number 2 people occur at the ages of 20,25, 29,43, 47,52 and 67. They should take particular care to safeguard their health in January, February and July.
Number 3 persons  Those born on the 3rd, 12th, 21st, or 30th of the month are prone to ailments affecting their nervous system mainly due to stress and strain. The main herbal intakes recommended for them include endive, strawberries, apples, pomegranates, pineapple, saffron, nutmeg and cloves.
They should avoid overwork and pay special attention to their health in February, June and December. Changes in their health may occur at the ages of 20,21,30, 48, and 57.
Number 4 people are those born on the 4th, 13th, 22nd, or 31st of the month. They are vulnerable to ailments which cannot be easily diagnosed. They often suffer from melancholia, anemia and pains in the back. The main herbal intakes recommended for them include spinach, green gram, cabbage and avocado. The years in which important changes in their health occur are 30th, 13th, 22nd, 31st, 40th, 49th and 58th.
Number 5 people  those born on the 5th, 14th and 23rd of any month may suffer from ailments affecting the nervous system as they have a tendency to overstrain themselves. As a result, they may suffer from insomnia. Herbal produce recommended for them include carrot and all edible seeds and nuts. The months in which Number 5 people should take care to safeguard their health are June, September and December.

Is your child fidgeting and impatient
	


Do you find your kid highly active and doesnt concentrate on anything you told or asked him or her to do Does your kids teacher continue to complain that he or she isnt engaging in school work properly and prefers to run here and there inside the class room, disturbing other kids as well 

Some parents might find this behavioral pattern completely normal whereas some would worry as to why their kids act in a way which is quite unusual, compared to others. In this article, we are going to discuss about the possible reasons behind this deficiency of attention and hyperactivity in children and how parents can seek help in order to make them function normal. 

What is Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
ADHD is one of the most common neurobehavioral disorders present
during childhood. 

This is a collection of signs and symptoms that include; trouble in being attentive, easily distractable, sudden changes in thoughts, procrastinating, being disorganized, forgetfulness, fidgeting, excessive talking, impatience, interruption and difficulty in completing tasks. 

ADHD consists of 3 subtypes known as inattentive ADHD, hyperactive-impulsive ADHD and the combined form which includes both other types. Out of these, inattentive ADHD is what was previously called ADD which doesnt own hyperactivity like in other forms. As the name itself suggests the second form has both hyperactive and impulsive natures while the combined form has all three including hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattentive (trouble focusing) nature. 

ADHD could be present in adults too. The condition usually lasts during childhood but can be diagnosed later in life. 

It is really important to receive treatment as early as possible, because persisting signs can lead to social isolation, communication problems and poor academic and career skills. 

ADHD is usually addressed with cognitive behavioral therapy including behavioral modification techniques, goal settings, practising strict bed time rules, providing rewards and gifts to appreciate their improvement, form rules and make them follow them and always try to praise so that they get used to consistency. 

Is ADHD the same as Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD)
No, they are not the same. 

The term ADD is actually not used at present as a separate one, since it has been identified as a subtype of ADHD, now referred to as ADHD, Predominantly Inattentive Type(The last time it was known by the original name, ADD was in year 1994). 

The main etiology of ADD is thought to be an imbalance between brain neurotransmitters which are involved in regulating the overall behavior of humans. 

The main characteristic features of this type include inattention and impulsivity where as they dont show hyperactivity at all, as
in ADHD. 

In fact, these children are often found to be shy, reserved and calm, sitting in a corner of the classroom, spending time in their own dreamy worlds, while the teacher is teaching something. Their short attention span and easily distractable nature are prominent characteristics. Furthermore, their inability to maintain attention-which is a step by step process including focus- choose, sustain and resist other things may be misunderstood as some sort of a playfulness. But it is important to identify those signs before the condition worsens, since the problem lies not in the personality, but in the brain. 

Impulsive- These children usually tend to do things quickly even before thinking since there is a difficulty in waiting or delaying gratification. This impulsivity will mostly end up in making them look so playful, speak out of turn, interrupt others and engage in
risk-taking behaviors. 

For an example, they will suddenly get down from the vehicle and cross the road in a spur of a second, even before caretakers notice. They will also blurt out answers, before questions are completed and tend to interrupt the conversations of others since there is no control over their actions by thoughts. 

As far as the other features of such children are concerned, they might show low frustration tolerance, temper outbursts, bossiness, manipulation, difficulty in following rules, disorganization, poor self-esteem, isolation, academic issues and inadequate self-application depending on the age and developmental stage. 

This condition is often noted by school teachers who spend most of the hours with the child. Their parents will be able to confirm it by referring their children to a psychiatrist. 

Treatment for ADD should start at home with a balanced diet, regular exercises, proper attention and care for the child. Physical activities and nutrients which are known to boost the brains Dopamine and Serotonin levels very quickly will result in an improvement from the poor maintenance of attention span and focus seen before. 

Moreover, cognitive behavioral therapy, education techniques involving teachers and families and social skill training will help in making the child act in a less panicky manner. 

Take home messages
Both ADHD and ADD are neurobiological developmental disabilities which affect the part of the brain which regulates attention, behavior and focus. 
	Even though the term ADD was used until 1994, it is no longer referred by this name, but identified as a subtype of ADHD which is known as the inattentive type. Unlike the condition of ADHD, ADD dont present with hyperactivity. 
	Both conditions are treated in a similar manner with the help of cognitivebehavioral therapy.

Know how to manage Asthma
	

Asthma is a common lung condition causing occasional breathing difficulties. Its an allergy, a deep-rooted disease, causing respiratory disorders at any age. Asthma is a combination of hereditary as well as environmental factors. It isnt contagious. Asthma, catarrh, hives, medicine or food allergies are diseases which go together in one person or in a family. Even if asthma is incurable, its possible to keep it under control. During the reach of puberty, asthma naturally fades away for some, but the probability is high for this condition to return.

Respiratory tract and its functioning
The respiratory tract continues from the nose to the lungs. The respiratory system is divided into small tubes which distributes oxygen to the blood circulation system. The tubes help to release carbon dioxide - a by-product of our body. 


What is going on inside
The inflammation of the respiratory tract narrows the muscles around it, making the inner walls highly sensitive. These highly sensitive tracts are vulnerable to the impacts of outside irritants causing asthma and leading the way for the tract to release a thick mucous. After the symptoms of asthma vanish, these changes will return to normalcy. 

Asthma is controlled best by using an inhaler. Theres only a tiny dose of medicine inserted into the inhaler. The medicine within the inhaler moves directly to the infected respiratory tract and controls asthma, therefore the side effects are minimal compared to treating it with pills. Many assume that using an inhaler will become an addiction and therefore are having an indefinite fear of using it. 
A food allergy surfaces several hours after a meal. If asthma patients often suffer from food allergies, it is only then that he or she should avoid those allergic food. Do not give up on having dairy and protein-rich food as eggs, on mere suspicion, because nutrition is most essential for life. If any suspicion arises regarding food, it is better to seek medical advice.



Symptoms
Difficulty breathing 
Crackling and tight chest
Cough
Waking up at night due to one or more of above symptoms
If any child is found to have a cough while engaged in physical activities, it may be a sign that the child is suffering from asthma.


Is your home safe from Maitas
The cause of asthma is a tiny microscopic body which is commonly seen on mattresses, rugs, mosquito nets and stuffed toys. Drying up mattresses and pillows in sunlight, washing bedsheets and mosquito nets frequently with warm water (700C), keeping stuffed animals away from children will help keep asthma at a bay                                                                                                     . 
The Inhaler
The most effective and safest method of controlling asthma is using an inhaler because the inhaler is activated only in the lungs, unlike the tablet which affects the entire body. The low dose of medicine in the inhaler will be more effective. 

There are two categories of inhalers. One inhaler will open up the shrunken respiratory canals and provide a quick relief when asthma pops up. The second one controls inflammation (swelling) of the respiratory system and sensitivity of respiratory canal and should be used frequently for a longer period to avoid symptoms appearing. These avoid reaction with outside irritants also. The second category inhalers should be used regularly, even when the patient isnt suffering from asthma, everyday at the same time. The inhaler keeps the disease under control and protects the lungs. 
There are various inhalers, but the most common inhalers are the ones that come in the form of a dry powder inhaler. There are also the pressurized metered dose inhalers which give the dose under high pressure. It is wiser to discuss the type of inhaler that suits you best with your doctor before usage. 
Inhaler use isnt successful when the patient doesnt breath properly and also when the user fails to use the inhaler regularly in keeping with the doctors guidelines. Therefore proper use is a must in producing the best results.


What is a spacer
It is a device that helps the medicine dose to move more effectively into the lungs and is aided by high pressure. It is important to use this for children and elders. 
An asthma patient should take long-term treatment under the supervision of a doctor and he or she should not stop treatment without the doctors recommendation. 

Pregnancy
Asthma should be well controlled to be safe during pregnancy. If an asthma patient is expecting or expecting a pregnancy, it is better to seek doctors advice. The sudden exposure to cold water can pop up asthma symptoms. But most often, asthma symptoms will increase with the catarrh soon after a bath. If suffering from catarrh be careful not to have baths early in the morning or later in the evening. Using the inhaler during pregnancy is the safest. Feeding the baby with breast milk for the first six months will reduce the risk in a baby of developing asthma. Exposure to passive smoking ( non - smoking person inhaling smoke) during pregnancy will expose a babys health to the risk of developing asthma later in life. 


what if the disease is under control
A patient will be able to engage in any kind of physical activity and sport if asthma symptoms dont surface. 

They are able to enjoy a good nights sleep. 

Inhaler use will be limited to only once or twice or limited terms per week. 

Patients will be able to enjoy the optimum performance of their lungs with the use of an inhaler. 
How to prepare for the next clinical test

Maintain a journal on asthma, including all the symptoms and show it to the doctor. It will help the doctor to prescribe medicine and decide whether to increase or decrease the dose. Mention whether the patient had catarrh or gastritis. 

Take the inhaler to every clinic the patient attends. Clear doubts regarding practical use of an inhaler and check with the clinical staff whether you are using it properly. Inquire more about the duration you should use the inhaler and when it is time to stop. 

Ask how Asthma gets severe and as what to do during an emergency. 
If you have any other doubt or suspicion inquire from nurses or the doctor to avoid confusion.

Triggering factors

Fur-bearing animals - avoid having these animals indoors and avoid any kind of contact with them
	Respiratory diseases like influenza
	Mold (fungi) - The molds inside houses as well as outside environment, can rigorously increase asthma. Repairing leaking water taps, scratching off the mold growing on walls to restrain future growth as well as staying away from hay are beneficial to keep asthma under control. An asthma patient should reveal all the medicines he or she is using to a doctor, whenever a visit is made to the doctor because some medications can stir up asthma. 
	Exercising is also considered a triggering fact for asthma. The asthma symptoms may become visible after some minutes of physical exercises. Warming up before the exercise session and warming down can avoid the risk of increasing asthma. 
Cockroaches: Feces and decaying bodies of cockroaches have the ability to spread asthma. Watch out the places where cockroaches are bred and clean those areas frequently. Keep food tightly closed, and ensure the leftover food and scrapings are sealed away. Thoroughly clean the remnants of dead cockroaches. But sprinkling pesticides can be fatally dangerous for kids. If there are asthma patients at home, be careful in handling the pesticides.

Tips to control your asthma



It is important to stay away from irritants that lead the way for asthma. 
	Dont forget to warm up and warm down during exercise. 
	Using an inhaler 10 minutes prior to exercises is recommended to avoid developing asthma. 
	Make sure asthma is under control before engaging any kind of physical activity. 
	Controlling asthma well ensures a healthy and normal lifestyle. 
	*Doing exercises daily is essential for anyone to lead a healthy and balanced life. 
	If you are a smoker, stop smoking and try to stop others from smoking close to asthma patients. 
	Use a face mask or use protection if exposed to irritants. 
	Maintain proper ventilation in the kitchen (keep windows and doors open while cooking)
	Use properly dried wood when cooking. 
	Do not use plastic, polythene or other artificial materials to keep fires burning
	
Other irritants

Active and inactive smoking
	The fumes from burning wood when cooking as well as the exhaust fumes released by vehicles. 
	Mosquito repellents, sharp scents and air fresheners.

GENEVA AFP Dec20, 2017 -The UNs rights envoy for Myanmar said Wednesday the government had banned her from the country, adding her exclusion suggests something awful is happening in Rakhine state. 
UN Special Rapporteur Yanghee Lee had been due to visit Myanmar in January to assess the state of human rights across the country including in Rakhine, which was plunged into crisis by a military crackdown on the Rohingya minority Muslim community in late August. 
Some 655,000 of them have fled for Bangladesh since then, with accounts of arson, murder and rape at the hands of soldiers and vigilante mobs in the mainly Buddhist country. 
I am puzzled and disappointed by this decision by the Myanmar government, said Lee, who is required to go to the country twice a year in order to report to the Human Rights Council and the UN General Assembly.

MYTH: High carb diets are unhealthy. 
BUSTED: Usually what we include in a healthy persons balanced diet is half a plate for carbohydrates. That is starchy food which comprise cereals, yams and jackfruit. Two thirds of the remaining half have to include vegetables and greens and the balanced one third is for proteins and lentils. This is a normal healthy persons diet. But in Sri Lanka, 75% of our plate contains rice, yams and starchy food. When consuming carbohydrates in the excess make sure to do adequate exercises. Otherwise the excess amount of carbohydrate consumed will deposit as fat in the body and that will increase your body weight, which can be unhealthy, explained Dr. Shanthi Gunawardana, Consultant Community Physician, Non Communicable Diseases Unit, Ministry of Health.

Sylvester Stallone accused of raping woman in 1990
	
(Daily Mail), 21 December 2017 - Sylvester Stallone is being investigated by police for a rape hes accused of committing in 1990.
According to TMZ, a woman recently filed a report with Santa Monica police about the incident which she says occurred during a 1990 meeting at Stallones office.
Although the 10-year statute of limitations has expired, authorities are said to be investigating her claim and that the district attorneys office will decided whether or not to prosecute.
On Wednesday, Stallone admitted he knew the unnamed woman and said they spent three days together in Israel while working on a movie in 1987, three years before the alleged rape.
The film he referred to was likely Rambo III which was filmed in part in Jaffa, near Tel Aviv. 
He denied raping her but did not indicate what the nature of their relationship was.

## Title: The Dugongs under an imminent threat

The Dugongs under an imminent threat
	
Dugongs, a marine species, dwell in shallow waters and are strictly herbivorous animals that have been referred to as the cows of the sea. These enormous vegetarians can be found in warm coastal waters from East Africa to Australia, including the Red Sea, Indian Ocean, and the Pacific. Dugongs are related to manatees and have a similar appearance and behaviour of manatees. However, Dugongs are smaller than manatees. Dugongs graze on underwater grasses and aquatic plants, rooting them with their sensitive snouts and chomping them with their rough lips. These mammals can stay under water for six minutes before surfacing. Dugongs spend much of their time alone or in pairs. These species are the most threatened mammals in the world.
Dugongs are under imminent threat owing to many human activities including fishing, hunting, pollution and development projects
-Director General of the Department of Wildlife Conservation, M.G.C. Sooriyabandara 
He said that Dugongs could be found in Sri Lanka along the Gulf of Mannar and the Palk Bay and added they were vulnerable to extinction under the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. In addition, he said that the Dugong is a protected species in Sri Lanka under the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance. 



Current Threats
Team leader of the Ocean Resources Conservation Association, Prasanna Weerakkody said that dugongs were protected under the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance but however, they were still facing direct threats as follows: 
1. Hunting: legal (i.e. culturally sanctioned) and illegal 
2. Incidental capture in fishing gear. ( Entangled in fish nets) 
3. Boat strikes and boating activities (e.g. acoustic pollution) 
4. Damage/modification/loss of habitat caused by human settlement on coasts, shipping, trawling, destructive fishing, natural processes (e.g. cyclones and tsunamis) 
5. Threats to sea grass (including untreated sewage disposal, coastal dredging and reclamation, in-shore commercial trawling, agricultural pollution) 
6. Chemical pollution (e.g. oil spills and heavy metal loads) 
7. Climate change (extreme weather events and high temperatures) 
8. Development projects
Dugongs face a threat because of the sea grass habitat loss or degradation and coastal development or industrial activities that cause water pollution. If there is not enough sea grass to eat, then the dugong does not breed normally. This makes the conservation of their shallow water marine habitat very important. They also often become victims of by-catch, the accidental entanglement in fishing nets. 
These species were highly protected during the war period owing to the prohibition of the entrance to the marine area by the LTTE and fishing. However, once the war was ended, the limited population of dugongs started to diminish. According to the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance, it is illegal to hunt or kill dugongs, Mr. Weerakkody highlighted.
Cultural Significance
Ranil Nanayakkara from the Biodiversity Education and Research (BEAR) said that traditionally dugongs had also been prized for their hides and oil (valued as a treatment for the hulls of wooden boats). 
The following are some important services of dugongs. 
Dugong meat is considered to have medicinal and aphrodisiac properties. 
	Dugongs immensely contribute towards the proper maintainence of the sea grass grown in the seabed 
	Dugongs have become an important tourist attraction. Tourists can swim with them or observe them from boats. 
	Dugongs are economically valuable while alive as a form of eco-tourism 
Mr. Nanayakkara said that the Dugong and Sea Conservation Project would enhance the effectiveness of conservation of dugongs and their sea grass ecosystems through community-based stewardship. It would also increase the availability of critical knowledge for conservation action for dugongs and sea grass. 
Lets contribute to conserve these innocent dugongs and their sea grass habitat. The significance of dugongs and seagrasses is little at local, national, regional and global levels. This is true from a communal perspective. Therefore, education and awareness programmes need to be developed among the general public in terms of ways of conserving dugongs and sea grass. Further, the strict laws should be regulated to penalize those who illegally slaughter the dugongs and destroy the seagrass by which they survive. 
Conservation Measures
Deputy Director of Conservation Research and Training at the Wildlife Department, Dr. Lakshman Peiris mentioned that several incidents had been reported in the recent past where Dugongs were washed ashore and killed due to malpractices of the people. 
Therefore, projects in collaboration with the Ocean Research & Conservation Association, National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency and Sri Lanka Turtle Conservation Project, have been started to promote the conservation of dugongs (Dugong dugon) and their associated sea grass eco-systems, Mr. Peiris said. 
The key partners of the project are the Global Environment Facility (GEF), Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund and the United Nations Environment Programme.
The Dugong and Sea Grass Conservation Project covers eight countries including Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Madagascar and Malaysia. 
The project has gathered the information through research and transactions with fishing communities in the Gulf of Mannar and Palk Bay. Disseminating this information locally and internationally would greatly facilitate the conservation efforts to protect the Dugongs and conserve the sea grass meadows, Mr. Peiris added. 
The Dugong and Seagrass Conservation Project comprises eight components.

The education discourse and  its ethnic discontents
	
In his Among My Souvenirs Regi Siriwardena depicts the flaws and the contradictions that led to the fall from power of the pre-1956 elite. The plot teeters until the end between autobiographical fiction and historical actuality, particularly with respect to the protagonist, David Gunawardene, and his friend, Wije. These two characters, moreover, represent a bifurcation of the authors political beliefs, dangling between the privileged childhood of David and the more plebeian, less insular upbringing of Wije. The story ends with disillusionment for both of them over the murder of a remnant of the pre-1956 elite: Mark, a Westernised Tamil Christian whose education abroad, and whose repudiation of his own privileged upbringing, makes him idealise a society of chauvinists and rhetoricians, the same society that kills him in cold blood.
Mark represents the rebellion against a particular social segment that thrived on (as that old lady, musing on the world that existed before 1956 in their milieu, tells us in Ruwanthi de Chickeras Dear Children Sincerely) dinner parties and unfinished puddings. What is curious to me about this social segment, largely upper class and English educated, is that they were the people and the leaders who failed to prepare the country for the perils that beset us after the election of S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike. They were not equipped with the proper mindset, the proper attitudes, to take us beyond the chauvinism which 1956 unearthed rather badly. As Siriwardena frequently noted in his essays, being largely a postcolonial elite comprising the descendants of the colonial bourgeoisie, they were too complacent to contemplate productively on the transformation of the country to a nation state unhindered by racial discord.
The majority of this country, before and after 1943, were educated in Sinhala or Tamil
The rift between class consciousness and racial-ethnic consciousness has not, historical texts confirm, always been that easy to sustain. As no less a figure than Professor Nalin de Silva has noted, the proponents of federalism and Tamil chauvinism were by products of the privileged, class bound status accorded to the Vellala caste who formed the bedrock of the Civil Service (before the granting of the suffrage in 1931, bitterly opposed by leaders of that caste-bound community). They were the elite, in other words, predicated on the economic and, by default, the political rather than any racial or religious considerations. Lets not forget, after all, that one of the first private organisations set up to oppose the half-baked reforms paraded as democratic change by the colonialists was the Jaffna Youth Congress, in which the North and the South cohabited in ways which today seem inscrutably idealistic. Had this culture of idealism thrived, it is even possible to contemplate a peaceful transition to the federalist constitution that has got both Sinhalese and Tamil nationalists in a battle for power with, and against, each other today. The idealism, however, soured.
And that idealism today largely flourishes in a context where its greatest proponents and champions come, not from the grassroots, but from the policy elite: the leading members of the NGO intelligentsia, the alternate State sector set up to overlook reforms that delve into the Constitution and ethnic harmony. To me this is a tragedy because it has served to strengthen the (largely mistaken) belief that cosmopolitanism is the preserve of those who are against nationalism. There is much on which I disagree with Jehan Perera, but on one point I agree with him: that Sri Lanka is not a nation, rather a nation of nations, predicated on race and faith. To get those nations together is the difficult task of the government in power, difficult because the government itself, while championing overtly the eventual triumph of a national consciousness over a racial consciousness, covertly caves into the demands of irrational chauvinists.
Had this culture of idealism thrived, it is even possible to contemplate a peaceful transition to the federalist constitution that has got both Sinhalese and Tamil nationalists in a battle for power with, and against, each other today. The idealism, however, soured
The best way for such an idealism to flourish would be this: get the multitude to support it. How does one get the multitude to do this By a cohesive campaign, conducted entirely in the vernacular, that is different in scope and strength to the anti-Dutugemunu anti-Buddhist a historicism of the campaigns that preceding governments affirmed in the name of championing inter-ethnic harmony, by vilifying each and everyone who stood for the Sinhala Buddhist collective. The Sinhala Buddhists cannot be considered as sacred cows, by any stretch of the imagination, but nor should they be demonised for being who they are: as a global minority, they do not have the luxury of numerical strength which most other collectives do. Its a tentative balance that must be struck, and if the strategy is to succeed, the place to start would not be the parliament, or the media, but the most important part of the public sphere: our schools.
Here I go back to the pre-1956 elite, which Mark and David Gunawardene were harbingers of in Siriwardenas book, to point out an interesting contradiction at the heart of their milieu: educated in elite schools, they believed that the absence or rather absenting of a racial consciousness in their classrooms was synonymous with the ideal of inter-ethnic harmony. In other words, cultural apathy was taken as the password to a racially unhindered world. Siriwardena, in an essay on the potential of our schools to do away with those rifts, argued cogently that this misconception belonged to and was sustained by a specific social strata which, at the time of the Kannangara Reforms in 1943, comprised about one-seventh of the total student population, a paltrier one-fiftieth if we were to consider only those who were completely educated in English (without those who received an education in both English and the vernacular).
Now numbers dont lie. The majority of this country, before and after 1943, were educated in Sinhala or Tamil. The minority (L. H. Mettananda would call them a microscopic minority) who were totally or partially educated in English were apathetic to anything but their milieu, which was tempered by a culture of indifference to ethnic and religious realities. Here I quote Siriwardena: ... they failed to recognise that the common identity which they remember sharing was less a common ethnic identity than a class identity, which transcended their ethnic identity as Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, or Burghers. Fluency in the English language and their Western-style dress were distinguishing marks of that class identity, which was in many ways defined through differentiation from the rest of the nation, the majority of whom, who spoke in Sinhala or Tamil, went barefoot and wore sarong, verti, or cloth and jacket.
This conflation of the particular with the general, i.e. the misconception that their elitist education would prove valid for the country, was a reflection of the attitude of indifference which the leaders from this milieu exhibited even when our polity was overtaken by calls for separatism on the one hand and calls for majoritarianism on the other. The Kannangara Reforms, and the advent of democratisation in the education sector, extending to both schools and Universities, achieved two distinct things: one, the opening up of those elitist institutions to the village boy and girl through an examination that standardised intelligence and merit as the gateway to social mobility, and two, the opening up of Central Schools around the country

that could reckon with those elitist institutions.
The single most important social process unleashed with 1956 was Free Education, because it freed our education sector (the most important part of our public sphere, as I pointed out at the beginning) from the elitist minority that believed in a common identity transcending racial identities, an identity that would never materialise without a key prerequisite: the sustained separation of the polity between the minority and the multitude. Free Education did away with that separation.
In this new empowered student population  the descendants of the Ranjiths (Charitha Thunak), the Sirisenas (Thunman Handiya), and the Senas (Akkara Paha) who aspired for social advancement  I see a new hope. True, this population has always been with us, but we need them now more than ever, at a time when cosmopolitanism has been wrongly marketed as anti-nationalism and nationalism has been marketed as anti-cosmopolitanism. They sustain a curious contradiction within themselves, between their roots and their accommodation of a diluted, transcendental identity that comes with exposure to institutions which have opened up to other collectives. Personally for me, there has never been a better time to tap into their dualistic attitude towards that contentious issue of racial discord versus racial harmony, and personally for me, they remain an integral part of the solution to that issue. Right here. Right now.

There are means of improving quality of life
	



Downs Syndrome, also known as Down syndrome or trisomy 21, is a genetic condition that results in physical and mental abnormalities that causes delays in physical and intellectual development. This genetic difference is present from conception itself affecting the person diagnosed throughout prenatal development, infancy, childhood and their adult life. Individuals with Downs Syndrome have 47 chromosomes instead of the usual 46.

Health Capsule got in touch with Dr. Gemunu Hewawitharana, a pediatric neurologist, to shed light on the topic.

Down syndrome is a genetic condition which is non-hereditary. It occurs when an error results in the coming together of chromosome 21. This condition occurs when an individual has 47 chromosomes in each cell instead of the usual 46 chromosomes. Trisomy 21 is caused by an error in cell division which is referred to as non-disjunction. This leaves an egg cell with an extra copy of chromosome 21 before or at conception. The extra copy of chromosome 21 is contributed by the maternal side.
There are three ways Down syndrome could occur. Non-disjunction, translocation and mosaicism. Non-disjunction or in other words, trisomy 21 is the most common type of Down syndrome. It occurs when there are three, rather than the usual two number 21 chromosomes present in every cell of the body. The cause of nondisjunction isnt known, but there is definitely a connection with maternal age. If the mother is older than 35 years of age, the chance her offspring might be diagnosed with Downs increases with the likelihood of the age of the mother. This doesnt change the fact that the offspring of younger mothers are still at risk too. 95% of the time this genetic condition is non-inheritant,Dr. Hewawitharana said.

When asked When asked how Down syndrome can be identified within young children, Dr. Hewawitharana stated that, Children with Down Syndrome can be identified by their external appearance;

Eyes that slant upward and outward
	Below average weight and length at birth
	Floppiness (hypotonia)
	Moon faced (round faced)
	Low set of ears
	A flat back on the head (flat occiput)
	A single crease on the palm
	Wider gap between the first and the
second toe
Hearing and vision problems
	Recurrent infections such as pneumonia
Young children with Down syndrome have an increased risk of leukemia, dementia and congenital heart disease. Down syndrome can affect hormonal problems such as hypothyroidisms or in laymans terms, thyroid hormone deficiency. 

Although there is no cure for down syndrome there is support available to help children with the condition to lead healthy, fulfilling lives. Rehabilitation programs involving multidisciplinary teams that include occupational therapists, physiotherapists, speech and language therapists and special educational teachers in addition to medical staff could help them reach their full potential. Making sure they have access to good healthcare would ensure their physical and psychological development, added
Dr. Hewawitharana.

Prenatal screening tests could help ensure a brighter future for those who are diagnosed with this genetic disorder. They could benefit with early interventions such as physical therapy, speech and language therapy. At the end of the day it all boils down to making sure that there would be ways and means of improving their quality of life.

Trump threatens countries opposing decision  recognising Jerusalem as Israels capital
	

President Trump suggested Wednesday that billions of dollars in U.S. foreign aid could hinge on how countries vote on a U.N. resolution condemning his decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israels capital and move the U.S. Embassy there.
In a Cabinet meeting at the White House, Trump said he would be watching those votes in the General Assembly when it meets in emergency session Thursday on the U.S. decision.
They take hundreds of millions of dollars and even billions of dollars, and then they vote against us, he said. Well, well be watching those votes. Let them vote against us; well save a lot. We dont care.Trumps remarks came after Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, warned on Twitter that the US will be taking names of countries that support the resolution. And in a letter she sent to more than 180 U.N. ambassadors of member nations, she said she would report back to Trump on how they voted.
We will take note of each and every vote on this issue, she wrote. 
On Monday, the United States exercised its Security Council veto to block a resolution on the council declaring Jerusalem. Now, the nonbinding resolution is going to the General Assembly, where the United States does not have veto power.
Neither Trump nor Haley mentioned any specific countries that could be affected. Apart from Israel, only two other countries receive more than $1 billion in annual aid  Egypt and Jordan.

UN condemns Australia's forced return of SL refugee
	
The United Nations refugee agency has condemned Australias forced return of an asylum seeker to Sri Lanka without any assessment of his claim for protection,the Guardian reported on Friday.
The UN refugee agency has said the man,who was forced to return, is at serious risk of persecution in his homeland.
The UNHCR had sought assurances from the Australian government that the man would not be removed from the country and would be allowed to apply for protection.
However, the man had beenforcibly removed from Villawood detention centre on Wednesdayand flown back to Sri Lanka.
The Australian government has maintained that the man was removed because he missed its October 1 deadline to apply for protection, and was deemed not to be seeking protection.
However, lawyers appearing for the man said their clienthad a credible claim for protection, based on his Tamil ethnicity, and familial connection to the LTTE. It is not suggested he was a member of the LTTE.
A spokeswoman for the UNHCR, Catherine Stubberfield said the UN was aware of a number of asylum seekers who were unable to meet the governments deadline of 1 October to submit their applications for asylum.
Since July 2012, people who sought asylum by sea were excluded from lodging an application in Australia for up to four years.While they were all invited to apply by October 2016, some asylum seekers have been unable to complete this process within the time frame for a range of valid reasons, including a lack of access to legal representation. This was the case for the asylum seeker forcibly returned to Sri Lanka this week.
It was a worrying breach of Australias international legal obligations, Stubberfield said.
In this context, the return of an asylum-seeker - whose claim for international protection was not considered on its merits - presents a serious risk of return to danger or persecution.
Regardless of ministerial deadlines, Australia is still legally bound by its non-refoulement obligations under the refugees convention. It cannot return a person to a place where [their] life or freedom would be threatened,Stubberfield said.

UN partiality when dealing with SL
	
The three member delegation from the UN working group on arbitrary detention was in Sri Lanka for a 10 day visit. 
During their stay they visited the LTTE detainees only but not the servicemen who were in remand prison on suspicion. They were not allowed to, by the local UN staff, at least to accept a letter written by the daughter of Commodore D.K.P. Dasanayaka, who is in remand for more than 5 months. 
All she wanted to ask this team was to visit her father too in prison. The Tamil female employer has first asked her whether it was a LTTE complain and when Miss Dasanayaka answered in the negative, she was practically sent out and was never allowed to meet the team. They kept the UN team inside the room until the Dasanayaka family left the location. This happened at the BMICH in Colombo. 
Ben Emerson, the UN representative on Human Rights and Counter terrorism, who came on a 4 day visit to Sri Lanka, threatened the government saying  Implement the Geneva Resolution or face consequence. He further had the audacity to tell that Sri Lanka should not test the patience of the International Community!! Emerson in his report also said that there was very little evidence that perpetrators of war crimes committed by members of Sri Lankan Armed Forces were being brought
to justice. 
The special rapporteur on the Independence of judges and lawyers in Sri Lanka, Ms Monica Pinto, came to Sri Lanka, spent 8 days in the country, and concluded that Sri Lankas judiciary is highly politicized, and judges give verdicts favouring the government, hoping to obtain good positions after retirement! She also mentioned that the judges in Sri Lanka are incompetent, incapable, poorly selected, corrupted, cowardly, partial and the Attorney Generals Department is rather lethargic and defends the interest of only the government and not the public and the Bar Association is strongly divided on political lines None of the legal luminaries in the country objected!. 
It is very obvious that all these were pre-conceived/pre-determined observations, influenced by separatist elements to justify foreign judges, lawyers and prosecutors in special courts in Sri Lanka to try our soldiers. Apart from government officials she has spoken only to pro LTTE lawyers and LTTE detainees in the country. 
The war against LTTE was won on 19th May 2009 and the first resolution passed in Geneva was a positive one praising the Sri Lankan government for bringing peace and condemning the LTTE for using human shields
On 26th March 2014, the UNHRC by resolution A/HRC/25/1 requested the High Commissioner to undertake a comprehensive investigation into serious violations and abuses of human rights and related crimes allegedly committed during the period 2002 February to 2011 November, in
Sri Lanka. 
The final report of the investigation, widely known as OISL (Office of the United Nations High Commission in Human Rights) report, was released on 16th September, 2015. On 29th September, 2015 the UNHRC by resolution A/HRC/30/1 endorsed without reservation the conclusions and the recommendations of the OISL report. The said resolution was sponsored by USA and co-sponsored by the Government of Sri Lanka and adopted by the council by consensus, without a vote.

The OISL report was seriously flawed and full of contradictions, omissions, and obfuscations. A team from the Global Sri Lankan Forum prepared a rebuttal to all the charges mentioned and handed it over to the HC of the UNHRC in Geneva in March this year. One of the charges was that the government had pursued a policy of deliberately denying humanitarian assistance to the civilians trapped in the conflict zone. Mr.Neil Buhne, the UN Resident Coordinator who was a member of the Consultative Committee on Humanitarian Assistance had commented that the Sri Lankan government should be given a Gold Medal for her commitment in providing aid. Mr. Amin Award, the representative of UNHRC, had expressed the view that Sri Lanka was a Role Model to the rest of the world in the manner in which the government of SL had handled the humanitarian crisis caused by the LTTE using civilians as a human shield in the theatre of war. Ms Emelda Sugumaran, the District Secretary to Mulliativu, had confirmed that they had three months stock of food and medicine at any given time. With all these available information Zeid Al Hussein, in his OISL report, had thought it fit to accuse the government of denying humanitarian assistance to the North and the present government had accepted the report with appreciation and co-sponsored the resolution based on that! 
The purpose of the OISL report is to make a case for war crimes against the State. This report was never properly assessed by any professional agency of the UN and it is asserted that the report is deeply flawed and biased against Sri Lanka. Hence UNHRC, in allowing resolution 30/1 to be adopted without a vote and without a debate has been negligent in its duties and obligations under the UN charter and hence illegal. 
The investigation against Sri Lanka, authorized by UNHRC in March 2014 itself is again illegal. The councils authorization of the investigation was based purely on a recommendation for such an investigation made by the High Commissioner where she had no rational basis to make the said recommendation at the time she did.

The war against LTTE was won on 19th May 2009 and the first resolution passed in Geneva was a positive one praising the Sri Lankan government for bringing peace and condemning the LTTE for using human shields. This was after 17 nations led by Germany called for a special session, 8 days after the conclusion of the war, and charged the government of committing war crimes and demanding that the perpetrators be punished. But majority of countries in the council, specially the nations in the South, rejected it and adopted a positive counter resolution as mentioned above. 
That resolution welcomed the conclusion of hostilities, the liberation of tens of thousands of its citizens that were kept by the terrorists and bringing permanent peace to the country. It was obviously a set back to the separatist Tamil diaspora and other critics, who attempted to recover through
other means.

The then Secretary General Mr. Ban Ki Moon came to Sri Lanka just four days after the defeat of LTTE to look into  accountability . When the LTTE held 350,000 civilians as a human shield in January 2009, Ban Ki Moon never came here to prevail on LTTE to release them. When UNICEF was confirming that LTTE were recruiting child soldiers in large scale he did sweet nothing. But he visited Sri Lanka soon after the war, and wanted the government to initiate an accountability process. 
Mr. Ban Ki Moon then appointed the Panel of Experts known as Darusman Committee to appraise him whether war crimes were committed in Sri Lanka. This action of the Secretary General was highly illegitimate and in fact illegal under the UN charter. The Secretary General had appointed three outsiders to the POE committee. But article 100 of the UN charter categorically says that the Secretary General should not receive instructions from any other authority external to the Organization. 
As per article 97 and 98 ,the Secretary General is the Chief Admin Officer of UN and should perform tasks entrusted to him by the Security Council or the General Assembly or the Trusteeship Council. None of these organs had given instructions to the Secretary General in this regard but yet he appointed the POE on his own.
 
The Secretary Geeneral also violated Article 2 (7) of the UN charter which says that, Nothing contained in the present charter shall authorize the UN to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state or shall require the members to submit such matters to settlement under the present charter. 
Hence by appointing the POE the Secretary General had violated his own rules!! 
The Panel of Experts then concluded that there were credible allegations that violations of International Humanitarian Law and International Human Rights Law did occur and recommended an international investigation. The POE then became the basis for the demand for an international investigation in subsequent UNHRC resolutions against Sri Lanka. 
The POE report charged the government of war crimes on false evidence from biased and separatist elements. Referring to the POE report of the UNSG, the International legal luminaries, Sir Geoffrey Nice QC and Rodney Dixon QC , who have both worked in international tribunals and worked for ICC in Hague, say that the findings in respect of the alleged criminal violations fall well short of the legal standards and all the evidence virtually unsourced. Darusman report very clearly mentions, without any reliable evidence, that 40,000 Tamil civilians were killed by the Army during the last stages of war. 
The Darusman or the POE report was never placed officially at the HRC and hence the Sri Lankan government never got a chance to officially respond to it. When the Sec Gen first announced that he would commission the report, senior diplomats in a number of prominent countries expressed grave concerns about the dangerous precedence the Sec Gen was about to set. Russia, through its UN ambassador, even raised objections in the Security Council. The Russian Ambassador Vladimir Mikaylov, when asked on what grounds the objections made said  On the grounds that it was not a UN report. On the grounds that it was not done in accordance of the regulations and procedures of UN. From the very beginning it was told that the report was purely for the Sec Gen. So if it was for the Sec Gen why did they have to publish it  
So based on this illegal Darusman report there were resolutions in 2012 and 2013 and it should be noted that just prior to the March 2013 resolution, a group of 14 nations including Russia, China, Venezuela and Iran made a joint statement expressing their dismay and frustration at what was being done to this country. Referring to mandating the UNHRC to provide advice and technical assistance to Sri Lanka they said such recommendations are arbitrary, intrusive and of a political nature!!. 
Finally the resolution 25/1 passed in 2014 , requesting the present High Commissioner to undertake a comprehensive investigation into alleged war crimes. It was hardly a unanimous decision where 23 countries voted in favour, 12 against and 12 abstained. The OISL report of the present High Commissioner is the result of that investigation.

UN votes to reject Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as capital
	
The United Nations general assembly on Thursday votedto reject US PresidentDonald Trumps unilateral recognition of Jerusalem as Israels capital, the Guardian reported.
The vote came after US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley said that Washington would remember which countries disrespected America by voting against it.
Despite the warning, 128 members voted on Thursday in favour of the resolution supporting the longstanding international consensus that the status of Jerusalem  which is claimed as a capital by both Israel and the Palestinians  can only be settled as an agreed final issue in a peace deal.
Countries which voted for the resolution included major recipients of US aid such as Egypt, Afghanistan and Iraq.
Although largely symbolic, the vote in emergency session of the world body had been the focus of days of furious diplomacy by both the Trump administration and Israel, including Trumps threat to cut US funding to countries that did not back the US recognition, the Guardian said.
Only nine states including the US and Israel had voted against the resolution. The other countries which supported Washington were Togo, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Marshall Islands, Guatemala and Honduras.
Twenty-two of the 28 EU countries voted for the resolution, including the UK and France. Germany, which in the past has abstained on measures relating to Israel, also voted in favour.
Thirty-five countries abstained, including five EU states, and other US allies including Australia, Canada, Colombia and Mexico. Ambassadors from several abstaining countries, including Mexico, used their time on the podium to criticise Trumps unilateral move.
Another 21 delegations were absent from the vote, suggesting the Trumps warning over funding cuts and Israels lobbying may have had some effect.
While support for the resolution was somewhat less than Palestinian officials had hoped, the meagre tally of just nine votes in support of the US and Israeli position was a serious diplomatic blow for Trump.
Immediately after the vote the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, described the result as a victory for Palestine. The Palestinians UN envoy, Riyad Mansour, described the result as a massive setback for the US.
They made it about them. They did not make it about Jerusalem, so when you make it about them and to only be able to get nine votes to say no to it, I think it was a complete failure for their campaign, Mansour has told the AFP.
Israels prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, rejected the UN vote out of hand.
Israel thanks President Trump for his unequivocal position in favour of Jerusalem and thanks the countries that voted together with Israel, together with the truth, said a statement from his office.

US MCC re-selects SL for grant programme
	
The Board of Directors of the US Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) has re-selected Sri Lanka for its grant programme at its meeting held on Tuesday this week.
In a statement, the Sri Lankan Embassy in Washington, said the re-selection will enable MCC to continue developing its compact programme of 2016 with the Sri Lankan government.
MCC compact programmes are large, five-year grants for selected countries that meet MCCs eligibility criteria of good governance, economic freedom and investment in their citizens. The selections are based on performance indicators compiled by MCC in an annual scorecard for countries under consideration, it said.
As required by MCC procedure, MCC re-selects countries already in compact development as part of its annual selection process.
The statement said Sri Lankas re-selection bears testimony to the countrys continued progress on policy performance and reforms, including on democratic rights and control of corruption, and the strength of the governments partnership with MCC since 2015.
MCCs recognition of Sri Lankas progress provides further impetus to the governments political and economic reforms aimed at achieving sustainable peace and economic prosperity, it said.
Since being selected eligible for a compact programme in December 2016, the government of Sri Lanka and MCC have been working together to develop projects with the aim of fighting poverty and promoting economic opportunity for the Sri Lankans.
In July, MCC announced $7.4 million in funding to support the development of the compact, including identifying and analyzing specific projects for potential investment. This amount is in addition to the total MCC compact funding amount, which is to be determined.

Vendors back on pavements for Christmas sales!
	

There are two government politicos racing each other in allocating pavement space in a main city to vendors for them to make a fast buck from the Christmas sales.

The pavements of this city were cleared of improvised stalls and hawkers some time ago, enabling the shoppers and other pedestrians to move about safely. And vendors, thanks to their political patrons, have now begun taking up the pavement space to sell their wares, forcing the pedestrians on to the road, endangering their lives and causing traffic snarls. The two politicos are bringing back the vendors to the pavements with an eye on their vote at the upcoming polls, they say.
