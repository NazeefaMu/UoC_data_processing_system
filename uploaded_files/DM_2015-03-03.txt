Namal hopes the President will resolve the fishing crisis
	
	UPFA MP Namal Rajapaksa said he hoped that President Maithripala Sirisena would resolve the fishing crisis because the postponing of talks would affect the northern fishermen the most.
	Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi worked closely to resolve the Indo-Sri Lanka fishing crisis. I hope President Sirisena will find a lasting solution to it, but the postponing of talks will only affect the northern fishermen because their livelihood was badly affected during the war and are continuing to suffer because of the crisis, Mr. Rajapaksa tweeted.
	International media earlier reported that the Sri Lankan government would seek a postponement of the talks with representatives of both countries. 
	During President Maithripala Sirisenas recent visit to India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasised the need to resume talks between the fishing authorities of both countries.
	Tamil Nadu fishermen suggested that the discussions be held on March 5. However, Sri Lanka has requested for a postponement.
	Our new government has prioritised its 100-day programme and as such so we do not have the time to work on this matter at the moment, Fisheries Secretary Nimal Hettiarachchi told The Hindu.
	The previous round of talks between fishermen of India and Sri Lanka, held in Colombo in May 2014 ended in a deadlock with Indian fishermen demanding three years to phase out trawling, a proposal that their Sri Lankan counterparts found unreasonable.

BMICH promises to pay
	
	The BMICH which was ordered by the Colombo District Court to pay Rs. 187 million as compensation to Dr. Samitha Samanmali, said that it would pay the amount despite its financial problems.
	BMICH director general Mallika Karunaratne said the funds would be collected by any possible means  such as loans or in rent though they were not capable of paying the amount at the moment.
	She said that with the annual turnover of the BMICH it would be difficult to pay the Rs. 187 million compensation but that they would abide by the court verdict.
	"We are going to discuss this matter during our next meeting with our managing board. At the moment, we are undecided as how and when the compensation would be paid," Ms. Karunaratne said.
	Dr. Samitha Samanmali was paralysed in 2008 when a shelter put up for the MED-EX exhibition collapsed on her and, after seven years, the Colombo District Court ordered that a sum of Rs. 187 million be paid as compensation to her. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Probe violation of Kandyan Convention: BBS
	
The Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) organisation today urged the government to launch a domestic probe on the violations of the 1815 Kandyan Convention, the ransacking of the national heritage and the unethical conversion of Buddhists by the British.
It has been 200 years since the signing of the convention, which was severely violated by the British. We urge the government to probe these violations and also the massacre of the people in the country by the British, BBS General Secretary Ven. Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thera told a news conference.
The Thera said the terrorist activities during 1971-1989, the LTTE terrorism during 1983-2009 and the alleged conspiracy that had changed the countrys name Sinhale into Sri Lanka should also be investigated. (Lahiru Pothmulla)WATCH

Audio: 20% salary increment for Water Board employees
	
	The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) has taken steps to pay 20 per cent of the employees basic monthly salary from today as an allowance until the Cabinet approves a salary increase.
	NWSDB Director Mahilal de Silva said the allowance payable for the current month was credited to the employees bank accounts and noted that the Salary Anomalies Adjustment Commission recommendations, which were approved by the Cabinet and the NWSDB Board of Directors, were submitted to the Treasury.
	He pointed out that the salary increments at government institutions should be carried out through a standard procedure
	I believe that the NWSDB trade unions have been informed on the steps taken by the administration in this regard, Mr. de Silva said.
	He said despite the efforts of the Board of Directors to meet the demands made by the trade unions, some individuals with personal agendas were attempting to disrupt the smooth functioning of the NWSDB.
	We will not hesitate to take stern action against them. The proposed trade union action by a group of employees in Kandy today is not justified in view of the steps taken by the administration to grant adequate relief to the employees, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

	The chairman of the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) and convener of the Pivithuru Hetak organization, the Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera said today he was disappointed that the government was not keeping the promises it had made to the people before the presidential election.
	The Ven thera said at a news conference that the government had failed to punish fraudsters and those who had misused public property and been involved in large scale corruption.
	The Thera added that the governments inaction towards the wrongdoers could be due to the inefficiency of the state mechanism and to gain political advantages through political strategies.
	He said the president should take steps to set up a national government because they promised at the presidential election that the 100 day programme included the constitutional reforms and a change in the electoral systems, done through a national government.
	We promised not to set up a UNP government but only to make Ranil Wickremesinghe the prime minister. We promised to set up a national government with the support of all the political parties -- SLFP, UNP, JVP and the JHU, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Video: Secret Navy unit probed
	
	Hinting at the white van abductions several years ago, the Police yesterday revealed an ongoing CID investigation into the disappearance of 11 youths, who were allegedly abducted by a special unit functioning under the Sri Lanka Navy.
	The Police said they have found evidence of 11 missing youths including two Sinhalese, two Muslims and seven Tamils in the areas of Kotahena, Mutwal, Dehiwela and Wellawatta, Police Spokesman SSP Ajith Rohana said.
	Former Navy Commander Wasantha Karannagoda had informed the IGP in 2010 that there was a suspicious unit functioning in the Navy that could be responsible for various abductions for ransom.
	Based on his complaint the Criminal Investigation Department initiated an inquiry and found that the said Navy Unit was responsible for a series of ransom cases based on abduction of numerous youths in Colombo and suburbs during the period of 2008 to 2009, SSP Rohana said.
	The unit operating from Colombo Fort and Trincomalee Naval bases had reportedly used white colour vans to carry out abductions and demand ransom up to millions of rupees in many cases, the CID learned.
	Mostly young men of wealthy families had been abducted But the SSP refused to publicise the details of the missing list yet saying it could be a hindrance to the ongoing inquiry.
	The CID learnt that Former Navy Media Spokesman Captain D. K. P. Dassanayake had acted as the Monitoring Officer of this special unit named as Special Operations Unit. A statement was recorded from one Captain Dassanayake who was grilled by the CID on Saturday in this regard.
	Seven sailors attached to the special unit had also been grilled by the CID so far and statements had been recorded, the SSP said.
	Based on Commander Karannagodas complaint, the CID found National Identity Cards belonging to five of the missing youth sometime ago.
	Statements are being recorded from the respective family members at present.
	Saying that a comprehensive investigation was being conducted into the case, SSP Rohana however refused to reveal the purpose of the special unit established under the Navy, saying it could damage the probe. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana, Sanath Desmond and Piyumi Fonseka)
