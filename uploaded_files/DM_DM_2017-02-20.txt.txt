AIA declares strong 9.46% dividend for customers
	
AIA Sri Lanka has declared a dividend of 9.46 percent for its policyholders. This is yet another year of AIA delivering impressive dividend figures to its customers and this consistency is testament to the strength and outstanding investment strategy of AIAs life fund, which now stands at Rs.32 billion.
Since AIA introduced the system of declaring an annual dividend, the amount declared every year has always been well above the guaranteed amount promised by the company to its policyholders. The dividend is a significant advantage to AIAs customers who are already enjoying protection benefits.
How exactly does AIAs dividend system work and how does it affect AIAs customers AIA Sri Lankas Chief Actuary Frank Munro said, We offer our customers an attractive return on investment, even when the market interest rates were low. Also our policyholders benefit significantly because their premium investments grow with compound interest and not just on a simple interest basis.
He further explained, The premiums all policyholders pay are collected into a single pool  in other words known as the life fund, which is prudently managed by the company to grow whilst protecting the initial investment. The dividend is a percentage of the investment earned from the life fund and is credited to each policyholders individual account after deducting fund management charges. This annual dividend is a simple, significant and transparent benefit for all AIA customers. 
AIA Sri Lanka Deputy Chief Executive Officer and Chief Agency Officer Upul Wijesinghe said, We are happy to announce a great dividend rate for yet another year. Essentially, these high rates of dividends translate into a larger savings for all our customers and add to the superior pension and protection benefits that they enjoy.
Our consistent track record of providing great dividends year-on-year, along with the financial safety and comfort our existing customers have come to appreciate and enjoy, is a clear indication of why more and more Sri Lankans are switching to AIA as their preferred insurance and pension provider.

An historically important work which fills a void
	
This country has seen scores of elections (general, presidential and other) since its independence in 1948. But the three bloody rebellions by its youth (two in the south, and one in the north) have been crucial in shaping the countrys psyche more than the sum of all these elections. They are political barometers by which our political climate can be judged. 
The Tamil rebellion in the north, popularly known as the Eelam Wars, gained wide international exposure, and many accounts of it were written by Western and Indian writers, while there are several books by Sri Lankan authors, too. The JVPs first rebellion in 1971 led by Rohana Wijeweera did not gain the same international exposure, but a few important accounts of it are available, written by high level participants as well as a judge. The JVPs bloodier second rebellion (1987-90) is murkier. No high level participant wrote any account of it. Most were killed, and the few remaining have bloodied hands, a factor which could prevent them from writing. There has been extensive newspaper journalism but these accounts are mainly about the detention camps and torture chambers where thousands of JVP members (and others not connected) were held and put to death. There has been no work giving us the bigger picture, reconstructing the history of these violent and chaotic years in an analytical and coherent manner. 


Dharman Wickremaratnes book The JVPs 2nd rebellion (Javipe Deveni Kerella) is therefore an historically important work which fills a void. Running to almost 900 pages, it narrates the story of the Janatha Vimukthi Peremuna (JVP), its leader Rohana Wijeweera and key members from 1971 to the second rebellion, from its humble beginnings on May 14, 1965, to the final blood-soaked chapters that followed the killing of Wijeweera in Colombo, in November 1989. In putting together the big picture, Dharman Wickremaratne traces the history of Sri Lankas labour agitation and trade union action going back several decades, such as the abortive July 1980 strike. This is important since the deep social malaise which gave birth and impetus to the JVP did not spring from thin air. While he doesnt attempt historical analysis in an academic sense, the author has researched the roots of these two rebellions and the result is a highly readable factual history of this countrys volatile politics from the 1970s onwards. According to independent estimates, over 72,000 lives were lost during the two rebellions, the vast majority of these during the second. While it is doubtful if the countrys leaders learned any lasting lessons from this mayhem, or if any meaningful reforms were brought about as a result, such a dark chapter in Sri Lankan history cannot go unrecorded. More than a gruesome record of the torture chambers is required, and Dharman Wickremaratne has put together here with consummate skill a narrative history of the 2nd JVP rebellion, with the story of its leader and the first rebellion included as a vital backdrop.



This is as close as we are likely to get to what actually happened at the time, because classified records do not exist (if they do by chance, no one knows where they are and the public has no access). By 1989, the police, the army and the paramilitary groups loyal to the government were given a carte blanche to crush the rebellion by whatever means available. This meant wholesale slaughter on an unprecedented scale and they obviously did not want to leave records. Any writer attempting a history of this mayhem faces a Herculean task because he or she would need to rely on survivors and eye-witness accounts and newspaper archival material, which are not always accurate. Dharman Wickremaratne was a 23-year-old reporter for the Sinhala newspaper Divaina in 1987. He covered the rebellion from its start to finish, had extensive contacts at all levels with both sides, and took considerable personal risks. As the author states in his foreword, he was on a flight to Germany in 1990, when it was recalled after take off and he was arrested and later questioned by the CID about his contacts. 


Undeterred, he continued to collect documents, data, letters, photographs and diaries over the years, and mentions two persons who agreed to safeguard this vast collection, which is the source of material for this book. He emphasizes that the story doesnt end with it, nor does he claim that its complete. But it is ambitious in scope and offers in a logical and chronological order, the key events of a very violent and bleak period. 
The author does not attempt socio-analysis or psychological profiles of key protagonists. Rather, he gives an outline of the historical factors and socio-economic forces which gave birth to the JVP, which was a radical but legally established political party as well as an underground political and military movement, according to the dictates of time and place. He concentrates on a detailed history of events and participants, major as well as minor, with an amazing attention to detail. Crammed into 74 chapters and lavishly illustrated with hundreds of black and white photographs of places and people (including the many victims of the JVP and the DJV, its shadowy military wing during the second rebellion), the narration becomes almost a day-by-day account of events  meetings, protests, key decisions, armed attacks, assassinations and abductions. Its a factual thriller based on real life events. 


Unlike many of the survivor-turned journalists who concentrated on the gory details of torture in their newspaper articles, Wickremaratne does not descend into the pornography of violence. He deals more with the causes of that gore, the monumental decisions, as well as mistakes made by Wijeweera, his central committee and their counterparts in the governments and security apparatus. 
He does this in a logical, chronological order and discusses the role played by influential organizations such as the universitys independent students union and its third president Daya Pathirana (abducted and killed in 1986 by the JVP) and the Mavubima Surakime Vyaparaya led by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) but manipulated by the JVP. 
The narrative includes many, now-largely forgotten episodes, such as the abortive pact between the J.R. Jayewardene government and the JVP, signed on May 9, 1989 with minister Lalith Athulathmudali as state representative and the JVPs Upatissa Gamanayake, with Fr. Tissa Balasuriya as one of two witnesses, whereby the JVP agreed to disarm and enter the democratic process (it barely lasted a week). 


The book makes it clear that the JVP was supremely able to harness the nationalist feeling (mainly Sinhala Buddhist but sometimes extending beyond), which became a rallying point for pent-up fury against then president J.R. Jayewardenes high-handed and authoritarian manner. This reached a boiling point when he signed the Indo-Sri Lanka accord with Indian PM Rajiv Gandhi in 1987. Just as the July 1983-anti Tamil riots fuelled the LTTE, this accord and ensuing anti-government riots transformed the JVP into a highly potent alternative force fighting to topple the state, at least in the eyes of those who feared international invention and Indian meddling in Sri Lankas volatile politics. The regimes mix of virulent Sinhala nationalism and pro-Western diplomacy was countered squarely now by the JVPs xenophobia. 


Many examples can be given for the authors attention to detail. For example, when describing the attack on Rajiv Gandhi on July 30, 1987 by naval rating Vijitha Rohana Wijemuni, he mentions the name of the only photographer able to capture the image (Lake House photographer Sena Widanagama) and how the decision to publish this picture only in their city editions was taken by Lake House. The author then describes in detail the family background of Wijemuni and the ensuing trial. Many such examples are found throughout the book. 


The period is full of many such absorbing episodes, including the grenade attack inside the parliament in August 1987. Employee Ajith Kumara, accused of the attack, was later absolved of all charges after a trial. These facts are known. Less known perhaps is the fact that his wife and son (born in 1986) both disappeared after his arrest, and the author states that both were killed. He doesnt say by whom. The story of the Deshapremi Janatha Vyaparaya, the JVPs shadowy and brutal military wing, runs parallel. It was commanded by Saman Piyasiri Fernando, better known by his nom de guerre of Keerthi Wijebahu, a name that struck terror in the hearts of millions. According to the statistics given by the author, the DJV murdered 1,783 UNP members, 485 state officials and employees, 202 soldiers, 187 university and school students, 92 members of policemens families, 70 members of armed forces members families, 52 school principals, 41 Buddhist monks, 27 trade union activists, 18 estate superintendents, 9 journalists and artists, 7 lawyers, 6 leading businessmen, 1 Catholic priest, 200 SLFP members, 141 members of the Mahajana Pakshaya, 43 members of the Communist Party and many more. 


The DJV punished those who dared disobey its dictates during the June 1989 SLTB bus strike ruthlessly. It started locally at Badulla but was soon orchestrated brilliantly by the JVP island-wide to cripple the entire country, with the railways and the private bus operators being forced to join. 137 SLTB employees who dared go to work were killed, and one drivers hands were hacked off and placed on the steering wheel of his bus as punishment. 
With such senseless murder and brutality, by 1989 the JVP was self-destructing. Its terror was such that during the 1988 presidential election, not a single vote was cast at 270 polling centres and 15 opposition candidates for the 1989 general election were killed. The July 1989 JVP central committee decision to end its cohabitation with the SLFP and attack it too was another major blunder. 


But its the August 1989 JVP order given to all armed forces members to quit or face reprisals which delivered the final coup de grace. The Ops Combine was formed under Maj. Gen. Cecil Waidyaratne, with another special ops unit under Col. Janaka Perera, and police SSP Premadasa Udugampola was given a free hand to fight the JVP and the DJV. The result was a bloodbath which wiped out almost the entire underground leadership within a matter of months. Despite its virulent nationalism, the JVP maintained contacts with a number of Tamil separatist groups and these details too are given along with a sketchy history of the Tamil armed struggle. Though the JVP was overwhelmingly Sinhalese, it had a few very active minority members too. One was a brilliant and popular Tamil student leader called Ranjithan Gunaratnam, who became the JVP leader for Western and Sabaragamuwa provinces. He was arrested in December 1989 and killed in January 1990. Among its few Muslim activists, engineering undergraduate S.M. Nizmi was one. When he was arrested in January 1990, he was a JVP central committee member and was killed soon after. 
Many brilliant and capable people from both sides perished. What was achieved in the end after such enormous sacrifice The author does not proceed to answer such questions. He sees his task as one of documenting in a coherent manner a mass of detail and reportage of a very murky era, and in this he has succeeded quite well. Has he been impartial But total impartiality would be impossible in such an undertaking. Lord Russel of Liverpool, one of the chief legal advisers during the war crimes trials at Nuremberg and Tokyo after WWII, wrote two outstanding books about Axis war crimes  The Scourge of the Swastika and the Knights of Bushido. He represented the Allied side and was a firm liberal. But this did not make him exaggerate or invent. Thats the most important thing. Similarly, one feels that author Wickremaratne has worked within the bounds of historical truth and decency. Because of the very nature of its subject matter, some parts of the book are bound to be controversial. But its hard to think of anyone else better placed to undertake such a monumental task and he doesnt consider it complete. The second part of the book will resurrect more of this unwritten history.

Are we hit by climate change
	
SL experiencing climate change effects, says Sir Robert Tony Watson 
The global climate will change in the present century swiftly at rates unprecedented in recent human history. The risks associated with these changes are real but highly variable. Societal vulnerability to the risks associated with the climate change may exacerbate ongoing social and economic challenges, particularly for those parts of societies dependent on resources that are sensitive to changes in climate. Risks are apparent in agriculture, fisheries, tourism and many other areas that are critical to the livelihood of both the rural and urban populations especially in developing countries such as Sri Lanka.

"All countries do suffer from climate change as it affects physical systems including the coral reef system, rainfall, rivers and lakes. However, when you consider the situation in Sri Lanka, it could be observed that the island is vulnerable to climate change. "

Sir Robert Tony Watson is a British chemist who has been described by the New York Times as an outspoken advocate of the idea that human actionsmainly burning coal and oilare contributing to global warming and must be changed to avert environmental upheavals,. 
During his recent visit to Sri Lanka he expressed his views with the on climate change, its consequences and how it affected the world and Sri Lanka in particular. He has worked on atmospheric science issues including ozone depletion, global warming and Paleo-climatology since the 1980s.
He was the former Director of the Science Division and Chief Scientist for the Office of Mission to Planet Earth at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). 
Excerpts: 
What is climate change 
Over the last 100 years or so, people across the world have released greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and they have changed what we call radiation balance or atmospheric temperature.
As a result of this immoral practice, we have seen changes in the temperature, precipitation patterns as well as the sea level. This is climate change. 
How has it affected Sri Lanka 
All countries do suffer from climate change as it affects physical systems including the coral reef system, rainfall, rivers and lakes. However, when you consider the situation in Sri Lanka, it could be observed that the island is vulnerable to climate change.
The most recent example that could be drawn is the drought that severely affected the whole of Sri Lanka. The country also saw the sea levels rise every now and then, thereby causing saltwater intrusion. 
We also monitor changes in commodities like agriculture-based products. The current drive in Sri Lanka is having adverse impacts on paddy fields, and is giving a second chance to dreadful maladies including Dengue and Malaria to raise their ugly heads. 
On a different note, we should also discern that Sri Lankans have a responsibility to protect its treasured forests and other natural resources.
The people should care for agriculture, coastal draws, and natural habitats and especially be conscious about conserving water as all these elements directly or indirectly impact on climate change. 
As a scientist, how do you view the eco-system in Sri Lanka 
Sri Lanka is undoubtedly battered with a massive drought. When I toured the Yala National Park a fortnight ago, I was disappointed to see the tanks drained. We cannot, however, infer that this drought situation is solely due to human-induced climate change; although it significantly contributes to the cause. Anyhow, we should expect similar and much more destructive droughts in years to come.
It is now high time to think of an effective and long-lasting mechanism to conserve water as it affects the eco-system in Sri Lanka. 
As global warming is considered an alarming situation, in your capacity, what do you recommend as safety measures to protect our nation from this danger 
I believe that all countries fall victim to human-induced climate change; the poor countries suffer the most. We see developed countries equipped with technological, financial and institutional capabilities to address climate change. In the Sri Lankan context, the main weakness I see is that the people fail to manage the freely-available water system. They should assure that water is not wasted. 
The people of Sri Lanka should give serious thought to means of managing ones agriculture, cropping and shifting into the right crop, rising sea levels, putting up seawalls, retreating land of the seabed and so forth, as they determine to what extent climate change affects the island nation. 
We now find climate adaptation funds in abundance, which Sri Lanka could benefit from. Sri Lanka should improve on the efficient use of energy. The people should utilise the specified equipment and other apparatus in construction and transportation industries. Further, Sri Lanka should reap the harvest of technological advancements -- people should concentrate more on cost-effective channels of using renewable energy and what we call modern bituminous. So what Sri Lanka needs to do is to reduce earths gas emission. 
How can the public and private sectors contribute to save the green 
In my opinion, it is imperative that the administration works closely with the private sector. Climate change could be addressed only if the government puts in place apt policies, follows effective procedures and enforces stringent laws. It should encourage renewable energy and water resource management in agricultural practices. Then, the private sector will see opportunities in establishing advanced energy and irrigation schemes. Thus, both sectors will collaborate to mitigate climate change. Its a win-win situation. 
You reiterated many a time that humans were instrumental in causing climate change. Why 
Well, as individuals, all of us can use our energy more efficiently to deal with climate change. The public should push the government towards real action, and the industries towards sustainability. 
As individuals, we can save energy, water and other valuable resources. We should exert pressure on the government and other responsible governing bodies for this worthy cause. The media would undoubtedly be an effective channel of approach. The people should be made aware of the subject and its consequences. They should know how destructive it could get if this practice was to continue. As I mentioned earlier, climate change is human-induced. Hence, the human race does not merely have a duty but a responsibility to resolve this dilemma. 
Finally, what is the message you wish to convey to the world 
I would say climate change is a very serious issue that could affect everyone. With the height of technology, we surely have what it takes to address, or at least to limit, climate change. Thus, we should utilise renewable energy and adapt to climate change thereby managing water, agriculture and coastal zones more effectively.

A group of leading Buddhist Monks today called for the ban of school big matches saying that the matches acted like a platform for promotion of alcohol among students leading deterioration of social values.
Addressing a news conference held at the Government Information Department, Ven. Omalpe Sobitha Thera, the Founder of the Sri Bodhiraja Foundation, said that the big matches should be banned in the name of morality.
The Principals and authorities, including past students should take the responsibility and ban these matches. If not, the law enforcement authorities should ban them. Big matches and related events had become public nuisance today. Students consume alcohol and then damage public properties, the Thera said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

## Title: Claim of traditional homelands: not a load of balderdash

Claim of traditional homelands: not a load of balderdash
	
I refer to the article headlined Wigneswaran and puppeteering with Ghosts, by Mr. Malinda Seneviratne, in the Daily Mirror of February 9, 2017.
I focus attention only on four (4) interconnected points of Mr.MS as follows: I quote-
(a) The claim of traditional /historical homelands is a load of balderdash unsupported by any kind of evidence
(b) There are no archeological props, there is no subaltern history and even literary kind of evidence, is at best weak and easily debunked.
(c) Just the fact that they blur the truth with multi-ethnic talk.when asked about numbers and percentages, and it is actually sad.
(d) Almost half the Tamil population lives outside the homeland and the bottom falls out of the argument.


I comment on above statements of Mr. MS, not as an ethnic Tamil, although I am a Hindu. My purpose is to present the facts objectively rather than view it with a racial bias.
Re- (a) above: I wish to ask Mr. MS whether there were any Sinhalese traditional homelands prior to the arrival of Vijaya (More correctly Vijay or Vijayan) from India in 500 B.C. and later during the introduction of Buddhism in 247 BC 
Could Mr. MS give evidence of Sinhalese settlements prior to 500 BC
Obviously not; because the Sinhalese race is said to be founded by Vijaya in 500 BC only, according to the historical chronicle Mahavamsa by Mahanama. In fact the founding of the race is a myth. Because, not a single race in the world have been founded by an individual. Can Mr. MS give the names of individuals, who founded the European, Slavonic, Chinese, Mongoloid, Japanese, Aryan and the Dravidian races, to mention a few I bet not; because races evolve organically by people living together, with common customs, beliefs and dialects. Sinhalese are the only unique exception to this universal phenomena.
Who was Ravanas (more correctly Ravanan) grandfather Pulasthi, who ruled from Pulasthinagar in the North (Name later changed to Polonnaruwa by Sinhala historians) and Ravana, later king of Lanka
Were they Sinhalese rulers Mr. MS, can you provide an answer
I dont think so. Because, the truth is the pre-Vijayan and later pre-Buddhistic inhabitants of Lanka were a mix of Dravidians, comprising Tamils, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalees. Can Mr.MS tell us who King Devanam Piyatissa (More correctly Devanambya Alwar Tissan) and his father Mutsiva (More correctly Muthusivan) were


Were they Sinhalese rulers What was the religion of King Devanam Piyatissa, before his conversion to Buddhism in 247 BC by Arahat Mahinda (Mahendra) Surely, he must have had a religion.
Mr. M.S would, in his own words, have to indulge in navel and toe gazing  to these questions. The truth is King Ravana was a Tamil and a Hindu and an ardent devotee of Lord Shiva and received the boon of Lord Shiva by observance of tapas. He was a great practitioner of Ayurveda and during his time the great Indian Ayurvedic Scholar, Danwanthri attended a Conference on Ayurveda in Lanka. There is Brahmi rock inscriptions to support this. King Devanambya Alwar Tissan was not even a Tamil but a Telugu Hindu.
Re- (b ) Mr. MS debunks that there is no evidence of any historical kind. He seems to be unaware of the architectural, epigraphical (Brahmi rock inscriptions) and literary , and place names etc, which establish the veracity of the fact the pre- historic population consisted of Hindu Dravidians, long before the emergence of a Sinhalese religio-linguistic identity.
There was no fully developed Sinhala language till about the 7th century A.D. Sinhala language was created , basing on Tamil Alphabatics and Grammar (Virasolium) and 90 % comprising modified Sanskrit and Tamil words. What more evidence is needed for Ravana, than the corroborative literary evidence of the Epic Ramayana authored by the great Sage Valmiki around 7000 years B.C, which refers to the King of Lanka, Ravana.


Other historical evidence in Lanka like the remnants of the Adams Bridge in the Palk Strait linking Lanka and India , place names as Seetha -Eliya, Ramboda (Correct name Ram Bhoda) and other temple architecture of the five (5) Iswarams, Thirukoneswaram of Trincomalee, Munneswaram of Chilaw, Thirukeetheeswaram of Mannar, Naguleswaram of Point Pedro and now defunct Thondeswaram, in Dondra, in the South.
Besides, the worship of Lord Shiva and Lord Murugan at the sacred temple at Kataragama (More correctly Kathirgamam) existed around 13, 000 years BC. Even the Sigiriya rock was in pre-historic times was called  Shivagiri mountain, which later was changed to Sigiriya. There are over hundreds of Brahmi Rock inscriptions (Prof. Dr. Paranavitarane refers to them) confirming the Holy Yatra made by several Saints, Sages, Munis and Yogis, including the Great Agastya, who came to the sacred Kataragama and worshipped Lord Murugan.
Isnt this evidence enough to prove the existence of a mix of Dravidian Hindu inhabitants in Lanka during the period of the Ramayana and beyond The existence of pre- Vijayan and pre-Buddhistic Hindu temples, millennia before the arrival of so-called Vijay and Arahat Mahinda, proves that the Tamils and other Dravidian Hindu races, was the majority population of Lanka.


Re- (c) about numbers and percentages of race break-down of population of the post-Christian era. With the conversion of King Devanam Piyatissa and large numbers of the subjects of his kingdom to Buddhism in 247 B.C, which comprised Tamils and other Dravidian races, the Hindu Tamils and others became a minority.
Although they were converted to Buddhism, they continued with their Hindu customs, religious practices and worship of Hindu deities. Some followed the strict adherence to the Precepts of Buddhism, and opposed the ritual worship of Hinduism.
This led to the Schism in Buddhism, not only in Lanka, it started in North India, and the dichotomy of Mahayana and Theravada Buddhism came about. The Abhayagiri and Mahavihare became the centres of the respective schools of Buddhism.
Can Mr. MS deny this development Thus the ancestral progenitors of present day Sinhalese are the converted Tamil Buddhists. With the creation of a separate language, by modification of Sanskrit and Tamil words (about 90%) and a sprinkling of Pali, Portuguese and English words, the Sinhala language was born.
Since the beginning of the Christian era, a period of over 1,000 years, by reproductive natural increase, the Sinhalese became, percentage-wise, the majority. These are the truths, which are unpleasant and unacceptable, to the Sinhalese psyche.


"The British were not that stupid to demarcate territorial lines for efficient rule without a rational basis. They were based on the rationale of a de-facto reality. Wasnt the same British, who gave a Unitary State and Constitution for their centralised government, when in reality, there was never a centralised Lanka"

Today, the residual Tamil population, a significant minority, is deemed as outsiders, who came from South India. Whereas, the prehistoric history, as averred above, establish the fact of they being the primordial inhabitants of Lanka. Of course, there must have been an inflow of Tamils during the Chola invasion and rule, which lasted for 44 years and in modern times the British bringing in the Tamils from South India to work on their plantations.
The Tamils and other Dravidians did not come from India. They came along with the land mass called Illankai in Tamil, when the Continental land mass connected to South India, called the Commorikandam in Tamil and the geological name Demuria, which sank and dismembered in the great Ocean Storm (Tsunami) around 9,000 years BC.
The name Lanka was derived from the Tamil name Illankai by deletion of the first two letters and the last letter.
Re- (d) that half the Tamil population lives outside the homelands- the bottom falls out of the argument. This is a lame argument to deny the existence of an identifiable territorial region as homeland of the Tamils. The homeland does not disappear, merely because half the population is outside the region. This is due to two reasons:
(1) Job opportunities
(2) Security.
North East is the least developed region. Metropolitan Colombo district is the most developed and where job opportunities are.
So, the drift to Colombo is natural. They are settled and live in the Colombo District. Does this mean they have severed their connection with the place of birth No. They have family connections with their homeland.
The other reason is their homeland was engulfed in a fratricidal war, terrorism and instability, constant aerial bombings, break-down of civilian life, lack of amenities, food, medicines, schooling , fear of child abductions, which perforce made them seek a safe and secure life in the South.
These two combined factors make up the reason detre for their living outside their Homeland. It is precisely for this that, a once and for all solution, is needed to settle the so-called Tamil problem.


If the Tamils are given the necessary political power to govern themselves, under a federal framework, development would result in job opportunities, and peace and stability will attract a backward inflow to the Homeland, not only from Colombo, even from abroad.
Living out of their homeland is not abandonment of their place of birth- the homeland. By extension of this irrational argument, thousands of Sinhalese settled down in the Western countries cannot call their place of birth, Lanka, as their motherland.
Mr. MS also refers to arbitrary lines of territorial demarcations made by the colonial Rulers ,the British.
The British were not that stupid to demarcate territorial lines for efficient rule without a rational basis. They were based on the rationale of a de-facto reality. Wasnt the same British, who gave a Unitary State and Constitution for their centralised government, when in reality, there was never a centralised Lanka, prior to the advent of the first colonial power, the Portuguese.
There existed only three independent and sovereign kingdoms- the Kotte Kingdom, the Kandyan Kingdom and the Jaffna Kingdom. Can this historical truth be denied by those who prattle about historical evidence of various kinds
The Sinhala Government and their chauvinists, gleefully accept the British unitary State and Constitution, and insist on this, but not their regional lines of demarcation of the North and East. I think I have adequately dealt with the matters referred to by Mr. MS and he is welcome to counter my views, if I am wrong, and enlighten me.

Govt. turns down all JO proposals on new Constitution: Vidura
	
The Government had turned down all proposals made to the Subcommittee on Centre-Peripheral Relations by the Joint Opposition (JO), depriving the opportunity to establish the unitary nature of the State in the process of making the countrys new Constitution, the JO claimed today.
Addressing a press briefing the JOs subcommittee representative Parliamentarian Vidura Wickramanayake said that on behalf of the group he produced 14 suggestions with the support of MP Sanath Nishantha, which had been rejected by the government. 
Not a single suggestion, we made, was considered while setting this up. The Steering Committee with six subcommittees has been assigned to this responsibility under the patronage of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, he said.
He said that though the Government though utters continuously that it would not breach the unitary state of the country, the content of the new constitution was not consistent.
The facts in the new Constitution report could divide the country. Today the President has the authority to pressurise the Provincial Councils and control the wrongdoings through the Governor. So far Parliament has the sole power in law making. But it could be loosened if the Government enacts this new Constitution, he said.
Mr. Wickramanayake also said that they suspected the intention of producing such a constitutional report might be a step to push the country back to the dark ages.
No one could save the country becoming the next Israel or Lebanon, he said.
Meantime, he said that a Constitution was a document that used for decades for the purpose of securing the peoples privileges.
The MP warned that the Constitution report government had introduced was preplanned and not fulfilled the countrys true needs.
Mr. Wickramanayake said that discussions were under way to withdraw their membership from the subcommittee as there was no room for the Joint Oppositions voice.
The Constitution the Government is trying to implement only pose unhealthy results to the country as it will only serve a few politicians, he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

HNB partners with UnionPay International for cards
	
Introducing another pioneering initiative to the Sri Lankan banking industry, HNB announced a new partnership with UnionPay International, to accept card payments from one of the largest payment networks in the world.
Through the new agreement, the Sri Lankan merchants who operate HNB point-of-sales (POS) devices will now be able to accept UnionPay cards, empowering businesses across the island  particularly with regard to the formal and informal hotel sector, traditional crafts, jewellery and restaurants  to cater to a massive new market of potential customers with ease.
HNBs partnership with UnionPay International is without any doubt a historic achievement for the Sri Lankan banking industry. Over the last year alone Sri Lanka recorded tourist arrivals from China well in excess of 270,000 visitors and it is anticipated that these figures will only increase in the coming year. 
By moving proactively to partner with UnionPay International, we believe HNB has taken a vital first step towards further integrating Sri Lanka into the international economic system while at the same time supporting the Sri Lankan businesses to tap into a large and lucrative new customer demographic, HNB Senior Manager Card Centre Roshantha Jayatunge stated.
We are delighted to be partnering with HNB. Sri Lanka is an important market for UnionPay International in South Asia. We are uniquely positioned and ready to contribute to the growth of the tourism industry in Sri Lanka by providing travellers with the secure and easy payment option, UnionPay International Senior Head South Asia Derek Chang said.
Now, the UnionPay global acceptance network has expanded to 160 countries and regions, providing safe, convenient and preferential payment services for its global cardholders. With more than six billion cards issued accumulatively in 40 countries and regions, UnionPay has not only become the major payment brand of the Chinese outbound tourists but is also the preferred payment option for an increasing number of customers from markets outside mainland China.
HNB currently stands as the dominant leader in card acceptance in the Sri Lankan market and together with the roll out of UnionPay International in Sri Lanka, the bank also plans a similar expansion into the Maldivian market later this year.

Iraq starts operation to drive ISIS from Western Mosul
	

Iraqi forces captured several villages on Sunday, as they advanced from the south toward the western side of Mosul that is still under control of Islamic State, Iraqi military said. 
Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi earlier on Sunday announced the formal start of the ground offensive on western Mosul, asking the Iraqi forces to respect human rights during the battle. 
The Islamic State militants are essentially under siege in western Mosul, along with an estimated 650,000 civilians, after U.S.-backed forces surrounding the city forced them from the east in the first phase of an offensive that concluded last month. 
Mosul would be a tough fight for any army in the world, the commander of the U.S.-led coalitions forces, Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, said in a statement. 
Iraqi planes dropped millions of leaflets on the western side of Mosul warning residents that the battle to dislodge Islamic State was imminent as troops began moving in their direction, the Iraqi Defence Ministry said on Saturday. 
CNN reported as many as 800,000 civilians live in western Mosul, according to the United Nations. It said UN humanitarian agencies would assist civilians caught in the fighting.The report added the offensive to retake Mosul from ISISs began in October with a push by the Iraqi army, counter-terrorism forces, federal police and Kurdish Peshmerga fighters. 
ISIS seized Mosul, Iraqs second-largest city, in 2014. It is the militant groups last major stronghold in the country.

500 more dual citizenships to SL expatriates
	
Minister S.B. Nawinna said the Government hoped to issue nearly 25,000 dual citizenships to expatriate Sri Lankans on the basis that it would give an opportunity to Sri Lankans domiciled in foreign countries to contribute to the development of their Motherland.
He said this at a ceremony held today at the Smart Tower to distribute 500 dual citizenships to expatriate Sri Lankans.
For several decades you may have lived in a foreign country without an opportunity to give back something to your Motherland. Therefore, I appeal to you to do your utmost to introduce Sri Lanka to your friends and colleagues as it will be big a boost to our tourist industry, the minister said.
He said Sri Lnkans living abroad may have fled the country because of the ethnic conflict, suppression of their rights by the then government or scared of the State-sponsored terrorism. B
"But Sri Lanka under the Unity Government has become one of the most peaceful and fast developing country in Asia. That is why the Government decided to issue dual citizenships to expatriate Sri Lankans and their siblings who may have not stepped on their Motherland before," the minister said.
A Sri Lankan adults must pay Rs.300,000 and Rs.50,000 by children under 18 to obtain a dual citizenship.
The Emigration and Immigration Department has issued more than 15,000 dual citizenships since it was introduced in March 2015. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

N. Korea behind Kim murder: Seoul
	
SEOUL AFP Feb19, 2017- Malaysias investigation into the murder of the North Korean leaders half-brother shows that the Pyongyang government was behind the assassination, South Korea said Sunday. 
Malaysian police have arrested one North Korean suspect and are seeking four more North Koreans who left the country last Monday, the day Kim Jong-Nam was poisoned at Kuala Lumpurs main airport. 
Based on various factors, our government is certain that the dead man is Kim Jong-Nam, and considering that the five suspects are North Korean nationals, we view that the North Korean government is behind the incident, said Seouls unification ministry spokesman Jeong Joon-Hee. 
Jeong declined to provide further details, citing the continuing probe in Malaysia. 
Jong-Nam, the half-brother of leader Kim Jong-Un, died after an unidentified liquid was sprayed in his face at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Seoul says the attack was carried out by female agents on Pyongyangs orders.

NDBIB retains market leader position in listed debentures through 2016
	
NDB Investment Bank Limited (NDBIB) reaffirmed its supremacy in the capital market by successfully raising a total of Rs.31.5 billion through listed debentures during 2016 as the sole manager to the issue and jointly. From this amount, Rs.19.0 billion was raised for commercial banks, Rs.10.5 billion for finance companies and Rs.2.0 billion for corporates.
As in 2015, NDBIB once again posted an unmatched market share of approximately 38 percent in listed debenture issues during the year 2016, maintaining its market leadership position. NDBIB has the largest cumulative market share (38 percent) of all the listed debenture issues to date since the introduction of tax incentives in 2013 by the government to develop the capital markets.
Furthermore, for its superior execution of transactions in the debt, equity and corporate advisory space, NDBIB was crowned as Sri Lankas Best Investment Bank 2016 for the fifth consecutive year by Euromoney, the worlds premier financial markets magazine, bearing ample testimony to NDBIBs continuous quest for excellence and innovation within the investment banking sphere in the country. NDBIB is honoured to be the only investment bank in Sri Lanka to have achieved this feat.
Commenting on the market leadership of NDBIB, NDBIB CEO Darshan Perera stated, We are extremely proud to have continued our leadership position in managing listed debenture issues from 2015 to 2016. We are steadfastly committed to strive for excellence and innovation thereby adding value to our clients and propelling the countrys capital markets to the international pedestal. The economic growth and prospects of the country will naturally call for best-in-class knowledge and practices in our capital markets in order to cater to the growing needs.
He also added, In the investment banking sphere, all the players thrive to win a coveted award from a prestigious institution and NDBIB has reached this pinnacle five times consecutively. NDBIB Chief Operating Officer Kaushini Laksumanage mentioned, It is indeed a proud achievement for us at NDBIB to be the number one investment bank in the country in managing listed debenture issues during 2016, particularly when considering the volatility that prevailed in the capital markets during this period.
Adaptability and innovation are critical success factors in the dynamic financial services spectrum and hence these achievements provide ample evidence of the success achieved by NDBIB in its quest for continuous improvement. I am confident that these achievements would motivate the NDBIB team and inspire us to achieve greater heights.
It is expected that there will be a decline in the issuance of listed debt securities going forward due to the removal of tax incentives previously offered to these products, through the budget 2017. However, NDBIB views this as an opportunity to introduce innovative new products that can fulfil the unique requirements of both investors and borrowers by giving them best possible opportunities under the prevailing market conditions. NDBIB is well positioned to continue its dominance during the current year with a strong pipeline of deals with the expected improvement in the capital markets.

Retired Major deported from Hawaii for alleged sexual abuse
	
A retired Sri Lanka Army Major attached to the Disaster Management Center (DMC) which was sent for a training programme in Hawaii, was deported last week after he was charged with allegedly sexually abusing a female employee at the hotel he was staying in, the Daily Mirror learns.
The victim, a mechanical maintenance worker, was called to fix the air conditioning system in the suspects room on February 9. The suspect had locked the door, when she entered the room and allegedly sexually abused her, sources said.
Official sources confirmed the suspect was part of a group sent by the Sri Lankan Government to Hawaii for a course on disaster management rescue and operations.
The Hawaiian Court which remanded the suspect, later directed he be deported to Sri Lanka and decided to take up the case again in April. The suspect returned to the country on Friday, February 17.
Meanwhile, officials at the Disaster Management Center (DMC) said the official had been sacked with immediate effect.
The US Embassy has also taken measures to inform the relevant authorities of the incident. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Samurai to the rescue
	
Sri Lanka would overcome its foreign currency payment, which will reach a staggering USD 4.08 bn (About Rs.560 bn) by end of this year, USD 5.7 bn (Rs.570 bn) by end 2018, through Samurai Bonds and by swapping of debts, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
A samurai bond is a yen-denominated bond issued in Tokyo by non-Japanese companies, and is subject to Japanese regulations.
Speaking at the opening of 20 housing units for the landslide victims of Aranayake yesterday morning the Prime Minister said revenue from Samurai bonds and swapping of Hambantota Port debt against a stake would help the country to reduce the debt services by end 2017.
"Some have filed court cases against the signing of Hambantota Port Agreement without considering the country's situation," Mr. Wickremesinghe said.
"If we do not pay our loans, the foreign debt services alone will rise by trillions of dollars by the year 2025," he added.
He said the country would face this situation irrespective of domestic debt services. Domestic debt services by end 2017 would rise to Rs. 794 bn and to Rs 959 bn by end 2018.
"We will have to put the economy on the right track, while concentrating on reconciliation and power sharing," he said.
He said only reconciliation and a stable economy would help the Government to create employment.
"We have to generate employment especially in the North. The original grievance of the Northern and Eastern youth was unemployment and the failure of the respective Governments resulted in the war. This war pushed Sri Lanka back so much that only Laos and Cambodia were lagging behind Sri Lanka. If we fail to generate employment now both Cambodia and Laos would also will beat us," he further said.
Mr. Wickremesinghe also stressed the importance of reconstructing disaster affected areas.
"The Unity Government of the two main political parties helped quick reconstruction of Aranayake. Lack of unity among the political parties made the post-tsunami reconstruction lag for many years," he said.
Minister of Power and Renewable Energy Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said there was much to be done when it came landslide reconstruction in Kegalle.
He said government was faced with a task of finding land for 2,000 families.
Minister of State Enterprises Development Kabir Hashim said the Government had done much when it came to reconstruction of the landslide areas, though no publicity was given. He said all these work was done with the joint effort of all politicians, government officials and religious leaders in the area. (Yohan Perera)

Save Your Monkey insurance comparison website launched
	
Insurance is viewed as one of the many tiresome legal obligations by most Sri Lankans. The real purpose of it and the value it serves is overlooked by many. They fail to appreciate insurance, simply because it seems too complicated to understand and even more tedious to procure.
As a young brand that believes in achieving simplicity through innovation, Save Your Monkey envisions in making insurance accessible to everyone, by simplifying the process of procuring a policy through saveyourmonkey.com, Sri Lankas most comprehensive online insurance comparison platform.
Saveyourmonkey.com allows consumers to compare multiple insurance quotations and procure a policy immediately, while SYM insurance brokers facilitate the entire process. The service offered by Save Your Monkey doesnt just involve helping customers to compare and buy insurance, but also extends to the point of delivering the policy documents to the doorstep of the customer.
Online insurance comparison platforms have been implemented in a number of developed regions across the world and have shown to significantly enhance customer reach and experience. Save Your Monkey hopes to bring this globally commended service to Sri Lanka while enriching it with a number of other value-added products that are exclusively tailored for the Sri Lankan consumer. 
Saveyourmonkey.com is currently focusing on providing comparisons for vehicle and travel policies online. The brand also hopes to offer comparisons on a number of other insurances offline while migrating other general insurances, such as housing, on to the online platform in the near term. As part of the companys value-enhancing proposition, Save Your Monkey has partnered with a number of leading third party service providers in the country to pass on additional benefits to the end customer. Save Your Monkey believes collaboration to be an absolute key strategy, which is instilled deeply within the companys corporate culture. Being a young team, we have much to gain from leveraging in other competencies and services. Save Your Monkey believes in collaboration, thinking outside the box and structuring products that are not only innovative but also provide a unique value proposition that address the need of every consumer, said Save Your Monkey CFO and Director Dhanushka Liyanage.
He further stated that Save Your Monkey has been fortunate to partner and collaborate with top-tier service providers such as Laugfs Car Care, Autodrome and Uber, to provide these value additions to the companys clientele.
In addition to the comparison platform, the website saveyourmonkey.com also serves as a knowledge hub that addresses the most common concerns of insurance consumers in the country, allowing them to make well-informed decisions on their policies.
A second initiative that is expected to be launched by the company is the Save Your Monkey Roadside Assistance application that will give added assurance to customers by providing vital services during a time of crisis. This application, which will be a novel concept to Sri Lanka, will allow vehicle users to receive help when met with an accident or when faced with vehicle failure with a simple click of a button. Additionally, the company will also maintain an in-house call centre that the customers can access around the clock.
Along with their online platform, Save Your Monkey also provides services to the corporate sector via SYM insurance brokers.

Joint opposition MP Namal Rajapaksa said today he personally believed that imprisoning former army commander Sarath Fonseka should not have happened because he and his family members even conducted Bodi Poojas when he was injured in the bomb blast.
He said Mr. Fonseka was not dragged to the court by politically insulting him like what happens today.He was imprisoned through a legal procedure over allegations levelled against him, Namal said.
We did not take revenge by politically insulting him like what happens today. I personally believe it would have been better if it did not happen, he said.
When asked whether they regretted having taken such decisions during his fathers tenure, Namal said they never regretted taking political decisions and added that this government even regretted the killing of LTTE leader Prabhakaran.
He told the media after reporting to the Bribery commission today in connection with several complaints that the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) should record a statement from former president Chandrika Bandaranaike on the allegation that FCID officials obtained money from the Rajapaksas.
FCID should investigate how she came to know about it, Namal said.
He said those who made false allegations against the Rajapaksas during election time were accusing the officials who were conducting investigations because they have nothing to say when the allegations had proved baseless. (Ajith Siriwardana)

True story of a dark period
	
Veteran journalist Dharman Wickremaratne released a book in December detailing the JVPs second insurgency. This 880 page work of non-fiction is a testament to the terror that was rife during the period from 1986 to 1990, which ultimately claimed 60,000 lives. 
The book includes detailed facts and photographs on JVP leaders and activists, the JVPs role after its proscription in 1983, the events before and after the Indo-Lanka Accord, paramilitary groups and persons involved with them, trends of the Left movement in the 1980s, the SLFP, JVP attacks on the traditional Left, students struggles in schools, activities in the universities, academics and student leaders, military operations and other actions by insurgents and members of the clergy, lawyers, media personnel, artistes and others who were killed during the reign of terror. 


A summary of the insurgency provided by the US State Department reads as follows: 
In 1989, the JVP stepped up its campaign against the Government and population at large. Likened by some observers to Pol Pots Khmer Rouge and the Maoist Shining Path in Peru, the JVP sought to topple Sri Lankas elected Government through a campaign of murder, intimidation, and strikes designed to paralyse civil administration, cripple the economy and disrupt society. It did so despite repeated efforts by the Sri Lankan Government to bring the JVP into the political mainstream. In 1988, the Government had legalized the JVP and invited it to participate in the elections. The JVP responded by killing voters and candidates in an attempt to disrupt elections held in late 1988 and early 1989. In January 1989, in an effort to open a dialogue with the JVP, newly elected President Ranasinghe Premadasa released 1,800 JVP suspects and lifted the state of emergency. The JVP nonetheless continued its terror campaign of targeting hospitals, transportation, and other essential services, murdering union leaders who refused to participate in JVP-called strikes and killing the families of security force personnel. At mid-year, the Government began a massive crackdown on the JVP. It detained several thousand JVP suspects. By the end of the year, security forces had captured or killed many of the JVPs top leadership. 
The Daily Mirror was able to speak to Wickremaratne regarding his book Javipe devani karalla
Excerpts: 
How were you involved with the events 
During this time, I was working at a National Newspaper where I detailed many events of the insurrection. Through this position, I came into contact with many of the notable people that were involved in the events of that time. 
Could you explain the process of the book 
For the book, I used many of the articles, diaries, pictures and details which I had accumulated over the years and kept with me safely. After 30 years, I continued to explore and research the events that took place, in order to uncover more facts for the book. For this, I conducted 376 interviews with people associated with the insurgency. These included Rohana Wijeweeras daughter Chithrangani, members of the Central Committee, family members of the students and many others who were involved here and abroad. 
What was the nature of the casualties of the insurgency 
Between 1986 and 1990, the number of people that were killed or disappeared was 41,813. However, human rights groups report the number to be a much higher 67,652. The majority of these were residents of Hambantota and the district with the highest casualties was Galle. Out of the victims to die at the hands of the insurgents, the first was the Principal of Gonadeniya College, H. Jayawickrama. 
What are some of the key differences between the first and second insurgencies 
In the first insurgency, the Government killed close to 5000 insurgents, whereas during the second insurgency, a total number of 60,000 people were killed by both sides. In the second insurgency, by the latter half, all discipline and order had vanished and there was a situation of terror. Force was being used to win over the public. 
Why did you feel there was a need for a book of this nature 
It has been almost 30 years since these incidents occurred. Although numerous articles have been written about it, it is rarely that current publications including the true stories come out. There was a need to publish a book illustrating the events that those below the age of 40 today would have only heard about. This was therefore an attempt to fill the existing gaps. There maybe more stories however, that should be added into this work. Furthermore most of the leaders and activists of the second insurrection were killed, which means that the information they had was buried with them. This was not the case with the first insurgency, where there are many works detailing the events that unfolded. In addition, due to the nature of the conflict, many of those who live in Sri Lanka and abroad are unwilling to reveal what information they have. Therefore, I was in a well-placed position to gather this knowledge due to the nature of my relationships with many of them. Sinhala books that have been published on the insurgency revolve around personal stories, therefore this book is vastly different from those, since it details the accounts from an objective point of view. 
The book is the true story of a dark period which ended 27 years ago, memories of which will haunt all those who lived during that time and will stand testament to the Hobbesian definition of man which is solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short. 
The 880-page book contains 74 chapters and 1,289 photos and is priced at Rs. 1,500.

Two sets of twins are born on the SAME DAY
	

(Daily Mail, London), 19.02.2017 - 
At least they will never have a problem remembering each others birthdays. For sisters Erin, Leah, Charlotte and Isabelle Sullivan were all born on the same date. 
The two sets of twins - the elder girls are nine years old while the younger girls have just celebrated their first birthday - have defied odds of 4.5 million to one to arrive in the world on January 25. 
But despite the twins double-double of birthdays, the girls parents still face a struggle to organise everybodys parties and gifts - as they have five other children, and another one on the way. It was the start of 2016 when full-time mum Zoe was rushed to from the family home in Lossiemouth, Moray, to Raigmore hospital in Inverness for an emergency c-section. 
Tiny Erin and Leah were brought into the world on January 25 - exactly the same date that Charlotte and Isabelle were born in 2008.

US House of Representatives delegation in SL
	
A bipartisan delegation from the US House of Representatives arrived in Colombo today for three days of meetings as part of the House Democracy Partnership (HDP), the US Embassy today said. 
Issuing a statement, the Embassy said the delegation is pleased to continue the partnership begun with the signing of a Collaboration Agreement between the US House of Representatives and Sri Lankan Parliament on September 14, 2016 in Washington D.C. 
The visit serves to underscore the strong bipartisan support for Sri Lanka in the US Congress. 
This visit by our nations elected representatives in Congress shows that bipartisan support for strong US-Sri Lankan ties is robust across the branches of the US government, said US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Atul Keshap.
During the visit, the delegation is scheduled to meet the President, Prime Minister, Foreign Affairs Minister and Speaker. 
The delegation in Sri Lanka is led by HDP Chairman, Congressman Peter Roskam and includes Ranking Member Congressman David Price, Congressman Gerry Connolly and Congressman Adrian Smith.
The HDP is a bipartisan, twenty-member commission of the US House of Representatives that works directly with partner countries around the world to support the development of effective, independent, and responsive legislative institutions.

US senators consider sanctions against Iran for missile development
	

REUTERS, 19th FEBRUARY, 2017
U.S. Republican senators plan to introduce legislation to impose further sanction on Iran, accusing it of violating U.N. Security Council resolutions by testing ballistic missiles and acting to destabilize the Middle East, a U.S. senator said Sunday.
I think it is now time for the Congress to take Iran on directly in terms of what theyve done outside the nuclear programme, Senator Lindsey Graham, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told the Munich Security Conference.
Graham said he and other Republicans would introduce measures to hold Iran accountable for its actions.
Tensions between Tehran and Washington have risen since a Iranian ballistic missile test which prompted U.S. President Donald Trumps administration to impose sanctions on individuals and entities linked to the countrys Revolutionary Guards.
Iran is a bad actor in the greatest sense of the word when it comes to the region. To Iran, I say, if you want us to treat you differently then stop building missiles, test-firing them in defiance of U.N. resolution and writing Death to Israel on the missile. Thats a mixed message, Graham said.
Senator Christopher Murphy, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told the same panel there was nothing preventing Congress from imposing sanctions beyond those that were lifted as a result of the 2016 nuclear agreement with Iran.
