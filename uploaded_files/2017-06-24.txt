A response to Uditha Devapriya: Sinhala nationalism and  support for  Gotabaya
	
While I thank Uditha for his searching critique, and must express my hope and expectation that he may yet develop into a successor of Ajith Samaranayake, I must correct him on three factual issues:? ?
1. He writes that ?Like Dayan?s father, Malinda rejected the right-wing, elitist ethos of those institutions, and became a nationalist.?? ?
That is incorrect. Mervyn was an internationalist and a Third Worldist who was sympathetic to nationalism but never a nationalist. In that sense he was much closer to Godfrey Gunatilleke, Regi Siriwardena, Gamini Corea, Charles Abeysekara, Neville Jayaweera, Izzeth Hussein and A.J. Gunawardena than to Malinda?s father Gamini Seneviratne who was of course a contemporary and friend of his, and whose writings he enthusiastically published in the Lanka Guardian. Appropriately enough, it is Godfrey Gunatilleke, a ?golden lad? of that most intellectual of generations, who has analyzed Mervyn?s ideology and consciousness most definitively, and rightly defines him as committed to humanism and universalism; to a ?universalist humanism?.? ?
2. Uditha also writes: ? But there?s never just one kind of nationalism: there are nationalisms, so soon enough we saw Dayan and Malinda fighting via newspaper columns despite the fact that both were opposed to the government over its handling of the war?the ?intellectuals? were opposed to both since they were ?nationalists???? ?
Here too, the facts are the same as in or analogous to, the case of Mervyn de Silva and Gamini Seneviratne. Malinda was a militant Sinhala Buddhist nationalist, a member and electoral candidate of Champika?s JHU and a member of NMAT. Unlike Malinda, I have never been a nationalist nor am I one today, despite my alignment with, support for and sympathy with nationalists and nationalism. I am not ontologically a nationalist. My support for nationalism is neither unconditional nor unqualified. I am however, a patriot who is also an internationalist and a universalist. To put it provocatively, I admire Puran Appu and Jose Marti, but not Anagarika Dharmapala? because no sectarian ethno-religious particularism ever resonates with me.? ?
3. The third error that Uditha makes is to say that ?He [DJ] is also a moderate federalist?. It is because I come from the Marxist tradition that I have never been a federalist, moderate or otherwise. While I did support self-determination in my early twenties as a bookish Leninist, for 40 years since I have consistently been for equal rights as well as for devolution/regional autonomy. As the Chinese Constitution makes clear, it is perfectly possible and is often the case that those (especially those from a Leftist political culture) who are for regional autonomy are also staunch supporters of a unitary state?with regional autonomy/devolution.? ?
Obviously I must clarify and set to rest my stand on Gotabaya. He is to be sure a Sinhala Buddhist nationalist, which I am not, but that is not all Gotabaya is, just as it is not all that Mahinda Rajapaksa or Dinesh Gunawardena is. Furthermore there are times in history when Sinhala Buddhist nationalism is more reactionary than progressive, more negative than positive, but this is not one of those times. This is much more like 1956, 1970 and 2005. Finally, there are times in history when there is an option other than a Sinhala Buddhist nationalist leadership and ideology under which to fight a pro-imperialist puppet regime like the UNP but that time came and went in 1947-1953 and again in 1984-1988 (Vijaya Kumaratunga). They were historical exceptions. One hopes such a time comes again and with greater sustainability and success.? ?
Finally, to move from Uditha?s few factual inaccuracies to a single one of several partial misinterpretations. Vladimir Putin is an Orthodox Christian Russian nationalist, which is also what drives him and makes him take the stands he does. Like many throughout the world?states, social groups and individuals-- from China to Cuba, from Syria to Vietnam, I applaud and admire him neither because of his Orthodox Christian Russian nationalism nor despite it. We support him because he revived his country having rescued it from capitulation and disintegration under a Yahapalana type Yelstin regime, won a war and crushed a ghastly separatist terrorist militia in Chechnya (years before we won our war), and takes an active stand for national sovereignty and a multipolar world. In short people like me throughout the world support him not because of his subjective ideology but because of the objective role that Putin plays in a given historical context. So also it is with my support for Gotabaya.??

Cabinet decision on fate of SAITM next week
	
Cabinet will make several important decisions on the management of SAITM medical college when it meets on Tuesday, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne told Parliament yesterday.
Minister Senaratne who was speaking during an adjournment debate in the House said he would submit a paper on the private medical college in Malabe on Tuesday.
?The government will not allow a single party to own the SAITM Medical School. In addition a management mechanism will be introduced to the institution under which it will be run by experts in various fields such as marketing specialists, business management specialists and specialists in the field of medicine,? Dr. Senaratne said.
?The biggest issue with regard to the medical profession in Sri Lanka today is there is no specific standard to it. I have already embarked on introducing a standard for it and legislation is being prepared by the Legal Draftsman,? he added.
The Minister said several foreign universities including the Monash University and Manipal University might start up medical colleges in Sri Lanka in the future.
?One must move along with the changing world just like the socialist countries which had allowed private sector medical colleges. Come up with realistic criticism against the government instead just uttering things,? he told the members of the opposition benches.
Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardene said the government should not turn the other way at a time the SAITM had become a major issue. ?Nearly 8000 university students are carrying out a continuous Sathyagraha asking the government to nationalize SAITM. Even late President J R Jayewardene who is one of the most autocratic leaders in the country became flexible and nationalized the Ragama Private Medical College after realizing his mistake. Why can?t the present government do the same?? he questioned.
Responding to an allegation made by the MPs in the government benches that it was him who presented the gazette notification to set up SAITM in 2009, Mr Gunawardene said the gazette has been signed by S B Dissanayake who was the Minister of Higher Education at that time. ?SAITM is a brainchild of your minister? he told the members of the government side who was heckling him at that time".

China?s battle against poverty
	
China has worked in an astonishing manner during the last few decades to eradicate poverty. With this project they have managed to alleviate more than 800 Million people from poverty during the last thirty five years. ?
The main objective of this article is to find the modalities adopted by the Chinese Government to achieve this. In addition to improving traditional agriculture and industries which I have not discussed here they have implemented multi faceted programmes to make it successful. ?
In the alleviation of poverty the government recognizes the role education has to play. During the last several years the government has implemented several projects to uplift education. Free education has been introduced to rural areas, especially provinces where minorities live. Opening of new schools and development of existing schools was a part of this programme. The children of these poor schools were provided with free breakfast.
The state along with 13 other organizations have got together to make this project a success. In addition to this, the state provides incentives to teachers in remote areas to continue teaching in these areas.
?
"China aims to increase the number of village hotels nationwide to 3.4 M by 2020,"
One of the most important steps taken by the state is the vocational training given to students when they leave school. The emphasis of this education was industrial and connected to agriculture. The students of the western area who entered universities of other areas were given an education which will be much useful when they go back to their villages. Another remarkable step taken by the Chinese Government is the relocation of poor people in good areas. They successfully relocated 3.4 M people from poverty stricken areas to more developed areas.
The introduction of the Tourist Industry to remote areas is another method of increasing the income of rural people. The village areas of China are quite attractive and eco-friendly. These areas are full of fresh vegetables and fruits.The network of high speed trains that spread throughout the country also has helped the tourists to visit the rural areas of China. In some areas where small eating houses operate, they earn more than 200,000 Yuan per year. Today most of them shift from traditional farming to the modern service sector with much higher returns. More than 1.9 million such small hotels are found in rural areas today. In 2016 Tibet had 23 M visitors bringing in a gross income of 33 B Yuan. Over 100,000 herders and farmers were engaged in tourism services in 2016.? International hotel giants such as Hilton, Four seasons and Banyan Tree have entered China?s rural tourism market to grab a share of this lucrative business. Due to tourism over 10 M people have set themselves free from poverty during the last 5 years. China aims to increase the number of village hotels nationwide to 3.4 M by 2020, and also to lift 2M people out of poverty every year using rural tourism. Rural tourism can provide new business opportunities and help preserve beautiful scenery and push forward urbanization. ?
?Xi Jinping, the President of China, which has a population 1.4 B had stated that alleviating poverty is his top priority. China has taken great steps to alleviate poverty during the 13th five year plan 2016 ? 2020 under the leadership of Xi Jinping. ?
His ambition is to eradicate poverty by 2020. He has advised the government to maintain a neconomic growth of 6.5 % in the country, and to achieve that he plans to double the 2010 per capita income by 2020. He has advised the state officials to oversee that funds diverted towards the eradication of poverty are properly used for that purpose. Last year more than 19,000 people across the country were punished for corrupt practices related to the use of poverty alleviation funds, according to the Ministry of Finance. ?
The United Nations and the World Bank have commended the efforts taken by China to eradicate poverty. Mr. Bert Hofmann the Director of UN for China, Korea and Mongolia, has written a report to the global poverty reduction programme of UNO in 2016 and has vividly commended the poverty eradication programme of China. According to this report, world poverty has gone down by 70% due to Chinese actions.? Between 1978 and 2016 China has emancipated 800 M of its people from poverty.? It is believed by 2020 China will eradicate poverty and it will be a good example to other countries. ?

Vice President, Sri Lanka China Society.

FUTA condemns Govt. reaction to student protests
	
The Federation of University Teachers Associations (FUTA) yesterday urged the government to resolve the SAITM issue through a consultative rather than a confrontational process.
FUTA Secretary Prof. Arjuna Parakrama condemned the attack on the protesting university students and said the violent repression of legitimate protests must cease.
?Conflicts and differences of opinion should be resolved through informed discussions free from violence and intimidation. Continued indifference to this matter will only lead to unrest in the national university system,? he said.
Prof. Parakrama said the government must stand by its commitment to the right to protest and dissent. "We were led to believe that violent repression of legitimate dissent was a thing of the past, but it does not appear to be so," he said.
Prof. Parakrama said those responsible for ordering the excessive use of force on the students must be held accountable.
?The FUTA wants the crisis in higher education to be addressed on a priority basis and that the SAITM issue which is a symptomatic example of this crisis be resolved immediately,? he said.
Prof. Parakrama said the State medical faculty students had boycotted lectures for four months, and university student unions across the country, including the Inter University Students Federation (IUSF), had staged demonstrations, seeking a positive response from the government on the SAITM issue.
?FUTA does not condone the increasingly confrontational protests by students, but at the same time the gratuitously violent state response should be condemned in the strongest possible terms. These are university students and future leaders of this country,? he said.? (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Gammanpila was a spy in JHU: Warnasinghe
	
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary and MP Udaya Gammanpila acted as a spy for Mahinda Rajapaksa when he was a member of the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU), JHU National Organiser Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said yesterday.
Addressing a news conference held at the party head office, he said MP Gammanpila had continued to leak details of JHU meetings and decisions to former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Basil Rajapaksa.
?We knew Gammanpila was a mole when he was in the JHU. On several occasions, minutes of our meetings were found reported to the Rajapaksas as it was. Gammanpila clearly attempted to destroy the party,? Mr. Warnasinghe said.
However, he said Mr. Gammanpila in the meantime continuously tried to change the minds of the JHU members against the then president Rajapaksa and to get the party out from the United National Freedom Alliance (UPFA) Government.
?When he was a minister of the western provincial council, Gammanpila organised a two day seminar for JHU members in Kalutara and talked against the government. He wanted us to contest against the then government to which our General Secretary Patali Champika Ranawaka didn?t agree. However, most of our members eventually gave in to Gammanpila?s ideas,? Mr. Warnasinghe said.
He said Gammanpila spearheaded the JHU's defection from the Rajapaksa government and then back down and joined the government all by himself leaving the JHU. ?Gammanpila was generously awarded for his actions to please the then government,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Import of Prado vehicles: Govt. loses Rs.3,000 mln in taxes: COPA
	
The government has lost Rs.3,000 million by way of taxes in the importation of 407 Prado vehicles in 2016, the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) revealed in its report presented to Parliament yesterday.
The report presented by COPA Chairman Lasantha Alagiyawanna said tax revenue was lost because of the constant changes in the assessment process for the purpose of charging customs duty. However, Customs officers had said there were no losses incurred by the government and that an investigation was being carried out by a special presidential committee.
In addition the government has lost Rs 7.7 million by way of revenue because of the undervaluing of two BMW vehicles imported last year and investigations are being carried out on this matter as well, the report stated.
It was revealed that files on 597 registered motor vehicles at the Department of Motor Traffic have been misplaced and that COPA would complain to the President and the Prime Minister on this matter if there was no positive outcome.
The report had also focused on the progress made in the exploration and recovery of oil and gas in the Mannar Basin said to have the potential to recover five billion barrels of oil and nine trillion cubic feet of natural gas. COPA had stressed the need to move the project to the development stage from the exploration stage.
COPA has also called for a report from the Department of Coast Conservation Coastal Resource Management on the steps taken to minimize sea erosion caused by the Port City Project. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Kingswood College, Kandy A school ?par excellence?
	
Kingswood steps into one hundred and twenty six years in a turbulent storm within one of the oldest Unions of Old Boys over an Annual General Meeting. But the prize -giving of the school would be held today with an Old Boy as the Chief Guest. The normal practice of an old Boy as the Guest of the Week would not be there while the Provincial Director is the Guest of Honour. Are these changes for the good of the school founded by a journalist and historian.? ?
There is no parallel anywhere in the world that a journalist had founded an educational Institution and has lasted for one hundred and twenty five years. But, Kingswood College Kandy founded by a journalist Louis Edmund Blaze has withstood the currents of time. He was the Editor of ?Ceylon Independent? and built a public school for the children of the country. He also became a Historian. ?
There seems to be nothing wrong when the Union of Old Boys goes before Courts, as Kingswood has a vibrant group of students who pass out of its portals. But, the fate remains. The Annual General Meeting is now in abeyance.? ?
?Kingswood? was the first school to be handed over when schools were taken over by the State. It was also a decision by the Wesleyan Mission. The school proudly presents the three gates, one imported from the United Kingdom, one from South Africa and the other from England. But, unfortunately a Principal, removed this unique blessed gate to the area of the lower school and a new gate was constructed for the Mahapola exhibition, in order to take a heavy truck. But, ?Mahapola? never materialized and disfigured the school entrance.? ?
?
?
Kingswood was known as ?Blaze School? founded in 1891 with twelve students, based on the foundations of public schools in England. Blaze was Sri Lankan, but was an Indian graduate from an Indian University, having his basics at Trinity College, Kandy. Kingswood was founded as ?Kandy Boys? High School? with a sister school as ? Kandy Girls? High School?. Both were Methodist Mission schools. ?
On fourth May 1891, Kingswood saw the light of day as ?The Kandy Boys? High School? and later changed the name to ?Kingswood College? in 1898. ?
There are many firsts at Kingswood woven for the benefit of the country, not only for the? school. Traffic Units were born at Kingswood College when a senior prefect Sanaraja Banda Senaratne mooted the idea for a school traffic unit way back in the nineteen fiftys.? Kingswood commenced rugby and gave up after a player died after an attack of a kick. It was the first school to recruit woman teachers such as Miss Annie Bartholomeuz to a boys? school. The first to introduce school bands. The first to send a delegate Francis Rajapakse, to a World jamboree in Paris, and the only delegate to represent Sri Lanka at the Centenary Congress of the Red Cross. These are only a few of the many firsts... ?
The blessings of Blaze was that any child who passes out of the portals of Kingswood could live up to its standards and also fit into any society, high or low. There was no supremacy and everyone was equal, humble and disciplined. Blaze instilled this concept to the pupils at a very early age, so much so that when the Tulba family of Egyptians were exiled from Egypt and lived in Sri Lanka, they opted for Kingswood for their children?s future rather than ?forcing? them into other recognised school?s in Colombo. ?
The 156th birth anniversary of the founder falls on 29th September, born in 1861. ?
Blaze forsook an appointment offered by Professor Mars to be the Editor of the one time Journal ?Ceylon Independent? for a short-lived journalistic career. He was also an author of Ceylon History. ?
?
	The 156th birth anniversary of the founder falls on 29th September, born in 1861
	
	
	Kingswood? was the first school to be handed over when schools were taken over by the State
	
	
	Kingswood is the only school that has prologues recited
	
?
Blaze took to journalism at the age of 15 when he was a student of Trinity College and became the founder editor of the fortnightly school magazine, the ?Gleaner ? which he commenced on 15th May 1876.?? He commenced the classes with eleven pupils at No. 11, Pavilion Street, Kandy which is now Deva Veediya and houses an Attorneys? office.? When the school was at Pavilion Street, the? Courts was in close proximity and a number of incidents had occurred during this period. One suchstory is when a boy saw a ?cock? walking on the narrow pavement of Pavilion Street. Out came the catapult and the cock rolled on the ground and lay still. Right behind the boy was the ?Arm of the Law? and the boy was taken to the Court, which was close by, now the International Cultural Centre. The Magistrate then was firm and also human. He asked, ?Where is the cock?? The policeman could not touch the cock, because the cock stood up shook his feathers and walked away, among the laughter of the the legal fraternity and the Magistrate. That was life then. ?
The first prize giving of Kingswood was held in 1895 at the Kandy Town Hall which continued to be the venue till 1904 after which it was moved into Kandy Girls? High School Hall and back to the Town Hall. ?
?
"There was no supremacy and everyone was equal, humble and disciplined. Blaze instilled this concept to the pupils at a very early age, so much so that when the Tulba family of Egyptians were exiled from Egypt and lived in Sri Lanka, they opted for Kingswood for their children?s future rather than ?forcing? them into other recognised school?s in Colombo. "
?
The first Chief Guest was F. Dornorst and the unique prologue was read by E.G. Jonklass. The privileged student to read the prologue was the winner of the oratory prize of the school, then and even now. Kingswood seldom invites politicians to be their Chief Guest, unless he is the Head of State. ?
Kingswood is the only school that has prologues recited and this tradition was borrowed from Harrow of England, where prize day poems were recited. In the words of Blaze, the object of the prologue was to get rid of the restlessness that is created during Prize Day in any school. In fact it was a diversion. ?
Blaze was the first graduate to obtain the B.A.Degree from the University of Calcutta, as student from Trinity College. Then he taught at the Boys? School of Lahore for a short time after graduation. Blaze?s grandfather Hendrik Carl Blaze was a highly placed person in the United Kingdom. He arrived in Sri Lanka as the third mate on board the ship ?Amphitribe?. He had three children including Henry Blaze, who was the father of of Louis Edmund Blaze. The Wesleyan Methodist Conference in England appointed Henry Blaze as a teacher to the Methodist Mission school at Bentota in 1821. ?
Henry Blaze then became the Headmaster of the Government Boys? School, Payagala in 1826 and married a school teacher Margaret Caroline de Joodt in the same year. ?
A brief caning incident at Kingswood shows Blaze the educationist par excellence at work. It is recorded that when a boy had to be caned, he asked one of the boys to bring a cane and one who volunteered and jumped forward to bring the cane was the one who was caned by Blaze. The reason attributed by Blaze was that the boy who jumped to bring the cane was very eager to see one of his colleagues being punished. This he used to say was not the spirit of Kingswood. ?
Kingswood had no science teachers and the Wesleyan Mission ?imported?? them from India. Most of them did not return . They were involved with the spirit of Kingswood and their contribution spelt beyond the school walls. ?
Kingswood was lucky enough to obtain a spacious land to build the school in the present premises at Peradeniya Road. The gift was by a man who never set his foot on Kingswood soil nor did he see what was happening at the new education Institution.?? Sir John Randles the benefactor in England was looking for a school to which he could give 10,000 sterling pounds. The Wesleyan Mission selected Kingswood, which by this time was firmly built by its founder.

LG election by September?
	
Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha has assured to hold the local government (LG) elections by September this year, Joint Opposition Convener and MP Prasanna Ranatunga said yesterday.
A group of JO MPs, LG members and provincial councilors led by MP Ranatunga met Minister Musthapha at his Ministry in Colombo yesterday.
The JO group along with supporters staged a protest outside the Ministry prior to the meeting with the Minister.
MP Ranatunga said the Minister seemed interested in holding the election but it was the government which is postponing the election.
?If the government fails to hold the election by September as assured by the Minister, we will bring in people in large numbers to Colombo and urge the government to hold the elections. The government is afraid that Mahinda Rajapaksa will win the election. That?s why it keeps postponing polls,? he told journalists outside the ministry.
He also said lack of people?s representatives at LG bodies had made an impact on services of them such as garbage collecting, eradicating dengue and providing other facilities. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Mob beats Deputy Superintendent of Police to death in Indian Kashmir
	
?
An angry mob beat a police officer to death outside a mosque in Indian-administered Kashmir, police said Friday, as tensions ran high in the volatile Himalayan region. ?
Witnesses said the mob attacked Mohammad Ayub Pandith late Thursday after he fired his pistol when confronted by worshipers at the mosque in the main city of Srinagar who suspected him of being a government spy.A police statement said Pandith, a deputy superintendent with the security wing of the state police, had been ?attacked and beaten to death by a mob?. ??
He ?sacrificed his life in the line of duty,? the statement said. ?
Witnesses said worshippers confronted Pandith, who was not wearing a uniform, as he took pictures with his mobile phone outside the Jamia (Grand) Mosque in Srinagar during the festival of Lailat-ul-Qadr, when Muslims hold late-night prayers. ?
He drew out his pistol and fired, injuring three, as his colleague fled the scene, they said. ?

NFTH will be a dengue treatment centre: Kiriella
	
House Leader and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella said yesterday the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH) would be taken over by the government and turned it into a dengue treatment centre.
Speaking at the debate on the attack on the protesting university students and the GMOA strike, he thanked Dinesh Gunawardane for giving legal cover to SAITM through a Gazette notice.
He said three judges and 15 attorneys had in court accepted the fact that SAITM had the legal right to function.
The minister said the university students had stormed the health ministry on Wednesday in an attempt to influence the SAITM case which was being taken up for hearing in the Supreme Court that day and added that their unruly and rowdy behaviour would boomerang on them.
He said it was the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime which permitted the launching of SAITM and added that former president Mahinda Rajapaksa had even given it a grant of Rs.600 million.
The minister said it was the government which should decide on the educational policy of the country and not the university students or the GMOA which was only a trade union.
He said only the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) had the authority to decide on the standard of medical education in the country and added that the GMOA strike was an utter failure and the people would respond to it if they continued the work stoppage . (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

He told parliament that the finance minister should be the subject minister of the lotteries board according to its Act and added that the government had not amended the Act to authorize the foreign minister to handle the activities of the lotteries board.
He said the assigning of the lotteries board to the foreign ministry had violated the Lotteries Board Act and added that the President or the Prime Minister should correct the blunder. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
