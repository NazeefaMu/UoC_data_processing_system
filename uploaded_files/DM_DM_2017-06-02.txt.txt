A man for all seasons
	
Ivan Samarawickrema
Ivan died in his sleep at the age of 95 a couple of days ago. He was buried that very day, according to his wishes, by his sons, Anil, Malik and Lalin. His wife Nellie died a decade ago. In his day, Ivan was one of the best known and best loved public figures in the country. He was a public servant, as understood by that description in the English language, in the context of the recent history of Ceylon / Sri Lanka.
He had very clear-cut chiselled features and moved about with grace. In his University College days he was a quarter miler (400 metres, which was a test of both speed and stamina) and held the Ceylon national record for that athletic distance
Why and how do I write about Ivan I worked with him and was his close friend. This friendship began when I joined the Land Commissioners Department in 1960 as a District Land Officer (DLO). Ivan was the Senior DLO, then working in Kandy at the Kachcheri, assisting the Government Agent in managing Crown land and its occupants. Crown land, since land was the primary factor of production, was the most valuable physical asset of the government and District Land Officers, who were a special category of administrators specialised in this field, though the titular OIC was the Government Agent, the pillar on which the colonial and post colonial structure rested. To become a DLO was a great and gratifying, fulfilling experience, giving you authority over land and people and filling you with the sense of the real. The real consisted of working with farmers, both landless peasants and middle class, who were the salt of the earth in Ceylon / Sri Lanka up till 1977, when the change brought about by the open economy also changed the world views of both officials and the public. 
By 1977 however Ivan had become a Commanding Officer in the army volunteer force and a Government Agent. He was the first non CCS guy to become an AGA, which was done by stepping into the line of succession headed by Leonard Woolf, who became AGA Jaffna in the first decade of the 1900s. Ivan had the bearing and figure of an army officer combined with the gravitas of a learned man.
He had very clear-cut chiselled features and moved about with grace. In his University College days he was a quarter miler (400 metres, which was a test of both speed and stamina) and held the Ceylon national record for that athletic distance. When he wrote a report on a land matter it had the air of a well made, elegant essay focused on real world issues and a persuasive proposal for action. They were models of scholarly judgement and technical writing, with a practical purpose.

Because of his army status and his academic and administrative skills, he rose in the estimation of politicians, of fellow bureaucrats and of those who knew him as an acquaintance, as a man of both credit and renown, and of outstanding judgement and ability in practical matters. He was the first Controller of Prices and Warden of Standards, when that position was resurrected from the rubbish bin of war time devices, to deal with the economic crisis of the 1970s, when Ms. Bandaranaike was Prime Minister and T.B. Illangaratne was Minister of Trade. I was his first deputy. We enjoyed working together in the same manner as we did when he was Government Agent, Polonnaruwa and I was his Senior District Land Officer. Of course, Polonnaruwa, at the time of Minister C.P. de Silva was all land work. C.P. de Silva sometimes treated officers with scant respect, himself having been one before he became a politician. One of his memorable comments was about another particularly enthusiastic official (NOT Ivan), who didnt exactly tow the line, but seemed to have some ulterior motive. I am building a road to the expanding cultivation area. He is building a road to Nirvana. But Ivan bore himself with sufficient self respect and bearing to neutralize those attitudes. Working in Polonnaruwa was exciting and fruitful. 
Ivan went on to become the Secretary of the Mahaveli Ministry and was for sometime the Commercial Counsellor in Bonn, after having held the position of Director of Commerce. Because of his wide experience and standing, Ivan was later a consultant to the Cabinet in economic affairs. 
A narrative of his work in the government does not convey at all the kind of man he was. He was respected as well as loved by those who knew him for his personal qualities of goodness, as a private individual, and as a public figure. To combine such a mix was not easy.

May he rest in peace.

He was too full of the milk of human kindness
	
Prof. Siri Gunasingha
Prof. Siri Gunasingha was aptly appreciated by people including the Prime Minister because of his eruditeness, creativity, innovation and uniqueness. Although I have been an ardent admirer of this great personality, it is not my intention to concentrate on his great works, be it in the form of prose, verse or visual or performing art. Rather I would like to focus my attention on the great human being who lived in Prof. Gunasingha. 
Thanks to Prof. Sunanda Mahendra, Prof. Somaratne Balasuriya and Mr. Jayasumana Dissanayake I had the rare privilege of meeting with Prof. Gunasingha. At the first meeting with Prof Gunasingha, I would have been the only lay person among the gathering, all the others being celebrities in the literary field. But Prof. Gunasingha never showed less mercy to me, instead treated me as one of his friends. 
In the course of time, thanks to Mr.Jayasumana Dissanayake, I managed to see him whenever he came to Sri Lanka. I had the privilege of meeting with him at his brothers residence in Etul Kotte. There were instances in such meetings, when while we were talking, there were some calls on his brothers land phone which yearned for his interaction for long times. Sometimes I feared that I was embarrassing him by being there to overhear the delicate, pleasant (one way) conversation alluding to nostalgic memories. But he was a poet and was the least embarrassed and such conversations were well enjoyed by him as I noticed him finishing the call with the same enthusiasm, warmth and love as when he started answering the call. 
One evening we were at a restaurant somewhere close to the Diyawanna Oya and when we were about to leave the place I suddenly became unconscious. Later on, around nine p.m, when I opened my eyes I was in my bed. I wondered how it happened and I found myself in my evening clothes as I was in the restaurant. When I asked my wife how it happened, she told me that two gentlemen had brought me home. She described the two gentlemen, and as both had striking personalities with unforgettable features, the entire story was unfolded to me. To my surprise my old car was in my garage. Then I could imagine what had happened. My god! They must be waiting for a bus in this dark night on a bus route where there were no buses after 7pm. I drove my car as fast as possible and I found them waiting at the bus halt! Having noticed a car stopped near them they would have thought that a person who had recognized them would have stopped the car to offer them a lift. They recognized me and refused to get boarded. After much coaxing, I managed to convince them that I was fit to drive, after which they agreed to accept the offer. By the time we reached the restaurant, all the other vehicles except Mr. Jayasumana Dissanayakes brand new car had left. While getting down from my humble car Prof. Gunasingha bade me good night. That was the last word I heard from him. 
Good night, Dear Sir!

## Title: In search of a Sri Lankan cultural modernity

In search of a Sri Lankan cultural modernity
	
The death of Siri Gunasinghe last week left the nations cultural establishment numbed. And not for nothing: Professor Gunasinghe, who among other things was one of only two novelists here who directed a movie (and a landmark one at that), was the last of the bilingual literati that made the waves here and overseas. Everyone else who followed him were politically and philosophically of a different breed, the sole exception (at least to an extent) being Gunadasa Amarasekera.
The truth is that modernity is not incongruent with nationalism. The truth is that modernity can and does subsist on tradition
Gunasinghes death, a personal tragedy as it is, interests me more for what it means to our cultural establishment, the same establishment which has tried so hard to chart a kind of modernity that was not uprooted. That is has failed, and that its failure has to do largely with the culture of inferiority which has gripped our people since 1956, leaves no room for doubt. 
At the cost of simplifying an already simplified situation, I will hence say this: politically, socially, and philosophically, our country has imbibed a potent form of anti-intellectualism. We are so confused as to why this anti-intellectualism has come about, moreover, that we rationalise it in terms of the nationalist/anti-nationalist dichotomy which provides an easy point for the political commentator. The truth is that modernity is not incongruent with nationalism. The truth is that modernity can and does subsist on tradition. To understand how this simple point has evaded our notice, its apt to look back at 1956 and what transpired subsequently. 
Political movements never really end. They can only be stopped, and that at the cost of stalling an otherwise gradual social process. 1956, on that count, was less a movement than an experiment, which signalled (ironically) the upheaval of the anglicised elite through the leadership of a scion of that same elite. I remember reading in one of those travel books (by Discovery) on Sri Lanka that the 1956 election passed power from the legatees of colonialism to an indigenous leader. That is patently false. Power was passed, yes, but only from one shade of Westernisation to another. As subsequent elections showed, it was basically a social transformation effected by the grassroots but denied by the self-contradictions of its own leadership.
1956, on that count, was less a movement than an experiment, which signalled (ironically) the upheaval of the anglicised elite through the leadership of a scion of that same elite
S. W. R. D. Bandaranaikes programme, as I mentioned in this column last week, derived for the most from two sources: Western liberalism and the Bengali Renaissance. The former, critics and commentators have explored. The latter, to a considerable extent at least, they have not. A tragedy at one level, primarily because we tend to forget that in trying to emulate the Tagorean experiment of fusing modernity and tradition, Bandaranaikes own personality denied the validity of such a fusion for anything other than our cultural sphere. This latter point merits further discussion. 
Amartya Sen, in an article written to the New Republic six years ago, contended that Tagore, far from being the romantic traditionalist he is touted as today, was actually a modernist railing against the social order of his day. He was at odds with Gandhi, whose idealisation of the spinning wheel or chakra as a symbol of a return to the past he critiqued as lacking judgment and energy (The chakra does not require anyone to think). Despite his enthusiasm for Gandhis political campaign, consequently, he was doubtful about Gandhis social persona, filled as it was with repulsion towards Western civilization. In this, however, Tagore was no imitator, no rootless cosmopolitan who idealised that same Western civilization he championed with regard to the progress it attained in the realms of science, literature, and political philosophy. 
That kind of fearless, revolutionary thinking seems to be lacking in our modernists of today. Sadly. In the fifties and sixties, a Siri Gunasinghe or a Lester James Peries could critique the conventional wisdom by carving a different path, one that brought together tradition and modernity. It happened in Tagores land of birth as well: Satyajit Ray was his intellectual and artistic heir, and to an extent at least he was responsible for prolonging the Bengali Renaissance from Tagores death to the end of the 20th century. In comparison, the modernists of today are a horde of gandabba commentators, either rubbishing the same roots which sustained them or condemning those roots to the dustbin of history.

Added to that was another, more potent problem: unlike in Bengal and even India (also nurtured by a Renaissance), the cultural revolution which 1956 wrought was first affirmed and then denied by its political leadership. 1956 in that respect could not have happened were it not for three figures: Professor Sarachchandra, Lester James Peries, and Martin Wickramasinghe. All three were well versed in Western modernity, while Sarachchandra and Wickramasinghe were equally versed in the national ethos (Peries upbringing denied him that ethos until later on). 
He was at odds with Gandhi, whose idealisation of the spinning wheel or chakra as a symbol of a return to the past he critiqued as lacking judgment and energy (The chakra does not require anyone to think).
The political pamphleteers behind Sinhala Only, on the other hand, were less interested in that kind of fusion than in an irrationally radical chauvinism which, ironically, gave birth to the same political figures who would deny any place to that chauvinism later on. In other words, it is in 1956 that we see the basis for the later and equally narrow-minded demands for separatism and federalism, not to mention the present day anti-unitary campaigns of the TNA. 
Plainly put, what happened that year was a bifurcation of our intelligentsia into the indigenous and the uprooted. It gave a set of false channels for the underprivileged to vent out their collective rage, which in the end left class structures intact and empowered the uprooted elite while giving the impression that they were placed on the same pedestal as that of the indigenous. The lack of any congruence between the cultural and the political in the revolution wrought that year facilitated that: the same revolution which helped the likes of Siri Gunasinghe would deny bilingualism its due place and hypocritically demean English (in the political sphere) while fermenting a culture of envy among those who could not wield it. The most immediate result of this, obviously, was the absenting of an educated bilingual intelligentsia. 
That is why (and I am going back to my earlier point) I say that we are seeing a horrendous form of anti-intellectualism. Here. Today. Those who are unable to wield the language of access, English, repudiate their roots to join the English-speaking intelligentsia. Those who are able to, and by dint of that ability are members of that intelligentsia, sustain the myth that there are no indigenous intellectuals, and that to become an intellectual, one must deny ones cultural sensibilities. Small wonder, then, that anti-intellectualism is on the rise. Without a modernity that takes over from the past, only an aberration in the form of a gandabba, neither-here-nor-there people and nation can result. Anti-intellectualism thrives on just that. 
And you know what We dont seem to be worried. Not by a long shot.

37 killed as gunman storms Manila hotel
	
At least 37 people have been killed after a 'white, English-speaking' gunman attacked a casino in Manila, stole 1.7million in betting chips and set fire to tables before burning himself to death.
It is understood many of the victims were women who suffocated due to smoke inhalation as crowds battled to get to the exits.
Witnesses said the gunman, who had an assault rifle, entered the Resorts World Manila casino in Pasay City, Philippines, shortly after midnight before opening fire on betting terminals and televisions.
It sparked mass panic and the man was then seen pouring fuel over tables and setting them ablaze while gamblers were fleeing for their lives.
Explosions were also heard coming from the tourist hotpot and bloodied victims were seen being stretchered out of the building. (Daily Mail)

Malaysia Airlines attack: Lankan fails to appear in court
	
The 25-year-old Sri Lankan who was accused of threatening to blow up a Malaysia Airlines flight en route to Kuala Lumpur has failed to appear in court as he felt unsafe, International Business Times reported today quoting the lawyer of the accused.
Manodh Marks, a Sri Lankan living in Australia on a student visa, has been charged at the Magistrates Court in Melbourne with endangering the safety of an aircraft and making false threats. Both charges carry a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment.
The MH128 flight carrying over 330 passengers was forced to turn back to Melbourne just a few minutes after it took off when Marks tried to enter the cockpit. He had also threatened passengers with a device, claiming it to be explosives.
It was initially thought that Marks was carrying explosives, and the police had termed the incident on the plane as an act of terrorism. However, it was later revealed that Marks was just carrying a "speaker-type" object, authorities said.
Marks had been in custody but his lawyer has said he felt "vulnerable" in detention and asked for medical help.
"He has concerns for his safety in custody. He needs to see a mental health nurse urgently," his lawyer Tess Dunsford said after being questioned by Magistrate Susie Cameron over the reason for his helplessness.
Marks has a history of psychiatric illness and had just been released from a psychiatric facility, before he boarded the flight, police said.
No bail request has been filed on Mark's behalf. The matter has been listed for a committal hearing on 24 August.
Meanwhile, authorities handling the case were facing pressure with questions being raised about the time it took to arrest Marks after the plane landed at Melbourne airport.
Armed policemen kept passengers and crew members waiting for 90 minutes before they helped them deboard.
Victoria Police chief commissioner Graham Ashton said police had initially thought it was a terrorism incident and tried to handle it accordingly, before deciding it was "a case involving a mental health issue".
"I certainly appreciate when you are on a plane in that situation one minute could seem like an hour. The objective in any serious incident like this is to get every member of the crew, every passenger off the plane safely, and that is what was able to be achieved," he added.

Massive blast in the heart of Kabuls diplomatic quarter kills scores
	

By Sayed Salahuddin, Pamela Constable 
A massive blast tore through the diplomatic quarter of the Afghan capital Wednesday, killing at least 80 people and wounding more than 460, officials said. The devastation left Kabul in shock and underlined the countrys security struggles as it confronts a sustained wave of insurgent and terrorist attacks. 
Interior Ministry officials said a huge quantity of explosives, hidden in a tanker truck, detonated at 8:30 a.m. during rush hour on a busy boulevard in the Wazir Akbar Khan district, which houses embassies, banks, supermarkets and government ministries. An entire city block was ravaged, with office buildings left in rubble and charred vehicles strewn across the road in one of the deadliest single attacks in Kabul. 
The scenes of human horror were appalling, even for a country accustomed to war and violence.  At Wazir Akbar Khan Hospital, a steady stream of ambulances and police trucks delivered burned and mangled bodies, many streaming blood. Medical aides struggled to zip them quickly into body bags as distraught people crowded around, looking for missing relatives. 
The dead and wounded were almost all Afghan civilians and security forces: police officers, bank clerks, cart pullers, telephone company workers. The dead included at least five women, an Afghan driver for the BBC and at least nine Afghan guards stationed at points outside the U.S. Embassy. 
The Afghan Taliban denied any role in the bombing, which was followed by a second, smaller blast in another part of the city.

The train was flagged off during Modis visit to Sri Lanka on March 14, 2015. The advertisement is made on the fast development of railways and six metro cities with the metro facility.
It is clearly written on the right bottom corner Thalimannar pear, to which PM Modi is seen giving the green signal.
The advertisement is in Sinhala, Tamil and English. Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena is also seen in the picture.
The article said critics have made allegations that the Sri Lankan picture was used only because there was no significant achievement in the Indian railway sector.

Putin threatens to build up forces in response to US anti-missile system
	
St. Petersberg, (Daily Mail, London), 1 June 2017 - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that elements of a US anti-missile system being built in Alaska and South Korea were a challenge to Russia which it was obliged to respond to by building up its own forces in the region. 
Putin, speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an economic forum in St Petersburg, said Russia could not stand idly by and watch while others increased their military capabilities along its borders in Europe and the Far East. 
Earlier in the day, Putin said he hoped Russophobia in the West would not last for too long, not forever, if only because the understanding has to come that it is counterproductive and harms everyone. 
He insisted that measures against Moscow, including economic sanctions, had ended up having zero effect.

Science of numbers
	

Mystic influence of numbers
Numerology, however, is not a pure science like Arithmetic or Mathematics. It is a branch of occult learning allied to Astrology. Numbers in Numerology are not a tool for calculating time, velocity, quantity or extent, but for predicting what is unforeseen in the life of an individual or a nation. Numerology also can be described as an occult science that deals with the mystic influence of numbers on man, collectively and individually.

Science of Periodicity
Numerologists describe Numerology as the science of periodicity and they depend much on the theory of periodicity to predict future events. In fact, the occurrence of all phenomena is in accord with a certain order of regularity or periodicity.
The earth takes 365 days, 6 hours and 9 minutes and 9.7 seconds to complete one orbit round the Sun. The length of the Lunar month is 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes and 2.9 seconds.
The law of periodicity true to heavenly events is applicable to human beings as well. For example, women experience a 28-day menstrual circle. The period of gestation is about 280 days.

Man subject to universal laws
Man is part of the universe. Therefore, he too is subject to universal laws and the law of periodicity is one of them.
There is no doubt that the advancement of modern science has helped shed light on many a secret about life and the universe.
Numerology attempts to identify natural patterns that hold the key to a world of mysteries surrounding human life hitherto unravelled by science.
Unknown elements have to be discovered on the basis of known elements. In a way, it is as simple as determining what the 3rd angle of a triangle is if the other two angles are already known.

Science of numbers in ancient civilizations
The science of numbers is not something of recent origin. Even in ancient civilizations, sages have identified numbers with forces influencing man and his environment.

Practising the science of numbers for good luck
Hindus, heirs to a great ancient civilization even today practise the science of numbers in their day-to-day life. For example, the following square board marked with numbers in sub squares is placed at the entrance to shops owned by Hindus.
When you add up the numbers along whichever line horizontal, vertical or diagonal, the result you get is 15. They believe this square board with this pattern of numbers brings them good luck. Their experience has proved the efficacy of this square in bringing good luck.

The Mount of Saturn
	
Human Hand  Trailblazer of human civilization  Part 10

In the previous article, we discussed the 12 Mounts on the palm in general and the Mount of Jupiter in particular.
Location onthe palm
The Mount of Saturn which we discuss today is located at the base of the second finger  the Finger of Saturn.
Experts of the science of Chiromancy (Palmistry) say that the more elevated the Mount of Saturn and the larger and longer is the finger; the more clearly pronounced is the subject or the owner.
A depression on the Mount
A highly developed Mount of Saturn is seldom found in the majority of hands. On most hands, there is a depression in the area marked as the Mount of Saturn. This depression is caused by the Line of Fate or the Line of Saturn running towards the root of the Finger of Saturn bisecting the area of the Mount and making it (the Mount) lean mostly towards the Mount of Mercury.

Character of a Saturnian
If the Mount of Saturn is fully developed, the owner is very fortunate and he would rise to a high position by the dint of perseverance. Such persons become so absorbed in work aimed at gaining the goals in life, they would almost neglect their domestic obligations. They would remain aloof even from those dear and near to them.
Persons with a prominent Mount of Saturn very often would achieve success in life as engineers, scientists, poets, journalists, authors and chemists. They are suspicious by nature and due to this trait, they would have misunderstandings even with wife and children.
If there are too many lines on the Mount of Saturn, the owner is a coward and he is licentious.
Chirognomy (Character as shown by the hands in general) experts describe a person with a prominent Finger of Saturn and an equally prominent Mount of Saturn as a Saturnian.
Renowned Chirognomist known by his pseudonym Psycho says; Generally speaking a Saturnian may be recognized by the straight upright Finger of Saturn and the other fingers leaning towards it
He is a peculiar person always fastidious, prudent and wise. He is the tallest of the types and the representative finger is the largest on the hand. Gaunt, thin and pale, the skin is yellow and wrinkled. His hair is dark; the face is lean and thin...
A combination of a prominent Mount of Saturn and a prominent Mount of Jupiter confers the owner with patience and respect from society.

Trump administration may return Russian compounds
	

BY Karen Deyoung, Adam Entous 
The Trump administration is moving toward handing back to Russia two diplomatic compounds, near New York City and on Marylands Eastern Shore, from which its officials were ejected in
late December. 
Then-President Barack Obama said Dec. 29 that the compounds were being used by Russian personnel for intelligence-related purposes, and gave Russia 24 hours to vacate them. 
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak at a meeting in Washington, that the United States had dropped any linkage between the compounds and the consulate, according to several people with knowledge of the exchanges.

Trump will withdraw US from Paris climate agreement
	
 President Trump announced on Thursday that the United States would withdraw from the Paris climate accord, weakening efforts to combat global warming and embracing isolationist voices in his White House who argued that the agreement was a pernicious threat to the economy and American sovereignty.
In a speech from the Rose Garden, Mr. Trump said the landmark 2015 pact imposed wildly unfair environmental standards on American businesses and workers. He vowed to stand with the people of the United States against what he called a draconian international deal.
I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris, the president said, drawing support from members of his Republican Party but widespread condemnation from political leaders, business executives and environmentalists around the globe.
Mr. Trumps decision to abandon the agreement for environmental action signed by 195 nations is a remarkable rebuke to heads of state, climate activists, corporate executives and members of the presidents own staff, who all failed to change his mind with an intense, last-minute lobbying blitz. The Paris agreement was intended to bind the world community into battling rising temperatures in concert, and the departure of the Earths second-largest polluter is a major blow.
Mr. Trump said he wanted to negotiate a better deal for the United States, and the administration said he had placed calls to the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Canada to personally explain his decision. A statement from the White House press secretary said the president reassured the leaders that America remains committed to the trans-Atlantic alliance and to robust efforts to protect the environment.
But within minutes of the presidents remarks, the leaders of France, Germany and Italy issued a joint statement saying that the Paris climate accord was irreversible and could not be renegotiated. (nytimes)
