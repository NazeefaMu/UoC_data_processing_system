Foreign currency smugglers caught at BIA
	
Two Lankan men were today arrested at the Katunayake airport by the Customs Narcotics Division with foreign currency amounting to around Rs.35 million while they were attempting to smuggle them out to Singapore.
Katunayake Airport Deputy Customs Director Parakrama Basnayake said the suspects from Colombo were aged between 35 and 49.
The suspects were arrested at 1.10 this morning after their behaviour was found to be suspicious. During investigations the currency was found concealed inside clay ornaments packed in their luggage, he said.
Among the foreign currency were Saudi Riyals, Swiss Francs and Euros, Mr. Basnayaka said.
The raid was conducted under the direction of customs director J.R. Uduwawala and Deputy Customs Director Parakrama Basnayake while investigations are being carried out by the Assistant Customs Superintendents Nuwan Abeynayaka, Hasantha Guruge, Udaya Gamini and Samantha Kaluaggala.(Chaturanga Pradeep and Ranjith Ferdinandus)

Govt. to launch Hanuman Bridge project: Gammanpila
	
The Sri Lankan government is involved in secret mission to launch the Hanuma Bridge project connecting Sri Lanka and India under the intimidation of the Indian Government, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary and MP Udaya Gammanpila said today.
Addressing a media briefing, MP Gammanpila said Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella once refused to accept the fact that this bridge would be constructed when MP Gammanpila inquired about it in Parliament after seeing a news item published in an Indian newspaper.
That news piece reported a statement made by the Indian Highways Minister in Parliament saying the Hanuman Bridge would be built connecting Sri Lanka and India. When I inquired about it from Minister Kiriella he asked me to believe what is said in Sri Lankan Parliament. Even the Prime Minister asked me to do the same, he added.
He said this fact has been proved after a statement made by Investment Promotion Minister Kabir Hashim at an investors conference which was recently held in Indonesia.
While replying to a question asked by a foreign investor Minister Hashim confirmed to the international gathering that the Hanuman Bridge will be constructing connecting the two countries, he said.
He requested the Government to restrain from taking such a step which would place Sri Lanka's independence at stake. He also urged that a referendum be held to obtain the peoples opinion for this if the Government was to continue with this project.
He alleged the Government had concealed facts about this project even after several inquires made by him in Parliament.
Constructing of a bridge to connect India and Sri Lanka is not to join the two countries but to connect Northern Province of Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu. If the Government proceeds with this project, Sri Lanka would have to face many issues in sectors such as health, education and occupations, he added.
He said they were even ready to blast out the Hanuma Bridge for the sake of the national security if it would be constructed in the future. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Govt. trying to sneak out dialysis to India: GMOA
	
Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya said he had learnt that of attempts by the top brass of the Government to outsource dialysis service of kidney patients to Indian companies.
Dr. Padeniya was delivering a speech at the function to mark the launch of book titled Wakugadu Satana by Dr. Channa Jayasumana.
He said his office learnt of such a project proposal by the Government to be implemented through surreptitious means.
He said the GMOA would seek the document containing these proposals from the respective authorities.
Commenting on the Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) in the country, he said though it was called the disease of unknown origin, the etiological factor was well established at the moment.
The origin is known. But, it is called unknown origin. That is for the convenience to distract attention from reality, he said.
Instead of addressing the kidney issue, he said the authorities concerned were planning to outsource dialysis of patients to India.
Referring to the proposed Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) with India, he said the GMOA, as the professional body of medical practitioners, had the legitimate right to be involved in the process to ensure clarity in the interest of the country.
He said health in all policies was the principle in evolving matters concerning a country.
Dr. Padeniya noted that economic, environmental and health aspects had to be considered in signing international agreements and therefore GMOA would strive to see that all were cleared. (Kelum Bandara)

No more political activities at 23 public grounds in Colombo
	
Political rallies and meetings will no longer be held at some 23 public grounds located in Colombo and its suburbs including the Hyde Park Corner, the Colombo Municipality said yesterday.
Among the 23 grounds, the renovation works of some ten public grounds had already begun, CMC Commissioner M.K.V.Anura said.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, CMC Commissioner M.K.V.Anura said no political party or trade union would be allowed to hold their rallies and meetings at the grounds including the Hyde Park Corner ground, Maligawatte P.D. Sirisena football ground, Ratnam Ground Colombo 13 and Nawagampura Ground, Colombo which were currently being renovated.
" The Hyde Park Corner Ground is being converted into a foot ball complex," he said.
Hyde Park Corner Ground was earlier a football complex used by the public. After the political rallies and meetings started to take place there, the opportunity for the public to use the grounds for sports is lost, Mr. Anura said.
He said the grounds which were earlier used as a sport complex, later were utilised for political rallies which became a nuisance. Hence such public grounds should be given only to the public.
"The renovation works started at the Hyde Park Corner Grounds are scheduled to be completed in ten days time," Mr. Anura said. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Not against selling loss making SoEs: JVP
	
Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said yesterday they were ready to co-operate in selling loss making State-owned Enterprises (SoEs), which do not have a direct impact on the public lives.
While delivering a speech at the Sri Lanka Economic Summit 2016 in Colombo last night, he said the management of loss making SoEs should be handed over to private investors without settling the loss.
If the government is capable of settling the loss, it should also be able to manage SoEs afterwards. Therefore, loss making government institutions should be handed over without writing off the bad debt. Similarly, if the government could take over the liabilities of SriLankan Airlines prior to the sale of the carrier to a private party, they should also be able to take over the assets and run the airline, he said.
With regards to the proposed PublicPrivate Partnership for SriLankan Airlines, the government has indicated its willingness to write off the liabilities burdening the tax payer to make it look better in an apparent attempt to dress up the bride.
MP Dissanayake reiterated the significance of the state continuing to own a share in the market economy in every sector to avoid possible cartels by a few rogue traders to manipulate markets.
Therefore, especially in a small economy like ours, the government must protect its share in the markets to the best interest of the people and also to uplift their living standards, which is a standard of measure in economic development, emphasized Dissanayake.
He said apart from the privatization of Sri Lanka Telecom, all other privatization programmes have failed in the past and therefore, there was a reasonable fear among the people on the privatization as they have not delivered the desired results expected by them.

One dead, five injured in central London knife attack
	
A woman has died and five other people were injured in a knife attack in Russell Square, central London.
Police were called at 22:33 BST on Wednesday to reports of a man injuring people with a knife.
One of the victims, a woman in her 60s, was treated at the scene but was pronounced dead a short time later.
A 19-year-old man was arrested at 22:39 after a Taser was discharged by an officer. The Met said mental health was a "significant factor" in the events.
Two other women and three men received various injuries in the attack, Scotland Yard confirmed later.
The Met's assistant commissioner for specialist operations, Mark Rowley, said the force's homicide command was leading the investigation into the attack, with support from the counter-terrorism unit.
He went on: "Of course at this stage we should keep an open mind regarding motive and consequently terrorism as a motivation remains... one line of inquiry for us to explore."
A police forensics tent has been erected on Southampton Row, outside the park in the centre of the square, which is close to the British Museum.
There is a heavy police presence in the area and the initial cordon around the crime scene has been extended, according to BBC reporter Andy Moore at the scene.
The condition of those injured and the extent of their injuries is not known at present. (BBC)

VAT Bill should not be passed: MR
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa today said the Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill should not be allowed to be passed into law.
It is taken up for vote on August 11 in Parliament.
The Kurunegala district Parliamentarian in a statement said, This draft legislation seeks to revive and give legal effect to all the objectionable features of the VAT reforms that were suspended by the Supreme Court last month. The new VAT Bill seeks to increase the VAT rate from 11% to 15%, to bring the small and medium retail and wholesale trade and the private health care services within the ambit of VAT and to mandatorily require all establishments with a turnover exceeding Rs. 33,000 a day to register for VAT. A tax on health care is in effect a tax on ill health. The more serious the illness, the more revenue the government will make from that patient. Everyone knows that those who make use of private health services are not only the rich.
Traders and small businessmen countrywide, opposed the 15% VAT imposed on the wholesale and retail trade because it will cause an increase in the prices of goods when it is passed onto the consumer and lead to reduced sales. Previously the VAT on the retail and wholesale trade was limited to large establishments with a turnover of more than Rs. one million a day. But when the threshold is brought down to Rs. 33,000 a day, that brings even small establishments within the ambit of VAT. When retail sales drop as a result of increased prices, that leads to a chain reaction whereby the manufacturers who supply the goods dont get enough orders to be able to break even,.
