About 8 MPs are dual citizens: PHU
	
At least eight MPs are dual citizenship holders and the court ruling on Geetha Kumarasinghe should apply to these MPs as well, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila told a news conference yesterday.
He said he had submitted the list of parliamentarians to the Department of Immigration and Emigration requesting it to confirm as to who among them were dual citizens.
Mr. Gammanpila said he had made his application under the Right to Information Act.
?Nothing has been confirmed yet. However, I will know the details within a month,? he said adding that the sentence meted out to Ms. Kumarasinghe should be meted out to any of the other MPs found guilty of being dual citizens. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

After months of turmoil South Koreans go to the polls to elect new president
	
?
By Anna Fifield ? WORLD, ?(c) 2017, The Washington Post ? ? May 09, 2017 -
SEOUL - Millions of South Koreans are going to the polls Tuesday to elect a new president, bringing about an end to six months of political turmoil but opening a new and potentially difficult chapter in relations with the United States. ??
Moon Jae-in, a progressive candidate who wants to resume engagement with North Korea at a time when the international community is stepping up sanctions, looks likely to win. ??
Opinions polling was suspended Wednesday, but the final polls consistently gave Moon a support level of 40 percent, double the level recorded by his closest rivals, conservative Hong Joon-pyo and centrist Ahn Cheol-soo. ??
?Please give me the power to overcome national crises,? Moon, the candidate for the progressive Democratic Party, said at a rally in Seoul on Monday. ?The Republic of Korea is going through a national emergency in national security, diplomacy and economy. Without united power of the people, my first step cannot be steady. We need to overcome these crises as a unified nation.? ??
He held his final rally Monday night in Gwanghwamun Plaza, the central square where hundreds of thousands of South Koreans held demonstrations over a period of six months, calling for the removal of former president Park Geun-hye. ??
Park, South Korea?s first woman president and the daughter of military strongman president Park Chung-hee, was dismissed from office in March and is now behind bars while on trial for 18 charges including bribery and corruption. ??
.Park was impeached for her role in a massive corruption scandal that embroiled her presidential office, prosecutors and the head of the pension fund, and the leaders of the country?s biggest conglomerates. Lee Jae-yong, the scion of the powerful family that controls Samsung, is also in detention and on trial for his alleged role in the corruption scandal. ??
South Koreans are eager to put the turmoil of the last six months behind them and restore some stability at a time when President Trump has tough words for both South and North Korea, and when Kim Jong Un?s regime is issuing a steady stream of threats and missiles. ?
?
In an editorial titled ?From garbage to a garden,? the JoongAng Ilbo, one of the three biggest newspapers, said the turmoil of the past six months ?has pushed the country into an unprecedented chaos.? ??
?Today?s election offers a great opportunity to put the troubled nation back on track,? it wrote. ??
The DongA Ilbo, another leading paper, said that the Park Geun-hye administration ?was an anachronistic throwback to the post-democratic era before 1987.? ??
?People want a new leadership,? it wrote, declaring that the ?days of imperial presidency in South Korea are being numbered.? ??
?The president whom we have voted for today should not be one of the presidents witnessed by many other eras; we need someone who will open the door to a new era,? it said. ??
More than a quarter of electors had cast their ballots in early voting, but tens of millions more were expected to vote Tuesday, with some analysts projecting that turnout could be as high as 90 percent. ??
Voting began at 6 a.m. local time and 6 million people had voted by 10 a.m., according to the National Election Commission. ??
Moon cast his vote with his wife, Kim Jung-sook, at a middle school in central Seoul Tuesday morning, surrounded by throngs of reporters. ??
Polling stations will stay open until 8 p.m., instead of the usual 6 p.m. because this is a snap election. Exit polls will be released soon after the polling stations close, but official results are not expected until about midnight local time. ??
The victor will immediately become president, without the usual two-month-long transition period, after the official results come from the National Election Commission. He will be sworn in before the National Assembly Wednesday morning. ??
Moon has put the economy at the forefront of his campaign, promising to put together a huge stimulus package and to lessen the disparity between rich and poor. ??
His core policy proposals include job creation, with the specific pledge to create 810,000 public-sector positions; reducing long working hours; improving transparency in government appointments; and strengthening regulations on the huge conglomerates that dominate corporate South Korea and have been implicated in recent corruption scandals. ??
Although domestic issues have dominated this campaign, foreign affairs is much higher up the agenda than usual, in large part because of Trump?s election in the United States and the stance he has taken on both North and South Korea. ??
Moon has vowed to review the Park government?s decision to host a controversial American missile defence system and to resume economic cooperation with North Korea, including reopening a joint factory park on the northern side of the border that Park said was funneling money to the Kim regime. ??

Controlling children?s temper tantrums
	
?
QWhat are the root causes that could lead a child to develop temper tantrums accompanied with physical aggression at a very young age ?
Temper tantrums in themselves are not abnormal or even unusual. The terrible twos and threes are well known to seasoned parents! However if these tantrums are destructive or persist beyond a certain age, ?then it is a cause for concern. ??
The main causes related to this are temperamental factors on one hand and environmental factors on the other. ??
Some children are endowed with a difficult temperament that makes them difficult to sooth. They could also be demanding. Early tantrums could also be signs of disorders such as Autism, or a trajectory towards other disorders such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. The temper tantrums of special needs children may be related to sensory needs and may not be a part of bad behaviour. These episodes are sometimes called meltdowns, to differentiate them from temper tantrums. However it is important to emphasise that most children with temper tantrums do not have other associated disorders or conditions. ?Environmental factors could be found in the living space the child lives and plays in. If the child is not able to explore his environment and is restricted, this may lead to frustration. A chaotic relational environment where the child does not have at least one secure caregiver could also lead to behavioral problems. The other major environmental factor would be how parents and other significant adults respond to temper tantrums. Thus, if parents respond to a tantrum, for example by giving an ice cream that was initially refused, that behavior will be reinforced!
??QHow could parents address this problem if these characteristics are evident in their children?
If a condition mentioned above is suspected, it is important to seek help, as most of these conditions benefit from early identification and intervention. ??
One very important aspect of managing tantrums is to identify its function. For example, if the child is upset because he or she feels insecure, no amount of ignoring his behaviour will help. On the other hand, if what the child wants from their bad behaviour is given to appease him or to punish him- for example, where a child wants to leave his class and is ?punished? by being sent out of the class, the teacher may be unknowingly reinforcing the child?s behaviour. ?
If the temper tantrum is being used to get something the child wants, it is best not to pay attention to it. It is also important to keep in mind that ignoring this behaviour will likely make it escalate before subsiding. When you start responding differently, a behaviour that has been present for sometime is unlikely to go away all at once. As it has been reinforced for a long time, it is important to make sure the child is not in public when you correct him. ??
The other aspect of this approach is that parents also need to pay attention and positively reward the child when he is not throwing a tantrum. This is done so that the child?s bad behaviour is discouraged and good behaviour is reinforced. It is also important that parents spend adequate time with their children and engage in play and other activities with them. ??
Finally, temper tantrums can be complicated and difficult to control. If they are extreme, it is best to seek help. ??

Dragons pose a new challenge to them
	
?
Government of the Dragon Nation has at long last taken up cudgels against the JO leadership for trying to undermine the Hambantota port deal.?
?
The Dragon government which avoided making any adverse comment against their long standing friends now heading the JO has in a surprise move broken the ice, they say.
According to a story making rounds in political circles, the Dragons have got a very valid reason for their immediate provocation.
The fact that the JO which raised a hue and cry against the Hambantota project despite it being a PPP (Public-private partnership) venture, opting to turn a blind eye to the proposal to give India a stake in the Trinco harbor has come as an unpleasant surprise to the Dragons, they say.
Now that the Dragons have conveyed their displeasure to the former strongman through diplomatic channels, the JO leaders are putting thick heads together to find a solution to the problem of keeping the Dragons in their good books while standing pat on their stance on both issues, they say.

There is a top team member in yahapalanaya who is said to be lamenting that he was unable to provide jobs to the unemployed youth in his constituency except to one person during the past two years despite his top team status.?
?
The young politico who, by the way, was responsible for firing the first telling salvo at the previous regime that paved the way for heralding yahapalanaya was assigned a key ministry with a State-owned undertaking coming under its purview which is a veritable gold mine for generating job opportunities. However, the head of this undertaking being a member of a very high family in the country is much more powerful and its chief executive is still more powerful than the top team member, they say.
The highly disconcerted purohita has vowed during a chat with an economic whiz-kid in the JO that he was biding his time before taking a momentous decision about his political future.?

## Title: Have you ?room? for ?Oral Wisdom??

Have you ?room? for ?Oral Wisdom??
	
?
?At present, wisdom teeth have been identified as a problem for many patients. This is mainly because of the lack of space in the jaw to accommodate these teeth?
While there are many serious health issues that currently plague the population, it is necessary to include dental complications in the list. It is true that dental issues take a backseat when compared with more pressing health matters and very few are concerned with oral hygiene. Wisdom teeth takes the cake when it comes to being a pain in the mouth. ??
What exactly is a wisdom tooth? Despite the speculation that exists among people that wisdom teeth can make you wiser, this isn?t true. On a more serious note, it was felt that the public?s eyes had to be opened and awareness raised regarding wisdom teeth. To bring oral hygiene into the limelight, the health capsule spoke to dental surgeon, Dr. (Mrs.) Machila Perera, to gain more insight into wisdom teeth and their complications
?
What is a wisdom tooth?
It is the third molar, the last of the molar teeth to erupt in the oral cavity in the permanent dentition of the upper and lower jaws. The formation of the third molar starts at the age of 7-9 years although they start erupting between the ages of 18-24, appearing at a time when one is considered to be more mature and wise, hence ?wisdom teeth?. People develop four wisdom teeth, two each in the upper and lower jaws.
?
The function of wisdom teeth
Anthropologically speaking, Dr. Machila said our human ancestors had an abrasive diet and wisdom teeth came in handy to grind food. It was thought that human ancestors had larger jaws with more space to fully accommodate the third molar. Over time, as our diet became softer, jaws evolved to be smaller, reducing space to accommodate wisdom teeth. ??
Speaking on the clinical significance of wisdom teeth, Dr. Machila stated, ?At present, wisdom teeth pose a problem to many patients. They are the most commonly impacted teeth in the human oral cavity.? She also went onto say that if a wisdom tooth had fully erupted, the patient was lucky as it would function as a normal tooth with the least amount of complications associated with the third molar. There could also be the fully erupted wisdom teeth which may not give any trouble or could be very mild. ?Troubles arise with the partially impacted wisdom teeth. They are classified by the direction and depth of impaction, amount of available space for tooth eruption, amount of soft tissue (gums) or hard tissue (jaw bone) that cover the teeth. ?Dental surgeons can assess the difficulty of the teeth erupting and thereby decide on whether it should be removed or not, depending on the inconvenience caused to the patient. ??
?
Common complaints
?
?
Dr. Machila said common complaints occurring due to wisdom teeth were related to the difficulty in brushing the molars at the corners of the mouth.?
This could lead to numerous problems, the common being:?
1. infection of gums around the wisdom tooth (known as pericoronitis) that ranged from mild to severe. This is also the most common reason for wisdom tooth removal.?
2. The second complaint is dental caries or tooth decay. The decay could spread to other teeth, namely the second molar.?
3 - 4. Other complaints are periodontal diseases and cyst formation. ?
?
Other complications
Dr. Machila also spoke about a few other complications that could arise due to wisdom teeth extraction but said there was no cause for alarm. Drinking hot water, probing with the tongue and washing the mouth constantly are also some of the don?ts that have to be paid attention to. Patients may also sometimes be susceptible to infections, 3-7 days after surgery. With lower wisdom teeth removal, altered sensation of the lower lip, chin and teeth may be experienced and will only last for a few days and subside later on
?
How can we identify problems with wisdom teeth early?
It is advisable for all patients in their late teens and early twenties to go for dental check-ups which Dr. Machila added was not very frequently done in Sri Lanka. ?Patients will be reviewed with periodic dental radiographs (X rays) which help dental surgeons decide on the possibility of tooth eruption. ??
?
Management of wisdom teeth and treatment after surgery
?If wisdom teeth cause problems such as periodontal disease, cavities that can?t be restored, cysts or other pathologies or even damages to neighboring teeth, extraction will be required.? Dr. Machila mentioned that extraction could be either normal or surgical, depending on the degree of impaction.
Surgical removal is done under local or general anesthesia or sedation. She also mentioned the problems that can be expected after surgical removal of the wisdom tooth, all the while stressing on the fact that they were completely normal and that there was no need to be alarmed or to fear surgery. ?Analgesics will be prescribed to reduce the pain. Patients may also experience blood stained saliva which is normal. They will have to stick to soft diets for a couple of days due to the difficulty in swallowing. Jaw stiffness and sensitive adjacent teeth are also the other effects that may remain for a few days. Simply follow the post-surgical instructions and medicine given by the dental surgeon. ?Wisdom tooth extraction is a very common and safe surgery. It is also important to keep in mind that the after-effects differ from patient to patient. Patients need to discuss their complaints with the dental surgeon to get a complete clear picture prior to giving consent to the surgery.? ?

The Green leader, incidentally Number two in yahapalanaya had complimented the purohita concerned for his great efforts to bring about a quick economic recovery at a recent conference with Number One where the proposal to remove him from the current portfolio had come up, they say.?
Given the stand taken up by the Green leader, the proposed reshuffle has gone into a tailspin, they say.

How to tape your feet for release?
	
?
Do you experience severe heel pain as soon as you get out of bed in the morning? Does it feel better to stay in bed the whole day rather than exercise or go jogging??
One of the commonest limb conditions involving the heel, known as ?Plantar Fasciitis?, has a high incidence among individuals who use their lower limbs with more energy and more frequency. ?
?
What is plantar fasciitis?
It is a type of injury commonly seen in athletes and soldiers who walk or run for many hours on grounds with hard surfaces, such as rough gravel. Furthermore, this can also affect overweight (obese) individuals and those who wear uncomfortable or poorly-fitting shoes. Middle-aged women are also at high risk and those with tight calf muscles or Achilles tendons which limit the flexing capacity of the ankles are also vulnerable. ??
According to the latest research, individuals born with hereditary flat feet or high arches may also have plantar fasciitis, due to their feet constantly touching the ground and resulting in an undue strain on the heel. ??
As far as the pathophysiology behind plantar fasciitis is concerned, the thick band of tissue-ligament known as plantar fascia which runs across the base of your foot connecting the heel bones to the toes, thus creating the arch of the foot, may become inflamed. This gives rise to warmth, redness, swelling, stiffness, pain and relative immobility. ?
In healthy individuals, this ligament is able to bear a massive degree of pressure and thereby act as a shock absorber, being resistant to daily wear and tear. However, if the level of tension exceeds the limit or if there are some underlying medical conditions which result in the weakening of the ligament, this could give rise to inflammation even after minor trauma or strain. ??
?
Are you a victim?
Symptoms of this condition varies from person to person, depending on the severity, anatomical location of the impaired structures and their relationship with nearby tissues, ligaments and nerves in the area. ??
In fact, most affected individuals will initially have a sharp stabbing pain, often referred to as a ?stone bruise?, which arises when the feet touch the floor while walking or after getting out of bed. This pain characteristically reduces with the elevation of the limb. This might worsen following prolonged hours of standing, sitting or climbing stairs and running. ?
Moreover, some people may also describe this pain as a dull ache or discomfort which often arises from the mid foot area, whereas some will have a burning sensation in the sole, which is felt to be radiating away from the heel towards the ankle. ?
However, if your foot pain worsens towards the end of the day, it is highly recommended to consider possible causes such as arthritis and Tarsal tunnel syndrome, which should be diagnosed with imaging techniques like X ray of the foot and following medical guidance. ?
If you have these signs and symptoms, seek immediate medical advice. Early intervention will play a major role in helping you avoid possible lifelong disabilities caused by Plantar Fasciitis. ??
?
What are the treatment options available?
As far as the major treatment approaches for this condition are concerned, finding out the responsible etiology is important to prevent further episodes. A proper history on the initiation, history of trauma, symptoms, along with a complete physical examination to determine the level of disability and affected areas are necessary to provide a quick recovery. ?According to most medical practitioners, plantar fasciitis is a self-limiting condition which will often resolve spontaneously with appropriate pain relief and bed rest-immobilization. If the primary management options such as anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), rest, modification of activity, corticosteroids, botulinum toxin type A, splinting, shoe modifications and orthoses do not work, 10% of patients may require surgical intervention. ??
?
Plantar fasciitis taping
?Plantar fasciitis taping? is a very common technique used to treat patients with this condition and is known to be effective in relieving the stress on the plantar fascia ligament. It is also known to relieve pain and inflammation associated with plantar fasciitis, heel spurs and other inflammatory conditions resulting in foot pain. ?
A method widely used among athletes to reduce heel strain by lowering the stretchable ability of the plantar fascia ligament is wrapping an athletic or kinesiology tape tightly around the foot. This will eventually reduce the incidence of wear and tear injuries. ?
In order to maximize the effectiveness of this method, individuals currently suffering from plantar fasciitis can be treated with a combination of taping and other options like pain relief and anti-inflammatory drugs for a quick recovery. Taping individually will help to prevent future occurrences, as an early preventive measure. ?
?
How can you apply the tape?
The tape is usually applied in the morning to reduce the strain throughout the day or just prior to exercise, in order to keep the fascia from moving too much during physical activity. ??
Keep in mind not to leave your foot taped throughout the day and night because this will limit blood flow and prevent normal metabolic activities. It is also important to paste the tape properly, so it is advisable to clean the foot with a non-moisturising soap and dry it prior to taping. ??
?
Step-by-step procedure
1. Begin with the tape wrapped around the ball of the foot (metatarsal) area. ?
2. Then, wrap another piece of tape around the heel, attaching it to the tape around the ball of the foot as shown in the picture. ?
3. Place a strip of tape around the metatarsal region and cross the mid-foot diagonally before wrapping it around the heel and crossing the mid-foot again. ??
4. This will be visible as an X shape across the mid-foot and will be responsible for providing support to the plantar fascia. ??
5. The taping should be done about three times to ensure a strong support. ?
6. To wrap up the process, apply the tape horizontally across the foot to cover the previous strips. ??
7. The bottom (plantar) surface of the foot should be seen almost entirely covered from the metatarsal region to the heel which will add the support required to allow the fascia ligament to rest with limited movements. ?
The success rate for complete recovery following this treatment will depend on the pathology of the condition, habits of the individual and lifestyle. high-risk groups, while providing an effective pain relief for those already. ?

## Title: Hyperglycaemia in Pregnant Mothers

Hyperglycaemia in Pregnant Mothers
	
Hyperglycaemia during pregnancy is one of the main causes for the birth of large babies and it can also cause complications to both the baby and the mother. Speaking to Dr. U.D.P. Rathnasiri, Consultant Obstetrician/Gynaecologist, Castle Street Hospital, Health Capsule learned that if no monitoring and regulation is done, pregnant mothers who have never suffered from diabetes may have an unfortunate surprise sprung on them. ??
?
What is Hyperglycaemia?
?Hyperglycaemia occurs when the blood glucose levels are not in the normal range before or after meals. However most often, we take this into consideration after meals. If the blood sugar levels are above the normal range, we consider it hyperglycaemia. During pregnancy we test for hyperglycaemia through blood sugar,? said Dr. Rathnasiri. ??
He further said there were two categories of patients when it came to hyperglycaemia during pregnancy. ?The first category includes mothers who are already hyperglycaemic before the pregnancy. These mothers may have chronic diabetes even before pregnancy. The second category are mothers who are normoglycaemic, which means their blood sugar levels are normal before pregnancy. Later they develop hyperglycaemia during their pregnancy. This is called gestational diabetes or pregnancy-induced hyperglycaemia. Not all mothers will develop this condition. Usually around 10% of them will develop it.? ??
?
Causes
Speaking of the causes he said, ?If the patient already has diabetes, it?s usually because the blood sugar is not controlled adequately by the body?s hormonal mechanism, which is insulin. The reason why insulin cannot control blood sugar in the body can be due to the deficiency of the pancreas which produces it. Sometimes hormones produced during pregnancy can develop resistance to insulin.? ??
?When we have meals, sugar is absorbed by our body. The sugar is controlled by insulin. If there is an inadequate amount of insulin in the body, blood sugar levels can go up.? ??
?At the start, insulin levels are not affected but as the pregnancy advances, some hormones produced by the placenta may have a resistance to insulin, as they contain antagonists. These hormones may act against the insulin hormone. Thus, the problem may not be due to the reduction of insulin in the body but because hormones are ineffective in controlling blood sugar.? ??
?Hyperglycaemic mothers and normoglycemic mothers may develop diabetes during pregnancy due to hormonal changes that occur at this time. Hormonal changes during pregnancy take place in every mother but if the pancreas can increase its insulin production, the patient won?t go into a hyperglycaemic condition since their blood sugar levels are controlled. In case the pancreas can?t produce the additional requirement, they will develop hyperglycemia,? he added. ??
?
Symptoms
Dr. Rathnasiri further spoke about primary and secondary symptoms that could be identified. ?Sometimes patients may be asymptomatic, meaning they don?t develop symptoms. Symptoms of hyperglycaemia may include sweating and giddiness. Some patients can even go into a comatose state if the blood sugar level is very high. In the worst case scenario they can even go into ketoacidosis.? ??
?These are mostly direct symptoms but secondary symptoms such as hypertension, urinary tract infection and fungal infection can also take place. Sometimes they can cause blindness, retinal problems, renal problems, and nerve problems. This is not limited to pregnant mothers and anyone with chronic diabetes can go through this.? ??
?
Effects on the baby?
He further explained that it was not just the mother who was affected, but the unborn baby as well. ?If blood sugar is not controlled early in the pregnancy, this could cause foetal abnormalities early on in the pregnancy. Later on the baby can develop macrosomia, which is when the baby is larger than the average size. If it?s not managed properly, it could lead to the baby?s death.? ??
If it is a large baby, problems during labour and at the time of delivery could occur. After the delivery, if it is not controlled, babies can develop hypoglycaemia, the increase in the hemoglobin levels in their body, electrolyte imbalance, poor breathing and hypothermia. If they are delivered prematurely, they may have problems with respiration (respiratory distress syndrome). This does not happen to all babies but only with those who are not monitored properly after delivery.? ?
?
Medical Management
Dr. Rathnasiri further said pregnant mothers? blood sugar levels should be monitored before, after and during the pregnancy. ?Before the pregnancy, mothers should undergo tests to check if they are normoglycaemic. If they have hyperglycaemia they should control their blood sugar and get it regulated.Treatment is directed to control blood sugar. The majority of these cases can be controlled through diet and lifestyle modifications. Doing exercises and avoiding eating sugar-based foods, drinking alcohol and smoking can help control the situation. Mothers should also avoid stress during pregnancy. If blood sugar is not controlled through diet and exercise alone, the patient will require drugs. Some patients can be treated with oral hypoglycemic drugs which are tablets and some will need insulin. The majority of these cases can be controlled through diet alone.? ?
?Treatment has to be done with regular blood sugar monitoring and monitoring of the baby?s growth. The blood sugar will have to be controlled meticulously and the planning of the timing of delivery is important. ??
When it comes to diabetic mothers, their pregnancy should not go beyond 40 weeks. If they are on insulin, we usually deliver the baby at around 38 weeks. If they are on metformin or oral drugs, the delivery is usually done at around 39 weeks. So it is important to have meticulous control of blood sugar before as well as during pregnancy.? ??
?After delivery, blood sugar monitoring should be done because some of these mothers who develop diabetes during pregnancy are more prone to getting chronic diabetes later,? Dr. Rathnasiri advised.?

In France, a hack falls flat
	
?
By Isaac Stanley-Becker, Ellen Nakashima (c) 2017, The Washington Post ?? May 09, 2017 - ??
PARIS - It was an 11th-hour surprise that seemed to offer final proof of how closely this weekend?s critical French election mirrored the high-stakes American contest last fall. ??
And yet the reaction couldn?t have been more different. ?
?
A centrist candidate who embraced globalization was facing off against a populist, anti-immigrant firebrand who spoke warmly of Russia. Terrorism was at the forefront of the discussion. Voter distrust ran high. ??
And then, minutes before the close of campaigning Friday night, the campaign team of Emmanuel Macron -an independent running under the banner of his brand-new ?En Marche!? (Onward!) party- announced that its internal communications had been compromised and scattered across social media. ??
?Intervening in the last hour of the official campaign, this operation is obviously a democratic destabilization, as has already been seen in the United States during the last presidential campaign,? Macron?s staff said Friday night, minutes before the start of a strict curfew on campaigning, which made further public response off-limits. ??
The announcement was all too familiar for those who had watched as embarrassing internal communications from Hillary Clinton?s presidential campaign seeped onto the Internet last summer, much to the delight of her opponent, Donald Trump, who won an upset victory in November. The correspondence, which included discussion of the Democrat?s private email server and the assessment of her own aides that her instincts could be ?terrible,? became one of the tools Republicans used to disparage Clinton.
??
In France, few people even knew what was in the Macron team?s emails. The blanket ban on campaigning meant that far-right candidate Marine Le Pen and her National Front couldn?t mention them, though a deputy leader of her party did tweet early Saturday, ?Will #Macronleaks teach us something that investigative journalism has deliberately killed?? ??
The answer was no. Most media chose to heed a request from the France?s electoral commission not to reproduce the emails? contents. Le Monde, the major French daily, said in a statement that it had seen part of the documents but would not publish their details before the election, due to the volume of the dump and because the release had ?the clear goal of harming the validity of the ballot.? ??
The paper?s editor, Jerome F?noglio, said in an interview that the documents would have been leaked earlier if they had contained damaging information. As it was, he said, ?the best hope was to make noise.? ??
He said the response of the media in France carried lessons for journalists elsewhere, including those in the United States who rushed to reproduce pre-election leaks without thoroughly investigating their origins. ? ??Hiding information is not the same thing as refusing to be manipulated by those who diffuse the information,? F?noglio said. ? Voters, meanwhile, mostly waved away the news, saying their decision came down to more consequential matters. And they backed Macron by a wide margin, 66 to 34 percent, handing him a decisive victory over Le Pen. ??
?The release is not important to me,? said Mich?le Monnery, 74, after casting her vote for Macron in Laon, a small city in the north. ?What matters to me is stopping Le Pen.? ??
Analysts immediately presumed the intrusion was designed to prop up Le Pen in the final stretch of a bruising campaign that had the power to dictate the future of an integrated Europe. They refrained, initially, from assigning blame for the hack, although experts concluded that its propagation began in the United States with a cluster of Twitter accounts run by members of a far-right movement whose aim is a whites-only state. ? Now multiple research firms have linked the hacks to those that compromised the Democratic National Committee last year - links suggesting that Russian intelligence services accused of interfering in the American election may have sought to do the same in France. The finding was made last month, after the first round of voting, by Trend Micro, a Tokyo-based cybersecurity firm that fingered Russian hackers, known variously as Pawn Storm, APT28 and Fancy Bear. Recent analysis by Flashpoint Intel in New York came to the same conclusion, namely that the French hack ?appears to be linked to the Russian state-sponsored campaign by APT28.?
??
Trend Micro, which has been tracking the Russian cyberthreat for years, briefed U.S., French, British and German government officials on a dramatic escalation of the Russians? hacking campaign in the spring of 2015, said Tom Kellermann, who was the firm?s chief cybersecurity officer until last year. ??
?The Russians had taken the gloves off,? he said, including by calling on cybercriminals - or what he called ?the dons of the cybercriminal community - to act as their Rottweilers.? ??
The campaign was being carried out by hackers working for the GRU, the military spy agency, under numerous monikers. PawnStorm, as Trend Micro calls the group, uses cybercriminals in part to distance its activities from the Russian government. ??

Italy seizes ship-load of tramadol for ISIS via SL
	
A ship load of tramadol allegedly from India on its way to be sold to ISIS fighters via Sri Lanka was seized by the Italian Police, Heat Street news website reported yesterday.
Italian investigators have traced the tramadol shipment consisting 37 million tablets to an Indian pharmaceuticals company called Royal International.
The company has allegedly sold the pills for US$250,000 to a Dubai-based importer. The ship had sailed from India to Sri Lanka where they disappeared from the ship?s documents.
?The containers were then shipped to Genoa, ready to be delivered to two companies in Libya, which the US Drug Enforcement Administration has informed us are linked to ISIS,? an Italian investigator has told the Times of London.
Tramadol is a painkiller which some use as a cheap alternative to cocaine.
It?s thought the tablets are frequently sold to ISIS fighters for about $2 each, meaning the haul was worth some US$75 million to whoever was planning to push them.
The tablets were found hidden in three containers in the port of Genoa. They were labelled as blankets and shampoo on a vessel destined for Misrata and Tobruk, Libya.
?Isis is making a fortune from this traffic, giving it to its fighters to make them feel no pain,? the investigator said.
According to the article, those who attacked the Bataclan music club in Paris in 2013, slaughtering 89 people, were said to be high on the amphetamine Captagon which suppresses hunger, fear and fatigue.

Lighting up lives through lanterns
	
?
With the month of Vesak having approached us, the entire island has been adorned in a d?cor of Buddhist flags, Vesak lanterns, buckets and lights. Buddhist disciples, both young and old, are hustling along the streets to shop for Vesak lanterns and most of the streets in Colombo are filled with stalls and tents selling lanterns. The lantern sellers not only lighten up their lives during the month of Vesak by making Vesak lanterns and selling them, but in this process they help lighten up the hearts and homes of the many Buddhists and believers of other religions who purchase these lanterns to celebrate Vesak. But all good things must come to an end, and eventually, Vesak will be over and soon it will be time for the lantern stalls to pack up. After Vesak, how will these people make ends meet? Is the month of Vesak the only time they make some money? What would a day in their life be like? Do they share the happiness they bring to Buddhists everywhere through their lanterns? ?
The Daily Mirror scoured through the busy streets of Colombo, speaking to the lantern sellers amidst throngs of people including little children and their parents choosing lanterns to take home. Many claimed that selling lanterns during Vesak was not enough to keep them going for the r
?
est of the year, and in order to make ends meet, they have to engage in full time jobs as well. Some of them said that times were hard and they barely managed and Vesak brought them an opportunity to earn a little extra. We also met some happy go lucky people who were doing it as a hobby and for the immense satisfaction that it brought them by displaying their Vesak lanterns. Requests were made out to the government to issue permits for Vesak stalls ahead of time so they could get their stalls ready on time. All in all, what was common among every person we spoke to was that no matter how hard up they seemed to be, they all embraced the spirit of Vesak and said that they planned to continue selling lanterns even in the future no matter how hard times get, in the true faith of Buddhism.?
?I have been making Vesak lanterns and selling them since my childhood?
S. Pavithra ?
My brothers, uncles,everyone in the family gets involved. Compared to last year, this year business has been successful. We make our own lanterns and sell them.To open up shop on time, We have to start working by January. This takes about 5 to 6 months. But the money I earn is barely enough to survive. So I have to do a permanent job. I am also engaged in the steel business. I do this every year to earn some extra money. ?
?
?
?
?
?Compared to last year, this year?s sales look better??
Chamindu Hasith?
Last year there were floods. We buy these lanterns from some others who make them and keeping a profit, we sell the lanterns at a reasonable price.We open up stalls and sell Vesak lanterns during the month of May. For the rest of the year, I stay at home. I ?don?t do any job.?
?
?
?
?
?Making Vesak lanterns brings me immense happiness?
Imantha ?
This year, business is fairly good. ?Last year the rains affected the sale of Vesak lanterns but so far so good, this year. I have been doing this for 4 years. My whole family gets involved in it. I work in a company. I just sell Vesak lanterns for fun every year. I really enjoy doing it. Every year, before selling my lanterns I donate some of my lanterns to my neighbourhood temple. Making Vesak lanterns brings me immense happiness and that is why I?m doing this.?
?
?
?
People are not financially sound; how can they afford to celebrate Vesak?
S.A. Gunawathie ?
Business is not progressing so well this year. Right after avurudhu, it?s Vesak. People spend a lot during the season. Since all the holidays fall close to one another, people find it hard to cope with all the expenses. People are not financially sound. So how can they afford to celebrate Vesak? I have been doing this for 5 years. I won?t lie, but back then the business was good. But with the prices of items rising alarmingly, nobody is in a position to spend as they wish to. It is absurd staying all night and keeping the stall open. So we close around 11.30 pm.
?
?
?
?
?
?
?
?
?Still premature to predict profits from sale of lanterns??Shanka ??
I make my own lanterns. Every detail down to the bamboo and crafted paper were results of our own labour and efforts. To finish one lantern, it normally takes 4 hours. So we put a lot of heart into what we do. This year business has been good. I can?t still say anything about the profit because we have some more days to go until Vesak and we haven?t sold all our lanterns. During rains, lanterns get perished then we have to make up for the loss. Apart from this, I do painting and designing work. For Vesak I take a break and commit myself to this stall to add some money for living.
?
?
?
?
?
Business is pretty dull this year
?Sandun Chandima
?Last year of course business went down because of the floods. This year, I don?t know what the reason is. I buy lanterns on wholesale from people who make and sell them. I only do this during Vesak. There are people who open stalls for New Year and Christmas. Obviously the money we earn by selling lanterns will not keep us going for long. We have to do jobs to survive. During Vesak I spend some time to do this.?
?
?
?
?
?
?
?
?I don?t buy from elsewhere, I sell my own lanterns?
Arjuna?
So ?far, selling Vesak lanterns has been successful. For now, I have managed to sell 300 Vesak lanterns. I sell my own lanterns, that is to say I?m the one who makes these lanterns. I don?t buy from elsewhere. To be able to complete Vesak lanterns for my stall by May, I have to start making them from January. We have to rent out tents to open up shop and we require a permit from the Municipality to do this. The problem is we don?t get the permit on time. So my request to the government is to enable us to get the permit ahead of time, so we can do better in our businesses and display our skill through the lanterns. My problem is the limited time, not money.

May Day outcome: Peace moves back on track
	
?
The Blues had on May Day come to terms with a reality that they had long skirted: they will never come to power again if they remain splintered.?
?
Following the dawning of this reality on all and sundry, a small group of party seniors the other day decided to bring pressure on both factions to bury the hatchet for an early merger. They also nominated several seniors as members of a delegation to meet both leaders to negotiate a peace settlement.?
However, a party senior from Uva who was nominated as a member of the peace delegation immediately declined saying: ?Apoi! No matter what you think about that man, I can?t be a party to a mission expected to talk peace with him again!??
This Blue senior who backed out shifted his political base from Colombo to Badulla sometime ago. However, he lost his constituency at the last poll, but managed to make it to Diyawanna thanks to the preferential vote. The other seniors, however, firm in their resolution to carry out their mission to a successful conclusion decided to pursue their goal come hell or high water.

They said the wind stirred by the whirling helicopter blades of the helicopters had blown away the asbestos roofing sheets.
When inquired from the Hatton Police the pilots had requested the police to inform the house owners to place sand bags on the roofs of their houses.
The Indian government had built a hospital complex for the Hatton-Dikoya Base Hospital at an estimated cost of Rs.5 billion. The building is to be inaugurated by the the Indian Premier before addressing the upcountry estate sector employees at the Norwood grounds. (Ranjith Rajapakse)

Modi?s visit: Ousted wasps grab international spotlight
	
The ouster of two large wasp nests from a tea plantation ahead of Indian Premier Narendra Modi?s visit has grabbed the attention of the international media while Sri Lankan officials busily prepare for the visit which is to take place this week. ?
Several media outlets highlighted the painstaking measures taken by the Hatton Police to clear the area of the tiny and often dangerous ?locals? from the premises, going so far as to rope in a private bee protection organization to evict thousands of bees to prevent a possible attack on the visiting leader. ?
Articles described wasps as commonly found insects in tropical Sri Lanka known for its formidable sting.? ?Wasp attacks are often reported in the island?s tea estates, where workers are most vulnerable,? one media outlet stated. ?
While another reported that the area had been cleared and was now safe for VVIP?s. ?The winged evictees were removed humanely and relocated to a nearby jungle. A team will remain on site to ensure those kicked out do not return before Modi touches down,? the international media outlet reported.

## Title: Muscle weakness and Sunshine

Muscle weakness and Sunshine
	
?
?
Ever wondered why your muscles feel weak? Why tasks that took very little effort are now seemingly impossible? These symptoms might mean you are suffering from severe Vitamin D deficiency. ??
Vitamin D deficiency has many names including Osteomalacia and soft bones. Vitamin D deficiency is now thought to be very common among South Asians and even Sri Lankans. Vitamin D deficiency might be a key reason for all these changes. ??
?
How does it feel to have low Vitamin D levels?
The problem with Vitamin D deficiency is that the symptoms are very slight. You might tend to ignore most of them. It is not confined to the elderly and can affect people of all ages. ??
Muscle weakness and bone pains are key symptoms. Some patients complain of body aches. Inability to climb stairs because of weak thigh muscles and a duck-like walk because of weak hips could also indicate Vitamin D deficiency Muscle weakness tends to affect the shoulders and trunk too. Bone pain is initially felt when you apply firm pressure. Sometimes when your bones hit against an object, this could cause severe pain. There could be partial fractures of bones which are termed pseudo fractures by doctors. ? ?
Please note that it?s not just Vitamin D deficiency that causes the above symptoms. Weakness could be due to a thyroid problem or even anaemia. ?
?
How does our body get Vitamin D?
Sunlight has ultraviolet B rays that are absorbed by your skin which manufactures Vitamin D molecules. These molecules are then converted by the liver and kidneys into active Vitamin D. About twenty percent of the Vitamin D is absorbed through the gut as well. This active ingredient is given the name 1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol. It is very important for body calcium regulation, bone strength and muscle functioning. ??
?
What is Osteomalacia?
If Vitamin D deficiency is very severe, it can affect the absorption of calcium from the gut. If we consider the structure of any bone, it consists of a hard outer shell (the cortex) made up of minerals - mainly calcium and phosphorus - and a softer inner mesh (the matrix) made up of collagen fibers. This inner mesh is like a cobweb; interconnected but bendable. The mesh is very weak when formed but is gradually covered or coated by calcium. This process is called mineralisation. The strength of the new bone depends on the amount of mineral covering the collagen matrix. The more mineral, the stronger the bone. ??
Osteomalacia happens if mineralization doesn?t take place properly. In Osteomalacia, more and more bone is made up of collagen matrix without a mineral covering, so the bones become soft. These softened bones may bend and crack and this can be highly painful. There are rarer types of Osteomalacia which are sometimes seen in children.
?
??
Who gets Osteomalacia?
People who do not go out in the sun for at least 15 minutes a day could be at risk. Even covering the entire body so that sun rays cannot reach the skin might be a problem. People who have a dark complexion are also at risk. ??
We now emphasise on the importance of a diet rich in Vitamin D. Diets lacking in Vitamin D might be a major risk factor. Dairy products and oily fish are good dietary sources of Vitamin D. ??
There are of course rarer causes of Osetomalacia. If one has severe kidney or liver disease, this prevents Vitamin D from becoming activated. Diseases of the gut which prevent the proper absorption of Vitamin D like inflammatory bowel disease can cause Osteomalacia as well.?
?
How is Vitamin D deficiency diagnosed and treated?
There is a blood test which detects Vitamin D levels. Although this is the most accurate way of diagnosing the condition, it is expensive. We mainly go by the symptoms and treat patients, as it involves only vitamin supplementation. ??
Vitamin D is provided to patients in the form of tablets or injections.?
I ask patients to modify their lifestyle while continuing the supplements. Diets rich in Vitamin D, plenty of daily sunshine (without umbrellas and sunblock!), reducing alcohol intake and regular exercise helps. The best time to go out in the sun is between 11 am and 3 pm when Vitamin D production beneath the skin is at its highest. Many people are unnecessarily worried about tanning and skin cancer. The incidence of skin cancer caused by sunlight is exceedingly rare among Sri Lankans thanks to melanin.?

MYTH: Leprosy can be transmitted even after the patient is cured. ?
BUSTED: ?This is incorrect. Once a patient is cured of leprosy, they cannot transmit the disease. The disease is transmitted through respiration, not through contact and the bacteria that is transmitted is called Mycobacterium leprae. Once the patient takes the necessary drugs given during treatment and is cured he/she can no longer transmit the disease. This is a common misconception among people. It is because of this that there is a stigma attached to victims of leprosy. Due to this, patients who suffer from the disease usually hide it, which is the wrong thing to do.? explained Dr. Priyantha Karunarathna, Director of the Anti Leprosy Campaign. ? ??

North-Central Provincial Council?s Health Minister K.H. Nandasena, who had attended the joint opposition May Day rally led by former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, was today removed from his ministerial portfolio.
Mr. Nandasena was replaced by councillor M. Herath Banda and was sworn in by NCP Governor P.B.M. Dissanayake. ?
Mr. Nandasena, who was replaced with Council Member, said he was not least bit concerned about the removal.
When contacted, Mr. Nandasena said he was not officially informed about being removed from his portfolio but came to know about it from the governor?s secretary during the swearing in of the new minister.
?I even functioned as minister yesterday evening in the presence of the Governor and the Chief Minister. No one told me about this move until someone asked me if I?m aware of the swearing in of the new minister this morning. Then I called the governor?s secretary who confirmed the new appointment,? he told daily Mirror.
He said he was not given any reason for the removal and believed it was because he did not toe the government?s line.
?However, I?m not the least concerned about the removal. I will continue working for the people,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla, Athula Bandara and Dayarathna Ambogama)

President Trump fires FBI Director Comey
	
President Trump fired FBI Director James B. Comey on Tuesday, at the recommendation of senior Justice Department officials who said he had treated Hillary Clinton unfairly and in doing so damaged the credibility of the FBI and the Justice Department.
The startling development comes as Comey was leading a counterintelligence investigation to determine whether associates of Trump may have coordinated with Russia to interfere with the U.S. presidential election last year. It wasn?t immediately clear how Comey?s ouster will affect the Russia probe, but Democrats said they were concerned that his ouster could derail the investigation.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that Comey?s deputy, Andrew McCabe, would be the acting director of the FBI. As a presidential candidate, Trump explicitly criticized Comey and McCabe for their roles in the Clinton probe while at other points praising Comey for his ?guts.?
?The president has accepted the recommendation of the attorney general and the deputy attorney general regarding the dismissal of the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,? press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters in the White House briefing room. The firing is effective ?immediately,? he said.
Comey was in Los Angeles on Tuesday on a recruiting trip.
Officials said Comey was fired because senior Justice Department officials concluded that he had violated Justice Department principles and procedures last year by publicly discussing the investigation of Hillary Clinton?s use of a private email server. Democrats have long argued that Comey?s decisions in the months and days before the election hurt Clinton?s standing with voters and affected the outcome, but the president and his closest advisers had argued that Comey went too easy on Clinton and her aides.
Just last week, Trump publicly accused Comey of giving Clinton ?a free pass for many bad deeds?? when he decided not to recommend criminal charges in the case.
Officials released a Tuesday memo from the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, laying out the rationale behind Comey?s dismissal and attributing it all to his handling of the Clinton case. Officials said Rosenstein began examining Comey?s conduct shortly after being sworn into office two weeks ago. (Washington Post)

President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had come to an agreement about the time for a Cabinet reshuffle, United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera said.
While addressing at the weekly SLFP media briefing held yesterday Minister Amaraweera said there would be a definite Cabinet reshuffle.
It would be done at an opportune time by the President. This would be done with a view to expedite the government's forward march, he said.
?During the previous government that came to power in 2010 the Cabinet had been reshuffled within its first year in office. The reshuffle had come within the first three months after a new government came to power in 1994. This is the government which runs more than two years without a cabinet reshuffle,?

Rs.1,200 Mn for luxury vehicles: GL
	
At least three supplementary estimates had been presented in Parliament this year seeking approval to purchase luxury vehicles worth Rs. 1,200 million for a number of ministers, deputy ministers and officers, the Joint Opposition (JO) said yesterday.
It said the government was hell bent on enjoying privileges by expending lavishly when common citizens are engulfed in economic crisis.
?The government has no sympathy towards the people who are suffering. According to the 2016 Central Bank (CB) report, the growth rate of the economy had decreased to 4.4% from 4.8% of 2015. The inflation had increased but foreign reserves had decreased. Instead of saving people from the economic plights, the government had resorted to purchase super luxury vehicles for its members,? Professor G.L. Peiris told a news briefing.
He said the latest supplementary estimate which was presented in Parliament on Friday had sought Rs. 329 million to purchase vehicles for five ministers, two state ministers, one governor and a public officer.
?Rs. 43 million had been allocated to purchase a vehicle only for the Prime Minister?s Secretary for Parliamentary Affairs. This was not a post which existed before,? he said.
Mr. Peiris said the government had presented supplementary estimates at two previous occasions this year.
Rs. 371 million had been sought to purchase nine vehicles for ministers and deputy ministers while another Rs. 494 million had been sought at another occasion to purchase vehicles for seven ministers, three state ministers and one deputy minister. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

It is a well-known fact that all main political parties tried their level best as never before to attract the largest possible crowd to their respective May Day rallies this year. However, there is hush-hush in political circles that a certain prominent purohita and a young fair Diyawanna member had kept away from the Getamba May Day rally without giving an excuse.

The purohita who was conspicuous by his absence is known to be up in arms against a much talked about controversial deal involving the transfer of some precious assets of the country to a foreign company.

The general opinion in political circles is that the purohita had given the party?s May Day rally a miss by way of conveying a significant message to the government. Some say that the purohita who threw in his lot with yahapalanaya after playing his political innings with several other parties is poised to bat for yet another team.

Significance of Vesak
	
Vesak is a season for serious religious observances of the Buddhists, such as meditation retreats, and even religious dialogues reflecting on the profound teachings of the Buddha, but it is also a time for devotional merriment, when Buddhists become inspired, by reflecting on the Buddha, his wisdom called Dhamma, and his community of followers called the Sangha.?
Through out the month of May, and especially on the full moon day of May, they begin to express the glory of the Buddha, His wisdom and His infinite love for all beings. The profound teachings of the Buddha are expressed through vivid visual displays and solemn devotional ceremonies that mesmerise, captivate and fascinate everyone. His profound message to the world is conveyed through melodious songs, glamorous dances and fascinating plays.?
All those who come to witness the exquisite displays during Vesak begin to see the picturesque scenery created by the elegant Vesak decorations. They also begin to hear the melodious music and devotional songs, and rhythmic chants that constantly reach their ears from loud speakers, carols, pageants and pandals. They also begin to hear devotional sermons delivered by famous monastic preachers.?
Everyone absorbs and experiences the magnificent grandeur and majesty of the Buddha and his teachings through all their senses. Thus, Vesak is a magnificent ceremonial experience to all visitors, Buddhist or non-Buddhist.?
So far, we have only fed the primitive part of our brain called the reptilian brain. There is another part called the mammalian brain that is very animalistic and needs to be controlled. This is what the Buddha called ?citta.? It is the citta that is responsible for the lust (lobha), hate (dosa), and delusion (moha). The best part of the brain is the truly human brain that is able to think and reason out, which the Buddha called mano. This means the normal human being is partly animal and only partly human.?
It is interesting to know that the aim of the Buddha was to make the human being transcend the animal nature completely and become fully human. Yet, this fully human state is not normal (putujjana). It is Super Normal (ariya). It is this animal nature that is creating all the suffering in the world. The following Sanskrit verse points this out:?
Feeding, seeping, fear and sex?
?Common are these to man and beast?
?Especial to man is thought complex?
?Thought when low man is a beast?
Aharanidrabhayamaitunanca
Samanyametadpasubihsamanah
Dharmohitesamadikoviseso
Dharmenahinahpasubihsamanah
Man is an evolving animal. Modern man is highly evolved in this thinking human brain called mano. It is this thinking human brain that created the motor vehicle, the aircraft, the computer, and all the modern conveniences using electricity, magnetism and other energy sources. Ultimately, it also created the nuclear bomb that can destroy the world at the press of a button.?
Yet, with all this progress, has crime disappeared in the world? Has war vanished? Has terrorism ended? Today, the world is shivering in fear of a nuclear holocaust. Why? Although the thinking human brain has evolved, the emotional animal brain has only degenerated to a dangerous level. It has made the human being look like a child playing with dangerous toys.?
The Buddha has pointed out that, at birth, we have only the mammalian emotional brain citta. The human brain mano develops only later. Therefore, the animal brain (citta), which is responsible for our emotions, begins to dominate the rational human brain (mano). This is what has happened to us today. Every scientific invention made by the human brain was to gratify emotions. The nuclear bomb was made for this purpose too. Emotions are dominating the world.?
Emotions dominate the world?
?Emotions carry us around?
?Emotion is that one thing?
?To which all are spellbound,?
Cittenaniyatiloko
Cittenaparikassati
Cittassaekadhammassa
Sabbevavasamanvagu
It was to solve this problem of life that the Buddha pointed out the Supernormal Eightfold Way. Although the emotional brain (citta) is older than the thinking (mano), the emotions are exited only by the way the thinking mano interprets circumstances. The modern cognitive psychologists discovered this fact in the 1960s, though Sigmund Freud did not comprehend this in the 1900s, and so he thought that the emotions could not be eliminated. They could only be repressed or suppressed. Therefore to be civilised is to suffer discontentment.?
It was the Buddha who pointed out more than twenty-five centuries earlier that the emotional disturbances of the (citta) can be eliminated by the thinking (mano) because the emotional agitation depends on how the thinking (mano) interprets circumstances.?
Thinking (mano) precedes the emotional experience (Dhamma)?
?It dominates, and it creates it?
?If with bad thinking one speaks or acts (akusala dhamma)?
?Pain follows, as the wheel does the drawing beast, or engine?
Mano pubbangama dhamma
Mano settha mano maya
Manasace padutthena bhasativa karotiva
Tathonam dukkhamanveti cakkhancha vahato padam
?___ Dhammapada?
The Buddha also pointed out that the mammalian brain (citta) when emotionally exited goes against reality. The mammalian brain is unaware of reality. It wants permanence of pleasure in an impermanent world. It wants freedom from pain in a pain filled world. It wants to possess things in a world free of possession. It wants to hold on to things that cannot be held on to. All suffering is the result of impossible dreams of the animal brain. This animal brain has to be held by a rope, just as people hold animals with ropes. It has to be controlled by the human, thinking, reasoning, brain that is aware of reality. It is the thinking human brain that can comprehend Reality. The human brain has the power to control the animal brain. Yet it is not aware of this power. Therefore the human brain needs education. The human brain is not fully awake. It is dreaming of existence where existence is impossible. Existence is a static concept in a dynamic reality.?
We know that the human being has gained control over animals like the elephant, horse, ox, Camel and many such others. They have even gained control over inanimate machines created by the human being. Yet the human being has not gain control over the animal within himself. This is why we are suffering all the time. This is the most important problem to be solved. Therefore the Buddha taught the way out of suffering.?
First, the Buddha controlled his own mind and became a Buddha, an awake being. Then he set out to awaken others. He did awaken some, but many others are still dreaming, and so continue to suffer.?
So, he set out to beat the drum of immortality (amatadundubin) to save mankind:?
Aparutatesanamatassadvara
Ye sotavantopamuccantusaddan
Open is the door to immortality?
?May those who have ears?
?Listen and be free?
FROM DEATH
You do not exist?
?So how can you die??
?Open your thinking human eye?
?Be free of the blind emotional animal eye?
?That feels: ?I exist and I die??

Son is now better known than his father
	
?
A group of yahapalanaya purohitas the other day were doing a collective postmortem on the latest May Day scene in the city. Senior Banda from the central hills, the former Betel leaf secretary from the Colombo district and the former Blue party secretary from Wayamba were there among others in this group.?
?
The large crowd that turned up at Galle Face soon took the centre-stage at this discussion and each of them was trying to account for this massive crowd according to their own reasoning.?
By way of offering his own explanation for the big turn-out on Galle Face Green, the purohita from the central hills posed this question: ?Didn?t it occur to you that the latest burst-out of our big mouthed colleague was responsible for the big crowd? Was it not an angry reaction of people to the expletives he used when attacking the JO??
The purohita continued: ?One should know when and where one should vent his spleen. This fellow just shoots off his without any thought for the consequences.? However, he was careful enough not to mention the name of the colleague whom he was blaming.
One of the purohitas who looked a little bemused asked: ?I really don?t know whom you are railing at.?
? Ah! You can?t guess who he is! He is none other than the big mouthed father of the big mouthed young one who made it to the council from the Gampaha district,? a senior one from the Colombo district said.?
?O! I see now. You must be referring to the father of that young chap who landed on the Moon even before Armstrong,? another purohita said and all broke into laughter.

Speaker and Sec-Gen had been forced to annul Geetha?s seat: JO
	
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and the Secretary General of Parliament had been forced to annul the MP post of Geetha Kumarasinghe, the Joint Opposition yesterday alleged.
Addressing a press briefing, MP Wasudeva Nanayakkara said the JO has no doubt that Ms. Kumarasinghe?s removal was a result of a political revenge and alleged that the Attorney-General had forced the House to inform its decision to the Election Commission.
He said Parliament has violated the privileges of it?s members by not giving a sufficient time to appeal against the court ruling.
?According to the law, at least 42 days should be given to appeal against a court ruling before it was enforced. It had been only four days passed since the date of the Appeal Court ruling,? he said.
He said revoking the Parliament seat of Ms. Kumarasinghe was a result of a coup steered by the government with certain the SLFP members.
MP Nanayakkara said by unseating Ms. Kumarasinghe the House has ignored the peoples mandate.
Speaking on the matter MP Dullas Alahapperuma said that he didn?t expect that Parliament would take such a decision as they met Speaker on Friday where he promised to give enough time to appeal on the ruling.
MP Alahapperuma requested Speaker Karu Jayasuriya not to let down Parliament by damaging its image through the interference of Government politicians.
However, he said Speaker Jayasuriya has enough time to revise his decision and let the justice to be served. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

The First Marvel
	
By Mervyn Samarakoon. ??
?The three great wonders on earth, the great celebrations of mankind are the birth, attainment of perfection and parinirvana of the Incomparable One among men and gods, the fully enlightened Buddha. ??
On the days the memorable events and the collateral incidents occurred, the multitude of world systems inanimate as they are, thundered and shook in boundless acknowledgement of their profundity. The supernormal happenings associated with the first occurrence itself, birth of Prince Siddhartha, befitted the effort and sacrifice of an individual who strove for faultlessness from the era of Deepankara Buddha far too long for one to fathom, except a Buddha Himself. ??
From thenceforth, he roamed the habitats of the universe for million upon millions of years but never did he fall among denizens of the dark (avichi) nor in the four named ghost realms. Even when born low, never was he born as a lowly insect. As a human, never a blind man, a deaf and dumb mute, an imbecile, a woman or a hermaphrodite - Nidhanakatha. When he appeared among heavenly beings, it was never on the plane of the conscious-less (asangna) or on a pure abode (sudassa). ??
Eight conditions are prerequisite for a Bodhisattva to attain Buddhahood - birth as a human being, manhood, good fortune to behold the sight of a Buddha, bhikkhuhood, an abundance of wholesome qualities, a great desire to attain Buddhahood, adequate merit to reach arahanthood in that birth itself and willingness to sacrifice his life to a Buddha. A Bodhisattva is accomplished in several absolute perfections (parami). His dana paramitha never falls short of sacrificing his own life for another (Sasa Jataka). His degree of forgiveness does not reach an end when his life is robbed of him. ( Shanthivadi Jataka). Neither does his total truthfulness nor his steadfast determination (Magapakkha Jataka). He fears no one and no one him (Sama Jataka). Save a Buddha Himself, none can surpass his absolute equanimity (Lomahansa Jataka). Being mundane, improprieties may occur, but he wouldn?t utter a falsehood even if he is done to death. Why? He is on an unfailing journey in search of truth. The times he abandoned kingdoms fell in his lap in favour of paramitha of renunciation (Nekkhamma) are countless. Development of wisdom reached its very summit. So was the enormity of his effort. ??
Fulfilling these perfections to the letter, he makes his final appearance in the human world as king Vessantara where he makes the ultimate sacrifice of them all - forsaking his wife and children in favour of his avowed goal. That moment the feelingless, emotionless great Earth devoid of whatever sentiments shuddered seven times. At the end of his lifespan Bodhisattva is born in Thusitha deva world, the penultimate appearance of his as god or man or any other. ??
The world knows of three great commotions, Kalpa, Buddha and Chakravarthi. Gods of the kamavacara deva worlds descend upon earth in horrible disguise and move about with tearful eyes, lowered heads, disheveled hair to announce the end of the world many hundred thousand years later with the drying of the oceans and the earth ending up in a ball of fire. They invoke people to extend Metta, Karuna, Muditha to others, to care for the mother and father and respect elders. It is the kalpa commotion. ??
The second commotion is when they make the joyful announcement of the arrival of a ?Sarvagna? Buddha in a thousand years. The third is the appearance of a wheel-turning monarch. On hearing the Buddha commotion heavenly beings of a hundred thousand world systems come together to remind Bodhisattva in Thusitha that time is ripe for dawn of Buddhahood among humans. He does not directly commit himself to the suggestion, but examines whether the five preconditions are present, the time, country, specific district, particular caste and life span of the?intended mother. ??
A Buddha necessarily arises when human life is between a hundred and hundred thousand years, for a shorter period implies beings with advanced defilements, and when lives are extraordinarily long notions of old age, impermanence and death remain obscure and remote. Buddha Dhamma is beyond the grasp of both groups. The chosen land of Buddhas is India, specifically the mid district. All Buddhas, Pacceca Buddhas, chief disciples, the eighty great disciples and chakravarthi kings make their appearance is it. A Buddha is always born into a royal or Brahmin family, a rule of the world. The rule prevalent now is the former. ??
The prospective mother Queen Mahamaya?s lifespan was right, ten months and seven days at the extreme. A mother of a Buddha ceases to be fond of men or of intoxicants. Fulfilling perfections (parami) for ten thousand Kalpas, she abides by the five precepts forms birth. ??
On this particular day, Bodhisattva whilst being surrounded by heavenly beings in the spectacular Nandana garden of the Thusitha world, instantly exited from it and conceived in the womb of Queen Mahamaya. It was the celebration of Esala at Kapilawastu. The queen had bathed in perfumed water in the morning, offered a ?maha dana? costing a forty thousand, had had her breakfast, observed the eight precepts and entered the gaily furnished chamber where she fell asleep, as if awaiting the momentous occasion. ??
The unparalleled event in human history was conveyed to her in a fitting manner. She dreamt a wondrous dream where she was carried with her bed to the Himalayas by the four Guardian Gods of the world, bathed in Anothaptha lake to cleanse her of the impurities of the human world, dressed her in heavenly garb and placed on a golden bed when Bodhisattva in the form of a white elephant perambulated her thrice and entered her body from the right side on ?Uturusal Nekatha?. Instantly, the universe erupted in uncontrollable spasms of joy and a brilliant radiance spread across the entire cosmos. The deaf began to hear and the blind could see. The dumb spoke and cripples walked. Fires in the hells died out. Constant hunger of the ghost worlds disappeared, so did the animals? ever present fear. The sick were cured; people spoke kind words to each other. Elephants trumpeted and horses neighed in melodious harmony. Mild winds swept across the earth, rains fell out of season. Birds stopped flying and the rivers flowing. Blossoms sprang from the four corners of the earth. Heavenly music was heard in the skies and sweet fragrance of flowers drifted over entire galaxies thirty two such mystical happenings in all. (Apadanattakatha). ??
From the moment of conception the mother is protected by four ?devaputtas?. Her tiredness disappeared. The womb in which a Bodhisattva lives is likened to a chetiya. No other being can conceive in it, so seven days from his birth the mother necessarily passes away to appear in the Thusitha world. Women deliver children seated or while reclining in less or more than ten months of gestation, not so the mother of a Bodhisattva who always delivers the child while standing, again a norm of the world. Instantly four Maha Brahmas receive the newborn on to a golden mesh and announce a son of great omnipotence in born to the queen. The newborn isn?t smeared in excreta and other impurities but rather bears the appearance of an erudite preacher descending from his hallowed seat of preaching. ??
He was handed to the four Guardian Gods of the world by the Maha Brahmas who is turn placed him in the hands of the people present. He stepped down from their hands and took seven steps in the northern direction in the midst of unprecedented celebrations amongst gods in the heavens and humans on Earth, to pronounce as do all Buddhas-to-be the immortal stanza ?Aggo Hamasmi.........? proclaiming unsurpassed eminence and uniqueness in the world as well as banishment of renewed existence for all time. It wasn?t the first occasion Bodhisattva spoke at birth, he did so twice before as Mahoshada Panditha and as Vessantara - miracles of all time. ??
On the same day several other phenomena occurred, the births of Rahula?s queen mother, ministers Channa and Kaludai, Kanthaka the regal horse later devaputta, Bodhi tree and the appearance of four stupendous treasures beneath the earth?s surface. Bodhisattva thus born in Lumbini sal grove was taken back to Kapilavattu in great procession. A marvelous incident here gives an inkling of the state of mental and spiritual development of certain beings when a Samma Sambuddha , makes His appearance on earth. ??
Kaladevala aka Asitha the ascetic, a close associate of King Suddhodana was the possessor of eight absorptions of find material and immaterial spheres (Ashta Samapaththi). This particular day he was spending his mid-day siesta in the Thavathimsa deva world, a customary practice of his, when he observed the heavenly inhabitants engaged in joyous celebrations on a hitherto unknown scale. On inquiry, the gods told him of the birth of a son to king Suddhodana, of impending Buddhahood under the bo tree, setting in motion the Wheel of the Law (dhammachakka) and their absolute good fortune to witness His astounding glory and to hear His sublime Dhamma. ??
Instantly the ascetic descended on the king?s palace and when the king attempted to make Bodhisattva in his arms worship him, miraculously his feet came to rest on his turban, whereupon the mighty ascetic worshiped the child Bodhisattva. The king followed suit. Asitha had the capacity to see forty Kalpas into the past and forty Kalpas beyond and saw that the child was definitely destined for Buddhahood. Peering into his own life, he began to shed tears as he saw he would not live to see the amazing event, neither would he see another hundred or thousand Buddhas of the future since he would be gaining upon death, a formless existence (Arupa Bhava) of incomprehensible duration. On considering his relatives he visualized his nephew Nalaka of sufficient merit to meet and to benefit from a Samma Sambuddha. He went upto him, made him abandon an inheritance of eight hundred and seventy million and ordained him then and there with instructions to seek out the Buddha after thirty five years. He did exactly as was told, lived a solitary life in the Himalayas for thirty five years, learned from the Blessed One on the very first meeting itself, the rigorous ?moneiya? discipline of spending not more than one night in a single place, a samsaric aspiration of his. He passed into parinirvana after a brief seven months of Arahanthood. The singularly exceptional Bhikkhu earned the sacred honour of becoming the first disciple in the name of our Gautama Buddha. ??
Glad tidings the visitors from the heavens brought many centuries ago did indeed come true. ? ??

TN grads to fill in teaching vacancies in estate sector: Minister
	
The Tamil Nadu (TN) government will send over one hundred Bachelor of Science (Bsc) degree holders to Sri Lanka to fill in teaching vacancies at Tamil medium schools in the estate sector, State Minister of Education V. Radhakrishnan said.
The Minister said the decision was made by the TN government in line with a request made by the Sri Lankan government. The proposal is to be discussed further during Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi?s visit this week.
The proposal was made by the government to the Indian High Commissioner in Sri Lanka to bring down over one hundred Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree holders from Tamil Nadu to fill in vacancies for Tamil medium teachers in estate schools, he said.
Speaking to Daily Mirror, the Minister said there were 844 estate schools in the Central, Sabaragamuwa, Uva, Southern and Western provinces which had a scarcity of Tamil medium teachers for subjects such as science, mathematics and English.
?These are our people who fled the country in 1983/84 and who are now living in Tamil Nadu. We found many of their children are BSc degree holders. In addition to them, the Tamil Nadu government has agreed to send additional teachers to fill in these vacancies. They also promised to bear the cost of their salary. The government has to provide accommodation for the teachers,? he said.
State Minister Radhakrishnan said that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had instructed him to resolve issues in the estate sector with the help of the Indian government.
Meanwhile, trade unions in the education sector criticized the State Minister?s move to seek BSc graduates from Tamil Nadu to fill in the vacancies. Ceylon Teachers Union (CTU) Secretary Joseph Stalin said the State Minister?s move to bring down teachers from Tamil Nadu was questionable.
?We are not against India. But there are large numbers of Tamil graduates in Ampara, Batticaloa and Jaffna who are demanding the government provide them with employment. The National Colleges in the country also have the authority to award a BSc degree under the 1987 National College Act number 30,? he said.
The vacancies could be filled in by increasing the number of Tamil students in the National Colleges and generating the Tamil Speaking Teacher population.
The graduates from the Northern and Eastern provinces were insufficient to fill in the vacancies and many were not BSc graduates, the State Minister countered. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

US poised to expand military effort against Taliban in Afghanistan
	
?
By Missy Ryan, Greg Jaffe ? ? ?(c) 2017, The Washington Post ??
May 09, 2017 - ??
President Donald Trump?s most senior military and foreign policy advisers have proposed a major shift in strategy in Afghanistan that would effectively put the United States back on a war footing with the Taliban. ?
The new plan, which still must be approved by the president, calls for expanding the U.S. military role as part of a broader effort to push an increasingly confident and resurgent Taliban back to the negotiating table, U.S. officials said. The plan comes at the end of a sweeping policy review built around the president?s desire to reverse worsening security in Afghanistan and ?start winning? again, said one U.S. official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. ?
The new strategy, which has the backing of top Cabinet officials, would authorize the Pentagon, not the White House, to set troop numbers in Afghanistan and give the military far broader authority to use airstrikes to target Taliban militants. It would also lift Obama-era restrictions that limited the mobility of U.S. military advisers on the battlefield. ?
The net result of the changes would be to reverse moves by President Barack Obama to steadily limit the U.S. military role in Afghanistan, along with the risk to American troops and the cost of the war effort, more than 15 years after U.S. forces first arrived there. ?
Trump is expected to make a final call on the strategy before a May 25 NATO summit in Brussels that he plans to attend. ?
Officials said it is unclear whether Trump, who has spoken little about the United States? longest war, will look favourably upon expanding the U.S. role in Afghanistan. While he has voiced skepticism about allowing U.S. troops to become bogged down in foreign conflicts, the president has also expressed a desire to be tough on terrorism and has seemed to delight in the use of military force. ?
?The review is an opportunity to send a message that, yes, the U.S. is going to send more troops, but it?s not to achieve a forever military victory,? said Andrew Wilder, an Afghanistan expert at the U.S. Institute of Peace. ?Rather, it?s to try to bring about a negotiated end to this conflict.? ?
The new strategy is a product of the U.S. military?s mounting worries that the fragile stalemate with the Taliban has been steadily eroding for years, jeopardizing the survival of an allied government and endangering a key U.S. base for combating militant groups such as al-Qaida and the Islamic State throughout South Asia. ? Even as it moves to the president?s desk, the proposal faces resistance from some senior administration officials who fear a repeat of earlier decisions to intensify military efforts that produced only temporary improvements. ?
Inside the White House, those opposed to the plan have begun to refer derisively to the strategy as ?McMaster?s War,? a reference to H.R. McMaster, the president?s national security adviser. The general, who once led anti-corruption efforts in Afghanistan and was one of the architects of President George W. Bush?s troop surge in Iraq, is the driving force behind the new strategy at the White House. ?
The White House declined to comment. ?
The plan envisions an increase of at least 3,000 U.S. troops to an existing force of about 8,400. The U.S. force would also be bolstered by requests for matching troops from NATO nations. ? But, in keeping with the Trump administration?s desire to empower military decision-making, the Pentagon would have final say on troop levels and how those forces are employed on the battlefield. The plan would also increase spending on Afghanistan?s troubled government in an effort to improve its capacity. ? The additional troops and aid spending would add to the fiscal toll of a war that already costs $23 billion annually, a factor Trump advisers expect will weigh heavily in the president?s consideration of additional military actions. ?
In a break with the past, U.S. officials said that increases in U.S. troop levels and support to the Afghan government and military would be heavily conditioned on the ability of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, who heads a fragile unity government, to weed out ineffective military commanders and reduce corruption, both of which have led some aggrieved Afghans to turn to the Taliban as a better alternative. ?
The question at the heart of the new strategy is whether U.S. and Afghan forces, even if bolstered by new troops and authorities to target the Taliban, can create enough pressure to push the war toward a negotiated settlement. Those opposing the escalation have argued that even the Obama-era surge, which peaked at 100,000, did not result in Taliban concessions in on-again, off-again U.S.-Taliban talks begun in 2011. ?

Using Metta to bring about positive change
	
Happiness feels like such an elusive constituent of life. We seek it all the time. In Buddhism, the all-compassionate Buddha has laid out specific tools from which we can cultivate, nourish and propagate happiness, and this dramatically increases the quality of life of a person.?
In the book titled ?A heart as wide as the world,? author Sharon Salzberg says, ??from my earliest days of Buddhist practice, I felt perpetually drawn to the fact of finding a way of life that was characterised by peacefulness and authenticity. My own life at that time was largely characterised by fear and confusion. I felt separate from other people and from the world around me and even oddly disconnected from my own experience...? - These words certainly resonate how most people feel.?
Loving-kindness is the translation of the Pali word ?Metta.? The literal translation is friendship. Loving awareness is bringing love to all our actions, no matter what we are engaged in. Mindfulness infused with love and compassion bring happiness and ease. It is good to keep in mind that practicing Metta - or loving kindness or loving friendliness - towards others, greatly helps in alleviating those feelings of detachment and isolation we feel time-to-time. Loving awareness - being mindful about ourselves and holding ourselves with utmost love and compassion before we extend the same feelings to others - is vital. In general, most of the people feel fragmented and on their own.?
Metta is the recitation of a set of powerful words that evoke love towards others, beginning with oneself. It can go as follows:?
May I be happy.?
?May I be peaceful.?
?May I be at ease.?
?And extending it towards others:?
?May all people be happy.?
?May all people be peaceful.?
?May all people be at ease.?
?And finally extending it to all beings:?
?May all beings be happy.?
?May all beings be peaceful.?
?May all beings be at ease.?
As we cultivate Metta, the unwholesome mind may erupt with rage. At such times, we should momentarily focus on our breath and calm ourselves down, until it eventually passes away without any repercussion. We need more compassion towards ourselves and less judgments. Everyone goes through difficult times. It is natural. People go through delightful times as well. This is a sort of introspective reflection. With the cultivation of Metta, our lives become more fluid, meaning it flows smoothly. We are not detained by the same rut of disconnection or negative emotions like anger towards others. Instead, we are filled with love, tenderness and gentleness. Reacting negatively in problematic situations lead us to uneasiness and anxiety.?
When we begin the recitation of Metta, we might wonder as to how it could affect our lives. From what I have gathered, it can affect and even transform our lives in a profound manner. When we commence this expedition of introspective contemplation, we must bear in mind that things will get better, and it invariably does. We should, at all times, be positive because what goes around comes around -- love and Metta beget love and Metta.?
As we cultivate happiness, our lives become more peaceful, and that is a huge achievement, to live with ease. Sharon Salzberg describes happiness as an inner resource. Happiness coming from outside sources is rickety and temporary. When we cultivate Metta, we resonate with the whole of humanity. We begin to feel more sympathetic as well as empathetic.?
In school, nobody is taught how to be happy. Instead, we are taught, for instance, how to be productive citizens. Not that it is a bad thing. However, it is also important to be a happy individual. Happiness is something that needs cultivation. Reality is full of change. We can access different fractions of ourselves. Meditation, in my opinion, should be a subject taught in all schools. One does not need to be a Buddhist in order to meditate. It can be done by anyone, especially Metta or meditation of loving-kindness.?
We should not take things personally; that is another way of looking at life. When we are with other people, we must give them our undivided attention. We must learn to look at people, not simply through people. How we pay attention to one another and what we pay attention to matters a lot. After all, happiness is a skill.?
When we change our focus, we feel a difference. Our spirits elevate. We feel connected to others. If we shift the way we pay attention, the quality of resourcefulness like inner strength comes through. Nothing in life is a straight shot. Metta meditation can be called a love affair with life.?
Loving-kindness is a very important part of mindful-living and being happy in general. It is the art of friendship with us and also with others. All of life matters.?
Nalagiri was the name of the royal tusker that belonged to King Suppabuddha, father of Devadatta. Devadatta, who was jealous of Buddha, plotted to kill him while he was in Rajgir. They intoxicated this huge tusker, hurt and wounded it with spears. They irritated it so much so that it was enraged beyond compare. Later, they let it out loose from a special gate at Rajgir into the narrow streets where the Buddha was descending from alms round. The inebriate elephant then rampaged in the street, tearing down everything in its sight. While everyone ran helter-skelter when they saw the enraged elephant charging down the street, the Buddha and his faithful attendant Venerable Ananda Thera remained. Bhikkhu Ananda stood in front of the Buddha so that the elephant would get him instead of the Buddha. However, the Buddha came forward and with his immense Metta, relieved it of its pain and tamed it with tears running down his face, for the Buddha did not think about himself but of ending the suffering of the giant creature (source - http://gauthamabuddha.blogspot.com/2012/01/taming-elephant-with-loving-kindnes.html)?
Let me conclude in Sharon Salzberg?s words - ?Loving-kindness and compassionate love exist as a potential capacity within me. Other people may awaken or threaten it, but it is actually within me. Love is always there within me. The ability and capacity are always mine and always will be.??
Today is Vesak. The birth, enlightenment (Buddha hood), and demise (Parinirvana) of Lord Gautama Buddha. According to the Theravada, the tradition took place in sequence, on such a day as today.?
Lord Buddha taught the way of total and complete liberation, the transition from ignorance to wisdom, how to end suffering and realise the Supreme Bliss of Nirvana.?
What better day than today to joyously celebrate the Buddha?s birth and especially his remarkable teachings. Homage to the Blessed One. Sadhu. Sadhu. Sadhu.?
- With Metta, Namali.?

vesak Thoughts 2017
	
The Vesak full moon day dawns in early May this year. It is the most significant day for the Sri Lankan Buddhists since, time immoral in our Island?s history. The day is also significant for all other Buddhists the world. We revere this day as the ?Themagul Day of Shakyamuni?, the Blessed One for teaching us the absolute truth of human life on earth and what it entails, In a very logical manner to understand: in the form of just Four Noble Truths, pointing to the easily understandable facts of life - i.e. impermanence of life on earth and all that is physical and material in the world. Implicit in this profound teaching is the tenet of loving kindness for all beings on earth and peace for all. ??
Buddha, the noblest son of India, had visited Lanka three times during his lifetime. His teaching had a profound impact on this country from ancient times. The History records how the teaching of the Blessed One, were brought to Sri Lanka by the son of Emperor Asoka, the Ven. Arahath Mahinda Thera, to the then king of Sri Lanka, Devanampiya Tissa in a goodwill gesture and as an expression of Emperor?s friendship - love to the king.This was a momentous event in Sri Lanka?s history of all times. This was followed by his sister, Sangamiththa Therani, bringing to Lanka a sapling of the Bodhi Tree under which Buddha sat and attained Buddhahood in Gaya India. This was planted in Anuradhapura in the 3rd century BC by the king and has survived all these years and it is growing magnificently, drawing large crowds daily. These events were followed by many other arrivals of Buddha?s Sacred Relics, including the renowned Dantha Dhathu in subsequent periods during various kings of Sri Lanka. These gradually led to building of elegant temples, shrines and stupas across the country as places of worship of Buddha and his teaching. His noble teachings deeply touched the minds and hearts of people in Sri Lanka turning them in to devoted Buddhists, with an outlook of compassion that persists even today. ?
Upholding to teachings of Buddha under Lanka?s benevolent rulers led to establishment of a welfare state, perhaps the first in the world and unifying the country as a sovereign nation in the Island. It created a unique civilization to producing a culture of art, architecture and literature together with the developed language of quality and elegance.This was despite the Island?s size and limited resources. This fact has caught the attention of Oxford historian, Toynbee who then remarked it as a puzzle in world history. The Sinhalese under the influence of Buddhism used and turned, practically most natural rock caves and rock outcrops, that dotted the Island landscape into elegant temples and shrines, to blend harmoniously with the surrounding environment as places of worship and meditation for Buddhist bhikkus. Some of these places and ruins today can still touch the beholder?s spiritual sensitivity deeply. These places were maintained by the generous donations of various kings and people alike to serve then and to last for posterity. Most of them would have had rich treasures of some sort given by various rulers and rich devotees. Unfortunately however the country did not maintain and possess a standing army to protect and defend the riches and wealth of such places. Consequently Lanka became an easy victim to foreign robbers and conquerers, near and far throughout the country?s history. But as a nation and people we survived a part of rich heritage and Buddhist outlook. ??
Today as we celebrate the week of Vesak in the month of May 2017, it is spring time for most countries in the cold north, that bring flowers and fruits, we in Sri Lanka witness a rapidly changing techno - economy across the world. It is a world yearning for order, peace and happiness for all beings, but this is not forthcoming. Everywhere one finds greed exceeding fear resulting thereby suffering for most beings. Buddha focused on this very problem and logically explained to us that everything being impermanent in life on earth, why should man become so greedy and suffer, when a sense of moderation in mind and peace at heart cultivated by self realization can surely lead to a more satisfying state of affairs for men and nations alike. ??
May all being be?
well and happy ? ?

We condemn the Indian govt?s insistence to sign FTA?s: PNF
	
A letter was submitted to the Indian High Commission by the Professionals' National Front (PNF), condemning what was seen as the Indian government?s unwarranted influence on Sri Lanka to sign a new Free Trade Agreement with the South Asian giant.
In the letter submitted to the high commission yesterday the PNF said it was forced to oppose the move as the new FTA would not be advantageous to Sri Lanka. It further added that as professionals they were forced to oppose and condemn the Indian government?s insistence on Sri Lanka to sign the Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) which has generated strong opposition in our country.
?As professionals, we cannot agree on your government influencing the Sri Lankan government to enter into a new Free Trade Agreement (ETCA) to include Services in addition to Trade, without taking any tangible steps to solve the existing serious issues with the prevailing ISFTA,? the letter read.
The PNF went on to say that the Indo-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (ISFTA) which had already been signed between the countries was of no use to Sri Lankan exporters due to the non-tariff barriers (NTBs) that are operative through the State Governments of India.
?As a result, the trade balance between Sri Lanka and India has expanded exponentially over the years and the trade deficit has increased to more than $ 3.5 billion by year 2016.? it said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
