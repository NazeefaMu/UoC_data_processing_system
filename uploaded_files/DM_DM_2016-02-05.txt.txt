Appoint a competent AG soon, civil unions say
	
The National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ) today urged the government to immediately appoint a talented and independent person to the post of Attorney General which was vacated by acting AG Suhada Gamlath.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo, Professor Sarath Wijesuriya said that the legal institutions in the country were still not strong enough even though they had spoken several times to the President and the Prime Minister regarding this matter.
The request made by Cabinet to dissolve the Financial Crimes Investigation Department (FCID) cannot be accepted. The ones who made this request may be those who had engaged in these crimes. So, the Attorney Generals Department, which is the most important state unit to implement law, should be led by a very responsible person. In order for good governance to prevail, the Government should make legal institutions more powerful, said Professor Wijesuriya.
However, the NMSJ members praised the governments decision to sing the National anthem in Tamil during the Independence Day Ceremony which was held at the Galle Face Green on Thursday (4). (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

CDS moves into paperless digital settlements with LankaPay
	
Central Depository System (CDS), a fully-owned subsidiary of the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE), recently partnered with LankaPay, the national payment network, to provide a fully-fledged digital experience to its settlement banks via the CDS  Digitalized Settlement Schedule Signing (DS3) online portal.
This solution was enabled via LankaPays service arm, LankaSign, which is a trusted digital Certification Authority (CA) in Sri Lanka. LankaPay is now capable of providing comprehensive CA services, including digital signatures to the entire financial sector in Sri Lanka.
The CDS - DS3 solution enables CDS to eliminate physical placement of signatures previously required on the bank settlement schedules that were subsequently hand delivered in physical format to the respective banks on a daily basis. This process caused significant information risk and delays in the entire settlement process, which created a requirement for a more secure and faster solution.
With the new solution provided by LankaPay, the CDS signatories can simply sign the settlement schedules using LankaSign digital certificates and upload the same instantly onto the CDS - DS3 portal to be accessed by the respective settlement bank. The LankaSign digital certificates are embedded in USB Crypto Tokens that enable two-factor authentication facilitating secure data transmission. This process ensures that both CDS and settlement banks use the established secure connectivity prior to any data transmission and that data is not altered during the transmission. 
CSE CEO Rajeeva Bandaranaike commenting on the initiative said, This product has made a significant change to one of the key CDS processes, which is settlement coordination with the four settlement banks. It has automated the settlement process, making it very much efficient by eliminating paper-based work. Further, it has also given the opportunity for CDS to explore possibilities of streamlining the other processes within the same platform.
Applauding the partnership, LankaClear GM/CEO Channa de Silva stated, We are indeed honoured to be associated with yet another futuristic solution of CDS with the support of the CSE. LankaPay has revolutionized the ICT industry in Sri Lanka by establishing LankaSign, the first CA in Sri Lanka, primarily targeting the financial sector. In a day and age where information security is of paramount importance, we endeavour to partner with more institutions across many sectors to use cost-effective digital certificate-based solutions for greater autonomy and information security. This will enable customer-focused local service support while bringing down the overheads associated with managing physical documents, paving the way for a paperless environment.

El Nino has intensified dry spell: Met Dept.
	
The current dry spell experienced in the country is a result of the EL Nino phenomenon, the Department of Meteorology said yesterday.
A duty forecaster from the Department told the Daily Mirror that the dry weather normally prevailed at this time of the year brought on by the dry winds which blows from the North but said it had intensified this year as a result of the El Nino.
El Nio is a climate pattern that describes the unusual warming of surface waters in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. El Nino is the warm phase of a larger phenomenon called the El Nino-Southern Oscillation
The department said there had been no rainfall in any part of the country during the past few days.
The temperature in most parts of the country was high with the highest temperature of 35.5c degrees reported from Colombo and 35.4c degrees reported from Katunayake while the temperatures in Hambantota, Kurunegala, Ratnapura and Ratmalana were more than 33c degrees.

I didn't influence Embilipitiya widow: Ven. Omalpe Thera
	
Rejecting allegations that Ven. Omalpe Sobitha Thera influenced the widow of Embilipitiya man, who died in a fall, by giving her money, the Thera said he only tried to help the woman after a donor from England offered to donate money to the victims family.
Ven. Sobitha Thera said a donor, Udaya Peiris, who lives in England, had asked the thera over the phone whether he could help the Embilipitiya victims family after which the thera mediated to help them.
Udaya Peiris, a donor known to me, asked me if I could help him to get a cash donation sent over to the widow, considering her situation. When I offered to do so he gave me Rs. 45,000 to be given to her. Then I asked a social worker and a journalist, Chandima Kodituwakku, to find out whether the widow of the man who was killed in Embilipitiya needed the donation and if so to make arrangements to hand it over to her. After contacting the woman, Ms. Kodituwakku told me the victim was in a position to receive the donation. But we could not offer it to her until February 3 as the donor, Mr. Peiris, was not in a position to travel to Embilipitiya to make the donation and it got delayed, the thera said.
The thera said he was surprised to hear a lawyer on February 3 say that I offered money to the woman and influenced her not to act against the police as what i just explained is what really took place.
Ven. Sobitha Thera told a news conference he did not know on what grounds such an allegation was made and he did not try to influence the victimised woman not to act against the police. The thera said he was engaged in charity throughout the country and that was not the first incident of such a nature.
Ven. Sobitha Thera requested the police chief to conduct an investigation into the incident and reveal the truth to the country. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Jet crew suspended for letting Sonu Nigam sing on a flight
	
`Jet Airways has suspended the crew of a flight for letting Indian Singer Sonu Nigam, 42, use the public announcement system on a plane for an impromptu concert,Indian media reported today.
Passengers of a chartered flight were pleasantly surprised when Sonu Nigam gave an impromptu performance on the planes address system recently.
The flight, however, didnt end well for the flights crew after the Directorate General of Civil Aviation took a strict view of the performance and asked the airline to take action.
The regulatory body pushed the airline to ground the five flight attendants who allowed the concert to go on.
In a statement, Jet Airways said all cabin crew on the flight have been taken off from flight duty for enquiry and corrective training to reinforce strict adherence to operating procedure. It also added that the flight announcement system was allegedly misused wherein singer Sonu Nigam was allowed to sing from the planes address system.
The in-flight concert allegedly took place on a flight from Jodhpur to Mumbai on January 4. According to reports, the passengers aboard the flight were returning from a wedding and knew each other. They requested Nigam to croon some of his hits and the singer obliged.
He sang two songs  Do pal ruka from Yash Raj Films Veer Zaara and Panchhi nadiya from Abhishek Bachchans Refugee  on the flights address system.
When he noticed that plane passengers were also singing along, he said, Arrey wah, aap bhi gaatein hain. My God, saare singers hain. Some of the passengers made videos which found their way to Facebook and went viral.
This was not the first incident of this kind. As a part of Holi celebrations in 2014, the cabin crew of SpiceJet broke into a dance sequence mid-air to the tune of Balam Pichkari. This act led to the suspension of two pilots and DGCA issuing show cause notice to the airline.

Magistrate wants medical report on Sicille Kotalawela
	
Court today directed the Durdans Hospital Director to provide a detailed medical report by February 8 as to why Lalith Kotalawela's wife Sicille, who faces charges of misappropriating Rs.4.3 billion at F&G Property Developers, should be treated at a private hospital and not at the Colombo National Hospital.
The directive was issued by Colombo Chief Magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya under Section 124 of the Criminal Procedure Code in the wake of a motion filed by the CID. The Magistrate also directed the hospital to submit a report on the history of the suspects illness.
The CID is reported to have admitted the suspect to Durdan's Hospital on the request of the suspect and her specialist doctor. She was arrested on arrival at the BIA.
The Magistrate directed the CID to get appropriate orders on the suspect from the Fort Magistrate in the two cases -- B499/2009 and B107/09, because the hospital is beyond the jurisdiction of the Chief Magistrate.
Sicille Kotalawela is the eighth suspect in the inquiry into the alleged misappropriation of Rs.4.3 billion at F&G Property Developers.
The case was postponed for February 11. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Neville F'do Hospital offered to Govt. by chairman
	
The Chairman of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malabe, Dr. Neville Fernando yesterday said he offered the Dr. Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital to President Maithripala Sirisena to be used as a semi-government hospital.
He said the decision was made by him after realizing that poor patients, who come for treatment to his hospital, could not afford to pay for hospital charges.
The President was recently informed by Dr. Fernando regarding his offer through a letter, however he said the President had not yet responded to it. Dr. Fernando said the letter had been forwarded to the Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne by the President.
He said at the moment, the ministry was going through the proposal made by him, and it might take some time for them to make a final decision on the matter.
I built the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital and equipped it with all the modern hi-tech equipment. This includes 6 surgical theatres, with one having a camera in the light and which could be focused on the site of the surgery and the picture telecast to the lecture hall where the students are seated. The 1000 bed hospital was constructed at an investment of Rs. 2000 million for the use of students, Dr. Fernando said.
When I realized that poor patients who come for treatment cannot afford to pay, I offered the hospital to the President to use it as a semi-government hospital. I also offered to pay the salaries of the professors and the senior consultants. The proposal was mine and in the best interest of the students, he added. (Piyumi Fonseka)
