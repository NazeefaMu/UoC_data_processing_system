Combank sets digital banking record in 2017 with Rs.663 bn in transactions
	

A whopping Rs.662.95 billion was transacted through digital banking channels alone, by customers of the Commercial Bank of Ceylon in 2017.
This is the highest value the bank has handled digitally in a single year since the launch of its mobile and online banking platforms, which make up its anytime, anywhere digital banking offering.
The remarkable growth in the use of these channels was reflected in an increase of 31.31 percent in digital transaction values, and a 16.45 percent increase in the number of digital transactions conducted in 2017 over the previous year, the bank said.
The value of online banking transactions increased by Rs.155.8 billion in 2017, while mobile banking transactions recorded an increase of Rs.2.28 billion, leading to a Rs.158.08 billion increase in total digital transaction values.

Our success in digital banking is based on the depth of the effort taken to understand customer requirements and to offer the fastest, most secure and most user-friendly solutions to cater to those needs. Commercial Bank was recognised as the Best Digital Bank in Sri Lanka, and was also presented the award for the Best Mobile Application in Sri Lanka in 2017 by the prestigious London-based World Finance magazine for its success in this sphere.

## Title: Concerns raised over tab tender precedure Questions raised regarding Education Ministry procedure
## Section: Expose

Concerns raised over tab tender precedure Questions raised regarding Education Ministry procedure
	
Following the ruling partys defeat at the Local Government Elections, which is linked to the failure in putting a stop to bribery and corruption within the Government, it has now come to light that the Education Ministry Officials have violated a tender procedure. 
Top Education Ministry officials are alleged to have violated procurement guidelines to procure computer tabs for Advanced Level students and teachers in favour of a particular bidder. Further revelations show how pressure had been mounted on the Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC) to recommend this particular bidder who has failed to comply with the tender specifications. 
It is alleged that the TEC, appointed to procure tabs for A/L students and teachers, had come under severe pressure from higher rankers at the Ministry of Education. This pressure was applied on the committee to force it to recommend a brand that doesnt have the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) certification, which guarantees the health safety of the users- the A/L students in the country. 
There are three levels of FCC standardization. They are verification, conformity and certification. The FCC verification and conformity are issued to devices that do not intentionally transmit radio frequency (RF) radiation. The verification and conformity documents are retained by the manufacturer and describe how the device confirms to the technical standards. The FCC certification is required for all devices that include wireless transmitters/ receivers. Its reported that prolonged exposure to RF has an impact on the nervous system and brain activity of humans effecting memory, learning and male fertility. Although these tablet devices are to given to school children, the Education Ministrys proposal to award the tender to the bidder, whose devices do not have all required internationally accepted safety standards for human health in order to protect the health and well-being of the A/L students, has raised concern among officials at the Ministry of Education. 
Although the TEC had submitted their report to the Standing Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee (SCAPC) recommending one bidder that had complied all procurement specification required to be awarded the tender, Secretary to the Cabinet of Ministers based on a cabinet decision on December 19, 2017, had directed Secretary Education Ministry to re-evaluate four bidders that had been rejected by the TEC but recommended by the Procurement Appeal Board (PAB). 
The TEC members had no other option, but to act on the Cabinet of Ministers directives to choose a bidder out of four that was rejected by them earlier
Following this directive, six out of the nine member of the TEC on January 3, 2018, gave their recommendations to award the tender to Abans PLC to supply Lenovo brand computer tabs. However by a letter dated January 12, 2018, two of them -Chief Accountant Education Ministry, J.K.N.S. Perera and Assistant Director of Education W.A.S.W. Wijesuriya had written to the Chairman Standing Cabinet Appoint Procurement Committee (SCAPC) stating that they should withdraw consent they gave on January 3, 2013. 
In the letter, Perera and Wijesuriya further state that although they evaluated and ranked only four bids recommended by the PAB and approved by the Cabinet of Ministers (17/ 2913/ 742/ 049/TBR), based on the durability and health safety standards of the devices, after re-considering the evaluation process, they had decided to withdraw the consent given as the selected device does not meet internationally accepted safety standards of human health. 
Meanwhile two more members of the TEC- Director Finance Ministry Tharanga Liyanage and Assistant Director Education W.S.S. Dissanayake in another letter dated January 11, 2018 had stated how irregular it is to evaluate and rank only four bidders that have not complied tender specifications.
They further state that the way these four bidders have been chosen for final consideration is questionable as the earlier TEC report has given every detail as to why they have been rejected. 
Questionable procurement 
In the meantime it is learned as to how the cabinet of ministers had disregarded the observations made by the Minister of Finance and Mass Media in his Cabinet Memorandum dated December 18, 2017 with regard to the questionable procurement. 
Minister of Finance and Mass Media in his cabinet memorandum states that the Ministry of Education should cancel the procurement and call for fresh tenders. 
The observations made by the Finance Minister states the following: Considering the following aspects, it is appropriate for the Ministry of Education to cancel this procurement and call for fresh tenders. 
(i) The Standing Cabinet Appoint Procurement Committee (SCAPC) has recommended M/s metropolitan Computers (Pvt) Ltd being the lowest evaluated substantially responsive bidder whereas the Procurement Appeal Board (PAB) has recommended Abans PLC as the lowest bidder. 
(ii) The TEC has rejected the bids of the Abans PLC as the device submitted by them has critical departures from the technical specifications as against the requirements in the bidding document (major deviation). 
(iii) Seven bidders out of ten had submitted appeals against the SCAPC recommendation to award the contract. 
(iv) During the bid evaluation period the composition of the TEC had been reconstituted several times. 
Therefore, I propose that the Ministry of Education should initiate a new procurement process in this regard with a comprehensive bidding document covering all aspects highlighted, to avoid various ambiguities reported in the present tender which is proposed to be cancelled.
Subsequent to Finance Ministers observations, Secretary to the Cabinet of Ministers, S. Abeysinghe by letter December 22, 2017 to Secretary Ministry of Education Sunil Hettiarachchi had instructed the latter to grant approval to take action as per the recommendation indicated under sub-paragraph 3.2 of the Education Ministry Cabinet Memorandum and to take action as per the decision above (sub-paragraph 3.2) and submit the outcome to the Cabinet, through the Minister for consideration. The letter further states that the cabinet of ministers has decided to treat this decision as confirmed and to convey the cabinet decision to the relevant authorities for necessary action accordingly. 
(Sub-paragraph 3.2 of the Education Ministry Cabinet Memorandum refers as thus, As recommended by the PAB, to refer the four bidders to the TEC along with the selected bidder and to consider the standards of their devices once again). 
However, to the dismay of the Education Ministry officers, instead of evaluating the initially selected bidder- Metropolitan Computers together with the other four bidders that were earlier rejected, the TEC on January 3, 2018 re-evaluated only Abans PLC (Haier brand), EW Information Systems Ltd (EWIS brand), Abans PLC (Lenovo brand) and Softlogic Retail Pvt Ltd (MaxMo brand) but not Metropolitan Computers. 
The TEC members had no other option, but to act on the Cabinet of Ministers directives to choose a bidder out of four that was rejected by them earlier, Education Ministry sources said on condition of anonymity. 
Favoured bidder
According to the sources, attempts taken by the Education Ministry higher officials to influence the TEC to select one of their favoured bidders from the inception had failed. This has led the Secretary Education Ministry to make a request to the Department of Public Finance to appoint new members to the TEC which had been turned down. 
Failing to influence the TEC members, by letter dated July 12, 2017, Secretary Education Ministry (Ref:ED/07/101/10/PRO/CAPC/2017) had made a request to the Department of Public Finance to appoint new members to the TEC. However turning down the request, by letter dated July 24, 2017, Director General Department of Public Finance P. Algama had written to Secretary Ministry of Education that the request made by him to replace the TEC with new members shall bring negative impact on the credibility and transparency of the Government procurement procedure and instead he could appoint more members to the committee. 
The letter further states, For the procurement of free tabs for AL teachers and students, I have already appointed seven members to the TEC by letter dated March 3, 2017, and without giving any reasons you have made a request to null and void the appointed TEC. 
The TEC had already followed the procurement guidelines and had called for tenders. Hence to remove the members of the TEC at this juncture, shall bring negative impact on the credibility and transparency of the Government procurement procedure. If you need to strengthen the TEC, could consider to appoint more members to the committee. 
Following this directive, six out of the nine member of the TEC on January 3, 2018, gave their recommendations to award the tender to Abans PLC to supply Lenovo brand computer tabs
Although the TEC repeatedly refused to give approval to a brand that does not have the FCC product certification, the PAB for unknown reasons recommended to the Cabinet of Ministers to set aside the recommendations of the SCAPC to award the tender to M/s Metropolitan Computers and to award the tender to Abans PLC since the latter has fulfilled all major conditions of the tender. 
The PAB in its report states that Abans PLC (Haier), E-W Information Systems Limited (EWIS), Abans PLC (Lenovo) and Softlogic Retail (Pvt) Ltd (MAXMO) have fulfilled all tender conditions sufficiently (as indicated under each hearing of appeals) for the final consideration for the award of this tender. 
Technical specifications of critical nature
How could the three member PAB headed by K.A.S. Gunasekera, Lalith R. de Silva and A.D.S. Gunawardena recommend the above four bidders to be evaluated for the final consideration claiming they have fulfilled all tender conditions sufficiently, when the TEC report says that Abans PLC (Haier brand) that the FCC product certification they have submitted is for a different model not for the sample provided which violates procurement guidelines 7.8.4. For Abans (Lenovo brand) too has provided only partial FCC modular certificationand the product does not seems to have approval for Bluetooth radiation although the wireless module is integrated with WiFi and Bluetooth. E-W Information too has not provided the FCC product certification as required and the name of the manufacturer of the device could not be verified during hardware inspection and could not verify the technical specifications of critical nature. It was the same with Softlogic Retails. They have not only failed to provide the FCC production certification, but the FCC ID provided was given for a different model, but not for the quoted brand. The name of the manufacturer of the device cannot be verified during hardware inspection. As such the TEC was unable to verify the manufacturers authorization letter given by the bidder. Considering these aspects, what made the PAB to recommend these for bidders for the final evaluation alleged the sources. 
After a detailed evaluation of the bid documents received together with the sample devices and the casings that were provided, independent verifications from relevant standardizing authorities, technical specifications and inspection of hardware configuration, Metropolitan Computers and Abans PLC was selected for further evaluation. However, as the Lenovo brand has provided only FCC modular certification, the Education Ministry by taking a step further had written to Abans PLC on September 28, 2017 seeking for further clarification with respect to Bluetooth radiation of Lenovo MiiX 320 tablet. 
By letters dated October 6, 2017 and October 9, 2017,Abans PLC had submitted further updates on the wireless component of the Lenovo MiiX 320. At the time the bids were opened Abans had submitted Qualcomm FCC modular certification, but when the device was inspected, the TEC found out the particular device has Intel wi-fi module which was a major deviation and would have rejected the bid at the first round itself. However later, on the request of the Secretary Education Ministry, Abans PLC was allowed to change the originally submitted FCC modular certification along with the wi-fi module.This is against the guidelines of the Government procurement manual 2006. According to section 7.9.7 of the procurement manual, there may be a need to seek clarification from a bidder with the sole purpose of ensuring that the bid can be properly and fairly evaluated, but should not permit any substantive change to the bidders initial response, sources further added. 
Subsequent to the clarifications Education Ministry received from Abans, the SCAPC wanted the TEC to further evaluate the clarifications submitted for the Lenovo brand. TEC report dated October 10, 2017, once again had recommended the devise submitted by Metropolitan Computers as it has FCC product certification for radio frequency exposure safety standard of the devices. 
The TEC report further states, The documents submitted by Abans PLC on October 6, 2017 contains an FCCID that is not compatible with the network module in the sample device provided. The second submission submitted by Abans PLC on October 9, 2017 contains the FCCID network module inside the device. 
The tablet device submitted by Abans PLC (Lenovo MiiX-320) has FCC modular certification for the device, while the device submitted by Metropolitan (Acer S1003) has FCC product certification for radio frequency exposure safety standards of the devices. 
According to FCC certification guidelines, Product Certification and Modular Certification of the FCC Certification grant differ in the following manner. 
If the device has the FCC Product Certification, the manufacturer of the device is legally responsible for health safety standards whereas if the device has FCC Modular Certification, the network card manufacturer is legally responsible of the health safety standard of the module. In the latter scenario, the manufacturer of the tablet device is not legally responsible to maintain health safety standards of the device. As the device will be procured by the Ministry of Education from the manufacturer, it is important that the device complies with Product Certification as required in the original technical certification. 
No necessity to select bidder based on safety standard
-Education Ministry Secretary
Secretary Ministry of Education, Sunil Hettiarachchi when contacted told the Daily Mirror that there is no necessity to select a bidder based on the safety standard of the devices but should be on the prices which is affordable. 
When asked as to why in the tender document, the SCAPC requested the bidders to submit the FCC Certification, if the safety standard should not be considered when awarding the tender, Hettiarachchi inquired as to whether this newspaper too is using mobile phones that has the FCC Certification If you do not consider whether the mobile you are using has the FCC Certification why do you want to know as to why the Education Ministry is not considering the FCC Certification when awarding the tender to procure computer tabs. Mind you, these tabs are given free of charge for the children and teachers.The device we are going to purchase is the lowest and well within our budget, Hettiarachchi said. 
Although when questioned as to why he sought further clarification from Abans PLC after the tender was opened by permitting the bidder to make substantive changes to the initial bid documents that have been submitted which is against Government procurement guidelines, Hettiarachchi stopped the telephone conversation abruptly. 
Response from Abans
When contacted Assistant Sales Manager, Computer Corporate Sales Division, Abans PLC, Mahesh Perera who corresponded with the Secretary Education Ministry to find out why they submitted Qualcomm FCC modular certificate along with the bid when the wi-fi module that was in the device was different to what they have stated in the bid, Perera wanted this newspaper to contact the Pre-sales Engineer for any comment. 
However the Pre-Sales Engineer too did not wish to make any comment and wanted this newspaper to contact General Manager Chatura Jayawardena for details. All attempts taken to contact Jayawardena failed as Abans PLC did not give personal contact details of Jayawardena until the paper went for publication.

Dhammika Perera picks up last of worlds 50 Bentley Mulsanne Hallmarks
	
Dhammika Perera, the richest business leader in Sri Lanka, has taken delivery of his prized - and perhaps the first in the South and Southeast Asia or the Middle East Bentley Mulsanne Hallmark, worth around Rs. 160 million, inclusive of import duty. 
The car, the single most expensive sedan in the world, is inspired by precious metals and luxurious materials used by renowned master jewellers.
The Mulsanne Hallmark Series by Mulliner is limited to a production run of just 50 handcrafted cars, making each one as rare and sought-after as the elements that inspired its creation.
Dhammikas purchase of the Blue and Porcelain White new Mulsanne Hallmark was the 50th and had arrived by air freight yesterday.
Apart from the West, there are only three such Mulsanne Hallmark Series units in Asia i.e. China. The catalogue price is Sterling Pounds 390,000 (around Rs. 84 million) and the duty on the dream machine is a staggering Rs. 76 million, according to Sri Lanka Custom sources.
Created for visionaries with the power to turn their ideas into reality, the Bentley Mulsanne is the flagship model of the Bentley range. It is much more than a luxury sedan - a pure expression of phenomenal performance and the pinnacle of exquisite luxury. The worlds finest handmade car represents the ultimate combination of both luxury and performance.
The car features exquisite design details from Mulliner  Bentleys personal commissioning division. This includes: a Hallmarked silver or 23.9 carat-gold-plated Flying B mascot, a matching fine line running the length of the body, silver or gold metallic hide lining the storage compartments, complementary painted veneer and a stunning precious metal veneer inlay.
Exquisite in the extreme, the Mulsanne Hallmark Series represents a glittering addition to the Mulsanne range  and a collectors item in waiting.
According to the Bentley website, the famous retractable Flying B mascot is engraved with Commissioned on one side and By Mulliner on the other, and is hewn either from solid silver (featuring the Bentley hallmark) or finished with carat-gold plating.
Both models feature an exquisite hand painted fine line running the length of the coachwork, in either gold or silver. Single or duo-tone paint finishes are available with the Hallmark Series by Mulliner. Imposing 21 polished alloy wheels and the distinct Mulliner grille create the ultimate statement of luxury. Additionally, the beautifully intricate new Serenity grille is also available as an option.
Inside, the Mulsanne Hallmark Series by Mulliner features front and rear seats trimmed in contrasting hides, to create a bespoke colour split. Stunning silver or gold embroidery and piping complete the exclusive interior design.
Unique metallic silver or gold hide lines the Hidden Delights storage spaces, inspired by the tailoring for the very best Savile Row suits. The hide on the seats and door panels has the delicate Mulliner quilting pattern, while the veneer is painted to perfectly match the secondary hide colour, creating a considered and elegant interior inspired by current interior design trends. The fascia has a silver or gold overlay with a Mulliner inscription, and there are silver or gold-plated inlays on all door waistrails.
Alcantara rear cushions matching the secondary hide, illuminated treadplates bearing the word Hallmark and stainless steel plaques engraved with 1 of 50 complete the truly extraordinary interior of the new limited edition Mulsanne Hallmark Series. (Daily FT)

HNB recognised for innovation in microfinance at IFM Awards
	
Extending a winning legacy that spans over 29 years in the field, HNB won the award for Most Innovative Microfinance Bank in Sri Lanka, at the recently concluded International Finance Magazine Awards (IFM) 2017 in Singapore.
Organised by International Finance Magazine with a view to celebrating individuals and organisations in the international finance industry that have had a significant impact in their respective markets through an emphasis on value addition and innovation, this years awards drew extensive participation from among Asia Pacifics most respected industry leaders.
Following a stringent round of evaluations, HNB was presented with the award for innovation in microfinance, in recognition of its remarkable, holistic efforts to extend vibrant and genuinely valuable microfinance services to the widest possible spectrum of customers in Sri Lanka.
A substantial proportion of Sri Lankas economy is built on the efforts of microfinance entrepreneurs and SMEs, and we remain confident in the ability of this sector to serve as an engine of unprecedented growth, provided they are facilitated with the necessary access to finance, knowledge, skills and other advisory services for such businesses to thrive. HNBs approach prioritises the early identification of promising businesses with a view to forming lasting partnerships capable of unleashing and sustaining growth at every stage of the business.
This award therefore stands as further vindication of HNBs tried and tested approach to microfinance and we wish to express our heartfelt gratitude to our dedicated team of employees and field officers who have been at the heart of our success, stated HNB SME and Midmarket Deputy General Manager Jude Fernando.
Standing as the very first Sri Lankan bank to enter the market with a branded product exclusively for the microfinance sector with HNB Gami Pubuduwa in 1989, the bank has utilised its invaluable experience as a true pioneer in the field to extend vital financial services to underserved communities across the island, while tailoring its approach to suite the unique conditions prevalent in the Sri Lankan market.
Coupled with an extensive emphasis on value addition, including microfinance loans bundled with life insurance cover, rural financial awareness building programmes, and the linking of rural entrepreneurs with export markets across the globe through ground breaking initiatives like HNB Avurudu Pola, HNBs innovative microfinance model continues to set new benchmarks in the Sri Lankan market.
Today there is a great deal of innovation and highly marketable products being created in Sri Lankas rural economy, however the main constraints that these businesses face is with regard to a lack of finance, technical expertise and exposure to consumers. In order to add value we have primarily focused on these areas, all based on a foundation of trust that is grown organically between our customers and our 150 field officers who are in constant contact with these businesses, Fernando elaborated.
In addition to working directly with individuals, businesses and communities across the island, HNB has also partnered with reputed microfinance providers like Sarvodaya Development Finance and Berendina Microfinance to arrange lines of funding that are subsequently extended to micro entrepreneurs.
Similarly, the bank works with e-commerce facilitators like local firm WebXpay and international e-commerce market, Alibaba.com, to help introduce and improve exposure for rural entrepreneurs among an entirely new and previously untapped demographic of consumers while also providing export credit facilities for those enterprises that succeed in these new markets. Moving forward, Fernando reiterated HNBs commitment towards delivering the optimal mix of microfinance and value-added services, which the bank plans to further augment utilising new technologies that will help bridge the gap and unleash a new wave of growth into Sri Lankas rural economy.

Inter-University Students' Federation (IUSF) Convener Lahiru Weerasekara and Inter University Bhikkhus Federation (IUBF) Convener Tempitiye Sugathananda Thera were remanded till February 28 by Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne today on charges of disobeying previous court orders and causing a public nuisance by holding a protest at the Kollupitiya junction on January 25, 2018 during Local Government elections.
The Police said the protesters had forcibly attempted to enter the Temple Trees.
The Magistrate observed that protesters had caused a huge traffic jam and were a public nuisance.
The police said that they had publicly announced the previous court order on not causing a public nuisance but the protesters continued to ignore it.
The two suspects had appeared in the Fort Magistrate's Court in connection with another case, but were directed by the police to stay back for the case on the protest because they were suspects in this case as well. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Jacob Zuma quits as President of South Africa
	
Jacob Zuma resigned as President of South Africa on Wednesday, heeding orders by the ruling African National Congress (ANC) to bring an end to his nine scandal-plagued years in power.
In a 30-minute farewell address to the nation, 75-year-old Zuma said he disagreed with the way the ANC had shoved him towards an early exit after the election of Cyril Ramaphosa as party president in December, but would accept its orders.
I have therefore come to the decision to resign as president of the republic with immediate effect, Zuma said.
Even though I disagree with the decision of the leadership of my organisation, I have always been a disciplined member of the ANC, he said.
The ruling party had said it would vote him out on Thursday.
No life should be lost in my name. And also the ANC should not be divided in my name, Zuma said.
The ANC, which replaced Zuma as party leader in December with Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, ordered him to step down as president on Tuesday. When he failed to resign on Wednesday, it announced that it would back an opposition motion in parliament to force him out.
His resignation ends the career of the former anti-apartheid resistance fighter, 75, who has four wives, a sharp tongue and a decades-long history of entanglement in scandals that polarised Nelson Mandela's Rainbow Nation.
The rand currency, which has gained ground whenever Zuma has hit political turbulence, soared more than one percent to a 2-1/2 year high of 11.79 against the dollar during the day, as pressure piled on Zuma to resign. (REUTERS)

JVP undecided whether to support: If resolution brought in to dissolve parliament
	
Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said today let anyone bring in a resolution to dissolve parliament, then they would decide what to do.
In response to a question what stance the JVP would take if a resolution was brought in to dissolve Parliament, he said Let them bring it in first. We do not need to get excited on this. We are sure they will not bring in such a resolution, he said.
He told a news conference that according to the 19th Amendment, President had no power to dissolve parliament until February, 2020 and added that it could be done only through a resolution with a two-thirds majority.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and MP Chamal Rajapaksa had asked to dissolve parliament and announce a general election. Whom are they requesting to do so It is the parliament that had the power to dissolve it. Both of them are in parliament. They can bring it if they want to do so, he said.
He said they could not accept the claims that parliament should be dissolved following the Local Government election results and added that it should be done only when the country was in a politically unstable situation.
It is not practical to dissolve parliament based on the results of an election. Then after every election, they would ask to dissolve parliament, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

17 killed in shooting at South Florida high school
	
A 19-year-old former student armed with an AR-15 opened fire inside a South Florida high school on Wednesday, police said, killing at least 17 people in the latest burst of deadly violence to erupt inside an American school.
The shooting sparked a brief, intense manhunt across the quiet suburban community of Parkland, Fla., locking teachers and students huddled inside classrooms until officers captured the young man they said had gunned down his former peers.
A dozen people were killed inside the school, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel told reporters Wednesday evening. Three more died outside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, while two others died at area hospitals. Others wounded in the shooting were still undergoing surgery, he said.
Its a horrific, horrific day, said Israel, noting that his triplets had graduated from the same school where the shooting occurred.
The shooting was the latest in a long line of violent attacks that have shattered the peace inside schools, movie theaters, churches, offices and other public places. Once again, bullets tore through school hallways as students and teachers sought shelter. Once again, lives were cut short and others irrevocably, painfully changed. Once again, the nation watched with horror as they again confronted the unthinkable.
For Israels department, the shooting at Douglas marked the second time in a little over a year that they have responded to a mass shooting. In January 2017, Broward Sheriffs deputies rushed to Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport to respond to a gunman who got off of a plane, pulled out a gun and began firing at other travelers, killing five people.
Authorities said the Valentines Day rampage at Douglas began outside the building before the gunman headed inside not long before classes were to be dismissed for the day. Police identified the suspected gunman as Nikolaus Cruz, 19, and said he had been a Douglas student who was expelled for unspecified disciplinary reasons. (Police also spelled his first name as Nikolas.)
Its just catastrophic, Israel told reporters at a news briefing. There really are no words.
It was possible Cruz may have also attended J.P. Taravella High School, which is not far from Douglas, but that was not clear, Israel said.
Police did not immediately detail a possible motivation for the shooting. Investigators have begun digging into Cruzs activities online and on social media, and what they found so far was very, very disturbing, Israel said, though he did not elaborate. (Washington Post)

## Section: News Features

Late Anura Bandaranaikes 69th Birth Anniversary falls today A clean leader with a great vision
	
Anura Bandaranaike was a leader who lent colour to the political scene in Sri Lanka. He was one of those possessed of excellent personal qualities, superior intelligence and a very clear vision. He was an unrivalled orator in Parliament. His level of eloquence in both the Sinhala andEnglish languages was extremely high.
With the unanimous agreement of all Members of Parliament, Anura Bandaranaike reached the highest office in Parliament, that of the Speaker
	In the 1970 General Elections, he directed the entire campaign in the Attangalla electorate single-handedly
	He secured 49000 votes in Nuwara Eliya-Maskeliya electorate and was elected second MP, pushing Thondaman to third place
He marshalled his vast vocabulary meaningfully, logically and appropriately, often using an apt quotation from Shakespeare or other reputed authors, to make his point. He was an embodiment of a sharp intellect, ability, honesty, organizational skill and cordiality towards his associates. He acquired an honours degree in history in 1973 from a British university. He had a deep knowledge of western and eastern history, literature, political philosophy, economics, and international relations. He also had an unquenchable thirst for new knowledge. His personal library lacked nothing in modern local and foreign books.
Whenever he could spare the time in Parliament, he had the habit of perusing the valuable books and other documents found in its library. He had the unique ability to make use of the knowledge thus acquired, logically and critically, when required. The great majority of those in politics in the present day do not have that ability. In fact even a child who observes the present day goings-on in Parliament would realize that the majority in Parliament today are persons with vacant minds. In contrast, the likes of Anura Bandaranaike brought lustre to Parliament.
Anura Bandaranaike had clean hands, unsoiled by corruption, terrorism and man slaughter. He was in the fullest sense of the term, a clean leader. Even his opponents acknowledged that without any hesitation. He received the peoples affection and acceptance, in full measure, in the city and the village, from childhood. He had a physical presence which made any one who looked at him once, to look again. He had the good fortune to enjoy the close association of the most powerful world leaders, from his childhood. 
Anura Bandaranaike had clean hands, unsoiled by corruption, terrorism and man slaughter. He was in the fullest sense of the term, a clean leader. Even his opponents acknowledged that without any hesitation. He received the peoples affection and acceptance, in full measure, in the city and the village, from childhood
Most leaders now have forgotten the priceless service he rendered to the SLFP even from his school days, i.e. from 1965. From that time he participated directly in every election campaign and contributed his might to the advancement of the party. Old time party members even now recall with gratitude the way he traversed over hill and dale, meeting the rural folk, all the time advancing the party cause. At the same time he identified talented young people in distant villages, brought them in to the party fold and helped them along to the highest levels of the party hierarchy. Today they shine at the highest levels.
Most people have now forgotten this. In the 1970 General Elections, he directed the entire campaign in the Attangalla electorate single-handed, whilst pursuing his university education. He had to do so as both his sisters were abroad. Mr. Bandaranaike who was only 21 years of age at the time, secured Attanagalla for the SLFP with a majority of 21,000 votes. I would like it to be recalled that Sirimavo Bandaranaike had not up to then secured such a large majority at Attanagalla. In addition, his addressing at campaign meetings all round the country at that election, contributed immensely to the United Front victory in that election. While pursuing university education in Britain during the period 1970- 74, he came back to the country during every by-election and conducted the party campaigns. 
The fact that Anura was able to generate a youth wave in favour of the party as a youth leader, since his return to the country in 1974, even in the context of a situation where the partys popularity was in the wane, is testimony to his ability. At every meeting and every seminar he attended there were huge crowds. The 1976 Ja-ela by-election took place in a back ground where the United Front government had suffered a severe setback. Therefore all the powerful ministers evaded taking charge of the campaign. Even so, he directed the campaign single-handed. He secured for the SLFP a number of votes that the party had never before polled in that electorate. Thereby he displayed in ample measure his organizing ability and his popularity.
In 1977, Anura entered Parliament not through his parental political stronghold of Attanagalla or the Gampaha District, that he was used to, but through the Nuwara Eeliya-Maskeliya electorate which has a majority of plantation labour votes. He could spare only six days to campaign in this electorate. During the rest of the campaign period he had to go round the country campaigning for the party. Against all expectations, he secured 49000 votes and was elected second MP, beating Thondaman to third place. His victory in a neck-to-neck contest with two formidable leaders of the time, Gamini Dissanayake and Thondaman, after only six days of campaigning, is a remarkable incident in the parliamentary election history of Sri Lanka. This victory of his was in a background where strong men of the party had fallen like giant trees being uprooted, the party base was being eroded and only eight party candidates had been able to enter Parliament. 
Anura Bandaranaike became the youngest Leader of the Opposition not only in Sri Lanka but in the entire Commonwealth of Nations. When the office of the Leader of the Opposition fell vacant in 1983, he was appointed to that post with the consent of everyone. Everyone accepts that leading a miniscule SLFP group of eight MPs, undaunted, against a formidable UNP government side of 148 MPs, he discharged his responsibilities at the highest level of performance. His performance in that office displaying the marks of a mature politician was an excellent model for present day leaders to emulate.
Anuras performance in that office displaying the marks of a mature politician was an excellent model for present day leaders to emulate.

He took the entire burden of the campaign in the 1988 Presidential election contested by Sirimavo Bandaranaike, in the midst of violence and LTTE terror threats. He addressed 115 campaign meetings throughout the island and gave leadership to the campaign amidst showers of bombs and bullets, If not for the violence and the bogus votes, that election would have been won by Sirimavo. Anura also led the 1989 general election campaign together with his mother. He was also able to raise the consciousness of the people through paada yaathraas and ratha yaathraas. Most leaders today do not remember the way people waited with lit hulu athus, to greet Anura coming in those paada yaathraasand ratha yaathraas.
It is with the unanimous agreement of all Members of Parliament that Anura Bandaranaike reached the highest office in Parliament, that of Speaker. He added lustre to that office.
He gave a historic ruling that the Legislature is supreme. The Coalition was born due to his enthusiasm and perseverance. If not for the birth of the coalition, an SLFP-led government would not have been born in 2004. There is no one today to write about Anura and to commemorate his memory. Those who climbed the steps of the political ladder with his help when he was among the living do not appear to be uttering a word about him today. Sri Lankan politics is immersed in ingratitude today, to such an extent. Our society feels the absence of distinguished politicians of the calibre of Anura Bandaranaike, today, more than ever.

SL beat Bangladesh by 6 wickets
	
Sri Lanka defeated Bangladesh by six wickets to go 1-0 up in the two-match T20 series. After opting to bat, the hosts rode on fifties from Soumya Sarkar and Mushfiqur Rahim to post 193/5. In reply, fiery knocks from Kusal Mendis, Dasun Shanaka and Thisara Perera helped Sri Lanka seal the deal with 20 balls remaining.
At the halfway stage, Bangladesh would have felt that they have found their mojo back, having lost the Test series. However, all the good work done by their batsmen was undone in a jiffy through blistering knocks of Kusal Mendis and Danushka Gunathilaka - a 53-run stand inside five overs of play.
Then Dasun Shanaka and Thisara Perera came to party with a 65-run stand off 30 balls to seal the chase, and take a 1-0 lead in the two-match series.The second and final T20 will be held in Sylhet on February 18.

SL family allowed to stay in NZ
	
A Sri Lankan family who won the support of the Queenstown community in their fight against deportation have been given a reprieve and they will be allowed to stay in New Zealand for another year, the New Zealand Herald reported today.
Clutha-Southland MP Hamish Walker has been supporting the family, Dinesha Amarasinghe, Sam Wijerathne and their three boys Senath, Subath and Binath.
He said the Immigration and Protection Tribunal (IPT) ruled they could stay in New Zealand for the next year on humanitarian grounds, while their residence application was assessed.
"I called Dinesha and Sam this morning  they were both very emotional and so was I. Dinesha and Sam have worked incredibly hard to support their children and give them a bright future in New Zealand and this is the outcome they deserve," Walker said.
The family have lived in New Zealand for eight years but faced deportation after Dinesha's application for a work visa renewal was declined due to health issues. Their residency application, submitted in 2013, is on hold.
More than 400 people in the Queenstown community marched in November to support the family.
"It was incredibly humbling to see the way people came together to show compassion and an outpouring of love for a family that they respect and we want as part of the Queenstown community,"
The Wijerathne family are respected members of the Queenstown community and an example of how migrant workers living, working, and contributing to our communities in positive ways are so valuable to New Zealand, and especially communities like Queenstown and Te Anau,"
"There was still a lot to do however. While today's result is absolutely fantastic, the solution is only temporary and the family still need to seek residency. We have won a battle, but not the war and I'll continue to support them through this process and keep the pressure on the Minister," Walker said.

The Death of English
	
A prominent film critic once said something to the effect that the worst directors tended to come from film schools, while the best directors tended to transcend the limits of academia that such schools imposed on them and their colleagues. While its difficult to ascertain whether this is definitive, or true also of various other fields and professions, I can vouch, from my personal experiences, for the opinion, held by many, that it is true of writers, especially of critics: the best among them start out on their own terms, the worst among them come as young idealists from our universities. By no means do I intend this to be definitive, because there are exceptions, infrequent though they are.
My friend Dhanuka Bandara, waxing eloquent on two collections of essays, on the arts and on politics, by the late Regi Siriwardena, told me that Regi was not a top-of-his-class university product, and that Regi did not obtain First or even Second Class Honours from University College, adding in his own inimitable way that this was true of pretty much every great prose stylist in this country. That critic I referred to before, Pauline Kael, was like that too: she dropped out of the University of California, Berkley in her last year, owing to financial constraints (she made it a point, a few decades on, to joke and quip that the years she spent at Berkley encouraged her to get rid of a prose style which was academic and full of what she called sap-head objectivity).
The point Im trying to drive at here is that qualifications alone have never been enough to validate an artist, be he a performer or a purveyor. I am not aware how true this is of Sinhala and Tamil artists and writers, but I am painfully aware of how true it is of English artists and writers, particularly the latter. What schools and universities bestow on their graduates, that is with respect to a language, is the grammar and the syntax of that language. Taking what is learnt, while unlearning the rigidity entailed in committing it to your memory, and in the process unleashing your creativity to do away with (what else) sap-head objectivity, is part of the fun, but very many critics, from then and even now, fail to make that leap. Last Tuesday I talked about the death of Sinhala, from a specific angle. That compels me to visit the death of English, from another specific angle: the drab lifelessness of our critics and stylists.
Qualifications alone have never been enough to validate an artist, be he a performer or a purveyor. I am not aware how true this is of Sinhala and Tamil artists and writers
Its easier to write about an art form than it is to be a performer of that art form, easier to write about plays and movies and books than to be a stage director, film-maker, or writer. But critics are needed, especially in as small and indefinable a country as Sri Lanka, because works of art by default require cohesive critics who can identify the worth of the artist and convey it to a lay readership. Helping others to see, or more to the point discern, is the critics primary function, and in a country like ours, where a rift exists between the vernacular and the non-vernacular, the absence of a critical fraternity that writers well in English does tend to worry. To be as simple as possible, how are we to get our art forms and artists to the world outside
Speaking for myself, I prefer writers and critics who use their intelligence and instincts and let their emotions flow. When critics are insultingly put down as impressionistic, when what they write is ignored on the basis that their writings are ridden with emotions and vignettes (personal impressions, never even once following the rigid rationalisations that have been taught at school and at university), a confusion is sustained: what should criticism be about Its certainly an art in itself (thats why we call it vicharana kalawa), and not a science, so to let go of those rigid rationalisations that mar good writing isnt an option, its a necessity. Critics need to live, they need to breathe, to be alert.
What separates the late and the lamented writers of the past  Siriwardena, Ajith Samaranayake, L. O. de Silva, Philip Cooray, Gamini Haththotuwegama  from the new writers we have today is that the former were able to fulfil the chief function of any critic worth his salt: discerning what is new and original in a work of art and helping audiences see it. My belief is that Ediriweera Sarachchandra and Lester James Peries would have been able to survive with their work without such writers, but the existence of these purveyors, in the popular press (the most democratic form of media we have), helped them, and us, understand the sensibilities they were evoking in the people and the culture. On the other hand, the tendency of the modern critic is to rationalise something, anything, with academic principles. Just take a gander at this review of K. S. Sivakumarans recently published compilation, On Films Seen:
David Bordwell suggests... there are four key components present in film reviews. These components consist of a condensed plot synopsis, background information, a set of abbreviated arguments about the film, and an evaluation. Generally speaking, when a reviewer is evaluating a film he/she tends to be assessing some, or all, of the following: the motivation for what happens in the film, the films entertainment value, the films social relevance and social value, and the films aesthetic value. If it were easy everyone would be a film critic. It is a great job, most of the time. Unless of course, you are watching a genuinely bad film, the sort that once caused a notable film critic to comment, That is 90 minutes of my life I can never get back.
Whenever I read a review that suspends and transcends disbelief, and in a bad way, I feel like that notable film critic: those minutes spent perusing and turning over the pages are minutes I can never get back. But really, must film criticism, the most alive of all modes of criticism, follow Bordwells key components this way There are reviews which dont reveal the plot, and reviews (probably the best of them) that elaborate on rather than abbreviate arguments. When you follow the same format, you are not unlike that high school student who, to win his teachers attention and (if hes in a co-ed class) his girlfriends attention, regularly polishes up his homework to stick to what that teacher prescribes as the only correct structure of an essay to his class. (Critics who strayed from this  Pauline Kael included  were often described as being frustrated and random, but I for one prefer such manifestations of frustration, however random they may be, to the boredom of those correct formats and components we are taught to accept at an early age.)
K.S. Sivakumaran has reviewed, his book tells us, 58 movies; the most charitable and positive thing I can say here about On Films Seen is the fact that it contains (rather terse) reviews of Sinhala films which have not been explored by any English critic (Madhu Samaya, Umayangana, Mandakini). They are less reviews, in fact, than capsule reviews, which isnt bad, though their lapses of judgment (especially those that involve puritanical overtures, like the following: Being a natural heterosexual person, my immediate reaction in viewing the retrospective of the British film-maker Derek Jarman was one of repugnance and repulsion) take away from his sincerity.
The reviews for Jehan Aloysiuss Rag: The Musical were ecstatic when it first came out years ago: according to one writer it provided a potent appeal against campus violence. (Because when you strip away all the hype and the hoopla [whatever that hype and hoopla is] Rag is a rare animal indeed: a musical with a social conscience  but then have there never been musicals staged before that had a social conscience, however facile) These were predictable in the praise (not to mention the hype and the hoopla!) they bestowed on the production; it was almost as though the musical had been turned into an ineffable experience that existed to be venerated. Common sense does prevail in such circumstances, though the one account of the play that I had been waiting for came after it was re-staged this year, and not from a newspaperman; instead it was an undergraduate who came up with it.
... the elitism of this play, especially in terms of its language politics, was deeply problematic. Sinhala was used in the play for two specific reasons. One was to imply a sense of roughness or vulgarity (the raggers resort to Sinhala, to which the students who resist the rag unanimously respond in English). The second, was for what could be called in Sinhala as gong athal  to resort to cheap humour that ridiculed a much less privileged popular/folk tradition of Sinhala theatre, as well as to poke fun at the aesthetic sensibilities and gender performativity of Sinhala-speaking classes.
It was the kind of elitism I encountered, though in a much less insidious form, in Dear Children Sincerely, last August. When critics are emboldened by the cosmetics of a production, or any work of art for that matter, they tend to miss out on the undercurrents, the subtleties and easy-to-ignore nuances, which breathe life into that production. When you cant explain those undercurrents, when whats on the surface is easier to project, the writer will resort to that surface; you cant blame him for that, because thats his training, and because Sri Lanka, being what it is, is too small for an individual voice to bring the curtain crashing down on the producers who (wrongly) believe that those superficial cosmetics are enough to validate and vindicate their work. That review above, which garnered outrage from many of the theatregoers at the Wendt, was rare, and beautifully so, but the likes of it continue to be limited to the thoughtful blogger, the ardent activist, the revolutionary student.
The role of the critic, Kael wrote in 1963, was to help people see what is in the work, what is in it that shouldnt be, what is not in it that should be. Opinions do differ and converge, which is why what I like about an objet dart may not be what you like, or what you notice. Given all this, then, our critics need to go back to school, though a different school, to unlearn what has been learnt, to shed away the rigidities that have been imbibed, and to start living.

UPFA Deputy Minister Nishantha Muthuhettigamage today said 15 UNP Parliamentarians had agreed to join them to form a UPFA Government.
Addressing a news briefing in Galle, he said the peoples mandate is with the Joint Opposition now.
The UPFA and JO working together is not a strange thing. We are the same team which stayed separated for two and a half years. Both sides have agreed to work together for another two and a half years without any privilege or deal. The UNP is incapable of establishing a government on its own, he said.
He said if the UPFA governed the country well, it could achieve a two thirds majority at the upcoming General Election.
If we contest the General Election separately, we wont get anything. Even former President Mahinda Rajapaksa told us to leave the UNP. We went nowhere after maintaining a government for two and a half years with the UNP. Therefore, we will form a UPFA government, he said.(Sumathipala Deeyagahage and D. G. Sugathapala)

VIASL Chairman Ranjan Peiris said the selling rate of a Japanese Yen was Rs.1.47.
Therefore, a vehicle worth Rs.5 million will be increased by Rs. 500,000. This will only affect future vehicle imports, he said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

This was an advertisement that appeared in a newspaper. Many would get excited after seeing this advertisement because there were many who had purchased this vehicle, but no one had the opportunity to use it. 
The above advertisement appeared in a newspaper on the February 12, 2017. There had been many callers who inquired about this vehicle. Rizvi Ahmed from Galle was one. The owner of the vehicle had been one Danuka. Ahmed had been told that Danuka was an architect. The original price of the vehicle had been Rs 3.5 million, but Ahmed was able to negotiate and bring the price down to Rs 3.3 million. Being convinced that a vehicle of this type and condition for the agreed price was really a bargain Ahmed arrived in Kadawatha the next day (February 12). Danuka too arrived by the said vehicle at the agreed place in Kadawatha with the documents of the vehicle. The vehicle was in mint condition with only the front tyres appearing to be slightly worn out. The seller agreed to provide Ahmed with two new tyres if he purchased the vehicle. So finally it was agreed to sell the vehicle for Rs 3,275,000.
Ahmed who was much excited decided to take the vehicle on the same day to make his family happy. He informed the seller that he had to withdraw money from a Bank in Gampaha. After dropping him at the Bank in Gampaha Danuka had told Ahmed to come with the money to the Gampaha Kachcheri where he had to meet the GA regarding some matter. When Ahmed arrived with the money Danuka was there at the Kachcheri premises seated in his vehicle. The deal was finalized inside the vehicle which was in the vehicle park of the Kachcheri. With the exchange of documents Danuka had handed over the vehicle and excused himself saying that he had an appointment with the GA and remained at this place. Ahmed drove off in the vehicle.
He found no tyres as informed near the office and the GA was not present in his office. Ahmed called Danuka, but there was no reply. When he returned to the vehicle park he had the biggest shock of his life!
After driving some distance Ahmed received a call from Danuka saying that he forgot to give him the two new tyres and for him to collect them from the GAs office. Ahmed greatly appreciating the kindness extended to him by Danuka and returned to GAs office. Parking the Vehicle at the vehicle park he hastened towards the GAs office. He found no tyres as informed near the office and the GA was not present in his office. Ahmed called Danuka, but there was no reply. When he returned to the vehicle park he had the biggest shock of his life! The vehicle he cherished was missing. The documents relating to the vehicle and some other documents had all been inside the vehicle. Ahmed was speechless and could not think of anything.
The original price of the vehicle had been Rs 3.5 million, but Ahmed was able to negotiate and bring the price down to Rs 3.3 million
	He made a thorough search in Gampaha assisted by one of his brothers for any clues about the vehicle
	While the days passed, Ahmed came to know of a school principal who had experienced a similar incident
	Hearing this episode related by the principal, Ahmed realized that he had been swindled by a mass-scale robber
He continued relating his story saying that as there was no alternative, but to lodge a complaint at the Gampaha Police Headquarters, which he did. He made a thorough search in Gampaha assisted by one of his brothers for any clues about the vehicle for several days. While the search went on for the missing vehicle there was no response when they phoned Danuka. 
While the days passed, Ahmed came to know of a school principal who had experienced a similar incident. On meeting him he had related his story to Ahmed. 
The principal had seen an advertisement in the newspaper and responded with a telephone call. The seller had identified himself as an Engineer. The principal had visited an area in Kaduwela to inspect the vehicle. He was satisfied with the condition. After making the payment and finalizing matters with regard to documentation the principal had started to drive the vehicle when he received a call from the seller who had said, there is a brand new set up I purchased for the vehicle. It is with a lecturer employed at the campus. On your way go and get it. I have already spoken to the lecturer and he will give it to you. The principal had driven the car towards the private university in Malabe and after parking the vehicle had gone to meet the lecturer. To his surprise he wasnt there and when he returned he found the newly bought vehicle missing. 
CCTV footage 
On examining the footage in the CCTV camera, fitted at the university, it showed the so called engineer, who sold the vehicle, opening the door of the car and driving away in it. 
Hearing this episode related by the principal, Ahmed realized that he had been swindled by a mass-scale robber. It was too late when he had realized what had happened by which time he had lodged complaints at various police stations all over the island. 
The thief behind all these robberies had been a suspect taken into custody on 29th November 2009 by the Western Province Intelligence Unit on charges of stealing a vehicle. After being taken into custody he had been detained at the Borella Police Prison Cell. He had escaped from this cell following a carefully executed plan. 
While detained at the Borella Police Prison Cell he had waited until the police officers had fallen asleep. Using the blade of a hacksaw, he had smuggled into the cell, with the help of a labourer at the police station, and had cut two iron rods of his cell daily. A mobile phone battery charger, he had stealthily smuggled into his cell, was assembled to short circuit when plugged into the mains. He had during the dead of the night one day plugged it to the mains. His action had plunged the entire police station into darkness. Using this opportunity, and the broken iron rods, he made his escape. The Police tried all methods to apprehend him, but failed. The suspect continued to be involved in various types of rackets. He was a mastermind behind faking documents for vehicles after stealing them and reselling them. After selling the vehicles he stole them again using a key which he had crafted. This way he resold vehicles to gullible buyers. He continued this racket and the police were unable to apprehend him. 
Ahmed did not give up easily. He continued his hunt for the man who had robbed him of Rs 3.3 million. He visited most of the places which were suspicious and whenever he read about someone being apprehended over the theft of vehicles he was there to see whether the arrested person was the one who defrauded him. His searches led him to a police unit in the Kalutara District . He related full details of his story to the OIC of the unit, who promised to keep Ahmed informed of similar events. Ahmed noted down the telephone number of the OIC. 
The principal had driven the car towards the private university in Malabe and after parking the vehicle had gone to meet the lecturer. He wasnt there and when he returned he found the newly bought vehicle missing
Habitually he scanned through advertisements appearing in the newspapers to locate any similar ads that could hoodwink buyers. On 30th April 2017, as luck would have it, he noticed a similar advertisement. The details in the advertisement had several similarities to the advertisement that had put him in trouble. The only thing new was that there was a different telephone number. He then requested a woman, a relative of his, to call the relevant telephone number. While the conversation was in progress he recognized this voice as that of the one who had robbed him. The woman had indicated to the seller that her husband had sent the money from abroad and she was in a hurry to buy the vehicle and fixed the following day (May 1) to complete the transaction. 
A dangerous person 
Ahmed accompanied by some friends, who were employed by the Navy and the woman, travelled by a van to Aluthgama. Fearing that the suspect might be in possession of weapons Ahmed attempted to brief the HQI of Gampaha Police about his intentions using his phone. He tried to contact the inspector at the HQ and after his attempts were futile he phoned the Kalutara OIC on the number he had obtained from the police officer. The Kalutara OIC cautioned Ahmed that the suspect is a dangerous person and he might be in possession of weapons. He had further said that he could get his money back and asked for Rs 300,000.
Ahmed had thought for a while as he had already spent more than Rs 200,000 searching for them. He had then told the police officer to arrest this suspect quickly as he might escape again. The OIC asked me to wait till he sent a team to accompany me before I went to meet him. Later four persons in civvies arrived at the site in a three wheeler. One agreed to travel in the same three wheeler while the other three agreed to travel in the van with me and the woman. A close friend of mine who was in the navy posed as a brother of the woman. They both pretended that they had come by bus and alighted at Aluthgama before going to meet the suspect. The suspect arrived in the same vehicle he had sold to Ahmed. The suspect got the woman and the Navy person to board his vehicle and drove towards the main road. Turning into a by-road he drove very fast.The three wheeler followed them without being noticed by them. One of my friends who accompanied us videoed the movement of these vehicles from a vantage point in the Aluthgama town. The vehicle driven by the suspect stopped near a Villa in Aluthgama.
On examining the footage in the CCTV camera, fitted at the university, it showed the so called engineer, who sold the vehicle, opening the door of the car and driving away in it
The police officers in civvies immediately sprang upon this suspect and arrested him. My friend had videoed all this. A police officer who noticed this grabbed his phone and erased the video footage. When asked why he did this the police replied that they (the police) were doing something illegal. The police said that they were trying to help us. The police said that they had wanted to check whether there were weapons inside the vehicle, but they found none. Then they went inside the villa to the room the suspect said he was staying at. I noticed the bag in which I carried the money to hand over to the suspect. There were about 3-4 lacks of rupees inside. The police took that money and then brought him to the Police unit in Kalutara, said Ahmed.
 Police raid Villa 
Ahmed continuing the story said, At the time he inserted this advertisement in the newspapers he had booked in at this villa, taking it on rent for four days. He had also hired a watcher. The owner of the villa is a local politico and on that day he had gone to attend the May Day rally. On his return when he had learned about this incident he had visited the Bentota Police and lodged a complaint. In his complaint he had stated: I am renting out my house and rooms and on 29th April someone identifying himself as Prabath wanted to lease out the entire house for three days. Visiting the place on 29th he paid an advance and returned on the 30th in a white van and paid the balance. Then I handed over the keys. When I was at the May Day rally, I received a call from a nearby restaurant saying that the gentleman who was occupying my house had been taken away after being handcuffed by the police for stealing a vehicle. I am lodging this complaint for my own safety. The Kalutara Police unit wasnt aware of this complaint. The police who were engaged in the act of looking for the suspect at the villa were videoed by another friend of Ahmed, unknown to the police.
The thief behind all these robberies had been a suspect taken into custody on 29th November 2009 by the Western Province Intelligence Unit on charges of stealing a vehicle
When the suspect was brought to the police unit he had accepted that he had taken Rs 3.3 million from Ahmed. The police had then told the suspect that if he returned the money to me they would charge him for a minor offense. The suspect had then said that the money was at his house and he would give it. However the police hesitated. The OIC had said, Going at this time is difficult. Well go in the morning. 
When Ahmed had called the OIC the next morning he had responded by saying that he had to attend to some other matter. He had then said that the suspects house is in Kottawa, Mattegoda and had requested Ahmed to come to Kottawa. He had arrived in Kottawa around 09.30 Am with another friend. The OIC had kept them waiting in Kottawa till 08.00 PM holding out various excuses. The OIC had then arrived with a police team accompanying the suspect. 
Police frustrate Ahmed 
The police came in the vehicle of the suspect and asked us to follow them.We did as we were told and when approaching Mattegoda Road the OIC told us to stop the vehicle. He then told us that the suspects wife and children were at home and if they saw a crowd they would get scared. He then asked me to drop my friend and come alone. I drew the van alone and followed the police vehicle. Suddenly the vehicle in which the police were travelling gained speed and turned into a by lane and vanished. I failed to spot them. When I took a call to the OICs telephone, he wanted me to come to Namal Uyana Housing Complex, saying that the suspect was misleading them and not showing the house. The police frustrated me and led me astray. 
On the following day the OIC said that they (The police) had visited the suspects house, but despite a search they did not find any money. The Police continued to dodge me even though I visited them daily. I visited the police unit on 05th May and the police introduced me to a woman who was there saying that she was the wife of the suspect. She told me that she would obtain the money from a brother in New Zealand and pay me. I continued visiting the police unit except on 11th and 12th of May as they were Wesak holidays. When I called the OIC on the 13th he said that the suspect had been remanded. When I inquired about my money he replied that as agreed by the suspects wife the money would be refunded.
A police officer who noticed this grabbed his phone and erased the video footage. When asked why he did this the police replied that they (the police) were doing something illegal. The police said that they were trying to help us 
That days newspaper carried a news item saying that the suspect had been taken into custody by the Kalutara Police Unit, in Panadura while trafficking in drugs. He did not have any drugs in his possession, but we were the people who handed him to the police. We visited the police unit again on 17th May, but the OIC wasnt present. Realizing our predicament in the face of police trying to evade us, we visited the Kalutara DIG G.K. Perera who handed over this matter to the ASP. The ASP wanted us to come and inform him if no action was taken. As advised we visited the OIC and found the ASP and the OIC talking with the woman who was introduced to me as the wife of the suspect. This woman refused to pay back the money. When I mentioned about the promise she made to pay me the money, the OIC and the woman remained silent. I informed the ASP that I do not have a receipt to prove that I gave the money to the suspect. The ASP told me that the suspects signature is available in the police records and for me to prepare a letter forging this signature. I point blank rejected this suggestion saying that I do not engage in this type of forgery. Ahmed lamented. 
By this time the tyres of the vehicle had been replaced and the DVD player was removed. Finally Ahmed lost the money and the vehicle. There was no alternative place left for him to plead for redress. He complained to the Police Head Quarters and to the Police Commission. He even complained to several politicos, yet Ahmed had not received any response. 
The above is the story of the sad plight of Ahmed. What this writer has penned as his story are only the essential parts of a discussion that lasted more than five hours. 
Fake entries 
Our investigations over the past four weeks reveal that it began with the Crime Unit demanding Rs 300,000. That is why the police deployed four officers to arrest the suspect in Aluthgama. The suspect was apprehended and handed over to the police by Ahmed and his group in Aluthgama area on 01st of May 2017 . The police made fake entries saying that the suspect was arrested while trafficking in drugs in Panadura. By surreptitiously hiding evidence he was remanded until May 12. The suspect had been kept under detention at the police station until this day.The police records state that the suspect was arrested on May 12 in Panadura. 
An investigation into the details of telephone conversations Ahmed had with the OIC of the Police unit, reveals that Ahmed had been in constant communication with the OIC, beginning from May. There are more than ten oral evidence and written ones to prove that the suspect was actually arrested in Aluthgama. The complaint lodged by the owner of the villa at the Bentota police on the day of the arrest of suspect is clear evidence of this arrest taking place in Aluthgama. These police officers may not be aware that video footage, which shows the police body searching the suspect at the Villa in Aluthgama, exists. Adding to this there is also evidence to prove that the said vehicle remained parked at the Panadura Police Station on May 1. 
These police officers may not be aware that video footage, which shows the police body searching the suspect at the Villa in Aluthgama, exists. Adding to this there is also evidence to prove that the said vehicle remained parked at the Panadura Police Station on May 1
After arresting the suspect the police had promised Ahmed that they would get back his money, but even after remanding the suspect and thereafter the police had been dodging Ahmed. A closer study of what the police said and how they behaved in dodging Ahmed points out to one thing; it is apparent that the Rs 3.3 million promised by the suspect to be returned to Ahmed at the outset had been taken by the police. At the time of the arrest the money that was in the bag and identified as belonging to Ahmed had also not been accounted for. The police are responsible as they are aware to whose pockets the money had gone. 
Ahmed did not lose his balance during this whole period. He had had a firm belief that he was fighting against all odds. He never gave up. 
There may be many others in society who would have endured this type of experiences. When officers who are entrusted with the duty of safeguarding the laws of the land violate and bend them with ulterior motives, what will be the recourse available for the ordinary people 
An investigation by the Police Special Investigation Unit has now commenced. Now it is time that the fraudster, the ASP and the police team, and all those who attempted in concealing this incident and fabricating evidence to be taken into custody. Failing which there will be more individuals like Ahmed falling prey to these robbers and keeping quiet.
