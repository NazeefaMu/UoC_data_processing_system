A vital way to restore stability among the people
	
In developing countries especially most social and political scientists believe that major structural changes are required in vital areas to bring about stability and security. One of these key areas is poverty alleviation as we highlighted in our editorial on Wednesday. In Sri Lanka, structural changes are needed even in the government -- meaning the Executive and the Legislature where instability has increased specially after the unexpected results at the February 10 local council elections. But even if some measure of political stability is achieved from next month when Parliament resumes sittings after the prorogation, stability and security among the people will be achieved only when practical steps are taken to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor -- a gap reaching its peak in Sri Lanka and all over the world.
Some major United Nations organisations in a report on the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2017 have given a grim warning. They say that the greater number of conflicts, whose impacts are often exacerbated by climate-related shocks, is one of the main drivers behind the fact that after steadily declining for more than a decade, global hunger appears to be on the rise once more. This is threatening to derail the international commitment to end hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030.
The report was issued by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO). The report examines the ways in which food insecurity can trigger conflicts and provides valuable insights into how food security can help prevent the outbreak of unrest and violence.
In 2016 the number of chronically undernourished people in the world is estimated to have increased to 815 million, up from 777 million in 2015 though still down from about 900 million in 2000. After a prolonged decline, this recent increase could signal a reversal of trends. The food security situation has worsened in particular in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, South-Eastern Asia and Western Asia and deterioration has been observed most notably in situations of conflict and conflicts combined with droughts or floods. 
The apparent halt to declining hunger numbers is not yet reflected in the prevalence of child stunting, which continues to fall, though the pace of improvement is slower in some regions. Globally, the prevalence of stunting fell from 29.5 per cent to 22.9 per cent between 2005 and 2016, though across the world some 155 million children under five years of age still suffer from stunted growth.
The joint UN report says wasting affected one in twelve, about 52 million of all children under five years of age in 2016, more than half of whom or 27.6 million live in Southern Asia. Multiple forms of malnutrition coexist, with countries experiencing simultaneously high rates of child under-nutrition, anaemia among women and adult obesity. Rising rates of overweight and obesity add to these concerns.
According to the report, childhood overweight and obesity are increasing in most regions, and in all regions for adults. In 2016, about 41 million children under five years of age were overweight. The number of conflicts is also on the rise. Exacerbated by climate-related shocks, conflicts seriously affect food security and are a cause of much of the recent increase in food insecurity. Conflict is a key driver of situations of severe food crisis and recently re-emerged famines, while hunger and under-nutrition are significantly worse where conflicts are prolonged and institutional capacities weak. 
According to the report, addressing food insecurity and malnutrition in conflict-affected situations cannot be business as usual. It requires a conflict-sensitive approach that aligns actions for immediate humanitarian assistance, long-term development and sustaining peace. This report sends a clear warning signal that the ambition of a world without hunger and malnutrition by 2030 will be challenging  achieving it will require renewed efforts through new ways of working.
The report names Sri Lanka as one of the worst affected in South Asia and the government needs to act fast in taking steps to bridge the gap between the rich and the poor.

An Elephantine Oil Anointing Tale at the village temple
	
The Sinhala Hindu New Year is in all probability the only main traditional festival that is commonly observed by the Sinhalese and Tamils, and celebrated by Buddhists and Hindus in the country. Traditional astrologers believe that the sun completes a circle across the twelve subdivisions of the zodiac in the course of one year, taking one month to go across each group called a constellation. It is significant for Buddhists and Hindus who commemorate the commencement of the solar new-yearto observe theage-old rituals thatends with the oil anointing ceremony. 
Oil Anointing and Pachyderms
I was confused after seeing an elephant receiving a lot of attention at a temple, visiting my cousins in the village a couple of decades ago. What is the rationale behind the temple authorities ordering a pachyderm for the annual ritual during the festive season, I inquired. Yes, he said, May be an unusual experience, but it is customary for the she elephant owned by a well-connected businessman from the area to be anointed with oil. My cousin replied. 
The much publicized ceremony got underway at the temple the priest on this occasion playing an insignificant role, leaving it to the Prabhu clan [elite] and a few prominent elements who dominates the Dhayaka sabhawa. The gaily decorated entrance with traditional gokkola and punkalas added extra glamour. The arrangements were colourful and impressive.
The traditional oil lamp was receiving its floral arrangements with jasmine flowers by a few jacket and cloth clad charming damselsfrom the area
This giant platform I asked him pointing to the specially built stage and a ramp. That is to match the height of the ten footer tusker Hasthi-Rajaya, doesnt she look majestic, and its presence enhances the standing and value of the ceremony.

Can we get your Tommya anointed as well I proposed.
Dont create a scene here, this is a village he warned me.
The Sinhala/Hindu Avurudu festival reach a climax with an anointing ceremony followed by the first bath for the New Year. Oil is mixed with herbal paste for the family elder to rub on the heads of other members while reciting the famous verse, a pali/Sinhala rhyme. People sit with a white cloth under their feet. While some go to the nearest temple in the village seeking the blessings of the Loku Hamuduruwo others visit the elderly indigenous physician, or the vedamahattaya who attends on every villager who walks in to his chamber.
Anointing oil and Nanu (Herbal mixture) is performed just before taking the ceremonial bath. The observance has its roots in Kandyan era, where it was performed as a religious ritual by the Royal Nekath Mohottala, who would directly supervise it, while the royal physician prepares the oil as well as Nanu. The oil is made out of herbs such as, Sevendara, Gorochana, beli-mal, kalanduru-ala, kohomba-kola, sandalwood, iriveriya, kumkumappu, and sathsanda. The Nanu is a concoction made using ingredients agreed by astrologers and differ each year; usually, leaves from Bo, Nuga, Divul, Kohomba, Karadana, or Kumbuk are used, but according to the Almanac of the year. It is the same therapeutic leaves as prescribed that is held over the head and laid on the ground for the feet, duringthe ceremony.
The traditional oil lamp was receiving its floral arrangements with jasmine flowers by a few jacket and cloth clad charming damsels from the area. Prabhu dayakes would light it; that included the local government member, the businessmen and the Bhandagarika, [treasurer ] of the Dhayake sabha. I noticed one mischievous young man attempting to decorate the hair-do of a pretty girl with a bunch of jasmines.
He cannot do that My cousin objected. Let them have a little fun, dont be jealous. 
Kiribath, and many a varieties of oil cakes and plantains were arranged on the white cloth-covered the table in the dana salawa. Inquired by my cousin, the Abiththaya [acolite] said, Dhanapala Mudalali, the businessmen spent a lot on the function, while ladies from Kulangana Samitiya collected the balance by visitingevery house.
That is how it happens, a precedence had been created; on the orders of Bandagarika, the abittiya make a special one to give priority for the elite, friends of Businessmen and the Prabhu clan
With few more minutes to go for the much awaited nekatha, special guests arrived with family kith and kin at the scene. The organisers garlanded and ushered them to the inner chamber, where the oil lamp was to be lighted. While hundreds of people; young mothers carrying their new-born babies; elderly and the sick standing in hot sun for their turn, the treasurer signaled to the mahout to get the animal near the ramp to have its head auspiciously anointed on priority. As the time approached the CD played Karaneeya metta sutta. The queue was getting longer as people started walking in numbers. I observed with astonishment a second queue being hurriedly arranged by the abittaya.
That is how it happens, a precedence had been created; on the orders of Bandagarika, the abittiya make a special one to give priority for the elite, friends of Businessmen and the Prabhu clan. 
He cannot do that I objected. Let them have a little fun, dontbe so discourteous.
The matter was getting unusually delayed, its well past the nekathabeing worried over the delay we walked up to the central area through curiosity; and soon realized the folly; the organisers were in a quandary; they were arguing which direction to face; almanac says South, but the ramp has been constructed facing the opposite direction. The elephants head cannot be reached and the next nearest spot accessible was the tail, the Nayaka priest obviously was not happy, he vehemently opposed.
No way, I will apply oil only on the head of the tusker, like in previous occasions, he was adamant. However the businessman, the owner of the proboscidean reluctantly agreed, no options but the never-say-die Bandagarika would attend to the task.

Kalu kaputa sudu venaturuMolgahe dalu enaturu, Hal essa pela venaturuEkasiya vissata desiya vissak ayu bo weva (Until the black crow turns white--until the rice pounder sprouts buds-- until the rice seeds germinates-may your life be as long as two hundred and twenty, instead of the hundred and twenty)
He recited the verse reading a note prepared by a student and applied Nanu just above the giants tailabittaya inviting the devotees for cries of Sadhu..Sadhu. In fact some very old ladies were seen worshipping the tusker who carries the relics casket during annual perahera of the temple.
A village octogenarian said, in the good old days the Nanu was prepared in the temple ten days prior to the Avurudu while the monks recited Pirith throughout the long process. Are they following these traditions now Do they use the correct ingredients tosay the least 
Oil Anointing is an age-old avurudu ritual, the last, and an integral part of the Sinhala and Hindu New Year, which is gradually diminishing in value, hijacked by temple politics
However, I was relieved, on our return to see Tomiya relaxing at home.

Assault on Dutch tourists Violent ' Beach ' Culture chokes tourism in Mirissa
	
The night began with fun until more local guys began to inappropriately touch the girls in the group
Onlyaround 5% of establishments in the area possess licenses
Six suspects were taken into custody

Mirissa has always been a destination frequented by both locals and tourists for its pristine beaches and other tourist attractions. Over the years, various other towns along the Southern coastal belt have emerged as tourist hotspots giving rise to a unique culture. While the tourism industry is reaching its peak, various opportunities are being presented to tourists as means of placing Sri Lanka on the world map. Amid such a pleasant landscape, there are certain incidents which would reflect negatively on the country. One such incident occurred two weeks ago in Mirissa. When news of locals assaulting a group of tourists at Water Creatures Beach Guest Restaurant and Surf Bar in Mirissa made its rounds it was considered as another minor incident initially. But with various accusations against the workers at this particular restaurant the matter seems to have gotten out of hand.
In an attempt to shed light on the recentturn of events theDailymirror visited thisparticular restaurant in Mirissa.

Media attention

As reported by Dutch tourist a Raffie Van Maren, some locals had started to dance around a group of females despite members of this group refusing the company of these locals. The night began with fun until more local guys began to inappropriately touch the girls in our group and also other tourist girls at the bar. We complained about this to the guys working at the bar, but they laughed at us and continued to laugh every time a local guy harassed a girl. After a while, we decided to leave until things escalated between local guys and a group of tourists. The matter escalated when one of the guys started rubbing his penis on a females shoulder whilst they were seated. When I saw this I told the guy that this was unacceptable, and the girl, in shock, stood up and got really angry with him. Things started to escalate and while this continued, we decided to leave as soon as possible. When we were walking towards the exit of the beach, we saw local guys running towards us. One guy, we were with, fell to the ground after being punched and was repeatedly kicked at and punched on by five or six guys at the same time. All these guys had been at the Surf Bar and Restaurant before. One local started running towards me, but before I knew I was on the ground getting punched and kicked at by eight guys at the same time. I was screaming and shouting, but they did not care and kept attacking me for at least ten minutes. My forehead was busted open and I had similar wounds to my right ear and right arm, said Van Maren.

Business affected by false media report 
The Daily Mirror visited this restaurant / surf bar which is tucked in a corner along the beach stretch in Mirissa. Its owner Harsha Prasanna has been in the tourism industry for 17 years and claims that his workers have been accused for the first time. It was April 7 and we had one of our parties here where both locals and tourists enjoyed their stay. Usually there are DJ parties on different days and on Saturday it was our own house party. By about 3.00am people started walking out and we decided to call it a day. The tourists who claim that this incident took place were seated near the shore. A few blocks away theres another bar and a few stewards working there were also at the party. During parties we dont go to check whos talking with whom because its not our business and we respect everybodys privacy. After the party concluded all guests walked out and I didnt bother about what happened elsewhere. 
But next morning I got news that some tourists were assaulted by those working at Sunshine Beach Restaurant, which is a few blocks away from this restaurant, and I still didnt take much notice because it didnt happen in my restaurant. But on Monday or Tuesday morning I saw a news report in the Daily Mirror which said that this incident had taken place at my restaurant and the stewards working at my restaurant had assaulted them. My friends in Colombo and overseas sent me messages and I was shocked, said Prasanna. 
He further assured that such an incident never took place within the boundaries of his restaurant. I can show all CCTV footage and no such incident took place here. I then lodged a complaint with the Police stating that its defamatory and requested them to conduct an investigation and get hold of the perpetrators. I was severely thrashed on social media and as a result of this false media report people are reluctant to visit my restaurant. Earlier people used to recommend us to others and we had good reviews on our social media pages. My stewards are very friendly with guests and so far we havent encountered violent situations. Six suspects were taken into custody and people can now find out whether they work for me or elsewhere. The tourists have had no idea where the locals worked at. Since they were at the party in my restaurant they must have thought that the locals were those working at my restaurant as well,  he continued. 
While agreeing to the fact that his restaurant doesnt have a license to carry out a tourism-related business Prasanna also claims that only around 5% of establishments in the area possess licenses. There are several hotels and restaurants along this beach stretch which dont have licenses. This is the same throughout Mirissa, he added.

Sunshine Beach Restaurant closes its business 
The Daily Mirror also contacted Sunshine Beach Restaurant and the management said that one person working at the restaurant was involved in the incident. The rest of them were outsiders including a three-wheel driver and some boys from the area. But I closed our restaurant early for the day on the day of the incident. We usually dont go towards Surf Bar although it is a few blocks away. We didnt see CCTV footage to identify the people. After the incident are closed down our restaurant as well and it is a huge blow to our business, a spokesperson for Sunshine Beach Restaurant said. 
Restaurant operated without a license

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) Chairman Kavan Ratnayake said that the initial inquiry conducted by the SLTDA into the incident has revealed that the restaurant had not obtained a license from the SLTDA.
According to the Tourism Act it is mandatory for all tourism related service providers in Sri Lanka to obtain license from the SLTDA. Therefore, this restaurant cannot be considered as an authorized tourism-related business establishment. The SLTDA will pursue stern action against the operators of the restaurant through its Enforcement Unit. At the same time, the Excise Department should seriously consider the cancellation of the restaurants liquor license as it is not an authorized tourism related service provider. The Tourist Police Division and the local Police authorities are conducting separate investigations into the criminal aspect of the incident. We, as the state tourism authority, will fully support and facilitate the Police investigation by providing air tickets and accommodation for the Dutch tourists to visit Sri Lanka for the Police inquiry and other proceedings, said Ratnayake. 

Exchange of money creating tension 
Sharing his views on a recent holiday experience in the South, Quirien Van Dongen of Netherlands opined that poverty is an issue and added that the exchange of money creates tensions between locals and tourists. As long as there is no commercial relationship, things will go smoothly. But if money is involved the situation changes. In the case of beach boys I found that its a whole different world in the South/ West compared to the main land. They spoiled my holiday experience to an extent, but this is the case in every country where there is a beach life and Sri Lanka is not alone in this, said Van Dongen.
I can show all CCTV footage and no such incident took place here. I then lodged a complaint with the Police stating that its defamatory and requested them to conduct an investigation-Prasanna

Stewards in Mirissa 
The term beach boy used to address youth working in the beach has a derogatory effect. A beach boy is defined as someone who operates as a lifeguard or other worker at the beach. With the tourism industry flourishing in the South, there are many of them in abundance along the Galle-Hikkaduwa coastal belt. When inquired, the Daily Mirror learned that there are no beach boys or guides in Mirissa, but there are stewards who work at restaurants and help out tourists when in need. Speaking to us, two of them shared their experiences. 
The incident affectsall of us- Isuru 
G.H Isuru has worked as a steward for close to two years. We associate with tourists who come from developed countries such as Europe, America etc. They are more humane than most locals and therefore it is quite easy for us to work with them. I serve food and drinks to our guests and ensure that they have a pleasant experience. I make a living from the dollar or euro they give me. We work in a cycle.
There are restaurants open for breakfast, lunch and dinner and then there are parties and we work throughout the day. Some guests are a trouble once they are drunk, but we make sure that we keep our cool. All boys working at these establishments are also from this area.
We never argue with guests. People will say various things about our professions, but they can only do that. If they experience what we endure, they would never say such things.
It is our own people who pull us down, but our guests have always shown us respect. Foreign guests prefer Mirissa because its peaceful, but this is not the same in Unawatuna or elsewhere because those areas are populated by these beach boys.
The incident that took place affects everybody. Its during these six months that we earn and we have to live on what we earn for the next six months, said Isuru. 

Negative aspect of bad reviews-Udayashan
M. G. Udayashan is another steward working at Surf Bar and has been in the industry for a while. These incidents shouldnt take place because once a restaurant starts getting bad reviews guests dont go there anymore. The particular news report addressed certain people as beach boys but there arent any in Mirissa. Im content with the work I do. Its about giving some food for the guests and maintaining a good relationship with them. Compared to local guests foreign guests are friendlier and they speak pleasantly, said Rasika.

Well continue with interrogations
- Weligama Police HQI 
Weligama Police Headquarter Inspector Lasantha Buddhika when contacted said that six suspects had been taken into custody and would be in remand till April 19. We couldnt find any CCTV footage leading to the incident and as mentioned by its owner the incident hadnt taken place at his restaurant. The Dutch tourist who is making this claim too is not in the country.
They say they were assaulted, but we need a medical report to prove it. Most incidents around Mirissa involve guests leaving without paying money. They say that their jewellery was stolen or give some excuse and leave, so that they dont have to pay money for their stay. This is quite common. With regard to this particular incident we will continue with interrogations because the owner has also claimed that there was a false media report and that his reputation was tarnished, said Inspector Buddhika. 

Tourist Police should be decentralized to touristy areas in future- Minister 
Speaking at a press conference Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga said that it is the responsibility of the Government to ensure the safety of tourists who visit Sri Lanka. It is the primary objective of the Government and it has dedicated that duty to the Ministry of Tourism to ensure that all tourists who come to Sri Lanka are safe.
We have to depend mainly on the tourist department when theres an incident of this nature in order to take prompt action and take those people into custody, produce them in courts and have them remanded.
If the Police are seen in Mirissa and other problematic areas then people would not attempt to engage in such notorious acts. There must be adequate personnel who could be deployed from Police stations to ensure that tourists are safe. The Tourist Police should be decentralized to those touristy areas to control these incidents. Im grateful to the Police since they have arrested six suspects and now they have to be identified.
The Government of Sri Lanka is very much dependent on the tourist industry, so I kindly request the SLTDA to make a prolonged recommendation of how we should minimize such incidents from reoccurring. 

If the Police are seen in Mirissa and other problematic areas then people would not attempt to engage in such notorious acts

The Police department should also take appropriate action against those culprits, the minister said.

Baggage delay: Kuwaiti airline told to pay Rs.2 mn as compensation
	
Colombo Commercial High Court Judge Mahinda Samayawardana yesterday ordered Kuwaiti Airways to pay Rs.2 million as compensation to two lawyers Mr. and Mrs. Mahinda Jayawardana for the immense hardship they suffered during their trip to Egypt in 2010 because of the baggage delay caused by the negligence on the part of Kuwait Airways.
The plaintiffs, a husband and wife, who are also attorneys cited the World Travel Center Colombo (Pvt) Ltd., South Asian Travels Ltd and Kuwaiti Airways Corporation as defendants.
They instituted this action demanding Rs.10 million as damages for the suffering they underwent during their travel on a holiday package.
The case against the 1st and 2nd defendants was taken up ex parte and inter partes in connection with the 3rd defendant.
The 3rd defendant admitted to the flight delay and the baggage delay and said all measures were taken to mitigate the inconveniences and damage caused to the plaintiffs.
It also made efforts to exonerate itself from any liability based on the IATA General Conditions of Carriage (Passenger and Baggage) and Kuwait Airways General Conditions.
The Court held that these are inapplicable to what was immediately relevant because they were obviously not part of the contract because of the fact that the attention of the plaintiffs had not been drawn to these terms and conditions when the contract was handed over.
The Court held that though the delay might have occurred at the hands of Egypt Air, the 3rd Defendant Kuwait Airways is jointly liable as Article 30(3) of the Schedule to the said Act.
Court also held that the plaintiffs had succeed in tort for breach of duty of care especially in relation to handling baggage and resulting in grave inconveniences caused to the plaintiffs and justice will be met by awarding a sum of Rs.2,000,000 to both plaintiffs as damages along with taxed cost of the action.
Chandaka Jayasundere PC instructed by G.G.Arulpragasam appeared for the plaintiffs. Avinda Rodrigo instructed by M/S F.J & G De Saram appeared for the 3rd defendant. (S.S.Selvanayagam)

Car wheels in sync with Wheel of Fortune
	
When he was at the dizzy height of power a certain leading politico had an expensive car worth over Rs.60 million imported for his playboy son, breaking all rules in the book.
The expensive car, a type that only the richest celebs in the world would use, was in fact, more-or-less a plaything gifted by a doting father to his son.
With the salad days coming to an end following the unexpected reversal of fortune for the father, the son not only had to cease using the car, but also had to keep it out of the public eye.
Thus, fallen into long disuse, the car is said to be decaying and the wheels now dysfunctional.

Dont care about inconveniencing public
	
Interviews were held about two years ago to select qualified pharmacists to fill over 80 vacancies existing in 25 pharmacies in a city which is a haunt of many leading politicos, but the appointment letters to the selectees are yet to be issued, they say.
Pressures being brought on the authorities by some politicos to give appointments to their favorites who have failed to meet the stipulated qualifications is said to be the reason for the inordinate delay in filling the vacancies. People calling at the pharmacies in this city with doctors prescriptions are compelled to cool their heels in long queues due to the unavailability of a sufficient number of pharmacists to serve them, they say.

Glossing over Orthopaedic Anomalies
	
medical malady
An active lifestyle is part and parcel of healthy living. There is a certain group of diseases that affect the skeletal and muscular systems. These diseases negatively affect a persons active lifestyle. From the most common condition of arthritis to the very rare aseptic osteonecrosis, these orthopaedic conditions greatly affect a persons health and lifestyle. This weeks edition of Health Capsule features Dr. Mohammad Mashfiqul Arafin Siddiqui, Orthopaedic Surgeon, Mount Elizabeth Hospital, Singapore, who answered various questions that gloss over orthopaedic conditionsin general. 
Orthopaedic diseases are very common among the ageing population. Complaints of muscle and joint aches that are more often heard indicate the increase in the incidents of orthopaedic cases. In addition, people are becoming increasingly aware of sports which especially contribute to orthopaedic injuries such as torn anterior cruciate ligaments (ACLs) in the knee joint, Dr. Siddiqui stated. Considering Sri Lankas high interest in sports (especially in cricket and rugby), orthopaedic complications are definite threats. The more sports a person engages in, makes the individual more likely to be left without a guard against such health issues. In general, orthopaedic problems are quite common and according to the orthopaedic surgeon, it is very likely that its frequency would ascend further in future. 
Not related to age
According to Dr. Siddiqui, back pains and knee pain spearhead as the most often contracted orthopaedic conditions. Knee pain is not just limited to the elderly. Surprisingly even young knees are susceptible to suffering from pain. Osteoarthritis is the most common causative factor that leads to knee pain in adults. This is due to the wearing out and degeneration of cartilage in the knee joints. Mechanical pain on movement is often experienced. In young patients, the cause of knee pain varies from individual to individual depending on the activities they engage in. Sports injuries are most often the root cause for knee pain in the younger generation, he explicated.

The conditions of knee pain can be branched out as primary and secondary, where there is no particular cause for knee pain in the primary condition. Secondary complications could occur as the after effects of previous knee injuries and fractures, ACL injuries and previous surgeries for meniscectomy (surgical removal of the meniscus cartilage of the knee), he continued, adding that inflammatory arthritis, gout and rheumatoid arthritis may also result in knee pains. 
Signs and symptoms
Conditions like osteoarthritis are not very surprising in senior citizens, but is it possible to develop arthritis at a young age The answer to that question is yes. Dr. Siddiqui mentioned that just like knee pain, the younger generation is under threat of other orthopaedic maladies. So although it is less common, a young person can develop osteoarthritis. Total meniscectomy of the meniscus cartilage in young patients create circumstances where the patient is prone to falling victim to arthritis at a much younger age than the general population, he informed. Previous sports injuries are to blame as well. X-rays are as good a method as any other to diagnose orthopaedic conditions like arthritis. When the elderly complain of the common orthopaedic symptoms such as joint aches, it is natural to suspect arthritis. Since arthritis and similar conditions are least likely suspected in children and teens, how are these anomalies detected in them  When they complain of mechanical knee pain it is important to pay attention to the following symptoms. Patients tend to feel pain in the front of the knee during movements; especially when going up or down the stairs. The range of knee movement would also be limited, explainedDr. Siddiqui. 
Variety in treatment

Obtaining treatment on time is important. Otherwise arthritis can lead to other conditions. Valgus deformities can result from arthritis causing abnormalities such as malalignment of the knees, he informed. 

There are two methods of orthopaedic treatment. The non-operative and the operative method. Non- operative treatment methods include activity modifications. For example, if a patient has to deal with a flight of stairs regularly, this activity would simply be changed to the use of an elevator. Activity modifications deal with similar scenarios. Physiotherapy helps strengthen different muscles in the legs. Medication as well as injections for early arthritis aids in treatment (injections are only temporary treatments). Weight loss is an important factor to consider, he stated. The surgeon further accentuated that the body weight has a bearing on the knees. When a person performs an activity like running, jogging or even walking, this adds to the work load on the knees, increasing the pressure applied upon them. Weight loss helps minimize the pressure on the knees. Use of walking aids assist in reducing the force placed on the knees. 
Operative treatments depend on the patients condition. Pure arthritis in a young patient calls for realignment or replacement of the knee compartment. Sometimes just part of the knee is replaced whereas with more severe cases complete knee replacement is required. Sometimes a scope is performed where a camera is used as an aid to detect the defect. Sometimes meniscus tears could be the reason for the pain that is caused in the knee, but the condition could be misinterpreted as a different condition, mentioned Dr. Siddiqui. He stressed that proper clinical diagnosis is vital. Therefore imaging is very important to confirm the condition properly. The cause of knee pains could be due to other reasons such as cancers and tumours. 
Surgical risks and complications
There are bilateral cases that call for replacement of both knees in a patient. However not all patients are able to undergo such surgeries. Patients have to be carefully selected for such treatments based on whether they are able to tolerate certain conditions. The doctor warned that there are risks and complications that entail such surgeries. Many orthopaedic procedures deal with implants. Therefore infection is a common risk as a foreign body is inserted through the implant. Limb surgeries may lead to deep vein thrombosis or DVT which is the formation of a blood clot in a particular vein which may cause immobilization of the limbs. Fractures as well as injury to nearby structures like nerves and blood vessels can occur during surgery. Paralysis is another risk feared by patients in relation to spinal surgeries, he added. Long term planning is essential before surgical procedures are considered. According to the surgeon, the lifespan of a knee replacement lasts for around 15-20 years before a replacement is required again. Therefore a long term plan should be formulated with regard to the patients health before surgery is performed. However today orthopaedic surgeries are quite safe with maximum recovery and the risks that entail are very low, Dr. Siddiqui assured.

Government simmering in its own soup
	
The crisis of the present Government is nothing but one of its own making
The two incidents have thrown the country into utter confusion
The SLFP led by President Sirisena is in disarray divided over Unity Government
The UNP has temporarily suppressed a rebellion against it with a promise to reorganise the party

The retreat by the politicians into their family life during the Sinhala and Hindu New Year and President Maithripala Sirisenas absence from the country to attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in London, had obscured the political mess prevailing in the country.
The February 10 Local Government Elections and the No-Confidence Motion (NCM) presented by the Joint Opposition against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe were the immediate causes that transformed an already simmering conflict in the Government into chaos.
The two incidents have thrown, the country in general and the ruling coalition in particular, intoutter confusion.
The two main parties in the ruling coalition, the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) have been bewildered as to whether and how they should continue with their coalition.
The SLFP led by President Maithripala Sirisena is in disarray and divided over the continuation of the so-called National Unity Government with the UNP and a split seems tobe imminent.
On the other hand, the UNP leadership has temporarily suppressed a rebellion against it with a promise to reorganise the party.
The President is increasingly being isolated by his coalition partner as well as the members of his own party.
It was against this backdrop that he prorogued the Parliament on April 12, on the eve of the New Year holidays.
The statement by Minister Lakshman Kiriella this week that there was no specific reason for the prorogation of Parliament and it was only a tradition was an insult to the peoples intellect.
Had it been done according to tradition it wouldnt have been a surprise move. Here, even the top leaders of the two main parties in the ruling coalition were caught off-guard by thePresidents move.
There is no doubt that the President prorogued Parliament in order to buy time to decide and prepare for his next move in his desperate attempt to bolster his sagging grip over his party as well as the Government.
This reminds us of two similar incidents where a Prime Minister and a President had prorogued Parliament to save them from an apparent threat of ouster.
It would have been embarrassing for the UNP as the ministries that had been tasked to take action against corruption were held by UNP Ministers
In February 1977 Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, threatened by a No-Confidence Motion by her one-time coalition partner Lanka Sama Samaja Party with the assistance of the main Opposition UNP, prorogued the National State Assembly (NSA), the then Parliament.
And she dissolved the Assembly on May 18 the same year without reconvening it. President Ranasinghe Premadasa, who had been threatened with an impeachment motion by the dissidents of his party, the former ministers Lalith Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayake in 1991 also prorogued the Parliament in order to buy time to decide on his next move to scuttle the motion. However, the motion was dismissed by Speaker M.H. Mohamed on the grounds of insufficient signatures in it, when the Housewas reconvened.
Despite the Local Government Elections in February and the No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister being seen as the immediate cause for the present crisis in the government and in its two main parties, the conflicts within the Government has been festeringsince 2016.
And interestingly the large-scale corruption allegedly committed by the leaders of the former as well as the present administrations seems to be the chief contributing factor for the conflicts within the Government as well as for the present political crisis in the country.
It must be recalled that President Sirisena in an unexpected turn of events in October 2016 launched a scathing attack on the Bribery Commission, Criminal Investigation De
partment (CID) and the Financial Crimes Investigating Division (FCID) of the Police claiming that the three institutions had been politicized.
Later he and Minister Rajitha Senaratne justified his controversial statement by saying that the three institutions were very slow in looking into the high-profile acts of corruption committed by the leaders of theformer regime.
However, it would have been an embarrassing situation for the UNP as the ministries that had been tasked to take action against corruption were held by UNP Ministers.
The President again in July last year accused the UNP, this time directly, for delaying and even stalling investigations against the leaders of the previous Government. During a Cabinet meeting, he had reportedly challenged to catch the thieves within three months if the Police and the Attorney Generals Department were brought under him.
Then he was critical of the UNPs apparent connivance in the Central Bank bond scam and appointed a Presidential Commission of inquiry to probe the highly controversial transaction.
The local council elections became a turning point in the relationship between the SLFP and the UNP and it has apparently marked the beginning of the downfall of the yahapalanaya government
The proceedings of the commission led to the resignation of UNP Assistant Leader Ravi Karunanayake from his ministerial portfolio on August 10, last year which in turn led to Justice and Buddha Sasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe stepping down from his post 13 days later.
The President, who went public with allegations of corruption against the UNP during the recent local elections, called for the resignation of the Prime Minister after the humiliating defeat of the election. In fact the local council election defeat of the UNP can be attributed to the bond scam, among others, as 1.5 million out of 5 million voters who voted for the UNP in August 2015 had rejected the party this time while the SLFP and the UPFA had received the same number of votes (1.5 million).
The local council elections became a turning point in the relationship between the SLFP and the UNP and have apparently marked the beginning of the downfall of theYahapalanaya Government.
While heightening the strife between the two parties in the Government it also gave a huge morale boost to the Mahinda Rajapaksa camp which instilled fear in the minds of many members of SLFP on their survival.
Despite the defeat of the NCM against the Prime Minister on April 4 being a temporary setback for the former President and his loyalists, it has yielded to them by way of dividing the SLFP and further antagonizing the two ruling parties.
A shortsighted UNP demanded the resignation of the SLFP members who voted in favour of the NCM from their posts.
Rajapaksa promptly responded by an open invitation for them to join his camp.
In the face of the political trend created by the local elections in the country, the 16 MPs would happily accept the invitation. Former Minister S.B. Dissanayake, a well-known turncoat had already stated that those who voted for the NCM would form an alliance with theJoint Opposition.
The President seems to have prorogued the Parliament to prevent or delay this crossover.
The crisis of the present Government is nothing but one of its own making.
Had it been honest in its promise to take action against corruption, the Rajapaksa camp would have now been in disarray. But the UNP seems to have wanted to divide the SLFP by not weakening the Rajapaksa faction of the SLFP. Had the Government also prevented the bond fraud or taken the culprits to task at its initial stage and had they been honest in their promise to create one million job opportunities in five years, there wouldnt have been such an erosion in the UNP vote base.

He had no heart for partying after defeat
	
This local politico elected to a major council in the upcountry from the bud party had cherished high expectations to wear the mayoral robe and he had used his influence to get a well-refurbished office ready in advance.
On being informed, that the new office was ready for occupation, the hopeful had quietly inspected it and expressed his satisfaction too.
However, when the election was held, the man had found to his utter disappointment, there was only one vote cast in his favour and that was his.
The highly dejected politico had left the council premises soon after even without participating in the traditional tea party hosted by the elected one, they say.

House prorogued fearing impeachment motion by UNP: SLPP
	
President Maithripala Sirisena prorogued Parliament because he feared an impeachment motion to be brought against him by the United National Party (UNP) backbenchers, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) said today.
MP Prasanna Ranatunga told a news conference that the UNP backbenchers were planning to submit a impeachment motion against the President.
They are reaching out to other political parties seeking help in this regard. UNP backbenchers approached JO as well. We informed them that if they brought the motion in a proper manner, we May make a decision after submitting a proposal to our leadership committee, he said.
The MP said the gazette to prorogue Parliament had been issued in haste because the time of reconvening Parliament had not been mentioned in it.
Only the date has been mentioned. They behave like infants who cant get a job done properly, he said and added that the unity government cannot be maintained hereafter because the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) has been split into many factions.
The SLFP is barely a proper party now. It is more like a quarter of a party. How can an agreement be maintained between such a small faction and another party to establish a Unity Government When Parliament is reconvened the Speaker decide about the Unity Government which is hanging by a thread, he said.

Issuance of taxi bills a law in two months: NCRS
	
Meters with the facility to issue a printed bill has been made compulsory for three-wheeler taxis from today and it will be legalised in two months, the National Council for Road Safety (NCRS) said.
NCRS Chairman Dr. Sisira Kodagoda told a media conference that it was the responsibility of three-wheeler drivers to issue bills to trishaw users.
This is not an attempt to collect fines for the Government, but an attempt to regulate three-wheeler taxi system and to minimise issues between the three-wheeler driver and the passenger, he said. This will encourage drivers to fix meters in the three-wheel taxis.
However, the existing taxi meters do not have the facility to print bills.
Three-wheelers which already have meters do not need to buy new meters but there should find a way of issuing a bill, Dr. Kodagoda said. Several three-wheeler associations used to issue receipts including with driver name, distance, phone number and total hire amount. Those persons do not need to adopt the new system because their receipts are acceptable.
Dr. Kodagoda said two more months was needed to discuss this with outstation three-wheeler drivers associations, while arranging facilities for them to buy the new meter system, he said. After holding discussions with Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, this will be implemented as a law at national level." (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Leaders approve Charles as Cwealth head
	
The Commonwealth leaders have agreed the appointment of Prince of Wales Charles as the next head of the Commonwealth, the BBC reported a short while ago.
Queen Elizabeth II had said it was her "sincere wish" that Prince Charles would succeed her in the role "one day".
Leaders of the Commonwealth have been discussing the issue at a meeting behind closed doors at Windsor Castle.
The non-hereditary role would not have automatically passed to Prince Charles, with some suggestions it might rotate among the 53 leaders.
Prime Minister Theresa May and Canadian PM Justin Trudeau had earlier given their backing to Prince Charles.
The meeting during a two-day summit involved 46 heads of Commonwealth governments and foreign ministers from the remaining seven countries.

Lets return to traditional rice varieties
	
Have you ever tasted our traditional rice Dont you know that we owned more than 2000 traditional rice varieties and that our ancient generations mainly fed only on these native varieties Our past generations had never experienced diabetes, blood pressure and heart attacks and other non communicable diseases because their healthy environment, dietary habits and lifestyle safeguarded them. But with time, our health has deteriorated mainly due to the consumption of unhealthy diets. Because of these developments, unfortunately we are deliberately loosing most of our valuable food varieties which have nutritional and medicinal values. As a result we are suffering from bad health conditions. According to statistics, the extent of the traditional rice in our country is nearly 0.83 % from the total cultivated area of rice. Actually this is such a disappointing fact regarding our nation since we are associated with a long agricultural history. We depend on polished, non-nutritious rice by neglecting our own precious assets. I think we are not too late to restore our healthy feeding habits with our inestimable indigenous rice because, nutrient rich food plays a critical role in safeguarding women and children from nutrient deficiencies. 
Traditional rice varieties
As the staple food, rice has been performing an amazing role in our country. According to the historical evidences, over 2000 different kinds of rice varieties were cultivated all over the country. Almost all those traditional rice varieties were organically grown which relied on ecofriendly techniques such as crop rotation, green manure, compost, biological pest control and ancient irrigation systems for a sustained water supply. Those methods have preserved the nutritional values and environmental sustainability since there is zero usage of agrochemicals and inorganic fertilizer. A few of the popular traditional rice varieties are Suwendel, Sudu heenati, Kalu heenati, Pachchaperumal, Pokkali, Gurusinghe wee, Kahawanu, Sudu murunga, Unakola samba, Nilkanda, Ma wee, Kuruluthuda etc. 
Adapting
Our traditional rice has higher nutritional values, different texture, appearance, aroma and taste compared to improved rice. But native varieties are low in yield. Therefore, our people try to discover improved varieties with high yield through genetic modification of existing varieties. But with this genetic modification indigenous varieties would lose their nutritional and medicinal properties. In 2010, the Department of Agriculture released 67 improved rice varieties for different agroecological conditions. 
Health benefits
Some epidemiological studies have indicated that the consumption of whole grains rather than the refined grains have varieties of health benefits since whole grains are rich sources of nutrients and phytochemicals such as antioxidants, dietary fiber, vitamins, minerals and fat. Most of these nutrients and phytochemicals are present in the outer layers of the grain and thus the grain refining process leads to a significant loss of these components. These nutrients and bio active compounds are important in the prevention and dietary management of chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory diseases and obesity. Previous studies have recommended whole grains of Ma Wee to get considerable amount of recommended daily dietary protein intake for healthy individuals. Studies conducted on antioxidant properties of traditional rice varieties of Sri Lanka have shown that red rice had significantly high antioxidant properties compared with white rice. 
The major importance of these traditional varieties are its medicinal and nutritional values. According to indigenous medicinal records, traditional doctors have used these native varieties for the preparing of various formulations of herbal medicines. Heenati group is nominated as the mostly used, largely due to the indigenous medicines within. Kalu heenati is the most popular variety in terms of medicines. Moreover, heenati was formulated with various juices to treat diabetic patients while cooked rice of El Wee varieties was used to feed pregnant mothers and also infants due to its easy digestibility and high nutritious values. Furthermore, previous research studies discovered high antioxidant, anti- amylase, anti - glycation and anti-inflammatory properties and nutritional composition of 25 Sri Lankan native rice varieties by comparing with improved varieties. 
Medicinal and nutritional values
1. Suwendel- Contains more carbohydrate, vitamin, fat and micro nutrients. This variety is specially recommended for hard working people. It promotes fair and glowing skin, improves the functioning of the excretory system, enhances the male sexual potency and helps control diabetes, ulcers and constipation. And also it reduces high blood pressure while inducing the nervous system of the human body, specially the nerve cells connected to the eyes and the brain. 
2. Rath el - Suitable to control cirrhosis, virus fever, skin rashes, diabetes, diseases in urinary system and prevents the formation of stones in the urinary system. 
3. Pachchaperumal - Contains more proteins, vitamins, micro nutrients and the grain is rich in antioxidant agents. It helps to cool the body, increases the production of insulin and reduces the production of thyroxin in the body, aids the proper function of excretory system and production of some enzymes and hormones which are needed for the development of red blood cells. In addition it is good for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases like high blood pressure. 
4. Kalu heenati - Rich in minerals and micro nutrients such as iron and zinc and recommended for lactating mothers for daily consumption due to its nutritional value. It enhances immunity, physical strength and male sexual potency. And also its high fiber content helps regulate bowel movement (for example if there is constipation). Moreover, in ancient time, this variety was used as a medicine for diarrhea, diabetes and to lower cholesterol. 
5. Rathu heenati - Grain is rich in iron, zinc and natural antioxidents. It contains more fats. This variety is highly recommended for expecting mothers as well as the first meal of infants while it can be used to treat hepatitis and diarrhea patients. 
6. Sudu heenati- Has high nutritional and medicinal values and is rich in vitamin E, iron, zinc and other natural antioxidants. Studies have proved that this variety is suitable for the treatment of inflammations, diabetes, cancer, neurological diseases, cholesterol, constipation, oxidative stress and helps to improve the human immune system. 
In conclusion, present and new generations of our country are increasingly becoming lethargic, do less fitness and are prone to illness due to their less nutritious diets. These diets are poor in essential nutrients. Rice is our main diet and it is very important to have a healthy life. In the past, our ancestors were fed on a diet comprising precious rice varieties which are loaded with high nutrition and medicinal values. But with the revolution of science and technology, genetically improved new rice varieties are being introduced with main consideration being the high yield. With these new varieties, the current Sri Lankan generation is moving away from our traditional rice varieties. As a result of consuming these new rice varieties which are less nutritious people are suffering with malnutrition problems and other non-communicable diseases. We have enough time to change our unhealthy diet with nutritious meals which were used by our ancient generations. Now our children are highly vulnerable to illnesses and suffer from malnutrition problems. We can protect them from frequent sicknesses to some extent by utilizing our native rice varieties since some indigenous rice has the ability to improve human immune system and provides good nutrition as well as helps to prevent non-communicable diseases through better dietary management.

Lighting of the Hearth at SRI DALADA MALIGAWA
	
The pictures show the procedure adhered to when the Hearth is lit and the milk is boiled 
The rites which are part of the the Sinhala and Hindu New Year celebrations are over. One such rite was the oil anointing ceremonies at the Devales (Places dedicated for the worship of Gods) in Kandy which were held on April 18 (Wednesday). These ceremonies take place in other Devales situated all over the country. 
But have you ever witnessed the lighting of the hearth at the Sri Dalada Maligawa (Temple of the Tooth) Since all are concerned about the lighting of the hearth at their own homes they are not aware that the hearth is also lit at this ancient shrine. Perhaps you are not aware that a ceremony of this nature takes place at this ancient shrine dedicated to the Sacred Tooth Relic. The chief person in charge of this ceremony is the Kariya Korale. In fact he could be called the second-in-command of the Sri Dalada Maligawa. The Kariya Korale is a position that is hereditary. The person who possesses this position is in charge of all the ceremonies that take place withinthe Maligawa. 
It is his duty to prepare the hearth that is lit on the day of the Sinhala and Hindu New Year. He does this at the Drummers Hall or Hewisi Mandapaya ( the area where the drummers are active within the Maligawa when rites are performed). 
Lighting the hearth at the Sri Dalada Maligawa, where the Diyawadana Nilame and the service monks participate during cere monies, is done in the Hewisi Mandapaya. The Drummers Hall is situated somewhat away from the main door. This Hearth is lit about two hours prior to the time given to the rest of the country for this purpose. This year ( 2018 ) the Hearth was lit inside the Sri Dalada Maligawa at 8.14 am. 
Lighting the hearth at the Sri Dalada Maligawa, where the Diyawadana Nilame and the service monks participate during ceremonies, is done in the Hewisi Mandapaya
The Hearth was lit by Diyawadana Nilame Pradeep Nilanga Dela with the blessings of the service monks, who offer their services at the Sri Dalada Maligawa. There are five of them who reside within the Malgiawa. These monks dont reside in their own temples during this service period and stay at the Maligawa. 
The Hearth is prepared by the Kariya Korale. The present incumbent is Karunatilleke.
Diyawadana Nilame Pradeep Nilanga Dela lit the Hearth and placed a pot of milk above to boil. 
The offerings for the Sacred Tooth Relic are prepared within the premises of the Maligawa. These preparation are part of a daily ritual for which the kitchen or Multhen-ge of the Maligawa is used. These foods are never brought from outside. The food is warm when served.

MRIA commercial image damaged by paddy: Official
	
The image of the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA) had been tarnished after storing tons of paddy at the airport premises, a senior official at the MRIA said.
Even after the landing of the world's largest cargo aircraft, Antonov An-225 Mriya on Wednesday, people kept on saying the largest aircraft landed at the Mattala paddy store.
He said MRIA was constructed as an international airport built by the previous Government.
MRIA was internationally and locally a well-recognised airport but the image was tarnished when the Yahapalanaya Government came to office, he said.
Because of storing the paddy several high-sensitivity types of equipment had been damaged from the paddy dust, he said.
However, all damages were paid for by the Government following this unnecessary attempt, he said.
Despite, paddy being removed after January 14, 2016, the Government could not remove the tarnished image, he said.
The cargo terminal which was used to store paddy was refurbished and came into operation since January this year.
Even on social media the same issue was spoken about, he said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

New deal on future of unity govt. to be signed after April 24
	
The SLFP ministerial committee appointed by President Maihtripala Sirisena to look into the future of the unity government has made strong recommendations to drastically bring down the Cost of Living and provide facilities to achieve accelerated development in agriculture, industrial and education sectors and create employment opportunities, committee chairman and Minister Sarath Amunugama said yesterday.
He said a fresh agreement based on the recommendations of the five member cabinet committee will be signed between the UNP and the SLFP after President Maithripala Sirisena returned on April 24.
Minister Amunugama told the Daily Mirror that President Sirisena would discuss the recommendation of the SLFP committee with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe before signing the agreement by the General Secretaries of the UNP and SLFP.
I expect to hand over the committee report to President Sirisena soon after he returns from London on April 24," he added.
The new agreement is not an extension of the agreement signed between the two main parties after the August 2015 General election to form the Yahapalana Government, Minister Amunugama said.
This is basically a strategic arrangement on how the unity government should run in the tenure running for about 18 months up to 2020. We have focused our attention to fulfill the pledges given to the people at the Presidential and general elections in 2015 and made amends to the weaknesses and failures of the Yahapalana Government in the last three years, the Minister stressed.

Ordinary Level Exam results 2017 Reaching a milestone in Sri Lankas education
	
When the results of the much-awaited Ordinary Level Examination were released last week there were very many new aspirations among the students, teachers and administrators in the education sector. 
Several years ago there was criticism levelled against officials of the education sector that all resources- both physical and human- were granted to those schools from the Colombo centric western province and not to the regions.

There is a popular slogan used by school and university students KOLAMBATA KIRI APITA KEKIRI which means while Colombo students get milk the students of schools in the remote parts or regions receive pumpkins. From a broader perspective what this means is that there is a very wide discrepancy between the regions and the centre when it comes to the distribution of resources, especially in the education sector.
However as the years rolled by the timely education reforms introduced, during the past few years, should be commended, irrespective of the government in power. Be it blue or green the tangible fact is that there has been a remarkable improvement in the education sector both in quantity and the quality. 
MATHS, SCIENCE AND ENGLISH pass rate increases while FAIL rate declinesG.C.E.(O.L.) ( See table )

Needless to say the O/L results of 2017 provide testimony more than any other year. 
Table at the end of the article provides an analysis of the performance from 2010 to 2017 at the G.C.E. O/L Examination by the school candidates. It clearly signifies the steady and stableprogress made. 
If you consider the percentage of students that has qualified to study for the Advanced Level Examination since 2010 there is a growth from 60.57% to 73.05% in 2017. 
The Principals of the schools that produced the top six students say that the new systematic developmental tools introduced to the education sector by the Ministry of Education during the past two to three years have contributed to the results emanating from their student communities
If you even analyze from the previous results in 2016 it shows a growth of 3.11% in 2017. 
Also when you take the number of students who have obtained 9 A passes in 2010 the figure read 3057 which is 1.13% of those who passed the O/L exam. In 2017 the total number of students who received 9 A passes were 9960 which is 3.36% of those who passed. 
Moreover there has been a remarkable decrease in the failures at the O/L Exam. The data shows those who had failed in all subjects. Those who appeared for more than 6 or more subjects stood as 14411 in 2010 while in 2017 it has dropped to 7308 which is 50% less compared with the data available for 2010. 
Performance of School Candidates (1st Attempt) by Province arranged in Descending Order of Qualified Percentage
Meanwhile those who have passed Mathematics, Science and English too have increased compared with the previous years results. The pass rate for Mathematics has increased to 67.24% in 2017, up from 62.24% which was the reading for the previous year. 
Similarly the pass rate in Science too rose to 73.465 in 2017 compared to 66.33% the previous year. 
The pass rate in English too has risen to 51.12%, up from 47.90% which was the reading for 2016. 
Incidentally, Southern Province recorded the highest percentage (79.41) of students who qualified to study for the A/L Exam. North Western Province recorded the second highest percentage (74.60) of students who qualified to study for the A/L Exam. Western Province came third with 74.58%. Southern, NWP, WP, and Sabaragamuwa (74.33%) provinces have a higher qualifying rate to study for the A/L Exam compared to the national average which is 73.05% . 
G.C.E. (O.L) Examinations 2016 - 2017 Province 2017 Number Sat for 5 or more subjects Qualified for G.C.E.(A/L) Failed in All Subjects (Appeared for 6 or more Subjects)
More interestingly, when you view the best performers list at the 2017 GCE O/L Examination the top six students who have got the same aggregate comes from Gampaha, Kandy, Matara andRatnapura districts. 

What is the scientific meaning for this It shows the benefits of the education trickle down to regional level from its epic centre which
is Colombo. 
What is the bigger approach for this The Principals of the schools that produced the top six students say that the new systematic developmental tools introduced to the education sector by the Ministry of Education during the past two to three years have contributed to the results emanating from their student communities. They commended the new teacher training methods which are on par with overseas training and modernized teacher training techniques used in other developed countries. The infrastructure for these schools was provided under the concept NEAREST SCHOOL IS THE BEST SCHOOL. In this concept the focus was on the development of infrastructure in over 10,000 schools in the country which included 283 national level schools. The rest of the schools were in the provinces. Currently over 18000 individual projects are being implemented under this scheme. Spending over 64 billion rupees the focus was on introducing mobile science labs to schools with weaker laboratory facilities. As many as 3000 schools were provided with mobile labs apart from training being provided to more science and math teachers. Modern teaching techniques were used so as to have more qualified teachers. The teacher ecosystem too has contributed to the improvement in results. The intention of NSBS projects is to minimize the congestion in popular schools and provide all basic facilities to the nearest school and attract students to those institutes instead of overcrowding popular schools.

Moreover the human capital injected to the system is quite remarkable. Shuffling the teachers after 10 years of service in one school to another is quite a bold decision taken by education officials to supply quality experienced teachers to the peripheries as well. 
More importantly the 13 years of compulsory education that encourages the students to continue studying in schools even after the O/L Exam regardless of whether they pass the exam or not has given more hope to our younger generation. 
Annually approximately 120,000 students drop out after the O/L Examination and their fate goes unattended, some times by their parents who are both employed. And those who dont receive the attention of parents may get attracted to dubious forces. Such dropouts may engage in crimes, get addicted to drugs and find employed as social sex workers. A sizeable percentage of these dropouts also take to driving three-wheeler taxis.

The main objectives of the 13 years of education

Under the proposal of 13 years of continuous education by the present Government, it is intended to allow each learner to continue his or her studies till the end of Grade 13 regardless of whether they pass or fail the GCE O/L Exam.
	To provide an opportunity to select vocational subjects of their choice and allow them either to join the world of work or pursue higher education through flexiblelearning opportunities 
	The introduction of vocational subjects that are in high demand for local and foreign employment. (26 such subjects willbe introduced).
These subjects are:

Child psychology and care 
	Food processing 
	Health and social care 
	Aquatic resource studies 
	Physical education 
	Plantation studies 
	Performing arts 
	Construction studies 
	Event management 
	Automobile studies 
	Arts and crafts 
	Electrical and electronics 
	Interior designing 
	Textile and apparel 
	Fashion designing 
	Metal fabrication 
	Graphic designing 
	Aluminum fabrication 
	Art and designing 
	Software development 
	Landscaping 
	Web development 
	Applied horticulture 
	Tourism and hospitality 
	Livestock studies 
	Environmental studies 
	More Applied Subjects are expected to be introduced depending on future industry demand 
	A student is expected to choose three of those Applied Subjects according to his/her liking and study them up to the introductory and intermediate levels during second and third terms of Grade 12. 
	Then in the first term of Grade 13, every student would choose one particular Applied Subject out of those three and continue his/her advanced studies in that area throughout the three terms during Grade 13. That subject is called students Main Applied Subject. 
	Industrial Skills Training (or On the Job Training  OJT) is related to the Main Applied Subject chosen by a student. Those activities are embedded into Grade 13. 
	Vocational Curriculum would be delivered as per the Vocational Education Standards. 
	Learners would be assessed and evaluated as per the Vocational Education Standards. 
	Vocational Curriculum would allow students to achieve NVQ level 4 in the chosen Main Subject Area 
	A qualification designed by the Ministry of Education and recognized by the country would be awarded to suitably qualified students in the Vocational Stream 
	Students in this stream would be able to find jobs, or start self-employment or to continue their tertiary education in vocation-friendly universities and higher education institutes, institutes in the TVET sector upon leaving the school at the end of Grade 13. 
In conclusion it is very important for the public to understand that improving the quality of education in the country means eventual betterment of the standards of the students and therefore the recently released O/L exam results tells us that success story.

Political office for yet another family member
	
A prominent purohita from Rajarata has already begun conducting public rehearsals to present his younger sibling as a prospective candidate for the upcoming PC polls, they say.
Whenever, the purohita attends a public function or a religious ceremony in the province these days, he would make it a point to take his sibling along with him to introduce him as a prospective runner at the polls round the corner. This sibling already functioning as the purohitas coordinating secretary is said to be already unpopular among the people in the area and the purohita who knows about it is making a bid to present him in a favourable light, they say.
By the way, the practice of appointing family members to high office in the public sector as well as grooming them for political positions at local and national levels resorted to by powerful political authorities has come in for growing public wrath and flak in recent times.

Prisons and (educated)  prisoners: the human factor
	
Prisons are not exactly city attractions. They are somber edifices with high walls and barbed wire. We might see them as we pass but our eyes dont tarry, they move to other and more pleasant objects for perusal. The word prison anyway is uninviting. If the Welikada Prison is an exception to all this it is because of the impressive mural that adorns the wall that faces Base Line Road and especially the bold trilingual affirmation, Prisoners arehuman beings.
Yes, they are, although they are not viewed with adoration. They are there because theyve broken rules and are considered to be threats to societys general well-being. They are there because they have to pay a price for wrongs they have done. They have to do time. And once society has exacted adequate compensation or rather when society deems that theyve repented, reformed and are rehabilitated enough they get to go home, they get tore-enter society.
It takes years for the past to be erased from societys memory and of course the memory of the wrongdoer. Or never, one might add. Of course there are some crimes that are harder than others to forget or forgive, but then again, there are many, many cases where infringement not only brings a prison sentence but also (further) criminalizes the perpetrator in addition to compromising mental well being of the inmates. 
Thats not all. As Albert Camus observed in his celebrated essay against capital punishment for society to pass judgment (through the courts) on anyone, society has to be fundamentally good. That might be taken to be a bit extreme, but if you think about it, in an imperfect society where rules are bent by the powerful, there are probably as many criminals outside prisonsthan inside them.
But lets keep society out of it. There are no perfect societies, after all. The question is, are there perfect justice systems and are there prisons which can truly claim to treat each and every inmate as human beings 
I remember vividly a court moment in 25 years ago. It was at the Panadura High Court. A group of around 15 young people were on trial for sedition and were locked up the court cell (or whatever it is called) until their case came up. In that same waiting facility there was a young couple. The woman had been working as a domestic aide in a house. The man of the house, according to her story, had tried to sexually molest her. At that very moment her husband had arrived (for whatever reason). Livid (according to his story), he had attacked the would-be rapist and had killed him. 
Their case came up. The state-appointed lawyer arrived and claimed he had a bad stomach and pleaded for a different date. The judge obliged; the case was postponed for six months. Just like that, six months were taken from the lives of two individuals who, we are told, are presumed innocent until proven guilty. Thats just a simple story that illustrates just one element of a whole gamut of problems with the justice system. The arbitrariness of releasing suspects on bail, inconsistency in sentencing, privileging of the powerful and not least of all the frivolous nature of pardons leave much to be desired.

Lets get back to prisons. It is not that prisoners are treated like animals. We need to take into account the lack of adequate resources, outdated regulations and rank corruption, all of which are of course not the preserve of the Department of Prisons. National-stink, if you may, wafts all over and prisons, for all their security measures are not impervious. 
So yes, things are not easy for the authorities. There are all kinds of programs in prisons which draw from the assertion on the Welikada wall. Prisoner education is an important part of the process, for example. And yet, theres a lot that can be done despite the constraints. The state and therefore the people pay for prison costs. Sri Lanka does not have private prisons and the state cannot be described as yet in terms of a prison-industrial complex. The costs cannot be fully recovered by value extracted from prisoners. However, if every rupee counts, then prisoners could be seen not just as human beings but as human resources.
There should be a way to monitor the progress of each and every prisoner in the rehabilitation process that has been encrypted into theprison system
Is the human capital thats within prison walls being used effectively, is a question that needs to be asked. While prisoners can be categorized in terms of the nature of the crime, the severity of sentence, race, religion, age etc., they can also be divided in terms of educational attainment and the skills they possess, all of which are meticulously documented.

There are literally thousands of prisoners who have passed their A/Ls. A significant proportion are probably endowed with specialized skills. While it is not possible, obviously, to turn prisons into economic units it is nevertheless worth exploring areas where the quantum of skills can be deployed effectively. Theres value that can be obtained and most importantly such measures would invariably have a positive impact on the mental well-being of the inmates.
One cannot but recall how ex-combatants were rehabilitated, given opportunities to further their education and acquire skills, and then reintegrated into society. In many instances their crimes were far more serious than those of thousands who languish in the prison system. If it was alright for terrorists, why not for others, one might ask. And its not just people with A/L qualifications. There are graduates even inmates who had
post-graduate qualifications. 
One is reminded of the film The Shawshank Redemption where the expertise of a banker, wrongfully convicted of murder, is used by the prison warden for money laundering operations. Thats fiction and the deployment of the relevant expertise was for unlawful activity. However, what the movie also tells us is that there are inmates with exceptional skills that are either not fully used or ill-used or even ignored altogether. 
Theres utter inefficiency, randomness and possibly even corruption in the parole process. Prisoners are interviewed, judgement passed and when committees change the entire process is started from scratch. There should be a way to fast-track things. There should be a way to monitor the progress of each and every prisoner in the rehabilitation process that has been encrypted into the prison system. Good behaviour, proven efforts to better oneself in terms of skill and knowledge acquisition etc., should be factored in systematically. This does not of course mean that the educated prisoner is somehow of a higher moral worth than the rest, but thats not what we are talking about. Its about resource-waste. 
In any event, Ad hoc is never good enough, even if resources are lacking. The film has a scene where a prisoner goes before a parole committee. The stress is on the arbitrary nature of arriving at a decision. Just like in the Panadura court. Months are taken away from peoples lives, years too.
What all this calls for is complete review of the prison system. There are good officers. There are excellent programs concerning prisoner welfare and rehabilitation. Theres a lot of good work being done. Itsnot enough.
Prisoners, let us repeat, are human beings. They constitute part of the nations complement of human resources. They are in prison for a reason, and the state weighs opportunity costs against opportunity benefits when determining to sustain them in prisons over letting them loose on society. All this is understandable. But if it is about understanding then what needs to be taken cognizance of is the fact that people can become better just as they can become worse; and those who fall into the former category should be treated differently, encouraged, and employed in ways that make sense given their knowledge and skills.
Perhaps the ministers overseeing the subjects of justice and prisons can do something to streamline things, to rationalize the entire system and to give more credence to the dictum scrawled on the wall of theWelikada Prison.

Pros  and  Cons of C-Section deliveries
	
maternal care
In certain instances the mother comes with heavy bleeding and in order to save the mothers life we have to go in for a C-section delivery.
Motherhood is one of the biggest milestones in the life of any female. Those 40 weeks of labour pains, body mass gains and other complications are borne with love and courage for the sake of the baby to be born. But at the time of delivery there may be certain complications which might have a risk on the life of the mother or baby or on the lives of both. Therefore normal deliveries may not always take place although it has less risks and complications post-delivery. In this case a Caesarean delivery, also known as C-section delivery, is recommended. April has been officially named as the Caesarean Awareness Month and changing trends show that young mothers request for C-section deliveries with changing attitudes towards pain and other circumstances. Speaking to Health Capsule, Dr. Sanath Lanerolle, Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist explained the instances in which a C-section is required, its risks and complications and how a mother should take care during
post-delivery. 
What is a C-section
A C-section is the delivery of a baby through a surgical incision in the mothers abdomen and uterus. This is often necessary when a vaginal delivery would expose the baby or mother to risk. A C-section delivery may be performed based upon the shape of the mothers pelvis or history of a previous C-section. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends that Caesarean section should be performed only if medically necessary. Some C-sections are also performed at the request of the mother as well. 

There are requests for C-section deliveries at present because it is less painful. But now we can perform a totally pain-free normal delivery provided that there is a trained anesthetist. That is another challenge that -we face because we dont have many trained anesthetists to perform this task
When is it required
According to Dr. Lanerolle there are two occasions during which a mother requires a C-section delivery. One is during emergencies which may arise due to a requirement of the mother or the baby. In certain instances if the babys heart is going to stop or if the babys life is in danger we do C-section to salvage the baby. If the maternal life is in danger, for example if the baby gets stuck during a normal delivery, we have to do a C-section. In certain instances the mother comes with heavy bleeding and in order to save the mothers life we have to go in for a C-section delivery. Certain causes are elective where we predetermine that either the mother or baby cannot withstand the stress of labour. It could also be that going in for a normal delivery could have a risk on the baby as well as the maternal life,saidDr, Lanerolle.
Some other common complications associated with the maternal side are as follows ; 

Narrow pelvis 
	Placenta previa  where the placenta covers the birth passage 
	More than two Caesarean deliveries 
	More than one foetus 
	Cardiac diseases 
  Several risks may be associated with the baby as well. These include ; 
Breech birth 
	Large babies (weighing more than four kilos) 
Risks and complications
There are immediate, intermediate and long term risks. Immediate risks are high when youre doing an emergency C-section delivery when compared to a planned and elective case. 

A C-section delivery may be performed based upon the shape of the mothers pelvis or history of a previous C-section
Immediate risks

Post-partum haemorrhage  Bleeding occurs during the C-section or during the first 24 hours of the delivery (the second most common cause of maternal deaths inSri Lanka) 
	Damage to the boweland bladder
	Blood transfusions  When bleeding occurs a massive blood transfusion needs to be done which will be between 20-30 pints on average. Sometimes the blood may contain HIV and Hepatitis B if notproperly screened. 
	Blood clots  These form in the legs but could be propogated to the lungs and cause immediate death also known as Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). 
	Amniotic fluid embolism  The foetus is in the water (amniotic fluid) and if it goes into the maternal system it would causeimmediate death. 
	Morbidly adherent placenta  This is a condition where the placenta has gone through the uterus and has come through the bladder and sometimes to the abdominal wall. This condition occurs during second and third C-sections. 
Intermediate risks

Infections  This could be in the wound site or in the pelvis also known as pelvic sepsis which is another cause of maternal deaths in Sri Lanka. 
Long term risks

After three C-sections it is not safe to do the fourth 
	Number of children may be limited 
	Infections may lead to infertility 
Normal births are always better, but the risk for the baby is a bit higher than a C-section delivery, but in the case of the mother it is always good to have a normal delivery, Dr. Lanerolle further explained. There are requests for C-section deliveries at present because it is less painful. But now we can perform a totally pain-free normal delivery provided that there is a trained anesthetist. That is another challenge that -we face because we dont have many trained anesthetists to perform this task,said the doctor.
After care

Pain management  Could be done with injections and medicines 
	Early mobilization  During uncomplicated C-section deliveries where mother can eat and drink in order to relieve the blood clots 
	Drink plenty of water  To reduce risks of blood clots, smooth passage of stools and to avoid urine infections 
	Personal hygiene Daily baths are required and the wound needs to be cleaned and dried to avoid the risk of infections 
	Bowel problems and constipation  Eat as many fruits, green leaves and vegetables as possible 
	Anal and Urine incontinence  This occurs in mothers who have gone through an emergency C-section. 
	Breastfeed immediately after the C-section is done
	Wound care  Do not apply any dressings or cream. Absorbable sutures are used. Therefore keep it dry and allow it to heal. 
In his concluding remarks Dr. Lanerolle said that one should be pre-conditioned for a normal labour and the attitude towards pain needs to change. Therefore one need not worry about the pain. If pregnancy is properly managed you need to prepare for labour from the beginning. The mother needs to be informed. Mothers should be empowered. They also need to do some physical and breathing exercises along with a few pelvic flow exercises which will help to deal with the pain. During delivery the mother will be able to push the baby out. Most of the time mothers cannot push strongly and therefore we wold have to use the forceps and vacuum. They should also know that there are painkillers. Epidural analgesia is available for them to have a pain-free labour,he said.

SL should capitalise on location-specific advantages: President
	
Sri Lanka should capitalise on the location-specific advantages and position itself as a hub when the economic boom happens in the Asian Region, President Maithripala Sirisena said at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting on Thursday.
He said Sri Lanka was geographically situated in a strategic location where the busy East-West shipping route passes just about ten nautical miles south of the island.
Every year more than 60,000 ships use this route carrying two-thirds of the worlds oil and half of all container shipments. There were many discussions over making Sri Lanka a maritime hub, he said.
The President said oceans should benefit our people to assist in alleviating poverty, generate employment and promote equity and sustainable development. This is the way to bring in a stable and sustainable future.
In this context, we welcome the adoption of the Commonwealth Blue Charter in our joint efforts to ensure that the Oceans are a shared responsibility and the common heritage of mankind. Sri Lanka is pleased to have the opportunity to serve as a Blue Charter Champion. We remain firmly committed to the full implementation of the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. These are tools to promote sustainable future, President Sirisena said.

STF deployed in Mirissa to ensure tourists' safety: IGP
	
Police Chief Pujith Jayasundara today said the Police Special Task Force (STF) had been deployed in Mirissa to ensure the safety of tourists following the unpleasant incident in which several Dutch tourists were assaulted by locals.
Addressing a press briefing the IGP said that this would be a temporary measure to stabilize the law and order situation in the area until the unrest created by the recent incidents subsided.
He said that an eye-witness had informed them that he would not attend the identification parade that had been arranged by the Matara Court.
IGP Jayasundara explained that though identification parade was not considered essential if it could be held it would make getting a conviction easier.
He also said that he was satisfied with the action taken by the police so far over the Mirissa incident.
He also requested the victims and the eye-witnesses to support their investigations.
During the press briefing Weligama Urban Council Chairman Rehan Jayawickreme praised the Daily Mirror Newspaper for exposing the incident involving the Dutch tourists.
He explained that although the incident was an isolated one, due to the media exposure law enforcement authorities were able to nab the responsible parties.
What I suggest is that we should look at this as an isolated incident but also take this as an opportunity to regulate the rest of the hotels in Mirissa.
Im making a sincere request to all media, if you hear of things like this, the same way the Daily Mirror exposed this story, please inform us, he added.
He also assured the fullest cooperation of their Urban Council to stop such tragic incidents from happening in the future.
Mr. Jayawickreme, also accused the Police of not informing the local government bodies in the area of what had taken place.
The Controversial Water Creatures Beach Guest Restaurant & Surf Bar in Mirissa, where a group of Dutch tourists were subjected to a brutal attack has been temporarily closed down following an order of Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) on Tuesday (17).
The SLTDA said that the owner of the hotel, Harsha Prasanna, in a letter agreed to adhere to the SLTDA order. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Suspended British docs work at Karapitiya resumes
	
The temporally ban imposed on a surgeon from England at the Karapitiya Hospital preventing him from conducting surgeries was lifted last evening on a recommendation made by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), Karapitiya Hospital Director Dr. Jayampathy Senanayake said.
He claimed the British doctor was suspended from performing heart surgeries pending a determination from the SLMC on his practising license.
Dr. Senanayake told Daily Mirror that the issue had been taken up after several doctors attached to the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) observed that the British doctor did not have a licence to practise in the United Kingdom (UK) as it needed to be renewed from time to time.
However, Dr. Senanayaka explained that the said doctor had since obtained SLMC permission to perform surgeries in Sri Lanka and could resume his duties henceforth and added that the SLMC had the sole authority to decide on it.
The GMOA were threatening to resort to trade union action if the authorities failed to take action against this doctor. In the UK, it is necessary for doctors to be registered with their Medical Council. There is also a practising licence which needs to be renewed periodically. However, unlike in the UK, only the SLMCs certification is needed to practice medicine in Sri Lanka, he said. Another claim of the GMOA is that the said British doctor was too old, he added.

Swaziland King renames country 'Kingdom of eSwatini
	
King Mswati III of Swaziland had announced on Wednesday that he was renaming the country as "the Kingdom of eSwatini", BBC reported a short while ago.
The monarch has announced the official change in a stadium during celebrations for the 50th anniversary of Swazi independence. The celebrations also marked the king's 50th birthday.
The new name, eSwatini, means "land of the Swazis". The change was unexpected, but King Mswati has been referring to Swaziland for years as eSwatini.
It was the name the king used when he addressed the UN general assembly in 2017 and at the state opening of the country's parliament in 2014.
He explained that the name had caused some confusion, saying: "Whenever we go abroad, people refer to us as Switzerland."
The BBC's Nomsa Maseko in Swaziland has said the announcement of the name change has angered some in the country, who believe the king should focus more on the nation's sluggish economy.
Swaziland's leadership has been criticised by human rights activists for banning political parties and discriminating against women.

Taxi meters compulsory from today
	
Meters with the capability of issuing a printed bill will be compulsory from today, the National Council for Road Safety (NCRF) said.
NCRF Chairman Dr Sisira Kodagoda told the Daily Mirror that all three-wheeler taxis should have meters by today.
He said they should issue printed bills to passengers indicating the distance, fare and taxi details.
He said a six-month grace period had been given for the three-wheeler owners to install the meters.
The six-month grace period expired on April 1 and the law had to be implemented from that day. But considering the difficulties, he said.
After today, the law would be strictly implemented and stern legal action will be taken against the passenger transport three-wheelers without fare meters, he said.
He said the taxi meter manufacturers had been advised to build their meters according to the standards stipulated by the Transport Ministry.
The taxi meter manufacturers should manufacture according to SLS standards. We cannot interfere with the manufacturing process but the meters should be made according to the given specifications, Dr Kodagoda said.
The maximum cost for a meter should be less than Rs.10, 000 and the meters should be provided to three-wheeler drivers under several installments, if they couldnt pay the full amount upfront, he said.
He said the law was not to exploit three-wheeler drivers but to regulate their service, he said.
He said that the Traffic Police had been advised to fine errant taxi drivers. However, it is learnt that the Police would take no action against the drivers but will warn for a week.
Out of the total of 1,150,000 three-wheelers in the country, only 750,000 three-wheelers serve as passenger taxis. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Tusker Missaka dies from sepsis
	
The Tusker Missaka, that frequented the Yala Sanctuary, died yesterday morning after suffering from a trap gun injury that persisted for over two weeks, park authorities said.
Yala National Park Warden D. P. Siyasinghe speaking to Daily Mirror said the tusker died due to a wound in his left front leg which had gotten worse and injuries sustained by it close to his left eye.
The tusker was found walking around with severe injuries near the Bandu Wewa in close proximity to the Ondaatje Bungalow in Kataragama last Sunday (15), he said.
The 35-years-old tuskers wound had worsened since it was spotted last and the wound had deepened to measure about a foot long and a foot wide, he said.There were two more wounds suffered by it near the left eye which was suspected to have been caused by gunshots, he said.
Three veterinarians, who treated the elephant for three days continuously, observed that the tusker seemed to have sustained these injuries two to three weeks ago.
However, the tusker died from sepsis last morning after a valiant struggle, Mr. Siyasinghe said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Unity Govt.  failed due to subjective factors
	
Yahapalanaya was well aware of this revenue declining situation
I continued to oppose this taxation system
Finance Minister, Mangala Samaraweera, perhaps having apprehended the reality, attempts to make some corrections.
We must find a lasting solution to our problems by ourselves
Let us not create conditions for western powers to intervene or exploit our lapses
we must adhere to an equidistant policy towards India and China
Indias economy, despite its fast growth in the context of the current globalization process, will have to enter a multi-lateral framework with China
Senior veteran politician former Minister and General Secretary of the Communist Party of Sri Lanka D.E.W Gunasekara discussed the current domestic, economic and political situation in the island and the new tax regime introduced from April 1st in an interview with the Dailymirror.
EXCERPTS:
Q You have been in the forefront among tax experts, politicians and economists who campaigned for a new tax regime with far reaching amendments to the tax law. The Government has introduced a new Inland Revenue Act effective from April 1. How do you evaluate the new tax system
I was totally opposed to the taxation system from the very beginning. I showed opposition when Ronnie De Mel as Finance Minister originally moved this new tax regime. This was the starting point of the decline in Government revenue from 24% of the GDP in 1978 to the present level of 12% of the GDP. It continued under all regimes and a 30 year period further escalated our debts while government revenue continued to drop sharply. Finally we had to resort to more debts in order to repay our debts. So,we are now in a debt trap. Yahapalanaya was well aware of this revenue declining situation. On the very 50th day of theYahapalanaya Government, the then Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran allegedly engineered an attempt to increase debts over and above the dictates of the General Treasury. The rest of the story is in the Presidential Commission inquiry report. 
During the past three years, they failed to identify their national priorities. They were well aware that the country has got into a debt trap. How did they behave On the very 50th day of the 100 day programme, the alleged Central Bank Bond Scam took place.
I continued to oppose this taxation system which tax exemption, tax relief, tax amnesties and lowering of tax rates were the order of the day under all administrations based on neo liberal policy prescriptions. In the absence of foreign capital inflows, national savings, accumulation of domestic capital and low Government revenue, the debt was the only way out. This is the crux of the matter which Yahapalanaya totally ignored from the very beginning. The new Finance Minister, Mangala Samaraweera, perhaps having apprehended the reality, attempts to make some corrections. Former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayaka made the situation chaotic, through his pro-capitalist class stance. My speeches in Parliament between 2004  2005 provide evidence in support of my stand on this issue. 
Q The total state revenue was hovering between Rs. 1,700  1,800 billion during the last couple of years. The new tax system expects to increase Government revenue by 100% by 2020. Is this a reachable target
It is a too ambitious a target. I wonder whether the tax administration is well-geared for this gigantic task. The overall performance of the public service, from the perspective of efficiency and delivery is weak. Corruption too has set in. In this context, I am a little pessimistic of these targets being achieved. I wish Mangala all success. 
QHow will the ongoing trade war between economic giants in the likes of US and China affect smaller countries like Sri Lanka
Fears of a trade war are mounting after US President Donald Trump slapped up tariffs on imports from China. Already, there are signs of retaliation by China. Japan has warned that even bilateral free trade with us could be affected. They recommend a multi-lateral framework. In a multi polar world order, protectionism or unit literalism, simply would not work and is prone to be a flop. If Trumps target is China, he will be sadly mistaken. He refuses to see the reality of the on-going change across the world. Before that, he may face impediment. In desperation, he is now resorting to missile wars in instead of trade wars. 
Q The so called western friends (EU Countries) of Sri Lanka like UK, Canada and US have made it a habit to push Sri Lanka to a corner and insisting on the global stage to put into effect the recommendations of the highly controversial resolution passed in 2015 at the UNHRC sessions in Geneva. The resolution includes a so called Credible Domestic Inquiry with the participation of foreign judges. Can Sri Lanka do this without violating the Basic Law in the country
I take a completely different view regarding this whole issue. I was the Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs during the last few days at the end of the conflict in May, 2009. It was I who saw the then Secretary General of UN Ban Kimoon off at the BIA at midnight on May 23. I was quite aware of what all our western friends were up to. This behaviour at the UNHRC was nothing surprising to me. If we had sincerely implemented the LLRC report effectively and expeditiously, we would have been on the offensive now. We failed there and provided an opportunity for our western friends to exploit our weaknesses or failings. 
We must act in keeping with the law of our country. We must find a lasting solution to our problems by ourselves. The world opinion would have been in our favour. India, Russia and China and even a large number of EU countries would have been with us if we took the right path in this exercise. Let us not create conditions for western powers to intervene or exploit our lapses in favour of the global strategists and geo political interests.
Q Though there are many positive features in the newly introduced Local Government Electoral System, it is in a total mess and on many instances the formation of Local Government (LG) bodies on the result of the February 10 LG polls has failed to fulfill the expectations of people. Do you agree
It is necessary to return to its origin. I was a member of the parliamentary Select Committee of 1986 which conceived the new Local Government Electoral System. I along with Dinesh Gunawardana, submitted a dissenting report on certain discriminatory provisions, namely bonus seats and the cut-off point as high as 12 1/2%. We called for a mixed system and to do away with preferential voting system. It took 34 long years for the much needed amendments to be made. In fact, it was the Dinesh Gunawardana Select Committee and under my Ministry of Constitutional Reforms and National Integration that those amendments were recommended. Tampering with these clear cut amendments, the Yahapalana Government doubled the membership of the local bodies to over 8,000. This blunder has created a host of new problems. As in the case of the 19thAmendment, here too was a hasty legislation that has contributed to this mess, confusion and turmoil 
Q The countrys economy is in very bad shape. How and when can we come out of this extremely negative state of affairs
We are living during a time of uncertainty and complexities as far as the global economy is concerned. Bearing that in mind, we must realize the realities of the world order and the worlds balance of power. Our island economy of US$ 80 billion simply cannot ignore the realities of a fast growing Asian economy.

Despite geo-political concerns, we must adhere to an equidistant policy towards India and China. We wont have a future if we pursue anti-Indian or anti-Chinese policy stand. We should not get caught to the intrigues and mechanization of western powers. Let us maintain our traditional friendship with all countries.

Domestically, there wont be any salvation if we do not rely on our natural and human resources. However, our natural resources are limited. In the age of digital revolution, we must equip our human resources with knowledge, vocational training and technology. In the next decade, the Asian economy would be far ahead of all other economies. Here, the decisive factor is the fast growing Chinese economy. Indias economy, despite its fast growth in the context of the current globalization process, will have to enter in to a multi-lateral framework with China for its sustainability. Sri Lanka should dialectically think in those terms with a vision, strategy, and applicable policies. 
Q A new Cabinet has been sworn in with a continuously squabbling bunch of politicians of the divide. Do you think the forward march of the so called Yahapalana Government would be a happy go lucky one
No one knows when the new Cabinet would be sworn in. Even that appears to be in a state of crisis. However, I am pessimistic of their optimism to expect a Happy Go Lucky Yahapalana in the next one and half to two years. It is an opportunity lost for the Government as there were contradictions and confusion. It was also neither a national nor Unity Government. Only Ranil knew its vision, prerogatives, strategy and policies. It was the countrys first experiment of a UNPSLFP led Government. The two major parties in the country are today incapable of administering a Government of its own or through a collective effort. 
During the past three years, they failed to identify their national priorities. They were well aware that the country has got into a debt trap. How did they behave On the very 50th day of the 100 day programme, the alleged Central Bank Bond Scam took place. For three long years, after that, the Prime Minister was stringing his every nerve to safeguard the culprits. Despite two Parliamentary COPE reports and a Presidential Commission inquiry report he continues to hush it up. The spirit of Yahapalana spirited away on the very 50th day of the Government. Even on the No Confidence Motion, which arose as a result of this scam, the Prime Minister preferred to be silent. In retrospect, I now feel that had there been no 19th Amendment to the Constitution, President Maithripala Sirisena would have performed better, his way, using executive powers. 
Q There is no doubt that the ultimate sufferers of this uncertainty in governance are the people of the country who have enough and more problems. Your comments
Yes, I totally agree. The people are at the receiving end. We witnessed this in the lives of the people and now confirmed by the Governments own statistics. Firstly, the lowest segment of the Sri Lanka society accounts for only 4% of the national income while the highest segment accounts for 53%. The income disparity shows the level of poverty and inequality.

Secondly, 60% of our people come from the informal economy, whose Purchasing Power is very weak with mounting needs and wants created by consumerism. Thirdly, the sharp decline in the Government revenue from 24% of the GDP in 1978 to 12% in 2017 has affected the economic growth in an extremely bad way. It is of course a continuous drop of state revenue under all administrations. The trend was quite discernible for long. Foreign Reserves have dried up. The level is sustained by further debts and not by capital inflows. The plight of the people was evidenced by the results of the LG Polls in February. Of course the nature too was unkind to us by way of drought and floods. They also contributed towards the negative results. But the fact remains that the Yahapalanaya Governement has failed miserably in terms of economic management. In this regard a greater share of responsibility has to be borne by the Prime Minister and the UNP who were the mainstays of the Yahapalana Government. 
Q The policies of the UNP and the SLFP are totally different and confrontational in almost all aspects. Do you think the two parties in the Unity Government could co-exist at least till 2020
Already, three years have lapsed. They have failed badly in economic management. Nothing miraculous could happen within the next one and half years under the existing crisis situation. In short and quite bluntly, I would say that their failure was more due to subjective factors than to objective conditions. 
Q The SLFP has been further divided. What would be the future of the party that was formed by late Prime Minister S.W.R.D.Bandaranaike with the objective to bring prosperity, happiness and the social upliftment of the common man
It is unfortunate that the SLFP is in an utter mess with splits and continued inner squabbling. The SLFP has played a historical role in the anti-imperialist democratic struggle. We of the Communist Party dialectically saw the emergence of the SLFP as far back as 1950 and the need for a broader front of progressive and democratic forces to complete and strengthen the anti-imperialist struggle.
We are today facing the new challenges both globally and nationally. Much water has flown under the bridge. The SLFP has not comprehended its present role and its current tasks. I believe that the present political culture brought about by neo-liberalism is the contributory factor towards its present impasse.

What we owe  those who owe us
	
The rise of the Podu Jana Peramuna is, with respect to this demographic, a clear warning signal to the Government 
Theres a school of thought which contends that the world doesnt owe us a cent. Those who side with this thought tend to point out that colonialism, far from exploiting us and draining us of the resources that we have to purchase from the (former) colonisers, often at heftily jacked up prices, actually benefited us. The benefits, apparently, came in a variety of ways; the railway, the telephone service, agriculture and even electricity. What is conveniently forgotten, of course, is that these services were never for one moment conceived to benefit us. They were targeted at the exploiter, because the exploiter naturally thought that his kingdom wouldnt erode. When it did, well, we took over what they bequeathed. And what they bequeathed werent just those services. What they bequeathed include the resource-deficits, broken economy, and a never-ending brain drain.
The world does not owe us a cent because the world has moved on. The world does not owe us a cent because we cant really force them to pay us. But theres a problem. The world that exploited us left behind a self-perpetuating class of landowning elites who continue to make us want to hold a tin cup to everyone else. The services conceived to benefit the coloniser were also conceived to benefit that particular class. It is this class, aptly described and dissected by several social scientists, in various studies done through the years, who are incapable of moving us beyond their landowning worldview. In a pithy, vulgar sense, its the hamu-kolla mindset; we fetch their coconuts, they pay us. 
A paradigm shift
The biggest lesson 2015 taught us is that regime change involves more than just a cursory, superficial change of a government. It involves a paradigm shift in the way we think about transparency, democracy, and good governance. It also involves a paradigm shift in the way we look at the economic base that sustains the rhetoric over good governance, democracy, and transparency. A class that subsists on the easy dollar, that believes in selling off assets at a song and five cents, that has always conceded ground to privatisation, massively, will not be able to consolidate and legitimise a governmental change and transform it into a successful regime change. Such a shift requires the sustained transformation of the way we perceive the material (economics) as well as the abstract (good governance). When the one remains unaddressed, the other, naturally, weakens. 
The other lesson that 2015 taught us was that elites, be they affiliated to institutional cliques or specific social milieus, are not the be-all and end-all of good governance. Gentlemen dont rob, so the saying goes. The sad truth, however and as we all know by now, is that, yes, they do. They just rob in such a manner that the way they evade the law, despite our assumptions about their involvement in such robberies, is hailed by their supporters as being classy and elegant. When gentlemen rob, in other words, their act of robbing is seen as something to celebrate; a confirmation of their affiliation to those institutional cliques and specific social subsets. Reminds me of what Hafeel Farisz once wrote in his interview with C. V. Wigneswaran: that it has been these elites who have pitted collectives against each other in the pursuit of their hazy, expedient goals. 
Same wine in a new bottle 
The young feel disenchanted because they hedged their bets on a meritocratic elite who promised them everything that the bumpkins in Mahinda Rajapaksas administration could not. They lost their bet, because, as the months rolled on, the spokespersons for the regime change, who had done everything in their power to convey to the people the importance of changing the regime, were sidelined in favour of older, spent politicians who were either white collar robbers or members of the previous administration. It was a classic case of the same wine in a new bottle, only this time the millennials were the voters who were experiencing firsthand this needless shift of one set of rogues for another. Fed up, disgusted, these youngsters, who form about a fourth of this country, have vowed for the most to not vote again: they cant go back to Mahinda Rajapaksa because their conscience (being the idealists they are) wont let them, and they are sick of the UNP and the UPFA because neither party has done anything constructive. (This has compelled them to want to leave the country as soon as possible; for them Sri Lanka is beyond saving, beyond redemption.) 
The rise of the Podu Jana Peramuna is, with respect to this demographic, a clear warning signal to the Government, but there too its a temporary trend. I cannot really see the SLPP clinch the presidency in 2020 unless and until the Government continues in the way it does, and even then, the anti-Rajapaksa vote (as Mangala Samaraweera pointed out, though in a rather erratic manner) has increased. No self-respecting government would want to consolidate victory based on how several parties get together against a single entity, but if things go the way they have, 2020 would again be about the hansaya (minus the JVP) pitted against the kesara sinhaya. Pathetic at one level, though expedient at another. In any case, for the kesara sinhaya to rise, it has to convey its message in clearer terms. The gains it has made have been almost fully due to a communication problem with the Government. If that problem is resolved, and if the propaganda machine is well oiled and started, even the SLPP will not be spared. 
But while 2020 will pit the sinhaya against the hansaya, I predict that this will not congeal into the kind of conflict between elites and non-elites that we saw, rather despicably, in the baiyo-toiyo conflict from 2015 to 2017. The idealism of the typical young UNP supporter was the idealism of a middle class, urbane, sophisticated worldview: largely bourgeois, and based on the assumption that the only medicine for the countrys ills lay in the hands of a meritocratic elite which defined itself based on education (as if education was the ONLY criterion on which we could judge politicians and, indeed, human beings in general). What aggravated this conflict was that the Mahinda Rajapaksa administration housed a great many politicos who hailed from a certain social milieu which the stalwarts in the UNP, with their almost homogenous institutional affiliations, claimed to. What blew the balloon was the fact that these stalwarts, who appealed to the young, were blown off, and eventually marginalised. 
So no, the colonisers dont owe us a cent. But the meritocrats do. Big time.

Will boost economy in 100 days if given responsibility: Ravi
	
UNP Assistant Leader and former Minister Ravi Karunanayake said today he could build up the economy in 100 days if he was given the responsibility.
Addressing a meeting held at UNP office in Thotalanga, MP Karunanayake said state officials who go behind politicians do not change with the change of government.
It is they who mess up the country's economy. The action of a few people attached to the government had put the economy in a mess, he said.
Meanwhile, he said it is a common fact that the tusker with sacred relics usually walks in front of a perahera.
However, those who walk in front of the government are political henchmen and stilt walkers. It is they who sabotage the efforts of the President and the Prime Minister to build the economy. Both leaders are aware of this situation, he said.
Referring to the new tax on gold imports, he said the tax was not necessary. (Yohan Perera)

## Title: Workers Can Surely Highlight Their Woes On May 7

Workers Can Surely Highlight Their Woes On May 7
	
The Trade Unions which have grouped together argue that May 1 is the International Workers Day or labour day
It is reported that a group of Trade Unions, offended by the decision to declare May 7 as Workers Day, had decided to protest. This decision to change the date had apparently been taken by President Maitripala Sirisena on the advice of the Maha Nayake Theras who had pointed out that the week following Vesak Poya, which falls on April 29 and 30 will be one of religious observances and therefore, not opportune to have May Day rallies on May 1, immediately after the two Vesak holidays. 
The Trade Unions which have grouped together argue that May 1 is the International Workers Day or Labour Day popularly known as May Day which according to them is universally celebrated as the day on which the workers highlight their woes and voice their legitimate demands and as such it was against international norms and rules to annul the May 1 holiday and instead declare May 7 as the day to mark workers day. The Unions argue that this decision violates the Constitution of Sri Lanka too and say that there were a few occasions in the past, when May Day was celebrated just before or just after Vesak Day. They go on to highlight the historical significance of May Day and that almost all countries have declared May 1 as workers day or labour day. The trade unions have declared that they would defy the Governments decision and hold rallies on May 1. 
It is worthwhile pondering on the historical background of May Day. In early pagan culture of Europe, May 1 was celebrated as the first day of summer and over the centuries, the day was associated with various religious and cultural festivities and celebrations. This day was observed as a spring holiday in the northern hemisphere with varied cultural and religious activities. In the late 19th century, May Day was chosen as International Workers Day by the Socialists and Communist movements of the Second Internationale to commemorate the bombing on May 4, 1886 of a demonstration by workers conducted in support of an eight-hour workday in Chicago known as the Haymarket Affair. Due to the bombing, seven police officers and four workers lost their lives. This celebration also combined with the anti-capitalist movement of that time in England. Since then, the working classes of many countries celebrated May 1 as International Workers Day and several governments recognized the day and declared it as a holiday. However, some countries celebrate workers day on different dates which are significant to them such as in the United States labour day is celebrated on the first Monday of September. This year in England, the May Day holiday has been fixed on May 7, which is aMonday, since May 1 falls on Tuesday. It had been the practice in England over the years that May Day was recognized as a holiday if it fell on a Monday and if not, on another day, usually a Monday was chosen as the May Day holiday. 
Now one may wonder why the trade unions are irked by the decision to declare May 7 as May Day. If the workers wish to highlight the issues that affect them directly or of concern to them, why is it not possible for them to hold their rallies on any holiday in May The message will be effectively put across to the respective authorities if unity among workers is firmly displayed. But what happens in Sri Lanka is that a majority of the unions are affiliated to the major political parties and they participate in May Day rallies organized by the parent political parties who make use of the May Day rallies to demonstrate their strength. There is more disunity than unity among workers when it comes to highlighting their woes. The only unions with sufficient numbers is the plantation workers unions, which too has become aligned to political parties of their choosing. As a result, it is not the aspirations of the workers that are highlighted on May Day but the slogans prepared by political parties. Therefore it is a moot point whether the trade unions have their workers day on May 1 or any other day in May or even for that matter any day in the year. The trade unions are responsible to their members to effectively present the workers grievances and make representations against the policies or practices of the employers that affect them adversely. Instead what we currently see is that the Unions mobilize workers or members against totally unrelated issues and more often than not, missing the woods for the trees where their main issues are not highlighted but the workers are made to respond to the May Day slogans of the political parties they are affiliated to. 
The May Day rallies of the so called socialist countries are also farcical demonstrations where such rallies are used to demonstrate their economic and military might to the world and hardly any worker-grievances are highlighted
The May Day rallies of the so called socialist countries are also farcical demonstrations where such rallies are used to demonstrate their economic and military might to the world and hardly any worker-grievances are highlighted. Due to the shrouded nature of worker conditions, the world hardly gets to know the plight of the workers in those countries because the Unions are State controlled, as are the media. 
The government and the President cannot obviously ignore the advice of the Maha Nayake Theras in respect of religious observances connected with Vesak and the President quite rightly got the Cabinet to approve the shifting of May Day celebrations to May 7. What is the position if Vesak Poya fell on May 1 itself In such a scenario would the trade unions want the Poya Day shifted to some other day to enable them to celebrate May Day In this instance, the rights of the workers and trade unions have not been suppressed and merely allowed another day to conveniently exercise their rights. The unions claim that this rescheduling of May Day is a violation of international norms and our constitution. As explained in previous paragraphs, celebrating May Day on May 1 is not an international norm though prevalent in many countries. The claimed that the Constitution was being violated, maybe hinting at the favoured treatment meted out to Buddhists but there is no discrimination against other faiths in this exercise. Hypothetically, if workers day falls on Christmas day itself, there is no other option for the Government but to reschedule the workers day to some other time. 
Have the Trade Unions lost their marbles or is there a more sinister motive underlying their agitation Only time will tell.
