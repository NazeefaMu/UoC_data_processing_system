Americas new Cyber Strategy and Space Force Whither future of global commons US Sanctions on China
	
The Trump Administration unveiled its brand new strategy for cyber space on the International day of peace declared by the United Nations in 1982. 
The Strategy provides an important insight into how the United States cyber doctrine will evolve and it has significant distinctions from cyber strategies of the previous administration. It aligns with recent American policies of tougher actions against state rivals and faith in leading the world through enhanced force projection. 
The New US Cyber strategy is relevant even for Sri Lanka as are facing a significant turbulent time in global and domestic politics, American security and trade policies seem to be not just giving direction but simultaneously unleashing a wave of disruptions in security events, financial, trade and fiscal sectors. 
Increasing US Sanctions on China, Russia and Iran and expanding trade war with China is creating a stronger dollar through a dollar scarcity for exporters and thus devaluing currencies globally, Sri Lanka is witnessing a rapid nosedive of the Rupee in comparison to the Dollar. 
Currencies such as the British Pound has consistently depreciated against the dollar, estimates are that over the past decade the dollar has risen 50% over the British pound. 
The US Cyber Strategy unveiled by the Trump administration aligns with the recent National Security Strategy unveiled a few months back. The strategy clearly departed with the Obama administrations defence Strategy, it claims, Inter-state strategic competition, not terrorism, is now the primary concern in U.S. national security. 
Recent research points out that terrorist attacks are in decline with a decrease of terror attacks by 27% compared to attacks in 2016. American national security strategy heralds a world of geopolitical contestations and conflicts. Future of US China Relations 
When Harvard Scholar, Graham Allison came up with his recent book, the Thucydides Trap which outlines the possibility of a conflict between the United States and China, many analysts from the United States and China played down the potential of such a conflict. 
Sri Lankas national security challenges in the future and articulating our security policies need a clear understanding of the promise and peril of militarizing global commons
They argued that the two countries had much to benefit from a pragmatic relationship than lose from an adversarial one.
The ongoing trade war that the Trump Administration has unleashed on China and China responding in kind can lead to significant complications shaping the future of China US relations. 
China carried out a concerted campaign to avoid the trade war, by increasing diplomatic efforts, initiatingdialogues with the White House and even pledging that it would increase its purchases of US oil and natural gas products with the hope of offsetting or postponing the trade war. 
What concerns analysts more is the aggressive language that is going into statements emerging from the USA on China and the policy documents. New Trump security strategy clearly identifies China as a major challenger to American National Interests that range from security, governance to trade aspects. 
The US Cyber Strategy of 2018, names China and Russia as perpetrators of cybercrime and espionage.
While the Obama Administration did speak about the Nation States that were involved in cyber offensive postures they did not go to specifically name and link China or Russia as clear adversaries of the United States. 
The 2018 United States national security strategy has fixed China as a perpetual adversary, as it claims that China seeks Indo-Pacific regional hegemony in 
The New Cyber Strategy of the Trump administration will set a dangerous precedent to actively create more and more cyber offensive programs and encourage most cyber security strategies globally to be militarized and pervasive. Former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd writing to the New York Times last week emphasized the importance of understanding the rise of Authoritarian Capitalism and the undermining of democracy and he outlines the effect cyber technologies have in this process, he points that Revolutions in technology threaten democracies ability to cope with the complexity, speed and trajectory of change. 
United States national security strategy has fixed China as a perpetual adversary, as it claims that China seeks Indo-Pacific regional hegemony 
Thus arguing that if we let the market manage the impact of technologies rather than politically manage them we will be in further crises. 
Trump Cyber Strategy 2018, outlines that the US will integrate the use of cyber options across every element of the national power, thus highlighting the intricate link of cyber space with every power property of a nation State. 
China has integrated cyber and information dominance to its national defence policy and it clearly argues that it is developing and modernizing its forces to achieve information dominance. China identifies this process as Revolution of Military Affairs (RMA) with Chinese characteristics. Space Force
Trump administration is not just stopping at militarizing cyberspace and it also is keen on developing a fully-fledged space force, the idea of a space force as the sixth branch of the US military. 
The idea has been met with scepticism from many corners of the US political establishment. Thus a Space force that is independent of the US Airforce or US Navy is what the current administration seeks to establish.

Despite the opposition, the framework is already being made, with estimated budget cost of US $ 19 Billion cost for the first four years of operation, with an initial unveiling of the force slated for 2020 subject to congressional approval. Future of Global Commons
Contemporary conversations on global commons are dominated by Ocean and Maritime security conversations, Sri Lankas security narrative is immensely influenced by the Indo Pacific Ocean concentration where the Sri Lankan government and the defence establishment is focused on creating a coherent maritime strategy. It is imperative that Sri Lanka does create a maritime strategy that is enduring and resilient to the geopolitical challenges, while it is equally important to encompass either space of the global commons when it comes to national security strategy. 
Global commons Oceans, Space and Cyberspace have been subjected to an increasing militarization over the last decade.
The new American national security strategy and Cyber Strategy provides a glimpse of how far nation-states are willing to go to achieve their political objectives, both these strategies are presented as ways of maintaining American hegemony on global affairs and an existential fear of a counter hegemony in the form of China. 
Sri Lankas national security challenges in the future and articulating our security policies need a clear understanding of the promise and peril of militarizing global commons.

Arrest both Nalaka Silva and Namal Kumara : G.L.
	
The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) today urged the government to arrest the Terrorist Investigation Department (TID) DIG Nalaka Silva and Anti-Corruption Force member Namal Kumara in connection with the plot to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena and former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa.
SLPP Chairman G.L. Peiris told a news conference that they believed that there was an attempt to sweep this matter under the carpet.
Initially, Nalaka Silva was transferred to the Police IT Division instead of arresting him and later sent on compulsory leave under mounting pressure. If it was someone else the authorities would have without doubt have him questioned, arrested and produced in court, he said.
Prof. Peiris said Namal Kumara who spilled the beans should also be arrested as he had allegedly collaborated in this plot.
He said if something happened to his life, the whole matter would be buried and insisted that IGP Pujith Jayasundara should step down until investigations were over as otherwise there would be a conflict of interest.
Prof. Peiris also called for the strengthening Mr. Rajapaksa's security. (Kelum Bandara)

Buddhist Saints of the Blessed Isle
	
Only Sri Lanka has many Arahants
Bhikkhu Maliyadeva lived in 6 AD in Mandalaramaka in present Kurunegala -as one of the last identified Maha Arahants
Perhaps with the exception of Lord Buddhas land of birth, there is no other place on earth that can lay claim to a more glittering array of Arahants, who placed their indelible footprints for prosperity other than the blessed isle of Lanka.
A few remarkable anecdotes gleaned from their lives of humility and fathomless wisdom as recorded in the explanatory texts to the Nikayas display the enormity of the individual that stood behind them.
They have projected to the world involuntary though, through each of those episodes the subdued splendour of the profound philosophy presented by successive Buddhas who make their appearance on the human plane in intervals of almost an eternity.
Bhikkhu Maliyadeva, known to have lived in 6 AD in Mandalaramaka temple in a village named Kalla in the District of present Kurunegala is mentioned in the chronicles as one of the last identified Maha Arahants in the land.
Three years into higher ordination, he was still an avid student of Tripitaka as well as a serious practitioner of insight meditation. In one of his alms-rounds in Kalla village, a female devotee developed maternal love towards the mendicant monk while offering a spoonful of soup, invited him in and served him with excellent food. Son, where is your habitation she asked.
Exactly on the day of completion of the retreat, he attained Arahanthood along with the four great powers of analysis (Patisambhida)
When told that he was a student of scripture in Madalaramaka, she volunteered to offer all his midday meals till he completes his scholarly undertaking.

Accepting her offer he regularly partakes of his meal at the upasikas house. On each occasion at the end of the meal he exclaims May you be happy, may you be free of sorrow and then departs. The entire three months of the rains retreat he honoured her with his presence at meal time.
Exactly on the day of completion of the retreat, he attained Arahanthood along with the four great powers of analysis (patisambhida).
On a particular day, the resident Maha Thera of Mandalaramaka temple addressed the Maha Arahant Maliyadeva Friend Mahadeva, people will gather at the temple today, it is good if you offer them the gift of Dhamma, which was tolerated by the latter.
Bhikkhu Maliyadeva, known to have lived in 6 AD in Mandalaramaka temple in a village named Kalla in the District of present Kurunegala is mentioned in the chronicles as one of the last identified Maha Arahants in the land
Young novice monks went up to the lady benefactress of the Maha Arahant to inform her that she should listen to the sermon due to be delivered by her Bhikkhu son at the temple that evening.
Children, she replied, It is not everyone who can preach. The only Dhamma he taught me for three months was to be happy and to be free of sorrow. Please do not play the fool with me, children.
The samaneras insisted Upasika, do not draw inferences on his knowledge or lack of it. Go to the temple and listen to the preaching tonight she remained silent.
However, having gone to the temple in the evening by herself and offering flowers, she stood at the end of the gathering of listeners in the sermon hall.
The daytime preacher aware of his limitations rose from his chair and left.
Arahant Maliyadeva with a colourful Vijinipatha in his hand then climbed the pulpit, recited the opening stanza of his sermon and told himself for the whole of three months I blessed the upasika with two lines, tonight I shall span the entire Tripitaka and explain the purport of those two lines to her, and so did he throughout the night. At break of dawn, termination of the sermon and upasikas attainment of womanhood occurred in unison.
Anguttara Nikaya cites the incident to illustrate the situation of reaching Nibbana by suppression of defilements through constant study and dissemination of Dhamma by a yogi alongside his practice of insight meditation.
Visuddhimagga concludes the episode with the observation that Elder Mahanaga was one of those subject to hate temperament with a tendency to be overwhelmed by the element of light

Back to Arahant Maliyadeva Thera, the tiny wattle and daub kuti the great bhikkhu occupied which one has to enter with bent head, preserved at Arankale hermitage in Kurunegala, remains a stunning symbol of noble monkhood to this day.
The stupendous volume of Buddhas teaching consists of eighty-four thousand thematic monads of which a whole eighty-two thousand were proclamations of the Blessed One Himself. The rest consisted of expositions of the Dhamma by Maha Arahants the erudite scholars, great disciples with absolute mastery of the great teaching. One such was Punna, son of a Brahmin lady names Manthani, sister of Kondanna Thera, and later designated the most colourful preacher of the dispensation by Gauthama Buddha.
Arahant Punna on a request made by the General of DhammaVenerable Sariputta to explain the seven stages of purification, made a brilliant exposition of it not realizing that it was Venerable Sariputta who made the request.
It was subsequently termed the Relay of the Chariots that formed the basis of the legendary treatise Visuddhimagga of Badhantacharya Buddhagosha.
When a practitioner progresses on his path of insight meditation he reaches a stage where he observes a bright illumination in front of him. As explained in the text it is termed the stage of tender insight indicative of suppression of defilements, and if one is not diligent he could misguide himself that he has succeeded in penetrating the truth.
It is a distraction and is one of the ten imperfections that lie on the path. The ability of the mediator to distinguish at this stage between the path and what is not the path is the fifth of the seven purifications mentioned above.
Perhaps the most sensational example of this almost imperceptible state of confusion was also exhibited in ancient Lanka. In Thalangara temple lived a Maha Arahant named Dhammadinna, possessed of the four categories of discrimination siwpilisimbiya, expounding the great philosophy to a large community of bhikkhus. A particular day while in his daytime quarters on wondering whether his teacher the Elder Mahanaga living at Ukkavila has brought his monkhood to fruition saw that he was still an ordinary man and if he does not visit him he would die an ordinary man. Rising into the air he alighted near the Elder who was himself spending the time in his daytime quarters.
The Arahant paid homage to him, performed his respectful duties and sat at his side. Friend, what brought you here at this unusual hour the Elder asked.

Venerable Sir, I have come to ask a question. Ask friend, if I know I shall reply, the Elder said. A thousand questions were asked.
All thousand of them were answered without a pause. The Elder was told his knowledge indeed was sharp and was questioned as to when this particular state was attained by him. Sixty years ago, friend he replied. Do you practise concentration, Venerable Sir That is not difficult, friend, he said.
Then, Venerable Sir, do create an elephant, and a white elephant was created by the elder. Now sir, make him come towards you quickly. He made it thunder towards him trumpeting aloud, ears outstretched, tail straightened and the trunk buried in its mouth. At the horrific sight of the enraged beast rushing towards him, the Elder sprang to his feet in order to flee. The Arahant held him by the corner of his robe, Venerable Sir, are Arahants ever frightened he said.
Awakened to reality the Elder knelt at the Arahants feet pleading Dhammadinna, please come to my rescue Venerable Sir, entertain no doubts whatsoever I came here exactly for that purpose, replied the Arahant and gave him a meditation topic. Having taken the meditation topic the Elder went up to the walk and reached Arahantship on the third footstep. Visuddhimagga concludes the episode with the observation that Elder Mahanaga was one of those subject to hate temperament with a tendency to be overwhelmed by the element of light.
To the noble bhikkhu who has comprehended the stark nature of life, the inherent insecurity of human existence and the need to abide by a meticulous regimen of virtue (Sila) to fulfil his lifetime ambition, even the prospect of death is of no concern at all. Violation of site entails far greater consequences than mere termination of life. The case of Ambakathaka Tissa of Ciragubha is in point.
Embarked on a long journey during a period of famine he failed to receive his midday meal from a single household. Exhausted, he sat down in the shade of a mango tree with ripe fruits lying around. He wouldnt eat them since there was none to offer them to him. Partaking of food unoffered is a prohibition imposed upon a Buddhist monk.
A passerby who saw the prostrate monk went up to him and squeezed a mango into his mouth, to no avail. He then took the limp body onto his shoulder and proceeded to his village. Midway through, the monk came to and advised himself This man is no father, mother or brother of yours, nor is he your relative. He does this entirely on account of your untrammelled Sila. Augmenting insight meditation in quick succession he attained Arahantship still on the strangers back. Lankas ancient history abounds with such fascinating accounts.
Elder Sangharakkhitha the Great, past sixty years of age was lying in his death-bed. When monks queried about his supramundane state, he replied: I have no supramundane state. The child bhikkhu attending on him said: Venerable Sir, people have gathered up to a twelve yoththa assuming you have passed into parinirvana and they would be disappointed to hear you have died in the ordinary state. The Elder replied Friends, wanting to see Metteya Buddha I didnt develop insight. Lend me a hand to set myself up, then.
Just as the child monk who helped him to it up was moving away, the Elder reached the zenithal state and gave a signal by snapping his fingers. The assembled Bhikkhus said to him Venerable Sir, you have performed a difficult a task by achieving the supramundane state in the hour of death.
That wasnt difficult friends, I will tell you what is difficult. From the day of going forth, I do not recollect an instance where I did anything unknowingly and without the presence of mind. His nephew to pass away at fifty years of age in the same manner.
In need necessarily be said that it is the sacred duty of the Bhikkhu Order today to establish a Supreme Sangha Council invested with wide-ranging powers to safeguard the great religion that has inspired the human spirit for centuries against the insidious attacks presently being directed at it from within and without.

CC remain defunct as no quorum
	
The Constitutional Council (CC), which makes recommendations for the appointments of Independent Commissions and key appointments in the State sector, remain defunct virtually as six out of seven slots reserved for nominated members have not been filled at the moment, it is learnt.
The CC is a body that consists of ten members. Seven are nominated members. The three others - the Speaker, the Prime Minister and the Opposition Leader - are ex officio members.
The three-year term of seven nominated members ended recently. However, only President Maithripala Sirisena has nominated Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe as his representative to the CC at the moment. Accordingly, there are four members of the CC now in place.
According to parliamentary sources, the CC cannot hold its meetings until another member is nominated to meet the quorum of five.
The Prime Minister and the Opposition Leader are required to nominate their representatives from among parliamentarians. Besides, another parliamentarian should be appointed to represent the parties in Parliament which the Prime Minister or the Opposition Leader do not belong to.
Also, three representatives should be nominated to represent civil society. Previously, A. T. Ariyaratne, Radhika Coomaraswamy and Sibly Aziz served in the CC as civil society representatives.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Speaker Karu Jayasuriya held a meeting recently to work out the modalities for the selection of three civil society members. For this purpose, civil society organizations such as PAFFREL are to be consulted. (Kelum Bandara)

Conquer your  anger In Buddhism, anger is not approved and accepted as positive
	
Anger is a cause of harm. Anger stirs up mental turmoil
Anger gradually obliterates both mental and physical energy
Anger is a negative and destructive emotion which has caused much misery in our lives and also around the globe. 
Anger is an unwholesome mental disposition that exasperates untamed mind. It takes us to dark and complexity. 
However, anger can get out of control and become destructive and problematic. 
So why do we get angry People get angry when their expectations are not met - whether those expectations are about the future, about themselves, or about others. 
When our expectations are unmet, we revert to illusions of control, Unrealistically expecting all people to behave and all situations to turn out as we think they should. 
Anger over these unmet expectations often leads us to blame others and shift aggression towards them.

Some eminent scholars and professionals who are in the domain of psychology explain that there are several sources of anger: physiological, cognitive, and behavioural. 
Physiological anger is natural anger. 
In certain threatening situations, for instance, when we are attacked physically, our bodies respond by making us physically angry. Cognitive sources of anger are based on how we perceive things. These perceptions may be accurate...a situation may, indeed, be threatening, or they may not be. 
Sometimes we will perceive a threat, even though the external situation is not actually as dangerous as we think it is.
In other words, there may be no real reason for anger, but our personal biases and emotions take over, leading to aggression. Finally, behavioural sources of anger come from the environment we create for ourselves. Chronically angry people create an atmosphere in which others become aggressive in return, creating a cycle of anger. 
It is amazing that most scholars and educated people especially those who are in the domain of psychology endeavour to find avenues and solutions to help individuals who deeply suffer themselves from ANGER. 
The Great Master, the Buddha said: 
Anger is a cause of harm. Anger stirs up mental turmoil. People do not recognize the peril that has arisen from within
Those who are constantly dwelling with anger not only destroy themselves but also hurt and harm others
The angry person does not know the good. The angry person does not see the Dhamma There is just blindness and dense gloom when anger overcomes a person
In Buddhism, anger is not approved and accepted as positive. 
Anger is impure, noxious, unhealthy, harmful and dangerous emotion and temperament. The Buddha has always taught and encouraged people not to associate with and harbour any thought of anger at all. 
Those who are constantly dwelling with anger not only destroy themselves but also hurt and harm others. Anger is the most atrocious defilement and despicable virulent thought. Anger gradually obliterates both mental and physical energy and leads to various afflictions and disorders. 
Unfortunately, those who are ignited and inflamed with anger never understand the negative consequences and repercussions which they will ultimately face here and hereafter. 
Be very conscious, careful and mindful of the toxic thoughts which you associate with. May the intellectuals find their education helpful when dealing with anger and underlying disposition. Most people tend to ignore the detrimental gravity of their anger. 
Monks, what is the person whose mind is like an open sore Here, some person is prone to anger and easily exasperated. Even if he is criticized slightly he loses his temper and becomes irritated, hostile, and stubborn; he displays and discloses irritation, hatred, and bitterness. Just as a festering sore, if struck by a stick or a shard, will discharge even more matter, so too some person here is prone to angerand displays irritation, hatred, and bitterness. This person is said to have a mind like an open sore. (The Buddha  AN) 
The wise person should eradicate this unwholesome quality.
In such a way one should train in the Dhamma: do not yield to recalcitrance.
Free from anger, their misery is gone,
Free from delusion, no longer avid, tamed, having abandoned anger,
The taintless ones attain Nibbana.
(The Buddha  AN) 
Bhikkhus, there are these five ways of removing resentment by which a bhikkhu should entirely remove resentment when it has arisen toward anyone. What five
1. One should develop loving-kindness for the person one resents; in this way, one should remove the resentment toward that person.
2. One should develop compassion for the person one resents; in this way, one should remove the resentment toward that person.
3. One should develop equanimity toward the person one resents; in this way, one should remove the resentment toward that person.
4. One should disregard the person one resents and pay no attention to him; in this way, one should remove the resentment toward that person.
5. One should apply the idea of the ownership of kamma to the person one resents, thus: This venerable one is the owner of his kamma, the heir of his kamma; he has kamma as his origin, kamma as his relative, kamma as his resort; he will be the heir of any kamma he does, good or bad;
In this way, one should remove the resentment toward that person. These are the five ways of removing resentment by which a bhikkhu should entirely remove resentment when it has arisen toward anyone. (The Buddha  AN) 
The great master, the Buddha has kindly taught us the danger of anger and resentment. Even though they listen to hundreds of sermons and associate with many gurus most of them are incapable to manage their anger and people have created disastrous and unfathomable situations in our human society. 
Unfortunately, they do not know the danger of retributions of their hared acts. Whether they believe it or not, no one can escape from the result of the Karma. It is inescapable and unavoidable.

Failed Neo-liberal paradigm Poverty and inequality continue as persistent, unjust, socio-economic is
	
No definition of poverty can ever hope to truly fathom with accuracy what it really means to be poor
	Globalisation is the intensification of worldwide links and affects distant, far away, localities
	Globalisation has no space for people-centred ideologies
In his 2013 Apostolic Exhortation, EVANGELII GAUDIUM, Pope Francis, firmly and eloquently drew the attention of all global leaders, big and small, to fight poverty and growing inequality with the sharpest words and phrases ever, on the dominant economic system, which he pointed out derives from the tyranny of unfettered capitalism and the ideology of money.
The world is at present mid-way into the second decade of the 21st Century, yet, still lacking the political will and moral courage and resolve, to delve deep into the policies, and structures that perpetuates poverty and inequality; And to conscientiously adopt whatever socio-economic adjustments and policy changes that are imperative, in order to end the scourge affecting the lives of billions of human beings on the face of this earth.
The fact is that no definition of poverty can ever hope to truly fathom with accuracy what it really means to be poor  the misery, the degradation, the squalor, the helplessness, the desperation, the powerlessness, and the callous oppression in many forms experienced. Perhaps, the only way of truly grasping what it actually means to people who are condemned to suffer it, is, to examine with empathy and sensitivity the lives of the poor around us.
Thus, Pope Francis made a point in this context by alluding to the irony of the difference in the manner in which we react to a news item of an elderly homeless man who dies of exposure to the harsh elements, and, the news item of the stock market losing two-points !!
Nearly two decades ago, Anthony Giddens in his celebrated book entitled The Consequences of Modernity, (Cambridge; Polity Press, 1990), described globalization, the twin partner of unfettered Capitalism, as the primary cause of all the socio-economic and political issues that are bedevilling mankind at present.
He defined globalisation, as the intensification of worldwide social relations which linked distant, far away, localities in such a way, that local happenings are shaped by events occurring many miles away and vice-versa.
Pope Francis, made a point in this context by alluding to the irony of the difference in the manner in which we react to a news item of an elderly homeless man who dies of exposure to the harsh elements, and, the news item of the stock market losing two-points
As many enlightened people know and remember Globalised Capitalism is quite a different kettle of fish to the wave of internationalism that blew across the globe for many years.
When globalization arrived, it brought with it a trail of different multidimensional agendas, one of which was the integration of real national economies with world capitalism, leading to the latters geographical reach spreading within a short period of time.
It not merely confined itself to gripping the local economic sphere, but, more pertinently, impinged on a wide range of existing local socio-economic and political institutions and their policies, no less, on the culture and style of living traditions and values.
These influences gradually became hegemonic, with the ability and strength to force changes in the power structures and balances of societies in decision-making mechanisms and governance.
Following these changes, radical changes came about in the political philosophy, ideological constructs, institutions and processes in society, social organizations, and, far more damagingly, in the way people relate to each other in public, in private and in their personal life, which resulted in the fractured societies and the now chaotic world we live in today.
The print and electronic media present daily, heart-rending scenes of restless youth, frustrated students, underpaid workers, forced workers, abducted workers, wounded young and old women, child-labour and child-soldiers, and alarmingly, oppressed and silenced intellectuals, academics, and civil society activists, mainly Journalists.
Any innovative alternatives to capitalist development can be evolved ONLY when the background and magnitude of the present crises are understood and realised.
Globalisation has no space for people-centred ideologies and socio-economic policies which are challenged, distributed, and emptied of their real relevance. The market and capital must dominate the world of intellectual discourse, not the compelling issues of the vast majority of the global population, even if billions have to go to bed hungry.
The worship of the ancient biblical Golden Calf has returned in a new and ruthless guise in the idolatry of money and dictatorship of an impersonal economy, lacking a truly human purpose, wrote Pope Francis; The worldwide crisis affecting finance and the economy lays bare their imbalances and, above all, their real concern for Human Beings.
Poverty alleviation projects with a plethora of high-sounding names have been formulated at huge costs for implementation in response to the widespread evidence of prevailing poverty in practically every country sitting in the United Nations. These are supremely mere palliatives, and considering the magnitude of the global problem they are by no means a substitute for a genuine, determined, and committed fight against poverty and inequality.
The world today, for those who have eyes to see, and ears to hear and for intelligent and objective observers, has sunk into decadence, economically, socially, culturally, morally, ethically, and seems to be immersed in a quagmire of unprecedented superficiality.
There are wars among nations, ethnic and religious groups, social upheavals between haves and have-nots, heinous forms of crimes, domestic violence, political violence, break down of law and order, revolution and counter-revolution; corruption by the mightiest, politicians, bankers, and businessmen, blatant violations of time-honoured principles and codes of conduct and decency; blatant violations of constitutions, democracy, the judiciary and the executive organs of administration. Even religious institutions are not exempt.
All of these have emerged, slowly but surely, as the inevitable consequences of a model of development that harshly treads on all alternative models of development, and imposed itself through-out the world. This model has been intrinsically exploitive of nations and people with little power between nations and of course within nations, and ruthlessly, the environment of our planet as well. That is precisely why Pope Francis was constrained to remark that, unfettered capitalism is an amoral pursuit where the guiding stars, were not good or bad, but only, profit and loss, which will be harder to sustain, sooner than later.
The world remains in this chaotic state because, we, the people, are now experiencing an existential vacuum. We are confused, distracted, uninterested, selfish, self-centred and self-absorbed. It is imperative that all peoples wake-up to this reality before there is some form of universal calamity. Governments, civil society, and religious organizations should actively engage themselves in developing and promoting a more just and sustainable model and style of living, not by rhetoric but by example. It is the bounden duty and responsibility of intellectuals, professionals, businessmen, academics, politicians in particular, and religious leaders to wake-up and comes to the aid of the world and its people that are in a state of anguish.

Govt. likely to cut imports by US$500 Mn to $1 Bn: PM
	
The government may have to curtail imports by US $500 million to US $1 billion because of the current economic circumstances, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.
The Prime Minister who attended the opening of D.S. Senanayake Gama in Hambantota said Sri Lanka would have to do so by increasing import duty.
We are discussing various forms of debt management with the Minister of Finance and had a discussion last week as well. What we intend doing is to limit imports by at least US$500 million or by US$1 billion and do so by increasing import duties, he said. The industrial production in the US has increased. People there tend to spend more on purchases because of concessions given by President Trump. Interest rates in the USA have been increased lately. This has encouraged the investors to pump more funds into that county. Those who invested in Sri Lankan stock exchange had pulled out US$400 million. It is obvious that any businessman will invest in markets where the returns are high.
The Prime Minister said this was not a problem started by this government but that the concessions given by the Trump administration and his decision to increase interest rates have created this issue.
"This has affected other countries, the Euro, Malaysian Ringgit, Philippines Peso, Indian Rupee and our rupee had gone down in value. Some countries have increased their interest rates. However Sri Lanka cannot do it because the investors will have to pay a higher rate for their borrowings, he said. Sri Lankas exports have not increased lately. We have been exporting commodities such as tea and apparels since 1977. Therefore it is essential for Sri Lanka to go in for new exports.
Referring to the oil price issue, the Prime Minister said the price had gone up as a result of US sanctions on Russia and Iranian oil and pointed out that the oil price issue where Sri Lanka is concerned was two sided -- sanctions and the devaluation of the rupee.
However, he said there was some relief because Saudi Arabia had assured it would release 1.5 million barrels of oil daily into the market within the next six months and that this was a relief because the world market would have otherwise lost the daily supply of 1.1 million barrels of Iranian oil.
In a response to a statement made by former president Mahinda Rajapaksa as to how the government would handle this situation, the Prime Minister said, I like to ask the former president why his government went for commercial borrowings to invest in nonproductive projects."
He assured the people that this government would not run away from the challenges it was faced with and would resolve them.
I was handed over an economy which recorded a negative growth. I resolved it. I will resolve the present crisis as well. Therefore I request the people to trust me, he said. (Yohan Perera in Hambantota)

Maldives election: Opposition leader claims victory
	
Maldives opposition leader Ibrahim Mohamed Solih has declared victory in Sunday's presidential election, urging strongman incumbent Abdulla Yameen to ensure a peaceful transition of power and immediately release scores of political prisoners.
"I call on Yameen to respect the will of the people and bring about a peaceful, smooth transfer of power," Solih said on national television shortly after official results showed he had an unassailable 58 percent of the popular vote.
"The message is loud and clear. People want justice and stability and we will ensure accountability," he added.
Solih had the backing of a united opposition trying to oust Yameen but struggled for visibility with the electorate, with local media fearful of falling foul of heavy-handed decrees and reporting restrictions.
Preliminary results released by two private media outlets placed Solih in the lead with 58.1 percent of the vote in the two man race, with around half of all ballots counted.
The Mihaaru and Avas news websites said their tallies were based on official results published by ballot stations across the country.
Yameen, who was widely tipped to retain power, has imprisoned or forced into exile almost all of his main rivals.
The poll is being closely watched by regional rivals India and China, who are jostling to influence Indian Ocean nations. The European Union and United States, meanwhile, have threatened sanctions if the vote is not free and fair.
Many voters across the Indian Ocean archipelago said they stood in line for over five hours to cast their ballots, while expatriate Maldivians voted in neighbouring Sri Lanka and India.(The Telegraph)

Reflections on Binara Poya Buddhism:Least prejudiced against women
	
The so-called Garudhamma convention, an approval of womens inferior competence, are yet to be fully scrutinized
	Buddhas open invitation to women to the Sasana gave them ample opportunities for public life and had greatly improved the status.
	But little has been written about the changing status of women Buddhist societies

The Buddhas open invitation for women to participate in the Sasana by making them eligible to enter the Bhikkuni Sangha with ample opportunities for public life had greatly improved the status of women. In Islamic and Hindu societies a number of books have been authored on the changing status of women, but strangely little in Buddhismapart from Miss I.B. Horner, Pali scholar, who wrote the book titled, Women under Primitive Buddhism, in 1930. The Buddhas teachings undoubtedly have the least biased approach against women. Their importance to society was acknowledged very much enhancing their standing among men.
Jambudweepas Binara-malees -Maha Prajapati and Theri Kundalakesi
They were admitted to Sasana as Bhikkhunis on Binara Poya.
The haunting beauty of maestro Amaradevas melodious voice singing Dalton Alwis lines based on Kundalakesi in an adaptation of the story of Mehenni (female monk); the scintillating song with its own magical impact gives immense and delicate joy
Neela warala nil chamara pawan salannikundalakesi kundalakesi
Protagonist Kundalakesi (Woman with curls) whose birth name is Badra, was born in a business family in the city of Puhar.
After losing her mother during childhood, Badra lives a sheltered life. One day, from her balcony she spotted a bandit being paraded before execution in her hometown; and it was love at first sight. As she fell in love, Bhadra begged her father to save the thief, named Kaalan, who had been sentenced to death for banditry. Strangely, the father obliges, he appeals to the king for the bandits release, for which he had to pay the treasury in gold [Kaalans weight] and 81 elephants. [Fathers in the time of Buddhabroad-minded and loved their daughters so much that they were obliged to make them happy at any cost or were they stupid, idiotic and lacked good judgment and careful thought, is something that warrants socio-historical profound research on] Badra alias Kundalakesi married Kaalan but did they live happily ever after
She loved her former bandit husband very much; One day, she teasingly refers to the husband as a thief. This angers the temperamental Kaalan who was marking time for an opportunity to satisfy his inbred craving for valuables. His attraction to her jewellery motivates him; he decides to kill his wife and suggests visiting the peak of a nearby hill.
The rogue coaxed her to wear of her expensive jewellery and accompany him saying that he wanted to perform a vow at the guardian deity of the place because it was that deity who had saved him from death. Captivated by the exquisiteness of the forest, waterfalls, fauna and flora and birds singing as they trek through a jungle terrain [Those who watched the traditional style opera Kundalakesi of Mahagama Sekara fame .would remember as it folds],the coupleforgetting all anxieties, tensions and worries sings that heart-warming Sekara lyrics to melodious rhythm of Somadasa Alwitigala
Sundara me wana thulma yahan geba // aadara bas kiyanaHanda devi dekan pinana Anna balan sanda ran ketiyen ena seethe sunil dahara
On reaching the summit, he declares his plan to rob her of all the jewellery that he enticed her to wear on the journey and kill her. Kundalakesi is shaken but wisdom arose in her and pleaded with him to grant a final wish  that she wishes to pay reverence to her husband by going around him three times before she dies. He grants her wish when she gets behind him, Kundalakesi moves forward and pushed him off the summit.
Admission of Nuns- Bhikkhuni Order
The most important happening on Binara Poya day was the admission of Nuns to the Sasana or founding of the Bhikkuni Order. The Buddha allowed the admission of female candidates to the order following Maha Prajapati Gotamis commitment and determination in making several requests. Prajapati Gotami, a role model for women-folk was the sister of Queen Mahamaya, Buddhas mother..
The Buddhas judgment in the fifth year after his enlightenment in sanctioning the establishment of an Order for women was stained by the inclusion of garudhammas imposed on them. Incorporated in the Bhikkhuni Vinaya the rules are nothing but attachments by male chauvinists later. It is a blatant subordination of Bhikkhunis to Bhikkhus.
The Buddha during this time was residing at Nigrodharamaya in Kapilavasthu when she approached him and requested consent for women to enter the Sasana.
The Buddha after turning down the request three times finally allowed the admission to the order on conditions they say. It was granted on a Binara full moon Day. Among prejudiced religious practices, Buddhism can definitely claim to have the least prejudices against women.
What does womanhood matter at all, when the mind is concentrated well when knowledge flows on steadily as one sees correctly into Dhamma. One to whom it might occur, I am a woman or I am a man or Im anything at all is fit for Mara to address..  Nun Sona verses Mara. Garudhamma-- Male Chauvinist attachments
In Asian Buddhist societies, in spite of the objectives of the Buddha, controlling is done by men. The approach of people in a system found, virtually every faction of Buddhism seems to have fashioned a level of gender bias. This resulted in the loss of female monks in both traditions. The Buddha enlightened us on generally accepted concepts like against the stream.
The so-called Garudhamma convention, an approval of womens inferior competence, are yet to be fully scrutinized.
The proclamation that a woman cannot become a Buddha was in all probability rather a gentle opinion, carrying no significant consequence on prospects of women practitioners.
They only promote gender bias and not Buddhism. The Mahayanists, in contrast, believe women possess an equal capability for development on the path to achieve awakening.
O Gotami, said the blessed one, perform a miracle in order to answer the misconceptions of those badly informed men who do not recognize the spiritual abilities of women.
The Buddha after turning down the request three times finally allowed the admission to the order on conditions they say. It was granted on a Binara full moon Day. Among prejudiced religious practices, Buddhism can definitely claim to have the least prejudices against women.
The above statement contradicts Garudhammas, which is an obvious imagination of Male Chauvinists.
The Buddhas judgment in the fifth year after his enlightenment in sanctioning the establishment of an Order for Women was stained by the inclusion of garudhammas imposed on them. Incorporated in the Bhikkhuni Vinaya the rules are nothing but attachments by male chauvinists later. It is a blatant subordination of Bhikkhunis to Bhikkhus.
Rule number four recognized the intimidation to which Bhikkhunis would be exposed. Concessions to male superiority are seen in Rules 1 and 8. Rule 1 has been the most annoying in practical terms and obviously embarrassing in societies where the salutation practice was strict. Why should a Bhikkhuni always pay respect to a Bhikkhu however junior the latter may have been Chronicle says Prajpati Gotami sought an exemption from this rule that but was unsuccessful, despite Ananda Theras support. Evidently, they are not backed by Buddhas idea or conception.
The eight rules are--
1. Irrespective of any other considerations like seniority and age, Bhikkhus to have precedence over Bhikkhunis in matters of salutation
2. Bhikkhunis has to observe the annual vassana in a district where there were Bhikkhus.
3. It is the male Bhikkhus who set the dates for Bhikkhuni Uposatha.
4. An assembly of both Bhikkhus and Bhikkhunis is a must when Confessing lapses by Bhikkhuni.
5. Both the Sanghas to undertake Judicial processes in case of Bikkhunis.
6. Upasampada commencement of Bhikkhunis to be given by the Bhikkhu Sangha too.
7. A Bhikkhuni should never abuse a Bhikkhu.
8. Bhikkhunis to be admonished by Bhikkhus, but not vice versa.
Kundalakesi, being guilty of matricide, and regretful of her actions in killing her husband, she leaves all her jewellery in the zenith of the hill and enters the city where she became to be known as Jambuka Paribbajika as she walked extensively in Jambudweepa, she even challenged anyone to compete.
Kundalakesi meets Sariputta Thera in Sravasti, and begs him to teach her the Dhamma. Sariputta wanted her to become a Bhikkhuni; she was ordained Theri Kundalakesi on Binara full moon. She gained arhantship in a very short time and engaged in spreading the Buddha Dhamma for the rest of her life. The puzzled Bhikkhus asked the Buddha, how come a woman who killed her husband achieve the status; to achieve supreme bliss after listening to the Dhamma only so little
The Buddha said:
Better than the recitation of a hundred verses, that are senseless and unconnected with the realization of Nibbana, is the recitation of a single verse of the Dhamma, if on hearing it, one is calmed
Compassion and Understanding
It was through the realisation that the Buddha rediscovered the true Dhamma!. That he felt disillusion with this round of rebirth; that he fully understood other beings suffering; that he himself crossed over the flood to Nibbana; that he became his own final and absolute helper. He gained majestic dignity as a worthy Buddha; he remained detached from all beings craving; his own mind was detached from all phenomena....!
For just as the Blessed Ones compassion was without biased sentimental fondness, so was his supreme realization free from the concepts of I Me and Mine... let alone Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, Christiancaste, creed, race an untold misery of mythological Divisions! There is just a single category of Humans...They are Homo sapiens!

State Minister of Defence, Ruwan Wijewardene today rejected allegations made by the opposition that the government was undermining the security forces and said the present government, unlike any other previous government, had done more for the welfare of the security forces personnel.
He said at the function to mark the opening of D S. Senanayake Gama in Hambantota.
We have resolved 70 per cent of the pension issues which the security forces have. Together with the Housing Ministry, we have built houses for them. Therefore how can the opposition say we have undermined the forces, the state minister asked.
He accused the opposition of misleading the people by spreading various kinds of disinformation and underscored the fact that devaluation of the local currency was not only affecting Sri Lanka but several other countries as well. (Yohan Perera reporting from Hambantota)

Sniper rifle going missing is a serious matter: MR
	
If a sniper rifle belonging to the Police Department has gone missing it is a serious matter, former president Mahinda Rajapaksa told the media at his Carlton residence in Tangalle today after participating in a Poya Day programme.
"If such weapons go missing from institutions such as the Police it causes much concern because nobody knows against whom will be used. It is a dangerous situation when one hears the news that the President and the former defense secretary are to be assassinated. Why is no action being taken against the suspects when there is evidence about a plot to assassinate important personalities," Mr. Rajapaksa said.
He voiced concern about the rising value of the US dollar affecting the economy with car prices increasing and imported food items such as lentils and sugar costing more.
Mr. Rajapaksa said during his tenure these items were not imported.
"My government had built up buffer stocks of sugar which were not released to the market. This government lacks management skills. Urgent steps must be taken, by the Central Bank, the Ministry of Finance and other relevant government authorities to curtail the crisis situation," he said and added that the underworld was raising its head not only in the South but within the entire country. People are being killed every day and this government is helpless in stopping this situation.
Mr. Rajapaksa said the provincial council elections were in a quandary because hapazard changes are being introduced to please various political parties.
"Its a funny situation when the subject minister presents the PC elections Bill in Parliament and votes against it. Ranil Wickremesinghe has no clear plan and living in a world of make-believe," he said. (Anisha Manage)

The worlds longest running refugee crisis
	
The 73rd Session of the United Nations (UN) General Assembly opened on September 18, and the general debate which commences on 25 September is scheduled to continue for nine days. 
US President Donald Trump -the leader of the worlds most powerful nation- will be among the host of world leaders and dignitaries attending the UN General Assembly. 
Benjamin Netyanyahu, prime minister of Israel will also, most probably participate, even if only to berate the world body claiming it is biased against Israel... quite forgetting, that it was the UN itself which carved the state of Israel out of what was originally the land of Palestine via UN General Assembly Resolution 273. 
At the other end of the spectrum will be President Mahamud Abbas, leader of the State of Palestine. A state with recognised borders as set out in the Oslo Accord of 1993, but growing smaller as the years pass. These borders have been slowly but steadily, brazenly and openly eroded by the State of Israel. 
And the UN, while on occasion condemning Israeli land-grabbing and other atrocities committed against Palestinian civillians, has largely been ineffective to stop Israeli annexation of Palestinian territory, the eviction of Palestinians from their homes and lands, or halt the atrocities committed against Palestinian civillians -mainly due to the US using its veto to halt the raising of these issues at the UN Security Council. 
According to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) which provides services to around five million Palestinian refugees, mainly descendants of individuals who fled Palestine in the 1948 conflict, after Israeli terrorist organisations unleashed death and terror on Palestinians prior to the creation of the State of Israel. 
In the massacre at Deir Yasin -8 April 1948- around 120 fighters from the Israeli terrorist groups Irgun and Lehi attacked the village, a Palestinian village comprising around 600 people. During the attack, hundreds of Palestinians were killed including women and children. 
According to a count conducted by Jacques de Reynier of the International Red Cross, apart from the bodies left lying on the streets 150 corpses were found in one cistern alone. Among them people who had either been decapitated or disemboweled. 
Israeli historian Benny Morris wrote that there were also cases of mutiliation and rape... 
Today nearly a third of the registered Palestinian refugees -more than 1.5 million persons- live in 58 recognised Palestinian refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon, the Syrian Arab Republic, the Gaza Strip and the West Bank including East Jerusalem During the 1948 Palestine conflict, around 85% (720,000 people) of the Palestinian Arab population of what became Israel fled or were expelled from their homes, to the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, to the countries of Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. 
They and their descendants are assisted by UNRWA in 59 registered camps, 10 of which were established in the aftermath of the Six-Day War in 1967 to cope with new Palestinian refugees. The Palestinian refugees and displaced population have grown to be the second largest in the world. 
It costs the UNWRA around $ 500 million to help the Palestinian refugees. The US contributed US $ 350 million to this fund. Last month however, US President Trump announced that he was stopping with immediate effect the US contribution, because, according to him the Palestinians are not doing enough to take the peace process forward! 
During the past week a delegation from the Palestinian parliament were in Sri Lanka to raise support for their cause at the ongoing General Assembly sessions. The delegation said President Abbas would expose Israeli atrocities, its failure to adhere by the Oslo Accord and US complicity. 
For too long the Palestinian leadership did not bring charges of war crimes, crimes against humanity and charges of genocide against the Israeli state for fear of losing the US contribution to the UNRWA programmes. They also delayed applying for full member status to the UN for the same reason. 
Now, with nothing to lose, President Abbas who has long been holding back on making an application for full UN membership and charging Israel with war crimes before the ICC may feel emboldened to demand full-membership in the UN and press charges against Israel. 
The 73rd Session of the UN could well be the turning point in the Palestinians search for justice; and perhaps, perhaps, lead to sanctions against the criminals responsible for the committing of war crimes.
