Abbott doesnt deny Australia paid people smugglers
	
Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has not denied Australia paid people smugglers to turn around an asylum seeker boat, the Sydney Morning Herald said.
I'm just not going to get into hypotheticals, he has said. 
The Prime Minister had also refused to offer a view about whether such a method would be unacceptable and would not commit to an investigation.
Fairfax Media this week revealed passengers and an Indonesian police chief have claimed border protection officials paid people smugglers to return asylum seekers intercepted north of Australia en route to New Zealand.
Sixty-five people from Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Myanmar, who were seeking asylum in New Zealand, had their boat intercepted by Australian navy and Customs officials in late May the refugees were then returned to the island of Rote.
Indonesia is now investigating claims that crew members of a boat were paid $5000 each to turn around.
Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and Immigration Minister Peter Dutton denied this week that Australia had paid people smugglers.
But Mr. Abbott refused to do the same when speaking on Melbourne radio station 3AW on Friday morning, saying "I just don't want to go into details. The Australian government will do whatever we need to do to keep this evil trade stopped," he said.
Host Neil Mitchell asked whether this would include paying people smugglers. "We will do whatever we need to do to keep this trade stopped," Mr. Abbott replied. He later said the government would do "whatever it takes" so long as it was "consistent with being a humane and decent country".
Asked whether he would support in theory a payment to people smugglers, he said: "I'm just not going to get into hypotheticals."
He said border protection agencies had been "incredibly creative in coming up with a whole range of strategies" to stop people smuggling.
After the interview, Mitchell said the Prime Minister had confirmed by the manner of his answers that Australia had probably paid people smugglers to turn around boats.
The Indonesian police chief on Rote, Hidayat, said the six crew members said they had been given $US5000 each by Australian officials. The crew were apprehended when they arrived at Rote and are being processed for people-smuggling offences.
The Indonesian government has said it is shocked by the claims. Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir said: "If it is true, it's very concerning that a government official gave money to people smugglers to push back the boat to the middle of the sea."

Ananthy Sasitharan in the Eye of a Controversial Publicity Storm Again
	
	By D.B.S. JeyarajBoth here and hence pursue me lasting strife, If once I be a widow, ever I be a wife!..............................
	The lady doth protest too much, methinks
	- William Shakespeare
	:Hamlet Act 3,Scene 2.Politicians are a breed thriving on publicity  negative or positive. Their preference is to bask in the limelight always. They crave attention almost all the time and love to be the cynosure of all eyes.It is said in lighter vein that politicians want to be the bride in a wedding, baby in a baptism and the corpse in a funeral!The most common method used by politicians to generate publicity is to engage in political stunts. Time and again politicians say or do unusual things that capture widespread attention. Once upon a time in Sri Lanka, one parliamentarian came in an Amude to Parliament to protest the rise in prices of textiles. Another MP smuggled in a wreath to the house to signify the death of democracy. Some snatch the mace and run away. Others fling objects around like hand guided missiles. In recent times a group of MPs inclined towards Ex President Mahinda Rajapaksa took over the house by Diyawanna Oya nocturnally - wining, dining and reclining!
	Other stunts include fasting unto death while feasting on lemon puff biscuits, walking in pada yatras, chanting Jana Goshas, riding in bullock carts etc. The easiest of them all is to utter controversial statements, provocative or otherwise. Making such statements do not require much effort or investment. All you need to do is to let off steam or release hot air regardless of consequences. Immediately, there is a blaze of publicity that lasts more than the fifteen minutes of fame allocated by Andy Warhol.
	In the Sri Lanka of today there are many such publicity seeking politicos on either side of the ethnic divide. Most of us are knowledgeable about the usual suspects south of Vavuniya. Many of us however are not so familiar with their counterparts north of Vavuniya. In recent times, Northern Province Chief Minister Mr. Canagasabapathy  Visuwalingam Wigneswaran is perceived as the chief exponent of political stuntmanship in the Tamil political sphere.From the Genocide resolution to lighting the flame at Mullivaaikkaal , the former Supreme court judge indulges in political stunts galore. His chief contender in this exercise as in the race for preference votes- is Northern province councillor Ms. Ananthy Sasitharan. This lady whose initial claim to fame was as spouse of missing senior tiger leader Ezhilan is the focus of this column this week.Sinnathurai SasitharanAs is well known, Ananthy Sasitharan is the wife of Sinnathurai Sasitharan alias  Major Ezhilan who was a senior leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). He had reportedly surrendered - along with a number of fellow tiger leaders  to the armed forces in Mullaitheevu district in May 2009. There is no information about their fate and all of them including Ananthys husband are regarded as missing or disappeared. Ananthy captured national and international attention by a determined campaign demanding information about her husbands situation. This resulted in her receiving lots of sympathy and empathy from the long suffering Tamil people of Sri Lanka.
	The Tamil National Alliance(TNA) cashed in on this by fielding her as a candidate of the Ilankai Thamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK) in the September 2013 Northern provincial elections. She won handsomely with the second highest tally of preference votes in Jaffna.After becoming a provincial councillor, Ananthy Sasitharan chartered an independent course in politics that often fell foul of the TNA hierarchy position. Currently she is suspended from the ITAK on disciplinary grounds. This has not deterred the irrepressible Ananthy who continues with her penchant of being in the news intermittently.
	Ananthy Sasitharans latest phase of controversial publicity is due to two reasons. One is her threat to self immolate in front of the UN building in Geneva if she does not receive justice in the case of her husband Sinnathurai Sasitharan.
	The second is her revelation that her husband had consulted Indian Rajya Sabha (Upper house) MP Ms. Kanimozhi Karunanidhi who allegedly advised him to surrender guaranteeing his safety. Ms. Kanimozhi is the daughter of Muttuvel Karunanidhi the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagham (DMK) chief who was Chief Minister of Indias Tamil Nadu state at that time.While Ananthy wants Karunanidhi and Kanimozhi to explain what had happened then, the chief ministers daughter has flatly denied the charge saying she had never even heard of Ezhilan at that time.
	Whatever the final outcome of this Ananthy  Kanimozhi clash there is little doubt that the current crisis has afforded Ananthy a bright blaze of publicity as usual. Some however speculate that the controversy is a calculated effort to boost Ananthy Sasitharans electoral fortunes at the forthcoming Parliamentary elections. Apparently Ananthy seems to have cultivated a constituency of her own in Jaffna and with the financial aid of the extremist Tamil Diaspora has a very good chance of being elected as an MP. Though engaged in a political flirtation with Gajendrakumar Ponnambalams Tamil National Peoples Front(TNPF) now, Ananthy realises that chances of victory are greater if she could be nominated on the TNA list under the ITAK symbol of the house.
	According to sources close to her, Ananthy hopes to patch up with the ITAK- TNA soon and gain party nomination. She is likely to use the TNPF card as a bargaining chip in these political stakes. Hence, her on going attempt to garner political publicity utilising her missing husband, is aimed at promoting her image with the ultimate goal of securing a parliamentary seat via the TNA-ITAK. While widows of slain politicians seek electoral office in the Sinhala south, Ananthy is doing the same in the Tamil north as the wife of a missing person.Political AmbitionAnanthy Sasitharans political ambition is not a factor that can be dismissed lightly. Even her critics acknowledge that she is a tenacious woman who pursues her objectives with single minded determination. The circumstances of her romance with Ezhilan and marriage to him serve as testimony to her steely resolve. People who are aware of what happened then joke that Ezhilan had no chance whatsoever once Ananthy had set her sights on him.Those events and other matters concerning Ananthy Sasitharan such as her politics, have been related earlier in these columns but are still worthy of being re-visited in the present context.
	It was in the aftermath of the war that Ananthy Sasitharan first grabbed attention  as the wife of Ezhilan. She presented herself before the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) in 2010 when it held sittings in Kilinochchi and testified that her husband had gone missing after May 2009. Ananthy stated that she had personally witnessed his surrender to the armed forces at a point near Vattavaahal in Mullaitheevu district. She was a Govt employee at the Kilinochchi district secretariat at the time she deposed before the LLRC.
	That disclosure made her a sensational figure then. This was the first time after the war that the spouse of a senior LTTE leader had been bold enough to come before a commission and testify that her husband had surrendered and was now reported missing. Speaking to the BBC Tamil service after her testimony Ananthy related her version of what had happened then. Ananthy said that when her husband Ezhilan went with other senior LTTE leaders to surrender, she and the three children had walked behind.
	She said that she saw her husband being identified as Maavilaaru Ezhilan. According to Ananthy an Army officer had asked her to turn back and surrender along with other Tamil civilians as she was a Govt employee and assured her that Ezhilan would be released later.
	Whether true or false Ananthys testimony before the LLRC and her subsequent media interviews did make a powerful impact. LTTE media organs amidst the Tamil Diaspora derived maximum mileage out of it. It later came to light that Ananthy had been encouraged and supported by TNA parliamentarian
	Sivagnanam Shritharan to go public and testify before the LLRC. Nevertheless a wife trying to trace her missing husband was very justifiable and few found fault with her for that. The sight of a single mother with three young daughters seeking the truth about a husband and father aroused much sympathy. Besides there was a romantic touch as the Sasitharan-Ananthy union had been a love story of sorts. Ananthy was born on September 10th 1971 to parents hailing from the Kankesanthurai and Chulipuram areas in Jaffna.
	She was the fifth in a family of six children. Her elder sister Vasanthi who joined the Eelam Peoples Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) had been killed by the LTTE at Kurumbasitty in 1989. Some years later Ananthys younger brother had joined the LTTE. He went missing after a while and is presumed to have been killed in combat.
	Victoria College
	Ananthy was a student at Victoria College in Chulipuram when she first saw Ezhilan who was then in the LTTE. He was from the Atchuvely area in Jaffna. Ezhilan was then active in the political wing of the LTTE. He had come to Victoria College to deliver a lecture to the students. It was customary in LTTE controlled areas then for tiger cadres to address students in their respective schools.
	Ezhilan with his dashing looks made a positive impression on young starry-eyed Ananthy. Also the progressive views he expressed in his lecture on matters such as caste, dowry and womens rights impacted greatly on her.
	It was a case of love at first sight for Ananthy. But that was not so for Ezhilan. When Ananthy conveyed her feelings to him through intermediaries he rejected them immediately. She however persisted and finally met him face to face and proffered her love. Again Ezhilan turned it down saying he was wedded to the ideal of Tamil Eelam and advised her to concentrate on her studies.
	Ananthy was not one who gave up easily. She kept on trying to win Ezhilans heart. In the meantime she completed her secondary schooling and began pursuing studies in accountancy. She gave up studies after getting a Government job. Ananthy started working as a clerk at the Jaffna Kachcheri from June 10th 1992.She worked at the Valigamam west AGA office in Chankanai from 1993 to 1996.
	During these years her passionate ardour for Ezhilan did not diminish. Determined to win her hearts desire Ananthy kept on persevering. Finally Ezhilan melted. But soon there was another problem. The Sri Lankan armed forces regained control of Jaffna through Operation Riviresa in 1995-96. The LTTE including Ezhilan relocated to the Northern mainland of the Wanni. Ananthy too followed soon after. She worked at the Mullaitheevu district secretariat as a clerk from 1997 to 2003. Thereafter she began working at the Kilinochchi district secretariat as a management assistant from 2003 onwards. She continued to retain that job until obtaining a release in 2013 to contest the Northern provincial poll. Ezhilan too began rising up in LTTE ranks as a political wing member. He was a particular favourite of the LTTE political wing chief Suppiah Paramu Thamilselvan. Ezhilan was made political commissar of the Vavuniya district by Thamilselvan with the approval of LTTE supremo Prabhakaran. After the ceasefire came into force in 2002, Ezhilan was transferred to politically sensitive Trincomalee as LTTE political commissar.Maavilaaru Ezhilan
	The Oslo facilitated ceasefire had begun crumbling after 2004. The decisive turning point was in the Trincomalee district when the LTTE blocked the Maavilaaru river in the Moothoor region and prevented water from flowing into Sinhala inhabited areas. This was in July 2006.Ezhilan played a prominent role in justifying this decision and gave many media interviews about the river Maavilaaru and the importance of the blockade. Hence he came to be known as Maavilaaru Ezhilan. The war escalated due to the Maavilaaru episode ultimately resulting in theMullivaaikkaal debacle.
	Ezhilan and Ananthy married on June 6th 1998 at Mulliyavalai in the Mullaitheevu district.LTTE political chief Thamilchelvan presided over the ceremony. Ananthy continued to work in Mullaitheevu and Kilinochchi during the time Ezhilan was stationed in Vavuniya and Trincomalee districts. After being driven away from Trincomalee, Ezhilan and other tiger cadres relocated to the Northern Wanni. Ezhilan began working in the LTTE secretariat in Kilinochchi. Ananthy working at the Kilinochchi Kachcheri stayed together with her husband then.
	
	The Ananthy-Ezhilan couple have three children all of them girls. The eldest Nalvizhi was born on May 23rd 1999.The second Ezhilvizhi was born on 22nd November 2001.The youngest Kayalvizhi was bornon July 15th 2003.
	The family left Kilinochchi when the army advanced and moved to Mullaitheevu district. After the war ended in 2009, Ananthy and the children stayed in an IDP camp for a while and relocated to Kilinochchi where she resumed working as Management assistant in the Samurdhi department at the district secretariat. The children were sent to Chulipuram in Jaffna while the mother shuttled between both places.
	It was while working in Kilinochchi that Ananthy came under the sway of TNA parliamentarian Sivagnanam Shritharan who encouraged her to testify before the LLRC. Apart from the media, the LLRC testimony also attracted the attention of several Non-governmental organizations(NGO) and International NGOs concerned with issues such as disappearances and women rights. Ananthy had much interaction with them. Some NGOs found her useful in helping to mobilise women with disappeared families and utilise them for demonstrations. Initially she went along with these organizations but soon it became apparent that Ananthy had an independent agenda and would not play second fiddle to another. The interaction with these organizations resulted in writs of habeas corpus being filed in courts by Ananthy along with some other women on for their respective family members who had allegedly disappeared.
	Ananthy now began involving herself with NGO activities concerning women and families of disappeared and/or missing persons. She was a fixture at demonstrations often enjoying huge media attention.Window of Opportunity
	A new window of opportunity opened out as elections to the Northern provincial council became a distinct certainty. ITAK general secretary and TNA strongman Somasundaram Senathirajah alias Maavai approached her and asked her to contest on the TNA ticket. She readily agreed. Subsequently Maavai began having second thoughts about his overture as TNA leader Rajavarothayam Sampanthan raised objections.
	Then came Shritharans intervention on her behalf. Strengthened by Shritharans endorsement Senathirajah ignored Sampanthans objections and granted nomination to Ananthy wife of Ezhilan as TNA candidate from Jaffna.
	Ananthy who has been raising the issue of disappeared persons in general and that of her husband in particular used the name of Ezhilan liberally in her electoral campaign. She was not portrayed or projected as a candidate on her individual merits but as Ezhilalin Manaivi Ananthy (Ezhilans wife Ananthy). It was felt that being a mother of three children whose husband had disappeared Ananthy would strike a responsive chord among women. Besides the phenomenon of a wife fighting for the life of her husband or seeking justice on his behalf was sure to evoke sympathetic feelings in the Tamil psyche. Hindu mythology relates the tale of Savithri who locked horns with Yaman the god of death and won a reprieve for her husband Sathiyavaan. The Tamil epic Silappathikaaram narrates the saga of Kannaki(Pathini Deiyyo) who sought justice for her husband Kovalans death from the Pandyan king and in its absence burnt down Madurai city. Ananthy in that context was projected as a latter day combination of Savithri and Kannaki.
	The dawning of polling day on September 21st 2013 saw a bizarre - Ananthy related - election incident occur. A fake Uthayannewspaper with the same format as the original newspaper was printed with the sensational news that Ananthy Sasitharan had deserted the TNA and crossed over to the Government. The fake Udhayan news aroused much interest but dismissed with disbelief and contempt. The Jaffna voter was not to be conned so easily as the forces responsible for the counterfeit edition had naively expected.
	The duplicitous exercise however did churn a wave of sympathy towards Ananthy Sasitharan. Whatever the motives behind the attempt, the cumulative effect was the formation of a massive sympathy wave.The final results saw the TNA sweeping the polls with 30 out of 38 Provincial council seats.Former Supreme court judge and chief ministerial candidate CV Wigneswaran topped the preferences poll with 132,355 votes while Ananthy Sasitharan came second with 87,770 votes.Provincial Councillor
	After being elected as provincial councillor Ananthy Sasitharan has continued to be courageous and consistent in speaking out on the unknown fate of her husband Ezhilan. Since she claims to have personally witnessed the surrender of her husband to army officials on May 18th 2009 at a point near the Vattuvaahal bridge, Ananthys testimony has a ring of authenticity about it. This is why her testimony is received well and most people who hear it cannot help being sympathetic towards her situation.There is also admiration for her boldness in coming forward without fear of consequences. Cynics would say she is using the Ezhilan card for political gain.
	Even as one sympathises with Ananthy Sasitharans predicament one must also think of the numerous victims of the LTTE in the past. It is pertinent in this regard to briefly examine Ezhilans record in this respect.This does not diminish Ananthys personal grief or sorrow in any way but merely depicts the dichotomy of the situation.
	Ezhilan as stated earlier was an active member of the LTTEs political wing. He served as the LTTEs political commissar for the districts of Vavuniya and Trincomalee. It is openly admitted that there has never been a clearly defined demarcation between the military and political wings in the LTTE.
	Ezhilan himself came into global prominence in 2006 when serving in Trincomalee. He played a key role in planning and executing the blocking of water supply via the Maavilaaru river to Sinhala inhabitants in Moothoor division of Trincomalee district.The blocking of water supply is regarded as a crime against humanity. Ezhilan was also responsible for justifying that act publicly.It is indeed a fact that the Maavilaaru blockade was a colossal blunder by the LTTE and afforded the Government the moral high ground with which to prosecute the war intensively. This does not absolve the role of Ezhilan in the matter.His close identification with the exercise earned him the title Maavilaaru Ezhilan.
	After the army succeeded in retaking the east Ezhilan relocated to Kilinochchi where he worked under Thamilselvan in the LTTE political secretariat. As the war escalated the duties of the political wing underwent drastic transformation. The political wing was required to expand recruitment and enhance the number of fighters.The recruitment drive which relied on intensive emotion based propaganda during earlier stages soon deteriorated into forcible recruitment and conscription.Conscription Drive
	The LTTE political wing members were at the forefront in conscripting youths based on the dictum Veetukku oru veeran allathu veeranganai(a hero or heroine from each home). Excessive force and sheer cruelty was shown in this conscription drive.These acts have been publicised by this columnist in earlier articles. After Thamilselvans death in November 2007, Ezhilan was placed in overall charge of recruitment which was in reality conscription. Ezhilan and Thamilini the woman political wing chief acquired a notorious reputation for forcibly recruiting young men,women and children in the years 2008-2009.
	The LTTE escalated its conscription to very high levels after being restricted to the Puthukkudiyiruppu and Karaithuraipattru AGA divisions in Mullaitheevu district. Ezhilan continued to play a terrible role in this along with other senior LTTE political wingers.As the war continued to intensify along the Mullaitheevu coast the trapped civilian population were in a tragic hostage situation. A movement claiming to fight for the liberation of the Tamil people was holding its most vulnerable component in bondage and exposing it to danger and hardship.It was during this time of an unfolding humanitarian catastrophe that this writer appealed repeatedly through these Daily Mirrorcolumns to Let my People Go. These pleas however fell on the deaf ears of the LTTE and what happened thereafter is now history.
	During this tragic phase of war when the Tamils of tiger controlled areas were regarded as the wretched of the Wanni earth that the political wing of the LTTE descended into despicable levels. The LTTE political wing was involved in three terrible tasks even during those perilous times.
	Firstly the political wing continued to forcibly recruit youths and children in huge numbers.They were thrown into war as cannon fodder without adequate training or experience. Secondly the LTTE political wing acted repressively to prevent civilians from trying to escape from tiger controlled areas to army controlled areas for reasons of safety and security. Thirdly the political wing dealt out inhuman punishment to the civilians apprehended while trying to flee. Ezhilan played a significant role in all these.Puthumaathalan
	Among the many cruel acts of Sinnathurai Sasitharan alias Major Ezhilan three horrible acts stand out as illustrations of the depths of depravity one could sink into in a crisis situation.The first is the incident in Puthumaathalan when an ICRC vessel had berthed to transport injured persons for medical treatment. The LTTE as usual prioritised injured cadres,supporters and family members of Tiger members first instead of on the basis of seriousness of injuries.These led to frantic attempts by relatives of injured persons to show their injured family members to ICRC officials and seek priority in being transported by sea for treatment.
	This was resented by the LTTE.Instead of firing guns and alerting ICRC officials the tigers used swords ,knives and poles to hack and assault the civilians and block them from meeting the ICRC. Ezhilan himself brandished a sword and was seen wielding it with much gusto on the helpless civilians.The Maathalan peoples revolt continued even after the ICRC ship departed. Now the LTTE suppressed the protests of the people by firing. At least seven civilians were killed and over fifteen injured in the firing. The tigers opened fire on the orders of Ezhilan it is alleged.Valainjarmadam
	The second incident was at the Catholic Our Lady of the Rosarychurch at Valainjarmadam. Over 900 men,women and children had sought refuge at the church and were looked after by the Catholic priests and nuns who fed them kanjior porridge. The refugees in the church consisted of people without any form of shelter, forcibly recruited cadres fleeing LTTE clutches and families with children facing danger of tiger conscription.
	A tiger triumvirate comprising Ezhilan, Ilamparithi and Malaimahal paid frequent visits to the area and demanded that the Catholic priests turn out the people or allow the LTTE to go into the premises and inspect the refuge seekers.The Catholic clergy stood firm and refused saying the people had sought sanctuary in the church. After repeated endeavours Ezhilan lost patience and set in motion an operation to clear the church.Armed LTTE cadres assembled outside the church as if for a military assault.Ezhilan informed the Catholic priests that members of Tamil groups proscribed by the LTTE were occupying the church and had to be weeded out.
	The LTTE led by Ezhilan then went into the church premises and began dragging out the youths and children in their early teens. When some youths resisted the LTTE opened fire and killed four persons. Over 500 youngsters of both sexes, children and able bodied men were marched out at gun point and compelled to board buses brought by the tigers.They were taken to the battlefront.About 300 older men and women were left behind at Valainjarmadam wailing and sobbing over the loss of their loved ones. Ezhilan was present on the spot from beginning to end supervising and directing the operation.Crucifix Junction
	The third incident was also at Valainjarmadam at a place called Kurusady santhi or Crucifix junction. Ezhilan and former LTTE administrative division head Thangan were leading a team of tigers who had captured a group of civilians trying to flee to Govt controlled areas.Ezhilan was questioning and reprimanding the people as traitors for trying to escape when a young woman with an infant and two small children responded by saying that her children had no milk and that was why she was trying to escape. A heated argument broke out between Ezhilan and the young woman who accused the LTTE of being inhuman and queried Neengal Manisar Illayaa (are you people not human). At this point Ezhilan whipped out his pistol and placing it on the womans forehead fired twice killing her in cold blood.
	These are but three horrible instances where Ezhilan was involved .There are many more which may come to light if and when an intensive,impartial investigation is undertaken and the role and conduct of the LTTE is scrutinised at great length. Even though Ezhilan was involved in such barbaric conduct ,civilised norms stipulate that even persons who commit heinous crimes against humanity at one level are entitled to protection under the law at another level. Even a notorious violator of human rights has basic human rights such as the right to life and can be penalised only after due process of the law.Critical Question
	It is against this backdrop that Ananthy Sasitharan wife of Ezhilan strives to seek justice for her missing husband. The critical question is whether Ezhilan was a victim or perpetrator of human rights violations or both.In that context is Ananthy Sasitharan a voice of the victims or that of the perpetrators
	Ananthy Sasitharan is at the interface of two contradictory positions.As the wife of senior LTTE leader Ezhilan who was reportedly involved in several human rights violations and crimes against humanity, she is at one end of the spectrum. At the same time it is a fact that her husband who surrendered himself to the Army in May 2009 is now missing. In that sense Ezhilan is a victim and so is his wife and family.Thus Ananthys current situation is complicated being the wife of a person who is both a perpetrator of human rights violations as well as a victim.(ENDS)D.B.S.Jeyaraj can be reached at dbsjeyaraj@yahoo.com

Video: CID grills Namal on A'pelassa incident
	
UPFA MP Namal Rajapaksa was today questioned for nearly five hours by the CID on how one of his armed security officers came to be at President Maithripala Sirisenas meeting in Angunukolapelassa.
He was also questioned about Southern Provincial Council Minister D.V. Upul, who in his presence, had threatened to stone to death the police officers attached to the Financial Crime Investigation Division (FCID).
A corporal attached to Mr. Rajapaksas security detail, was arrested by CID detectives earlier and produced before the Agunukolapelassa Magistrate on May 2 for carrying a pistol at a meeting attended by the President at Angunukolapellassa on April 25.
At a May 31 public gathering which was attended by Mr. Rajapaksa and several other politicians representing the Hambantota District, Mr. Upul had threatened to stone to death the FCID officers after former president Mahinda Rajapaksa returns to parliament as prime minister.
I was questioned about the water bottle incident and the remarks made by provincial minister D.V. Upul. I extended my support to the investigations and hope I will be summoned again under yahapalanaya, Mr. Rajapaksa told the media outside the CID office.

Combined forces to fuel MBSLs growth
	
The quarter ending March 31, 2015 signifies Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka & Finance PLCs (MBSL) first quarter as a consolidated and unified entity, following the successful amalgamation with MBSL Savings Bank Ltd (MSB) and MCSL Financial Services Limited (MCSL) in January 2015. With a total post-merger balance sheet size of Rs.27.3 billion, the amalgamation and the resultant conversion to a Licensed Finance Company under the Finance Business Act No. 42 of 2011 has enabled the group to attract relatively low-cost public deposits and diversify its funding sources.
The groups branch network also extended to 49 and the expansion of its human resource consisting of experienced and talented staff has provided ample opportunity for growth, in previously untapped geographical regions and industry sectors.
Performance during the period under review was reflective of groundbreaking operational changes arising during the period of transition, including systems integration, streamlining of processes, impairment requirements and management of human resource issues among others. The groups total income for the quarter was Rs.1.33 billion reflecting the decline in market interest rates although the groups loan portfolio remained relatively unchanged over the corresponding period.
However, a sharper decline in interest expenses by 25.17 percent facilitated the group to maintain a net interest income at Rs.462.24 million. Impairment provisions for the period increased to Rs.244.82 million from Rs.187.39 million the previous year, reflecting the consolidation of MSB and MCSLs loan portfolios, which suffered from relatively high delinquencies. The rise in impairment, together with an escalation of operating costs arising from post-merger transition issues resulted in the group recording a net loss of Rs.153.77 million for the quarter. 
The amalgamation has presented multiple opportunities for the group, both in terms of reach and breadth of services offered as well as achieving diversification and growth in funding avenues. Therefore, the company is well positioned to achieve significant improvements in performance during the remainder of the year. Furthermore, the vision, leadership and industry experience of its new Chairman, a Fellow Member of the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants, Ruwan Gallage and the synergy generated by the new board of directors is expected to propel the group to greater heights through differentiated business solutions.

Discussed proscribed list with GTF: Mangala
	
Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera today confirmed that together with Tamil National Alliance (TNA) MP M.A. Sumanthiran he had met Global Tamil Forum representatives in London and discussed the reviewing of the list of organisations and individuals proscribed in a gazette notification.
He was responding to a statement made by Opposition Leader Nimal Siripala de Silva the previous day and told parliament that the meeting was briefly attended by Eric Solheim the former Norwegian peace envoy to Sri Lanka, a representative of the South African government and representative of the Swiss government.
The minister said the list had been compiled hurriedly and that some of those included in the list had died several years prior to the listing. He said he discussed the release of prisoners held under the Prevention of Terrorism Act in the event charges could not be framed against them.
The minister said the meeting was attended by GTF Strategic Initiative Director Suren Surendiran.
He said the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC), had recomended the constructive engagement with the Sri Lanka diaspora with a view to reconciliation among the communities.
The minister underscored the fact that the LLRC was appointed during the tenure of the previous government but unfortunately such important recommendations were disregarded at that time.
He also emphasised that the Sri Lankan diaspora consisted of some 1.5 millions people belonging to all the main communities and as such it was wrong for anyone to mark it with a single ethnic identity.
The minister said this diaspora, representing Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim and Burgher Communities, consisted of professionals and experts in a wide range of fields and their services should be obtained for the benefit of the country. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)

Gazette notification on 20A to be released today
	
The gazette notification on the 20th Amendment to the Constitution is expected to be released tonight after the special cabinet meeting today finalizes the draft electoral reforms, Cabinet Spokesman, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said yesterday.
Addressing the weekly cabinet news briefing, he said the new Parliament to be formed will comprise of 200 elected members including that from multi seat constituencies and another 25 from the National List and added there will not be a dissolution of Parliament until the 20A was passed in Parliament. .
However, the problem is that many political parties including the minority parties are not in agreement with UNP's proposal to reduce the number of constituencies to 125. We can sort out all these issues and the the composition of the Parliament under the new electoral system when we discuss the Bill at the committee stage,' Minister Senaratne added.
The Minister said the government expected to activate all independent commissions and the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruptions in particular as soon as possible now that the cabinet has given the nod to constitute the Constitutional Council (CC) with already nominated members comprising seven. The other three members that have to be nominated by civil society for the 10 member CC would be nominated after the new government was elected, he said .
Commenting on the No Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake, he said both would not be taken up for debate during the term of this Parliament.
President Maithripala Sirisena has never supported or opposed the two no confidence motions but has told the opposition to choose between the no confidence motions or the 20th Amendment to the Constitution and added that it was unlikely that the no confidence motion against Mr. Karunanayake would be successful as many of the signatories to the motion were ready to withdraw their signatures.
Commenting on the candidates who had applied to contest the general election under the UPFA flag, Minister Senaratne said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had not sent an application but his son Namal had sent one and he would get a nomination. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Video: MR Govt. launched projects without funds - CBK
	
Former president Chandrika Kumaratunge said today the Mahinda Rajapaksa government had initiated development projects illegally without finding funds needed for them and that the present government has had to pay back the loans obtained by them at exorbitant interest rates.
No project can be initiated without crediting funds in the Treasury or finalising documents needed to fund such projects. It is illegal to do so. But the previous government launched such development projects including a drinking water supply scheme at an estimated cost of Rs.560 billion. They were forced to obtain loans at exorbitant interest rates to fund this project when contractors asked for money. Governments usually do not obtain loans at an interest rate of more than 2 percent but the previous government had obtained loans at interest rates of 9 per cent from China and European countries, Ms. Kumaratunge said.
She said the government was renegotiating development projects initiated by the previous government without following the due tender procedure.(Ajith Siriwardana)WATCH

Technology, quality and hyper collaboration top priorities: Deloitte Global CEO
	
Punit Renjen took the helm Monday as the new Chief Executive Officer of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited (Deloitte Global) and defined the global organisations priorities, led by driving a shared sense of purpose across a network operating in more than 150 countries with more than 220,000 people.
All of Deloittes stakeholders  clients, colleagues and the communities in which we work  expect us to make an impact that matters for them, said Renjen. That means we must commit to achieving clear leadership in critical areas through very focused priorities.
Renjen framed a set of strategic priorities, including increasing investment to apply leading technology to serve clients across core businesses of audit, tax, consulting, enterprise risk and financial advisory services. Other top priorities include setting the standard for quality around the world, employing hyper collaboration among the networks member firms to deliver global capabilities tailored to local needs and creating a distinct development experience to attract and inspire talent.
In addition to driving delivery of exceptional core services to clients across a range of industry sectors, Renjen plans to grow the Deloitte networks capabilities in areas such as cognitive technologies, cloud computing, digital and social applications, cyber, risk and crisis services.

Iranian crude oil deal: US rep meets CPC chief
	
	Despite Foreign Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Mahishini Kolonne denying any attempt to unload one million barrels of Iranian crude oil in the Colombo Port, a White House-nominated US State Department envoy met Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) Chairman Ranjith Wickremasingha to discuss this matter, the Daily Mirror learns.
	He told Daily Mirror that he had met a US embassy delegation to explain the alleged attempt at unloading one million barrels of Iranian crude oil worth Rs.7 billion carried to Colombo on Liberian registered oil tanker F WHALE at a time Iran was under a US-led international embargo was in force.
	"I had a fruitful discussion this morning with US Embassy's acting economic counselor Mathew Lowe who has been sent directly from the White House. I was accompanied by Economic Adviser Manohari Dharmadasa. I explained in detail the circumstances surrounding the oil tanker and the CPC's action to strictly adhere to the accepted procedure and the refusal to permit the unloading of fuel at the Colombo Port. They were fully satisfied with the explanation," Mr. Wickramasingha said yesterday.
	Despite a Abu Dhabi broker pressuring the CPC to allow the fuel consignment to be unloaded at the Colombo Port, Power and Energy Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka has clearly instructed the CPC to avoid purchasing fuel outside the accepted procedure," he said.
	Mr. Wickramasingha said the Sapugaskanda oil refinery had stopped using Iranian light crude because 45% of the refined output was furnace oil, but what the CPC wanted was 100% diesel because the need for furnace oil had decreased with a reduced demand for thermal power in the wake of phasing out the purchase of thermal power by the CEB.
	The US embassy in a letter to the Power and Energy Ministry Secretary B.M.S. Batagoda said Sri Lanka was committed to comply with US sanctions on Iran and had given an undertaking that Sri Lanka would not purchase Iranian fuel but there was a concern that at least some of the Iranian fuel might be unloaded in Sri Lanka. The US wanted appropriate action taken by the CPC to prevent any Iranian crude oil being unloaded at the Colombo Port.
	"We are aware that the US embassy in Colombo has drawn informed the CPC of the suspicious movement of the oil tanker F WHALE but we will fully abide with the US sanctions on Iran and therefore the matter of allowing any such fuel being unloaded in the Colombo Port does not arise," Mr. Wickramasingha stressed.
	Meanwhile, Sri Lanka Ports Authority Chairman Lakdasa Fernando said the tanker F WHALE was not allowed to enter the port remained outside.
	"The Liberian-registered oil tanker F WHALE stayed outside the 12 mile radius of the Port. Sri Lankan authorities are not aware of the whereabouts of the tanker right now," Mr. Fernando said.
	The US Charge d Affaires informed the CPC that the Liberian flagged vessel F WHALE was suspected to carry Iranian oil and on the way to Colombo. The vessel had failed to comply with annual safety and other requirement and was no longer registered under the Liberian or Panamanian flag.
	The US embassy alleged that despite instructions, the CPC had reportedly purchased a consignment of Iranian crude oil and some one million barrels were being transported on board this vessel.
	The best example to prove that Sri Lanka fully complied with the US embargo on Iran is a loan of US$25 million still to be settled for a transaction with Iran which took place before the embargo. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
