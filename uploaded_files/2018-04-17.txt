PC Delimitation Report -- Party leaders undecided on date for debate: Mustapha
	
Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faizer Mustapha said the government would never hold elections to the provincial councils under the old system or the much criticized PR system, but was ready to introduce amendments to the Provincial Councils Elections Act of 1988.
Commenting on various media reports that he had agreed with party leaders to hold the PC polls under the old system, the minister said neither he nor the President had agreed to this proposal.
The minister said the government was not ready to hold PC polls under the old system because it was a pledge given by President Maithripala Sirisena at the 2015 presidential polls.
?I met party leaders before the New Year to discuss the holding of elections to the Sabaragamuwa, North-Central and Eastern Provincial Councils. There were suggestions to hold the election under the old system but there was no agreement on it. Although certain minority parties and the JVP did not attend the discussion, those present agreed to introduce amendments to the 1988 Act. The government will hold elections to the three PCs under the mixed First-Past-the-Post and Proportional Voting systems which was introduced to the local government electoral system,? the Minister said.
However, the elections to the three PCs that are under the purview of the respective governors are not possible, as long as the delimitation report tabled in Parliament is not debated.
Although the Delimitation Committee report for elections to the PCs tabled by the minister on February 19, had to be debated and passed within a month after tabling in Parliament, but party leaders had failed to decide on a date for the debate further delaying the elections.
With the enactment of the Provincial Council Elections (Amendment) Act No. 17 of 2017, a new mixed voting system was introduced for provincial councils, where 50 per cent of the representatives would be elected by a simple majority system and another 50% would be selected according to the district level proportional representation method (the additional list).

<U+200B>85 Percent of Businesses Plan to Invest in Digital Transformation in 2018
	
Study shows firms must first master interconnected disciplines of customer experience, operational excellence and business innovation to achieve stronger digital transformation maturity
?
Virtusa Corporation(NASDAQ GS:VRTU), a global provider of digital engineering and IT outsourcing services that accelerate business outcomes for its clients, announced the findings of The Digital Transformation Race Has Begun, a September 2017 study commissioned by Virtusa and conducted by Forrester Consulting, that reflects the digital maturity of firms worldwide. The study evaluates the state of digital transformation across six key industries ? retail, banking, healthcare, insurance, telco, and media.
?
?The Forrester Study confirms that while most companies are preparing to make digital transformation a priority, they have a long way to go before achieving any kind of mastery over the multiple disciplines required to effectively innovate,? said Frank Palermo, global head of digital solutions, Virtusa. ?Firms that are obsessed with their customer?s experience can achieve significant operational efficiencies and put innovation at the heart of their respective cultures and are the ones that will see the greatest benefits from digital transformation. In today?s business climate, with industries being disrupted at every turn, companies must be able to quickly change their products and processes to pivot to take advantage of new market opportunities. As the study finds, improving digital maturity will be key to meeting the changing needs of customers in an evolving marketplace.???
?
The study was generated with input from more than 600 digital transformation decision makers in North America and Western Europe to explore the state of digital maturity across six key industries. Respondents included C-level executives, vice presidents, and directors at companies with revenues ranging from $250 million to more than $1 billion.
?
The study deployed a digital transformation maturity index, examining firms? innovation readiness and competency across these key industries in three areas: customer experience, operational excellence, and business innovation. In all three areas, firms fared slightly better in customer experience compared to operational excellence and business innovation. The study also identified five levels of digital transformation maturity firms can reach ? Curious, Exploring, Deploying, Thriving, and Mastering ? to best synthesize the data from the maturity index. On average, firms currently fall into the lower-to-middle range of the Deploying category (26.06 out of 45).
?
According to the study, currently 85 percent of firms surveyed said they would increase the budget their company allocates for digital transformation next year, with 37 percent indicating the increase would be by 10 percent or more. Further findings from the study include the following:
?
? Retail outperforms other industries across all three categories, setting the standard for creating?
innovative, digitally-driven customer experiences.
? Banking firms are ease-of-use leaders, yet they face investment challenges, including slow economic growth, low interest margins, increased regulation, and changing consumer expectations.
? Healthcare companies traditionally lag behind other industries in adopting business technologies that help with customer engagement. This is tied to intense regulatory requirements leading to a significant focus on security of customer data.
? Insurance organizations are just beginning to digitally transform as the complexity of products and services, legacy technology reliance, and risk-averse cultures all affect how fast insurers can move forward with their digital transformation journeys.
? Telco firms are shifting to customer-centricity, driven in part by low customer satisfaction and disruption caused by over-the-top (OTT) providers.
? Media companies have the most ground to cover in digital transformation. They also represent the group least likely to increase investment in digital transformation.?
?
The study also recommends that firms be customer obsessed by building visions for winning over executive stakeholders, establishing baselines to build digital transformation roadmaps, and putting innovation at the heart of their firms? cultures to ensure greater digital transformation maturity.
?
?In the age of the customer, empowered, demanding customers can exercise more choice than ever before in deciding which companies will earn their business, and which will fall by the wayside. To keep up, firms must invent or reinvent their businesses with technology at the core, or watch customers defect as their markets are disrupted,? the study states, adding, ?To move forward on digital transformation, firms must evaluate their current capabilities, then plot a path forward accordingly. Furthermore, firms must move soon to keep up with the fast pace of digital change ?In the age of the customer, firms must adapt or be swept aside.??
?
Virtusa provides strategic digital solutions and services across a wide spectrum of industries.These solutions are services designed to help companies transform their businesses, expand their addressable markets, and increase revenues. Leveraging its strong innovation and digital engineering expertise, proven platforms, solutions, jump-start kits, and partnerships with some of the leading technology vendors, Virtusa helpsglobal firms in their digital transformation journey.

Survey Methodology
In this study, Forrester conducted an online survey of 606 organizations representing six verticals in North America and Western Europe to evaluate the state of digital transformation readiness today. Survey participants included decision makers in customer insights, digital operations, or business innovation strategy. Questions provided to the participants asked about their current plans and capabilities in digital transformation.

SriLankan to begin restructuring when Director Board approves plans
	
The ailing national carrier, SriLankan will begin its restructuring programme soon after the board of directors approve the plan submitted by consultants Nairas - UK.
The airline's Chairman Ranjith Fernando said yesterday the programme included the securing of a partner or investor, streamlining and re-arranging of routes and cutting down on excess or unproductive staff.
He told Daily Mirror the restructuring programme was approved by the Cabinet and the SriLankan board of directors would approve it before the end of April.
?Our priority would be to re-negotiate the purchase and termination contracts with Airbus Industries and the airline leasing company AerCap based on the renegotiation strategy proposed by Nairas on the basis that the leasing of aircraft by the national carrier has become an unbearable burden to the airline and the country," Mr. Fernando said and added that in addition SriLankan would rearrange its routes and lay off excess staff with a reasonable compensation.
"The new board of directors has already discussed contentious issues that is bleeding the national carrier. Our main concern is to renegotiate the purchasing, leasing and termination agreements in a way that would not be a burden to the country and the airline. SriLankan incurs a loss of some US$100 million or Rs.15 billion) annually which is a huge burden," Mr. Fernando said. ?Our other objective is to bring SriLankan to a break-even point which will be a major relief to the economy, to the airline and to the employees. I expect the board members and the management team would get the maximum possible cooperation and blessings of employees, the government and the people to make our endeavour a success."
Meanwhile, SriLankan airlines has achieved a record annual passenger revenue of Rs.126.9 billion or US$ 830.7 million for the financial year 2017/18 which is the highest ever in the airline?s 38-year history.
The revenue comes on the aftermath of the expansion of the airline to include services to several new destinations such as Gan Islands, Hyderabad and Melbourne and additional frequencies to popular cities in its network.
The airline?s cargo division has also recorded a spectacular performance, achieving a revenue of Rs.14.7 billion. Both passenger and cargo divisions exceeded their annual target, enabling the SriLankan airlines to be bolstered by an even stronger performance at its best performing business unit SriLankan Ground Services ? to comfortably exceed the overall annual revenue target.
The overall Group turnover exceeded one billion US$ making SriLankan one of the handful of companies in Sri Lanka to reach this milestone. It also becomes the highest revenue generating company amongst all Sri Lankan businesses which publicly report their financials.
The re-structuring process including the termination of the lease agreement has been delayed because of differences between the lessee and leaser. SriLankan has recorded a loss of Rs.107 billion within eight years after terminating the management agreement with Emirates.
The new board of directors of SriLankan comprise Ranjith Fernando, a veteran banker and a public servant as Chairman with the other members being Mano Tittawella, Susantha Katugampala, Dr. Roshen Perera, and Air Marshal Kapila Jayampathy. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

## Title: Sunil Shantha: We did not deserve you

Sunil Shantha: We did not deserve you
	
?
The history of the Sinhala song is a history of defeat, sorrow, tragedy, and never-ending shifts of personalities and loyalties. It is a rather sad history, with commentators and critics taking one side to the detriment of another. Those who vouch for the sarala gee, for instance, deride baila, and those who vouch for baila despise the sarala geeya. It?s a crazy paradox at one level ? surely, art forms can?t perpetuate these kinds of clashes, since the only real function of music, cinema, or theatre is to make us respond to them ? but it exists and rather discernibly so in this country. Sometimes some of the arbitrary criteria of values are taken to assess, praise, or flay a composer or vocalist, and unfortunately, even popular audiences affirm these criteria as though they are the only criteria that mattered.??
My (inadequate) encounters with the Sinhala song have informed me that come what may, every art form has a starting point, a guiding star which it takes and then transforms in creative ways. The rift between the spoken and the written variants of a language tend to disappear, because songs are almost always verbal, written and composed to appeal to those who speak, rather than write. The Sinhala song is no different: it evolved out of the way people spoke and shouted, the way they dealt with others when engaged in various professions. As I pointed in my article on Clarence Wijewardena, the 20th century saw a shift from the Anglican elite to the Catholic poor, musically, and this shift, sociological though it is, interests me more on account of the fact that it went hand in hand with our search for a linguistic salakuna that we could claim as our own.??
?
?
If the search for that salakuna went hand in hand with the evolution of Sinhala music, then Sunil Shantha lead the way in bringing together the written word and the melody to end that search. This, of course, we know. What we also know is that for trying to bring about such a fusion, he had to pay the supreme price: a condemned life. Sunil Shantha would have been 103 last Sunday, so I think it?s apt that we reflect on his life and work and ponder on what could have been.??
Sunil Shantha was born Don Joseph John in 1915 in Dehiyagatha, Ja Ela. His parents, staunch Catholics, did not live long enough to see him grow: he was not quite three months when his father died and not quite three years when his mother died. Raised by his maternal grandmother along with some uncles from her side of the family, young Joseph was educated at St Aloysius? College in Galle, where he passed with enough flying colours to become the first in the island. Various teaching stints, having been trained at the Roman Catholic Teacher Training School in Maggona, followed when he began his career at Mount Calvary College in Hapugala. At Mount Calvary, he developed and nurtured a formidable musical culture; it?s a testament to his enduring determination that within the next six years, he was able to lead the school to three consecutive victories at the Southern Schools Music Competition.??
?
?
Those six years ended in 1939, when the War began; that year he passed the Intermediate Level at the prestigious Gandharva Examination. By the time the War ended a further six years later, his life moved quickly, and he had gone to Shanthiniketan and subsequently proceeded to Bhathkande, the two leading Universities teaching music and the arts in the region at the time. Having thus received his Sangeeth Visharada in 1944, he let go of what Professor Carlo Fonseka once wittily referred to as an ?awfully unmusical name?, and so Sunil Shantha was born. He was about 30 at that time, and he returned to Sri Lanka. By then Ananda Samarakoon had initiated a linguistic revolution in the musical sphere in the country. He was not very successful at it, a given considering that it was difficult, especially back then, to get rid of the raghadari sampradaya and forge a musical idiom that could stand on its own two feet and subsist without it.??
?
?
Shantha?s first big hit was ?Olu Pipeela?, first recorded by Radio Ceylon in 1946, the same year that ?Namo Namo Matha? was recorded, the latter sharing the same opening melody. Over the decades ?Olu Pipeela? has acquired the status of a ballad, to be sung and at times performed by everyone, regardless of their proficiency in Sinhala. At parties, at Big Matches, at official functions that end in veritable musical medleys, it has become so endearing that it has become to Sri Lankans what ?Waltzing Matilda? has become to Australians: a tune that has nothing deep buried within, in which the beauty of simplicity becomes its own virtue. Since it?s difficult for me to assess the musical worth of a song (what other kind of worth can there be, one can ask), I can only try and offer a comment.??
In Sunil Shantha?s best work, which came up in the first decade of his career, the vocalist becomes a part of his surroundings he?s in. He doesn?t attempt at turning the banality of those surroundings into something profound. In this sense Shantha was rather akin to the Lake Poets, particularly Wordsworth and Coleridge, who spent their later years celebrating a way of life that was fast disappearing. It?s that kind of pastoral charm which crops up in a tune like ?Mal Mal Mal?, which, incidentally, thematises to a fault what its title suggests:??
?

<U+0DB8><U+0DBD><U+0DCA> <U+0DB8><U+0DBD><U+0DCA> <U+0DB8><U+0DBD><U+0DCA> <U+0DB1><U+0DD2><U+0DBD><U+0DCA> <U+0DB8><U+0DCF><U+0DB1><U+0DD9><U+0DBD><U+0DCA>??

?
There?s an open sense of wonderment that?s almost childlike in the way it expresses itself. To listen to these lyrics today is to understand that Shantha had a limited vocal range (an indictment frequently invoked by his detractors) and that he worked with what he had, the way he could. The textured throatiness and the earthiness of his voice, so different to the high flown, carefully inflected rhetoric of the raghadari-inspired and Sanskritised music in vogue at the time, bringing about what I can only describe as a native voice: it transcends itself evocatively so much because of that quality, and owing to that, it endears itself to us.??
Professor Vinnie Vitharana, in an article written to the Divaina decades ago, argued or rather implied that Sunil Shantha?s search for a musical and linguistic salakuna inadvertently caused him to sacrifice the melody, to pare down rather unnecessarily, in his later years. In a song like ?Po Da Daham Sihile? or ?Ho Ga Ralla Binde?, you infer the looping bars, the return to a basic melody, the carefully structured rhythms and cadences that are almost cautious of reaching out. What got lost in these experimental pieces, Professor Vitharana further implied, was a sense of openness, the sort of openness that demarcated his earlier work. It?s pertinent to observe here that the loss of richness in these songs coincided with a career phase that would, tragically and unnecessarily, see him evicted from Radio Ceylon over his crusade for the deshiya sangeethaya. He was paring down because he was, I think, making a statement: a bold one at that.??
?
?
What got him finally evicted from Radio Ceylon was, of course, the Ratanjankar episode, which has been written on so many times by so many writers, in Sinhala and English, that even a brief recounting thereof is unnecessary. Perhaps Rohana Baddage, whom I met months ago, put it best: ?It was nothing more or less than a clash of ideology and politics on the personal and the musical plane.? Yes, it was exactly that, a clash, and considering that both sides had their firebrands, champions, and detractors, it was one from which those who stuck to their word, with no compromises, could only be evicted. Eventually, that?s what happened.? ?
Shantha?s return to the world of Sinhala music came about through an art form that he despised: the movies. Rekhava, of course, has compelled enough and more footnotes from critics with respect to how Lester James Peries, along with Shantha?s Hela Havula contemporary, Father Marcelline Jayakody, goaded him into coming back to score Lester?s debut film. Audiences reacted favourably to the music, regardless of their ambivalent reactions to the film as a whole, because in no Sinhala movie before it had the music been so indefinable, so outside the constraints of the Sanskritised idiom. Sasanka Nanayakkara, writer, raconteur, and observer of all things artistic, once put to me that when you hum ?Olu Nelum Neriya Rangala? or ?Vesak Kekulu? or ?Sudu Sanda Eliye?, you are entranced by the sense of wonderment in them. You can?t rationalise or define that feeling; you can only revel in it, just as you revel in ?Waltzing Matilda.???
And at the end of the day, isn?t that what a song is supposed to do???

## Title: TUK TUK INDUSTRY HITS-A-SNAG

TUK TUK INDUSTRY HITS-A-SNAG
	
The National Council for Road Safety announced last week that fare metres for trishaws (tuk tuks) will be mandatory and the law would be strictly enforced after April 30. Accordingly trishaw drivers will now be required to provide the customer with a printed bill, indicating the fare and details of the journey.
Interestingly, officials said however that they would not intervene in the manufacturing of taxi metres, but noted that metres must be manufactured keeping with the standards and specifications stipulated by the Ministry of Transport.
Not all three-wheel drivers were in agreement with these mandatory laws. President of the Lanka Self Employed Professionals National Three-Wheel Federation, Sunil Jayawardana said his association strongly opposes the new regulations due to several reasons. ?The National Council for Road Safety (NCRS) previously made a similar statement, following which we held discussions with the Chairman of the Road Passenger Transport Authority. We made our concerns very clear. There is no standardised metre available in the market. When the metre unit is not provided by the Government, they have no right to demand that we install a metre. We are in possession of evidence that this is the result of a deal made among several trishaw associations, metre vendors and NCRS officials,? Jayawardana charged.?
According to Jayawardana several parties with vested interests are attempting to sell 100,000 units of taxi metres with the new regulations in place. ?An officer is making a profit of Rs. 10 from each unit sold and we have evidence to support our statements. We are not interested in making individuals or companies profit and therefore we demand that the Government introduces an affordable and standardised metre,? he alleged.?
?On several occasions, we have requested meetings with the President, but our concerns have been ignored by the authorities. Therefore we have resorted to operating tuk tuks without the metre and with increased fares,? said Jayawardana speaking of the federation?s attempts to discuss its issues. These concerns include the high cost of spare parts, sale and distribution of counterfeit spare parts as well as the overall lack of regulation of the three wheelers operating island-wide.?
?For 39 years, no Sri Lankan Government has introduced stringent measures to regulate an industry comprising 800,000 trishaw drivers. We have continuously requested for a regulatory authority and yet they have merely been promises made during Budget speeches,? Jayawardana said.??
?Metres are installed at costs varying from Rs. 8,500 to 18,500. These are sold with a considerable margin and huge profits for companies selling them,? he charged.?
Jayawardana is of the opinion that if regulation is to take place, the metre fares must change according to the area where the driver operates. ?The metres must be issued and licensed by the Department of Measurement Units, Standards and Services, in order to bring fares under state control,? he said.?
Jayawardana however holds a different view regarding mobile app based taxi services, a view that apparently pays no regard to safety or convenience of the passenger. ?The government has allowed local and international companies to operate in Sri Lanka to discourage trishaw drivers. Under the Megapolis plan, the Government has opted to do away with trishaws in the city. Authorities are simply trying to dispose of trishaws,? Jayawardana alleged.
?In services such as ?Pick Me? the waiting charge is double the amount a regular driver charges. Passengers are tricked into thinking that their services are economical when it is not. Beyond Colombo however, the Government would find it extremely difficult to discourage the operation of trishaws,? he said.?
The Southern Province Road Passenger? Transport Authority says? that following the gazette notification almost? 1,300 trishaws have been registered with them.

?Meanwhile there are moves to introduce a new vehicle called the quadricycle to replace the tuk tuk. This vehicle has not even been approved for passenger transport in India, where it is manufactured. Yet, it is set to be launched in Sri Lanka soon, with the support of authorities who are involved in this massive scam. We have carried out a campaign of petitions against this move,? Jayawardana said.?
On April 10, several civil society groups including Jayawardana?s group, handed over a petition to the Indian High Commission against the attempt to import the Indian manufactured quadricycle.?
Quadricycles are four-wheeled micro-cars with relative restrictions in weight, power and speed. The four-seater vehicle manufactured by Pune-based Bajaj Auto, named the ?Qute? is exclusively manufactured for export markets at present. Its launch has been stalled in India due to the vehicle?s safety features being challenged in Supreme Court, despite the Indian Government?s go-ahead to introduce quadricyles as a new vehicle category.
The European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP), a Belgium-based automobile crash test agency, gave a single-star safety rating to the Bajaj Qute quadricycle. One of the main reasons for the Qute?s poor performance in tests was due to the absence of basic safety features such as driver or passenger airbags. In a letter to Bajaj Auto, Euro NCAP stressed that the Qute does not perform well in terms of safety and has misled consumers.?
Even without the safety options offered by similar micro cars, President of the All Island Three Wheeler Drivers? Union, (AITWDU) Lalith Dharmasekara believes that the import of quadricycles to Sri Lanka would provide a better option for passengers. ?If I am able to purchase a quadricycle, I would, simply because it offers the safety a trishaw cannot,? Dharmasekara opined.? ?Even if there are moves to introduce the quadricycle, it should not be a cause for worry,? he added.?
Dharmasekara believes that stressing over the impending imports of quadricycles is futile as it shifts the focus away from the real issue. ?The industry has not been regulated for over 30 years,? Dharmasekara said. ?The disorganised nature of our profession is in fact the issue which needs to be addressed promptly and it is one that we have been demanding for a long time,? he said adding that members of the AITWDU had not been a part of any trade union action.?
??The metre fares were introduced through a properly calculated formula in 2005. With the rise in the cost of living, we obviously have countless reasons to raise the fare and many drivers have even done so.? But resorting to trade union action of operating without a metre is an ignorant and unwise decision. Their arguments are presented with no understanding of the situation,? he said.?
?There are Nano taxi services which provide the passenger more comfort and safety for just Rs. 40 per kilometre. I simply can?t imagine that the passenger would prefer to board an expensive trishaw operating without the metre, when they have the option of using a much cheaper taxi which is not only reliable, but also secure and can be hailed at their convenience. Therefore we cannot agree with their actions,? Dharmasekara said referring to the trade union action taken by the Self Employed Professionals? National Three-wheel Federation.
However the AITWDU has been demanding for a regulatory authority for many years following the rapid degradation of three-wheeler services across the island. ?This Government made many promises before it assumed power. Budget speeches were made by two ministers, but we are still waiting for them to deliver,? Dharmasekara lamented.?
?What we understand is that the officials too are rendered helpless. We have been informed that in order to establish a regulatory authority, many departments have to be consulted. The Attorney General?s Department, provincial councils and even the Tourist Board is involved in consultations. The process has been botched and delayed for years. This is the result of grave and widespread inefficiency among a host of Government authorities,? Dharmasekara pointed.??
The four-seater vehicle manufactured by Pune-based Bajaj Auto, named the? ?Qute? is exclusively manufactured for export markets at present.
?
Several attempts to contact the subject Ministers and the Secretary to the Ministry of Transport proved futile. However Senior Assistant Secretary K. G. Dharmathilaka, informed the Daily Mirror that the duties of the Ministry are limited to the formulation of policies.?
?This is a decentralised subject. We have no authority or capacity to regulate trishaw operations. This subject of regulation comes under the purview of the provincial authorities,? Dharmathilaka said. Asked if there were any discussions held on the subject at Ministry level, Dharmathilake said the Ministry is involved in the making of policies and drafted the technicalities which have been included in the gazette and no further deliberations are being made at present.?
The Daily Mirror spoke to several provincial authorities regarding the subject. The Western Province Road Passenger Transport Authority Chairman Thusitha Kularathna said the authority is still drafting a mechanism to regulate trishaws in the Western Province. Asked when the proposed regulations would come into effect, Kularathna said he is unable to give a time frame for such work.?
?Our proposals and plans have been submitted to the Legal Department. We have requested the officials to deliberate the matter at the earliest, so that we can promptly implement a system to regulate trishaws,? said Kularathna. According to Kularathna the new system, once implemented, would make the profession accountable and thereby address several areas of concern.?
Operations and Planning Officer of the Southern Province Road Passenger Transport Authority said that following the gazette notification, almost 1,300 trishaws have been registered with them. ?Through registration we are attempting to secure their services and control the excess of vehicles in three-wheeler stands. This would also discourage malpractices among trishaw drivers,? the officer said.
?However the registration process has been stalled for some time now. We have encountered an obstacle as we have no legal authority in certain areas in which we have to deal with the Police. To rectify this situation we need the intervention of the Motor Traffic Ordinance, as the provincial councils have no legislative powers. Since there is no solution to this obstacle, the registration of three wheelers has been slow,? the officer said.
Meanwhile an official of the Central Provincial Council Transport Department said that although decisions were made to regulate trishaws in the Central Province, it has not been implemented thus far. ?There are various issues which have been voiced by three wheel drivers? associations across the province. These issues are being addressed by the respective divisional councils,? the officer said.??
Pointing out to the persistent issue in regulation the officer said it is a difficult task to educate the three-wheel driver community due to several factors.? ?Thus far we have engaged in various awareness and education campaigns to elevate the three-wheel drivers in the province to a professional level. Unlike with other areas of transport, it is extremely difficult to educate or provide training in this sector. The main reason for this is the age groups involved. There are three-wheel drivers ranging from 18 to 70 years of age within this group, which makes their training all the more difficult,? he explained.?
Sri Lanka?s three wheeler population has been on the rise. As the numbers indicate, Sri Lankans have chosen the tuk tuk as their preferred mode of transport. Regardless of whether this is a positive or negative development, lawmakers must ensure that the much needed regulations tabled in 2016 and gazetted in 2017 is enforced at least in 2018.?
With a total tuk tuk population of 1,062,447 registered in 2016, it is time that a comprehensive policy to curb over-population is introduced. Let?s not forget that while the tuk tuk provides for a relatively affordable and comfortable mode of transport in the absence of satisfactory public transport, the vehicle is also the poor man?s trusted mode of transport in emergencies. Like it or not, the trishaw has become an integral part of the Sri Lankan transport system and hence its regulation must not be haphazard and ad-hoc, but meaningful and positive.

Wiggy plans new political front against TNA
	
Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran is hoping to form a new political party as an alternative to the Ilankai Tamil Arachu Kachchi (ITAK) to contest the upcoming provincial council elections, a source close to him said yesterday.
He contested the 2013 elections under the banner of the ITAK-led Tamil National Alliance (TNA) though however, he fell out with the ITAK leaders later.
The source said the chief minister would form a new party move for a broad political alliance as an alternative to the TNA to contest the elections.
The TNA leaders are on record saying the TNA would not nominate Mr. Wigneswaran.
When asked about the latest political development, Eelam People?s Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) Leader Suresh Premachandran said the chief minister had expressed his interest in forming a united political front as he was not pleased with TNA policies.
When asked whether the EPRLF would join hands with him, he said, it would depend on how the Chief Minister played his cards. (Kelum Bandara)

## Title: Canadian police identifies SL man as victim of serial killer

Canadian police identifies SL man as victim of serial killer
	
Canadian police have identified the remains of a Sri Lankan man they believe is a possible victim of suspected serial killer Bruce McArthur.
Mr McArthur, 66, was charged on Monday with an eighth count of first degree murder in the death of Kirushna Kumar Kanagaratnam, 37.
Police believe Kanagaratnam was killed sometime between 3 September and 14 December 2015.
He arrived in Canada in 2010 and lived in the Toronto area.
In March, police released the photograph of an unidentified deceased man as part of the investigation into the accused killer in the hopes a member of the public could help in his identification.
Police said they received hundreds of tips, and announced late last week they had made a successful identification.
Toronto police detective Hank Idsinga said on Monday that Kanagaratnam's direct family, who live in Sri Lanka, were informed over the weekend of his death.
The detective did not reveal Kanagaratnam's immigration status and said he had never been reported missing in Canada.
His remains were identified as one of at least seven dismembered bodies found in plant pots on a midtown Toronto property linked to Mr McArthur.
So far, all of the eight suspected victims except Kanagaratnam had ties to the city's Gay Village.
All went missing between 2010-17.
Many were immigrants from South Asia or the Middle East.
Members of Toronto's LGBT community have criticised police, saying they did not take their concerns about the missing men seriously.
The first two alleged victims were identified in January as Andrew Kinsman, 49, and Selim Esen, 44, who both went missing in 2017.
Since then, police have named Skandaraj Navaratnam, 40, who disappeared on Labour Day weekend in 2010; Soroush Mahmudi, 50, reported missing in 2015; Dean Lisowick, 47, who is believed to have been killed in April 2016; Abdulbasir Faizi, 42, who disappeared in 2010; and Majeed Kayhan, 58, who disappeared in 2012.
The remains of all but Kayhan have been identified.
Mr McArthur has yet to enter a plea in any of the charges.
Police arrested Mr McArthur on 18 January. He had been under surveillance, but police have yet to reveal the exact evidence and circumstances that lead to his arrest.
The news came weeks after police tried to calm community concerns - following a handful of disappearances in the village over a number of years - that there was a serial killer stalking the neighbourhood.
A massive investigation that spans Canada's largest city has since been launched, and police are looking at missing persons cases dating back decades.
Investigators are also reviewing 15 homicide cold cases from 1975 to 1997 as part of the inquiry into the suspected killer.
In May, investigators will begin searching up to 75 Toronto properties linked to the self-employed landscaper.
Police are also working with law enforcement agencies in other jurisdictions, and are in contact with international agencies as part of the investigation. (BBC)

Certification and training to be introduced for scaffolding
	
The practice of erecting scaffolding for construction purpose dates back to centuries ago when mighty palaces and temples were built. However, the methods and techniques have scarcely developed in Sri Lanka over the years, as it is observed that timber and, in most instances, bamboo is still used, even during the construction of high rise buildings.?
According to the Chairman of the Vocational Training Authority of Sri Lanka, Eng. Dr. Lionel Pinto, over 50 scaffolding related deaths were recorded over the past 2 years. ?This is mainly due to the unscientific and unprofessional construction and use of scaffoldings. With the rapidly growing construction industry in Sri Lanka which widely includes high-rise buildings, scaffolding becomes the most required mechanism that is and will be used,? he said. Dr. Pinto made this observation at the event held to celebrate the signing of an MoU between the Vocational Training Authority (VTA) of Sri Lanka and Smart Trends International Lanka. The Memorandum of Understanding brings Smart Trends International Lanka into a strategic partnership with the VTA to offer the UK awarding body, NCFE?s globally recognized certified courses. The first initiative will be to develop and design a scaffolding training course.
Presenting to the guests on the project, Maheswaren Balakrishnan, COO of Smart Trends International Lanka highlighted the fact that most accidents and deaths occur due to various levels or no quality standards being applied in terms of technology, skills and construction. The consequences of poor standards in scaffolding are detrimental to the worker ? fatality, permanent or temporary injury and inability to work - and the business ? lawsuits, compensations and image of the brand among other factors. He emphasized that the cost of poor quality can rise up to 200% as many losses are not tangible.?
The programme which will be introduced through the strategic partnership will raise, improve and standardize the scaffolding standards of the industry in Sri Lanka by making available an international qualification and standard certified by NCFE (UK). A national awarding organization, NCFE qualifications contribute to the success of millions of learners at all levels. It will up-scale and up-skill the local workforce to the next level of quality standards thereby ensuring better prospects in terms of employability both locally and internationally. The construction industry will be benefited by the ability to deliver high quality service and gain opportunities to participate in large scale projects with confidence. In the long term, the entire eco system including the workforce, contractors, insurers, suppliers, standard organizations, financial organizations and project owners will harness the advantage of the higher standards of quality and safety.?
The course will span 4 levels, and the complete investment on infrastructure and resources will be borne by Smart Trends International Lanka. Level 1 is the Certificate in Business Scaffolding where workers will be trained to operate to the new Standards for Sri Lanka for Scaffolding including; identifying the correct scaffolding for the task, erecting and dismantling scaffolding and all related health and safety requirements. The next level, Certificate in High Rise Scaffolding will endow the additional skills required to erect and dismantle high rise scaffolding including all the additional health and safety requirements for working at height. Level 3 of the course ? Certificate in Scaffolding Supervisor - is for a Supervisory level which gives them the skills to supervise, train and assess to the new National Scaffolding Standards for Sri Lanka. Those who qualify and complete the final level which is the Advanced Certificate in Scaffolding for Sri Lanka will be recognized as scaffolding inspectors ensuring that construction sites comply in all aspects to the new National Standards for Scaffolding in Sri Lanka.

Challenges in ridding India of the scourge of rape
	
?
India is being rocked by country-wide public protests over the rape of three females. Two of them, just 8 and 11 years of age, were also murdered in the most gruesome manner.? ?
While these gory deeds could be treated as a law and order problem, the phenomenon of rape and violence against women needs to be addressed in a holistic way as it is both widespread and multi-dimensional with social, economic, historical and political aspects.? ?
The public anger is directed against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi because the States in which these gruesome acts occurred have the BJP either as the sole ruling party or as a key partner in government.? ?
The 17-year-old was raped in Unnao, Uttar Pradesh, where the BJP is all in all. The 8-year-old Asifa was raped and murdered in Kathua in Jammu and Kashmir, where the BJP is a key partner in a coalition government. The 11-year-old was raped and murdered in Gujarat where the BJP has a monopoly of power.? ?
While rape and cum murder is not uncommon in the still feudal India, what outraged the public was the State?s stoic silence and the partisan nature of the deeds of the governments and their political supporters.? ?
The Incidents
A 17-year-old girl was raped by a BJP State legislator, Kuldeep Sengar in Unnao in Utta Pradesh in mid-2017. In a lone fight against police indifference, the girl tried to commit suicide outside the residence of State Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. Her father was then beaten to death by the legislator?s brother and BJP cadres in the presence of the police.? ?
After an uproar in civil society, Sengar?s brother was arrested and continued protests led to his arrest by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). But this took place only in April 2018.? ?
In January 2018, a Muslim tribal child of 8 was abducted, raped, and murdered by a former government officer and a serving police officer with an intention to terrorize the nomadic Muslim Bakherwal community to vacate Kathua en masse.? ?
Two ministers of the BJP in the Jammu and Kashmir government along with the Kathua BJP legislator, led a procession supporting the rapists. They made provocative speeches inciting violence against the nomads.? ?
?
What outraged the public was the State?s stoic silence and the partisan nature of the deeds of the governments
Lawyers, many of them known to the ruling party members, blocked the court to prevent the police from filing the charge sheet
Even the UN, which usually turns a blind eye to atrocities in India, was stirred into action
Lawyers, many of them known to the ruling party members, blocked the court to prevent the police from filing the charge sheet against the rape accused saying that the police had a pro-Muslim mentality because Jammu and Kashmir is a Muslim-majority State. But the truth was that the chief investigating officer who cracked the case, was a Hindu, Ramesh Kumar Jalla.? ?
The third incident came to light on Sunday when the raped and murdered body of a 11-year-old was found in a forest in Surat in Modi?s home State of Gujarat. The girl had been killed on April 5 even as anti-rape protests were on country-wide. Investigations into this have just begun.? ?
When the Prime Minister Modi spoke, after an excruciatingly long period of silence, he did so casually at a function, and tweeted his comment. No executive or political action was announced or taken, though he dubbed the rape and murder as ?shameful?. Clearly, he had placed his partisan interest before the national interest.? ?
Deepa Narayan, author of a book on violence against women in India told The New York Times: ?Modi is always a slow reactor. He waits for an issue to go away and when it doesn?t, and he?s in a corner, he speaks up and makes platitudes. I think the B.J.P. will suffer from this. They will pay a price for the impunity they?ve unleashed by not treating crimes as crimes but by politicizing them.?? ?
Anguish of Ex-Civil Service Honchos? ?
Reacting to the government?s callous indifference, 49 retired top officials, sent an open letter to Modi which said: ? The bestiality and the barbarity involved in the rape and murder of an eight year old child shows the depths of depravity that we have sunk to. In post-Independence India, this is our darkest hour. We see no light at the end of the tunnel and we hang our heads in shame.?? ?
?Prime Minister, we write to you not just to express our rage over the agenda of division and hate your party and its innumerable, often untraceable offshoots that spring up from time to time, have insidiously introduced into the grammar of our politics, our social and cultural life and even our daily discourse.?? ?
?It is that which provides the social sanction and legitimacy for the incidents in Kathua and Unnao.?? ?
?In Kathua in Jammu, it is the culture of majoritarian belligerence and aggression promoted by the Sangh Parivar which emboldened rabid communal elements to pursue their perverse agenda.?? ?
? They knew that their behavior would be endorsed by the politically powerful and those who have made their careers by polarizing Hindus and Muslims across a sectarian divide.?? ?
?In Unnao in Utar Pradesh it is the reliance on the worst kinds of patriarchal feudal mafia dons to capture votes and political power that gives such persons the freedom to rape and murder and extort as a way of asserting their own personal power.?? ?
?But even more reprehensible than such abuse of power, it is the response of the State Government in hounding the victim of rape and her family instead of the alleged perpetrator that shows how perverted governance practices have become.?
?Given your supremacy within the party and the centralized control you and your Party President exercise, you more than anyone else, have to be held responsible for this terrifying state of affairs.?? ?
?You have not condemned the communal pathology behind the act nor shown the resolve to change the social, political and administrative conditions under which such communal hate is bred.???
UN awakens?
Even the UN, which usually turns a blind eye to atrocities in India, was stirred into action.? ?
?We are deeply concerned about the prevalence of gender-based violence, including sexual violence against women and girls, which we are witnessing in India,? said Yuri Afanasiev, UN?s Resident Representative in India in a statement.? ?
? The cases reported are not isolated ones. There are many others which remain invisible, unheard and therefore, not counted due to everyday normalization of sexual and other forms of violence.?? ?
?An unequivocal commitment by the leadership at the highest level to address sexual violence and to ensure accountability for such crimes is essential for justice to be delivered,? Afanasiev said.? ?
Grisly Statistics?
According to the 2016 figures put out by the Indian National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), incidents of rape of children had increased by over 82% compared to 2015. It was for the first time that such a sharp increase in sexual assaults on children had been registered.? ?
The NCRB data shows that while in 2015, 10,854 cases of rape were registered, 2016 saw 19,765 such cases being registered.? ?
The numbers reported were the highest in Madhya Pradesh (2467), Maharashtra (2292), and Uttar Pradesh (2115), all States ruled by the BJP.? ?

H?tota Port--No need to speculate from military perspectives: China
	
The Chinese Government on Monday assured that there was no need for certain people to make speculations from the military or other strategic perspectives about the Hambantota Port in Sri Lanka.
Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying's expressed these views at the Regular Press Conference when asked whether Hambantota port would be used as a military base in the future.
Ms. Hua said the port is a cooperation project conducted by China and Sri Lanka on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.
?It will contribute to local socio-economic development. Our two sides have the strong will to ensure the smooth progress of this project. I think that there is no need for certain people to make speculations from the military or other strategic perspectives,? she said.
Meanwhile, responding to reports that there are accusations against the financing projects in the framework of China's Belt and Road Initiative, she said the initiative was open and transparent.
?As to the different views held by some people, I think that the conclusion may be different when people view the same thing with a different mindset and from a different perspective. We hope that relevant countries can follow the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits to advance it and deliver benefits to their people,? she said.

Imported goods to go up in price: Bandula
	
Prices of some imported goods including petroleum products, fertilizer, gas and chemicals would rise further because of the depreciation of the rupee, MP Bandula Gunawardana said today.
He told a news conference that the government's mismanagement of the economy had resulted in plunging the country's into the doldrums.
?Prices of imported goods are linked to World Market prices. As the value of the Sri Lankan rupee has depreciated to Rs.158 against the US dollar, the prices of certain goods including essential items like rice, flour, sugar, dhal and dried fish will increase,? the MP said.
He said it was difficult for the government to overcome the prevailing economic instability due to the current political crisis, and as such the government should immediately go for a parliamentary election and hand over the country to a party capable of governing the country effeciently.
Meanwhile, he said the joint opposition would support the proposal of the the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) to abolish the executive presidency, only if Parliament would be dissolved on the day this proposal is passed. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
