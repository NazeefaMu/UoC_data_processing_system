Arrest them all: Harsha
	
Welcoming the arrest of Perpetual Treasuries Chief Arjun Aloysius and others, Deputy Minister of Development Policies and Economic Affairs Dr Harsha De Silva today said the Attorney General should go ahead and immediately arrest those named in the 34 reports of Presidential Commission looking into serious crimes (PRECIFAC) as well.
Also, Dr De Silva said the arrest was welcomed but he wished that it happened earlier, when the AG?s Department was first informed by the Prime Minister in 2016.
?Glad it has happened. All those who robbed the public must pay upon conviction. This is the change people voted for in January 2015. However, I wish it happened earlier when the AG?s Department was first informed by the Prime Minister in 2016. If so, crooks would already have been in jail,? he said.
The Deputy Minister said it was he who first revealed in Parliament in 2011 as to how the ring was engaging in massive securities fraud in the equity market.
?It was I who first revealed, starting in 2011, in and outside Parliament how a rogue ring was engaging in massive securities fraud in the equity market. But the regime along with the then CBSL Governor instead of investigating them went ahead and issued them an additional license to trade in the debt market,? he said.
?I hope the authorities would at least now support the Central Bank and the Securities and Exchange Commission by providing necessary technical support for forensic investigations to reveal the totality of the fraud that took place since then in both in the equity market and in the debt market.
?I hope that the AG will go ahead and immediately arrest those named in the 34 PRECIFAC reports as well. The future of our nation depends on it,? he said. (Yohan Perera)

Controversial ?laptop dance? removed
	
Authorities have scrapped the contorversial ?laptop dance? by school girls during the main Independence Day parade in Colombo today, after the unconventional item attracted ridicule on social media, economynext reported
Unlike the erotic art of lap dance, the 21st century Sri Lankan version was performed by students dressed in black leggings, yellow skirts and black short-sleeved jackets to symbolize the computers given by the education department.
They were to rhythmically punch the air with notebook computer replicas made of wood and painted black and yellow to match their highly modest costumes.
The troupe was seen rehearsing on Saturday without the ?laptops? and their teacher said they had orders to drop the props, but keep only the dance routine.

Corruption culture must end: President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena said the fight against corruption was the self-defence of the country?s march towards prosperity and the country must be fully prepared and dedicated to put an end to corruption, theft and waste once and for all.?
He added that each and every politician in Sri Lanka had a responsibility to carry out his or her service to society in an exemplary manner sans mischief, corruption and theft, because it was the duty of the hour of all politicians.
?In his address to the nation at the 70th Independence Day celebrations held at the Galle Face Green today, President Sirisena went onto say that a broad national movement against corruption was essential as a safeguard to achieve Sri Lanka?s objectives of economic development and social, cultural and spiritual happiness.?
?Bribery, corruption, fraud, mismanagement and malpractices were the most adverse impact on economic independence of the country, hence all the politicians should fulfill their duties in an exemplary manner,? President Sirisena stressed.?
Emphasizing the importance of identifying development priorities, President Sirisena pointed out that there were adverse repercussions due to implementation of personal agendas in development strategies.
??Therefore, the need of the hour is to maintain financial discipline. Politicians as well as Public Servants including every Head of Departments fulfilling the responsibilities towards the people must act with utmost fiscal discipline,? he said.
??There was a requirement of a national movement against corruption in order to establish a clean political culture and such a collective movement must be mobilized with the participation of the collective of intellectuals and professionals of the country,? he said.
??There is no doubt that the desire of each and every Sri Lankan is to achieve a speedier progress in every aspect of life. Far-reaching reforms in the Public Sector are required to realise that objective with the assistance and cooperation of the Private Sector.
??The true development cannot be restricted to economic progress alone. Achieving a true national development means the growth and advancement in living, social and cultural standards while maintaining a healthy balance in enjoying the environment resources and at the same time protecting it,? he said.?
President Sirisena said that the experiences gained during the past 70 years must be used to face the future challenges.?
?One of the main challenges is poverty and successive Governments in the past implemented different programmes to free the people from poverty and they have made positive contributions.?
?With those experiences, we have launched programmes to achieve that end and there is a need to make them more intelligent and efficient and I am sure with such measures we can win this challenge,? he said.?
The President paid his tribute to the members of security forces who made immense sacrifices to defeat terror unleashed by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
??When the LTTE attempted to break our country, our Army, Navy, Air Force, Police and Civil Defence Services sacrificed their lives and limbs and many became handicapped, even denied their children and families a proper family life, suffering many painful experiences on behalf of future of the nation, freedom of the nation and the territorial integrity,? he said.?
President Sirisena pointed out the need for communal harmony among the Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim and Burgher communities to build the nation and stressed the need to protect the rights of the people to live as equal citizens. He said fullest commitment and support of every section was essential to achieve true reconciliation.
?President Sirisena noted the importance of reshaping of administrative, legislative and executive bodies such as Local Government bodies, Parliament and the office of Executive Presidency in order to provide the opportunity for the people to get maximum possible benefit from those establishments. Financial crimes and multifaceted corruption engulfed in politics have prevented people enjoying full dividends of democracy and freedom, President Sirisena emphasized.?
?Freedom must not be restricted only to enjoy democratic rights. People must also be provided with economic freedom, freedom from poverty and freedom from discrimination. New technology is an integral part of development. To apply technology to achieve economic progress we will have to rely on foreign countries. But in doing so we must never ever forget the nation?s self respect, dignity, our heritage and culture. While remaining committed to realise an accelerated development we must also be determined to preserve and safeguard our culture, civilization and traditional values,? he said.
??All Sri Lankans must act bravely and diligently to realise their respective aspirations of life, while contributing with dedication and patriotism towards national progress. It is extremely imperative to maintain inter communal interfaith harmony, understanding and mutual respect.?
?Communal mistrust and discrimination breed hate and vengeance among communities which is the biggest motivation for terrorism. That is why this Government always promotes and protects peace and friendship among Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, Malays and Burghers.
??Then only we can build patriotism and exclusiveness among all Sri Lankans,? President Sirisena stressed.?
President Sirisena paid tribute to three armed forces, the Police and Civil Defence Force for their numerous sacrifices made to eradicate LTTE terrorism from the soil of motherland and restoring nation?s independence and territorial integrity.?
The special invitees to the 70th Independence Celebrations of Sri Lanka, Prince Edward ? Earl of Wessex and the youngest son of Queen Elizabeth I and his wife Countess of Wessex, Sophie Rhys-Jones were conspicuous in their presence at the ceremony. A noticeable absentee of this year was the TNA. The members of the joint opposition did not participate in the ceremony as usual.?
After the Address to the Nation by President Sirisena, a Guard of Honour, 21 Gun Salute, an armed forces, police and school cadet parade and a cultural display were followed. The ceremony was made more colourful and exciting with a parachute jumping, an air show by the Sri Lanka Air Force and naval craft display in the sea by Sri Lanka Navy.?
The ceremony was concluded with the singing of the national anthem in Tamil. (Sandun A Jayasekera)?

Independence incomplete sans economic, cultural freedom: Prez
	
In his Independence Day Message, President Maithripala Sirisena today said our independence is not complete until economic and cultural freedom is achieved.
?We must remember that true freedom does not comprise only of political freedom. As a country, our future successes lie in our commitment to achieve long term goals with firm determination, as we have done in the past. Completion of the Moragahakanda reservoir as the last massive step in the Mahaweli development programme is a testimony to our perseverance and commitment to meet such long term goals,? he said.
In terms of achieving human development, President Sirisena said the progress we have achieved is laudable amidst various social, economic and political challenges we were faced with.
?I believe that a nation with a unique identity, we have what it takes to overcome any challenge. We have proven it throughout our history. Today we must show once again that Sri Lanka is a nation that can rise within a short span of time,? he said.
He said many missions including achieving inclusive green growth, national reconciliation and uplifting the quality and competitiveness of our human capital in a global scale, have been undertaken.
President Sirisena also said the nation is grateful to all our heroes who sacrificed their lives in order to restore and sustain our nation?s independence.
?On a day like today, when the value of freedom is commemorated, the nation pays tribute to its true patriots whose contribution to our motherland is invaluable. On this occasion that we celebrate seven decades of independence, I pledge to fulfill all my duties towards mother Lanka, and I emphasize that our true strength is in our unity and determination,? he said.

Udayanga detained at Dubai airport
	
Former Sri Lankan Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga had been reportedly detained at the Dubai Airport this morning, while in transit to the United States, sources said.
He was to be handed over to the Dubai Police by the immigration officers.
Udayanga Weeratunga, Sri Lanka?s former envoy to Russia was accused of being the centre of a probe into the acquisition of MiG-27 fighter jets from Ukraine, while he was also accused of supplying weapons to anti-Government forces.
Interpol arrest warrant was taken in October 2016 following an FCID request made to the Colombo Fort Magistrate.
On January 04, 2017 Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne ordered to suspend the transactions of 16 bank accounts with a balance of USD 1.5 million funds kept by Mr Weeratunga over the inquiry conducted into the huge financial loss caused to the Government in the purchase of Ukraine-built MIG-27 aircraft in 2006.
Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne on January 19 directed Attanagalle and Colombo Land Registrars to prevent the sale of Udayanga Weeratunga's properties found by the FCID, where Rs.40 million and a one-acre land worth of Rs.25 million in Dompe and a luxury apartment (Trillium Residencies) worth Rs.29 million in Borella.
On August 21, 2017, Weeratunga?s request to annul the arrest order was rejected by Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne.
However, Police sources told the Daily Mirror that although Mr Weeratunga was detained at the Dubai Airport it would take a considerable period to return him to country due to diplomatic and legal concerns. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
