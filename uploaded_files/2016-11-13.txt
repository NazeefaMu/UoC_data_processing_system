Budget ignores ethnic reconciliation: TNA
	
The Tamil National Alliance (TNA), which accounts for sixteen of the eighteen Members of Parliament from the Tamil-speaking north and east, said annual budget ignores the pressing issue of ethnic reconciliation.
TNA MP and spokesman M.A.Sumanthiran told Express on Saturday, that the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe appears to have consulted the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), but did not consult the TNA.
The absence of consultation with the TNA is reflected in the lack of concern for reconciliation in the budget, Sumanthiran added. The island nation's budget was present by the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe government on November 10.
In the war-devasted Northern Province, people are struggling to make ends? meet. But there is nothing in the budget for providing them with livelihoods, he said.
The budget, however, encourages the establishment of large scale business projects, but these are not employment providers as such. Among the grandiose projects is a modern vertical building in Jaffna with facilities for business establishments, residences and entertainment to be built at a cost of LKR 1 billion. (US$ 6.7 million). But this is not going to meet the needs of the local people, Sumanthiran said.
In this respect, the present regime seems no different from the Mahinda Rajapaksa government, which launched the Vaddakkin Vasantham (Blooming of the North) project in the Northern Province without considering the needs of a people who had just the emerged battered from a 30-year war. Roads and buildings were built, but virtually nothing was done for livelihood and housing, barring the India-funded and executed 50,000 houses project for war-affected families.

Central Provincial Councillors on study tour to Russia
	
It is reported that another group of Central Provincial Councillors have been given the opportunity to travel to Russia at the expense of the Provincial Council, despite a Presidential directive suspending such foreign visits, a senior politican said.
After news reports that 28 Provincial Councillors and 7 officers were planning an overseas trip with Council funds in Spetember, the President issued a directive suspending such trips. ?
However, a senior politician in the Council said they would visit Russia on a study tour to supplement their knowledge with the advanced technologies used in the developed country to boost development in the Central Province and to uplift the living standard of the people.
He said the group would include 30 members and three senior officials. However, the politician concerned said the air fares and other payments already made from the council funds would not be refunded if the tour was cancelled.
Meanwhile a senior official of the Provincial Council said the government had approved the visit in Russia for a second group of members.(J.A.L.Jayasinghe)

Minimum traffic fine won?t be changed: Ravi
	
Responding to a demand? made by private bus operators to abolish the proposed minimum traffic fine of 2,500 rupees, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said that the proposal was made to save the lives of motorists as well as pedestrians and that the decision won?t be changed.
?Why are the private bus operators so much against the law? asked the minister. He noted that a section of bus operators making such a demand amounted to a tacit admission that they are frequent offenders.
Issuing a statement he said the government will not waver in its commitment to make Sri Lankan roads safer by instilling a greater sense of discipline and respect for traffic rules.
He said that lawlessness, including the rampant disregard for road rules, was one of the biggest problems in the country.
?Over 90 percent of the proposals received by the finance ministry in preparation of the budget called for discipline in all areas with strict adherence to the laws of the country,? he said.
The motive of those who oppose the fines appears to be that they want the government to give them a free license to kill at will and get away with highway murder.
The? traffic fines proposed in the budget? were not a revenue measure, but designed to be a deterrent to ensure that there will be no repetition of offences and there would be an improvement in the safety record of the roads. Therefore, the private bus drivers, or for that matter any other motorist, need not fear the new fines as long as they obey the rules and only those who habitually violate traffic rules will have to pay the fines.
According to police reports, so far this year, nearly 3,000 people have been killed in traffic accidents making Sri Lankan roads among the most dangerous in the world. This is a dubious honour that we must shed. This also surpassed the number of people killed annually in the decades-long separatist war.

Obama had plans to visit SL: Mangala
	
US President Barack Obama had plans to visit Sri Lanka last May, but was unable to do so due to the Vesak Celebrations in the country, Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
?I must reveal something which many people don?t know so far. Last May (2016), even President Obama was ready to come to Sri Lanka which would have been the first ever official visit by an American President. But unfortunately, the dates suggested happened to be Vesak Day (Buddha Purnima day, when Sri Lanka observes grand celebrations for a week) and Vesak week. Such an important visit could not take place during that week, so we missed that amazing opportunity,? he said during an interview with The Hindu.
Full transcript of Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera?s interview to The Hindu
You were in New Delhi recently for the high-level talks on fisheries. The Sri Lankan side has termed the outcome positive and successful. Has India agreed to ban bottom trawling?
The discussion we had in New Delhi last weekend with the Minister of External Affairs [in India] and senior officials was indeed a great success and it demonstrated the political will on both sides of the Palk Strait, to find a solution to this issue, which has been dragging on for far too long at the expense of the poor fishermen, again on both sides of the Palk Strait, who have been suffering because of it [the practice].
Within that context, it was a very important first step that we were able to take. I am quite confident that India too realises the dangers of bottom-trawling, but of course, it has to be resolved in a manner where the fishermen on both sides feel they have won the day. So we have to finally work out a win-win situation and that is why Joint Working Group on fisheries was agreed upon. It will meet here [in Colombo], on the 2nd of January, and would be chaired by the Minister of Fisheries of Sri Lanka as well as the Minister of Agriculture of India. And after that, it will be continued under the chairmanship of the two secretaries. I am sure that we should be able to come to a suitable agreement in the shortest possible time.
As per the commitment you gave the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, you are working on a four-pillar [truth, reconciliation, accountability and non-recurrence] approach to address the legacy of the war. The Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) has been set up, and efforts are on to set up the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) and so on. But there is considerable fear and concern in regard to the draft of the new counter-terrorism law. Is the older security apparatus ? said to have been in place during the previous regime ? yet to be dismantled?
Well, to be frank with you, the ghosts of yesteryears are still very much amongst us. But still the commitment of the government to repeal the earlier Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and introduce a new Prevention of Terrorism Act in keeping with international best practice is as strong as ever.
That?s why the President and the Prime Minister appointed this committee, which also had members that I had appointed from the Foreign Ministry. The committee finally came up with the draft to be referred to the oversight committee. We, here at the Foreign Ministry, also had referred our observations and footnotes to the committee and I am sure that in the final count we should be able to come up with something in keeping with current international trends in fighting international terrorism.
When you say referred your observations and footnotes, do you mean you questioned some of the recommendations? Did you have reservations?
Yes, more than reservations, we have recommended that some of the recommendations of the draft are not in line with international best practices and therefore, should be reconsidered.
You said that the ghosts of the previous regime are lingering?
I should perhaps try to rephrase that. Rather than the ghosts, it would be more appropriate to say the mindset of the older regime, so to speak, is still there ? among certain officials and others. So it?s our duty as a government with a clear mandate for change to ensure that the vision of the government is implemented.
On the former security apparatus ? the Terrorism Investigation Division, the ongoing arrests under the Prevention of Terrorism Act ? do you think there will be a shift in that?
When you have a government, a very authoritarian government, in office for as long as 10 years, it?s not easy to change the mindset created by that era. Just because the governments change, the officials and bureaucracy don?t. It?s not possible to change them all overnight. It?s a gradual process. But that process is taking place.
This is in regard to the U.S. elections. PM Ranil Wickremesinghe has opted for a trade liberalisation platform to improve the economy but President-elect Trump has laid out a protectionist policy for international trade. After your government came to power [in January 2015] U.S.-Lanka ties were visibly reversed?you have very strong relations now. So how will the U.S. election outcome impact this, particularly trade relations?
To begin with, I must say that Sri Lanka has had very good, cordial relations with the U.S. ever since we got Independence in 1948. Of course, there was, as you know, a period of what I call self-imposed isolation by the Rajapaksa administration, not only from the U.S. but with many other countries who were very close to us earlier. We again opened up to the world after January 15, 2015, and I must say that within the last 20 months, Sri Lanka and the U.S. have been able to take their relationship to new levels of excellence.
In fact, within this period itself, we had the Secretary of State John Kerry coming to Sri Lanka ? the first to do so in nearly 40 odd years. We had Samantha Power, the UN Permanent Representative, who is a very, very strong friend of Sri Lanka in the international forum, we have had Nisha Biswal, Tom Malinowski and other senior officials of the State Department who have been in and out many times.
Now I suppose it doesn?t matter, I must reveal something which many people don?t know so far. Last May [2016], even President Obama was ready to come to Sri Lanka which would have been the first ever official visit by an American President. But unfortunately, the dates suggested happened to be Vesak Day [Buddha Purnima day, when Sri Lanka observes grand celebrations for a week] and Vesak week. Such an important visit could not take place during that week, so we missed that amazing opportunity.
But I must say that President Obama did develop a very close relationship with President Sirisena to the extent where President Obama would come up to President Sirisena to say hello at whichever international forum they used to meet. So this shows how far American relations have improved during the recent times.
I hope and I am sure we can build this relationship even further under the Trump administration as well. There are certain concerns about some of the policies which candidate Trump expounded during the campaign but we, here in Sri Lanka, also are very tuned to the fact that what you say at election time is not always what you do when you are elected, because the American system, I am sure, will steer the new administration along the same path as far as international relations are concerned.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry, according to media reports, has defended comments by its ambassador to Sri Lanka on your Finance Minister?s criticism of high interest rates charged on Chinese loans. How do you read that?
I don?t want to read anything into that because China is also a very good friend of ours and a neighbour with whom we have had connections for centuries.Today, China isan importantpartner in Sri Lanka?seconomic development, and the Chinese ambassador is also a good friend of mine. When I recently met him my advice to him was [that] if there are any issues regarding any statements our political leaders may be making, it?s best that those issues are sorted out through the Foreign Ministry channels rather than trying to sort it out through the media, because it?s always in the interest of the media to show conflicts and differences even where there aren?t any conflicts or differences.
With regard to a recent report ? on the bond scam at the country?s Central Bank and the Joint Opposition?s demand that PM Wickremesinghe take responsibility and resign? you think the report has questioned the credibility of the UNP in the unity government?
No, not at all. I would say the COPE report and the scandal, within inverted commas so to speak, have demonstrated the transparency of our government and the UNP. In fact, many people who criticise the government now have forgotten that they have the chance to do so simply because the UNP, and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe himself was the one who suggested, even before we came into government, that the COPE (the Committee on Public Expenses) should be chaired by a member of the Opposition.
Because during the period of President Rajapaksa, the COPE was chaired by members of the government, and ministers of the government who would try to hide all the mistakes, from the very inception itself.
Whereas, it?s only because of Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe and the government that the JVP chairperson was able to show some of the discrepancies of the deal. And now the government has decided to make sure that it is investigated into and I can assure you that action will be taken against anyone who may have broken the law. In this government, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe insists all the time that we cannot continue the culture of impunity, which brought the downfall of the Rajapaksa administration. No one is above the law. No one, is above the law in our government. And justice will be done. But it must be done through the due process. Just because desperate members of the Joint Opposition make all kinds of fantastic allegations, you can?t just take a person or arrest a person. Let the Attorney General study the subject and advise the government on what action to be taken.

Powerful earthquake hits New Zealand
	
The US Geological Survey said the magnitude-7.4 quake hit just after midnight (11:02 GMT on Sunday), some 95km (59 miles) from Christchurch.
The ministry of civil defence has warned people on the east coast of the South Island to move to higher ground in case of tsunamis.
Christchurch is still recovering from the 2011 earthquake that killed 185 people and destroyed the city centre.
New Zealand lies on the notorious Ring of Fire, the line of frequent quakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific rim.
The Herald newspaper said the tremor was felt all the way to Wellington, where sirens sounded and people fled buildings into the streets, some of them crying.
Early reports suggest some houses in Cheviot town, near the epicentre, have been damaged.
A resident of Christchurch said the tremor lasted a "long" time.
"We were asleep and woken to the house shaking, it kept going and going and felt like it was going to build up," she told AFP news agency.
A magnitude-7.1 quake struck 169km (105 miles) north-east of Gisborne on the North Island in September, sparking a tsunami warning. It caused some damage to property, but no injuries. (BBC)

US to take Australia asylum seekers on Nauru and Manus Island
	
Australia and the US have reached a resettlement deal for asylum seekers held in offshore detention centres in Papua New Guinea and Nauru.
Under the agreement, the migrants there will be assessed and the most vulnerable will be resettled in the US.
About 1,200 people are being held in the asylum centres on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea and on Nauru island.
Australia's policy of sending migrants who arrive by boat to offshore facilities has been criticised.
Announcing the deal with the US on Sunday, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the resettlement process would be gradual.
"US authorities will conduct their own assessment of refugees and decide which people are resettled in the US," he said.
He did not say how many refugees would be relocated, but said that women, children and families would be prioritised.
The agreement, to be administered with the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR, is available only to those currently in the processing centres.
"It is a one-off agreement. It will not be repeated," Mr Turnbull said.
US Secretary of State John Kerry confirmed the arrangement, adding that his country was "very engaged" with the UNHCR and helping refugees "there and in other parts of the world".
Refugees who are eligible for asylum in the US but reject it would be offered a 20-year Nauru visa instead.
Mr Turnbull said that the detainees who have had asylum applications rejected should return to their home countries.
Earlier this year, Australia said it planned to shut the Manus Island asylum centre, although a closing date has not been announced.
The government has faced condemnation over conditions at the two detention centres, which are run by private companies.
In August, leaked "incident reports", which the companies are contractually obliged to provide, revealed that self-harm and violence were commonplace at the centre in Nauru.
Australia has been repeatedly criticised for its tough policy on refugees and asylum seekers.
Last month an Amnesty International report said the conditions imposed on asylum seekers was a "deliberate policy to inflict harm".(BBC)

Villagers who protested release of MP?s nephew in fatal accident to be arrested
	
The Thelikada Police had informed the Court that it would soon arrest five more villagers, who protested over a release of a 17-year-old nephew of Opposition MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena, in connection with a fatal accident in Hikkaduwa..
Around 500 villagers in Gonapeenuwala, Hikkaduwa took to the streets in a protest against the release of the under-aged suspect, who was charged in the fatal accident which killed a 27-year-old and a 28-year-old in September, 2016.
The Police later arrested three of the protesters, on charges of public nuisance.
However, when the case was taken up in court recently, the Police informed court that they were preparing to arrest five more protesters.
The villagers alleged the dead youths were subjected to grave injustice because those who are responsible for the deaths were released on bail.
Preliminary investigations had revealed that at the time of the accident five persons were travelling in a speeding sports car.
The car was driven by the under-aged suspect Navin Kanishka Abeygunawardena who was under the influence of alcohol and did not have a driving licence. (Jayakantha Liyanage)
