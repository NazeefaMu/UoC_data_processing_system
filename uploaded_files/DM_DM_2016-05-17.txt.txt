He laughed off their request
	
Providing accommodation and other basic facilities to dozens of purohitas at various levels has set a poser to the yahapalanaya government.

A group of purohitas recently called on a high political authority to make representations about the difficulties they were undergoing for want of basic facilities to carry out their official functions.
The purohita who led the delegation presenting their case to the high political authority told him. None of us have got office accommodation at council complex. Why do you want office rooms here the high authority asked with obvious levity.
Sir, we have to have a place where we can attend to our official functions!
(The political authority points to a purohita in the delegation). You speak to this colleague. He knows well about the office rooms available here. The other day he dashed into a room here and later found himself in hospital...
They all laughed, but their problem remained unsolved.

India cant be trusted as genuine trade partner: GMOA
	
GMOA President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya said yesterday that his organisation was not against India but that the country cant be trusted as a genuine trade partner.
Addressing a forum under the theme Lets defeat the ETCA invader, he alleged India had already ruined Nepal and identified India as a dishonest and unfair trade partner.
He said so called economic consultants who were promoting the Indo-Sri Lanka Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) had claimed that Sri Lanka should sign as many as trade agreements it could and the pacts should be signed as soon as possible if the country to be developed.
If this is true, Nepal should be the most developed country today. It had signed more than ten trade agreements but it is still at the bottom of economic development, Dr. Padeniya told the forum which was organised by the Duty-Discussion Panel headed by Gevindu Kumaratunga.
Dr. Padeniya highlighted that Sri Lanka lacked a national policy on foreign trade agreements unlike India and said the existing Indo-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (ISFTA) which was implemented since 2000, was in favour of India.
If we are to expand the ISFTA into a service sector, we should first review it. More importantly, we should draft a national policy on foreign trade agreements. A proper mechanism should be set up on the proposed agreement with clear cut benefits and expectations. We are also in need of an authority which should take responsibility of drafting the agreements, he said adding that its better to dump the agreement into the ocean than allowing Parliament to draft it.
He warned that they would launch stern trade union action without further notice if the ETCA was signed.
Meanwhile, Senior Lecturer Dr. Lalithasiri Gunaruwan of the Colombo Universitys Economics Department also said the faults in the ISFTA should be addressed before signing a new agreement. We should rectify faults and make the agreement viable instead of jumping into a more complicated one with the false hope of better results, he said.
He said Indias behaviour was suspicious and it was suspicious whether they were attempting to poke their fingers in nerve centres in Sri Lanka and to loot profits. To make this process easier, we have Sri Lankan match-fixers who are playing for India, he alleged. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

## Title: Japan lenders profits hit by Bank of Japan negative rate move

Japan lenders profits hit by Bank of Japan negative rate move
	
AFP - The Bank of Japans shock negative rate policy is taking a bite out of profits at major banks, with Mitsubishi UFJ yesterday warning over its bottom line.
The huge lender said its net profit fell 8.0 percent to 951.4 billion yen ($8.7 billion) in the fiscal year to March, blaming the drop on a slowdown in the economy, sluggish equity markets, and low interest rates.
Rivals Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group and Mizuho Financial Group said last week that negative rates were also squeezing their lending margins.
In January, Japans central bank surprised markets with the negative rate policy, which was designed to boost lending to people and businesses, and stoke growth in the wider economy.
But the move -- which effectively charges commercial banks for keeping excess in Bank of Japan vaults, giving them an incentive to lend more -- was widely criticised as a desperate bid to prop up Tokyos faltering economic growth blitz.
Bankers were among the policys biggest critics including Mitsubishi UFJs chief executive Nobuyuki Hirano, who warned it would hurt lenders finances as they battle to drive up already sluggish lending.
We expect to see an acceleration in the contraction of domestic interest margins associated with the BoJs introduction of negative rates, said Akira Takai, a Tokyo-based analyst at Daiwa Securities Group.
Separately, Mitsubishi UFJ on Monday for the first time appointed two women to executive positions in its core banking unit.
The relatively unusual move -- Japan Incs top ranks are overwhelmingly male -- comes as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has called on firms to boost the role of women as part of his wider bid to kickstart the worlds number three economy.
The BoJs new policy has hurt lenders share prices, making them the worst performers on the Tokyo Stock Exchange this year.
Their earnings have also been under pressure owing to a slowdown in Asian economies and while theyve had to boost their allowances for bad debts. Last week, Sumitomo Mitsui said its net profit dropped 14 percent to 646.7 billion yen for the past fiscal year.
Mizuhos net profit rose for the latest period, but it also warned that its profits would come under pressure this year.
Japans banking system has undergone huge changes over the past two decades, including numerous mergers that have lead to a sharply reduced number of large institutions. Years of ultra-low interest rates have pressured profitability and pushed them to seek expansion overseas.

About 450 persons from 200 families were displaced and 16 sustained injuries when a landslide occurred in the interior of Aranayake, Mawanella this evening, police said.
Ratnapura District DIG Rohan Dias said the villages of Siripura, Elangapitiya and Pallebage in the Aranayake Police Division were reported to have been buried under a landslide that occurred at around 6.00pm today.
Around 200 families are believed to have been living in the villages and 80 of them had moved to safer places according to the DIG.
14 of the injured persons have been admitted to Aranayake Hospital and two to Mawanella Hospital.
Meanwhile Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, who visited the site of the landslide, said boulders were falling from the higher elevations towards the area where the tragedy had taken place together with gushing waters.
This situation prevented the police and army from reaching the site, he said. He said a thick mist was a further hindrance.
The minister said a medical team with the necessary equipment was kept ready for the rescue operations which would be resumed this morning. Air Force helicopters were also expected to be called in for the rescue operations.
This is the worst landslide in the country since the Meeriyabeddha landslide of October 2014, which killed at least 16 people and buried 200 people whose bodies were not recovered. (Chaturanga Pradeep, Yohan Perera and Rohan Kumara)

One single tenderer wins all contracts
	
The authorities wanted to procure an assortment of goods for a state-run institution concerned with vocational training and invited separate competitive bids for four categories of items from prospective suppliers.
Tenders from a number of suppliers were received, duly processed and finally  believe it or not - the contracts worth a total of Rs.386 million awarded to one and the same tenderer -- a certain firm.
An individual who functioned as the head of a leading state-owned bank during the previous regime is said be to having close ties with this firm that successfully tendered for the lucrative supply contract and part of the earnings of this firm is reportedly being utilized to finance a political grouping led by some prominent figures of the previous regime, they say.
Meanwhile, complaints have been made that the goods supplied by the firm are sub-standard and are not supplied on time either. The political authority handling the subject has appointed a particular secretary to inquire into these complaints despite there being clear evidence that he was the main figure behind the rigging of the tender procedure, they say.

RTI will make Sri Lanka a better place: US
	
US Ambassador Atul Keshap said yesterday that enshrining citizens Right to Information (RTI) will give Sri Lankans the tools to make their country a better place and prevent any return to an era of secrecy and a lack of accountability.
The task of strengthening good governance anywhere in the world is never easy, but enshrining citizens Right to Information in legislation will be an important step in the right direction. Such legislation will give Sri Lankans the tools to make their country a better place, and prevent any return to an era of secrecy and a lack of accountability, he told an Interactive Dialogue on the RTI held at the Waters Edge Hotel in Colombo.

The full speech of the Ambassador

It is an honor to address this gathering as you discuss the creation of a Right to Information bill designed to enhance citizens access to transparency and insight about their government.
Any democracy requires that government officials be accountable to the citizens who elected them, and that accountability requires transparency. Your discussions today reflect a growing consensus in the global community  as reflected in the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals  for countries to ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms. 
This year, ladies and gentlemen, the United States will celebrate the 50-year anniversary of our own Freedom of Information Act, set up to ensure our citizens have the right to monitor what their government does. Its passage was not easy. First championed by a lawmaker from California in 1955, he could not find enough support until years later, in 1966. And even upon enactment, it was opposed by every U.S. federal agency and department. 
But what we have learned over these years is that transparency leads to better governance, a government more truly by the people and for the people, as enshrined in our constitution. And our version of the Right to Information has continued to evolve with amendments and improvements to better reflect our unique national circumstances and changes in communications technologies. 
The bottom line is that we understand information maintained by the federal government is a national asset that needs to be readily accessible by the public. As President Obama stated on his first day on the job, In the face of doubt, openness prevails. 
Just as President Obama made government transparency one of his first priorities, I am also encouraged by similar pledges from President Sirisena, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, and other top government officials in Sri Lanka. Certainly, the last elections have shown that Sri Lankas voters consider government transparency a priority. 
As Secretary Kerry promised during his visit a year ago, the United States will stand by your side as you make progress on these important good governance reforms and human rights commitments.
As reflected in our increased cooperation over the past 16 months, our diplomatic relations are at an all-time high. Our development cooperation in 2015 and 2016 totaled almost $40 million per annum, and the administration has requested a similar amount in fiscal year 2017. As a result of your commitment to good governance and ruling justly, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is working with Sri Lanka to design a threshold program that can potentially unlock millions in additional assistance to boost economic growth.
In February, our governments launched the U.S.-Sri Lanka Partnership Dialogue, which expands and reinforces our whole-of-government cooperation in development, governance, energy, trade, and security. We also had our first ship visit to Colombo in eleven years in March.
Through our increasingly close partnership, we are exploring new avenues to strengthen Sri Lankas economy. In April, we hosted the U.S.-Sri Lanka Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) Council Meeting in Washington, which will further intensify our trade and business relations. We have launched programs to train Sri Lankan business leaders and government officials in best practices for the tourism industry, a sector with great promise for expansion. Experience has shown that businesses and investors  both foreign and domestic  prefer governance systems that are transparent and where officials are held accountable for their decisions and actions. We are finalizing efforts to lend expertise on public financial management reforms over the next two years.
Our initiatives are also helping to establish a stable post-conflict society across Sri Lanka. U.S. Agency for International Development-supported projects help strengthen the rule of law, build a robust civil society, and strengthen democracy and prosperity. At the request of your government, we are now supporting reforms through assistance focused on public financial management, the Elections Commission, and the Parliament.
All of these build upon the decades of steadfast U.S. support designed to help create jobs and prosperity, ensure food security and access to clean water, support womens livelihoods and well-being, and help citizens recover from natural disasters.
The task of strengthening good governance anywhere in the world is never easy, but enshrining citizens Right to Information in legislation will be an important step in the right direction. Such legislation will give Sri Lankans the tools to make their country a better place, and prevent any return to an era of secrecy and a lack of accountability.
These are the promises your government made to its voters before the elections last year. You understood that a preponderant majority of well-meaning Sri Lankans want to transition to an era of reconciliation, unity, peace, democracy, and rule of law. I applaud your resolve to help Sri Lanka restore its standing in the international community, including, notably, through historic co-sponsorship of the UN Resolution that pledges Sri Lanka to tread the difficult but essential path toward reconciliation, truth, justice, and non-recurrence of conflict for all.
There are other important decisions before you, the leaders of your people, including some that will require principled leadership and determination in order to set this country firmly on a path towards greater and lasting peace and prosperity. The effort to make the Constitution more fair and inclusive, to reflect and celebrate the diversity of Sri Lanka, to ensure equal rights and opportunity for all Sri Lankans, to empower citizens to achieve their full potential, reflects a courageous, positive, and principled vision. 
As you, acting as your citizens elected representatives, seize this rare and historic moment to effect lasting and positive change, please know that the people and government of the United States stand with you and will walk by your side as friends.
Some of these needed reforms are not easy, but the new atmosphere of peace and democracy in Sri Lanka affords you a precious opportunity to effect needed change. Replacing the outdated Prevention of Terrorism Act with a new national security legal architecture can help not only prevent future abuses, but also ensure stronger defenses against modern threats to Sri Lanka, and to it democracy and citizens rights. 
All of you understand the heart-breaking need to create a credible and effective institution to bring truth, resolution, and justice to those families who lost loved ones on both sides of the war, and to foster a lasting climate of reconciliation and brotherhood after so many years of conflict. 
Your government has launched a discussion with ordinary citizens and civil society to determine the best way forward, and we look forward to steady progress toward healing these wounds, including the establishment of an Office of Missing Persons, and other helpful steps.
As you proceed with your discussions on the Right to Information, your work will send clear signals of Sri Lankas commitment to reform and good governance. You are truly fortunate to serve your citizenry at a historic and golden moment when the vast majority of Sri Lankans want a better and more positive future, free of war and racism, and marked by mutual respect, harmony, democracy, transparency, and prosperity. 
It is also your good luck to enjoy an opportunity after many decades of strife to send a powerful message to the international community that Sri Lanka is truly back on the global stage, a model democracy with innovative solutions to post-conflict transitions, and dedicated to fulfilling its UN commitments.
Thank you once again for inviting me to speak before you. The United States looks forward to opportunities to provide more support, bring more resources, and share more expertise in your efforts to restore Sri Lankas rightful place as a leader in the international community, one that contributes to the global economy; promotes human rights, accountability, transitional justice, and democracy; and that helps to uphold international law.
I wish you the best of luck for a meaningful dialogue today, and the successful passage of this important legislation, a key element on the path towards good governance.

SL agrees to provide land to Indian MP for Sita temple
	
Bhopal: India'sMadhya Pradesh (India) government will soon start the construction of a grand temple of Sita, wife of Lord Rama, in Sri Lanka at the place where she underwent agni pariksha (an ordeal of fire). The island nation has agreed to provide a piece of land for the purpose.
An ambitious project of chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, it has been hanging fire for the last five years. In the past, Chouhan himself had visited the places in the island nation associated with mythological characters of Rama and Sita. In the last week of April, a top bureaucrat of MP government visited Sri Lanka to finalise various issues related to the temple, including its architectural design among others. RSS leader Ram Madhav has also been evincing keen interest in the project, government sources claimed. Chouhan had first proposed the project in September 2012 when the then Sri Lankan president Mahinda Rajapaksa visited Sanchi to inaugurate University of Buddhist-Indic Studies.
The temple is likely to be constructed at Divurumpola, a place which the Sri Lankan government claims to be the site where Sita underwent the agni pariksha. During the recent visit of Sri Lankan president Maithripala Sirisena to Simhastha in Ujjain and later to Sanchi on May 14, the chief minister discussed the issue again.
"The government is still working on various issues like who would maintain the temple after its construction is over. It is likely to be maintained by India Foundation, an organisation with which RSS leader Ram Madhav is involved," sources claimed. (Times of India)

SriLankan to cut staff to look pretty for a business partner
	
Sri Lankas national carrier is gearing up to shed some weight by way of a human resource restructuring programme to ensure the bride is ready for a prospective match, according to the debt-laden airlines chairman.
Admitting the enterprise is overstaffed, SriLankan Airlines Chairman Ajith Dias affirmed that employee downsizing is definitely on the cards, a move if carried out successfully, would help cut down the airlines expenditure by a sizable portion.
Rightsizing SriLankan Airlines is part of the restructuring plans which has to be done for the company to be ready for a public-private partnership (PPP). Its a tough call but it has to be done. Its what the government wants us to do. If we dont get about this endeavour, nobody will want to partner with us, said Dias in an interview with Mirror Business.
He said the downsizing exercise should be completed by end-September, by when a suitable partner would be picked.
We hav e to prep a r e ourselves for anybody who will be coming in as a partner. We have to dress up the bride, quipped Dias, while asserting the need for the move.
Although the initial discussions regarding the move have already been started, the exact number of staff that would be laid off and at which levels is yet to be decided. SriLankan Airlines provides employment for nearly 6,800 individuals. Dias shared that while the management is in the midst of studying the current employee scenario, services of a foreign consultancy firm would be sought for expert advice and to ensure the exercise is carried out with least impact.
According to him, the decision to right size was taken several weeks ago and it has already been communicated to the trade unions, which, Dias said, were not surprised by the move.
We have talked to the unions and everyone has realised that we cannot carry on like this. So far they have been positive. They too realise the need for this exercise and we also have explained to them the clear need for it, shared Dias.
When questioned as to how the surplus staff would be reduced, he said a number of options would be explored and a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) would be one of the modes of execution.
How it will be executed is not firm as yet. But it will happen. We need to make sure it is done in the smoothest way possible to reduce implications, Dias added.
According to government estimates, SriLankan has accumulated losses of Rs.128 billion (US $ 872 million) on top of a massive debt pile of US $ 933 million. (Shabiya Ali Ahlam)

What type of retiree will you be Find out on AIAs Facebook page
	

You may not have even thought about your retirement as yet, but it is inevitable. It makes sense that you take a minute to think about what sort of a retirement you fancy, so you can start planning early to make sure it turns out just the way you want it to!
That is exactly what AIAs latest Facebook application makes you do. The first of its kind in Sri Lanka, the What type of retiree are you personality test allows you to pick from a selection of future lifestyles, so you can get a glimpse of what your future could have in store.
Where would you like to live at retirement Perhaps a luxury apartment, a serene villa, a cosy cottage or an elders home Would you like to ride around in a luxury, standard or cost effective vehicle or will you opt for public transport And of course one of the most enjoyable things about retirement
is travel, so do you look forward to luxury holiday destinations around the world, will you limit it to inland travel only, or will you be happy just watching the travel channel!
Whatever your retirement aspirations may be, its best you start thinking about it early, so you can afford the retirement you dream of. As AIAs Head of Marketing Suren Perera pointed out, people dont realize that there is a gap between what they will have at the point of retirement and what they will actually need to live the lifestyle they want. A typical retiree will live up to 25 years after retirement and this can perhaps be the best time of their lives, provided they can afford all the things they want to do.
He added, That is why we developed this game, to urge Sri Lankans to actually start thinking about their futures, in a fun and engaging way, while realizing their own future aspirations.
As Asias leading insurer AIA is committed to creating awareness on the importance of planning ahead, being prepared and closing the gap between what you have and what you will need for a comfortable retirement.

Wimal hits out at Mervyn's mask
	
Former Minister Mervyn Silvas formation of the actual joint opposition was a pre-Vesak mask performance scripted by President Maithripala Sirisena, the National Freedom Party (NFF) claimed yesterday.
Addressing a media briefing, NFF leader Wimal Weerawansa said the government had started to present Vesak mask performances even before the dawn of Vesak.
Such a dance was staged at Kelaniya by using a banner which bears the name of the joint opposition, he added.
Mr. Weerawansa said he requested the President to refrain from making comics despite a situation where the people were unbearably burdened.
Responding to a media query, regarding the possibility of Mr. Silva joining hands with the joint opposition, Mr. Weerawansa said that would never happen.
We have never thought of such unification. Even Mr. Silva has not asked for it, he added.(Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Beyonce brand Ivy Park denies slavery in Lankan factory
	
Beyonces workout clothing line, Ivy Park, has denied claims by The Sun newspaper of running a sweatshop in its Sri Lanka factory, the Irish Examiner reported today.
It has been alleged that Beyonces sportswear brand is made by workers who earn 44 pence an hour in squalid conditions.
The range was created to support and inspire women, but its Sri Lankan workers earn just 4.30 sterling pounds a day, the Sun tabloid had claimed.
The Sun reported that Anti-Slavery International campaigner Jakub Sobik has attacked Beyonces brand, saying: With what is being described here, this is a form of sweat-shop slavery
Companies like Topshop have a duty to find out if these things are happening, and it has long been shown that ethical inspections by these companies are failing.
The company is not breaking any laws, as the legal minimum wage in Sri Lanka is 13,500 rupees a month  or 140  but campaigners feel it should be 43,000 rupees, or 450.
A Topshop spokesperson defended Beyonces range: Ivy Park has a rigorous ethical trading programme. We are proud of our sustained efforts, in terms of factory inspections and audits, and our teams work very closely with our suppliers and their factories to ensure compliance.

Chinese executive confesses to $800m fraud
	
AFP - The alleged mastermind of a scam which cost Chinese investors hundreds of millions of dollars lived in a penthouse flat featuring peacocks and fountains, reports said yesterday after he was paraded on television confessing.
Xu Qin, described as the controller of Zhongjin Asset Management and its linked companies, was among 35 executives and employees formally arrested last week in connection with the scheme, state-run Dragon Television reported at the weekend.
It owes more than half its 25,000 investors a total of 5.2 billion yuan ($800 million) said the broadcaster, which is based in the commercial hub. Xu, 35, was shown saying that the firm paid back previous investors principal and interest with money from new investors.
It is actually a typical Ponzi scheme, he admitted. He squandered around 500 million yuan of investors money on luxury houses and cars with his wife, the report alleged.
It was the latest example of a suspect being shown on Chinese state television confessing to crimes, often before he or she has appeared in court. Overseas rights groups have condemned the practice and say the interviews may be carried out under duress, with some senior Chinese lawyers also expressing concern.
Xu and his wife rented a 1,200 square metre (13,000 square foot) penthouse at one of Chinas most expensive developments, Tomson Riviera in Shanghai, where he raised peacocks and built fountains in his living room, state-run newspaper Jiefang Daily reported on Monday.
The case is the latest financial fraud to emerge as Chinas economy slows. In a recent scandal, peer-to-peer lending firm Ezubao bilked 900,000 investors out of $7.6 billion by offering high interest rates which it was unable to pay, in what one executive described in a televised confession as a typical Ponzi scheme.
Police in Shanghai could not be reached for comment on Xus confession, but previously said he registered more than 50 subsidiaries and controlled 100 linked companies.
