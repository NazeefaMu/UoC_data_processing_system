Video: Obtaining enjoining order blow to freedom of information
	
Former UPFA MP Rajiva Wijesinha said today that the obtaining of an enjoining order, preventing the publication or circulation of the COPE sub committee draft report on the sale of Central Bank bonds, was a huge blow to the freedom of information.
?We cannot speak about the COPE report till July 23. We accept that. We believe that it would make people realise that the deputy minister of justice is obstructing the freedom of information. Why is the report being suppressed," he asked.
Prof. Wijesinha said he was prepared for a public debate with Deputy Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe over the Bond issue.
He alleged that the UNP had directly intervened in the Bond issue by instructing the Central Bank Governor through UNP Chairman Malik Samarawickreme, General Secretary Kabir Hashim and Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake and added that it was done to raise funds for the election.
Prof. Wijesinghe said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had also intervened in the Bond issue and this had been proved by his attempts to suppress the investigations.(Ajith Siriwardana)WATCH ?

Bring back, Oh Bring Back, Bring Back Mahinda to ?Temple Trees?....
	
?My Bonnie lies over the ocean?My Bonnie lies over the sea?My Bonnie lies over the ocean?Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me?...?Bring back, bring back?Oh, Bring back my Bonnie to me, to me
	?Bring back, bring back
?Oh, Bring back my Bonnie to me?- ? ? ? ? ?Traditional Scottish Folk SongBy D.B.S.Jeyaraj
?My Bonnie lies over the Ocean? was a Scottish folk song quite popular in Sri Lanka in those days. No sing- song at a party was complete without spirited revellers ?exuberantly ?chorusing ?Bring back, bring back, Oh bring back ?my Bonnie to me, to me?. Interestingly enough, these lines have been regularly ?buzzing in my head ?ever since the ?Bring back Mahinda? movement began gathering momentum. It seemed as if ?I was ?hearing the cheerleaders of the Bring back Mahinda movement - Udaya, Wimal, Dinesh and Vasu in their ?Alto, Soprano, Bass and ?Tenor voices - singing lustily ?Oh bring back ?Apey? Mahinda to ?Temple Trees!
?
	"Maithripala Sirisena had failed to win the numerical ?majority of the ?ethnic majority. It was estimated that 55% of ?votes cast by members of ?the Sinhala community had been in favour of Mahinda Rajapaksa. On the ?other hand estimates said 81% of voters ?from the three ?ethnic ?minorities namely the Sri Lankan Tamils, ?Muslims and Indian Tamils had ?polled for Maithripala Sirisena. This had helped offset the disadvantage ?suffered by Sirisena in the Sinhala constituency and entitled him to ?overall victory. Though the final ?result had favoured Sirisena , he was ?unable to win over the majority of the Sinhalese. Since the Sinhalese ?comprise 74 % of the total population and Rajapaksa had ?won over half ?of the ?Sinhala? votes"
?There is another ?political? dimension to my imagined link between this Scottish folk song and the Bring back Mahinda movement. The folk song has a political history. It is widely believed that the origin of this popular song is tied up with the fate ?of Charles Edward Louis Philip Casimir Stuart whose loyalists called him ?Bonnie Prince Charlie?. The ?Bonnie? in the song apparently refers to Bonnie Prince Charlie whose loyalists were yearning for his return from political exile abroad.
?Charles Edward Stuart?s grandfather King James the second of England and Seventh of Scotland had been deposed.James fled to Europe from where he laid claim to the English and Scottish thrones. After his death his ?son ?also named James ?followed suit and was dubbed the ?The Pretender?. Thereafter his ?son ?prince Charles popularly ?known as ?Bonnie Prince Charlie? also claimed both thrones and earned the nickname ?young pretender?. Charles ?too wanted the throne to be restored to the Stuart dynasty.Bonnie Prince Charlie
?Charles ?raised an army and crossed over from France ?to Scotland where he revolted against King George the first.Bonnie Prince Charlie gained the support of many Scottish clans who wanted the throne to go to him. He won some battles initially. However Bonnie prince Charlie was conclusively defeated by the Duke of Cumberland at the battle of Culloden in 1746.?Bonnie? was forced to flee to Europe from where he plotted and planned to launch another invasion and re- claim the Scottish throne.
His supporters also longed for the restoration of the Stuart dynasty. It was then a treasonable offence to profess support to Bonnie Prince Charlie. So many resorted to subterfuge in expressing support. One such example was the popularity of this folk song. Overtly it appeared to be a romantic song with the lover hoping for a return of his Bonnie who was across the ocean and sea. The term Bonnie also refers to a Scottish lass. So the supporters of Bonnie Prince Charlie pretended that they were singing a ?song of ?a lovelorn lad about his ?bonnie lass while secretly they yearned for ? their own ? Bonnie? Prince ?to return. And so they sang openly ?Bring back, bring back Oh Bring back my Bonnie to me ?to me?.
?
	"Mahinda Rajapaksa erred grievously in calling for premature Presidential ?elections and suffered bitter defeat. ?Goliath? Mahinda was slain ?through the ballot ?by ?David? Maithripala.The circumstances leading to ?Mahinda Rajapaksa?s ?defeat have been related and analysed ad nauseam ? by numerous political pundits"
Sadly for the supporters of Bonnie Prince Charlie their hero and idol never ascended the throne of Scotland. Despite all the singing about bringing back Bonnie, the young pretender could never cross the channel again. He spent ?many years in Europe planning and plotting to raise an army again and invade the British isles. These plans did not succeed and Charles finally died on foreign soil without realising his cherished ambition of claiming the throne for the Stuart dynasty. His supporters in Scotland kept singing their bring back Bonnie song ?to no avail like unrequited lovers. The only good thing that came of it all was a welcome addition to the repertoire of popular folk songs.
In contemporary Sri Lanka the situation is one where a ?cabal of Rajapaksa acolytes are clamouring for a return of Mahinda Percy Rajapaksa to power. The Mahinda lobby feels that unlike the fate that befell Bonnie Prince Charlie who never came back to Scotland, the future decreed by fate for their hero is bright. The ?Bring Back Mahinda? movement seems very optimistic that the people are with them and that the outcome of their efforts would indeed ?be rosy. If the first political journey of Mahinda Rajapaksa ?brought him to ?Janadhipathi Mandiraya? the second ?Mahindagamana? too is expected to reach its destination namely ?Temple Trees?. The ?Mahinda movement? now out of power hopes to taste power again by rising up with ?Mahinda.?Machiavelli of Medamulana?
The political strategists ?and ideologues of ?raising the ?Bring Back Mahinda? demand would have us believe that theirs is but ?an echo of ?what the masses are crying out for. It is being projected that there is a gigantic groundswell of support for the return of Mahinda Rajapaksa to power and that the Mahinda movement is only a spontaneous ?expression of that yearning. The truth however is somewhat different. It is indeed ?a fact that ?a sizable ?section of the Sri Lankan population ?wants Mahinda Rajapaksa at the helm again. The Bring back Mahinda movement however is a well organized entity. It is the cutting edge of a ?carefully planned and co-ordinated strategy to enthrone Mahinda Rajapaksa. ?The orchestrated movement is but an important component of a grand strategy to ? re-capture power. The supreme architect of this strategy aiming to ?regain the lost paradise of political power ?seems to be none other than the ?Machiavelli of Medamulana? himself.
Mahinda Rajapaksa erred grievously in calling for premature Presidential elections and suffered bitter defeat. ?Goliath? Mahinda was slain through the ballot ?by ?David? Maithripala.The circumstances leading to Mahinda Rajapaksa?s ?defeat have been related and analysed ad nauseam ?by numerous political pundits . They need no repetition here at this juncture. What is interesting even more than the defeat of Mahinda Rajapaksa is the on going ?attempt by the ex-president to rise up from that defeat and transform the ?prevailing political equation. The political fightback of Mahinda Rajapaksa ?after electoral defeat provides a fascinating study for political observers as well students of politics.
The forces that tasted victory in the Jan 8 elections refer to that success as a democratic ?revolution?. By the same ?yardstick any attempt to ?roll ?back the gains achieved ?by such election results ?can ?be ?construed as a ?counter revolution?. Those ?victors who claim ?the Jan 8 election was a revolution ?decry efforts by those ?seeking ?a Rajapaksa resurgence as attempts to stage a ?counter revolution. This ?revolution terminology helps to focus ?attention on the qualitative nature of Mahinda Rajapaksa?s political fightback. In a sense ?Mahinda Rajapaksa?s ?overall ?political strategy to return to power seems to be ?influenced to some extent by the basic principles of revolutionary warfare. One is able to see the ?core guidelines of protracted guerilla warfare being reflected to a certain extent ?in the political mission of regaining power.Silver Linings
Mahinda Rajapaksa was in a beleaguered state after facing defeat on the night of January 8th 2015. Bleak prospects were in ?store for him in a post?defeat situation. These ranged from legal action for alleged offences in domestic tribunals to punitive censure in International fora. There were however ?silver linings in the dark cloud of defeat that was threatening to envelope him.?
?
	"The president reverting back to the party he had deserted to contest as ?common presidential candidate irked the UNP. Sirisena?s ?political ?godmother Chandrika Kumaratunga was also annoyed. The cracks began to ?appear"
Firstly ?the victorious Maithripala Sirisena had failed to win the numerical ?majority of the ethnic majority. It was estimated that 55% of ?votes cast by members of the Sinhala community had been in favour of Mahinda Rajapaksa. On the other hand estimates said 81% of voters ?from the three ?ethnic minorities namely the Sri Lankan Tamils, ?Muslims and Indian Tamils had polled for Maithripala Sirisena. This had helped offset the disadvantage suffered by Sirisena in the Sinhala constituency and entitled him to overall victory. Though the final ?result had favoured Sirisena , he was unable to win over the majority of the Sinhalese. Since the Sinhalese comprise 74 % of the total population and Rajapaksa had ?won over half of the ?Sinhala? votes, ?Medamulana Mahinda could not be easily written off politically.Even though some sneeringly apply a racist veneer to this support ?the fact remains that it is indeed a strong point in Mahinda?s favour and grants him considerable political clout.
Secondly the ?United Peoples Freedom ?Alliance (UPFA) and its premier constituent the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) had been firmly opposed to the ultimate victor Maithripala Sirisena. Individuals and parties from the SLFP and UPFA may have thrown in their lot with Sirisena at the hustings but the SLFP and the SLFP led UPFA ?were organizationally intact and firmly behind Mahinda Rajapaksa. It was anticipated earlier that the ?Vaasi Pattata Hoiya? syndrome would prevail after the Sirisena victory and that Parliamentarians would ?desert the SLFP/UPFA in large numbers. Several MP?s did cross, ?but the bulk of MP?s did not. Even some of the ?crossers over? were fifth columnists bent on sabotage.
The expected large scale desertion did not happen mainly because the election result had demonstrated that the majority of Sinhala voter support was still with Mahinda. Thus most MP?s opted to stay put with Mahinda rather than hitch their wagon to the Maithripala star. Besides there was sub-terranean hostility towards Maithripala within the rank and file. Sirisena may be hailed as a saviour of democracy by the likes of ?British premier David Cameron and US secretary of state John Kerry but to the local SLFP stalwart Maithripala is a hated ? politician ?who betrayed his party by crossing ?over ?and then forming a government dominated by the UNP. As ?former US Congress speaker ?Tip? O?Neill famously observed ?All politics is local.?
Thirdly and perhaps most importantly the results of the Presidential election were not accurately reflected in Parliament. It was a minority government that was in power under Prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. The chief opposition United National Party (UNP) was ensconced in power as the government while the SLFP which still retained the bulk of seats in Parliament was in the Opposition. ?Parliament was entitled to continue till 2016 April.This was a unique situation that ?could be put right only after ?early dissolution of Parliament and fresh elections. Even then a hung Parliament could not be ruled out. The situation was one where a numerically larger opposition could call the shots in Parliament. Despite the trappings of office the ruling regime was in actuality a lame duck government. An unelected minority government installed in power by a quirk of fate is prone to disaster in the long run.?Trading Space for Time?
These silver linings therefore provided Mahinda Rajapaksa with the ?space? to manouevre politically. Basic tenets ?of guerilla warfare emphasise the need to ?trade space for time? when required. In Mahinda?s case too he needed to trade off space to acquire more time. This time was essential to delay or ward off an anticipated political offensive by the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe-Kumaratungas triumvirate and also to launch the counter offensive to regain lost political ground. So Mahinda Rajapaksa ?began trading off the political space he had.
A chain is as strong as its weakest link. As far as the Maithri-Ranil-Chandrika trio was concerned the weakest link was perceived as President Sirisena. During the election campaign Mahinda had ?stated that the fight was really between ?Chandrika and himself. He also identified Ranil and the UNP as arch-rivals. Maithripala however was a different kettle of fish. The man whom Mahinda accused of ?eating egg hoppers with him ?at night and committing political treachery in the morning was a sturdy son of the Rajarata soil with old fashioned values. Apart from a brief flirtation with Rohana Wijeweera?s Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) in his youth, Maithripala Sirisena had been a loyal SLFPer throughout. Sirisena was not an aristocrat but true ?blue? blood ran in his veins.
In Oscar Wilde?s ?Lady Windermere?s Fan?, the ?character ?Cecil Graham queries ?What is a cynic??, to which Lord Darlington replies ?A ? man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing?.?
Cecil Graham then interjects ?And a sentimentalist, my dear Darlington, is a man who sees an absurd value in everything and does?nt know the market price of any single thing.? ?In a Sri Lankan political scenario, ?Mahinda Rajapaksa is a cynical realist who ?knows the price of everything? and Maithripala Sirisena a sentimentalist who saw ?an absurd value in everything?. Thus ?sentimental Maithripala was a virtual sitting duck when ?cynical Mahinda trained his guns on him.
Mahinda Rajapaksa realised that Maithripala Sirisena was in a state of denial about the true state of the ?SLFP and himself. During the campaign Maithripala had insisted that he was still the secretary of the party and would remain so.
Sirisena was also sensitively vulnerable to charges of having betrayed ?and broken the party, He was very keen that the SLFP should not fragment because of him. What Sirisena failed to realise was that the SLFP had fractured as soon as he crossed over with a handful of loyalists. Much water had flown under the bridge thereafter. Yet Maithripala continued to labour under the sentiment driven illusion that the SLFP ?egg could be made whole again after cracking it and making an omelette out of the yolks.Maithripala?s Mindset
Assessing Maithripala?s mindset correctly, Mahinda made the president an ?offer that he could not refuse. ?The leadership of the SLFP and by extension the chairmanship of the UPFA ?was offered to him on a platter. The icing on the cake was presenting Maithripala a potential ?opportunity to prevent the break-up of the ?SLFP. Here was a man whom the nation had elected democratically as head of the country to ?genuinely unify it. This was a noble responsibility Yet the president laid greater value at that juncture in being head of a political party and preserve its unity.?
Had ?Mahinda not ceded that ?space? to Maithripala there may have been a political tussle leading to a legal wrangle. While the party constitution enabled the elected ?president to be leader of the party there was also a condition that the ?person be elected from the party or a party led alliance. If there was open confrontation over party leadership the SLFP would certainly have been torn apart with the greater part opting to support Rajapaksa. Hence President Sirisena grasped the rose plant offered with all its nestles. Some of Sirisena?s acolytes ?doubling up as political commentators while holding ?patronage posts? described this SLFP takeover by Sirisena as a ?rout of Rajapaksa. This was not what had happened but Sirisena was ?lulled into triumphant mode by the ?sycophantic ?Jayawewa kattiya?.
Wrapped in a sentimental haze, President Sirisena failed to take note of ?a ?basic truth. ?Maithripala ?had gone against the SLFP ?and won with the support of other parties. His victory was made possible by the UNP while his own party had worked against him. The elementary truth was that the SLFP as a party was ?inherently hostile to him. It was still under the control of Mahinda Rajapaksa.The party hierarchy was now seemingly co-operating with Sirisena only because Mahinda Rajapaksa had wanted so. Mahinda could pull the carpet from under Maithripala?s feet at any time he desired. The dice was loaded against Maithripala. Still he chose to roll the dice thinking he could assert his authority gradually over the SLFP.Ill-advised decision
?Pallewatte Gamaralalage Maithripala Yapa Sirisena?s ill advised decision to take over the reins of the SLFP ?was the first success notched up by Mahinda Rajapaksa in his political counter offensive. Ironically it was well disguised as a defeat for Rajapaksa and victory for Sirisena. The President reverting to the party he had deserted to contest as common presidential candidate irked the UNP. Sirisena?s ?political godmother Chandrika Kumaratunga was also annoyed. The cracks began to appear. Still the President?s ?hurrah boys? egged him on as Maithripala Sirisena embarked upon this colossal ?exercise in futility.
Having neutralised President Maithripala ?to some extent and ?also driven ?a wedge into the ranks of the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe Government through the act of ?conceding SLFP leadership, Mahinda Rajapaksa began ?opening another front. In military parlance Mahinda withdrew from the SLFP front and re-opened the UPFA front. It was a dazzling political drama of pretension ?often enacted by ?political leaders. They pretend to ?be ready to forego power by declaring their intention to resign or quit office. This is followed up by orchestrated demonstrations by supporters demanding that their leader should not resign or quit. The demonstrations ?have the appearance of being spontaneous. Finally with feigned reluctance the great leader bows down to the wishes of the people and revises his earlier stance.
Mahinda Rajapaksa too followed this time tested path but with his own type of spin. He had quit Presidential office even before the full result was announced. He had now given up his claim to party leadership. The image he sought to project was that of Mahinda Rajapaksa ?not ?being a power hungry person. Mahinda ?now retired to his residences in Medamulana and Tangalle and began entertaining daily visitors arriving in bus loads. ?Mahinda also went around ?the country paying homage at Buddhist places of worship. He interacted with the media briefly on such occasions. The image portrayed was that of a king going into hermitage. Having given up his ?party leadership willingly Rajapaksa ?was now seeking a quiet life of retirement and religious contemplation.Bring Back Mahinda Movement
This ?appearance of withdrawal from active politics was ?a deceptive facade. As stated before, ?the UPFA ?political front had been opened. Four trusted ?captains from constituent parties in the UPFA were entrusted the task of launching and promoting a ?Bring Back Mahinda? movement. They were Dinesh Gunewardena, Vasudeva Nanayakkara, Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammanpila. This famous four of three parliamentarians and one provincial councillor were the prime movers and shakers who organized the first ?Bring Back Mahinda? rally at Nugegoda. It was a roaring success. Romesh Thapar ?who ?edited the Indian journal ?Seminar?once ?quipped that India?s contribution to modern democracy was the phenomenon of ??contrived crowds?. There was no doubt that a significant portion of the crowds at Nugegoda was transported to the venue. At the same time there is no denying that ?very large numbers had attended the rally voluntarily. What Rajapaksa?s detractors fail to realise is that notwithstanding all his defects and faults, Mahinda from Medamulana is the single most popular mass figure in Sri Lankan politics today.
Like evangelical rallies where there is whipped up devotional fervour, there was much orchestrated frenzy ?at the Mahinda movement rally too. Mahinda himself did not make an appearance but his message was read out to the nation by academic cum ex-diplomat Dayan Jayatilleka in an emotional ?performance before which the ?Mark Antony oration ?in ?Shakespeare?s ?Julius Caesar? paled into insignificance.
The Nugegoda rally succeeded in ?shocking and awing? the nation. By a well executed demonstration at Nugegoda, Mahinda Rajapaksa was able to prove that he was not a spent force and that he was a force to be reckoned with yet. The Nugegoda rally was followed by a series of ?Bring Back Mahinda? demonstrations in different parts of the country. The intention was to show that the people were clamouring for a return of Mahinda Rajapaksa to the political helm.?Bringing back Mahinda to ?Temple Trees? was the new manthra.?

<U+200B>MR promises new-look Lanka under new UPFA govt.
	
	Former President and UPFA Kurunegala district candidate Mahinda Rajapaksa today said he came before the people after the January 8 electoral defeat as a new leader and promised to turn Sri Lanka into a new country after a UPFA government is formed after the August 17 general election.
	Addressing the inaugural election propaganda rally at the Anuradhapura public ground he said a new set of leaders would also be created in the UPFA and the new government would develop new international relations while promoting inter communal harmony among Sinhalese, Muslims, Tamils and Burghers.
	?There will be new policies, new thinking and new work programmes, A new UPFA government would start probing PRA which was active in the 1989/90 insurgency and Batalanda. Bursaries of under graduates will be increased and University intakes will also be increased,? he stressed,
	"They called me a thief for protecting the country from the most powerful and cruelest terrorists and constructing airports and for giving employment to 1.5 million in the public sector. They branded me as a fraudster for launching hundreds of development projects round the country," he said.
	Mr. Rajapaksa alleged Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe could not tell the difference of a seer fish from a tuna, but he could easily identify a Parawa from a thora fish.
	Mr. Rajapakasa said he never bowed down to foreign influence and therefore the foreign countries colluded with the UNP to defeat his government.
	Mr. Rajapaksa said he never expected a public demand like the one that urged him to come back from his retirement after the Presidential poll in January and that was why he decided to re-enter politics from retirement. From the very first day he was visited by people from many walks of life from many parts of the country and expressed their solidarity and support to him,
	He added that the people in Rajarata lived in constant fear and dead bodies of soldiers were brought to the villages from the war zone daily,
	Mr, Rajapaksa assured that there would be a totally new UPFA government, new leaders and new policies after a UPFA victory on August 17.
	UPFA Leaders Nimal Siripala De Silva, Susil Premajayantha, Anura Priyadharshana Yapa, Wimal Weerawansa, Dinesh Gunawardana and Prof. Tissa Witharana also spoke. (Sandun A. Jayasekera)

Permission to transfer weapons to another vessel
	
A request made by the Ceylon Shipping Company to transfer the stock of weapons from the controversial floating armoury belonging to the Avant Garde company into another ship was granted today by Galle Chief Magistrate Nilupuli Lankatilleka.
The Magistrate made this order after the CID informed court that the Attorney General did not have any objection the the shipping company?s request.
The shipping company had earlier informed court that the ship which was very old could develop an oil leak causing environmental damage or some other environmental danger and that its insurance cover had also expired and on this basis had requested a court order to transfer the armory into another ship.
Meanwhile, lawyers appearing for the Avant Garde shipping company told Court that the Attorney General had informed the CID that he would not file action against the Avant Garde shipping company under the Firearms Ordinance, the Explosives Ordinance and the Prevention of Terrorism Act.
The CID confirmed what the AG had said and told Court it was conducting further investigations.
The Magistrate directed the CID to file the written advice received from the AG in court on the request made by the Avant Garde shipping company.
The case was postponed for August 27.
President?s Counsel Kuwera De Soysa, Attorneys Asoka Weerasuriya and Dulinda Weerasuriya appeared for the Avant Garde Company while President?s Counsel Razeek Zarook with A.P.G. Sarathchndra appeared for the Ceylon Shipping Company.

The Thera also said the Elections Commissioner was a good Public Servant who performed his duties impartially.
All should unite and work together, without party differences, for the development of the country, the thera said.
The deputy minister informed the Mahanayaka Thera that certain Buddhist monks had arranged to sign a petition to oust the President from the leadership of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. However, the Mahanayaka Thera said this was unlikely to happen. (J.A.L. Jayasinghe)

Ven. Sumangala thera expressed these views when former MP Prof. G.L. Peiris visited him at the temple.
?The Thera said it was the racial political parties that instigate racism in the country and pointed out that the political parties should be able to represent all the people from every religion and community.
??Everyone is speaking about national reconciliation today. It should start from Parliament. We cannot ensure national reconciliation without banning racial political parties. Our main political parties represent every religion and community but what has happened today by setting up political parties based on racial differences. This severely affects country?s reconciliation and development,? the thera said.(Kanchana Kumara Ariyadasa)

UNP defends restraining order on COPE report
	
The United National Party (UNP) today defended the court order restraining the publication of the report by the parliamentary Committee On Public Enterprises (COPE) on the sale of Central Bank bonds saying the report was not an official document.
Kandy District UNP Candidate and Minister Lakshman Kiriella and Colombo District UNP Candidate Rosy Senanayake told a media briefing that COPE had never issued an official report.
Mr. Kiriella questioned as to why the report was not presented in parliament on June 26 even though the matter was listed in the order paper. He said the Supreme Court had already given a verdict on the bond issue and acquitted those said to have been involved, as such nobody could challenge or raise this matter any more.
Ms. Senanayake said the report which some UPFA members had come up with was not an official COPE document because it had not been signed by any of the members of the COPE sub-committee. She said a copy was sent to her at 11.00 pm the day before it was to be presented in parliament.
Ms. Senanayake said the members of the new COPE committee which would be set up by the new parliament would continue the investigation on the bond issue.
She said Perpetual Treasuries would be dealt with if found guilty of any fraud with regard to the bond issue and added that former Central Bank Governor Nivard Cabraal's sister had also been a director of this company. (Yohan Perera)
