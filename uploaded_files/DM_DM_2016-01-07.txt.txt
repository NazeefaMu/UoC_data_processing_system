	The anticipated Cabinet reshuffle is likely to not take place as President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had decided to put it off.
	Informed sources said this decision was made by the duo after a discussion. The two leaders are of the opinion that the opposition will get political mileage out of a cabinet reshuffle if it frustrates some Ministers.
	However, it is expected that some joint Opposition members who are likely to cross over to the government will be given cabinet port folios soon. It was previously reported that Opposition MP Geetha Kumaraisnghe would be appointed as the Chairperson of the Galle District Development Committee after her anticipated cross over to the government.

Global sovereign rating downgrades likely to outpace upgrades in 2016: report
	
		 		 
		 
			
Sovereign downgrades are likely to outpace upgrades in 2016, says Standard & Poors Ratings Services in the report: Global Sovereign Rating Trends 2016.
Among the 131 sovereigns it rates globally, 25 had negative outlooks versus eight positive outlooks on December 31, 2015, a ratio of three to one.
The outlook balance--positive minus negative outlooks--has dropped to -17 from the seven-year high of -4 in June 2015, said Standard & Poors Chief Rating Officer for Sovereign Ratings Moritz Kraemer.
This constitutes the most negative six-monthly swing in the outlook balance since December 2008.
This outlook distribution suggests that negative rating actions are likely to continue to outnumber positive actions over the coming 12 months. And it also indicates that the dominance of downgrades is likely to accelerate this year compared to last.
Negative outlooks have outnumbered positive outlooks since early 2008. However, the second half of 2015 has seen a reversal of the gradually improving trend in the outlook balance that had begun in 2013. Over the past year, the outlook balance has deteriorated in all global regions except Asia-Pacific, which continues to have a rare positive balance of +1 (with positive outlooks in Indonesia and Pakistan outnumbering the negative one of Papua New Guinea).
The deterioration was most pronounced in the Middle East, Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and Africa, where the negative balance doubled to -12, an all-time regional low. Latin America and the Caribbean (to -4 from -2) have seen a more moderate deterioration during 2015, as has Europe (to -2 from zero).
Global sovereign creditworthiness has declined slightly since the onset of the global financial crisis in 2008. The average long-term sovereign credit rating has fallen by just over one notch to between BBB- and BBB, compared with just below BBB+ in 2008.
The average rating as weighted by countries gross domestic product (GDP) has also trended downward, although it has been slightly more stable, currently standing marginally above A+. This is comparable with sovereign ratings in 2005, but is slightly lower than the AA- peak in mid-2008.

	The government will discuss with the United States (US) in joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) with that country during the next round of talks on Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA), a Deputy Minister said yesterday.
	TPP is said to be the largest trade agreement accounting to 40 per cent of world trade.
	Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva told Daily Mirror that the US would focus on signing this agreement with 12 countries once the Congress ratified it.
	Canada, Mexico, Chile, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei, Vietnam, the United States, Peru and Japan are the 12 countries to join TPP at the moment.
	It is a comprehensive and broad arrangement that opens trade, services and investments, and it will be of immense benefit for Sri Lanka to join it, and the US is basically looking at it, the Deputy Minister said.
	He pointed out that the government would have talks on TIFA within the next few weeks in Colombo, and at that time, attention would be paid on modalities of joining TPP.
	We will place TPP in the TIFA agenda, he mentioned. (Kelum Bandara)

	National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader Wimal Weerawansa said yesterday that MP Hirunika Premachandra should have been arrested already over the Dematagoda abduction if the independent police commission was genuinely independent.
	MP Premachandra has still not been arrested and this proves that the police commission is not really independent. The government established these commissions to act without government or any other influence. But it seems that the word independent holds no value as assured by the government, he told a news conference at the Dr. N.M. Perera Centre in Colombo.
	Meanwhile, he mentioned that the reins of the government were not in the hands of either President Maithripala Sirisena or Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, but in the US, India and LTTE Diaspora.
	He pointed out that it was a requirement of these external elements which had made the government to introduce a new Constitution.
	None of our citizens had asked for a new Constitution. The Diaspora wants it to decentralize the power of the State and execute their sinister agenda in the North and East, to merge them, he said.
	He requested people to raise their objection against the government to rectify the mistake they had made an year ago. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) said today it would not allow terrorism to raise its head again or allow clauses in the Constitution concerning the unitary state and giving priority to Buddhism be amended.
Only a PSC will be appointed on January 9 to seek opinions on introducing constitutional reforms to the present Constitution which gives priority to amend the election system. We will not allow any changes to the unitary state or giving priority to Buddhism which will need referendum to do so, JHU General Secretary and Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
Commenting on the rumours that a new constitution would be brought without the unitary state and priority to Buddhism on January 9, Minister Ranawaka said that no new Constitution or Draft Bill would be brought on that day but only a Parliamentary Select Committee (PSC) to seek opinions on introducing constitutional reforms would be appointed.
He said certain racist groups in the South were trying to spread rumours that separatism and terrorism was raising its head again while Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneshwaran was also trying to give life to the separatism.
Even though some racist groups were spreading rumours about terrorism raising its head again, there is no such thing happening in the country. Such racist groups have no place in society now, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

	The Principal, of Kingswood College in Kandy, has been interdicted on charges of violating Education Ministry circulars by collecting Rs.3.6 million from parents saying it was for the purpose of constructing a new building for the school, the Education Ministry said today.
	This matter came to light on the basis of an audit carried out on the instructions of the Education Ministry Secretary. The Principal had allegedly collected Rs.3,625,000 from parents when admitting their children to Grade 1.
	The Education Ministry said it was in the process of granting the school Rs.70 million for the construction of a four-storey building, but by then the principal had allegedly collected the funds from the parents.
	According to the audit the Principal had obtained Rs.50,000 each from 65 parents, while another parent was asked to pay Rs.75,000, with two others having paid Rs.150,000 each.
	The ministry said collecting money from parents in such a manner, for an school building, not included in the schools budget estimates for 2016, had violated four of its circulars.
	The statement also said that there were several other schools where similar violations had taken place, and that ministry officials had been instructed by Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam to take action regardless of the status or popularity of the school. The Minister had also instructed the officials to take steps to return the funds collected to the parents. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Sooriyabandara in the presence of CMA Director Operations Sumudu Pagoda, Director Examination Dr. Swineetha De Livera and Consultant Examination L.B. Wattegedara
Two more prominent commercial organisations have joined hands with Certified Management Accountants (CMA) Sri Lanka in its efforts to produce management accountants who are skilled and well-trained in their valued profession.
One organisation is MAS Intimates (Pvt.) Ltd, a subsidiary of MAS Holdings (Pvt.) Ltd in Sri Lanka, and is the design, development and marketing arm for the various intimate wear facilities falling under this venture with customers such as Victorias Secret, Lululemon, Marks & Spencer, Athleta, La Senza, DIM Branded Apparel, Soma, Calvin Klein, Oysho and H&M.
The other organisation is Polycrome (Pvt.) Ltd. Polycrome has started its business in the year 1984 and since then it has been growing steadily with a vision of providing high-quality electrical accessories to illuminate the future generations of Sri Lanka. Both organisations possess highly-qualified staff strength. 
Professor Lakshman Watawala signed the agreements on behalf of CMA and relevant officials of the two partners corroborated. Subsequently, the certificates of accreditation were presented to the partners in the presence of high-ranking staff of the parties to agreements. 
Why does CMA need training partners
There is surely more than one reason. The most important among them is the compulsory practical training requirement for the CMA membership. CMA takes all measures to ensure its accountants/members are well-versed in all aspects of management accounting by the time they enter the profession. Therefore, three years of practical training in an accounting and financial environment is mandatory to obtain the CMA membership in addition to completing all examinations, including the Integrative Case Study, successfully. 
Mandatory training needs to be undergone in an institution or company that satisfies the criteria stipulated by CMA Sri Lanka. As employers of all students may not be of required standards, in order to overcome possible quality issues in practical training, CMA has initiated the Training Partnership Agreement (TPA) programme.
Training Partnership Agreement
TPAs are signed with commercial and other institutions of repute that have capacity for training and qualified staff that could provide proper guidance to trainees. Following the agreements, the TPA partner companies inform CMA Sri Lanka whenever opportunities of training arise in their organisations.
CMA students, who have expressed their interest in finding training placements, will be directed to such opportunities by CMA Sri Lanka. CMA is monitoring the progress made by trainees by keeping constant touch with Training Partner Companies and through record books maintained by the trainees. 
Although the TPA programme was in operation for just over three years, the number of TPAs entered into reached 120 with the latest additions of Polycrome and MAS Intimates. Some of the other TPA partners are the John Keels group, Commercial Bank, National Development Bank, Sampath Bank, Bartleet, Arpico Finance, Richard Pieris, Delmege Forsyth, Commercial Credit, the Browns group, Fonterra, AMW, Citizen Development Bank, L B Finance, Ceylon Grain Elevators, Maliban Biscuits, Lanka Puthra Development Bank and DIMO.
Demand for trainees
Responses from TPA partners indicate that they prefer to engage CMA trainees in their companies owing to the fact that CMA students possess broader knowledge in accounting instilled in them by well-qualified lecturers through internationally-accepted curriculum. Many instances, where the companies have absorbed trainees into their permanent cadre before the end of the training period, have been reported.  
Entry to job market
Lack of work experience is the main hurdle that stands between the youth and employment in the current job market context. Even university graduates are rejected by employers due to the absence of job training to complement qualifications. So, even under circumstances where it is not compulsory, practical training could be the passport to employment. Through the TPA programme, CMA Sri Lanka ensures that those who qualify with CMA will never lack hands-on experience on their profession.
The practical training would provide the good grounding on how to put theories learnt in classroom to best practice. In addition, training in a recognized company will expose students to the formal work environment, give them personal confidence and credibility to their training. They will also have the opportunity to develop contacts that might prove useful in the future.
Students are assured of a job after completion of the practical training and passing the CMA exams. They are instilled with integrity, code of ethics, good governance, professional competence and ready to enter the commercial field and make a significant contribution to the growth of the economy.

New gifts for new year from Seylan Tikiri
	
		 		 
		 
			
The first month of the academic year is always exciting for children where they expect new books, uniforms and most importantly attractive stationery. We are delighted to mark the beginning of 2016 for the kids with an exciting incentive scheme that will both promote the habit of savings and help make classroom activities exhilarating and colourful, said Seylan Bank Deputy General Manager Marketing and Personal Banking Tilan Wijeyesekera
Due to the popular response received last year, we have extended this promotion from pre-school kids to grade five students. Seylan Tikiri, the countrys premier minor savings account, has always gone that extra mile to appreciate the loyalty and partnership we enjoy with kids and their parents through various reward schemes, he added.
For the second consecutive year, Seylan Tikiri, the flagship brand of Seylan Bank, is geared to provide a cheerful start for the children for the new academic year. With the objective of fulfilling kids dreams for a fresh start in the new academic year, Seylan Tikiri has planned to offer them stimulating incentives for their studies. Vis--vis last years promotion, which was limited only for preschools and Grade One students, this years gift scheme is extended to children up to Grade Five.
The promotion will commence from January 1, 2016 across all Seylan Bank branches islandwide. Every new Tikiri account opened or new deposit with Rs.1,500 will be entitled for a free pencil case and every new Tikiri account opened or new deposit with Rs.3,500 will be entitled for a free student bag. With this incentive scheme, Seylan is also encouraging parents to commence lifelong savings plans for their kids.
Seylan Banks minor savings scheme, Seylan Tikiri, has a history spanning 28 years and is one of the most sought-after childrens savings accounts in Sri Lanka. Seylan Tikiri is renowned for being closely connected with its customers and consistently engages with them through various exciting value-adding activities by providing the best benefits to their young customers. While encouraging the savings habit from a tender age, the bank rewards the child depositors with novel and innovative gifts ranging from mugs, school bags, video game pads, remote-controlled helicopters, organs, bicycles, DVD setups, tabs, to LED TVs.
Recently Tikiri has added a scooter to its gift portfolio. The success of Seylan Tikiri is attributed to its fast response to changing market trends and needs of their customers. Seylan Banks belief is, if children get involved in banking practices from their early childhood, they will learn about finance, fund management and practice savings throughout their adult lives. 
Seylan Bank, the bank with a heart, identified as one of the six systemically important banks in Sri Lanka by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, has expanded its network to 159 branches and more than 181 ATMs, exclusive of its student saving centres, islandwide. Understanding the needs of their valuable customers, Seylan has continuously provided with innovative value additions to its products and services.

Pan Asia Bank launches Blue Chip Money  Market Savings product for corporates
	
		 		 
		 
			
Sri Lankas fastest growing commercial bank, Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC, recently launched its newest savings account designed for the corporate clientele to park their excess funds while enjoying one of the highest interest rates on offer in the market.  
Pan Asia Banks Blue Chip Money Market Savings Account offers any corporate in the country to send its excess moneys to Pan Asia Bank and earn an interest rate of 6.25 percent per annum in the current context (rates are subject to change weekly) and offer the flexibility to remit its monies back with interest even on the very next day. 
Besides, this account also offers the ability for a company to operate the account combined with a current account with an inbuilt sweep-in, sweep-out facility, where automatic fund transfer between the savings account and current account are made possible.
At a time when such investment opportunities are extremely rare for the corporate in Sri Lanka, Pan Asia Banks Blue Chip Money Market Savings Account offers an ideal opportunity for the Lankan businesses to earn an extra return on their money, which otherwise would have been idling in their current accounts.
Explaining the reasons for coming up with a savings product for the corporate clients, the banks Deputy General Manager (DGM) Treasury Richie Dias said although there are many savings products in the market offering higher interest rates for the retail customers, there are not many products that cater exclusively to meet the requirements of corporate clients.
This is an ideal opportunity for companies that operate with excess liquidity to earn an extra income by transferring funds to us as an enhanced interest rate returns can be obtained as opposed to keeping money in a current account. Since Blue Chip Money Market Savings Account offers tiered bases interest rates, higher the amount invested, the higher the rate of return would be for the customer, Dias said. 
Above 6 percent
savings interest rate
Another notable feature in the account is that the interest rate offered is fixed for a week, based on the prevailing inter-bank money market interest rates.
Every Monday, the bank advertises the interest rate on the press so that those companies which intend to invest in the account are able to know in advance the rate which will be applicable on their funds. Investments can be made for periods as short as a single day and then get the funds transferred back. 
The bank will also soon start an e-mail campaign to all companies communicating the interest rates offered on the account. 
A company that maintains a balance between Rs.5 million and Rs.25 million in the account will earn a minimum interest rate of 6.25 percent, while a balance exceeding Rs.25 million will earn an interest rate over 6.50 percent (There are current interest rates. Rates are subject to change weekly).
The bank will calculate the interest on the daily balance and credit to their account on a monthly basis.
There are many occasions where companies find themselves in cash rich positions due to the seasonality of their working capital cycle or sudden realization of their stocks. So, until they start their next working capital cycle, these moneys wont earn any income if they just lie idle in a current account. That is why the Blue Chip Money Market Savings Account is an ideal solution for such companies that look to optimize returns on their funds, he remarked.
Sweep-in, sweep-out facility 
The inbuilt sweep-in, sweep-out facility in the account enables the bank to transfer funds between the savings account and the current account of the company without having to give instructions each and every time such a transfer is required.
We take care of the management of the funds on behalf of the company. For instance, if you receive a cheque to your current account, the funds will automatically be transferred to the current account from the Blue Chip Money Market Savings Account and at the end of the day the entire collection of your current account will be transferred back to the Blue Chip Money Market Savings Account for which you will earn an interest income, Dias added.
The bank will soon launch its state-of-the-art Internet banking platform and the mobile app, which will bring the operating and the monitoring of the account to the companys accountants or the owners fingertips.
Any corporate entity registered in Sri Lanka can open an account at any of Pan Asia Banks 79 branches scattered across the country to enjoy these hassle-free benefits while enjoying the highest interest rate available for a corporate savings deposit.
Understanding Sri Lankan corporate clientele
The product was designed after closer understanding of the requirements of the corporate clientele of the country. 
This is in line with our banks ethos of understanding the customer better than anyone else. We have successfully done this in our retail banking segment and we are now testing our strengths in the corporate banking segment. Since the launch of the product recently, we have received an extremely positive response from the market, Dias said.
Pan Asia Bank has been at the forefront of introducing innovative value-added products to the market due to its commitment to understand real customer requirements.
In 2014, the bank was adjudged as the most innovative bank in Sri Lanka by the United Kingdoms Global Banking and Finance Review, while in 2015, Pan Asia Bank was ranked among the top three banks in Sri Lanka at the coveted National Business Excellence Awards organised by the National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka.

SL to be made a global mega city: PM
	
	Sri Lanka will be developed into a global city that will go between Dubai and Singapore where international trade and movement is concerned, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.
	Speaking at the Sri Lanka Economic Forum 2016 in Colombo, the Prime Minister said the time had come to make plans to fulfil this objective.
	Our objective is to make Sri Lanka the most competitive nation in the Indian Ocean and to develop the island as a mega city for the region that will go between Singapore and Dubai thus make it competitive and the time has come for us to think how we are going to do it, he said.
	He also stressed the need for economical links between Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu and also with other Indian states such as Gujarat.
	Sri Lanka is the first nation in South Asia to embrace open economy, first in Asia to go for free education and one of the first nations in the region to enjoy universal franchise,  the Premier recalled while stressing that the country should move forward from being a low income earning country.  We cant continue as a low income country and should decide how we could go ahead, he said.
	He indicated that Sri Lanka would have to take stock of the global economic situation and its own shortcomings and opportunities and would convert the economy into a manufacturing based one. Further he said the country will have to look at agriculture and modernize the sector. Sri Lanka did focus on agriculture in the past when it launched the Mahaweli Development but unfortunately it was not possible to go forward from there, he said.(Yohan Perera)
