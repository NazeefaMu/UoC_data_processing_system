Banks? asset quality to wane in 2016, but not a major concern: report
	
The rise in interest rates and the resulting slowdown in the economy could increase the banking sector bad loans marginally but will not be a major concern for the sector stability, according to a banking sector report by a Colombo-based?
stock brokerage.
?With interest rates on the rise and economic activity slowing down (forecast GDP growth of 5.1 percent for 2016) we might see a marginal increase in NPL, however it would not be a major concern,? said Softlogic Stockbrokers (Private) Limited in a sector note issued last week.?
Sri Lanka?s banking sector asset quality improved through 2014 and 2015 as the sector gross non-performing loan (NPL) ratio declined to 4.2 percent by end-September 2015, the Central Bank data showed.?
However, it is a common phenomenon for NPLs to go up when the interest rates increase as the floating rate borrowers find tough to service their loans amid falling real incomes.?
In a similar situation when the Sri Lankan authorities raised interest rates in 2012 to arrest an overheated economy due to cheap bank credit, the banking sector NPLs reached a peak of 5.6 percent in 2013 (see illustration).?
Softlogic?s analysis however observed the two state banks ? Bank of Ceylon and People?s Bank ? recording an increase in their NPLs as of September 30, 2015, while the others recording an improvement.?
Bank of Ceylon?s gross NPL ratio rose to 4.3 percent from 3.8 percent a year ago while People?s Bank?s NPL ratio edged up to 3.3 percent from 3.2 percent a?
year ago.?
Both banks have a greater exposure to government and state-owned enterprise sector of their assets.?
Meanwhile, the stockbrokerage believes the banks would sustain net interest margins (NIM) in the first quarter in 2016 at the current levels before seeing an increase from the second quarter onwards.
The latest Central Bank data up to the September quarter of 2015 show an average NIM of 3.6 percent.?
Since the beginning of the year, the banks have been re-pricing both its loans and deposits upwards in response to the hike in reserve requirement and the subsequent increase in key policy rates, which created a liquidity crunch in?
the market. ??

Jayanthi and Johann said they had received enormous support from friends and others, some of whom were even unknown to them, for their giant step, which will take Sri Lanka?s flag into the International arena.
In an interview with Daily Mirror Online, Jayanthi, who is a leading women?s rights activist and gender expert, invited all the Sri Lankan women to empower themselves and come forward to take up challenges of this nature.
Johann, a renowned hair stylist and fashion designer, said they took up this challenge to not only fulfill their dream, but to also make Sri Lanka known throughout the world.
Climbing Everest, the world highest mountain is an experience full of thrills and risks.

I was right to defend SL?s human rights record: Abbott
	
Former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott has defended his decision not to join the ?human rights lobby against the tough but probably unavoidable actions taken to end one of the world?s most vicious civil wars which took place in Sri Lanka?, the Australian reported on Monday.
The United Nations has been pushing for an investigation into allegations that up to 40,000 Tamils were killed by Sri Lankan government troops in the final months of fighting in the civil war, which ended in 2009.
In a 3,700 word essay published over the weekend in Quadrant, Mr. Abbott wrote that he was sure former president Mahinda Rajapaksa would have been pleased if Australia did not join the chorus of international criticism.
Both countries became even stronger partners in the Abbott government?s most urgent initial task ? to end the people-smuggling trade and deaths at sea, he said.
Mr. Abbott acknowledged that his tough boat crackdown, Operation Sovereign Borders, could have foundered on numerous occasions.
Government lawyers had claimed that the operation was beyond power while some senior officials fretted about the consequences for Australia?s relationship with Indonesia.
?But the government simply had to stop the boats ? our national interest and our self-respect as a country demanded it,? he wrote.

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had failed to find solutions to the problems the country was facing, and that was why the former Government called for a Presidential Election two years before the predecessor?s term ended, President Maithripala Sirirsena said yesterday.
?The former President called for elections two years in advance because they were unable to deliver solutions to the problems the country was facing. People voted me in with the hope that I would deliver what I promised,? he said in an interview last night.
He said Sri Lanka, which had been one of the most isolated nations internationally in the past, was now transformed into a country accepted worldwide with many powerful friends.

There was nothing wrong in increasing the allowances given to Members of Parliament, Minister of Primary Industries Daya Gamage has said.
Addressing a gathering in Ampara recently, the Minister said an MP currently gets an allowance of Rs. 50,000 and it was hardly sufficient to meet the expenses as an MP.
?I too get an allowance, even for fuel, but I have told Parliament authorities, to credit all my allowances to the account of Daya Sarana Trust. Even Ms. Anoma Gamage?s allowances go for the trust through which we help needy children and engage in various other social and charity works,? the Minister said.
?I can afford to live without an increment as I am wealthy, but not all MPs are wealthy and they need funds for their activities and they have to spend some money even to attend Parliament sessions,? he added. (Yohan Perera)

The Megapolis and Western Development Ministry was not behind Sunday night?s removal of the walking track at Mabola in Wattala, Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said today.
He said the walking track was not constructed by his ministry and hoped that those who removed it would take measures to rebuild it.
?The media reported on Sunday about the removal of a walking track in Mabola. This was not constructed by our ministry or maintained by us. The track has been abandoned in the recent past and we only renovated it,? the minster told the gathering at the opening ceremony of the construction of the Kottawa Bus Terminal.
He said there was a request from the Lands Ministry to create a road along the canal by the walking track. Accordingly, the Land Reclamation and Development Corporation had responded saying there was no issue about building a road without hindering the opportunity to develop the canal in the future.
?We never said that the walking track should be destroyed,? he said.
He said he hoped those who removed the track would rebuild it and hand it over to the people. ?We request the media to report the truth without tarnishing the image of officials because these kinds of incidents happen in various places in the country,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
