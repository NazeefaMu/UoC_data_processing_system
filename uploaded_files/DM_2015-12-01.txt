Faulty part caused 2014 AirAsia crash; investigators
	
A fault with the rudder control system and crew actions were today blamed for the AirAsia jet crash that killed all 162 people on board in the Java Sea last year, Daily Mail reported today.
Indonesian investigators has said repeated problems with the computer system led to the pilots disengaging the autopilot in stormy weather in a bid to fix the situation and then losing control of the Airbus A320-200.
In their final report into the crash, investigators said the soldering on the Rudder Travel Limiter system  which helps control the rudder's movement  was cracked, leading it to send repeated warning systems to the pilots.
The solder joint had malfunctioned repeatedly, including four times during the flight and 23 times the previous year, the report found.
When the pilot's received the fourth warning, the pilots pulled circuit-breakers on part of the aircraft's control system in a bid to reset the system.
This turned off the autopilot, and the plane then started to roll, the report said.
'Subsequent flight crew action resulted in inability to control the aircraft,' said the report by Indonesia's official National Transportation Safety Committee.
The plane went into a 'prolonged stall condition that was beyond the capability of the crew to recover', it said.
It added the flight data recorders did not indicate the weather had affected the aircraft. 
The Airbus A320 aircraft crashed less than half-way into a two-hour flight from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore on December 28 last year.
Two months later, Indonesian divers found the body of the French co-pilot in the front part of the fuselage during a search operation.

Bank merger proposal dropped!
	
There is a bank launched by the previous regime for the sole purpose of uplifting the living of the poor in the country.
Quite recently a proposal that this bank be merged with the State-run savings bank came under the serious consideration of the yahapalanaya government.
The proposed merger highly ruffled the purohita presiding over the subject of bringing prosperity to the poor because the move meant the transfer to the savings bank a massive Rs.50 billion fund held by the uplifting-the-poor bank currently functioning under his purview.
The purohita lost no time in getting an appointment to see the yahapalanaya boss to protest against the proposed merger and the latter after giving an attentive ear to the flustered purohita agreed not to go ahead with it.
An elated purohita had gone laughing all the way back to his Ministry. However, another purohita had looked as if he had been slapped on the face when this news reached him.

Dambulla fixing; mystery deepens
	
	Daily Mirror has obtained an exclusive copy of a letter which was written by Sri Lanka Crickets then security consultant Major General Lawrence Fernando to the manager of the visiting Indian cricket team in 2010 which claims that not only had one player entertained a female guest for an entire night in his room, but another player had also entertained a male guest in his room for a night while staying at a hotel in Dambulla.
	Justice Mukul Mudgal, the Indian Supreme Court-appointed inquiry commissioner looking into allegations of fixing in Indian cricket, investigated into the incident at Dambulla after the Sunday Times of London named the player as Suresh Raina, who had entertained the woman in his room during the 2010 Asia Cup tournament.
	After the report in the London Sunday Times the Lankan board raised the matter with the BCCI, the Indian officials denied there was any such complaint and claimed that the woman was Raina`s agent.
	Subsequently, Raina`s then agent Bunty Sajdeh of Cornerstone Sports and Entertainment Private Limited (CSE) revealed that it was his cousin Ritika, a CSE employee, who was in Raina`s room and that she was there in connection with some of the batsman`s endorsements.
	However, the letter written by Fernando now shows that there had been another incident of a similar nature during the tournament.
	Fernando had warned Indian team manager Ranjib Biswal, for allowing two guests to stay with two different players in their rooms.
	On your request I informed the Ministerial Security Division officer who was in charge of the floor security of the Indian players room area to allow a female guest who was supposed to be a journalist to enter into an Indian Players room (name withheld) to interview him in the evening on 18th June 2010 at Kandalama Hotel, Dambulla. You were also informed that the female guest can be there in the players room only till 2000hrs for which you agreed, the letter (a copy exclusively obtained by us) written by Fernando to the then team manger, says.
	After 2000hrs. officer of the MSD had brought this to your notice time to time that the lady guest of the player has not left. After sometime you had left your phone unanswered without informing the female guest to leave and she had remained there till morning 19th June 2010.
	Further to that it was informed to me by MSD officer, that male guest of another player too was allowed by you to be accommodated in his room at Kandalama Hotel in the night of 18th June 2010 without informing me, Fernando said in his letter.
	These two incidents had already been intimated to the ICCs Anti Corruption and Security Unit by Fernando.
	Please note that if you continue to permit unauthorized activities without prior approval which may cause breach of security and for any unfortunate incident, Sri Lanka Cricket or the security establishments should not be held responsible, the letter said in its concluding remarks.

Faulted for bypassing party leader
	
There are several kinds of purohitas and from among them the State ones are an unhappy lot because the purohitas above them have failed to delegate powers and functions to them, they say.
One of these unhappy purohitas recently kicked up a row saying that his nominee for a post of director in one of the institutions under the Ministry had been ignored. He later sent a missive to the yahapalanaya boss complaining that the purohita above him had summarily rejected the list of nominees for high posts he had submitted.
The Big Boss sent no reply to this missive. However, during a visit to the Diyawanna House, he had sent for the unhappy State purohita.
Pulling this purohita up for sending him an unwarranted missive, the Big Boss warned him not to send complaints against other purohitas directly to him in the future bypassing his own party leader, they say.

The latest story churned out by the political rumour mill says that four opposition Diyawanna members are set to cross over to the Green party.
Three of the foursome are going to be double-crossers who once quit the green party vowing to strengthen the hands of the former strongman. One of them is from a family in Uva with original green roots. The second one is a young buck from the South. The third one from the hills failed in his first bid under yahapalanaya to cross the divide as the feelers he sent out drew no positive response.
The fourth crossover-to-be is a member from Sabaragamuwa. However, his name is a closely guarded secret, they say.

The war hero, after declining high office offered to him, accepted a top position in a private company.
A friend of the ex-security chief intrigued by the latters refusal to accept a high post coveted by many decided to get his reason for doing so from the horses mouth and the war hero gave him a ready explanation: We fought for several years to save this country, he said. But we had no peace after retirement. We were driven from pillar to post for questioning. Even if I served as a diplomat, one day I may have to face a similar situation. Therefore, I would rather live with peace of mind than wallow in the glory of a high post!

Janashakthi pioneers unique policy tailored for people with HIV
	
In a breakthrough move in the life insurance sector, Janashakthi Insurance has extended life cover to those diagnosed with HIV.
This is a unique new policy that will change the lives of many people and give them peace of mind. Over 3300 people were living with HIV by the end of 2014, according to estimated data from the National STD/AIDS Control programme.
In the life insurance industry there is a common practice called HIV exclusion. This means that all claims arising directly or indirectly from a policy holders HIV will not be covered. Janashakthi is the only insurer who does not have this exclusion in their life policies for Basic Life cover from its day one of operation. As another first, with this initiative Janashakthi will become the only insurance company which will offer Life Assurance to people living with HIV, said founder of Janashakthi Insurance, Chandra Schaffter, who is widely credited as being the father of insurance.
Janashakthi made this announcement to coincide with World Aids Day which is an opportunity for people worldwide to fight against HIV, show their support for people living with HIV and commemorate those who have died.
This policy will encourage people to seek early treatment and make sure they continue treatment. The policy is linked to the patients CD4 count  a blood test that indicates how well the immune system is working. This will help people living with HIV to live a longer, near normal life and it will also reduce the spread of HIV from and infected person to another said Dr. Indira Hettiarachchi, former National HIV/AIDS Programme Coordinator for the International Labour Organization, which initiated advocacy with the insurance sector of Sri Lanka to improve social security for people living with HIV.
Janashakthi has historically been an innovator, acting as a pioneer in the insurance sector. These include Life Unlimited, a unique policy allowing for lifetime hospitalization cover with just a 20 year premium, Jeevitha Thilina, a gift insurance policy which allows grandparents to gift their grandchildren with insurance policies and LifeSaver, a flexible plan which provides a secure pension for a policyholder and their spouse for their entire lifetime upon retirement. Apart from providing cover to those suffering with HIV, Janashakthi was also the first to provide coverage for soldiers during the war.

But, going by the new developments, getting his active involvement any longer looks like a dim prospect, a member from Galle area vouchsafed. Why the others asked in unison. Because the former boss has already decided to step aside to make way for the new boss to run the show! he replied. 

Why cant we make a try to bring the two together After all, they are old friends. In politics, we all have to let bygones be bygones! This suggestion came from a member from Wayamba well known for his political match-making skills. There was a time when we could have brought them together, the member from the Colombo area replied.

	A countrywide private bus strike will be launch form December 14 midnight over several demands including that of the removal of Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, All Ceylon Private Bus Association (ACPBA) Secretary Anjana Priyanjith said today.
	At a joint media conference attended by the Inter Provincial Bus Owners Association, Southern Provincial Bus Owners Association and the ACPBA, Mr. Priyanjith said the private bus operators would give a seven-day grace period for the minister to discuss this matter with the ACPBA and to provide a favorable reply.
	We expect some positive answers from the government within this period, if not we will hoist black flags on buses on the seventh day to educate the people about the ministers failure to resolve our concerns, he said. If the Minister is unable to meet us, we will give another seven-day grace period before launching a countrywide token bus strike calling for the removal of the minister.
	Mr. Priyanjith said our demands include the removal of the new vehicle emission test fee of Rs.5000; the removal of new 2 per cent tax on the buses; a reduction on the price of diesel and reduce the tax of Rs.150 to Rs.100 on a seat in a vehicle registered under the motor coach.
	If the government fails to grant our demands we will impose a bus-fare hike in the near future we will have to protect our industry by collecting money from the commuters even reluctantly, he added. No one from the previous and the present government care about private buses, nothing had been mentioned about the industry even in the 2016 Budget, Mr. Priyanjith said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Some light on the Rithu Akarsha mishap
	
Rithu Akarsha the tele actress who shot to fame in a short time, also hit news headlines recently.Akarsha had a nasty experience the other day, when she was returning home in Kelaniya after an exhausting filming session.
The vehicle she had been driving had crashed onto a barrier at a check point at the entrance of the road leading to the parliamentary complex.Although the vehicle was damaged she escaped injuries and had managed to drive away without stopping.
The police personnel who were on guard duty at the barrier had chased behind Akarshas car and found that the young good looking but badly shaken driver was Rithu Akarsha the popular tele-actress. As the law was applicable to all irrespective of their positions and personalities, police obtained a statement from her on the instructions of the Talangama police ASP Sarath Prema. Akarsha related that she had been returning from Polduwa after taking part in the shooting of a tele-drama. She had been accompanied by one of her friends and after dropping her at Thalawathugoda the actress had headed homewards but had found difficulty in locating the correct road home when the mishap took place. Akarsha and her car were taken into custody by the police and she was produced before the Kaduwela Magistrates Courts.
Police Sergeant Sumanadasa submitted to courts that on the night of 22nd at about 11 PM Akarsha driving her car in a reckless manner had crashed into the police barrier near the entrance to the parliamentary complex. The defendant was released on a surety bail of Rs 100,000 by the Kaduwela Magistrate and Additional District Judge Dammika Hemapala. Attorney Kamal Wijesiri appeared for Akarsha. The police had acted commendably despite Akarshas popularity as an actress and her father being a police officer. Many rumours and gossip began spreading that Rithu Akarsha while returning from a night club had been under the influence of liquor when the accident took place.
Refuting all these allegations Akarsha said: All these days I had to work day and night due to continual shooting of a tele-dramas. On the day of this misfortune the shooting in the Rajagiriya area went on until very late. When it was over I decided to return home when a colleague requested for a lift to her home in Thalawathugoda area. After dropping her, I continued on my journey. I remember passing the Waters Edge Hotel before I knocked against the plastic cones and the barrier at the police barrier and stopped. One of the police officers at the barrier knew my father who was also a police officer. The police accompanied me to the Thalangama police. The damaged car too brought to the police station.
 She vehemently denied that she spoke to a young Cabinet minister soon after the accident, but to her father. My father never influenced the police to release me and I never pleaded for his help. I did not flee from the place of the accident which directly involved me either. As I cooperated with the police they took action to produce me in courts without delay. 
When asked whether she was under the influence of liquor when the accident took place, she scoffed at the very idea. If I were drunk at that time, police would have definitely found out about it. I am not a drinker, but the media picked on me to spread this story, she claimed. I told them the truth as I had nothing to hide. It was tiring and exhaustive to face the camera continually for several hours, with powerful lights focused on me at close range. These are the occupational hazards we undergo as film stars which most people fail to understand. But they make haste to make a mountain out of a mole hill. (Srinath Prasanna Jayasuriya)

Standby arrangements with IMF in case of ME crisis: Ranil
	
Sri Lanka is to enter into a standby arrangement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in case of a crisis situation in the Middle East as a result of the machinations of ISIS terrorists next year, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe informed Parliament today.
It is better for Sri Lanka to be prepared for a crisis situation in the Middle East if the conflict caused by the ISIS worsens in 2016," the Prime minister said speaking during the second reading debate on the Budget while highlighting the fact that Sri Lanka would be adversely affected in such an eventuality.
He said 2016 will be an year of uncertainty globally with the economic growth in many countries expected to be stalled.
The Prime Minister invited all political parties to join the government to convert Sri Lanka into a high income-earning country by 2036. "We will be failing our future generations if we cannot achieve this goal," he said.
The Prime Minister told Parliament that the government had decided to do away with the budget proposal to merge the EPF and the ETF and handover its administration to a new body. He once again emphasised that the two funds would not be merged and that they would be administered by the Central Bank as before.
However he said new laws will be brought in to give more legal protection to EPF and ETF as it is in many countries.
Also he informed that the Right to information Bill and a motion to convert Parliament into a constitutional assembly will be brought in earlier next year. He said the Audit Bill will also be presented to House before long. (Yohan Perera)

Ravi K justifies cash withdrawal tax
	
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said today the budget proposal to impose a levy on cash withdrawals was meant to encourage the use of bank drafts and cheques for the transferring of cash.
The government in its 2016 Budget proposed that a levy be imposed on cash withdrawals of Rs.1 million and above. According to the proposal, a 2 percent levy would be imposed on cash withdrawals between Rs.1 million and Rs.10 million while 3 percent would be levied on cash withdrawals exceeding Rs.10 million.
This proposal is meant to encourage the use of bank drafts and cheques instead of cash withdrawals of Rs.1 million and above, the minister said.
Another budget proposal is to transfer all funds lying in dormant bank accounts to the Consolidated Fund, by January 1, 2016.
The Finance Minister said the money would be held in the consolidated fund as long as the accounts are inactive and the Central Bank would release the funds when a customer wished to reactivate the account. This is not a means of confiscating the funds, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
