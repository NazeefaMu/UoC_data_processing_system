He got what he hadnt bargained for!
	
	The sibling number one now on remand (at least nominally) had gathered enough courage to return to Sri Lanka on an assurance given by a certain heavyweight of the new government. Even a powerful one from the diplomatic corps is said to have lulled him into a sense of security.
According to hush-hush in political circles that the sibling had once done the heavyweight of the new government a great favour when he decided to take on rent a building belonging to the latter to house part of his Ministry.
The sibling is said to have helped the heavyweight to escape the fallout from a serious law suit as well.
The sibling had spoken to the Police with hopes riding high that he could get back home safe and sound after making the statement.
But alas! The sibling was arrested after recording his statement on the orders from a higher authority, says a source privy to what went behind the scene.

An affectionate pat on the back in addition to good advice
	
	The deposed strongman recently called at the National Hospital to visit his sibling taken ill soon after being remanded.
He was chatting to the sibling in an upstairs paying ward when he heard several rounds of boos from below.
Later the deposed strongman learnt that the person who raised boos was a minor employee of the hospital.
Those who accompanied the former strongman inquired from the employee why he resorted to booing. The employee had replied: I was not booing at our former boss, but at those exploiting his popularity for their own selfish ends and also those at the hospital who prevented us from extending us greetings to him.
Later the deposed strongman sent for the hospital employee and when he appeared before him he had told him: Listen to my advice, Sahodaraya. Hereafter dont ask for trouble for yourself by making any noise on my behalf. Now go back to work.
The deposed strongman had given an affectionate pat on the back of the employee in addition to his advice.

Ghosts still haunting: Sobitha Thera
	
The ghosts of previous regime were still haunting the country as seen in the recent attack on Dr. Nirmal Ranjith Dewasiri and Dr. Kusum Kumara at Kirulapone on the May Day, Venerable Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera said today.
The Chairman of National Movement for Social Justice Ven. Sobitha Thera also accused the attackers of continuing the practice of the former President to silence the people who had different opinions using violence.
Such incidents are not new to us as we had experienced a cruel time, where all the democratic rights to speak, write, and hold meetings were violated. But, it is sorrowful when such incidents are still happening in the Yahapalana government as well, he said.
He was speaking at a joint press briefing held with the participation of Federation of University Teachers Associations (FUTA), Ceylon Teachers Union, National Movement for Social Justice, Inter-University Students Federation (IUSF) and several other trade unions, condemning the attack and urging an immediate probe into the incident.
Speaking to the media, Deputy President of the FUTA Ven. Dambara Amila Thera requested MPs Wimal Weerawansa, Dinesh Gunawardane and Vasudewa Nayakkara to come to consciousness without wasting time to get their so-called leader back into power.
At least now, the henchmen of former President should change their minds and follow the correct path. Because, it is impossible to realise their dream of getting their lost leader back into politics since the people have understood the truth, Amila Thera said.
He condemned the attack which he said showed a lack of respect for political dissent and complete intolerance of political opposition.(Piyumi Fonseka)

	We all now know that the former Bell party chief the other day staged a brief Satyagraha at Independence Square to urge the authorities to investigate the alleged conspiracy aimed at keeping the former strongman in the saddle of power disregarding the result of the January 8 presidential poll.
However, according to information filtering through the Bell party sources this was not the first time the former chief had staged a sit-in over the issue. One night several weeks ago, the former chief had come all alone to Independence Square and sat under a tree by the roadside and begun a fast-unto-death unknown to party stalwarts or the media.
Several hours later on hearing that the former chief was seen seated by the roadside all alone at the Independence Square, several party high ups who were at the party headquarters rushed to the scene and had forcibly taken him away.
The former Bell party chief earlier in the night had urged, without avail, the young party front-liners to embark on some drastic action to press the authorities to probe the alleged failed coup bid. The former Chief had left the headquarters in a huff and had made a beeline to Independence Square partly to teach a lesson to the bucks of the party hierarchy who would not listen to him.

Kerry assures better times for tea trade with Iran
	
Unites States Secretary of State, John Kerry had indicated that Sri Lankas tea trade, which was affected by US sanctions on Iran, would be normalised within few weeks, a minister said yesterday.
Sri Lanka was unable to export tea directly to Iran because of the US sanctions and therefore the government has been compelled to subsidize the prices. 
However, government leaders including Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera and Planation Minister Lakshman Kiriella raised this matter when they met Mr. Kerry during his visit to Sri Lanka.
He is reported to have said his country was at a delicate stage in the negotiations with Iran on sanctions and requested the Sri Lankan leaders to wait for a few more weeks for any results.
Mr. Kiriella told Daily Mirror that Sri Lankan exporters were unable to open Letters of Credit for their tea exports to Iran because of the sanctions.
Currently, tea exports to Iran are carried out through third parties. This results in high prices in that market and as such the exporters are at a disadvantage, he said.
He said 70 per cent of the tea was produced by small holders in Sri Lanka.
During the pre-sanction days Sri Lanka exported nearly Rs.200 million worth of tea ti Iran annually.

The United National Party (UNP) believed that the Parliament would be dissolved at the end of this month following the enactment of the 20th Amendment to the Constitution, Chief Government Whip Lakshman Kiriella said today.
Kiriella told a media briefing that Parliament should be dissolved now as its term was over. He said there should be a new Parliament when a new President was elected.
"Oil in Parliament machinery should be changed at least once in five years and it is time to do it now," the minister said.
Referring to former UNP General Secretary Tissa Attanayake, the minister said neither he nor others had any issue with Attanayake.
He said it was Attanayake who went against the Party leader and the common opposition candidate at the last Presidential Election.
Responding to a question as to why the UNP could not follow the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), which offered leadership to its former General Secretary, who defected and became the Opposition candidate and gave him a place in the party, the minister said one was recognised in politics only when he or she emerged as a winner. Mr Attanayake backed the losing candidate at the election," he said.
Speaking on his Ministrys work he said the programmes of securing stable prices for tea and rubber, providing land for estate sector workers and minimising inferior quality fertiliser had been done successfully.(Yohan Perera)

Pan Asia Bank doubles 1Q15 net profits to Rs. 177mn
	
Bank records strong core-banking operations amid falling interest ratesPan Asia Banking Corporation PLC (PABC) has posted a net profit of Rs.177 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 (1Q15) recording a growth of 106 percent from a year earlier.
As a result the earnings per share has improved to Rs.2.43 from Rs.1.18 during the period.
The growth in the profit before tax was 231 percent year-on-year (yoy) to Rs. 270.2 million.
The bank has been able to record this commendable performance due to the growth of its loan book coupled with expanding net interest margin. This has also been amply assisted by the cost discipline demonstrated throughout in delivering its services.
During the quarter the bank grew its loans and receivable by 10 percent to Rs. 69.2 billion. This mirrors the pickup in credit growth in the economy in comparison to the much lackluster demand for credit during the corresponding quarter in 2014.
Pan Asia Bank closed the 2014 financial year expanding its loan book by 34 percent, among the highest credit growths by a licensed commercial banks in the country, which continued to 1Q15 as well. 
Meanwhile the bank has managed to significantly improve its Return on Equity (RoE), a key performance measure in the banking industry. During the three months the RoE increased by as much as 5.07 percent to 14.88 percent.
This is considered as a key achievement given the challenge to improve returns to its stockholders by the banking sector when the margins are under continuous pressure and the regulatory capital requirements are increasing.
Commenting on the first quarter performance, the banks Director and CEO, Dimantha Seneviratne said the first quarter performance of the bank is a testament to its prudent management strategies in sustainable asset growth and cost management that provides an ideal platform to reach its financial and other targets set for the remainder of 2015. 
During the first quarter the bank successfully migrated in to its new core-banking platform that will provide more flexibility in providing customized solutions and enhanced services to our clients, Seneviratne further said.        
Core-banking operations of the bank has fared exceptionally well during the quarter supported by the strong growth in credit and the timely asset and liability management.
The top line of the bank measured by the net interest income has grown by a healthy 20 percent year-on-year (yoy) to Rs.849.9 million. This has been possible mainly as a result of the sharp fall in interest expenses.
The interest expenses has fallen by 15 percent during 1Q15 against its corresponding quarter last year due to re-pricing of the deposits at lower interest rates in line with the steep fall in the key market interest rates.
In a bid to diversify the income sources, the bank has made a special emphasis on improving its other income sources.
The net fee and commission income has increased by 47 percent yoy during the quarter to Rs. 202.5 million as a result of strong international trade related incomes.
This was further assisted by the strong remittance incomes collected by the bank leading up to the Sinhala and Tamil new-year.
During the 12 months to March 31, 2015 the bank filled key managerial positions by bringing in industry best professionals while the key talent was brought in at all other levels in bid to groom the next level of leaders of the bank as well as to support the growth.
Pan Asia Bank awaits the direction and economic policy of the new government helping to align the banks strategies in to the countrys growth and economic agenda. Further the bank will continuously strive to understand the needs of the aspirational society in the making in Sri Lanka to provide them with the most suitable and flexible financial solutions that are required by them.
The bank has already implemented its new core-banking system which will enhance its delivery efficiencies and facilitate the diversification in to new financial services.
Further, the bank will continuously invest on increasing its customer touch points; the branches and the digital banking channels which are gaining rapid momentum in the country in a bid to offer a fast and an efficient service to the banks clients

Political bigwig now gets a bigger cut!
	
	Arecanut trade has become a money spinner for two businessmen in this country.
They buy it dirt cheap from Pakistan and sell it to India at a high price thus making a huge profit from every shipment, they say.
Only two businessmen here had been holding the virtual monopoly of the arecanut trade for a long time. One of them is a brother of a national cricketer holding a world record for his spinning prowess.
Recently a political bigwig of the new government hailing from the Colombo district had demanded a sizeable cut from the huge profit that the arecanut traders were making. The cut demanded was so big that the two traders could not immediately give a positive response.
Furious that his demand had gone unheeded, the political bigwig had ordered his officials to issue permits for arecanut imports and exports to five other businessmen of his choice.
Now the political bigwig is happy that he is assured of a sizable something at least from the new five entrants to the trade, they say.

Salman jailed for five years
	
An Indian court has sentenced Bollywood star Salman Khan to five years in jail for killing a homeless man in a 2002 hit-and-run driving incident in Mumbai, the BBC said.
The man was among five people who were run over in the incident. The actor was charged with culpable homicide.
Khan had said his driver was behind the wheel, but the judge said the actor was driving the car and was under the influence of alcohol at the time.
Legal experts expect the actor to appeal against the verdict. He could have been jailed for 10 years.
But correspondents say the guilty verdict is a huge setback for Khan who is one of Bollywood's biggest stars, appearing in more than 80 Hindi-language films.

SLFP: Will take legal action against FCID procedure
	
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) would take legal action against the procedure adopted by the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) to question and prosecute suspects referred to it by the Cabinet Sub-Committee headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
General Secretary of the UPFA Susil Premajayantha told media today that the entire process of recording statements and producing suspects in courts was biased, unethical and illegal.
It is the Cabinet Sub-Committee, Chaired by Wickremesinghe that takes the final decision, whether or not to take action against politicians and officials served under the previous regime. The Cabinet Sub-Committee also decides on the actions to be taken on each suspect.

The FCID records statements and decides whether to file charges against them, refer the file to the Attorney General or the Bribery Commission or let them go free on the directive of the Cabinet Sub-Committee, which is entirely a political witch-hunt never witnessed in Sri Lankas political history, Premajayantha charged. 
Premajayantha said the SLFP had educated President Maithripala Sirisena on this dangerous trend and President Sirisena had promised to look into the issue.
We have information that this ad-hoc Cabinet Sub-Committee has been appointed at a Cabinet meeting not attended by President Sirisena, he said.
Explaining the alleged biased procedure adopted by the FCID, Premajayantha said former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa had been produced before the Kaduwela Magistrate by FCID with an incomplete statement which had asked the Magistrate to put the suspect in remand custody claiming further statements had to be recorded.
How can a Police officer request a Magistrate to put a suspect in remand custody with an incomplete statement It is illegal and unethical, Premajayantha said.
He charged that the FCID was following the legal provisions used by the Defence Secretary in 1980 under Emergency Regulations at a time of normalcy.
Premajayantha said empowering a politician to take action against his or her political opponents was nothing else but political witch-hunt.
It is against the law, against democratic traditions and against all accepted norms of good governance and fair play.
Our legal experts are in the process of preparing now. We firmly believe that we can prove the bias and illegality of this process. We never demand to dismantle the FCID or not to take action against any politician, who has a prima-facie case against him or her. What we oppose is the politicisation of the procedure and political witch hunt using the FCID as a tool, Premajayantha said.

Someone sitting on his pension file
	
	The once powerful secretarial one for defence affairs has yet to receive his pension and the permit for a duty-free vehicle  concession secretarial ones enjoy on retirement. His pension application appears to have been pigeon-holed at the main secretariat, they say.
On inquiries made by some interested parties, the white collar chief at the main secretariat had said that the file containing the pension papers were submitted to the highest authority and he was awaiting the necessary instructions.
Meanwhile, informed sources say that a certain high up at the main secretariat once very close to the deposed strongman is sitting on the pension file.

Suspect arrested for killing Lankan in Texas
	
A 19-year-old suspect was arrested by the Beaumont police in Texas, US in connection with the killing of Sri Lankan store owner in Beaumont.
Officers have named Chandler Kyle Ventress, 19, of Beaumont in a capital murder warrant. Ventress has not been formally charged in the fatal shooting.
A video surveillance camera captured the images of two men wearing masks over their faces as they entered the Pick-N-Stop store on Major Drive around midnight April 28, pointing a pistol at store owner Metthananda Kuruppu, who was tallying the day's receipts.
The police-provided portion of the video showed Kuruppu trying to bat away the robber's pistol as Kuruppu activated an alarm.
Police said Kuruppu then grabbed a BB gun with which to defend himself, but the robber shot him in the chest, killing him.
Kuruppu, a 52-year-old native of Sri Lanka, bought the store two years ago. He has two daughters in college and also leaves a wife.
Both assailants could face capital murder charges, meaning the death penalty could apply if they are convicted at trial because they were committing an armed robbery, an aggravating felony, when the murder occurred. (Beaumontenterprise)

The course of politics like love does not run smooth
	
	
	This provincial chief hailing from a typical political family became a controversial figure ever since he jumped on the bandwagon of the cabal campaigning for the deposed strongmans comeback to politics as the Prime Ministerial candidate. 
Meanwhile some Blue members backing the New Big Boss had unearthed an illicit love affair that the provincial chief is said to be deeply involved in. The other party to the affair is said to be a lady holding high office in a leading school in the area from where the politico hails.
The Blue members involved leaked out the information to the concerned parties and this led to fireworks in the ladys family.
On hearing that the secret affair had gone public, the provincial chief left for the land of the kangaroos.
The Blue members are happy that they could use this love affair as a weapon to subdue the defiant provincial chief. But sources close to him say that the chief will return when the ho-ha over the affair dies down to resume his ride on the bandwagon calling for the deposed strongmans return to politics.

## Title: UK Parliamentary candidate suspended for threatening Lankan

UK Parliamentary candidate suspended for threatening Lankan
	
A Ukip (UK Independence Party) parliamentary candidate has been suspended from the party after he was filmed threatening to shoot his Conservative rival Ranil Jayawardena.
Robert Blay, who is standing in North East Hampshire, told undercover reporters from the UK's Daily Mirror that he would "put a bullet between the eyes" of the Conservatives' Ranil Jayawardena.

The video shows Mr Blay saying that Mr Jayawardena "could become our first Asian MP", adding: "If he is I will personally put a bullet between his eyes".
The 55-year-old went on: "If this lad turns up to be our Prime Minister I will personally put a bullet in him. Thats how strong I feel about it.
I wont have this f***** as our Prime Minister. I absolutely loathe him.
The remarks are said to have been made outside a meeting where Nigel Farage was giving a speech to voters in the seaside town of Ramsgate, Kent.
A Ukip spokesman said: Mr Blay has been suspended with immediate effect".
A former bank accountant, Mr Blay is standing in North East Hampshire, which saw a Conservative majority of 18,500 at the last election.
Questioning Mr Jayawardena's background, he said: "His family have only been here since the 70s. You are not British enough to be in our parliament.
"I've got 400 years of ancestry where I live. He hasn't got that."

				
		
				Ukip leader Nigel Farage in Ramsgate
		
And he told the investigators of the safe seat: "But I've always said in my constituency you could put a monkey out there with a blue rosette on and it would win."
He accused his rival's father of having come to Britain from Sri Lanka and "ponced off us ... like all the East Europeans are".
"His name's Jayawardena and I'm told that name is a Tamil name.
"Well the Tamils were Indians which went to Sri Lanka to take it over and they got their asses kicked. So he comes here, ponces off us and then his son's in our political system."
A Ukip spokesman said Mr Blay had been suspended as soon as the remarks came to light and offered an apology to Mr Jayawardena.
The spokesman pointed to the candidate's "long career" as a Conservative as evidence such views were not confined to its ranks.
"The views expressed by Mr Blay are abhorrent," the spokesman said.
"As soon as they were brought to our attention he was suspended from the party. Any comments of this sort have absolutely no place in British politics or public life, and the party would like to take this opportunity to apologise to Mr Jayawardena for any distressed caused.
"Mr Blay has been immediately suspended from the party. Ukip acts immediately in circumstances such as these.
"Unfortunately, as every party has found over the past few months, internal vetting systems are not perfect, which is reflected in the fact that since January of this year, 300 Labour, Liberal Democrat, and Conservative Party candidates across the country have found themselves suspended, expelled, or even jailed for foul behaviour of all kinds.
"We are also deeply concerned that Mr Blay had a long career in the Conservative Party, including being his local association chairman - which goes to prove that issues with candidates such as these are not limited to Ukip."
Mr Jayawardena said: "I was shocked to hear about these comments and that someone who holds these types of views could have been selected as a Ukip candidate.
"My family believes in hard work. My father came to this country to do just that - never claiming a penny from the state. He's contributed to society as a magistrate and I've done the same as a local councillor.
"I hope to contribute positively to our country by representing my community - the community in which I grew up - in parliament. The only way to stop people like this is to vote Conservative on May 7."
In a separate incident on Tuesday, Ukip candidate John Leathley said he was "appalled and deeply ashamed" of comments he made online about the newspaper columnist Yasmin Alibhai-Brown.
His Facebook postings, which apparently followed an appearance last year by Ms Alibhai-Brown on BBC's Question Time, included statements that the commentator "needs a good shag" and she "would love a big black thing up her a***".
Mr Leathey, who is standing for Nigel Farage's party in Tony Blair's old constituency of Sedgefield, County Durham, apologised "unreservedly" in a statement.
He said: "I read what I wrote now, I am shocked by them and am appalled and deeply ashamed of my words. The comments were made during a private conversation in the evening and clearly were never meant to be publicly released, and they should never have been said.
"I am very sorry and regret deeply being so coarse, it is out of character but no more excusable for that."
The journalist responded by saying that Mr Leathey's comments were "appalling".(The Telegraph)
