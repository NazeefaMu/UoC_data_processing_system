AG says President Sirisenas term is 6 years
	
Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya yesterday contended that incumbent President Maithripala Sirisena can continue his term of office as President for 6 years.
The Attorney General appearing with Additional Solicitor General Murdu Fernando and Deputy Solicitor General Nerin Pulle submitted that the incumbent President Maithripala Sirisena has sought the opinion of the Supreme Court whether there is any impediment to him to continue his terms of office for 6 years as President as amended in the amended Article 31 of the 19th Amendment.
He stated that the Presidential election was held on 8th January 2015 and incumbent President Maithripala Sirisena was elected and assumed duty on 9th January 2015.
He stated the date on which he was elected is 9th January 2015 for the term of office for 6 years.
He submitted that the incumbent President was elected by the people for the office to the term of 6 years. It is the sovereignty of the people who exercise their franchise to elect him as President. The power emanated from the franchise of the people. The commencement of his office should be considered from the date on which he is elected.
He said it is the Constitutional structure where the incumbent President was elected. The 19th Amendment to the Constitution is operative after the incumbent President was elected for a term of 6 years by the people.
He continued that therefore the issue is whether the Article 3 and 4 of the 19th Amendment made operative where the term of office has already commenced.
He said there cannot be retrospective effect unless it has been specified or implied in any provision and there is no applicable provision retrospectively in the amendment.
He said that according to Article 49(1)(a) and (b) stating that for the avoidance of doubt it is hereby declared that (a) the 7th Parliament in existence on the day preceding the date on which this Act comes into operation, shall, unless dissolved earlier, continue to function until April 21, 2016 and shall thereafter stand dissolved.
He said that Article 49(1)(b) states the persons holding office respectively, as the President and Prime Minister on the day preceding April 22, 2015 shall continue to hold such office after such date, subject to the provisions of the Constitution as amended by this Act.
He maintained that the mandate of the people to be a term of office for 6 years on which he assumed duty. He contended that any change would affect and alienate the sovereignty of the people.
Saliya Peiris PC appearing for the intervenient petitioner Ven. Ulapane Sumangala Thera and Faisz Musthapha PC appearing for the Intervenient Petitioner SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake made similar submissions.
A Panel of five judges of the Supreme Court took up the reference to make a decision on the ambiguity over the question of the tenure of office for the incumbent President Maithripala Sirisena as President.
The Bench of Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, Justices Eva Wanasundera, B.P.Aluvihara, Sisira J De Abrew and K.T.Chitrasiri werenominated for the opinion of the Supreme Court on this matter in respect of the ambiguity arising after the enactment of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.
President Maithripala Sirisena has referred the matter to the Supreme Court for its consideration in terms of Article 129(1) of the Constitution.
He has sought the opinion of the Supreme Court that whether, in terms of Provisions of the Constitution, he, as the person elected and succeeding to the office of President and having assumed such office in terms of Article 32(1) of the Constitution on 9th January 2015, has any impediment to continue in the office of President for a period of 6 years from 9th January 2015, the date on which the result of his election to the office of President was declared.
President invoked the Consultative jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under article 129. (1) If at any time it appears to the President of the Republic that a question of law or fact has arisen or is likely to arise which is of such nature and of such public importance that it is expedient to obtain the opinion of the Supreme Court upon it, he may refer that question to that Court for consideration and the Court may, after such hearing as it thinksfit, within the period specified in such reference or within such time as may be extended by the President, report to the President its opinion thereon.

An appreciation Jith de Fonseka possessed amazing qualities
	
When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.
- Kahlil Gibran
I wish to thank the Almighty God for His grace that is upon me to pen these thoughts about my late husband, Jith de Fonseka. Even though I am not a writer, it was in my heart to honour him, as it is 4 years since he went to be with Jesus.
I never thought it would be possible for Suranjith, Sarita and I to continue with the journey of life without Jith. We were a very closely-knit family and had great times together. Jith was an amazing husband who always chose to do his best for the family. Spending quality time with each of us was his main priority. I can hardly remember him saying no to any request that the three of us made. He would go out of his way to do anything to make us happy. We truly miss the times we had together we would laugh and joke together amidst the busyness of life or make it a point to have at least dinner as a family, pray together every day, sneak in a holiday so that we could enjoy one anothers company while getting some rest or have family-night about once every few weeks  all because we believed and still believe in family. What we miss the most is the time the four of us used to have when we got into one big bed and had close, intimate chats about anything and everything. 
Jith also had very sincere qualities when it came to his friends. He would never forget even the smallest thing anyone had done for him, even in the years gone by. He was very simple and a person without guile. He was no respecter of persons and treated the most affluent person the same way he would the poorest of the poor. I truly admire these amazing qualities he possessed as they were rare.
He had the highest regard for his parents who were unique and wonderful people.
Jiths faith in God was simple, yet profound. As a family, we came to realise this even more during the time of his last illness. He had such simple, child-like faith and trusted Lord Jesus with regard to everything. Even when faced with impossible situations, he believed that Gods plan and purpose for His life would prevail. There was not a trace of doubt or fear and he rested in knowing that he was a child of God who was absolutely loved by Him. There is so much that the three of us have learned from him and we are so grateful to him. He was truly a very special human being and we are so thankful to God for ordaining us to be family. We treasure the years the Lord gave us together, as they are priceless and will neverbe forgotten.
Jiths motto was always as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord (Joshua 24:15) and we will pass on this legacy to the next generation and the generations
to come.
- Kithmani

Are you clicking away  your youth
	


Cant take your eyes of those colourful Apps Then probably you are having a relationship with your tech device! This relationship isnt as healthy as you may think of. Technology has so far become part and parcel of our lives and we simply cant stay away from these sophisticated devices. This addiction has made headlines more often than we have possibly imagined and researchers are now exploring ways to encourage people to detach themselves from these devices. 
The anti-social effect these devices have instilled in us has become quite an unpleasant sight. As much as it is rude to be glued to your devices during a conversation or during class, it also has various social, psychological and physical impacts. 
Speaking to Health Capsule, Dr. Ramani Ratnaweera, Consultant Psychiatrist at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, elaborated on these risks imposed on youth and the importance of detaching from these devices at an early age. 

Cheaper mode of information
The Internet gives enough information to add in, in case you run out of facts. Over the years, the Internet has proved itself to be an easily accessible source of information. But the credibility of its facts and sources has most often been debated. According to Dr. Ratnaweera, the internet is the cheapest mode of acquiring information. Therefore children rely on the Internet to find information. This is in terms of academics. But in terms of non-academics, children use the internet to access social media and also play games. Social media is a highly addictive factor associated with the Internet. From all groups children get addicted to it quite fast. Therefore even if theres a major exam, they will find some time to log in to social media and chat with their regular friends. It is the Internet that makes teens get addicted to their tech devices. If not it would be a game which would allow them to be engaged, she said.

Stimulation of the prefrontal cortex
Speaking further, Dr. Ratnaweera said that a chemical reaction is triggered in the brain when children or teens use the Internet. When using the internet their prefrontal cortex gets activated. The prefrontal cortex is of significant importance when top-down processing is needed. Top-down processing by definition is when behaviour is guided by internal states or intentions. When people develop an addiction theres an increase in the secretion of dopamine. Therefore they use the Internet and are addicted to it like they would be addicted to smoking, alcohol or drugs. Thereafter they cant process their thinking capacity to manage time or for other complex mental activities, she explained.
The prefrontal cortex is highly interconnected with much of the brain, including extensive connections with other cortical, subcortical and brain stem sites. It also receives inputs from the brainstem arousal systems, and its function is particularly dependent on its neurochemical environment. According to the Dual Systems Model, the interplay between the prefrontal cortex and socio-emotional system of the brain is relevant for adolescent development.

An anti-social trend
Social media became a social phenomenon altogether. What started off as a platform to get to know new friends became a platform for people to exchange ideas and today it is considered as a new media. To enable this task, sophisticated devices need to function as expected. Therefore, we now have everything at the click of a button. Dr. Ratnaweera further said that teens eventually end up upgrading their technological devices to compete with their friends. So they eventually start working on a desktop, but would want a sophisticated smart phone in the end. Around 60% of children use mobile phones in Sri Lanka and they have a Facebook account. Because theres an App for Facebook it could be easily accessed and children tend to be using it regularly. One of the risks is that they associate with people they dont know. One could have over 1000 friends on Facebook, but how many of them would they actually know Parents now dont have time to talk to their children. They are in their own worlds. Back in the day, the family used to get together at the dining table, but this doesnt happen anymore,affirmed
Dr. Ratnaweera.
Once they connect with their devices, teens develop anxiety, depression and loneliness. They expect their virtual friends to solve their problems, but this doesnt happen. Even with their exams and other work, teens would still want to log in to their accounts and see whats new. These teens are usually very stubborn and there seems to be many problems among children and parents as well. It is natural to see them glued to their phones even later in the night without sleeping. 
Research suggests that students who text longer in the dark also sleep fewer hours and were sleepier during the day than those who stopped messaging when they went to bed. The effects of a blue light emitted from smartphones and other devices are intensified when viewed in a dark room. This short wavelength light can have a strong impact on daytime sleepiness symptoms since it can delay the release of melatonin, making it more difficult to fall asleep even when seen through closed eyelids.


Physical impact
We often see that those staying in one place often become plump over a period of time. Lack of physical activity will eventually develop other conditions such as diabetes and obesity. This could also be observed in children and teens addicted to the Internet. Dr. Ratnaweera further said that those who are addicted to their devices have physical issues as well. They are usually very fat, dont eat well and dont exercise as well. They also develop other conditions such as backaches and weak eyesight. When you go to a party those days, children and teens used to play around. But today we see the opposite because everybody is glued to their devices. They seem to be alone in their own world and it is rude not be socializing with the rest of the crowd. Children spend more than six hours of the week on their phones and they lack sleep as well,she added.
Internet addiction could also bring about changes in lifestyles and it could have an adverse impact on the growth and development of Internet addicts. It could also affect emotional well-being and would bring about various side effects as a result of this addiction. 

Interventions
Its important to intervene on behaviours such as Internet and technology addiction at an early age. Once adolescents develop a habit, it would be difficult to get them out of it. Dr. Ratnaweera said that during counselling sessions they often try to take them out of this habit. We therefore encourage them to read books and engage in other activities. We make parents aware of their children and also convince them how important it is to closely associate with their children. Children can think creatively and these abilities would be suppressed if they develop such addictions. Parents need to supervise and guide children in their developmental stages. We also do Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) where we try to get them back to socialize with people and disconnect them from these devices,
she concluded.

Warning signs of technology addiction include :
A sense of euphoria while plugged in
	Neglecting friends and family
	Skimping on sleep
	Being dishonest about usage
	Feeling anxious, ashamed, guilty or depressed as a result of technology use
	Withdrawing from other activities that were once pleasurable
Physical symptoms of technology addiction include :
Weight gain or weight loss
	Carpal tunnel syndrome
	Headaches
	Neck or backaches
	Dry, red eyes

Award-winning Pakistani journalist escapes kidnap attempt
	

ISLAMABAD AFP Jan10, 2018 - A Pakistani journalist known for criticising the powerful military said he had escaped an abduction attempt after being assaulted by armed men in Islamabad Wednesday, in the latest case involving forced disappearances in the turbulent country.
Taha Siddiqui, who won Frances highest journalism award the Albert Londres prize in 2014, said he was attacked by up to a dozen men en route to the airport in Rawalpindi but managed to escape before being kidnapped, suffering minor injuries during the scuffle.
Safe and with police now. Looking for support in any way possible #StopEnforcedDisappearances, wrote Siddiqui in a tweet posted on a fellow journalists account.
He later said the attempt bore similarities to previous abductions by authorities, suggesting that agencies may have been involved.
But he maintained he had no plans to leave Pakistan, and instead called on authorities for protection.
I think the idea is to silence me, Siddiqui told a press conference.
Im here. Im staying put, he added.

BOOK REVIEW Taking a peep into the life of a royal artificer
	
Great Royal Artificer of the Kandyan Kingdom  Devendra Mulachari authored by D. D. M. Waidyasekera 2017, A Stamford Lake Publication, pp.134
In, the over 2500 year old history of Sri Lanka, Kandy and the Kandyan Kingdom have played historic roles in maintaining the sovereignty and culture of the nation. The Kingdom is well known for its ancient historical monuments, unique architecture, carvings, arts and crafts, paintings among others which constitute the core of Sri Lankan civilization and culture. While they were built under the patronage of the Kandyan Kings, credit accrues not only to the workmen themselves whose services were provided under the prevailing Rajakariya system, but also to the various artificers, designers, craftsmen, painters and others who contributed to their construction. 
This book is a historical research study of the life and work of one of its brilliant artificers and designers Devendra Mulachari who contributed to the designing and construction of a number of prominent monuments in the Kandyan Kingdom. His achievements include the picturesque Pattiripuwwa of The Dalada Maligawa, The Cloud Wall, Kirimuhuda of Kandy Lake, Magul Maduwa, or Audience Hall apart from a number of Vihares, Maduwas, Carvings etc. that dotted the Kandyan Kingdom. He lived and worked under three kings, Kirthi Sri Rajasinghe (1747-1782), Rajaadhi Rajasinghe (1782-1798) and Sri Wickrema Rajasinghe (1798-1815). 
Achievements not recognised 
However little is known or has been written about his life and work and his achievements have not received due recognition. As Ananda Coomaraswamy states, The names of artificers are not recorded in their work nor as a rule remembered except by their own descendants. Coomaraswamy, Medieval Sinhalese Art (P.59). 
It is in this context that the author has done considerable research into the origins, life and work, his demise and the descendants of this remarkable personality. A number of books and research work of reputed scholars and writers such as Ananda Coomaraswamy, H. W. Codrington, John DOyly, Robert Knox, A. C. Lawrie, H. C. P. Bell and articles and works of others such as Prof. J. B. Dissanayake, S. A. Karunaratne, S. K. Jayawaredena, Somapala Wijesundera to mention a few, have been the basis of the authors research on this topic. All these have been acknowledged in the relevant places and in the References in the book. 
The Foreword is written by the reputed scholar and researcher Prof. K. D. Paranavitana, former Deputy Director of the National Archives. 
Facts have also been secured from old law records in the Kandy Archives, Colombo Archives, National Museum, Royal Asiatic Society as well as photos and anecdotes from others including his current descendants. A unique feature is the reproduction of a wood carving of the Mulachari in official attire given in the book. 
The Appendix contains a number of old relevant Sannasas, Judicial Commissioners Court Proceedings of 1817 and 1824 among others including a copy of the 1815 Kandyan Convention. 
A brief resume of the authors findings on Devendra Mulachari has earlier been provided in a chapter in his book. The royal Artificers of Mangalagama and their Descendants but as per numerous requests and on the basis of more research, this separate volume has been compiled. 
Descendants of Aryans 
Chapter I deals with the origins and ancestry of the clan of artificers who are descendants of a race of Aryans who entered India across the Punjab long before Vyasa began the collection of the Vedas. They are known as Vishwa Brahamins or Deva Brahmins and their trade is as old as the Rigveda. Their mythical ancestor is Vishwakarma and their flag is the Hanuman Flag shown and described in the chapter. The gold and silver artificers formed 4 workshops under the supervision of a Mulachari who as Prof. Tennakoon Vimalananda stated was an expert in at least 5 arts and crafts. 
The Chapter also deals with the ancestry of Devendra Mulachari who was born probably around AD 1747 during the reign of King Kirthi Sri Rajasinha. A number of theories as to his exact place of birth and origin is discussed and put forward by writers such as Mirando Obeysekera, Prof. Jayadeva Tilakasiri and A.C. Lawries Gazetteer. 
His earliest architectural works the Mideniya Maduwa at Mideniya near Kandy and the Pekada Kammala in Kotmale are described in Chapter 2. His most outstanding work was the designing and building of the Pattirippuwa commencing in 1800 and completing within 2 years in 1802 and is described in Chapter 3 while the construction of the Cloud Wall, the Kandy Lake in 1807, the Diyarella Bemma are given in Chapter 4 followed by a description and details of the building of the Audience Hall in Chapter 5. His other contributions such as Degaldoruwa as well as arts and carvings at Embekke are described in the next chapter and which contains a number of paintings and carvings as illustrations. 
Chapter 7 deals with his position and life in the Kandyan Court, gifts and Sannasas received by him and described, especially his official attire complete with his unique Riyan Danda which he carried like a walking stick to distinguish himself from the other Adigars and Courtiers. His family and residence are also described in the chapter. Chapter 8 deals with his demise while still engaged in constructing the Magul Maduwa amidst court intrigue which led to his death. 
His relations and associates are given in Chapter 9 which includes a section on the Ven. Weliwita Sri Saranankara Sangharaja Thera and Wilbagedera Muhandiram who were chiefly responsible for bringing the Upasampadawa from Siam in 1753. Details of his recent descendants are provided in the final Chapter 10 which contains a Genealogy Chart of his descendants. 
All in all the contents of the book would be of great interest to scholars, historians, social scientists, students and the general public alike. 
A Stamford Lake publication, the book is available at all leading bookshops.

Dealing with  Vitamin D  deficiency
	

Vitamins are compounds which are necessary for the growth and development of human beings. These vitamins help maintain bodily functions such as metabolism, immunity and digestion. They also make sure that your body grows and functions optimally. Vitamin D plays a substantial role in the regulation of calcium in the body and maintaining the level of phosphorous in the blood. These nutrients are required to keep your bones, teeth and muscles healthy. Vitamin D deficiency means that your body is not getting enough of it to stay healthy. The human body requires vitamin D in order to absorb calcium and promote bone growth. The risk of cognitive impairment as well as cardiovascular diseases in adults, have also been associated with Vitamin D deficiency. 

What isVitamin D
Known as the Sunshine vitamin, vitamin D is produced in response to the human body being exposed to sunlight. It is also one of the fat-soluble vitamins and there are two forms of it, D2 and D3. Fortified foods like fatty fish such as Tuna, Mackerel and Salmon, Egg yolks, some dairy products, plant foods and supplements include a fair amount of Vitamin D. Research has revealed the importance of Vitamin D in protecting against a host of health problems. 
The Health Capsule got in touch with Dr. Renuka Jayatissa, Consultant Medical Nutritionist at the Medical Research Institute, who explained to us the importance of the nutrition that
Vitamin D provides. 
The lack of Vitamin D has a direct impact on your bones. Vitamin D levels are strongly associated with chronic back pain and the lack of Vitamin D could weaken your bones. People who lack Vitamin D in their system are liable to get bone fractures and osteoporosis later in their lives. The lack of Vitamin D causes Rickets in children, which is a condition that results in soft and fragile bones. Just as bone ailments are quite common in people who suffer from the lack of Vitamin D, muscle fatigue and muscle weakness might occur frequently too,explained Dr. Jayatissa.

How can you tell if there is Vitamin D deficiency
Vitamin D deficiency is incredibly common, but most people seem to be unaware of it. The symptoms of Vitamin D deficiency are often subtle and non specific, but there are some prominent symptoms that you need to take seriously too.

- Bone pain and back pain
- Frequent bone fractures
- Muscle weakness
- Unexplained fatigue

Why is Vitamin D important
Vitamin D is extremely important when it comes to your immune system, brain and nervous system as well. It helps regulate insulin levels, aids diabetes management as well as supports lung function and improved cardiovascular health. By making sure that you eat a balanced diet rich in vitamin D and taking supplements when needed would help in rectifying the lack of vitamin D in your system. Getting plenty of sleep and making healthy choices when it comes to your health can also be extremely beneficial. Nutrients are essential in order to maintain your health. Making sure that the lack of these nutrients doesnt impact your health, affecting almost every aspect of your life is extremely important when it comes to being a healthy human being.

Death toll in California mudslides rises; more missing
	

Emergency crews climbed and clawed through thick flows of mud and dangerous debris Wednesday in some of southern Californias most exclusive neighborhoods, as the death toll from the collapse of rain-soaked hillsides rose to 17 people with more than a dozen others missing.
This neighborhood of gated homes and sloping streets just south of Santa Barbara has taken on the character of a Hollywood set, weeks after flames threatened the kind of destruction that mudslides have done in days. Wide swaths of ash and earth have smashed multimillion-dollar homes into pieces, filled hotel lobbies with muck, and blocked the main highway from Los Angeles for miles with mud several feet high.
But the human tragedy, which unfolded overnight Tuesday and continued Wednesday, far exceeded the emotional punch of the severe property damage. Whole families have been carried away by the mud. Rescued children who survived their parents remain in critical condition in a hospital whose staff is challenged by road closures and their own damaged property. At least 13 other people are missing.
As helicopters picked families off the roofs of their battered homes, community members branched out on their own in search of survivors and bodies, searching creek beds and canyons, runoff points at local beaches, and splintered piles of wood and stone that once were homes.
Churches became shelters for the thousands of evacuated people, who may have no place to live for months. Thousands of others are without water or power and may remain so for days.

Do you know what Vitiligo is
	

Ever seen individuals with white and pale patchy areas on the skin Ever wondered why these people have a skin different to yours
Todays article is on Vitiligo which is a long-term skin condition which is characterized by pale, white patches, developing on the skin due to the lack of this skin pigmentation known as Melanin. Vitiligo can affect any part of our skin, but commonly involves the area which is vastly exposed to the sun including face, neck and hands.

Causes
Even though the exact etiology for this condition is not known clearly, certain autoimmune conditions and underlying health problems related to nerve endings, sudden emotional trauma and stress are thought to be increasing the risk. Other causes can be regular consumption of vegetables and fruits treated with insecticide/pesticide, recurrent episodes of Jaundice or Typhoid fever, heavy Antibiotic treatment, corticosteroid treatment and poor personal hygiene.
In 50% of affected individuals, the initial skin changes would appear before the age of 20, but not as a rule. Both men and women are equally affected and there is no known predominance in any ethnicity.
This condition can usually be diagnosed accurately by analyzing a complete history from the patient and with a thorough physical examination of the affected skin areas. This is mostly done by using an ultraviolet lamp, shone on the skin in order to gain a better visualization in more detail and also to rule out other skin conditions.
Other blood tests to exclude autoimmune conditions like Diabetes and Thyroid profile to exclude Hyperthyroidism will also be carried out in suspected individuals.

Treatment
White patches on skin caused by Vitiligo have no permanent cure. Yet the appearance could be improved with certain medications. In fact, relatively small patches can be concealed with skin camouflage creams or cosmetic concealers.
Furthermore, severe and extensive patches could be treated with a combination of treatments including photo-therapy and medication.
However, since the spreading of the disease cant be halted completely, it is important to advice the affected individuals to minimize the exposure of their skin to sun light, to prevent negative out comes.

Complications
As far as the complications of Vitiligo are concerned, the lack of Melanin can result in sun burns and increase the risk of skin carcinoma caused by chronic exposure to Ultra violet rays from the sun. Also, some individuals may get affected due to the lack of pigmentation in eyes and suffer partial loss of hearing which is known as Hypoacusis.
Additionally, this can also result in problems related to confidence and self-esteem, so it is highly important to get social support from charity and social services in order to change the negative attitudes of the communitytowards Vitiligo.  

Your Queries
Q Im suffering from neck and shoulder pain since last July. Where could I get prolotherapy treatment in Sri Lanka 
 Dear reader, first of all, to simply explain what Prolotherapy is, it is a procedure where certain sugar solutions like dextrose are injected on multiple instances to the muscles/ joints etc. Prolotherapy is not practiced in western medicine: it falls outside the scope of proven remedies in rheumatology. There are no clinical studies to prove this works regarding pain. One needs multiple prolotherapy injections according to literature on alternative therapy to obtain some benefit. And as practicing rheumatologists we think that the sugar injections are just producing a Placebo effect. That is they are temporarily reducing the pain because of a psychological benefit. Unfortunately rheumatologists do not practice prolotherapy in Sri Lanka and I do not know of reputed hospitals where this treatment is provided. Dr Himantha Atukorale -MBBS(Colombo) MD - Consultant in Joint Disease and Rehabilitation

Clarification
With reference to our article headlined A Medical guide to control diabetes in the Health Capsule dated January 5, we have inadvertently stated that it was written based on a lecture delivered by Consultant Physician Dr. M. Sarath Gamini de Silva at a seminar organised by the Health Education Bureau.
What we published was a translation of a Sinhala article written by Dr. M. Sarath Gamini de Silva in a booklet provided to us by the Drug Committee of Sri Lanka Medical Association 2016 for reproduction in the newspaper.

Europe urges unity to back Iran nuclear deal
	

(c) 2018, The Washington Post  Brian Murphy  Jan 11, 2018 - Top European diplomats offered Irans foreign minister blanket support Thursday for the landmark nuclear deal with Tehran even as the White House weighs whether to step away from the pact. 
But the European envoys also questioned Irans foreign minister, Mohammed Javad Zarif, over disputes such as the countrys missile program and its role in Syrias war as a key ally of President Bashar Assad. 
The messages from the foreign ministers of France, Britain and Germany sought to acknowledge the range of Western concerns including Irans ballistic missile development and the crackdowns following street protests across Iran earlier this month. 
But Europe also signaled its opposition to the Trump administration over the 2015 nuclear deal, which ended most international sanctions in exchange for curbs on Irans nuclear program.

For warding off malefic planetary influences
	
According to ancient Indian Rishis gems and precious stones can be used to vanquish enemies, win friends, gain marital happiness and even enhance political power and prestige.
We propose to discuss here the gems and precious stones one should wear to ward off the malefic influences caused by different planets and also to maximize the favourable effects they produce as prescribed by the ancient Indian sages. 

Ruby for the Sun
Ruby is recommended for wearing when Sun is afflicted or badly located in the Natal Chart.
The Sun governs lungs, eyes, heart, nerves, bones, spine, veins and the right side of the human body.
When the Sun is afflicted, one may suffer from heart diseases, disorders in the brain, defects in the right eye, dental diseases etc. An afflicted Sun would also cause disgrace, degradation and impediments in the way of career success. An afflicted Sun can also lead to illness of father and the displeasure of superiors at the workplace.
A Ruby picked for wearing should weigh at least four carats and It may be studded in a gold ring.

In an article carried under the title, Gems for healing and good luck, in the Jyotisha page last December 22, this writer discussed the virtues of gems and precious stones and the rationale for using them to ward off malefic planetary influences, prevent and cure diseases and bring happiness and prosperity.


Pearl and Moonstone for the Moon
Pearl and moonstone have been prescribed by ancient seers to counteract the ill-effects produced by an afflicted Moon in the Natal Chart.
The Moon governs the throat, chest, blood, neck and the stomach.
A weak or an afflicted Moon could cause losses in business, loss of job, grief, mental unrest Melancholia, sickness or death of mother, the antagonism of women and relatives marital unhappiness. The weak Moon can also obstruct higher education, research and foreign travel.
Rheumatism, gout in the wrists and feet, bowel disorders, palsy, dropsy, lunacy, apoplexy, diseases of the heart, liver, breast and lungs, gynecological problems, cough, cold, bronchitis could be the result of a weak Moon. These problems may visit the native during the Maha Dasa of the afflicted Moon.

Phlegmatic ailments
Cough and cold as well anxieties and worries are indicated when the Moon is aspected by Rahu or is conjunct with it. When is aspected by or is conjunct with Saturn, the native would suffer from anxieties, worries, mental depression and a pessimistic frame of mind.
According to Astrological classical work, Jataka Chandrika, Cats Eye too is effective in counteracting the ill-effects caused by the weak Moon.
A pearl weighing four carats studded in silver worn on the ring finger would ward off the ill-effects resulting from a weak Moon. If moonstone is to be worn on a finger, it should weigh 8 to 10 carats.

Red Coral for Mars
Red Coral is prescribed for dispelling the ill-effects of Mars.
Mars governs stomach, bone marrow, left ear, veins, arms, genitals, forehead and the hip of the human body.
When Mars is afflicted in ones Natal Chart, one may during Mars Maha Dasa, suffer from wounds, fever, jaundice, diseases in the males genitals, measles, cholera, fistula, hemorrhage etc. native becomes prone to accidents and is liable to undergo surgery.
Conjugal unhappiness, disputes over lands and other property, quarrels with brothers, and enmity with relatives are also indicated by a weak Mars.
Wearing Red Coral would help avert the aforesaid ailments and unfortunate circumstances. Natives under the influence of Mars are advised to wear 8-10 carats of red coral in silver or copper.

Forcing principal to kneel: Uva CM denies allegations
	
Chief Minister Uva Province Chamara Dasanayake told the media yesterday afternoon at his office that it was absolutely a false allegation that he threatened and forced a principal of a Tamil girls school in Badulla to kneel down before him.
He said that he received complaints that the principal concerned being a Hindu had discriminated the students of other faiths and that he called her to his official residence to inquire into the complaint in the presence of the Secretary to the Provincial Ministry of Education, Director of Education and the parents who made the complaint.
I only requested the principal to be cautious of acts that could disturb communal harmony and after a friendly discussion we could settle the dispute amicably. After the meeting the principal and the parent saluted me in the oriental fashion and left. However, the JVP Provincial Councillor Samantha Vidyarathana has resorted to a false propaganda from the political platform to tarnish my image. I will take legal action against him, he said.
Meanwhile, the Principal R. Bhavani who refused the allegation levelled against the Chief Minister, confirmed his version of the story.
She said that she met the Chief Minister at his residence to inquire into a complaint made by two parents and that the issue was resolved in a friendly atmosphere. She further said politicians were attempting to gain cheap political mileage through false propaganda. (Prasad Rukmal and Prasanna Pathmasiri)

Inflating the critics, inflating the critiqued The second of four articles delving into the problems
	
I am amused by the tactics certain critics in this country resort to. They claim in opinion piece after opinion piece that they are free from the dominant ideological hegemonies that are supposed to exist in the country (Sinhala Buddhism), but then pay obeisance to other more dominant ideologies that hold sway elsewhere (postmodernism). This is as true for political commentators as it is for film and literary critics, after all theres nothing much to separate the one from the other at the end of the day. The political exists in the cultural, and the cultural exists in the political. That is why I think the problems of our film industry can be traced to the limitations of those who write on the medium. 
Oba Nathuwa Oba Ekka

[Prasanna] Vithanage punctures the ongoing lies of the Rajapaksa regime and the media, whose primary mission is to cover up the war crimes that were committed against hundreds of thousands of ordinary people during the bloody conflict
The World Socialist Web (WSW) is a wonderful online portal where committed old leftists get together and churn out article after article examining and revealing conspiracy theories and hegemonies which apparently exert influence over both the private and the public spheres. It has not languished, but it has, as the homepage informs us, been coerced into submission since of late by leading global corporations which want to get it out of the World Wide Web (www). Now I do not subscribe to conspiracy theories, but when it comes to the WSWS, there is enough evidence as to why critiques of establishment politics and disclosures of connections between powerful private interests and the corridors of power established therein can suffice for such corporations to censor such websites in the long run. I am less interested in these allegations, however, than I am in how this site reflects disparate opinions regarding the arts: film reviews, book reviews, theatre reviews.
Selvi is holding her suitcase and Sarathsiri switches on the television, which is broadcasting a military parade celebrating Rajapaksas so-called war victory

I know of a friend of mine who expresses distaste at the American cinema and what has not unduly been termed Hollow-wood by those who see in the products of that cinema an erasure of the imbalances of power between social milieus in favour of a convenient feel-good liberalism. We all grew up on superheroes, in fact we graduated to superheroes rather early on in our childhoods, because they were pervasive. My friend, who might have grown up on such cosmetic figureheads himself, scoffs at them with the telling remark, Hollow-wood at it again! I am not sure whether he shares the sentiments of those who write to the WSWS, but I think that he does. Consider, for instance, this review of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, written by Michael McEgan and David Walsh:
Age Asa Aga

Positive messages

Many of those involved in the new films production have stated in interviews that the reason people are still attracted to Star Wars after 40 years is that the series has a positive message and gives people hope. The problem is that this hope is not founded on any real answers to, or even explorations of, real problems. The fixation on good and evil personalities does not go far beyond the tabloid-soap opera approach to social reality  or the rubbish of American political campaigns where voters are encouraged to choose a man or woman based on images generated by the media, entirely apart from their social position and program (he has an honest face, she has leadership capabilities). 
In Marxist criticism an objet dart becomes a work of art by its act of being consumed by audiences; the book by its reader, the song by its listener, the film by its viewer. What levels the one with the other, i.e. the objet with its intended recipient, is the dominant framework the former affirms. For McEgan and Walsh, being the seasoned critics they no doubt are, the solutions proposed by a Hollywood blockbuster like Star Wars are at best dichotomised, between an unreal good and an unreal bad, and these are reflected in the world of political advertising where candidates are demarcated as the way forward (think of Donald Trump as Darth Vader, Bernie Sanders as Luke Skywalker). In other words, the dominant framework dictates what good and evil are, which in turn explains Hollywoods fixation in depicting these two as irreconcilable polar opposites. 
What these two critics achieve is what any critic worth his or her salt should achieve; the dismantling of the facade in favour of the reality. That is not the preserve of Marxist critics only, of course, after all even Pauline Kael, Susan Sontag, and Roger Ebert (who cant be considered as Marxists by any stretch of the imagination) indulged in this technique. But then McEgan and Walsh are not mainstream critics; the likes of them have to be content with online portals which are constantly threatened by capitalist censorship, which do not have the funds necessary to pay their contributors. These sites delve deeper than any other site or publication into the underlying framework of a political or cultural process. Theres no critical distancing between the artiste and his intentions, in other words. Entertainment is shown to be the crass, crudely conceived escapist medium it always has been. The experience that Star Wars evokes, consequently, is superficial, operating on a rift between good and evil which the world does not subsist on.

Feeling alienated

Non-mainstream writers like the above, strangely, find their equivalent in the mainstream critic here, if at all because, as I mentioned in this column last week, theres a gap in Sri Lanka between art and entertainment in which our critics ignore the audience that patronises the latter to such an extent that they (the audience) feel alienated. Its a curious phenomenon, deserving of more than a second glance, because in it we see what ails our artistes and what empowers their critics. If the premise of a review of a movie like Star Wars is that its faulty because it doesnt reflect the social reality, and instead shows us a world split between good and evil, it is because the critics themselves are, while committed leftists, aware of the falsifications the left and the right indulge in when portraying that world. In that sense I think our Marxist critics are behind. Way behind. 
More often than not, Marxist critics tend to appraise a work of art on the basis of its fidelity to what is social. In Dharmasena Pathirajas Bambaru Avith, the protagonist-antihero Victor (Vijaya Kumaratunga) could have been easily turned into a spoilt heir who corrupts Helen, the peasant virgin (Malini Fonseka). But he wasnt. The reactions Pathirajas film got were hence predictable: the critics considered it an aberration that the capitalist/pre-capitalist civilisations contrasted against each other werent reflected in a good/bad dichotomy between Victors and Helens wider milieus. The only praise it got from these critics, as Regi Siriwardena noted, was for its ending, where the Rohana Wijeweera-like Weerasena stands on a platform and delivers an eloquent speech explaining the political reality to the coastal peasants. But here too the critics failed: they were praising his rhetoric when the director had in fact staged that sequence to convey to the audience the futility of resorting to abstractions when discerning any political reality. 
Resorting to abstractions and dichotomies is what our critics, especially Marxists, though not always so, indulge in. Again I go back to the World Socialist Web, to a review of another film that came out in 2015 here: Oba Nathuwa Oba Ekka. Just read this excerpt from the review, written by Wasantha Rupesinghe and Panini Wijesiriwardena: 
What these two critics achieve is what any critic worth his or her salt should achieve; the dismantling of the facade in favour of the reality
[Prasanna] Vithanage punctures the ongoing lies of the Rajapaksa regime and the media, whose primary mission is to cover up the war crimes that were committed against hundreds of thousands of ordinary people during the bloody conflict. The point is powerfully driven home in a scene where the young couple arrive home after their marriage. Selvi is holding her suitcase and Sarathsiri switches on the television, which is broadcasting a military parade celebrating Rajapaksas so-called war victory.

Mainstream Hollywood cant stand up to reality because it takes a decidedly refined, artificial approach to that reality. Rupesinghe and Wijesiriwardena take each and every point in the plot in terms of their fundamentalist distinction between good and bad. So how does one differentiate between the two reviews By understanding that THOSE critics prefer a film that unearths the real structures of power hidden by artificial good/bad rifts, and that OUR critics like to unveil the ethnic (and class) relations those structures of power thrive on by looking for a good/bad distinction in the films they are reviewing. To their credit, of course, the latter two do point at a significant aspect of the war that Vithanages film brings up: the unemployed Sinhalese youth forced into the war by economic circumstances. But the good/bad rift remains, intact: there are no shades of grey, no middle ground or territory. Only the one or the other. Has this helped improve our movies, particularly those touted as serious and art house Probably not.

Looking for an easy way out
	

According to a rumour making rounds these days a leading businessman with close connections to a very high political authority has planned to transfer the ownership of one of his business undertakings to the state to cover a massive payment he is required to make to the government. However, on being told that the value of the assets of his particular business undertaking falls far short of the amount of money he has been required to pay as a punitive measure, the business tycoon is said to have discussed with the political authority friend at a midnight tryst how to get over the problem.

The man now legally bound to pay a hefty amount of money in recompense is reportedly planning to make the full payment by a transfer of lesser important assets in a bid to retain his main business interests intact. After meeting with the high political authority, the business tycoon is said to have held council with a team of lawyers.

Mueller  interview unlikely says Trump
	

US, (Daily Mail), 10 January 2018 - President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he doesnt see why hed be asked for an interview from special counsel Robert Mueller because investigators have not found any evidence of collusion between his campaign and Russia. 
Trump signaled that hed be open to it but did not have any reason to think hed be called in for questioning. 
Well see what happens. Certainly Ill see what happens. But when they have no collusion and nobodys found any collusion at any level it seems unlikely that youd even have an interview, he said at a news conference. Mueller and his team of investigators have reportedly said they want to interview President Trump in person as they move forward with the Russia probe  and Trumps lawyers are said to be reaching out for ways to protect the president by limiting the inquiry. 
It has long been understood that investigators would seek answers from the man who presided over the campaign and White House that has been probed over issues ranging from any collusion to possible obstruction of justice and other matters.Prosecutors have indicated they will likely seek an interview with Trump, the Washington Post reported. Such a preference would be in keeping with standard prosecutorial strategy to talk to everyone who might have knowledge of a situation under investigation. 
The push was confirmed by people close to the president.

Pilgirmage to Sabarimale in Kerala When teacher-student relationship is a must for survival
	
Devotees trek through the jungle
Clad in black they walked as if they had little to do with this world. Their beards and nails had grown, but there was no indication that they were unclean. When this writer saw these men in black they were getting ready for the pilgrimage which would take them to Sabarimale in Kerala, India which is the abode of Lord Ayyappan. 
In fact a large batch of Lord Ayyapan devotees left the shoes of Sri Lanka on January 8 for India to make the 60km trek through the jungles of the Periyar Tiger Reserve in the Western Ghat Mountain Range in the Pathanamthitta District in Kerala. The trek through the jungles is challenging, but devotees say that Lord Ayyapan provides them with the strength needed to complete the journey. The less affluent have received or raised the needed money quite effortlessly once they did make up their minds about going on this pilgrimage. Devotees believe that this God works in miraculous ways. 
The main season to go on this pilgrimage begins on November 15 and concludes on December 26. The temple is also open to receive devotees on January 14 and April 14. 
The Sabarimale Temple
Strict vows
Devotees have to prepare for the journey by undergoing a 41-day fast during which strict vows are practised. This fast helps devotees transcend earthly limitations and change for the better. Those who wish to obtain the blessings of Lord Ayyapan have to cleanse themselves, both outside and within. For this they need to obtain the blessings of a seasoned traveller to Sabarimale who is known as a Guru Swami, someone who becomes their teacher. Devotees shun all social activities and immerse themselves in prayers and religious activities after taking up vows. They abstain from consuming meat, indulging in unnecessary talk and harming others in any possible way. They also become celibate during this fast. The wearing of a mala (Necklace made of beads) indicates that the devotee has committed himself to renounce material temptations. The devotee who makes his maiden pilgrimage is known as Kanni Ayyapa. 
The travel bag which contains offerings for the Lord
There are also confirmed stories of miracles happening on the way to Sabarimale. The jungle path to the temple is grown with herbs, hence certain ills of those walking on them are permanently cured
The temple of Lord Ayyapan is one of many temples in India open to all faiths. The authorities there by conducting religious activities have promoted secularism and communal harmony. Vijekanthan Guru Swami who made the trip last year told this writer that all are equal before Lord Ayyapan. 
Popular folklore states that references to the Lord date back to the time of King Rajashankara. The king didnt have children. Later he was presented with a child. The child one day fired an arrow and told his father to go and build a temple where the object he fired had fallen. This is the temple to which pilgrims have been arriving in large numbers, a practice which began before 12th Century AD.

Herbs and miracles
Devotees who make the journey do it for the sheer love of the Lord. Obtaining blessings is all what most pilgrims wish for. But there are others who speak about having become able to upgrade their lives financially after the trip to Sabarimale. There are also confirmed stories of miracles happening on the way to Sabarimale. The jungle path to the temple is grown with herbs, hence certain ills of those walking on them are permanently cured. Those who make the pilgrimage to the temple also go with the belief that one such trip eradicates sins accumulated during 64 human births. 
A replica of the flight of steps that lead to the temple,which is seen in many kovils in Sri Lanka
The trek to Sabarimale is considered to be one of the largest pilgrimages in the world. As many as 45-50 million devotees visit the temple annually. For the record Sri Lankans belonging to many faiths make the trip to Sabarimale each year. The number of Sri Lankan devotees travelling annually to India on this pilgrimage has been calculated as being around 5000. 
The transformation
All the mental discipline thats maintained transforms the devotee. Close associates of these devotees say that the trip transforms the latter. Hindus believe that the fast they undergo to qualify for the pilgrimage helps prepare themselves for further spiritual progress. Hindus also believe that when the need to satisfy desires is removed, a person then experiences supreme bliss. 
However, women of menstrual age arent permitted to make the trip to Sabarimale. In 1991 the Kerala High Court restricted women who were of menstrual age from offering worship at the temple. However, the Supreme Court of India has taken a petition to review this judgment made by the High Court and allow women of all ages to go on the pilgrimage. The Supreme Court has hence referred the case to a constitutional bench to make a decision on this. 
Devotees carrying offerings for the Lord
In a few days time those who left the shoes of Sri Lanka will return, blessed. They will be received by their loved ones with Godly love. Those who went on the pilgrimage will bless those who remained at home. Its amazing how the teacher-disciple chain used in educating pilgrims who wish to make the trip to Sabarimale has continued for centuries!

President can hold office only for 5 years: Counsel
	
Counsel Manohara de Silva PC appearing for the intervenient petitioner Prof. G.L.Peiris on the question of the term of office of incumbent President Maithripala Sirisena,countered the contention of the Attorney General and maintained that under Article 30(2) of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, the President can hold office for a terms of five years.
He said it is not a question of prospectively or retrospectively on the term of office of the incumbent President.
He submitted that the incumbent President can hold office under the transitional provision 49 in the 19th Amendment subject to the provision of the Constitution as amended by this Act (19th Amendment to the constitution).
He said that section 49(b), states that the persons holding office respectively, as the President and Prime Minister on the day preceding April 22, 2015 shall continue to hold such office after such date, subject to the provisions of the Constitution as amended by this Act (19th Amendment).
He submitted that if the incumbent President is aggrieved by the reduction of his term of office, he should have come to the Supreme Court under Article 121(1) when the 19th Amendment Bill was presented to Parliament.
The Article reads: The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to ordinarily determine any such question as aforesaid may be invoked by the President by a written reference addressed to the Chief Justice, or by any citizen by a petition in writing addressed to the Supreme Court. Such reference shall be made, or such petition shall be filed, within one week of the Bill being placed on the Order Paper of the Parliament and a copy thereof shall at the same time be delivered to the Speaker. In this paragraph "citizen" includes a body, whether incorporated or unincorporated, if not less than three-fourths of the members of such body are citizens.
He brought to the cognizance of the Court that the President did not invoke the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court on the issue at that time when Bill was placed in the Parliament order paper.
He submitted that the 19th Amendment has now been enacted and no person can invoke the jurisdiction for a pronouncement on the Bill as under Article 124 which reads: otherwise provided in Articles 120, 121 and 122, no court or tribunal created and established for the administration of justice or other institution, person or body of persons shall in relation to any Bill, have power or jurisdiction to inquire into, or pronounce upon, the Constitutionality of such Bill or its due compliance with the legislative process, on any ground whatsoever.
He said if the Presidentwas aggrieved that his term of office is curtailed, he could have asked for a referendum.
He contended that a term of office can be reduced by a person holding office without affecting the sovereignty of the people but one cannot extend his/her term of office without going for a referendum before the people.
He said there is no question of law or fact or interpretation and it is not a matter of public interest and it is used for political benefit.
Ali Sabry PC, Uditha Egalahewa PC, Kalyananda Thiragama, Krishmal Warnasuriya, and Viran Corea also appearing for different Intervenient petitioners Prof. Tissa Vitharana, Wimal Weerawansa, Centre for Policy Alternatives, Dr.Gunadasa Amarasekera, Keerthi Tennekoon of CaFFE, made similar submissions.

Shape of hand reveals the owners character
	

The shape of the hand provides a wealth of information relating to the character and the peculiarities of the subject, say great palmists who have done research and gathered knowledge through practice of the science.
The hand as a whole is divided into three distinct parts as:
(1) Hand Proper
(2) Fingers and
(3) The Thumb.
(1) The Hand Proper (back) extends from the wrist to the lower knuckles of the four fingers.
(2) The Fingers: Four in number. Each finger is divided into three phalanges, the first or the nailed one, the second and the third connecting the Hand proper.
(3) The Thumb consists of two phalanges only. The lower portion of the Thumb is attached to the wrist and it is also one of five metacarpal bones forming the Palm proper. It is not a phalanx. Readers have to note that the Hand as a whole is the back of the hand from the wrist to Finger tips. Palm is the inside of the hand from the wrist to the base of the fingers.
There are seven types of Hands each with a specific shape. They are:
(1) Elementary or primary hand
(2) Square or the useful hand
(3) Spatulate hand
(4) Philosophers hand
(5) Conic or artistic hand
(6) Psychic or idealistic hand
(7) Mixed hand
The Elementary hand or the Primary hand:
As the names suggest is the lowest of all types. It is characterized by stiff thick fingers. A clumsy thumb, the nailed phalange turned back, a hard palm and shapeless finger tips. The hand as a whole is short and thick.
Owners of the Elementary hand possess little mental development and hardly any skills developed by brain. They fit into occupations requiring unskilled manual labour. They have a violent temper and are unable to bridle their passions. They are like animals guided by instinct rather than by reason. They have no ambitions and are quite contented if they have enough to eat and drink and sleep.
The Square or the useful hand:
This type of hand is called `square because it is more or less square in shape. Even the nailed phalanges of fingers of such a hand are square. The thumb of the Square type is often long, well-shaped, set high on the palm and stands away from the palm.
People with this type of hand are pragmatic, logical and materialistic. They are solid serious workers, not idealists or visionaries.
They are said to be narrow-minded and are respecters of the letter of the law. They are firm and resolute in their views, especially when their thumb is long and the first joint is stiff.
We can recognize this type easily when we look at the back or the reverse of the hand. There are several knots on the fingers of this hand.
The Spatulate or the Necessary or the Workmans hand:
This hand is usually crooked or irregular looking with large finger tips. The nailed phalanges of the fingers of the spatulate type present the appearance of a flattened out spatula.
People with this type of hand are untiring persistent workers full of energy and drive. They are innovative, unconventional and emotional.
Unlike the Square type, the Spatulate type possesses much imagination. They do not sit idle and stare while the world passes by. Even if they are born poor, they would eventually rise to a high position by the dint of perseverance
The Philosophers hand:
Long, bony and angular with knotty joints and is fairly thin. People with this kind of hand are great readers with a propensity towards literature. They love sedentary work and a solitary and austere lifestyle. As a rule, the line of Head on such hands is rather sloping. People with this type of hand rarely amass as much wealth as those with the Square hand do. The Philosophers hand symbolizes a high mental plane of the humankind.
Conic or Artists or artistic hand:
This type of hand is soft, supple and tender and is graceful in appearance. The fingers are thin, long, artistic and well formed. The owner of this type of hand may not always be a painter or any other artiste. But he would have emotional and artistic temperament and the love for beautiful surroundings. He is most sensitive to colour, music, and all fine arts. The Head line and will power shown by it would determine whether the subject would develop his inborn talents into full flowering. They are true connoisseurs of art and if for some reason they fail to become practicing artistes, they would spend a greater portion of their wealth on artistic pursuits. From a worldly point of view, these persons are failures in life as they live in a world of fantasy. However, if an artists hand is not supple and little stiff, he would acquire wealth and fame by means of his artistic skills.
Psychic or idealistic hand:
This type of hand represents the highest developed mental stage of man. But this type does not represent success from a worldly point of view. This type of hand is generally supple and well formed. These graceful hands do not appear to have been made for any kind of manual work. People with type of hand develop psychic powers. They are mostly idealists and dreamers who are not adequately equipped mentally and physically to deal with problems in life in practical terms.
Mixed hand:
This type of hand shows a mix of characteristics of other types, but this type cannot be treated as belonging to any of the types we have so far discussed. Renowned palmists say that they have often found some hands with the four fingers different from one another. For example, one finger may be pointed or conical and another square or spatulate and so on.
Owners of this type of hand are versatile, but they fail to master any of the trades they try their hand at. In other words, they are like the proverbial jacks of all trades and masters of none.
It is only when the line of Head is clear and straight, is there the likelihood of a person with a mixed hand making a success of his life.

They dislike her  sermons on morals
	

This film actress has now taken to politics in a big way and the leaders of her political party expect her to be a star attraction at their propaganda meetings.

Nowadays she is often seen addressing pocket meetings in the city suburbs to win over voters for the party candidates contesting the upcoming local polls.
However, the crowds at these meetings begin to thin out no sooner this actress starts addressing them, they say.
Some inquisitive ones who had observed this unusual crowd-reaction claim that the people attending the meetings begin to leave one by one or in groups as this fair one, well-known for her libertine lifestyle has of late made a point to wax eloquent on our traditional cultural and moral values. People detest her hypocrisy. Therefore, they leave the meeting to register their protest, one of them explained.

## Title: When your eye becomes lazy!

When your eye becomes lazy!
	


All of us like to laze around now and then. But what happens when your organs start becoming lazy too Your eyes, your window to the world in particular, could become lazy. However what we call the lazy eye is far from the fact that your eye is voluntarily too lazy to do its job. Lazy eye also known as amblyopia is yet another condition that could burden weakened vision. Dr. M Wijetunge, Retired Consultant Eye Surgeon from the Ragama Teaching Hospital, spoke to the Health Capsule regarding Amblyopia.
Lazy eye is a condition that occurs as a result of the brain suppressing the actions of an eye which is already weak. This will enable the patient to use only one eye for vision. Since the other eye will mostly be disregarded by the brain and not used in the perception of images, it becomes the lazy eye. This eye disease creates a weakening in vision of your eyes to a certain extent, explained Dr. Wijetunge.

Blocked by the brain
To further clarify this condition, he stressed that while the vision of one of your eyes will start weakening due to a couple of reasons, the vision in your other eye will remain normal. Your brain will only sense and respond to the signals sent by your good eye. The signals sent by the weakened eye will be suppressed by the brain. So patients will only be able to see through their good eye and not with the eye affected by amblyopia. This does not mean that the lazy eye is completely blind. The patient is able to see through that eye to a certain extent though good vision is hindered. Amblyopia affects just one of the two eyes in most cases. However there are instances when both eyes are affected by amblyopia, informed Dr. Wijetunge.

Variety in laziness
According to the eye surgeon, there are 3 types of amblyopia. They are strabismic amblyopia, sensory deprivation amblyopia and isoametropic amblyopia.
He explained that strabismic amblyopia may occur secondary to strabismus. Strabismus, also known as squint eye, is yet again another vision related condition which can pave the way for amblyopia.
Next we come to the second type of the lazy eye condition known as sensory deprivation amblyopia. This type of amblyopia plagues a person when light is unable to enter the eye and stimulate the retina of the eye, Dr. Wijetunge stated. Therefore vision will weaken in that eye, which becomes the lazy eye, while the other eye will function as normal. This type of amblyopia can attack and hinder a persons vision if a patient is suffering from cataracts, according to the doctor. 
Finally, we come to the third type of amblyopia, which is known as isoametropic amblyopia. This causes a lazy eye (or lazy eyes) following refractive errors in the eyes giving reason to poor sight. Refractive errors that impact your vision include astigmatism, hypermetropia and metropia among others. As mentioned previously, lazy eye usually affects just one eye, but Dr. Wijetunge added that when a patient suffers from conditions like cataracts or big refractive errors in both eyes, both eyes will be subjected to amblyopia. 
So the reasons for amblyopia can be listed as eyes suffering from strabismus, eye cataracts and refractive errors.

Are their symptoms
Dr. Wijetunge mentioned that there arent any specific symptoms that would set off alarm bells regarding amblyopia apart from the fact that there is weakening in your vision, either in one eye or maybe both. 
Amblyopia is often diagnosed during eye check ups for other vision related problems. For example, when examining a small childs eye for strabismus, amblyopia might be a threat and when it is detected, they are able to undergo treatment to prevent further aggravation. In the case of a squint eye, the good eye will be patched up. The patient is to use the defective eye to see which will not allow the brain to suppress the signals from that eye as the good eye will be covered (and thereby unable to see) and the patient will only be able to see objects with the defective eye. This corrects the lazy eye. This is known as squint observation therapy, he stressed. Likewise when you visit your eye consultant especially when you suffer from the above risk factors, you will be treated in a way that amblyopia can be prevented if it hasnt struck your eyesight yet.
Risk groups 
It is important to note that more small children are prone to developing lazy eye compared to adults. After the ages 9-10, amblyopia cant be treated or cured easily. The suitable ages for lazy eye to be treated is during the ages of 3-4, he pointed out. So it is important to detect this threat at a small age and follow appropriate treatment as directed by your eye consultant to avoid amblyopia in the future. 
However it should also be said that amblyopia does not harm the eye in anyway. Dr. Wijetunge stated that the eyesight in the affected eye will be hindered to a certain extent, but the eye isnt harmed or blinded. 
Best option
Getting the eyes checked at ages 3-4 is the best option as amblyopia can easily be cured or prevented at younger ages. So if small children face any of these risk factors such as squints, inability to see long or short distances or have the sign of eye cataract it is important to seek medical attention. In that case, through use of spectacles and other treatment, amblyopia can be prevented, he concluded.

Women should not suffer from PMS
	

How many times have you used the phrase, Sorry, I must be PMSing, to escape a tough situation where you acted irritably or unfairly. But how much do you actually know about PMS Did you know, for example, that while around 20 to 30 percent of the women of fertile age are reported to be suffering from this condition, actual figures are believed to be higher To obtain more information about this well-known condition that still has many obscure areas, the Health Capsule consulted Dr. U.D.P Rathnasiri, Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist of the Castle Street Hospital for Women. 

Definition
PMS, short for Pre Menstrual Syndrome, stands for a condition where a series of psycho-somatic symptoms which occur prior to menstruation in a pre-menopausal woman. The term psycho-somatic is used because the issues that a woman suffering from the condition will undergo can be both physical as well as mental. These symptoms could appear at anytime from the point of ovulation to the starting of menstruation. 

The cause
A womans body experiences hormonal variations each month with her menstrual cycle. These changes are especially highlighted after ovulation, which is the process of releasing of the unfertilized egg by the ovary. These changes bring about physical and emotional changes, which give rise to these symptoms. 


How do they present
Physical symptoms could present as headache, breast tenderness, bloating, fluid retention, joint pain, lower abdominal pains and cramps and other non-specific symptoms which give her pain. 
Psychological problems most often present as mood changes. Irritability, feeling down and depressed, lack of interest in things she normally enjoys, loneliness, agitation and lack of sexual desires can happen during her period due to the hormonal changes. This could further go on to affect adversely on the persons day-to-day life, keeping them away from normal activities, school and jobs due to severe symptoms. 
All these symptoms can be roughly categorized into mild, moderate and severe. 
PMS is a disease very specific to the reproductive age group of women, and its been found that the symptoms increase closer to the menopause in middle aged women. Another bad effect of PMS is that in addition to altering moods, it also worsens preexisting conditions like depression, and asthma. 
When should we seek medical treatment
This depends on various factors like how severe the problem is and how much it affects your day-to-day life. Most patients with mild symptoms do not need medical treatment. Sometimes just a simple analgesic may bring relief. But patients with severe disease will benefit from seeking specific treatments. 

Treatment
Treatment is not for everyone. First we have to confirm that these symptoms are due to PMS and not related to another underlying cause. Usually, if the symptoms appear for at least three cycles, we can consider that its due to PMS. Treatment is not the same for everyone and has to be tailor-made for the need of the individual. Sometimes a painkiller like Aspirin, Ibuprofen, and Diclofenac Sodium may benefit. 
At other times she may need hormonal treatment like Oral Contraceptive pills. They prevent the process of ovulation; the release of the egg from the ovary, preventing most symptoms of PMS from occurring. 
Specific symptoms that trouble the patient will also be addressed, like giving Diuretics to reduce bloating, and prescribing antidepressants in case of severe mood alterations. Pre-existing conditions that are aggravated by PMS, like asthma, will have to be addressed separately. 
In the condition called, Pre-Menstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD), which is the severe form of PMS, the symptoms affect the patient in a way that her activities of daily living cant be continued. In this case, they will need treatment earlier and more severe types of treatment like a combination of treatment. In place of Oral Contraceptive pills, we also prescribe more advanced treatments like GnRH analogues, which prevent ovulation at the brain pituitary level. These drugs cant be continued long-term, but will be effective in most cases. 

Is medication the only option
Sometimes, supplementation using vitamins and alternative medicine like Ayurveda and acupuncture may work with some women. At other times engaging in activities like yoga, exercises and medication may help. Incorporating some form of relaxing activity that provides distraction from focusing on the symptoms like dancing or gardening for example have known to be beneficial. 
The important thing is to continue with whatever that proves beneficial, rather than alternating treatment frequently to find relief. 

Final message
Women should not suffer from PMS. They should seek help. Help does not always mean medication. It may mean emotional support, engaging in uplifting activities, not being isolated and changes in lifestyle, exercise and weight loss. As I said, this disease as well as the treatment that works is individualized in each case. The important thing is to know that treatments are available and to find out what works for you.
