Ignorance of fmr govt placed SL on collision path: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said despite the integral role played by Sri Lanka towards the establishment of the UN in 1945, the ignorant attitudes of certain politicians and other officials of the previous government placed Sri Lanka on a collision path with the international community, which in turn stalled the countrys journey forward.
The PM made these remarks a short while ago in his address at the event held this morning at the UN Compound in Colombo, to mark twin anniversaries - the 70th UN day and the 60th year since Sri Lanka became a member state of the UN.
Sri Lanka was a globally reputed state and made a significant contribution towards the establishment of the UN. Unfortunately, we did not receive due recognition towards those efforts and that itself was a major setback, he noted.
PM Wickremesinghe pointed out Sri Lankas political leadership since obtaining UN membership in 1955 has been working closely with the organisation and thereby won a special place in the international community.
He criticized the decisions made by certain politicians and officials of the previous regime that resulted in Sri Lanka embarking on a collision path with the international community.
The former regime believed that if they allied themselves with states that did not see eye-to-eye with nations that challenged the state of affairs in Sri Lanka, it would help them overcome the issues that arose on an international level, he said while adding, The former regime aspired for Sri Lanka to lead the beggars of the international community and thought that it would help fight off battles with powerful nations, failing to understand that it is not the way in which diplomatic relations play out. . .
Meanwhile the PMs sentiments on the way in which Sri Lankas relations with the UN and its agencies deteriorated during the past few years were reflected in the speech made by President Maithripala Sirisena as well.
He pointed to the way in which a Minister of the former regime challenged the UN by staging a sathyagraha before the UN compound in Colombo and the manner in which such actions were encouraged by the former political leadership when he fed refreshments to the protesting Minister who was on a hunger strike.
It was such actions that deteriorated the cordial relations between the UN and Sri Lanka. The new government for the past ten months has been making efforts to control that damage and rekindle and restore the relations to its former state, he said while adding the GoSLs actions since the beginning of this year, has been aimed towards making it clear that Sri Lanka is a nation that takes its duties and obligations to the international community seriously.
He also commended the media and communications outreach campaign that has been launched titled Our UN. <U+0D85><U+0DB4><U+0DDA> UN. <U+0B8E><U+0B99><U+0BCD><U+0B95><U+0BB3><U+0BCD> UN to mark the celebration of the twin anniversaries and noted that it would create the necessary mindset within the masses to become one Sri Lanka.
UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative Subinay Nandy in his address appreciated Sri Lankas renewed engagement with the UN and all its partners. He added the trust and cooperation borne out of the new relations was culminated in the recently passed UNHRC resolution on Sri Lanka.
The event this morning was attended by top level UN as well as GoSL officials and Sri Lankans who held high ranking positions in the UN. The distinguished attendees including UN Assistant Secretary General for Political Affairs, Miroslav Jenca who is currently in the island on a four-day official visit. He delivered the statement by UNSG Ban Ki-Moon. Among other guests were Minister Mangala Samaraweera, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, Dr. Radhika Coomaraswamy, Minister Rauff Hakeem and Dr. Jayantha Dhanapala. (Lakna Paranamanna)

Kadawatha-Kerawalapitiya section on OCH gets green light
	
	Cabinet approval has been granted to complete the construction of phase three of the Outer Circular Highway connecting Kadawatha to Kerawalapitiya, the Road Development Authority (RDA) said.
	RDA Project Director of the OCH phase three N.K.L. Netthikumara said the interchange proposed to be constructed on the Peliyagoda  Puttalam road would be removed because an interchange has already been constructed in Kerawalapitiya.
	This section of the OCH from Kerawalapitiya to Kadawatha is to be completed with four lanes similar to the phase one and three of the expressway, he said.
	The initial works of the 9.32 km stretch are underway and it is scheduled to be completed by 2019.
	The Cabinet had approved the contract of the third phase to the Metallurgical Corporation of China Ltd. (MCC) at a cost of Rs. 66.69 billion in 2013.
	Considering the high cost in the project and the recommendations made by professionals, the scope of works was reviewed with a reduction of cost by 35.9% i.e. Rs. 23.93 billion.Accordingly the expressway section is to be constructed with four lanes, reducing the length of viaducts and height of viaducts.
	However, as the contractor had disagreed on these amendments, the construction of that section of the expressway has been delayed. A report on possible changes without compromising safety aspects has been obtained from the construction supervision consultant and the two major changes to remove one interchange and to construct the phase three with four lanes has been made.
	Consequently, the proposal made by Lakshman Kiriella, Minister of University Education and Highways, to implement the project with these changes was approved by the Cabinet.
	Earlier this year the government appointed a three-member committee to review the project and reduce its cost.(Dharsana Sanjeewa)

SL makes compensation plea in UN climate pledge
	
		 		 
		 
			
Sri Lanka submitted its new climate action plan to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
This Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) comes in advance of a new universal climate change agreement which will be reached at the UN climate conference in Paris, in December this year.
This INDC and all others submitted by countries are available on the UNFCCC website here. Including Sri Lanka, 156 parties to the UNFCCC have formally submitted their INDCs. The UNFCCC secretariat provides relevant background data for Sri Lanka in the PDF below.
The Paris agreement will come into effect in 2020, empowering all countries to act to prevent average global temperatures rising above 2 degrees Celsius and to reap the many opportunities that arise from a necessary global transformation to clean and sustainable development.
UNFCCC Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres is encouraging countries to come forward with their INDCs as soon as they are able, underlining their commitment and support towards this successful outcome in Paris. Governments agreed to submit their INDCs in advance of Paris.
All information such as documentation on designing and preparing INDCs as well as on sources of support for INDC preparation, is available here.
Countries have agreed that there will be no back-tracking in these national climate plans, meaning that the level of ambition to reduce emissions will increase over time.
In 2004, a calamitous tsunami killed an estimated 36,000 people as 30-metre high walls of water lashed its low-lying coastal plains.
Sri Lanka is largely affected with climate induced extreme weather events and slow onset disasters, read its national contribution to a global warming treaty due to be finalised in December.
Losses and damages (L&D) due to these disaster events are heavy, creating a huge pressure on the economy and public spending.
Government disaster relief stood at US$130 million between 2007 and 2011. Officials fear the bill could grow as global warming makes intense storms or failed monsoons more likely.
Sea-level rise menaces Sri Lankas tourism and fishing industries, and the export of agricultural produce, the document warned.
Some threats can be reduced with investment in sea defences or drought-resistant crops, for example. Officials calculate $420 million is needed for climate-proofing over the next decade.
Yet inevitably, there will be impacts people cannot adapt to. Sri Lanka is rallying with its low-lying cousins to force climate changes wealthy culprits to pay out damages.
For the developing country of 20 million people, which emits just 0.1% of global greenhouse gas emissions, it is a matter of fairness.
Sri Lanka intends to join hands to develop a fully-fledged Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage to address the loss and damage issues and in parallel develop an appropriate local mechanism, reads a highlighted box in the climate pledge, or INDC in UN lingo.
That is a tall order. Rich countries have pushed back on the vexed issue, worried they would be opened up to a litany of lawsuits. Analysts forecast that loss and damage will get just a fleeting mention in a new climate agreement.
Envoys from 195 nations are crafting a new global warming treaty to be finalised in Paris in December. National pledges form the backbone of the deal.
Sri Lankas plan outlines greenhouse gas cuts to play its part.
It plans to shave 7% off forecasts of future emissions in 2030. That can rise to 23% with help from international partners.
While its energy demand is on track to double within 20 years, it said it will tackle a dirty transport system which belches half of the energy sector emissions.
It plans greener vehicles, enhancing its public transport system and laying electric railways.
Biodiverse rainforest and mangroves, which cover 30% of the country, will be increased to 32% to act as carbon sinks.
