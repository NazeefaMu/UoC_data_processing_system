Fire engulfs ancient 'heart' of Tibetan Buddhism
	
A large fire has damaged one of the holiest and most politically sensitive sites in Tibet, the Jokhang temple, stirring an outpouring of grief and concern among Tibetans, the Guardian reported.
Dramatic picture posted on social media showed flames devouring part of the seventh-century Unesco world heritage site in Tibet?s spectacular high-altitude capital, Lhasa, on Saturday.
China?s Communist party-controlled news agency, Xinhua, said the blaze started early on Saturday evening ?and was soon put out?.
However, Robert Barnett, a London-based expert on contemporary Tibet, said Beijing?s ?almost total suppression of information? about the incident meant many Tibetans feared ?the heart of Tibetan Buddhism? had suffered significant damage.
For almost four hours after the fire began, he said, it was not even acknowledged by China?s heavily controlled media, ?even though you could see it from miles away across the whole city?.

There were anywhere from 60 to 100 people on board the domestic flight, media in Iran are reporting.

Witnesses told local media that it appeared the plane was trying to make an emergency landing on a pasture before it crashed.
A crash site was found near Semirom in Iran's central Isfahan province, but a rescue helicopter was unable to immediately land due to bad weather.
Rescue teams were sent to the site to search for survivors.
However the rescue effort was hampered by the remote location of the crash site and dense fog.
Reports stated that it was impossible for ambulances to reach the mountainous site, so teams had to be sent in by helicopter.
There were conflicting reports on the number of passengers and crew on board, with some media putting the total at about 60 and others at 100.
Aseman Airlines is the third largest carrier in Iran and is based in the capital Tehran (Mirror.co.uk)
