Science faculty of Jaffna Uni. closed after student clash
	
A clash between two student fractions on Saturday closed the Science faculty of Jaffna University until further notice. ?
The National University Teachers? Association (NUTA) said the fight had erupted due to a cultural performance at a welcome party held for freshmen at the Science faculty.
The Association said that students of the Arts Faculty had opposed the event and later attacked the students of the Science Faculty, during the programme.
Close to 20 students were hospitalized with injuries. NUTA Secretary Dr. Channa Jayasumana said several students had returned to their homes under police protection.
?After some students of the Science Faculty performed a cultural event in welcoming the new comers, some students of the Arts Faculty suddenly came and attacked them. A few minutes later, some outsiders who are said to have been called by the Arts Faculty students, entered the university premises with helmets and clubs. That group consisting of about thirty men attacked the students of the Science Faculty and the students who performed the cultural event,? he said.
He also said the Science Faculty students had agreed to hold two cultural events at the welcome party, therefore the intervention of the students from the Arts faculty was irrational.
Dr. Jayasumana said the students from the Arts Faculty had also threatened the Science Faculty students.?? ?
?We strongly condemn the violent actions of some of the students. We urge the authorities to look into this very serious matter and take immediate action to defuse the situation so that students can resume their studies,? he stated.
He also said the academic staff of the Jaffna University had been informed of the issues developing between the student fractions but no action had been taken. (Piyumi Fonseka)

SL Navy denies attacking TN fishermen
	
The Sri Lankan Navy today denied allegation by the Indian Fishermen?s Association of attacking Tamil Nadu fishermen in the seas off Kachchathivu Island last night.
Quoting the leader of the Association, P Sesuraja, the Indian media reported that four Tamil Nadu fishermen suffered minor injuries when they were attacked, allegedly by Sri Lankan navy personnel.
According to reports, the fishermen, part of a group of 3,000 who had put out to sea from Rameshwaram on Saturday night, returned without a catch after the navy officers threatened them for fishing in the island nation's territorial waters, he said.
?The navy personnel took away their cell phones and GPS equipment and also damaged the nets of 10 other boats,? he said.
Navy Spokesman Captain Akram Alavi denied the allegation and said they would never attack the Indian fishermen or damaged their equipment. ?We only arrest the fishermen who illegally fish in Sri Lankan waters. The Indian fishermen?s associations make such false allegations on a regular basis,? he said.(Darshana Sanjeewa)
