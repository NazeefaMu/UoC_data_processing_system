ComBank hosts Lankans in exchange houses in Qatar
	
The Commercial Bank of Ceylon recently felicitated a group of Sri Lankans employed in exchange houses in Qatar in appreciation of their role in popularising the Bank?s remittances services in the state.
The event at Grand Mecure Hotel in Dohawas attended by more than 200 Sri Lankans who were treated to fun activities, musical entertainment and an opportunity to interact with each other in a relaxed atmosphere.
Qatar, which employs approximately 125,000 Sri Lankans, is a key market for Commercial Bank?s remittance products. Considered to be among the top five remittance corridors to Sri Lanka,Qatar has a substantial expatriate worker population and 20 exchange houses to cater to the money remitting requirements of this workforce. Commercial Bank currently has four Business Promotion Officers stationed in the country.
Commercial Bank is one of the most active players in Sri Lanka in the field of remittances, offering customers a range of options including ?e-Exchange? ? the Bank?s own sophisticated real-time on-line money transfer service, as well as the MoneyGram, Ria and Express Money remittance services.
One of the Bank?s key strengths is its island-wide network of 250 branches, many of which remain open on public, bank and mercantile holidays, and its network of 625 ATMs, which is the largest automated cash dispensing system owned by a single bank in Sri Lanka. Recipients of remittances sent to the Bank enjoy many benefits such as over 60 holiday banking centres and super market counters, a dedicated customer support call centre for remittances and SMS alerts facilities once the remittance is received and is ready to be paid out.
The only Sri Lankan bank to be ranked among the Top 1000 banks of the world for five consecutive years, Commercial Bank operates a network of 250 branches and 625 ATMs in Sri Lanka. The Bank was ranked the most valuable private sector brand in Sri Lanka in 2014 and has also won multiple awards as Sri Lanka?s best bank from a number of international publications over several years. The Bank was adjudged one of Sri Lanka?s 10 best corporate citizens by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce in 2013 and 2014.
Commercial Bank?s overseas operations encompass Bangladesh, where the Bank operates 18 branches and Myanmar, where it has a Representative Office in Yangon. In September 2015, the Bank received regulatory approval for the establishment of a fully-fledged Tier I Bank in the Republic of Maldives. The Bank also received license to operate a fully owned Money Transfer Operation in Italy recently.

Finance Ministry can't implement ACR fee: Bandula
	
The Finance Ministry did not have the authority to introduce the new Annual Company Registration (ACR) Fee under the Companies Act, the Joint Opposition said yesterday.
Addressing a media briefing, Joint Opposition MP Bandula Gunawardane said the new registration fee would be annually implemented on private companies with a fee of Rs. 60,000.
?For public companies the fee is Rs. 100,000 and for listed public companies the fee is Rs. 500,000,? he claimed.
?These companies had to pay this fee before the end of March, but many of those companies will not be able to pay it and now the payment period had been extended to end June,? he added.
He said the local companies had rendered helpless due to this condition;
?Nearly 5,000 companies had been shut down with the newly introduced company registration fee,? he added.
He said such levies could only be done by the Company Registrar under the Companies Act of 2007.
He said the finances charged by the Company Registrar were earlier centered as 2/3 for the Companies? Fund and 1/3 for the Consolidated Fund under the Company Act.
?However, at present, 100 percent of the finances were claimed for the Consolidated Fund. Only the Company Registrar is authorised to do it,? he said.
He said as the Joint Opposition, they vowed to the local companies that they would curtail this registration fee up to an amount less than Rs. 15,000, when they again came to office.
Meanwhile, he said that he preferred the participation of these entrepreneurs to the Joint Oppositions? actual Anti-tribulation May Day rally, which would be held at Kirulapone. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

HSBC yields to shareholders on pay as flags Brexit danger
	
?? ?HSBC changes pay policy for executive directors
	?? ?Change follows shareholder pressure over pay
	?? ?Shares in HSBC down 1.4 percent at 1215 GMT
	?? ?Follows investor pay activism at other FTSE firms?
REUTERS: HSBC changed its pay policy for executive directors on Friday, bowing to shareholder concerns triggered by a drop in the bank?s share price and worries over its dividend.
The overhaul of HSBC?s pay, which it said would lower the maximum amount its executive directors could earn by 7 percent, follows investor revolts at BP and Anglo American over remuneration policies.
Europe?s biggest bank told shareholders at its annual meeting in London on Friday that it would cut the amount of cash given to executive directors in lieu of a pension from 50 percent to 30 percent of their base salary.
It will also make long-term incentives subject to a three year forward-looking performance period, in line with other FTSE companies.
At the meeting, 96 percent of shareholders who voted approved the new measures which had been proposed earlier.
?We had expected that the Remuneration Policy you approved back in 2014 would not need to be refreshed until it expired next year,? Chairman Douglas Flint told them before the vote.
?However, regulatory changes as well as responding to shareholder feedback have caused us to make some revisions to this,? he said.
HSBC also said it could be forced to restructure its wholesale operations in the UK if Britain voted to leave the European Union in June?s referendum.
?Our own economic research is very clear about the advantages of Britain being at the heart of a reformed EU,? Flint said. ?We believe that the UK would enter a period of great economic uncertainty in the event of a vote to leave.?
?
U.S. license
Flint said the bank was doing everything it had promised to do to avoid the loss of its U.S. banking license, following alleged failures to impress a monitor supervising a reboot of its anti-money laundering (AML) compliance program.
In 2012, HSBC was fined $1.9 billion by the U.S. government, who said it had become a ?preferred financial institution? for drug cartels and money launderers.?
and had conducted transactions for customers in several countries subject to U.S. sanctions.
?The DOJ (Department of Justice) in its most recent letter would echo that although HSBC has made significant progress, the bank continues to face significant challenges in implementing AML prevention,? Flint said in response to an investor?s question at the meeting.
?So we have work to do but at same time, the DOJ said that, overall, HSBC continues to take significant steps.?
The chairman also sought to play down the bank?s links to the ?Panama Papers? scandal, which exposed the role played by scores of global banks in helping clients hide wealth in secretive offshore companies.
Flint said that less than 5 percent of 2,000 offshore structures it helped to create still existed.?

NPC not for special powers: Sivagnanam
	
The Northern Provincial Council (NPC), which has reiterated the position of Tamil parties for a merger of the North and the East, is not for special powers to be provided to the proposed State, according to its chairperson C.V.K. Sivagnanam.
On the significance of the resolution adopted on Friday, Mr. Sivagnanam has told The Hindu that ?our demand for federalism should not be misconstrued as something in favour of separatism. Let the Central government share power with all the Provinces uniformly. We expect other Provinces to fall in line with us so that we all can have greater powers.?
The Council?s proposals on constitutional reforms were essentially based on the constitutional models of two countries ? India and Switzerland.? In the case of India, there should be States demarcated on the basis of languages. This was one of the reasons for the proposed merger of the Northern and Eastern provinces as ?Muslims in the East are all Tamil speaking people,? Mr. Sivagnanam pointed out.
Conscious of the pluralistic character of the Eastern province where the population was more or less evenly distributed among Tamils, Muslims and Sinhalese, the NPC chairperson said for getting the support of the Muslims, the resolution talked of creating an autonomous council. Taking into account aspirations of hill-country Tamils, the NPC suggested another autonomous body.
The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) has 30 members in the 38-member body.

PHU to President: Dissolve NPC
	
The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) today requested the President to dissolve the Northern Provincial Council (NPC) and take the administration under his purview because it had passed a Bill calling for the merger of the Northern and Eastern Provinces and federalism.
PHU general secretary, Udaya Gammanpila MP, said that if President Maithripala Sirisena really loved the country and wanted to show that he was capable of taking straight decisions he should dissolve the NPC.
?Otherwise, he should summon the chief minister of the Northern Province and severely warn him not to take arbitrary decisions hereafter. This is not the first such resolution passed in that Council. When the then Chief Minister Varadharaja Perumal declared Tamil Eelam, President R. Premadasa dissolved the Council,? he said at a media briefing at party headquarters.
Saying that both the president and the premier were still silent on the issue, he requested the president and the government to launch a programme to ensure national security.
He said federalism was not an option when devolving power but a means of bringing several independent nations together. ?The US, Canada, Germany, Australia, India and Pakistan were federated to keep different independent countries together -- not to divide one nation,? he said.

The Higher Education Ministry has instructed university authorities to explore the possibility of setting up a system outside their purview, as in India, to entertain complaints by freshers subjected to ragging, Minister Lakshman Kiriella said yesterday.
Mr. Kiriella told Daily Mirror that an Indian academic had, at a recent seminar, outlined how the Indian Supreme Court had ordered the setting up of a mechanism whereby aggrieved students could complain to an authority outside the university system.
?India has a non-governmental authority to hear the complaints. Complaints can be lodged online. We have asked the universities here whether it is feasible to have a similar system here,? he said.
He said, ?Today, students are reluctant to complain to the Vice Chancellors. They find it embarrassing to do so. A non-governmental authority outside the university system was discussed recently at a seminar". (Kelum Bandara)

A Sri Lankan housemaid, who has been held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia since 1999, without being paid for more than fifteen years amidst physical harassment by her employer, has been given her salary in arrears and brought back to the country, Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) officials said.
The woman, aged 44, a resident of Muvunuwatawana, Chilaw was brought back to the country two days ago by the SLBFE.
Murine Jasintha went to Riyadh when she was 29, on an SLBFE registered working agreement.
After the SLBFE officials intervened into the matter, the employer had agreed to pay her dues Rs. 2.7 million in arrears for fifteen years.
According to SLBFE sources, the woman was not allowed to get in touch with her family members after two months after she started working.
It is also reported that she had not been given meals properly and she had often faced physical harassment by her employer.
However, she had managed to escape from the employer?s place and sought refuge at the Sri Lankan Embassy in Riyadh.
?Our Mission in Riyadh summoned the employer and informed him about the possible legal action against him unless he paid the wages in arrears.
?He accepted his fault and agreed to pay the workers dues for fifteen years. She was given Saudi Riyal 68, 000. No legal action was taken against him therefore,? an SLBFE official said.
Ms. Jasintha is currently waiting at the SLBFE Sahana Piyasa welfare centre in Katunayake, until her family members arrive to take her home tomorrow. (Piyumi Fonseka)

President Maitripala Sirisena said he would not have accepted the chairmanship of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) had he had any foreknowledge of the harassment he would be subjected to when running the party's affairs.
Addressing a political meeting in Ambalangoda on Saturday, he said he assumed that he would receive the same degree of cooperation enjoyed by the party?s past leaders when he was elected to the post, with members having raised both hands.
?Yet, as the SLFP leader, I am ready to stand up to these harassments. When I was relaxing at my residence after being sworn in as president, 20-odd SLFPers came to me and asked me to accept the party leadership. I was taken aback. I had been surprised when I was chosen as the common opposition candidate for the Presidential Election. Disciplinary inquiries were pending against me. I inquired what former president Mahinda Rajapaksa would do about my taking up the chairmanship. They told me that Mr. Rajapaksa?s concurrence was secured prior to offerring the leadership to me,? he said.
Mr. Sirisena said he had sought a verbal assurance from Mr. Rajapaksa.
He said the party should be built up properly before forming a government. However, he asked whether the people needed a new government. He said there were a lot of things that should have been done during the post war period.
?Unless we do them now, the eruption of another war will be imminent,? he said.
He stressed the need for a national approach to prevent northern youths taking up arms again.

With US economy in soft spot, Fed likely to keep policy on hold
	
AFP: Persistent worries about the global economy and the possibility of Brexit -- Britain?s pullout from the European Union -- will probably keep the Federal Reserve on hold this week as it reviews interest rates.
The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee will also be buying time to be sure the US economy picks up from a modest first-quarter slowdown and more unexpected weakness in inflation, analysts say.
Minutes from the FOMC?s March meeting and speeches by Fed officials show the group is divided between those who think another increase in the benchmark federal funds rate after December?s is appropriate now, and those who want to wait.
But analysts say the heavier hand of dovish Fed Chair Janet Yellen together with Brexit, the still-simmering Greek crisis and other worries about the international economy should keep the balance against an increase.
The FOMC meets on Tuesday and Wednesday, its third meeting of a year that began with expectations of a possible four rate increases to take the Fed funds rate to 1.25-1.50 percent by year?s end.
But after the deep turbulence in international financial markets at the beginning of the year, and then some weakness in US consumer spending and business investment clouded the growth picture, expectations were lowered to just one or two quarter-point increases this year. ?Following an unexpectedly dovish turn by Chair Yellen last month, it seems to be a done deal that the Fed will leave its interest rate unchanged,? economist Harm Bandholz of Unicredit said.
Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics agreed.
?The Fed is very unlikely to raise interest rates at the upcoming FOMC meeting,? he said. ?Nevertheless, we expect the Fed to leave the door open to a rate hike at the next meeting in mid-June.?
?
Slower growth outlook
The meeting comes amid a debate inside and outside the Fed about whether the US economy is insulated enough to withstand more volatility in global financial markets and continued slow growth around the world.
The International Monetary Fund cut its outlooks for world and US growth last week, citing significant outstanding threats, including regional conflicts and Brexit.
Economists are also cutting their expectations for US first-quarter growth, with Unicredit penciling in a very slow 0.5 percent annual pace.
Against that, the Fed has to weigh positive signs such as continued strong hiring that is boosting household incomes, and the dollar?s recent fall, which will buoy exports.
The minutes to the Fed?s last meeting show some advocating an earlier rate hike to ensure the Fed does not miss the boat when inflation picks up.

?I don?t see how they would feel confident enough that they could signal June is likely, given that the outcome of the Brexit vote won?t be known until after the June FOMC meeting,? he said.
