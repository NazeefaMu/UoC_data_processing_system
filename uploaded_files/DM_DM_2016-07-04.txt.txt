Beleaguered big shot in a last ditch battle to discredit probe report
	

A team of officials, of a key government institution, who probed a key issue has submitted a report containing a damning indictment on a white collar bigwig with close ties to a leading politician. And the bigwig is now reportedly carrying out machinations aimed at compelling the probe officials to retract their indictment.

Incidentally, the white collar bigwig has come in for severe flak from various sections of the enlightened public for various acts of commission and omission on his part. 
The bigwig has also made a well-planned bid to get a responsible high up of the department concerned to make a public statement saying that the damning report had been issued without the unanimous approval of the probe team, they say.

Politics, economics mixed up in SL: Indrajit
	
The new Central Bank Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy, who assumed duties today, said politics had mixed up economics ever since the country achieved Independence.
Ever since this country gained Independence, economy has been mixed up with politics. I dont want to point the finger at any party but just want to emphasis that politics and economics have been mixed up by all governments. But I would like to stress that good economic policies result in good politics, he said.
He said he would work straight and fear none.
When I met President Maithripala Sirisena, he advised me to work straight and fear no one. I will follow his advice and work straight and fear no one, he said.
He said the Central Bank should not engage in creating artificial economic booms but make sure the economy was stable.
Dr. Coomaraswamy recalled his meeting with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as well.
When I met the Prime Minister he read out the vision he has for the country and there is a big role for the Central Bank to play. If we do not work the way we should, the country will not be where it should be. Strong macroeconomic stability is essential. If that does not exist nothing can be done, he said (Yohan Perera)

The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) today reiterated that none of its members were behind the arrest of its former member and MP Udaya Gammanpila and urged him to prove if he was innocent without blaming the JHU and its members for no reason.
JHU National Organiser Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said Mr. Gammanpila was making hate-filled statements directed at JHU members especially at Party Secretary and Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka.
Gammanpila is trying to cover up his wrongdoings and frauds hiding behind nationalism and Sinhala Buddhist concepts. He preaches against imperialism but his family members live in imperialistic countries. He was arrested not because one of us made a complaint but because one of his old friends - Lasitha Perera, he told a news conference held at the party head office in Battaramulla.

The National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ) today welcomed the appointment of Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy as Central Bank's new Governor and requested him to uphold the institutions transparency which was lacking during the former governors tenure.
NMSJ Convener Professor Sarath Wijesuriya said Dr. Coomaraswamy was a professional and it was a surprise to note the delay in his appointment.
We wonder why it took so long to appoint the new governor when we have credible intellectuals like him in our country. We wish him well and hope he can provide the proper management that the CB requires. He will have to face many challenges ahead due to the financial crisis in the country, he said.
Professor Wijesuriya said Dr. Coomaraswamy should learn lessons from the Bond sale scam and take measures to prevent the repeat of such incidents and also should resist political influences. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

US- SL relations at a historic high: US embassy
	
The United States Embassy in Sri Lanka in a release commemorating the Independence Day of the country, said that the relations between Sri Lanka and the US are at a historic high.
Ambassador AtulKeshap in his statement observed that he was constantly reminded of the common principles our two countries share that make us natural allies and partners.
In his statement he states that the US government applauds the dramatic transformation made possible by Sri Lankan voters, and we appreciate the governments efforts to uphold and protect fundamental freedoms.
Below is the full statement
U.S.-Sri Lankan Relations at a Historic High: July 4 th Message by U.S. Ambassador AtulKeshap
Each year on July 4th, Americans all around the world gather with friends and family to celebrate our Independence Day, honoring the date in 1776 when our countrys founders gathered in Philadelphia to imagine a self-governing democracy where all people, having been created equal, would be entitled to life and liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. In that era, our founding fathers boldly articulated that their American Dream would include fundamental liberties, including freedom of religion, assembly, speech, and association. Such audacious thoughts would lead Americans to overcome injustices like slavery and continue our progress towards, in the words of our Constitution, a more perfect union.
In my first year as U.S. Ambassador to Sri Lanka, I am constantly reminded of the common principles our two countries share that make us natural allies and partners. We applaud the dramatic transformation made possible by Sri Lankan voters, and we appreciate the governments efforts to uphold and protect fundamental freedoms. We support efforts to promote needed constitutional reform and national reconciliation so that all Sri Lankans can enjoy equal rights, equal opportunities, and the full benefits of post-conflict development and prosperity, regardless of their ethnicity or place of birth.
As fellow democracies bound by shared beliefs in universal freedoms, U.S.-Sri Lankan relations are at a historic high. Our Independence Day reflects our citizens' decision to determine their own choices and future direction. It was a victory led not just by visionary leaders, but by many of their fellow citizens who fought for these freedoms.
I see the same dedication in the Sri Lankan people as they seek to transform their country into a united, reconciled, peaceful, prosperous nation with equal opportunity for all, regardless of ethnicity or religion. Bound by our values and strong people-to-people ties, the United States has always stood with the people of Sri Lanka, and will work together with you to restore Sri Lankas rightful place as a democratic and peaceful nation, and a strong contributor to global prosperity and stability.
