Buying chicken at the heroin spot!
	
A State Lodge high-up caught in the company of two persons found packing heroin in packets, is said to have been released following intervention by a powerful politico from the South.
In a statement given at the cop shop, the State Lodge high-up had claimed that he had gone to the place where heroin was being packed into packets to buy chicken, but there had been no meat stall anywhere near this spot, they say.
The State Lodge high-up is a close pal of the Southern politico, they say.

Change in premiership - Upsets countries indifferent to polls delay: Dullas
	
It is deplorable to find the foreign countries and organisations, which remained silent about the delay in holding elections appearing concerned about the change of premiership, MP Dullas Alahapperuma said today.
He told a news briefing that the US State Department and the European Union (EU) had failed to issue a single statement about the delay in holding provincial council elections.
?The elections for six of the nine PCs had not been held but the US which remained indifferent to this violation of democratic right of the people are today urging us to reconvene parliament which is unacceptable. The removal of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the prorogation of parliament were done under the Constitution,? the MP said.
He said Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has called for a party leaders meeting on Tuesday and said it was unethical and illegal.
Commenting on reducing the security provided to UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe he said it was a wrong move.
?We believe there are some supporters of MP Sajith Premadasa who are against Mr. Wickremesinghe. Therefore, IGP Pujith Jayasundara should take responsibility for his security,? the MP said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Chickens coming back home to roost!
	
A former unpopular white-collar high-up of the august assembly, now serving a leading politico as the coordinating secretary had reportedly got an earful from a onetime subordinate of his at an evening function organized by the assembly employees.
?
This white collar one while working at the assembly had shabbily treated the male subordinates though he had always been fawning on the female employees, often going out of the way to do them favours.
He had received an appointment as the coordinating secretary of a leading politico following his retirement.
At the evening function, the white collar one had patted the back of a former subordinate and said howdy to him. However, the subordinate?s response had been an angry retort:
?When you were our boss, you glared at us even when we wished you good morning. At that, you were soft on girls and treated us like dirt?You are now giving us a pat on the back to show your goodwill?!???
The white-collar one had faded soon after suffering this slight, they say.

Constitutional Coup: How to save Sri Lankan democracy  ?
	
?
This is not the first time that the powers of the executive presidency that were deemed to be a source of stability were abused to serve the whims and fancies of the holder, effectively plunging the country into the depth of a political crisis. J.R.Jayawardene?s arrogance sowed seeds of a nation- wide political turmoil that overshadowed much of his second term, and Chandrika Kumaratunga?spalace coup in 2003 ingloriously ended her cohabitation government with the UNP.? Last Friday, the incumbent of the office of presidency went an extra mile to wreak havoc. President Maithripala Sirisena scandalously sacked Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and appointed Mahinda Rajapaksa, his one- time boss, then the nemesis and now again the friend, in the post of Prime Minister. Constitutionality of his action is hotly debated and is open to interpretation. However, military-grade secrecy that shrouded the whole affair raises serious questions about basic civility and morality of his action and of the man himself. His subsequent prorogation of Parliament betrays sinister mechanization, which are gradually taking practical expressions as of now.? ?
According to the Article 46 of the Constitution,?the Prime Minister shall continue to hold office throughout the period during which the Cabinet of Ministers continues to function under the provisions of the Constitution unless he?? ?
46. 2 (a) resigns his office by a writing under his hand addressed to the President; or? ?
(b) ceases to be a Member of Parliament ? or? ?
48. (2)?Parliament rejects the Statement of Government Policy or the Appropriation Bill or passes a vote of no-confidence in the Government.?? ?
Under such a condition, the President shall appoint a new Prime minister, who ?in the President?s opinion, is most likely to command the confidence of Parliament? (article 42 (4) and 48 (1) and the Minister of the Cabinet and Deputy Ministers .? ?
The legal opinion that supports the removal of Mr. Wickremesinghe is the interpretation that the departure of UPFA from national government on Friday, effectively ceased the function of the Cabinet of Ministers. Nonetheless, the practical question is whether the exit of the UPFA caused the Prime Minister to lose the confidence in Parliament. That can only be tested in a vote in the House. Instead, President Sirisena, who on two previous occasions within this year tried (and failed) to remove the Prime Minister, used this opportunity to appoint MR, as the Prime Minister.? ?
His action is contentious and polarizing at best, and undemocratic and unconstitutional at worst. He could still have mitigated the degenerative effects of the political crisis he himself caused, had he let Mr. Rajapaksa to prove that he commanded the most confidence in Parliament. He did not do that. Instead he prorogued Parliament. As a result, now there are two parallel governments.? ?
If he genuinely believes his Prime Minister appointee commands the most confidence in Parliament, the question of prorogation does not arise. In truth, UPFA even with the support of the CWC could command the support of only 97 members in Parliament. That is a long way from securing a working majority of 113. In comparison, the UNF has 106 MPs. There is also a crucial block of 16 MPs of the TNA who are more inclined towards the UNP than the Rajapaksas. The JVP which has 6 MPs has decided to remain neutral. A few of the UNP MPs could well sell their vote to the highest bidder. M/s. Vadivel Suresh and Ananda Aluthgamage have expressed interest in pole vaulting, though the former had since changed his mind.? ?
That is where the sinister logic of the prorogation comes to life. Prorogation is meant to buy time to secure a sufficient number of cross overs from the Opposition. Mahinda Rajapaksa has deep pockets and a chequred history of buying MPs. Any bribery commission worth its salt should investigate this insidious affair.? ?
The three week period until the convening of the House is now being put into to good use to capture the state and consolidate the grip in state institutions, often through the use of thuggery. The national television, Rupavahini went off air during its forcible takeover by the UPFA supporters. Editors and independent journalists of Lake House were terrorized and chased away during the weekend.? ?
Political violence that has been kept at bay for the last several years is raising its ugly head. Two men were killed on Sunday in a clash involving rival political groups. Rights activists, especially in the North are bracing for a new phase of state violence. Intimidation would further radicalize Tamils. Also a government that lacks constitutional legitimacy would find it hard to defend Sri Lanka in international fora.? ?
In his address to the nation on Sunday, the President made a lame effort to justify the sacking of the Prime minister. His speech was a load of loaded words and personal attacks and a practical explanation of his self-serving ploy. Nor did he explain how Mr. Rajapaksa whom he accused of manifold corruption, atrocities, and previously spoke of likelihood of he himself ending under six feet, had he lost the presidential election, suddenly become an ideal companion.? ?
Sri Lanka is in political turmoil due to the President?s selfish mechanization to secure a second term. He vouched in his inauguration speech not to seek another term and later changed his mind. He aspired to be the common candidate for yet another time. The UNP refused to accommodate him. Since then he began making overtures to the Rajapaksa acolytes in the Joint Opposition. The unsaid agreement behind his Friday ploy was that he would be the SLFP nominee for the presidential election supported by Mr. Rajapaksa, who in return gets the post of Prime Minister.? ?
How this gamble will play out is to be seen. For it to succeed, his constitutional coup should go unchallenged in court, in Parliament and outside. Second, MR should stick to his side of the bargain. Most likely, the President would be taken for a nasty ride by the shrewd Rajapaksa/s.
Whether Mr. Rajapaksa commands the confidence in Parliament is untested. Numbers suggest he does not. This in other words makes him an imposter of the office of Prime Minister -- Just like his pick of a Chief Justice, Mohan Silva, whom he appointed after he sacked legitimate Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranaike.?
International community has moral responsibility not to recognize his government unless or until , its majority in Parliament is proven in a vote. If that majority is achieved through extra-Parliamentary/ extra judicial means that would further erode his legitimacy. That the foreign envoys (except the Chinese ambassador who met both M/s.Wickremesinghe and Rajapaksa) have so far shunned Mr. Rajapaksa and President Sirisena betrays the reservation on the part of the international community. Irrespective of self -interested articulations of cave- minded patriotism by a few, the people of this country deserve the help of the civilized world, if their painstakingly achieved democratic reforms are to be defended.? ?
The game plan of the Joint Opposition, of which a captive the President has become, is clear. It could consolidate its grip through the state capture and lavish inducement for Opposition MPs to crossover. If it fails to secure enough votes, the President may be persuaded to prorogue Parliament again. At the end, the Vote on Account that the JO plans to present could well be defeated in Parliament. This would prompt the President to dissolve Parliament, leading to snap elections.
However, JO members appointed as the ministers of Rajapaksa government would have recourse to hold on to their ministerial portfolios, thus enabling them to utilize the state machinery for electioneering. Both Sri Lanka?s main parties have a track record of abuse and misappropriation of public property during the elections.? ?
Submitting an impeachment motion against the President would prevent him from dissolving Parliament. That would nonetheless further aggravate the political crisis since the UNP could not garner the two third majority needed for the impeachment of the president. Yet, that would tie the President?s hand.? ?
There is,however, a silver line. Institutions that had been empowered under the 19th Amendment could prove that they could tame the absolutism of a self- serving presidency. RanilWickremesinghe, Opposition leader R. Sampanthan and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake have requested the Speaker to reconvene Parliament. The Speaker should use the powers vested with his office and the doctrine of necessity to avert the further slide of the country into political chaos. That would enable the elected representatives of the people to resolve the current political crisis through a vote.? ?
The Speaker should act now. Time is fast running out. If he waits too long, democracy in Sri Lanka would bleed to death.?

Countrywide fuel distribution will be restored by Wednesday: CPPBOA
	
The Ceylon Petroleum Private Bowser Owners' Association (CPPBOA) yesterday said the countrywide the fuel supply would come to normal by Wednesday (31) evening.
The countrywide fuel distribution had come to standstill following the killing of a 34-year old man and injuring two others when one of the bodyguards of former Petroleum minister Ranatunga opened fire at a group of protesters at the CPC premises when the former Minister arrived on Sunday evening.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror CPPBOA Secretary Shantha Silva said the CPC had started issuing fuel yesterday at 6.00 p.m.
?Fuel bowsers were issued with fuel stocks as much as we could by yesterday. Remaining ordered stocks would be issued from tomorrow morning,? Mr Silva said.
Usually, fuel orders were placed two days before the finishing of the existing fuel stocks at filling stations.
In this situation, as the orders were placed, fuel had not been issued by the CPC due to the Trade Union strike which launched following a shooting incident at a group of protesters at the CPC on Sunday evening, he said.
Meanwhile, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Trade Union Collective had called off their strike yesterday following the arrest of former Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga.
Its Convener D.J. Rajakaruna said employees had immediately resumed work to ensure an uninterrupted supply of fuel. However, he stated that there would be a delay in supplies as only 30 bowsers could be handled per hour. ?Fuel supplies should be back to normal by tomorrow despite a slight delay.? Mr. Rajakaruna said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama and Indika Sri Aravinda)

The opening of an Osu Sala outlet in a main town north of the central capital is getting dragged on due to a tug-o-war between two rival politicos in the area, they say.
?
Arrangements have already been made to open an Osu Sala outlet in the town shortly on the initiative of a certain politico in response to a long-standing demand by the public, who are now compelled to buy their medicines at exorbitant prices from the private sector, but the politico occupying the main chair of the local body is yet to give the official nod for the purpose, informed sources say.
The chair of the local body is deliberately withholding his official, okay just to spite the rival politico, these sources add.

Or you can smile because she lived??
As I once again sit down in a far away land to write a few words in fond remembrance on Aunty Norma?s birthday, thoughts flow fondly of my dear mother-in-law Norma de Silva.? ?
She was a loving wife to Uncle Joe the wind beneath his wings as he always says and such a great mother to her children and to their spouses.She was a mother who taught her children love and kindness, gave them strength and gave her best to all.? ?
Aunty Norma was always kind and caring and had time even for a quick chat with the market vendor, the butcher and the green leaves seller who would come to her door.? ?
She had a strong faith that gave her the strength even in difficult times.? ?
Family was very important to Aunty Norma and I remember how every Sunday she used to have a sumptuous meal for all. One wonders how she managed to do it all those years with her busy social life. But I know that Aunty Norma and Uncle Joe cherished those family gatherings each week and those memories will remain treasured with all of us.? ?
Even at her grandchildren?s birthday parties she would be right in the middle of it trying to organize the games.??
Aunty Norma?s influence could be seen in the manner in which her children live their lives. You have shown them that above all riches, family is the most important and I am privileged to be part of this family.? ?
They say memories are golden well maybe that?s true. So another birthday, another year gone so soon and time goes so fast. Memories of you will always stay treasured.?

If Vote on Account defeated - Prez can dissolve Parliament: Wijeyadasa
	
Newly-sworn in Education and Higher Education Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said today President Maithripala Sirisena had ?inherent powers' to dissolve Parliament in case the Vote on Account to be presented by the new government was defeated.
He told a hurriedly summoned news conference that the foremost task of the new government was the presentation of a Vote on Account to appropriate finances for the operation of government for an interim period.
The minister, who was one of the four UNP MPs to join the new government of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, said the President had such powers to dissolve Parliament without waiting for four and half years under conventional practices enshrined in the Westminster System.
?If the Vote on Account is not approved by Parliament, there will arise a situation where the government is unable to function. The President can opt to dissolve Parliament to resuscitate the country from an anarchic situation. That is not a written law but a conventional practice,? he said and added that in the alternative the President could dissolve Parliament only after four and half years of being formed.
?105 UNP MPs were elected at the 2015 elections. If there is a snap general election it will be reduced to 40 or 50,? he said.
Kandy district MP Ananda Aluthgamage who joined the government from the UNP told the news conference that enough and more MPs would join the new government and added that as a new comer to the UNP he was disillusioned with the party within a couple of months.
He was sworn in as the State Minister of Tourism and Wildlife. (Kelum Bandara)

Looming political crisis pushing country into uncertainty
	
The uncertainty currently prevailing in the political climate in the country is not only killing but also dangerous. Both the United National Party (UNP) led by Ranil Wickremesinghe and the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) led by President Maithripala Sirisena and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa are laying claim to the government, after Rajapaksa was sworn in by the President on Friday in a dramatic and surprising move.? ?
This situation has led to the supporters of the two parties to attempt to hold on to or capture power in various government institutions, as we have already witnessed in the State-owned media institutions and the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC). Added to this is the possible showdown over the premises of the Temple Trees, the official residence of the Prime Minister of the country.? ?
Needless to say the only way out is to weigh the power both groups claim to wield in the Parliament and accept the outcome. But it is 17 days far away, as the Parliament session has been prorogued until November 16, within which anything is possible. It is inferable that the President has prorogued the Parliament in order for Mr. Rajapaksa to buy time to muster power sufficient to show that he commands the confidence of the Parliament, as required by the Constitution. But, it is a legal decision.? ?
Whether it is legal or not, ethically correct or not, the intervening period is so crucial in terms of peace among the masses. Also the situation would be further chaotic in the event Parliament decides against the President. Hence, the main stakeholders of the current conundrum must prove that they are responsible, matured and respected leaders. They must bridle the possible black sheep within their ranks.? ?
Another serious matter is that the minorities in the Parliament are becoming the decisive factor in sorting out the power struggle in the House. Already all eyes are on the individual members and the leaders of the minority political parties in the Parliament, despite many southern politicians always having a habit of demonizing them. The UNP seems to be depending totally on the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and the UPFA is trying to woo individual members, if not for the leader of other Tamil and Muslim political parties.? ?
The minority parties becoming important at this juncture is serious not because of any possibility of minority representatives of the House getting advantage of the situation for their personal gains or to win over their political demands, rather it is serious because they are gaining importance and going to decide the fate of the two groups at a time when emotions are running high in the majority community.? ?
With the initial changes at the helm that created the current imbroglio, already some sort of fear seems to have started to creep into the minority community circles, especially the Muslims. It is obvious, given the developments and their own political decisions during the recent past which was their sovereign right though. On the other hand, the leaders of the Tamil and Muslim communities that live in the southern parts of the country seems to be in a catch 22 situation, given the circumstances that led to the current poser which was elucidated by the President in his address to the nation on Sunday and the mindset of their constituency, that would decide their fate at the future elections.??
They might have definitely been confused by the fact that anything might happen at the confidence vote in the Parliament when it meets. Therefore, the situation demands more farsightedness on the part of those leaders of the minority political parties.??

No need for Prez to consult Speaker: GL
	
The joint opposition said yesterday there was no need for President Maithripala Sirisena to consult the Speaker when proroguing Parliament.
SLPP Chairman G.L. Peiris said the power to prorogue Parliament belongs to the President under the Constitution.
?He is under no obligation to consult the Speaker,? he said and added that Parliament was prorogued to give adequate time for the new government of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa to prepare a vote of account to run the government for up to March 31, 2019.
Prof. Peiris said though a fully fledged budget could not be prepared within such a short period and pointed out that some thing similar happened when a new government was formed in 1994.
He said the Speaker had been suddenly awakened suddenly on this matter though he remained silent when PC elections were delayed. (Kelum Bandara)

Now EU urges Prez to reconvene Parliament
	
A day after the US called on President Maithripala Sirisena to immediately reconvene Parliament, the European Union (EU) said the President should allow the immediate reconvening of Parliament.
This was expressed by Maja Kocijancic, Spokesperson of the EU Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/European Neighbourhood Policy and Enlargement Negotiations Division.
In a statement on Monday, she said the sudden deterioration of the situation in Sri Lanka over the weekend puts the country at risk of instability and unrest.
She said, along with other key international partners of Sri Lanka, EU Ambassador met on Monday with President Maithripala Sirisena to express EU?s expectation that a solution respectful of Sri Lanka's constitution would be found quickly.
?To this end, it is important that the President allows the immediate reconvening of the Parliament so that the elected representatives of the Sri Lankan people can fulfil their duties. In the current context of tensions and uncertainties, it is of utmost importance that violence and provocation are avoided and that law enforcement agencies act with restraint. The EU expects Sri Lanka to pursue its positive path towards reconciliation and democracy for the full benefit of the Sri Lankan people,? she said.

PC polls: Neither here nor there
	
A Supreme Court determination will be sought by the Election Commission on its role against the backdrop of the government's repeated failure to hold provincial council elections, EC Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said yesterday.
The last straw on conducting the elections was the recommendations of the five-member committee chaired by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
?The two-month deadline time given to the committee lapsed on the 28th. But committee member Prof. Balasundaram Pillai said recently that he had compiled a report which could be be gazetted if necessary,? he added.
Mr. Deshapriya said the EC needed at least three weeks to prepare the legal documents for the motion to be filed in the Supreme Court and another two months to prepare for the elections in the even that the SC directs the EC to hold the elections.
He told a news conference that the UNP and several other parties were keen to hold PC polls under the previous electoral system while the SLFP with some other parties were insisting that the elections be held under the new system.
?Parliament must approve one of the systems to hold the PC elections,? Mr. Deshapriya said.
He said he had written several letters to political parties represented in Parliament but none of them had given a firm response.
?All of them are agreeable to holding the elections as early as possible but none of them says how and when,? Mr. Deshapariya said and pointed out that the delimitation review committee was a failure having met only twice with no fruitful discussions being held and died a natural death on the 28th.
He said according to the 2018 electoral register, the number of voters had increased to 15,993,490 from 15,762,830 voters in the previous year.
?We are faced with a situation where a considerable number of households had indicated their reluctance to register as voters,? Mr. Deshapriya said and added that EC was in touch with the government to initiate a mechanism to introduce the Electronic Voting System (EVS). (Sandun A Jayasekera)

He said holding the much delayed PC polls would be another step forward by the government to strengthen democracy and protect the franchise of the people.
Addressing the government?s ?Wap Magu' ceremony at the Sandagirigoda paddy field at Tissamaharama yesterday the President said officials of the six PCs were without direction and guidance right now owing to the absence of political leadership.
?The government is keen to find solutions to the grievances of people in the North. Those who were in the government during the past three and half years failed to find solutions to them. Finding a solution to the housing problem in the North was restricted only to Cabinet discussions," he said.
The government was committed to achieving a robust economy while providing relief to the people. At the same time the government was also committed to protecting national interests. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Sri Lanka?s forgotten  links with Kerala
	
?
Kerala, linked to both Tamil-speaking North and Sinhalese-speaking South is hardly talked about
?
Colombo, October 29: Generally speaking, when people and politicians in Sri Lanka and India talk about India-Sri Lanka cultural and historical ties, only Tamil Nadu, Bengal, Bihar and Odisha are mentioned.
Tamil Nadu is linked to Tamil-speaking North Sri Lanka, and Bengal-Bihar and Odisha are linked to the Sinhalese-speaking South Lanka.
But an area in India which is linked to both the Tamil-speaking North and the Sinhalese-speaking South is Kerala. But this is hardly mentioned.
Kerala?s links with both the Tamils and the Sinhalese of Sri Lanka have been obliterated by political expediency, with the Lankan Tamils wanting to link up with Tamil Nadu (Where there is sympathy for their cause) and the Sinhalese wanting to reach out to North India and the Central Indian Government in New Delhi, by stressing their relations with North India from where came their religion, Buddhism, and their highly Sanskritized language, Sinhala,came.
If Kerala comes into the picture at all, it is only when the subject is landscape, dress or food, where the similarity is striking.
But, as former Indian High Commissioner in Sri Lanka, Nirupama Rao says, the matrilineal system, temple art and temple observances, bind Keralites with North Lankan Tamils.
?The houses in Jaffna are modelled in Kerala style. The renowned Kandy Perahera has a lot of similarities with the Trissur Pooram Festival. The influence of Kerala could be seen in Kandyan dance as well,? she says.
According to the Lankan social anthropologist, Dr Gananath Obeysekere of Princeton University, at least a part of what is thought to have come from Tamil Nadu, may have come from Kerala, because in ancient times, the Tamil country comprised what is now Tamil Nadu and Kerala.
The Chera or Kerala Kings were powerful influences in the Tamil country in India from pre-Christian times to about the 3rd century AD.
The influence of the Cholas of the Western Coromandel Coast in Tamil Nadu on Sri Lanka became pronounced only from the 10th century AD onwards, Obeysekere says.
In his 2004 monograph: The Matrilineal East Coast, Circa 1968
Obeysekere looks at the Sri Lanka-Kerala link through the ?Pattini? cult and the matrilineal system.
In the Pattini Cult, the deity Kannagi is worshipped as the Mother Goddess, and in the matrilineal system, inheritance and residential patterns follow the female line.
Both the Pattini cult and the matrilineal system came from the Chera or Kerala area.
The Pattini cult is found throughout Sinhala society in South Sri Lanka and in the Tamil areas of Batticaloa and Amparai on the South-Eastern coast.
The matrilineal system is the norm in Tamil and Muslim societies in East Sri Lanka.
According to Dr Obeysekere, the matrilineal system existed in the Sinhala-speaking South also but was supplanted by the patrilineal system.
The Pattini cult
The story of Pattini or Kannagi is found in the 3rd Century AD Tamil Classic Silapadikaram located in the Chera or Kerala country.
The heroine of the story, Kannagi, in a rage over the wrongful execution of her innocent husband Kovalan, plucked out her breast and threw it into the city of Madurai, which then burst into flames and was destroyed.
Kannagi?s fidelity towards her husband and her fight for justice elevated her to the position of an ?Amman? or Goddess, and a powerful one at that.
Vanchi, which the Silapadikaram mentions as the ancient capital of the Cheras, was then a popular centre of trade with West Asia.
Its trade was in the hands of people who followed heterodox religions like Buddhism and Jainism. And Silapadikaram, a Jain Classic, was written by a Jain ascetic, Ilango Adigal.
Dr Obeysekere says that it was the Tamil-speaking Kerala Buddhist traders and other immigrants from the Vanchi area, who brought the Pattini cult to Sri Lanka.
He points out that according to Lankan mythology, the Pattini Cult was founded by King Seraman (The King of Kerala).
In Lanka, the cult was given high status when two trader families of Kerala origin, namely, the Mehenavaras and the Alagakonaras began to dominate the Western and Central parts of the island from the middle of the 14th century onwards.
And as per an inscription dated 1344, the Alagakonaras had come from Vanchi around the year 1100.
The Pattini Cult spread in Sri Lanka with the increase in the power of the Alagakonaras and the Mehenevaras who had started off as court officials.
The Mehenavaras were influential in Dedigama and Gampola (near Kandy), while the Alagakonaras established themselves in Raigama and controlled the ports of Beruwela, Devundara and Weligama, on the Southern and South Western coasts.
According to Ibn Batuta, in 1344, the Alagakonaras controlled the area now covered by the Western, Sabaragamuwa and Southern Provinces.
Because the two leading families from Kerala were Buddhists, they elevated Pattini to a Bodhisattva (a Buddha in the making).
It is noteworthy that Pattini is the only female Bodhisattva in the Sri Lankan Buddhist pantheon. She was also made a guardian deity of Sri Lanka.
Pattini was formally recognized as a Goddess in Sri Lanka during the reign of Parakramabahu VI, in the 15th Century.
Interestingly, the king was related to the Mehenavara family.
Although originally a Tamil Cult, Pattini worship is not found in all parts of Tamil-speaking Sri Lanka.
It is a peculiarity of the Sinhalese and the Eastern Province Tamils, Obeysekere observes.
In South India also, the Pattini Cult is found only in present-day Kerala. There is only one Pattini temple in Tamil Nadu, though the anti-Sanskritic Dravidian movement there tried to revive the Pattini-cult.
A strong Kerala influence is evident even today among all the peoples of the Batticaloa and the Amparai districts, whether they are Tamils or Muslims.
Their social formations and their Tamil speech reveal a Kerala origin.
A comparison of social institutions between Kerala and South East Sri Lanka shows that the Tamils and Muslims of Batticaloa and Amparai districts had migrated from Northern Kerala, says Dr Obeysekere.
Matrilineal descent (tracing one?s descent through the mother) and the matrilineal clan, are the dominant modes of social organization among the Hindus and Muslims of North Kerala and Eastern Lanka, where the matrilineal clan is called kudi.
Obeysekere notes that Tamil and Muslim women of Batticaloa get a two-thirds share of the familial estate as dowry on marriage, showing the pre-eminent place of woman in these societies.
The other institution that the matrilineal Keralites and the Eastern Sri Lankan Tamils and Muslims share is Uxorilocal Residence-under this system, the man lives in his wife?s residence.
Matrilineal descent groups come into play in worship in Eastern Sri Lanka.
In temples and mosques, particular matrilineal clans elect the chief, called the Vannakar in the case of the Hindu temples, and Maraikkar in the case of mosques.
Among the Hindus, the clans have particular roles in the rituals connected with Pattini worship.
Since the Goddess Cults in South India are associated with curing of diseases and resistance to pestilence, the Pattini Cult in Sri Lanka is also associated with these.
Because of this, in the past, Muslims and Sinhalas also participated in the ?cooling? rituals of the Pattini Cult, Dr Obeysekere says.
The Sinhala elite of the Bintanna-Aluthnuwara area had marriage ties with the Mukkuvars, the dominant Tamil caste in the East, who were migrants from Kerala.

The phobia and mania associated with English
	
?
??No no no, you mean ?phone? not ?pone??, another prospective great orator gets humiliated in public and fears to utter the idiom again. Proper pronunciation of the English language has been emphasized by teachers and peers alike. Some tuition masters would take pride in teaching students British English and say its the proper English. However, this makes students even more alien to English, that has sadly become a tool in our society to climb the ladder of success. Whether it be a work place presentation or a classroom activity in the university or school, people fear speaking in English because their speech could be riddled with mistakes. Such an episode can be detrimental to the individual. It does not only reveal your skills in the language, but also exposes you socially and culturally.?
It would be foolish for one to deny that we do not need English because as a developing nation it is difficult to survive solely by using the mother tongue. We need the language to access knowledge and to build international ties.?
However, English no longer belongs to the British and has become a universal language, hence one can argue that it is time that Sri Lanka becomes open to a kind of English that is its own. The people of this nation are comfortable using a new variety of English when speaking and writing. Further, we must change our attitude towards the language and should know the history and politics that the tongue encompasses. To understand these ideas further Dr. Nandaka Maduranga Kalugampitiya, Department of English, University of Peradeniya and Madubashini Ratnayake,? Senior Lecturer and head of the? English Language Teaching Unit (ELTU), Faculty of Humanities & Social Sciences, University of Sri Jayewardenepura gave their academic perspective on this issue.?
Dr.Kalugampitiya touched on the history and the context of the issue, and said, ?We need to understand the position of the English language in Sri Lanka to get to the root of the issue. Compared to the other two languages used, Sinhala and Tamil, the English language is quite different in the sense that English came to Sri Lanka as the language of the colonizer, the language of the oppressor. Though the oppressor is no longer there the language is still associated with features such as domination. Hence in the Sri Lankan context there is much tension associated with the English language. Traditionally English has been the prerogative of a particular class in society, that is the elite class. However, English has changed now and has become a language that is more accessible to more and more people, a contrast to the situation two or three decades ago. More people speak more freely and they understand the usefulness of the language.? ?
?However, the language still remains as the property of a certain privileged class in society. Hence, making mistakes in English can be quite costly. It can have many negative consequences, as there is a notion that the English language isn?t a language that should be meddled with, mainly because of the sense of power associated with the English language,? he said.
The way you speak exposes your social position, your class, education level, personality and even your moral compass. Therefore, the way you pronounce English tells a lot about you, much more than your English language competence
Dr.? Kalugampitiya
?
?
Madubashini Ratnayake elaborated more on the background of this issue and said, ?We got English from the British who colonized us. We are shouldering much prejudices and issues because we were colonized. When we were colonized, the British made it quite clear, regardless of where they colonized, that the natives were the savages and the British were the civilized people. In everything that they did, even with their language, they worked towards reinforcing this concept. Taking an example from another field, we still believe that fair is beautiful. In post-colonial countries like India and Sri Lanka we are constantly selling fairness cream. Even within the language this concept follows; for example refer to black as sin, but as pure as snow. Hence, even in language we have put black into a position of inferiority and white into position of superiority.?
?Therefore, language is more deeply rooted in the way we view the world. We look at the world through language. Language is reality. when we look at this issue from a superficial stand point we believe that the British pronunciation is correct. Sadly, even fifty years after the British has left we are still trapped in this mindset. I still see advertisements that teach British English. Even TV channel hosts try to use a supposed, but rather terrible, British accent to show that their level of English is superior,? said Ratnayake.?
As a teacher of English, she showed how this issue impacts her students, or any student who is pursuing the journey of learning the language, ?As a teacher I believe that the issue relating to pronouncing English words is one of the most sensitive issues when teaching the language. When I teach a student to speak English, his or her level of English is obviously not going to be even close to be of the British standard. This is because it is not our mother tongue. But as teachers we are not aiming at that standard, but we are aiming at what we call the ?Sri Lankan accent?, where we have a way of talking that is very common among Sri Lankans who do speak English. Almost all the academics in universities in Sri Lanka, in the English Department, would be talking with a Sri Lankan accent. The sad thing is that those who have studied abroad and know some English, would not bother about working on an English or American accent. But those who have learned the language with much difficulty in another way might be thinking that this is the way to impress people.?
She also spoke about the attitude that students have, towards those who are learning the language, ?Generally when students who speak in Sinhala try to learn the language they are immediately subject to fun. If not openly, at least other students will look at each other with a smirk and that child who is trying to speak the language knows it, and very often he or she would stop talking. That is one of the basic problems we have in language teaching because they would rather be quiet than be laughed at. However, a language can only be learned efficiently through usage. But in Sri Lanka our culture is such, that we make fun of that accent. This is one of the most harmful things in our country. No young person likes to be laughed at. Personally, a person has to be past 40 to inculcate that ?I do not care attitude?. Young people hate to be laughed at. It is a sense of inferiority that all of us have internalised. It is worse that people think it is okay to laugh at someone who is trying to learn.? added Ratnayake.?
We look at the world through language. Language is reality. when we look at this issue from a superficial stand point we believe that the British pronunciation is correct. Sadly, even fifty years after the British has left we are still trapped in this mindset
Madubashini Ratnayake

Fear psychosis?
Dr.? Kalugampitiya explained about the fear psychosis behind pronunciation by saying, ?Pronunciation as opposed to writing, is more easily observed, hence what you say and the way you say it quickly registers in people. The way you speak exposes your social position, your class, education level, personality and even your moral compass. Therefore, the way you pronounce English tells a lot about you, much more than your English language competence.?
?But the mindset towards Tamil and Sinhala speech is rather different, it?s quite sad that some people believe that not speaking properly in Sinhala and Tamil is something to be proud of. Some people believe it exposes a positive attribute about themselves. this difference is because of the difference in power associated with each of these languages.?
?
?But when it comes to English you can never afford to make that mistake, because every mistake is going to cost you opportunities in life. This is why people are afraid to speak the language?.
?
I am not saying that to use broken English, but broken English at times is part of the journey of learning. A rigid attitude towards those who are on the journey will not help
Both academics portrayed interesting arguments on whether we should have our own variety of English or whether we should stick to the proper British English.
Dr.? Kalugampitiya argued by saying, ?That is a question at a philosophical level. For instance, if you consider old English we find that it is far different from middle English to modern English pronunciation. Hence, there is a growth in the language. Pronunciation has under gone much change over the years. If a person who speaks old English meets a person who speaks modern English, there is a 100% guarantee that they would not understand each other. Though the same language is being used, it would not be comprehensible to the two people in the different periods. Hence, connecting that analogy to this question one can argue that in our context the English language can undergo changes, and pronunciation is a key aspect that will undergo?change as well.?
Further, there are certain sounds in Sinhala and Tamil, such as the ?sha? sound that has got incorporated into Sri Lankan spoken English. Such changes have been coming gradually. If the majority of the people are pronouncing the language in a different way from traditional British English, in my opinion we should not prevent this change, because it is the natural process of change,? said?Dr. Kalugampitiya.?
Madubashini also presented her argument on this idea and emphasised on the writing aspect of the new or hybrid variety of English in the country. She said, ?English has dispersed so much around the globe, again due to colonialism, that now it is so decentralized and has become difficult to control. Despite absolute desire to control, people tamper with the language. This is truly relevant to creative writing. If we take some of the young African women writers like Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie they casually use African words within the English. The Indian English poet Kamala Das for instance broke the structure of conventional English as she believed it was her English. However, there must be a level of comprehension and uniformity in the language in order to reach out to people. Otherwise the whole purpose of language fails. The first objective of language is communication. Hence, there must be a balance between the level of uniformity in the language and uniqueness presented by the new variety of English. Further, post-colonial theory actually discusses many varieties of English rather than one type of English.?
She added, ?However I am not saying that to use broken English, but broken English at times is part of the journey of learning. A rigid attitude towards those who are on the journey will not help. People must be aware of the political issues of this language. It has always been a language of privilege?.?
?
We? must start with politics, if we are to be successful in getting some people to learn. Hence, before we teach English we must create awareness amongst the students about the politics of English. Otherwise it is hard for people to muster the courage to learn the language.?
She also voiced her concern about how this issue is not being discussed in society, adding ? However, there is one concern. Since the private education system is established so strongly in the country those ideas are not being expressed. It is either the teachers are not aware of this issue or they do not regard it worth discussing. This issue is being discussed at universities by their respective English departments. However, in general I do not believe that these ideas are in currency in our country. This is a bit worrying.?
Job seekers?and English?
They discussed a solution for this predicament and how to thereby eradicate the fear psychosis behind the language, Madubashini said ?My appeal is for two categories of people: for the people who are proficient in English to not be so smug about your level of English because it has always been connected to privilege. Thereby I urge them to learn to be open to those who are still learning to speak English. English is not a mark of intelligence. The second category of people are those who are on the journey of learning the tongue. I believe you should not fear talking in a less standardized way. This has been spoken at many conferences where we as a country should think of a different standard of English. Action should be taken to solve this problem. It would help? however if people reach higher levels of proficiency in English if they can. But we need to understand that rural areas do not have teachers with the same standard of English, that we find in the major urban cities. It is hard and unfair that job seekers expect that same standard of English?.
?
?If a person who speaks old English meets a person who speaks modern English, there is a 100% guarantee that they would not understand each other. Though the same language is being used, it would not be comprehensible to the two people in the different periods.
Dr.? Kalugampitiya? added, ?In my view, we need an attitudinal change. Many of us are under the impression that we must pronounce English in a way that British or American people do, where any deviation from that norm is a mistake. We need to educate people and raise awareness among people that language is always in a state of change and we as a nation should be open to it. If we could cultivate this attitude people will be open to the idea of a new variety of English. Having discussions with teachers and giving them a theoretical understanding about the situation will be the necessary first step, as they are the initial propagators of English and also to popularise Sri Lankan works of art in English that incorporate the Sri Lankan variety of English.?
Madubashini? concluded, ?English in Sri Lanka is about class and privilege. It begins with a change of attitude:? amongst those who are proficient in? English, those who are learning the tongue and in our media. This change is a change of heart, it is not something? academic. It is an emotional change that the who country has to undergo. We? must start with politics, if we are to be successful in getting some people to learn. Hence, before we teach English we must create awareness amongst the students about the politics of English. Otherwise it is hard for people to muster the courage to learn the language.?

the Unfolding  political crisis
	
Legal experts form opinions on whether the removal of?Ranil Wickremesinghe as Premier was constitutional or not

Last Friday (October 26), the country was taken by surprise when former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was sworn in as the new Prime Minister of Sri Lanka. The appointment was shrouded in secrecy and at the time of appointment Ranil Wickremesinghe hadn?t vacated office. Since there was no discussion, consultation or announcement of the President?s move before he made it, questions are raised and opinions are formed about this drastic change of Government and the head of state who played a major role in it.?
The citizenry of this country has only known of General Elections as the democratic avenue available to it to change a regime by exercising the right to vote. In view of the novelty of the circumstances and deep conundrum that the general public is left with, the Daily mirror? inquired into the constitutionality of this controversial situation by consulting experts in the legal field. Their opinions were mainly twofold.?
According to one group of the legal experts the??Daily mirror?spoke to, the present appointment becomes constitutional only when the Cabinet of Ministers ceases to function under the provisions in the Constitution and when the Prime Minister has lost confidence of the Parliament. They maintain that in the present instance, since the Parliament was not consulted, the purported removal is unconstitutional.??
Some other legal experts point out that Article 46 (4) implies that when the National Government ceases to exist, there cannot be a Cabinet with over 30 ministers, and therefore the Cabinet stands dissolved. They contend that this warrants the removal of the Prime Minister. The counter-argument is that the provision in question only requires that the number of Cabinet ministers be reduced to 30 and not the dissolving of the Cabinet. It is further argued that the end of the National Government isn?t a ground for the dissolution of the Cabinet as per the Constitution.
With uncertainty looming over who is now the Prime Minister, Parliament has been prorogued until November 16 in an evidently undemocratic move as pointed out in the following extracts:?
?
Appointment of MR as PM is unconstitutional
?
?
?Blatantly undemocratic to keep proroguing Parliament.?
?
?
Arguing that Rajapaksa?s appointment was unconstitutional, Attorney-at-Law Luwie Niranjan Ganeshathasan said, ?There can be only one Prime Minister at any given time, so for a new appointment to take place the one holding office must be removed in a manner provided by the Constitution. Article 42 of the Constitution gives the President the power to appoint a Prime Minister only when there is a vacancy. Article 42 doesn?t give the President the power to remove a sitting Prime Minister?.?
?
PM to be removed only by Parliament?
?The Prime Minister can only be removed by Parliament and Articles 46 and 48 of the Constitution make this clear. It should specifically be kept in mind that the 19th Amendment removed an explicit provision in the 1978 Constitution which allowed the President to remove the Prime Minister at his discretion,? he added.?
Dismissing the argument that the UPFA withdrawing from the coalition Government justifies the appointment of a new Prime Minister he stressed on the importance of considering the constitutional impact of the UPFA deciding to leave the National Government. ?The National Government between the UNF and the UPFA got constitutional legitimacy through a Parliamentary resolution, therefore there has to be a Parliamentary process by which the National Government stops being relevant for the purpose of the Constitution,? he said.?
?
Cabinet not dissolved
?The constitutional implication of the National Government between the UPFA and UNF ending is that the number of Members of the Cabinet of Ministers has to be reduced. This does not automatically mean that the entire Cabinet of Ministers ceases to exist. Changes to the members of the Cabinet of ministers doesn?t mean that the entire Cabinet of ministers ceases to exist. The situations in which the Cabinet of ministers will be dissolved are clearly mentioned in Article 48 (2) of the Constitution. The dissolution of the National Government is not one of them,? he said.?
?
Undemocratic to prorogue Parliament?
?This entire process has led to much instability in the country and right now we have two Governments. The situation has to be clarified as soon as possible. The only way to do this is by summoning Parliament and seeing who has the majority. This has to happen immediately. It is blatantly undemocratic to keep proroguing Parliament till the President?s side can coerce a majority,? he said.?
Asked how the new appointment should have been made, Ganeshathasan said that the Prime Minister should have been removed by Parliament before the President appointed the new Premier. ?This could have happened either by Parliament rejecting the Statement of Government Policy, Parliament defeating the Budget or Parliament passing a vote of no-confidence in the Government,? he said.?
?On the night of October 26, 2018 for the first time since Independence, Sri Lanka had a situation where Government power was being transferred in a manner that was clearly against the Constitution and against the idea of a peaceful transfer of power. Regardless of our political affiliations or ideologies as citizens of the country we should be very concerned about this. It is hard to imagine that a process like this will be good in the long-term health of democracy,? he added.?
?
?
?That is not how democracy functions?
?
?
?
?
Constitutional Law expert Dr. Nihal Jayawickrama said that prior to the 19th Amendment, Article 47 (a) empowered the President to remove the Prime Minister from office. ?That Article was repealed. The new Article 46 now states that the Prime Minister continues in office unless (i) he resigns, or (ii) he ceases to be a Member of Parliament,? he said.?
General rule of interpretation in Interpretation Ordinance (IO) does not apply to Constitution?
?However, the power to remove the Prime Minister may be claimed from two other sources. One is section 14 of the Interpretation Ordinance which states that ?In all enactments, for the purpose of conferring power to dismiss, suspend, or to reinstate any officer, it shall be deemed to have been and to be sufficient to confer power to appoint him?. This is a general rule of interpretation and will not apply to a law, including the Constitution, in which the power to dismiss is specifically granted or removed.?
??The other source is the new Article 47(2) of the Constitution which states that ?Notwithstanding the death, removal from office or resignation of the Prime Minister during the period intervening between the dissolution of Parliament and the conclusion of the General Election, the Cabinet of Ministers shall continue to function . . .?.? We do not know why reference was made in this Article to the ?removal from office? of the Prime when the previous new Article 46 expressly omitted the power to remove him. Perhaps it was faulty drafting. Perhaps it was intended that the President should have the power to remove the Prime Minister at any time after the dissolution of Parliament when the question of enjoying the confidence of Parliament no longer arises,? he said.?
?
No-Confidence motion survived??
?Article 42 (3) requires the President to appoint as Prime Minister the Member of Parliament who, in his opinion, is most likely to command the confidence of Parliament. This power is usually exercised following a General Election. In August 2015, Ranil Wickremasinghe was appointed Prime Minister because the UNP (or UNF) had secured the highest number of seats. More recently, he survived a no-confidence motion with an absolute majority of Members voting for him.? How then can the President now claim that Ranil Wickremasinghe no longer enjoys the confidence of Parliament??
He questioned as to whether the President has violated the Constitution. ?Can he remove the incumbent Prime Minister without any evidence whatsoever that he no longer enjoys the confidence of Parliament?? Can he, by proroguing Parliament, prevent Parliament from expressing its confidence either in the incumbent Prime Minister or in the Member he has purported to appoint to that office? That is not how democracy, which is the fundamental basis of our Constitution, functions.,? he said.?
?
?President has no discretion to remove Premier?
?
?
?
?
V.T. Thamilmaran, Senior lecturer at the Faculty of Law, University of Colombo asserted that the President does not have the discretion to remove the Premier. ?In any case discretionary power cannot go against the very purpose of the crafters of the 19th Amendment. The circumstances which warrant the removal of the Prime Minister are clearly spelt out in the Constitution after the 19th Amendment,? he said.?
Addressing the argument that if the President can appoint the Prime Minister he can remove him, he said that that was so under the original text prior to the 19th Amendment. ?Are you going to say it is still the same? Then what is the purpose of this amendment??
?You can argue that no where is it stated that the President cannot remove the Prime Minister. But his is not so because the original text in Article 47 (a) specifically said President can remove, but now it is no longer there,? he explained.?
He said the President should have asked the UPFA or JO to bring a no-confidence motion in Parliament. ?This is not about President exercising his power. It is about Parliamentary democracy. Therefore, it is for the opposition party in Parliament to bring a no confidence motion and test it,? he said.?
When asked about the argument that when the UPFA leaves the Government the cabinet stands dissolved, Thamilmaran said there was no such provision in the Constitution. ?Article 46 (4) is applicable only when deciding the number of ministers and to nothing else. It has nothing to do with the removal of Prime Minister or the powers of the President,? he said.?
?There is a maxim in law, that if you?re prevented from doing something directly you are prevented from doing it indirectly as well. So by asking another person to take oaths as Prime Minister you are removing the existing Prime Minister which is prevented by the law from being done directly,? he said.?
?
?
The Prime Minister can only be removed by Parliament and Articles 46 and 48 of the Constitution make?this clear
	When communication has been made that they are no longer part of the National Government, then the present cabinet stands dissolved
	The situations in which the Cabinet of ministers will be dissolved are clearly mentioned in Article 48 (2)
?
Constitutionality can be challenged in SC?
?There is now a proviso attached to Article 35 which deals with Presidential immunity under 19A. There is now no immunity with respect of anything done or omitted to be done by the President, in his official capacity. So an application can be made under Article 126. There is a clear case that any citizen of this country can go to the Supreme Court under Article 126 based on franchise and fundamental rights,? he said.?
Who is the PM??
Responding to the question as to who the Prime Minister is now, Thamilmaran said that Kelson?s Theory should be considered. ?The President is the Commander-in-Chief and is in a position to control. So according to this theory the President can appoint someone. But the Constitution restricts this power. Just because the appointment is undemocratic it doesn?t mean the President doesn?t have the power,? he said stressing that the President has used his powers undemocratically.?
?
?
?
The President must form the opinion whether another MP commands confidence of Parliament?
?
?
?Mr. Gunatilleke, Research Director of Verite Research, claims that the purported removal of Ranil Wickremesinghe is completely unconstitutional, and unambiguously undemocratic. He identified that the Prime Minister?s removal in the present case has to satisfy two conditions; first, the Cabinet of Ministers must cease to function under the provisions of the Constitution as provided by Article 46 (2) of the Constitution and second, the Prime Minister must lose confidence of the Parliament as provided by Article 42(4).?
?
Cabinet of Ministers must cease to function to remove PM
Speaking of the first instance, Gunatilleke emphasised that the word ?shall? used in Article 46(2) indicates that it is constitutionally mandated that the Prime Minister cannot be removed unilaterally by any person including the President, unless the instances provided by the two exceptions to this rule are satisfied (which are: if he resigns; or ceases to be a Member of Parliament). ?Since we know the Prime Minister has neither resigned nor ceased to be an MP, the Cabinet of Ministers must cease to function in order for it to be possible for the Prime Minister to be removed?
Parliament must lose confidence in PM to remove him?
Regarding the second condition, Gunatilleke stated that although when appointing the Prime Minister, the President is mandated by the Constitution to appoint a Member of Parliament who in the President?s opinion is most likely to command the confidence of the Parliament, the Cabinet of Ministers ceasing to function is not a sufficient condition to remove the Prime Minister, although it?s a necessary condition in the present case. He stated that the President must then form the opinion as to whether another Member of Parliament is more likely to command the confidence of the Parliament and that this opinion cannot be unreasonable and should be confirmed by the Parliament.?
?It is disputed whether the first condition, which is that Cabinet of Ministers ceased to function, was in fact met. It is however obvious that the second condition, which is that the Parliament losing its confidence in the Prime Minister has not been met, as Parliament has been prorogued, and deliberately prevented from confirming or denying the President?s opinion. This is an abuse of power under the Constitution.?
?
Appointment of MR as PM is constitutional
?
?
?Appointment and removal of PM is exclusively within the domain of the President?
?
?
?
Constitutional lawyer Chrishmal Warnasuriya pointed out that when the UPFA moved out of the National Government on Friday, the National Government consisting of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet formed under Article 46 (4) no longer existed. ?When communication has been made that they are no longer part of the National Government, then the present cabinet stands dissolved,? he said.?
When pointed out that there are no constitutional provisions stating that the Cabinet dissolves under such a circumstance, he questioned as to whether there were provisions in the Constitution stating the contrary- that the Cabinet was not dissolved. ?A Government comprises an Executive President who commands Executive Power together with the Cabinet of ministers of which the Prime Minister is a member. Article 46 (2) states that the ?Prime Minister shall continue to hold office throughout the period during which the Cabinet of Ministers continues to function.? So when the cabinet goes out the Prime Minister goes out,? he said.?
?Then under Article 42 (4) the President shall appoint as Prime Minister the Member of Parliament who, in the President?s opinion, is most likely to command the confidence of Parliament. He further explained that ?confidence of Parliament? is subjective. ?If the President thinks that the man with the loudest voice can command the Parliament, that?s his opinion. The Constitution doesn?t say anywhere how that confidence is measured,? he said.?
?According to my interpretation the appointment and removal of the Prime Minister is exclusively within the domain of the President. There is nothing in the constitution which says that its dependent on numbers of heads of Parliament,? he added.?
?
?
?What matters is President?s opinion about whether PM commands confidence of Parliament
?
?
?
?
Manohara De Silva, PC on the other hand stated boldly that the matter was perfectly constitutional. According to him, the moment UPFA walked out of the coalition, the National Government ceased to exist and therefore there cannot be a constitutional Cabinet of Ministers with over 30 Cabinet of Ministers.?
?
President can change Cabinet at any time?
?Given the breakdown of the National Government, the only way to have a Constitutional Government and Cabinet of Ministers is for the President to change the composition of the Cabinet of Ministers, which he is empowered to do at any given time under Article 43(3) of the Constitution.??
?
English Translation of the Constitution is incorrect
He pointed out that as per article 42 (4) of the Constitution, it is the President?s opinion as to whether the Prime Minister commands the confidence of the Parliament that matters. He further stated that certain people have only read the English Translation of the Constitution which is incorrect; if the Sinhala Version is referred to, they will see that the Prime Minister can be removed according to Article 48(1).
?
?
?Parliament can now remove MR if there is no confidence in him?
?
?
?
A similar view was held by M.U.M. Ali Sabry, P.C as he also asserted that the removal of Ranil Wickremesinghe and appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa to the office of Prime Minister was constitutional.?
?
?
If no National Government, no Cabinet warrants removal of PM
He stated that under the Sri Lankan Constitution, a Government is formed under Article 42, according to which a Cabinet of Ministers and a Prime Minister needs to be appointed. He added that according to Article 46 (5), the Parliament can decide the number in the Cabinet of Ministers if a National Government is formed. He recalled how a National Government was formed in this country on the basis of 2 letters submitted by UNP and UPFA. Now that one of the constituent parties of the National Government ? the UPFA has withdrawn its support, Sabry claims that there is no National Government.?
?If the National Government is no more, that means there is no Government. Then a new Government needs to be established. About what happens to the Prime Minister in this situation is clearly addressed by Article 46 (2) of the Constitution, which states that the Prime Minister shall continue to hold office during which the Cabinet of Ministers continues to function. Therefore when the National Government ceases to exist, the Cabinet, which was appointed premised on the National Government is no longer valid and thus by that very fact, the Prime Minister ceases to hold office.?
?
?
?
Up to MR to show confidence of Parliament?
Regarding the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa to the office of the Prime Minister, Sabry claimed that it is also completely constitutional because the President is vested with the power to appoint whoever in his opinion is the Member of Parliament that can secure the confidence of the Parliament as the Prime Minister under Article 42 (4).?
?It is up to the newly appointed Prime Minister to then go to the Parliament and show his numbers. The President has done his part and acted constitutionally. Now if the Parliament decides that their confidence doesn?t rest with the appointed Prime Minister, then a no confidence motion can be brought to remove him.?

They will always resist reform How Sri Lanka caught up in a downward spiral of bad practices
	
?
In the Constitution, the separation of powers must be far more rigorous than the illusory separation allowed in the present Constitution
?
How often do we hear the desperate cry: ?If only we could get some decent people into Parliament!?
The lamentable fact is that, as long as we have undemocratic political parties of the types that we now have, there are no obvious means by which concerned citizens would be able to influence the central oligarchies of any of these parties to refrain from sponsoring crooked and incompetent persons as candidates? for election.
Most Sri Lankans who have followed the politics of this country either by direct experience or by objective research of the relevant records would almost certainly agree with the assessment that, except for a few years of fairly responsible governance immediately after Independence, there has been a steady drop in the quality of the service provided by successive governments, with just a few bright spots here and there. The only indisputable areas of continual growth have been corruption and waste.
Our citizens know that the overall quality of the MPs elected over the past six decades has been badly wanting and deteriorating.
Their poor attendance and wasting of Parliamentary time in non-productive discussion and irrelevant personal attacks, instead of making constructive contributions to debates, can hardly be considered to be worthy of the billions of rupees that is spent by us annually on running the affairs of Parliament.
Moreover, Sri Lankan Parliaments have always been very lopsided because the legal profession is greatly over-represented at the expense of a more heterogeneous sampling of the population.
One sobering fact is that, though some candidates for election to Parliament may have a widely-accepted reputation for honesty before being voted in, too many of them, not long after being elected, set their scruples aside and put their hitherto relatively clean hands deep into the public till.
The most frequent excuse they have for this transformation into the ranks of the unprincipled is that they have to return the money that they had to ?borrow? originally to fund their election campaigns. This defence is downright untruthful because no campaign financing is ever reimbursed.
The ?repayment? is always made subsequently in kind by MPs (especially Ministers) by misusing the influence that goes with their position to extend commensurate favours to those who supported them financially or in kind.
Under the present party system, people have virtually no say regarding the candidates who are put forward to contest elections.
As mentioned in more than one previous article of ours over the past several years, it is the head of each political party and a coterie of self-serving henchmen, who generally decide on who shall be presented as the candidate of their particular party for a particular electorate or for the post of President.
This practice has now become so obnoxiously preposterous that, for example, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has arrogated solely to himself the right to decide who his party would put forward as the candidate for the next Presidential Election and it is expected that almost every MP in the SLPP would shamelessly comply with his ?decree?.
Looking at this phenomenon from another point of view, the five to six million voters who customarily voted for the SLFP (sic) are left with little option but to vote docilely for MR?s SLPP nominee or spoil their vote or stay at home or vote for the candidate of some other party.
The UNP is not much better. Instead of holding a secret Islandwide ballot of their electoral ?leaders? to vote on who they would like to put forward as their Presidential candidate, there is a self-sustaining cabal at Sirikotha that keeps on putting forward Ranil Wickremesinghe?s name or that of some other favoured person.
Once again, we see that the local leaders of the five to six million voters who usually vote for the UNP are left with not even a remote say regarding the selection of candidates for election.
To get this country back on a strictly straight and narrow course, we need to have a Constitution with features that will encourage those who want to help establish the Rule of Law and Good Governance to become MPs, either as independents or as party members chosen by a fair and transparent selection process.
However, if the framers of a new Constitution uncritically follow the common practice of adopting assorted features from the constitutions of other countries and prepare a Patchwork Document, the cure would turn out to be worse than the disease.
In a new Constitution, the separation of powers must be far more rigorous than the illusory separation allowed in the present Constitution.
A superior Constitution, worked out from first principles and enhanced by logically-consistent subsidiary laws that would provide for better selection of MPs and the establishment of reliable governance systems and procedures, with effective checks and balances, would go a long way to improve efficiency and cut down malversation.
What are the current norms to gain candidacy? Those who aspire to be their candidates must have most of the following ?qualifications?.
They must be related to the party chief or his close associates. They need not possess any educational or professional qualifications but must belong to the right race, religion and caste to suit the respective electorates. They need not be able to speak more than one of the national languages. They should have the ability to persuade business leaders and other rich persons in their electorates and even outside to invest large sums of money anonymously in their election campaigns in return for future favours requiring political influence (especially from those candidates who may be expected to win ministerial positions). They must have the gift of the gab and the ability to lie convincingly. They should have no qualms about doing anything improper or even downright wrong for the benefit of their party leader. They should have cultivated and built up a group of local supporters who would be available not only to help during election campaigns but both before and after, inside and outside the law.
Could one expect anything more than mediocrity or criminality from the bulk of those who are chosen according to these criteria?
Going by what we have briefly outlined in the preceding paragraph, there are a few specific legislative controls that would help greatly to reduce the autocratic powers of party oligarchies and diminish drastically the need for large campaign funds.
(1) Voters at the periphery should be required, area by area, to elect to their own Citizens? Committees (CitComs) persons who are well-respected locally. Aspiring CitCom members should be required to provide personal details, in a specified format, to substantiate their suitability to join the local CitCom. Whilst some black sheep would undoubtedly find a way of getting in, persons trusted by the local public would be bound to outnumber them.
(2) Political parties shall be obliged to nominate candidates to contest elections only if the latter are already members of CitComs.
(3) As corruption starts from the need for vast sums of money for campaigning, there shall be no pedestrian and motor-vehicle processions, meetings that cause disruption to the activities of the population, installation of huge hoardings, use of loudspeakers and so on, all of which would require a lot of funds acquired by present-day candidates twisting the arms of those with money or important business interests.
(4) Campaigning shall be by house-to-house visits during which the candidates will issue their personal data sheets to the householders.
(5) Campaigning at the Pradeshiya Sabha, Provincial Council and National levels can be done, without violence, noise and little expense by employing the CitCom members to form electoral colleges (much more representative than the US ones) to suit the level of election contemplated.
Item 5 in the above paragraph needs justification.
Most voters presently cast their ballots like automatons for candidates based solely on vague emotional considerations and not by comparing party policies on national issues.
Consequently, the utopian idea that one-voter- one-vote should apply indiscriminately to CitComs, Pradeshiya Sabhas, Provincial Councils and Parliament is just an exercise in academic self-delusion.
It stands to reason that if a thousand voters have elected ten members to a CitCom, the members of the CitCom would, on the whole, be very likely to be better informed on all aspects of governance and national priorities than the bulk of primary voters, who would ordinarily cast their ballots without studying any of the issues that would be relevant to the election concerned.
The unpalatable truth that we have to face is that very few of our representatives - past, current or future - will want to formulate a better Constitution such as the one we have indicated above because, if such a Constitution were to be enacted, most of them would not get past the CitCom level!
Unfortunately, the prospect of having such a Constitution would be feared so much by our politicians that there could be virtually no chance of it being written, or being adopted by a Sri Lankan Parliament.
Depressingly, we are left with the options of fuelling a revolution that would involve unmanageable violence or to determinedly carryon ?chipping away? patiently and unremittingly at the foundations of the monstrous institution that now masquerades as the voice of the people.
Meanwhile, we should stop voting first for a party and then for the candidate. It would be far better to choose the best of the candidates put forward by the parties and then vote for the party of this candidate.
A fair chance should be given to promising candidates who are not lawyers.

We'll take the struggle countrywide: UNP
	
UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe said today the UNP and its allies will take this struggle to secure the people?s sovereignty countrywide.
He told who had gathered at the UNP-organised protest rally against the appointment of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa as the prime minister.
?Several parties want Parliament convened. House was prorogued to get away from the situation. We will not allow this for long. People have lost faith in the State system and they ask what is going to happen. People?s franchise and Parliament have been trampled. This is a question of people?s sovereignty, whether we are going to safeguard it or give it up. Political parties, civil society and religious groups want the people?s sovereignty upheld. This struggle will be taken countrywide and to Parliament while a majority of MPs have urged the Speaker to summon Parliament.
?We introduced the 19th amendment under the mandate we received. We established independent commissions, ensured media freedom and created a situation for the people to live without fear. The essence of it is the sovereignty of Parliament and democracy. People excise their franchise because of Parliament. We will go on with the struggle to safeguard these rights. However President Sirisena threw this mandate out of the window, put Parliament to a side and is trying to take over executive powers. We are against that move and we won?t allow it. We are now committed to ensuring the democratic rights of the people. They expected they will do everything by Monday and we will be quiet. However we have made Temple Trees a symbol of democracy where people will organize themselves to win at the risk to their lives.
?The three main political parties together with other parties and civil society groups fielded a common candidate for the 2015 presidential elections to struggle for democracy. Several ministers in the previous government of Mahinda Rajapaksa and others joined us. Following a proposal by former President Chandrika Kumaratunga and JVP we nominated incumbent President Maithripala Sirisena as the common candidate. We in the UNP approved that proposal at its convention. We were committed to establishing democracy. Some of us went into jail and sacrificed out lives for the sake of democracy. We fought with our tears and sweat. Common candidate Maithripala Sirisena was elected president in January 8, 2015. I became the Prime Minister. We were appointed with the mandate of all the people of Sri Lanka and not by the blessins of an individual. This was a mandate to ensure democracy,? Mr. Wickremesinghe said.
UNP Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa also called the people for a struggle to win their rights. "We can win this struggle and then we can build houses, distribute lands for the poor and implement Enterprise Sri Lanka. One we win we can build houses, distribute land and give freedom to people. I am prepared to die on the road to ensure democracy like my father who did the same,? he said
Minister Sarath Fonseka alleged that there was a move to arrest him said he was not afraid to go into prison again. ?They say they put me to prison. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa put me into prison once. The President is trying to do the same. What is Sirisena for a man who confronted the Rajapaksas,? he asked.
Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said 120 MPs have sent a letter asking the Speaker to summon Parliament. (Yohan Perera)

Will justice  be achieved regarding Eknaligoda  ?
	
?
?
If the President is making such a statement, then internal problems should be solved expediently without trying to protect the army from its wrongdoings
	The 2015 Government was appointed for the reason that they will right the wrongs and injustice done by the past government
?
Prageeth Eknaligoda was a revolutionary journalist, who through his writings and caricatures denounced the previous Government led by President Mahinda Rajapaksa. On January 24, 2010, he left his office, interestingly two days before Presidential polls, saying that he has to meet an old friend and had not been seen since then. With no doubt about it, Prageeth?s wife and family to this date believe that he was abducted, taken to the Girithale Army Camp, tortured and killed under instructions of the Rajapaksa family. Eknaligoda had been investigating the alleged use of chemical weapons against civilians by the Army in the fight against the LTTE.
With the election of President Sirisena, investigations reopened and from time to time different suspects have been taken into custody. However at a press conference held recently, Mrs. Eknaligoda, expressed her disappointment over the lack of support of the present Government to the ongoing investigations by the CID alleging that the Government is not living up to the promise made when they assumed power. She is also not happy with their commitment towards bringing to justice the perpetrators of national crimes. Although she has been fighting for justice regarding her husband for more than 8 years now, the determination in her face showed that she is at no point ready to give up. It was a blend of sorrow, resentment and repugnance that was conveyed through her voice as she related her story to us. She claims to have approached both the President and the Army Commander pleading for their support to conclude Prageeth?s investigations, but said that the Army intelligence is withholding crucial information and data needed to carry out investigations and facilitate the court procedure. She mentioned how the information?
requested are easily retrievable - CCTV footage of entrance and exit from the Girithale army camp; information on telephone calls. According to Mrs. Ekneligoda, although the CID has been requesting for this data from the Army intelligence since 2016, all they received were excuses; at one point the information was unavailable and at another point their disclosure would threaten national security.?
?
Although our soldiers who fought the civil war are indeed heroes, that does not empower them to kill the innocent
??Recently, the President at the 73rd United nations general Assembly talked about the independence of Sri Lanka and asked the UN and member states not to pressure Sri Lanka in dealing with war crimes. If the President is making such a statement, then internal problems should be solved expediently without trying to protect the army from its wrongdoings??
Pidurangala incident
Chameera Perera, Convener of the Left Centre, expressed his views, reminding the Government of the reason it was appointed in the first place. He drew on the incident where the Prime Minister reacted immediately to the Pidurangala incident where 16-year-old boys were misbehaving and ordered that rigorous punishment be imposed on them to show how fast the executive is capable of responding to a situation. However, although 3 ? years have passed since Prageeth?s abduction, the activist stated that there has been little to no support from the executive to speedup investigations. ?The 2015 Government was appointed for the reason that they will right the wrongs and injustice done by the past government. That was the sole reason that they came into power. Yet, what the Government does is hide behind the need to uphold the reputation of the army. The best way the Government can show honour to the army is by fulfilling its responsibility.?
Racism?
Sudesh Nandimal Silva, a key eyewitness of the 2012 Welikada riots and activist of prisoners? rights spoke of how the disappearance of Prageeth are connected to other national issues embedded in society, like racism. As he claims, Prageeth Ekneligoda, being an anti-racist and true portrayer of the pressure and terror under which citizens in the North lived during the war is what gave the then government motive to abduct and kill him. ?If you are against racism, people will call you ?Sinhala Kotiya?. The present government only pumps oxygen to racism in this country?.??
As indicated by him, another national issue that the Government allegedly refuses to confront is the violation of rules of war by the state forces. He pointed out that although our soldiers who fought the civil war are indeed heroes, that does not empower them to kill the innocent. ?Defending army officers who abuse their power is the best possible way the Government can disrespect the army. Protecting the Rajapaksas and diverting people?s attention to petty things is not the way out.?
Threats to journos?
Joseph Stalin from the Ceylon Teachers? Union recalled Minister Sagala Rathnayake?s statement that 126 journalists in Sri Lanka have reportedly received threats up to now and expressed his disappointment that only 5 investigations that are happening. ?The fact that only 5 investigations are going on means that 121 other journalists are at risk. It is time that the Government stops hiding files and obstructing investigations on Prageeth, because we know they are only trying to escape the law.?
The disappearance of Eknaligoda is not a single problem that affects his family and cannot be taken in isolation as affecting a few people only. It impinges upon many other social and political realities that underlie how our country and Government functions. It is vital that everyone be subjected to the ordinary law of the country and perpetrators of national crimes be actively sought if there is to be any people are to vest any confidence in the justice system. Despite what result an investigation might bring, everyone is entitled to a fair procedure, and after all, isn?t that what good governance is all about??

Although the Daily Mirror sought to obtain a response from the Army regarding this matter, all our attempts failed.?

## Title: Yashoda Wimaladharma For the love of acting

Yashoda Wimaladharma For the love of acting
	
?
A scene from ?Vaishanavee? by Sumithra Peries
?
?
Over the decades since then, she has, for some reason, learnt to tone down, and radically so
	Yashoda Wimaladharma represents something of a conundrum. Like most of her contemporaries, she came from the stage
?
I met her for the first time three years ago, in Mount Lavinia. I met her many times before that too, but through the films and serials she was in,? ?Graced? would be a better way of putting it. In any case, she put me off when I called her. She told me flatly that unless the two of us met, she would not consent to an interview.? ?
It was hard not to be entranced by her. Harder not to be rebuffed by her. For the truth of the matter is, I can?t think of an actress more capable of ice cold reserve, of the sort of indifference that makes you want more, than her. Most of our actresses graduated from ice maidens to sweethearts. For her, it has been the other way around. That is what constitutes her, as an actress and, to a considerable extent, a human being.? ?
Yashoda Wimaladharma represents something of a conundrum. Like most of her contemporaries, she came from the stage. Unlike most of them, she never abandoned the stage. She has, moreover, gone on record saying that it is not easy to induce her into a performance unless she?s read through a script. That level of discipline, while not unparalleled or unsurpassed, is admirable and rare.? ?
She is not ageless, but she embodies agelessness. In Samanala Sandhwaniya she makes the trek from a young lover to an old beauty. Then as now, makeup remains the most unconvincing aspect of the Sinhala film. But in this film, there is no falseness in her transformation. It?s as though her performance transcends the makeup department.? ?
The Sinhala cinema graduated from Rukmani Devi, who chased the man of her dreams in film after film, to Malini Fonseka, who was chased by those men and yet spurned them till the very end, to Swarna Mallawarachchi, who spurned and at the same time made us feel she wanted them. Yashoda comes from the generation that immediately followed Swarna?s. It was a difficult time for our cinema, and this was more or less reflected in the role we ascribed to the female performer: seductive, yet strongly independent and fully capable of agency.? ?
Acting didn?t come to her. She had to be ?taken in?. During her A/Levels years, her uncle, Bandula Vithanage, chose her for the lead role in his adaptation of Thornton Wilder?s Our Town, Hiru Dahasa.?
?I won the Best Actress Award at that year?s State Drama Festival,? she remembered, ?which I never expected.?? ?
What happened next? ?I learnt about acting. I read up on technique. I polished myself as much as I could within six months. People were most helpful towards me. But after Hiru Dahasa, I felt the urge to go beyond what I had gained. I wanted to learn more, a problem given that we didn?t have acting schools back then. Nonetheless, my father, who knew my interests well, took me to the only man who could teach me. Jayantha Chandrasiri.? When asked how long she was tutored by him, she admitted, with a faint laugh, ?I still am his student. Although my initial ?training period? went on for a few years, I?m always on the go and ready to take in any new technique. In that sense he taught me the basics of what I needed to know. That widened my interests.?? ?
I can?t really put a finger on why and how Yashoda entrances us so well. Is it her meticulousness? Could be. Her eclecticism (her grasp of different languages, her performances in several non-English language movies)? Perhaps. Her embodiment of tortured innocence in the first few films and serials she was in (from a small part in Doo Daruwo to bigger roles in Duwata Mawaka Misa and Theertha Yathra)? Possibly. Or, by contrast, her embodiment of women capable of ambiguity (think of her roles in Maruthaya and Anantha Rathriya)? Probably.? ?
Yashoda?s essence stems from her versatility. Like most accomplished players, she can salvage a bad film even when it?s at its worst. There are sequences in Vasantha Obeyesekere?s Maruthaya, for instance, where the rest of the cast gives up. Yashoda and the actress playing her sister, Sangeetha Weeraratne, manage to take us through these scenes (such as the seduction of Yashoda?s character by Palitha Perera, or the transformation of the two siblings from a politician?s daughters to prostitutes) though they appear to be, and indeed are, so heavy on our eyes.? ?
The seduction by Palitha Perera and an earlier seduction by Neil Alles seem peripheral to the story; nevertheless, Yashoda, the object of both men?s desires, makes it relevant. Towards the end, the two women, at a night club, are shown to have made the trek from privilege to prostitution; a series of jump cuts ends with the transformation of the statues of two models to the two of them; this, the most symbolic sequence in the film, sacrifices a great deal of emotive power, yet it resonates because of Yashoda?s ability at channelling that power even when she seems wooden and statuesque.? ?
Theertha Yathra and the much better Duwata Mawaka Misa represents two of the last instances where Yashoda openly away her emotions. There is not a single scene in Theertha Yathra (also by Obeyesekere), for instance, where she is not pondering, brooding, or crying. It?s so overwhelming that none of the other characters can take it: not the father (Ravindra Randeniya) or mother (Veena Jayakody), who are not her real parents; not her fianc?e (Channa Perera), who is both disdainful of and drawn towards her; and not her actual father (Joe Abeywickrama), the latter of whom is the only other person more emotionally inclined than her. That emotiveness comes out more subtly in Duwata Mawaka Misak (by Sumitra Peries); her performance there was so well received that she clinched that year?s Presidential Award for the Best Supporting Actress.? ?
Over the decades since then, she has, for some reason, learnt to tone down, and radically so. When she teamed up with Jayantha Chandrasiri (for the first time since he had coached her in the eighties) with Agnidahaya, she entered a different terrain. The difference between her earlier phase and this new one comes out more strongly in Chandrasiri?s next film, Guerrilla Marketing, a difference that can at once be inferred from the way she represses her emotions and the way her rival, played by Sangeetha Weeraratne, gives into hers.? ?
When Yashoda smiles, or laughs, or ponders on her old romance with Sangeetha?s husband (Kamal Addaraaarachchi), she doesn?t yield; when Sangeetha, discovering the affair, tries to confront her, she yields. The difference is one of temperament, a difference that was turned the other way around in Maruthaya, where Sangeetha acted in a more nuanced and matured manner than her sister.? ?
?In Maruthaya and Duwata Mawaka Misak, she raises her voice, but in later movies, she quietens down. This has the effect, interestingly, of sustaining our interest in her whenever she does talk. While I am certainly not qualified to pass judgment on soft but firm drawl, I do admit that there has been no actress capable of conveying both desire and indifference the way she has been able to.? ?
?
In Trojan Kanthawo
?
In the first half of Samanala Sandhwaniya, she is entranced by the young misfit; when she meets him as an adult for the first time, now an older woman, she talks cordially with him, and it almost seems as though the two will get with each other. She makes us expect her to be forgiving with our young hero the moment he performs his song and confesses everything he?s done, to her. But no: after he informs her, she gets up calmly, asks him to never get in touch with her, and leaves.? ?
It is a tragedy, but of the sort that one would never expect: our sympathies, which were with the hero Vageesha all this time, are transferred to her. We do not chide Vageesha for his callousness, yet we feel that the tragedy belonged, not to him, who was there throughout, but to her, who was there intermittently. And she does it, not by her gestures or her emotional power, but by her voice. It is the most potent symbol of her at times contradictory personality; it makes us want to know more about her, and at the same time keeps us from prying into her deepest, innermost secrets.? ?
Yashoda Wimaladharma has been at it for 30 years. Well more than a quarter century. We know more about actresses who?ve spent a fraction of that time than we do about her. This, I believe, is her essential character. Unlike Rukmani, Malini, even Swarna, she makes us want to come after her, and at the same time get away from her. ?Do we truly know you?? I felt tempted to ask her. I didn?t of course, but I can guess the reply: ?Perhaps.? At the end of the day, it doesn?t get more ambiguous than that.
