LG polls should be held using PR system: JVP
	
JVP today said the local government election should be held using the Proportional Representation System used earlier as it would be delayed further if the authorities decided to conduct it under the First Past the Post system that was proposed recently.
Addressing a press briefing, its leader MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake said the Chairman of the Election Commission had informed that at least 56 amendments needed to be made to the current system if they were to use it to conduct the LG polls.
He said that even though the report of the delimitation review committee had been gazetted, measures had still not been taken to resolve the technical issues that existed. He said another gazette notification had to be issued by announcing the number of members to be elected to each local authority, along with the number of slots allotted to woman candidates.
For instance amendments had been recommended to be included in the Local Authorities' Election Act that at least 25 per cent of slots should be reserved for women candidates. Therefore with the number of slots set aside women candidates rising the number has to be gazetted, he said.
Nearly two years has been passed after the tenure of the local government authorities officially ended. Before we hold elections, these matters have to be looked into, all of which takes more time, he said.
Mr. Dissanayake said that it was unclear exactly how many members would make up a local authority with a new election system in place. Under the new system the number of members count rise to 3,423, which is an increase of nearly 60 per cent over the old system. As an example in the Colombo Municipal Council there are presently 53 members. With the new system it would rise to nearly 85. We would have to face the additional problem of space to house these members as well if this takes place, he said.
He said that all the local authority buildings needed to be demolished and more space made for the additional personnel who would be appointed. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Army refutes CBKs allegations
	
The Sri Lanka Army yesterday categorically denieda recent statement, alleged to have been made by former President Chandrika Kumaratunga, the head of an ethnic reconciliation body on sexual exploitation and abuses of Tamil women by the Army in the post war scenario.
"At a time when the Government is genuinely committed to the Rule of Law and Reconciliation, baseless assertions of this nature would only jeopardize the reconciliation process," the army headquarters said in a statement.
Full Statement
The Army Headquarters has noted with dismay a recent statement, alleged to have been made by the head of an ethnic reconciliation body on sexual exploitation and abuses of Tamil women by the Army in the post war scenario. The Army categorically denies the same as a baseless allegation.
In 2010, civil administration was firmly established in the North and the Army withdrew from all forms of civil administration.
Since then, the Army has not been involved in administration concerning civilians, and the question of sexual exploitation and abuses during the said process does not hence arise.
Regrettably, the author of this statement has made unsubstantiated and baseless assertions without specifying any incident of sexual exploitation or abuse.
The Army wishes to place on record that it has a Zero Tolerance Policy on sexual abuses as evidenced in Premawathi Manamperi case in 1971, Krishanthi Kumaraswamy case and Rajini Vellaydunpillai case that took place during the period 1995-2005. In all these instances, the Army fully cooperated with the civil court cases against the accused who were on trial, resulting in death penalty.
In line with this principle, the Army always takes stern action on Army personnel against whom ex facie cases have been and discharged summarily from the Army despite acquittal/pending action in civil courts. It shall continue to pursue this policy.
At a time when the Government is genuinely committed to the Rule of Law and Reconciliation, baseless assertions of this nature would only jeopardize the reconciliation process.

## Title: HC Judge appointment, threatens independence of the Judiciary: MR

HC Judge appointment, threatens independence of the Judiciary: MR
	
The Yahapalana Government authorities had been trying to reward the BAR Association, who played a major role in changing the Government in 2015, posed a threat to the independence of the Judiciary by irregularly appointing High Court Judges, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said today.
Issuing a press release he stated that some office bearers of the Bar Association were trying to abuse their power to appoint judges, despite the damage that would do to the entire legal system.
Commenting on the recent appointed Mr. Ramanathan Kannan as a HC judge, he said the accepted practice in the country was all the judges serving on the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal and High Court were promoted to those positions through the ranks of the Judicial Service or to a lesser extent.
This system of promotion based on seniority and merit is one of the pillars on which the independence of the Judiciary rests. On very rare occasions past Governments have appointed eminent members of the private Bar as Supreme Court Judges Mr. Rajapaksa said.
He said that during the nine years of his tenure as the President, he had appointed only one Supreme Court Judge from the private Bar and no other members of the private Bar were appointed to either the Court of Appeal or the High Court.
Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe had recently informed the Judicial Services Commission that a certain political party had on an earlier occasion requested of him that Mr. Kannan be appointed to the High Court  a request he had turned down.
The appointment of a judge on a recommendation made by a political party would have shook the very foundations of judicial independence, he said.
However, Judicial Services Association has pointed out that if the need was to appoint a Tamil speaking judge for the North and East, the District Judge of Vavuniya D.L.A. Manaf would have been the most qualified candidate. Nobody would have objected if a Tamil speaking candidate of suitable seniority and competence had been selected for this position from within the judicial service.
The request has come only from certain individuals in the BASL. In any case, the Bar Association of Sri Lanka has no Constitutional, legal or moral right to make recommendations for the appointment of judges. If the private bar is given the power to recommend the appointment of judges, that would corrupt the entire legal system with judges being dependent on the lawyers appearing before them for promotions and appointments.
The reason why Mr. Kannan was made a High Court judge over the heads of many dozens of serving judicial officers and Senior State Counsel in the AGs Department is also obviously to reward a certain political party that provided a block vote to get the President elected, the former President said.
Mr. Rajapaksa also stated that the BAR Association is politicized in a way no other professional body in this country is - whether it be that of engineers, doctors, architects, planters, public administrators, or accountants.
Being a lawyer myself, I wish to call upon the legal fraternity to take resolute action to end the politicisation of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka and most importantly, to get the President to reverse the decision to appoint Mr. Kannan to the High Court. It is essential to abide by the accepted practice in making judicial appointments so as to safeguard the independence of the judiciary, he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Heavy showers in coming days  Met. Dept.
	
Heavy showers were expected in many region of the country in the coming days, the Department of Metrology forecasted today.
Fairly heavy showers (75mm-100mm) in several places, especially in the Sabaragamuwa, Southern, Uva, Central and Western provinces and in the Ampara and Batticaloa Districts, it said.
Temporary localized strong winds during thundershowers were also predicted. The general public is requested to take adequate precautions to minimise damages caused by lightning, the Met Department said.
Meanwhile, the Disaster Management Center warned of rough seas off the coasts from Batticaloa to Pottuvil.
"Due to the active cloudiness in the deep and shallow sea areas of the coast extending from Batticaloa to Balapitiya via Pottuvil, Hambantota and Matara sudden roughness of the sea areas associated with sudden increase of wind speed (up to 70-80kmph) is possible, it said.
Naval and fishing communities are requested to be vigilant," the Disaster Management Center warned. (Yohan Perera)
