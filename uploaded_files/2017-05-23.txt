Can?t pin it all on Ravi K: GL
	
The Government could not possibly pin the entire responsibility of its economic failures and fiscal shortcomings on former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake as he was not the source of the problem, the Joint Opposition said today.
It said if the Government was attempting to shy away from taking responsibility of all these failures by sacrificing Mr. Karunanayake, it would be a fiasco.
?There is no denying that there were many criticisms over the way Mr. Karunanayake handled the Ministry and took decisions. However, trying to place the entire responsibility of failures on him is of no use,? JO?s spokesman G.L. Peiris told a news conference.
He said Mr. Karunanayake was given the Ministry by clipping its wings as the Treasury was under the purview of Prime Minister and the authority to make decisions with regard to commercial banks was given to Minister Kabir Hashim.
?At the time he was the Finance Minister, Ravi Karunanayake had no authority over the Central Bank or over the commercial banks. This was like appointing an Education Minister with no authority over schools,? he said.
He said the Cabinet Committee on Fiscal Management headed by Prime Minister was the force of fiscal decision making of the country. He said only close Ministers and officials took part in these Committee Meetings. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Green living in an eco-friendly world
	
Source - Dr M.A.B. Prashantha, Senior lecturer, Department of Chemistry, Sri Jayewardenepura University?
At a time when the world is engaged in an expedition of creating a greener tomorrow by means of eco-friendly products and renewable energy, the people themselves seem to have felt the pulse of man-made anthropogenic disasters. Today, the nature has started to reciprocate in such a manner that people have paused to sit and think of a way to recover an environment that has gravely suffered destructive human activities. After all, many of the natural catastrophes are direct results of human actions, either intentional or impulsive. The people of today have finally fathomed the realities of life, that to lead a good life, he or she should co-exist with the environment and preserve the limited resources for the future generations.?
Events that lead to modern green living are perhaps the outcome of human activities practiced centuries ago. Plastic and polythene were invented for the convenience of people and not to endanger their lives.?
But headlined in newspapers and other form of media are the cons of using plastic and polythene; polluting water bodies, soil and air by contributing to global warming. In the natural process, these burned polythene and plastics are absorbed by clouds and sent back to earth and absorbed by the soil.?
They are then passed on to trees from which people consume the bearings. The chain of destruction we cause to nature therefore is an endless cycle.?
Environmental pollution?
According to Dr. Prashantha, the green concept is heavily dependent on human efforts. ?If humans can use fewer raw materials for production, a lot of resources could be saved. We will be able to reduce environment pollution by limiting the consumption of power and water,? he said.?
Water footprint?
According to the water footprint, it is calculated that at least10 litres of water are used to produce one slice of bread, 2,400 litres to make a quality t-shirt and a significant 2,500 litres to make a hamburger. People are unaware of the volumes of water used for these productions. To make matters worse, water usage has increased over the years in the wake of new productions. ?Going green? does not solely mean using organic productions, but also minimising waste.?
Spending money lavishly for unnecessary goods is a total waste. People should remember that by making unnecessary purchases, they contribute to preserve the environment. If people waste their money because they own it, they are unbalancing a system that is invisible to the closed mind.?
Production should be limited to manufacturing the essentials. Overproduction outweighs sustainability. This is an unending vicious cycle. People are allured to impulsive buying and consuming things. By engaging in this cycle, vital resources such as power, water and raw materials are wasted and the environment polluted. If some product corrupts the mind of a consumer, that is an unrecorded pollution. The consumption of alcohol is yet another example of mental pollution. Experts have forecast that 90% of the world?s drinking water will be exhausted by 2025 and the rapid population growth population is one of the key reasons.?
Mindfulness?
Overindulgence of food is making people sick, especially with non-communicable diseases such as obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure. On the other hand, medicine production needs power and materials. The biggest issue in creating an unnecessary temptation to buy things is a result of diversification of customer goods. Merchants will try to sell anything in this consumerism capitalised societies, but it is us, the consumers who have to be aware of the temptations. If a person buys, for instance, five t-shirts, someone else misses his or her chance to get hold of them, thus creating the need for more production.?
Japan practices the 5S concept with a long-term vision and it is taught to children at an early age. When they become adults, they are going to be the expected ?ideal citizen.? In Sri Lanka, we too have to teach our future generations of sustainable living practices.?
Limited resources
Non-renewable energy is limited and the human race is already facing the challenge of finding other alternatives for generating power. Many bio-fuels have been invented and are in use. Water will become a limited resource by 2030. The world already lacks enough resources for the fast growing population.?
In Sri Lanka, we have a unique food culture, prosperous agriculture and completely sustainable lifestyle. All what we had in the past are being forgotten by our own people. They knew much better on how to use resources sustainably.?
Plastic production?
Excess polythene and plastics are circulating in the market. If observed carefully, these products are slowly replacing household utensils that were originally made from wood, steel, glass and other harmless material. Markets are overflowing with unnecessary plastic products with a very low price and inferior quality.?
The people however resort to buy those affordable products to store food. The exact material in cheap plastics is unknown most of the time, but is definite that those are unhygienic. Some household utensils made of plastics that react to heat.?
When food is stored in them, they undergo several chemical changes thereby increasing the risk of forming carcinogens. We use many plastics only once and throw them in garbage. From that moment on, the environment has to deal with the ill effects of plastics.?
Production of papers?
A4 papers are not just papers but the result of a very long production process that consumes gallons of water. It takes upto 40 litres of water to make a single page. The world is aware of the wastage done by paper production, and most of the responsible institutions are cross-cutting the paper usage.?
Consumerism?
Overproduction is related with consumerism. NCD (Non - Communicable Diseases) is yet another threat we Sri Lankans face. In the journey of passing a low-income country limit to a high-income country, the higher levels of society have respiratory related NCD risks.?
Modern man will walk to 2050 with many problems.?
The breaking down of petroleum era will give birth to a lot of other socioeconomic issues. Who can say that using garbage as a fuel has not contributed to global warming? The Middle East and African regions are to suffer severe water shortages in future and that could lead to many political, economical and social issues. Petroleum decaying will lead to a recession of petrochemical production, which is used as the main material in plastic production. And the plastic era will have to de-crown itself.?
Materialism and capitalism?
Modern capitalism is a mixture of materialism and idealism. Materialism is based on the development of science and technology. Idealism is based on the mind and in accordance with religion, gods and the soul.?
The capitalist politics use religion as a tool to control people.?
People in the past 100 - 150 years have used natural resources limitlessly, without thinking about the results. They were unable to manage natural resources and that has led to complications the modern world is facing. The results have become critical for the present and the future societies.?
Sustainable living can be started with the family. Curtailing unnecessary expenses, avoiding impulsive purchasing, growing fruits and vegetables at home and minimising polythene and plastic usage are a few ways to practice this.?

Buddhika Kumara from the Hatton National Bank (HNB) Athurugiriya customer centre was the lucky winner to drive a brand-new Nissan Leaf home at the conclusion of a grand draw under HNB PLC?s New World Rewards 2017 - Sri Lanka?s first online banking rewards system.?
The momentous occasion marked the first time a local bank in Sri Lanka rewarded its customers with grand rewards on the scale offered to HNB?s electronic banking customers. The New World Rewards Campaign by HNB was launched at the start of July and concluded in January 2017. The project was initiated to promote HNB?s innovative electronic banking platform and its wide array of other services available to their valuable customers.?
Through the promotion, the bank offered customers reward points for every digital transaction conducted, with customers who were able to accumulate a large number of reward points being selected for a chance to win a Nissan Leaf - the grand prize of the promotion while each monthly draw concluded in the gifting of a brand-new iPhone 6S to one lucky customer. Each time the customers used the HNB e-banking portal, they increased their chances of entering the final and the monthly draws. ?
Kumara, who is currently employed at Almarai Corporation in Saudi Arabia, is a frequent user of HNB?s Internet banking. Using his e-banking account, he sends money to his wife and his parents in Sri Lanka and settles all mobile and utility bills on time. Though he is thousands of miles away from Sri Lanka, Kumara is confident in the knowledge that his hard-earned money will always arrive safely into the hands of his loved ones, thanks to HNB?s comprehensive online banking services.
?When the bank called me and said that I have won a Nissan Leaf, it was a really pleasant surprise for me. I have been using HNB?s electronic banking facility for almost a year now but didn?t even know that the bank was running such a promotion,? Kumara said.?
?I told my wife first that she has become an owner of a brand-new car and she couldn?t believe it. I shared the news with my parents afterwards and everyone joined the celebrations.?
Kumara is a long-standing customer of HNB. For the past seven years, HNB has been a true partner in Kumara?s progress.?
?My wife and I got married last year. While I was working in Saudi Arabia, she took care of all wedding-related work and managed them. Thanks to HNB?s e-banking, my wife could settle all payments on time as the transferring of money was so quick and convenient. It is very easy to use and all transactions are safe within the platform. I never had to call the bank?s call centre and confirm whether a transaction was successful. HNB?s Internet banking gives me the feeling of being home and completing my transactions with ease,? said Buddhika. As the leading private sector bank in Sri Lanka, HNB aims to position its state-of-the-art online banking platform as the pinnacle of integrated, digitally-driven banking service. The portal empowers users with complete flexibility and convenience to fully automate their transactions and other payments with real-time updates. ?HNB Head of Electronic Delivery Channels Mangala Wickramasinghe said, ?The digital disruption taking place is redefining the banking and financial industry with novel methods of digital banking.

ISIS claims responsibility for Manchester attack
	
ISIS has claimed responsibility for the Manchester Arena attack, hailing the bomber as a "soldier of the caliphate", the Independent reported a short while ago.
The terrorist group released statements in several languages through its central media body praising the atrocity, claiming more than 100 "crusaders" were killed or wounded at the "shameless" concert.
"With Allah's grace and support, a soldier of the Khilafah [caliphate] managed to place explosive devices in the midst of the gatherings of the crusaders in the British city of Manchester," said the English version.
It suggested the atrocity was not a suicide attack, despite police statements saying the perpetrator died at the scene, and did not name him as a "martyr".
Isis said the attack aimed to terrorise "infidels...in response to their transgressions against the lands of the Muslims".
The group's supporters had been circulating an unverified video claiming to show a masked English-speaking militant claiming responsibility for the Manchester attack.
But analysts pointed out that a flag positioned behind the man was not the symbol most commonly associated with Isis, which he did not refer to by its usual name. It was unclear when it was filmed.
The blast killed 22 people and injured dozens more at an Ariana Grande concert on Monday night.
Ian Hopkins, the Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police, said investigators believe the attack was carried out by a lone suicide bomber ?carrying? a homemade device.

Israel signs $630-Mn defence deal with India

JERUSALEM AFP May21, 2017 - Israel announced Sunday it had reached a deal worth $630 million to provide India?s navy with missile defence systems, following a record weapons sale between the two countries last month. ??
The new contract will see state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries supply LRSAM air and missile defence systems for four Indian naval ships, a statement from the company said. ??
IAI said the contract will be carried out with India?s Bharat Electronics Limited, which will be the project?s main contractor. ??
LRSAM is an advanced air and missile defence system, jointly developed by IAI and India?s Defence Research and Development Organisation. ??
In April, IAI said India will buy nearly $2 billion worth of weapons technology from Israel in what was described as the ?largest defence contract? ever signed by the military exporting giant. ??

Lankan refugee given ?inadequate care? before death
	
A Sri Lankan asylum seeker who died from a severe asthma attack just hours after arriving at the Christmas Island immigration detention centre had received inadequate medical care, a West Australian coroner has found.
Arulselvam Velmurugu fled communal riots in Sri Lanka in November 2012 and arrived in Australia almost six months later after two boat journeys and nearly three months in a refugee camp in Sumatra, where deadly fights broke out, The West Australian reported on Tuesday.
The 35-year-old was treated for his asthma at a hospital in Medan, where his care was better than on Christmas Island, Coroner Barry King said in findings released on Tuesday.
While Mr. Velmurugu died from natural causes, the government-appointed health care contractor International Health and Medical Services Pty Ltd did not have an appropriate triage system and lacked an effective equipment organisation and maintenance system, the news report said.
There had also been a possible communication error, Mr King said. The coroner said he was unable to find whether the failure to provide Mr. Velmurugu with an adequate standard of treatment and care contributed to his death.

Twenty two people have been killed and about 59 injured in a suspected terror attack at Manchester Arena.
Police were called to reports of an explosion at the venue at about 22:35 BST following a pop concert by the US singer Ariana Grande.
The cause of the blast is unknown but North West Counter Terrorism unit is treating it as a possible terrorist incident, sources have told the BBC.
Greater Manchester Police is working to set up a contact number for relatives.
Officers have told the BBC there is a second suspect device near where the first explosion occurred.
Reporters were moved away from the scene and a controlled explosion has taken place.
BBC Home Affairs Correspondent Daniel Sandford said senior counter-terrorism officers were assembling in London and liaising with the Home Office.
British Transport Police say the explosion was in the foyer area of Manchester Arena.
Manchester Victoria station, which is close to the concert venue, has been closed and all trains cancelled. (BBC)

Many Lankan refugees plump for repatriation
	
A special camp of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) held in?Trichy to guide Sri Lankan refugees on repatriation to their home received a good response from the refugees with many of them expressing their desire to go back.
Earlier, the refugees were sceptical on repatriation due to uncertainty over their future, but the UNHCR came forward to allay their fears and provided them all the guidance required to clear the formalities for their repatriation.
As a part of the programme, two officials from UNHCR in Chennai conducted the two-day camp at the district collectorate on Monday. On the first day, some of the refugees expressed their willingness to be repartiated.
"A total of 16 members from nine families attended the camp. They are interested in returning to their home towns in Sri Lanka. Most of them who came today are natives of Jaffna and Vavuniya," regional special deputy collector, S Natarasan told TOI.
The officials verified the documents to authenticate their Sri Lankan origin and their passports. UNHCR would even help them apply for passports in the Sri Lankan embassy in Chennai if they had not obtained the same.
UNHCR would also take care of the travel expenses to Sri Lanka and provide financial assistance for their survival until they are accustomed to the situation to earn on their own. "We will provide financial assistance to maintain their daily needs for at least three months in Sri Lanka," said Natarasan.(Times of India)

Medical Negligence at Rajiv Gandhi Govt. Hospital in Chennai, Causes Death of a Sri Lankan
Rizviya, the deceased mother
?
Medical negligence is not unheard of and patients have died under such circumstances all around the globe. In this day and age one would think that doctors have no bias against a patient?s nationality. However, a ?Sri Lankan family learned the hard way that there were doctors who showed no concern for a suffering patient. ?On April 26, a Sri Lankan family of four left for India on vacation. Sitty Rizviya Zubair (51) with her sons Arshad Abdul Kalam M. Feroze (34), Amzal Abdul Kalam (29) and daughter-in-law Mrs. Amzal (21), had planned to go abroad to do some shopping before the Ramadan festive season and before Rizviya moved into her new house. However, three days before they were scheduled to leave for Sri Lanka, they met with an untimely accident and were rushed to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, where they were not given any form of emergency treatment and which resulted in Rizviya?s death. ?
?
?
The Accident ?
On Sunday, April 30, after shopping at the Pothys, Arshad ordered an Uber to take them back to their hotel, the Eastern Palace Hotel in Mannady. As the driver was unfamiliar with the route, Arshad sat in front to direct him, a route he had become familiar with after many years of visiting Chennai. In the back seat sat his mother, his sister-in-law and his younger brother. While travelling along a bridge at Chennai Kamarajar Salai, Arshad felt the car speed up all of a sudden. Instinctively holding on to the dashboard and the hood of the car, he started screaming at the driver to hit the breaks. ?We were on a bridge and there was a bend going to the left. We were going at a normal speed and then suddenly the car started speeding. Then, instead of taking the bend the car just went straight and hit the barricades.? Arshad told the Daily Mirror. ?
Mrs. Amzal who had been having a quiet conversation with her mother-in-law too felt the car suddenly speed up. ?I felt the car hitting the pavement and I could hear my brother-in-law screaming at the driver to hit the breaks. Then I hit my head on something and fell unconscious. Since I was seated in the middle, I had nothing to hold on to.? She did not remember what happened after that until she awoke at the hospital. ?
Rajiv Gandhi General Hospital
?
Amzal who had been sleeping during the ride, woke up to his brother?s screams and the impact of the car hitting the pavement. He said that he too could not remember anything that happened between the time of the accident and waking up in hospital. ?
According to Arshad, the car had accelerated so much that it had gone over the pavement, hit the barricades which consisted of iron bars, broken the boundary wall and flown off the bridge. ?I felt like a piece of paper flying in the wind,? he said. Below them was a two-way road with a small pavement in the middle. The car flew over one road and toppled on to the second road landing upright. Upon landing, Arshad, the only passenger who was conscious throughout the incident despite being injured, saw the driver lying unconscious on his lap and quickly exited the vehicle. Ignoring his bleeding left arm, he looked towards the passenger seat where he saw Amzal, Mrs. Amzal and his mother unconscious and mumbling in pain. Screaming their names he put his hand through Amzal?s window which was smashed and patted his cheeks trying to wake him. Failing to do so, he opened the door and carried Amzal towards the divide of the two roads. By then, pedestrians and motorists had come running to their aid. Together they slowly pulled out Mrs. Amzal who was screaming that her shoulder and arm were in pain. Placing her next to her husband they tried to open Rizviya?s door which was jammed, resulting in her being slowly pulled across the seat out of the vehicle. ??
?
?Mama was conscious and when she tried to move she started screaming that her back was hurting.? Arshad said. ?
?I then took my brother?s wallet, cell phone and everything else that had fallen in the car. Mama was screaming that she couldn?t stay there, so I was trying to calm her down until the ambulance arrived. The tarred road was very hot, so she couldn?t even stretch her legs. Someone splashed water on her and my sister in law?s face because they were about to faint. While I was speaking to the police, my brother suddenly stood up and was looking around. When I shouted his name he didn?t hear me, he looked like he was in shock. Finally when I got his attention, I told him to take our shopping bags out of the boot of the car. To this day he does not remember doing this.? ??
When the ambulance arrived, Rizviya was taken in a stretcher while a few passers-by had to carry Mrs. Amzal into the ambulance. According to Arshad, before the ambulance doors were closed, the driver held onto the door and asked them to forgive him. ?
Whilst in the ambulance, Arshad made two quick calls to Sri Lanka, one to Mrs. Amzal?s father who had family friends living in Chennai and the second to his wife, informing them of the accident. ??
?Mama was in severe pain in the ambulance. She had been given oxygen and was coughing up blood. She was screaming ?that her back was hurting while ?Mrs. Amzal was in pain because her shoulder was hurting. Amzal was saying he couldn?t breathe during the ride to the hospital. We soon arrived at the Rajiv Gandhi Hospital.? said Arshad. ??
The police informed Arshad that on a weekday, that particular road they had landed on was usually very busy and had it not been a Sunday, they would have suffered worse injuries. ?
?
Arrival at the Rajiv Gandhi Hospital ?
?Our people also suffered there no? So let them be a bit, that?s ok? ?
Once they arrived at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, Arshad filled in the admission forms and his family was transferred inside one by one. They were admitted to the hospital at 4.30pm. Before they were transferred inside, he was told by a nurse to remove any valuables on his mother, brother and sister-in-law, which he did. As he was expecting the arrival of the Indian family friends (who wished anonymity) who were only ten minutes away, he waited in the reception area to hand over whatever valuables he had at hand as he preferred to keep them with friends rather that in a locker offered to him by the hospital. During this time, Arshad spotted two female hospital staff members entering the room and asking the nurse about the patients that had just been admitted. ?
?Upon hearing that they were Sri Lankans, the staff members had laughed and said, ?Our people also suffered there no? So let them be a bit, that?s ok?. ?At that time there were no other patients in the area, so I could hear them very clearly.? ??
As his wife had called and informed the hotel about the accident, a few hotel staff members had been sent to the hospital to see how their guests were doing. After the arrival of the hotel staff, came Sithy*, her daughter Fathima* and son-in-law, Mrs. Amzal?s family friends. Once everyone had arrived, Arshad was taken into a ward in a wheelchair where he saw his mother lying on a bed. To her left was the driver and to her right lay Amzal, while Mrs. Amzal lay on a bed opposite her. ??

?
Treatment and the Doctors? Attitude ?
The family was not taken to an ICU or an Emergancy Treatment Unit, instead they were taken to a casualty ward where there were other patients in a normal condition. As there was a doctors? strike that day, there were only three or four doctors in the ward. ?
?When I went in, I slowly walked towards my mama to check on her condition. She was screaming, saying her back, neck and chest were hurting. She had the oxygen mask on and it was covered with blood because she was coughing up blood. When she turned to the side and tried to breathe, she would cough up more blood. When we told the doctor she was coughing blood, he told us to lift the oxygen mask for her to spit it out. I told mama to slowly spit out the blood and not to panic, otherwise her blood pressure would go up. At the same time, my brother was screaming that he couldn?t breathe and I had to try to calm him as well,?said Arshad. ?
He further said, ?The ward doctors would keep coming in to check on my mother and brother before leaving. They didn?t give them any emergency treatment. I tried to tell Amzal not to stiffen his body but to loosen up and that he might be able to breathe more easily. My mother could hear him shouting and asked me to go and ask someone to give him oxygen and to get my wounds treated because my left arm was bleeding. She also told me to go and sit somewhere and rest because I was injured as well.? ?
?
?
?When we spoke to a female doctor sitting at a desk, she said we were not the only patients there and that they had to take care of the others too. But the other patients looked to be normal and they weren?t screaming in pain like we were,? he added. ?
Sithy had gone up to a lady doctor twice and asked her to help Rizviya and both times the doctor said she would come but she never went to Rizviya?s side. ?I went to the doctor a number of times to tell her to see the emergency patients but they treated us indifferently,? she said. ?
?Then suddenly, Mama was screaming that her neck hurt and I had to massage her neck. She was also feeling hot and because there was nothing to fan her with, I had to blow air through my mouth. Then Fathima found a piece of cardboard and we fanned her with that,? Arshad said. ?
As Rizviya?s condition worsened, doctors continued to treat the patients indifferently. ?Mama was turning this way and that, saying she couldn?t breathe and her chest was paining. I asked the doctors if they could at least fix a tube so that she would be able to breathe but they didn?t do anything.? ??
The patients had only been given a drip and no emergency treatment had been performed on the family. ??
?When we asked them to do something, the doctors said they couldn?t do anything until there was a scan or an X Ray. So we told them to do the scans. Then they were asking us to pay for them,? said Sithy. The Indian family friends and hotel staff collected what money they had and received the remaining amount from Arshad and paid for the X rays and scans to be done. ?Even after paying them and showing the receipts, they didn?t do the scans or immediately take us to be X rayed,? Mrs. Amzal said. ?
Half an hour before her passing, Rizviya?s pulse started dropping. Desperately, Arshad ran to the nearest doctors and cried for help saying that his mother was going to die. It was only then the doctors rushed to her side. ?They were doing CPR on her chest. She started to pray and her legs were feeling cold. Then a male doctor came and took me away. They told me to go and sit on a bed. Then a few doctors gathered around her and nurses had also appeared. They brought the manual oxygen, which they were pumping with their hands. Only then did they attempt to fix a tube. When they did this, the blood flowed through the tube. When they were putting in the tube they brought a machine which showed the pulse. The plug wasn?t working and they had to find somewhere else to plug it. Then a lady doctor jumped on to my mother and started giving her CPR. When they tried to give her shock treatment, they didn?t have the gel and I could hear the nurse shouting for someone to bring the gel. Once they got the gel, they couldn?t carry out the treatment because it was too crowded due to the beds and people. They had to push the bed towards the corner of the hall where there were two blinds but I could still see the machines from where I was sitting. The Indian family friends followed them to that corner. Only at the last minute did they start running around and trying to do something,? he said. ?
According to Sithy, in her last minutes Rizviya said, ?I can feel my soul leaving me.? She was saying her prayers and closed her eyes. At that moment Fathima?s phone began playing the Maghrib Azaan (call to prayer). A small smile appeared on Rizviya?s face and she passed away. Even though she had passed away, the doctors and nurses kept trying to give her treatment. ?Up to the time that her pulse dropped, they didn?t do anything for my mother. She was only given the drip and oxygen. None of us was treated. My mother passed away at around 6.30pm. From 4.30 they didn?t try and give her any form of treatment,? Arshad said. ?
Sithy too backed up the fact that proper treatment was not given to Rizviya or to the others. ?I never thought she would pass away there. I went up to the doctors a number of times to tell them to do something. Only in the end, when her soul was leaving her body were they trying to save her. They were climbing on top of her and giving CPR and getting all sorts of machines and tubes. I had gone up to them so many times and told them to have a look at her and they never showed any concern. They had given her oxygen and a drip but there were other treatments that should have been done. They never checked to see what was wrong with her.? ?
?
?
While Rizviya was taken to the other side of the hall, Sithy?s son-in-law, the hotel staff and the others who had come managed to take Amzal for an X Ray. He too was only given a drip and no treatment was done. After the scan, he was brought back to his bed. ?Amzal was in a lot of pain and he was shouting that he couldn?t breathe but they never gave him oxygen,? said Sithy. ?
According to Amzal, he was not examined nor did the doctors ask him any questions about his pain. He could hear his brother talking to the doctors and his mother and wife screaming but he was unable to do anything. ?A doctor came up to me and I told him I couldn?t breathe and needed oxygen but all he said was that I didn?t need oxygen and that I was OK. But I wasn?t, I was suffering.? ?
When Mrs. Amzal was finally taken for a scan it was Sithy, Fathima and another who had to take her for the scan. ?
When they took Mrs. Amzal for the MRI scan, they had to wait outside the scanning room for half an hour in a corridor. Then Fathima noticed something off about Mrs. Amzal?s facial expression and quickly went to notify someone. After speaking to a nurse they learned that Mrs. Amzal?s pulse was dropping. The nurse went to inform the doctor of this and was told to give a small injection, which was done at that time. ?After the injection the doctor said she?ll be alright, but the fact that there was no doctor around at that time was very irresponsible, because we did not even know what was happening to her.? said Sithy. After the MRI scan she and her daughter had to wheel Mrs. Amzal to the ECG scan and for the X Rays. There had been no hospital staff to help them take the patient to get the necessary scans. ??
?
?
Mrs. Amzal had been slipping in and out of consciousness but still remembers hearing her husband and mother-in-law screaming in pain. She said the only time she felt a little bit better was when her father had arrived at the hospital and rushed to her side. ??Our family had informed everyone they knew of the accident and had asked anyone who was in India to come and check on us. So many people came to help us even though the hospital staff was not helpful. Our family had told anyone and everyone who was in India to come and check on us,? said Arshad. ?Arshad realized how differently they were treated while observing the way the driver?s injuries were tended to. ?They were treating him with more care. There were so many medicines on the table next to his bed and they were checking his pressure and his condition was much better than my mother?s. His condition was actually quite similar to mine but they didn?t give me any treatment.? ??
Speaking of the inconsiderate nature of the doctors, Sithy said, ?When we were looking for something to fan Rizviya with, they couldn?t even spare a file or a piece of paper. They were just scribbling things down on pieces of paper. How many times did I go up to the lady doctor but she just scolded me saying they had other patients as well. They just didn?t care and were very rude.? ?
?I could have taken them to another hospital,? said Sithy. ?But at the time there was no one else for me to properly discuss it with. No one in the hospital came up to me and said, ?they are in a serious condition, if you want, you can take them to another hospital?. There was no one to advise or help us at that time.? ??They kept trying to chase us out of the ward. But since we didn?t know what would happen to the three remaining patients. we refused to leave. I was scared that I would return to their dead bodies,? she added. ?
She further said that she had never seen anything like this before and it felt like she was watching a film. ?Watching something like this and not being able to do much was very difficult. The way they were treating them angered me so much but I had to control my anger because if I expressed it, I didn?t know if they would have acted worse.? ?
?
Arrival of Former Mla Hasan Ali And the Entrance of a Senior Doctor. ?
Through family connections, Former Member of Legislative Assembly (M.L.A), Mr. Hasan Ali heard of the accident and rushed to the hospital along with his wife. The sight of the ward and the condition of the three Sri Lankans made him very distressed. He immediately started making arrangements for the family to be transferred to the Sooriya Private Hospital. Mr. Ali saw to it that Mrs. Amzal?s condition was checked to ensure that she was fit enough to be transferred. Then he called the Sooriya Hospital Managing Director(MD) and told him that they needed three beds in the ICU. Although the doctors were off duty, the hospital had organized for all their specialist doctors to arrive and prepare themselves for the incoming patients. ??It was thanks to him that we are alive. If he wasn?t there, I don?t know what would have happened to us,? said Arshad. Sithy too had expressed her gratitude for Mr. Ali?s arrival as she was able to see a major improvement in the situation because of him. ?
?
?
While Mr. Ali was trying to organize their transfer, Arshad lay on a bed to rest. At this point a senior doctor in his fifties entered the ward. The other doctors in the ward were quite young compared to him. ?Some other doctors were crowding behind him which was when I realized that he was important. They were doing their rounds I think. He came up to my bed and asked the other doctors if I was also a patient from the accident case. They told him I was. When he asked about my condition the female doctor sitting at the desk told the senior doctor that I was fine and was taken care of. She was looking at me while saying this. When they were about to go, I called the senior doctor and told him, ?Excuse me doctor but I wasn?t treated at all. I wasn?t even touched. They haven?t done any X Rays or scans for me and my entire body is paining.? He was quite shocked when I said this to him. He asked me what time we were admitted and I told him at 4.30. Then he turned to the doctors and asked them what they were doing without treating us for so long. He then held my left hand, on it there was a masking tape that said MASS No.4 which had meant that I was emergency patient number 4. Then in a loud voice he asked the doctors why we hadn?t been treated first. The female doctor at the desk said, ? There were a lot of patients and we couldn?t treat them?. The senior doctor then said that they were normal patients and that the emergency patients should have been given first priority. He then checked me and said that I should be taken for a scan. Afterwards, he turned around to the group of doctors. I could hear him questioning them. Then he said ?one patient has already passed away. How are you going to take responsibility for this? How are you going to answer to this?? some doctors were just looking down and the others were not saying anything.? Arshad said. ?
?
?
Sithy, who had been close by when the senior doctor entered the ward, could hear him ask the other doctors why the emergency patients weren?t being treated. However, before she could hear anymore, a doctor came up to her and told her that she should not stay so close when the doctors were having such a conversation and told her to move away. ?
Afterwards, the doctor continued his rounds and checked on Amzal before he was on his way. This was at around nine o?clock. However, even though they were told to perform the scans, they were done slowly and not in an efficient manner. By then, Mr. Ali had planned to move the three patients out of the hospital. He had spoken to the police and the hospital. However, the hospital said all the formalities needed to be taken care of before the patients could be transferred. Mr. Ali and the others in the hospital did not wish to leave the patients as they were afraid they would die. Although the hospital was delaying their departure, Mr. Ali managed to have the patients discharged. An ambulance had been arranged to take the patients to the Sooriya Hospital and at 11.30pm the three injured were rushed to the private hospital. ?
?
Arriving at the Sooriya Private Hospital ?
Upon arriving at the hospital, the hospital MD was there to greet them along with a number of doctors. Arshad, Mrs. Amzal and Amzal were taken straight to the ICU. ?I couldn?t raise my arms because they had gone numb, so the doctors had to cut open my shirt to examine me. One doctor was checking my eyes and another was pressing me everywhere, asking where it hurt and was noting down my answers. They brought the scanning machines and X Rays to us and we weren?t required to move.? ?
The patients noted the huge difference in the way they were treated at the private hospital. The MD stayed at the hospital till around one o?clock in the morning and there were doctors and nurses monitoring them constantly. ??
All three patients agreed that the treatment they received at the private hospital was excellent. ?I felt so bad that we were getting this treatment when my mother didn?t get it. The government hospital didn?t give her proper treatment or ease her pain. I can accept that it was her time to go but my mind would have been more at ease if I knew the doctors had done everything in their power to save her,? said Arshad. ?
Rizviya?s cousin brother, Mrs. Amzal?s father and other relatives organized the funeral proceedings and worked together with the police to bring Rizviya?s body to the private hospital where the funeral was to be conducted. After all the paperwork was done and the requirements were met, she was finally brought to the private hospital on the evening of May 1. The MD of the hospital gave a special place in the mortuary for the Islamic funeral rites to be conducted and a small area in the hospital for the prayers and recitals. ?
Injuries sustained ?
Arshad, Amzar and Mrs. Amzal spent three to four days in the ICU at the private hospital. The doctors advised Arshad to rest for six weeks as his left shoulder was slightly dislocated but which would heal automatically. On the left side of the chest, his ribs, muscles and tissue were damaged due to the impact and his left lung was swollen. ?When I breathe and sneeze, I can feel my lungs knocking against my ribs. I don?t have the strength to get up on my left side, I have to lean on my right side. When i walk for about two or three minutes, it starts to hurt behind my ribs and I start sweating and feeling dizzy,? he said. ?
Mrs. Amzal has suffered from a lower right arm fracture, for which she had to undergo surgery where a plate was inserted. In two years, she can have an operation and have the plate removed. She has also suffered a clavical fracture on her left shoulder, which the doctor said will take six months to heal. ?I can?t turn to my left or right side. The doctors have told me not to move too much, otherwise flesh can grow on my shoulder and I?ll have to have another operation.? She is also suffering from internal injuries that will heal over time. The doctors have advised her to rest for six months. ?
Amzal suffers from internal injuries. He has crack on his ribs and backbone and his lungs are inflamed. He also has a muscle sprain and needs to lie on a pillow on his right side. The doctors have advised him to rest for two months. Both he and his wife find it difficult to sneeze and cough. ?
?
The three victims are now in Sri Lanka recovering from their injuries, but one thing they?ll never recover from is Rizviya?s death
?
?
?Dept.HC ?won?t get involved with the investigations...
-The Sri Lankan Deputy High Commission
?
According to Mrs. Amzal?s father, the Minister (Consular) from the Sri Lankan Deputy High Commission in Chennai H.M.K. Herath, arrived at the private hospital on the May 1. He was informed by the family of the accident and was told of the treatment that the Sri Lankan patients received while at the Rajiv Gandhi Hospital. ??
However, when speaking to the Daily Mirror Mr. Herath denied any knowledge on the government hospital?s treatment of the patients and implied that the commission was not looking into the matter. ?There were no complaints about the treatment by the hospital and we were not told anything. We only knew that it was an ordinary traffic accident and that investigations had been concluded. There was no concern raised about the hospital. Whatever assistance that we could have extended here, it was done for the time being,? he said. ?
When asked whether anyone was taken into custody with regard to the investigation, he said, ?The embassy won?t get involved with the investigations if they are not conducted properly. There was no complaint from the relatives or the family members, we were not told and our assistance was not sought in that case. The family members also told us it was an accident. We voluntarily went and assisted them and ?helped them with the funeral and other related issues. We guided them on how to do the death registration. But our assistance was not requested with regard to the investigation.??
?
No response from Rajiv Gandhi Hospital ?
Although the Daily Mirror made a number of calls to the hospital, we were unable to get a statement from them. In the course of four days, several calls were made to eight different numbers and more than half those calls were left unanswered. When the call was finally answered, we were met with rude and unhelpful responses and were not transferred to any senior member or director of the hospital. At one point, when we mentioned that we were from Sri Lanka, the receiver of the call would disconnect without any response. ?

North Korea fires another missile, defying international condemnation
	
?
North Korea on Sunday launched another missile, its ninth this year, in its latest show of defiance to the international community. ??
Despite repeated condemnations and warnings of additional sanctions, Kim Jong Un?s regime has been pressing ahead at a relentless pace to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), which would be capable of reaching the mainland United States. ??
Analysts say the regime has several key technologies to master before it can deliver a nuclear-tipped missile to a target, but point out that it inches closes to its goal with every test. An analysts said it appeared to be another launch of the missile fired in February - the first after President Donald Trump took office. That was a Pukguksong-2 (or Polaris-2), a land-based version of North Korea?s submarine-launched missile. ?
John Schilling, an aerospace engineer and rocket specialist, estimated that the Pukguksong-2 could be launched on five minutes? notice, compared with 30 to 60 minutes for older missile types. ?All of these factors would make it much harder to find and preemptively destroy the Pukguksong-2,? Schilling wrote in a note for 38 North, a website dedicated to North Korea, after the February launch. ?
The North Korean leader called it a ?perfect weapon system,? according to state media reports showing a happy Kim at the launch site, that was able to carry ?a large-size heavy nuclear warhead.??

## Title: Premaranjith Tilakaratne and the roads that take us to him

Premaranjith Tilakaratne and the roads that take us to him
	
In the early 1960s, when the Civil Service was transformed to the Administrative Service, two important things took place. Firstly, it emancipated a horde of playwrights, lyricists and performers who had been inhibited by a largely colonialist government. Secondly, and just as importantly, those playwrights, lyricists, and performers were empowered to carry on with their artistic careers. Both these points, trivial as they appear to us today, were important especially to our playwrights in that they inadvertently pushed them to improve upon our stylised theatre.?
To be sure, not all of them went beyond that stylised theatre. But the few who did, ended up emulating the English kitchen sink drama. They scandalised and sent audiences running out of the hall in droves, but they became as easy-to-infer as the morality plays they were rejecting. To this hodgepodge, then, came a set of other playwrights and critics, who sought to transcend the ideological boundaries of both theatre forms. Few survived from this crowd. Very few.?
Premaranjith Tilakaratne, whose death on Thursday, May 11 went by largely unnoticed and unreported, belonged to that few. He was one of the biggest parvenus our theatre bred. None of his plays, even the most popular ones, was restaged. He belonged to a twilight world, between the morality plays of the fifties and the political plays of the seventies. It is a testament to his individuality that he rejected both these. He did not leave behind a theory that bred its own disciples, but then he would have hated the idea of disciples fawning on his work.?

"He was one of the biggest parvenus our theatre bred. None of his plays, even the most popular ones, was restaged. He belonged to a twilight world, between the morality plays of the fifties and the political plays of the seventies. It is a testament to his individuality that he rejected both these. He did not leave behind a theory that bred its own disciples, but then he would have hated the idea of disciples fawning on his work"
?
His biography has been sketched out elsewhere, but a brief perusal helps us understand the person beneath the artiste. Premaranjith was born in 1937 in Ratnapura. Having attended two local schools, he was later sent to Sri Palee in Horana and Dharmapala Vidyalaya in Pannipitiya. His father, a teacher, became his figure of destiny: he always remembered him as an incongruous figure, driven by values he adhered to at all costs, at times even by resorting to force. ?He taught me honesty, integrity, and fairness,? he remembered in one of those conversations, ?We fought, we argued, we refused to talk with each other frequently. It was after I entered the theatre that I understood who he really was.??
They never had shared interests: the father doted on Sirisena Wimalaweera?s dramas and nadagam, both of which the son disliked so much that he ended up being captivated by the movies. Because Sri Palee closed only on Wednesdays, he and his friends would bunk classes and hitch a ride to the Regal, to watch the latest John Ford and John Wayne feature. They were all caned for this later on, of course. Ironically though, it was the cinema that would get Premaranjith to think about the theatre. He broke into his field when he and a friend of his from Dharmapala, Wickrema Bogoda, went to see the rehearsals of Sugathapala de Silva?s Boarding Karayo. Sugathapala later became his ideological foe: the first time they met, he had angered the man by questioning his commitment to realism. That encounter persuaded him to carve his own path, and with a cast that included Bogoda, Tony Ranasinghe and G.R. Perera, he wrote and directed Waguru Bima in 1963. This was followed in 1964 by a contemporary retelling of the father-son conflict in Sinhabahu, Wahalak Nethi Geyak.?
Two more plays followed ? Thoththa Baba (1965), an adaptation of Joe Orton?s Entertaining Mr. Sloane that was briefly banned for its homosexual undertones, and Ammai Appai (1966), an adaptation of Strindberg?s The Father ? before he abandoned his fixation with the family, the father, and the son with a musical about a set of wayfarers who had no families, no fathers, and no sons.?
That musical, Kontare, an adaptation of West Side Story, projected and affirmed Premaranjith?s wildest fantasies: everything he stood for in his field came out in gushes and torrents there. With a cast as stellar as the publicity material (including Swineetha Weerasinghe, Sunethra Sarachchandra, Anula Bulathsinhala, Lucien Bulathsinhala, Nawanandana Wijesinghe, and Elson Divithurugama), it opened to rave reviews (Bradman Weerakoon was among those who liked it). For the Puerto Ricans and the White Americans at the heart of the original musical, he substituted the Sinhalese, the Tamil, Colombo and outside-Colombo folk.?
His subsequent work was more literary, including an adaptation of Strindberg?s Julie (1977) and a novel take on a Nurti tragedy, Sri Wickrema, the latter of which was staged during J. R. Jayewardene?s presidency and raised rumours (baseless as they were) that he was currying favour with the authorities.?
?
Because he was so open to the West (more so than either Sarachchandra or Sugathapala), he was doted on by the English press: A. J. Gunawardena, Tissa Devendra, and Wimal Dissanayake never failed to praise his plays. This (for some obscure reason) alienated the vernacular press, which sided with his ideological foes to such an extent that he was, as he told me, belittled and cast aside.?
A deeply committed administrator, Premaranjith was always aware of the realities of life. When I put to him that he could have pursued the theatre more, much more, he fired back gently: ?But who?d look after my family? Who?d worry about the finances, the strains of a middle class household? We were jobholders, not aesthetes. We didn?t muck around in the middle of the night begging with a tin cup. We had a life to lead.? And in a way, that life, tumultuous as it was, saw him as a faithful husband, a devoted father, and a flawed but well meaning and responsible human being.?
In one sense he could be a contradictory personality as well, as when in the very same conversation he lambasted those who viewed the arts as a secular activity and then lambasted our cultural texts. He also had his preferences: his favoured artistes from here, for instance, included Premasiri Khemadasa and Shelton Premaratne (music), W.A. Silva (literature), ?Vasantha Obeyesekere and H. D. Premaratne (cinema). When I asked him why, he replied, ?Because they were all primarily visual.??
What he meant there, which I took some time to realise, was that these artistes went beyond the written word and cultural constraints. Once when he got Sarachchandra to listen to the songs from West Side Story, for instance, Sarachchandra had irritably commented, ?It is nothing but cacophony!? That cacophonic or rather polyphonic quality was what the man aimed at. He realised it most vividly in Kontare. His only attempt at a movie script ended up a failure. Piyasiri Gunaratne, a friend of his from Sri Palee, had ventured to direct a story about a prostitute (it would feature Anula Karunathilake and Cyril Wickramage). As Premaranjith pointed out to me, however, the script he was asked to write was watered down, filtered, and butchered. In the end, that movie, Mokada Une, was critically acclaimed but became a box-office disaster. Neither Piyasiri nor Premaranjith got involved with a movie here thereafter. He led two other lives, as writer and translator. I have not read his translations, revealing as they are of his fondness for naturalism (he translated Zola heavily). He didn?t author an original piece of writing. The sole exception was his autobiography Durgaya, published last June. Sadly though, he never launched it.?
A few months ago, at the behest of some friends and acquaintances, he set about planning a media campaign to get it released. And not for nothing: his book was finding its way to a vast number of readers. An official ceremony would have got his story out there even more. That ceremony, as he planned it, was to be graced by Professor Sunanda Mahendra and other like-minded writers. As things stood, though, it was never meant to be. He had scheduled it for April 7, but had to delay it because of a surgery -- one he would not recover from.?
I visited Premaranjith Tilakaratne for the last time on November 3. I remember the date because it was at his residence that I got the news of Amaradeva?s passing away. I remember it because I was so numbed and upset that I blurted out, ?They are leaving us!? I remember it because Premaranjith, who could be sentimental and unsentimental at the same time (a rare quality), replied, ?That is the way of the world.??
An entire generation started leaving us in 2015. Premaranjith belonged to that generation. He was not a populist. He couldn?t be. A populist panders to the conventional wisdom. He didn?t. He preferred instead to critique and to cross off. In the end he triumphed, on account mainly of the respect he won from even those he?d alienated. To be sure, he earned enough invective to be a cynic. But then he was never a cynic. He was always a realist and a pragmatist.?

Strict action against inciting communal tension: Govt.
	
The Cabinet today decided to take strict action according to the law against elements that attempt to create communal tension and disharmony in the country, the Government said today.
The Government accordingly will instruct all Police stations to be vigilant on those who attempt to create tension among communities and apply law strictly on them.
Cabinet Spokesman, Land and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka told a hastily convened news briefing in the Parliament Complex last afternoon that the Cabinet that met after the mini Cabinet reshuffle on Monday was concerned about the statements made by certain groups and individuals that had contributed to heightened the communal feelings.
?There are extremists in all parts of the country among all communities and they wait for opportunities to create ethnic unrest. They use the freedom given to them by this Government for their ulterior motives. But the Government is committed to ensure each and every citizen new freedom without hindrance from any party or group,? Minister Karunathilaka said.
The law enforcement authorities will act according to the law in a more vigorous manner to arrest this negative trend and maintain law and order and inter-communal harmony, Minister Karunathilaka stressed. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

The  Insurmountable  Socio - Economic  Impact of CKDU
	
Children neglected, their education disrupted,?families torn apart - as they all grapple with poverty and the grief of losing their loved ones?
Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Etiology(CKDu) has been the subject of much scientific research in the recent past. Though its cause is unknown its consequences are certain. CKDu kills the victim gradually and the family of the victim falls apart alongside, unable to bear the socio-economic burden. CKDu is incurable though the progression of the disease can be slowed down through treatment. It is rampant in areas dependent on farming. Generally the breadwinner, the father of the family contracts the disease. The whole family grapples with the disease trying to cure the victim. When the victim succumbs to the disease misery aggravates. Children drop out of school or neglect schooling to take care of the farm lands. Lands owned are sold or leased out to meet the daily financial requirements. As there is no income the son moves to Colombo to take up odd jobs, ultimately falling prey to drugs and alcoholism. Mothers migrate as housemaids. When one member is diagnosed with CKDu it also points to an inevitable truth that there could be others in the family with CKDu
If there is a family of ten, seven would have contracted the disease
- Harshana Suranga Seneviratne,?a university student?from Girandurukotte
Thus socio-economic consequences of contracting CKDu are manifold. When Thilanga was in Grade 10 his father was diagnosed with CKDu and he had to stay back to take care of the field. His teacher noticed Thilanga?s absence for two weeks and visited his house to discover the father ailing from CKDu. When the teacher inquired from the father about his son?s absence the father said, ?The child had at least a meal a day because of me. I can?t go to work in the field now. I can?t provide food. So I have no other option but to ask my only son to stay back and work in the field.? ??
Harshana Suranga Seneviratne, a university student from Girandurukotte narrating his experience at a discussion organized by the Law and Society Trust said that families are compelled to pawn their only bicycle, mortgage their house or plot of farm land as a consequence of the economic hardships resulting from the disease. ?Sometimes their children who are just 14 or 15 years in age come to Colombo and work as labourers in construction sites,? he said. ??
?Where the father is absent, the mother more often than not seeks foreign employment. Children drop out of school. There is a high chance that they will come to Colombo in search of employment and become drug addicts or drunkards. One day we will be talking about why this man turned into such an addict. Isn?t it better to prevent the consequences?? he added. ??
Speaking to Daily Mirror he narrated the sad plight of a young man in his early twenties who succumbed to the disease. ?After he was admitted to hospital, doctors said that his condition had worsened and was not treatable. Then he was discharged and subsequently passed away. His mother died unable to bear the grief. Ultimately their funerals were held on the same day,? he said. ?
He further said that in a family there were several members with CKDu which made the impact worse. ?If there is a family of ten, seven would have contracted the disease,? he said. ??
Causes unknown,?but assumed
According to data compiled by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Research numerous hypotheses have been put forward though none has been proven. Over the years research has pointed out that pesticides, fertilizers, drinking contaminated water, snake bites, fungal toxins, bacterial toxins, heavy metals, fresh water fish, heat and dehydration could be possible causes. It has also been suggested that CKDu is multi-factorial. ??Meanwhile local villages have come to conclusions about the cause of the disease through their experiences. Ven. Thissapura Ananda of the Girandurukotte Rakkitha Viharasthanaya who has donated a kidney and visits the Kandy Nephrology Unit every now and then for follow ups said that drinking contaminated water was the main cause for CKDu. Speaking about the diverse views on the causes of CKDu he said that people believed cooking food in aluminum utensils and consuming fresh water fish caused CKDU. ??
?
Drinking contaminated water is the main cause for CKDu
-Ven. Thissapura Ananda of the Girandurukotte Rakkitha Viharasthanaya
Farmers should be aware of the direction of the wind when spraying weedicides, so as to prevent the chemical reaching the skin of the sprayer. But Ven. Ananda pointed out that farmers did not follow such practices due to convenience and ultimately put their lives at risk. ?Farmers generally spend the whole day at the farm. They chew betel, drink a plain tea, and have their lunch at the field. Thus the risk of contamination is high,? he said. He further said that the attitude to maximize cultivation in the available plot to receive maximum profits has led to the current state of affairs. ??
Terrance Gamini, an Activist based in the North Central Province who has worked at the laboratory of the Anuradhapura General Hospital for 25 years said by about 1993 people were diagnosed of CKD though they were not diabetic or hypertension patients. ?This was the time when agro-chemicals were used widely,? he said, implying that the use of agro-chemicals was the main cause. ??
For the past four years Gamini has been involved in conducting clinics in villages. Along with the assistance of specialist doctors they have organized clinics in Anurahapura, Pollonnaruwa and Vavuniya. Speaking about his observations in these villages he said that the main short coming that led to the aggravation of the disease was the lack of clean water for drinking. ?Farmers are hesitant to drink water because of the abnormalities of the water found in that area. For instance, Rajanganaya is an area where water is abundant. But agro-chemicals are used abundantly as well. Annually 50kg of agro chemicals is sprayed on an acre of banana plants,? he said. ??
?
When malnutrition and dehydration combine CKDu is aggravated
- Terrance Gamini,?an Activist
Reminiscing his young days Gamini said that when they were thirsty they used to cup water from a nearby spring and drink. ?Back then springs and waterways running through farms were not polluted. After the introduction of agro-chemicals we have become hesitant to drink water as the water that runs by is polluted. Now farmers work without drinking water, and they get dehydrated. They suffer from malnutrition as well. When malnutrition and dehydration combine CKDu is aggravated,? Gamini noted. ??
Explaining further on how kidneys are affected Gamini said that usually when a person vomits continually for several days his kidneys shut down temporarily because of dehydration. However the person recovers once saline is administered. ?But if a person doesn?t drink water for a longtime, it is worse than dehydration,? he said. ??
He further pointed out that in areas where water is obtained mainly through tanks the concentration of the water increased and became undrinkable, once the rainy season has passed. ?People in these areas don?t even drink one litre a day,? he said. ??
Highlighting certain misconceptions which aggravated the disease Gamini pointed out that as CKDu is considered to be incurable people do not go to clinics and test themselves. ?Then when the condition becomes worse and visible, when the areas around your eyes, knees, and stomach are swollen the victim consults a doctor to discover that his kidneys are 90% dysfunctional, and will die within a month. If you diagnose the disease in the initial stages you can prevent the disease aggravating without taking any medication. But when we hold a clinic only the elderly take part, others are occupied,? he said. ??
Some also believe that CKDu is caused by medicine prescribed for diabetes and hypertension. ?As a result those who have been on medication stop taking them. If you stop the drug for hypertension your kidney will become dysfunctional within a year,? Gamini pointed out. ??
Gamini believes that consuming freshwater fish does not cause CKDu. Substantiating his claim he indicated how fishermen who fish in the Padaviya tank consumed at least 2kg of fish a day, and that there has not been a single case of CKDu reported. ??
?
They are hesitant to admit that CKDu is caused by fertilizers and agro-chemicals because multi-national companies have sealed their lips!
- Sena Ranasinghe from Girandurukotte
Sena Ranasinghe, the President of the Trading Society of Girandurukotte told Daily Mirror that 98% in Girandurukotte were farmers and that even children have been diagnosed of the disease. ?The water here contains calcium oxalate, fluoride, arsenic and cadmium. If we decide to stop using pesticides tomorrow it will take another 300 years to remove the pesticides that have already been absorbed by the ground. Only 30% is absorbed by plants when pesticides are used. Ten percent evaporates. The rest 60% gets added to ground water,? he pointed out. ??
?Glyphosate is banned now. But there are other pesticides which are fifteen times more severe which are available in markets. The cause is clear, but they are not admitted in public. They are hesitant to admit that CKDu is caused by fertilizers and agro-chemicals because multi-national companies have sealed their lips!? alleged a bitter Ranasinghe. ??
Prevention
Chronic Kidney Disease can be prevented by controlling the risk factors. However in the case of CKDu as the cause is unknown controlling risk factors is not possible, though assumed risk factors can be controlled, which may or may not yield positive results. A patient diagnosed with latter stages of CKDu will have to undergo either a kidney transplant, or dialysis(haemo-dialysis and peritoneal dialysis). ??
?Once the condition is aggravated you have to undergo haemodialysis every three days. But there are no facilities in government hospitals. Some people undergo hemodialysis only once in four days. Some don?t do it at all. A person above 60 years of age is not given the facility to undergo haemodialysis,? said Gamini. ??
He further revealed that there was an acute shortage of dialysis machines in the Anuradhapura Hospital. ?There are 25 haemodialysis machines in the Anuradhapura Hospital. You can only do a total of 75 dialyses a day. As a person has to undergo this treatment every three days only 250 can really benefit. It is only when one of the 250 dies that another gains access. This is the reality,? Gamini noted.He said that if haemodialysis was considered to be the solution, then at least 500 machines were needed. ??
Chronic kidney disease can be diagnosed through a blood test. Pointing out the disparity of benefits between city dwellers and villages Gamini said that though the technology to take 25 tests out of 1ml of blood is available, it was not available in villages where the need is direly felt. ??
Ranasinghe believes that the only viable solution is filtered water. ?Filters are being set up everywhere in the village.Though people drink filtered water they use toxic water when cooking. Then the purpose behind setting up filters is lost,? he said. He further explained that as only women attended awareness programmes men were not aware of the value of a filter, and therefore people did not purchase filters which are lifesaving equipment in the area. ??
?
Children and others in the families of those diagnosed with CKDu should be directed to doctors
- Amitha Ekanayake, President of the Women Farmers? Association in Dambarawa
Amitha Ekanayake, the President of the Women?s Farmer?s Association in Dambarawa said that people should adopt good health practices. ?Vegetables and fruits may contain traces of agro-chemicals. Therefore they should be washed well,? she said. ??
She further added that children and others in the family of those diagnosed with CKDU should be directed to doctors early on. ??
Addressing CKDU
Meanwhile the government provides several concessions to those affected. The Ministry of Social Welfare provides Rs.3000 for a family with a CKDU patient. According to Lalith Bandara, the Assistant Secretary to the President, who is attached to the Presidential Task Force, this amount will be increased to Rs. 5000. ?
?If one of the parents has died of CKDu the child who is pursuing his advanced level studies will be given Rs. 3000 monthly through the Presidential fund. At the moment around 100 students benefit,? he told Daily Mirror.
Combating CKDU is considered to be a cross ministerial duty. ?We have introduced a loaning facility for those pursuing self-employment through the Ministry of Social Welfare. There is a programme in place by the Ministry of Housing and Constructions to build houses for low income CKDu victims. The budget has allocated Rs.500 million for this purpose. The Ministry of Water Supply has targeted to provide clean water to areas where the need is direly felt by 2020,?Bandara said. He added that there was a shortage of specialist doctors and nursing staff to treat CKDu. ??
Further, the budget for 2017 has allocated Rs. 750 million to the Ministry of Health, to address the issues of CKDu. A further Rs. 100 million has been allocated to the National Science Foundation (NSF) to facilitate research mainly in CKDu. According to data collected by the Ministry of Health 26 943 CKDu patients were detected by December 2015. ??
?The most number of patients are reported from Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa. There are also patients from Badulla, Moneragala, Trincomalee, Ampara, Mannar, Vavuniya, Kilinochchi, Kurunegala and Hambanthota. ??

Thousands badly affected by doctors' strike
	
Thousands of hapless patients were once again badly affected by the token strike launched by the GMOA.
GMOA Secretary Navin De Soyza said the token strike was launched against the police attack on university students, the government's failure to arrest those responsible for throwing a hand grenade at the Sri Lanka Medical Council and several other demands.
Patients at the OPD, clinics and cardio-thoracic units were among the most affected.
De. De Soyza said all childrens and maternity hospitals such as the Lady Ridgeway Hospital, De Soyza Maternity Hosptal, Castle Street Maternity Hospital, Sirimavo Bandaranaike Children?s hospital in Kandy, National Cancer Institute Maharagama, Thelippalai, Jaffna, and all Emergency Treatment Units and Accidents Services were kept open with a skeleton medical staff. Colombo National Hospital Director Dr. Anil Jasingha said routine surgeries had been postponed yesterday and the OPD, Cardiology Unit and the other clinics were not functioning and admission of patients had been suspended.

Trump?s visit to Israel-Palestinian territories: What to expect
	
?
JERUSALEM AFP May21, 2017-US President Donald Trump?s visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories on Monday and Tuesday will be closely scrutinised as he seeks ways to re-start peace efforts. ??
This year marks 50 years since the Six-Day War and the beginning of Israel?s occupation. Peace efforts have been at a standstill since a US-led initiative collapsed in 2014. Meanwhile, Israel and Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas, which runs the Gaza Strip, have fought three wars since 2008. ??
Trump has talked up his business experience in saying he wants to reach the ?ultimate deal ?Israeli-Palestinian peace?. ??
?Palestinian political scientist Ali al-Jarbawi said ?Triggering the start of a process does not mean taking it until the end,? said . ??
Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have not had substantive direct talks since 2010. Abbas says he is ready to meet Netanyahu under Trump?s peace efforts, and there has been speculation the US president could seek to arrange a meeting while in the region. But many analysts see the prospect?
as unlikely. ??
Trump sparked concern when he backed away from the long US commitment to a two-state solution to the conflict, saying he could support one state if it?meant peace.
