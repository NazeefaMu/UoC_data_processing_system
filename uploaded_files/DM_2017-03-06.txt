Apparels no longer viable export industry- PM
	
Sri Lanka cannot depend on apparel exports any-more and the time is ripe for the production of electronic items such as mobile phone accessories and even parts for robotic machines, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
Mr. Wickremesinghe made this remark at a ceremony to mark the 150th anniversary of St Marys College, Kegalle yesterday.
We asked the University of Harvard to carry out a study on Sri Lankas economy. The university in turn informed us that Sri Lanka should not rely on importing apparels any more. This is a correct assessment as Sri Lanka cannot compete with countries such as Bangladesh, where the wages are lower. Therefore we need to concentrate on new export items such as electronics. We can even start manufacturing parts for mobile phones or robotic machines," the Prime Minister said.
He said there was a lot of potential for the manufacturing of robotics as china has decided to use around 4000 robotic machines for production. There is potential for producing parts of electronic and other modern equipment. Parts of electronic and electrical goods and other modern equipment which are needed by Japan are manufactured in countries such as Thailand today," he said citing an example.
He also said technology would be introduced in schools soon.
Meanwhile, Minster of Education Akila Viraj Kariyawasam announced that the government would have to assist schools on a priority basis though many schools have asked for financial assistance. As many as 30 ministers and MPs come to me during public days asking for assistance for schools around the country but I will have to assist them on a priority basis" he said.
Chief Minister Sabaragamuwa Maheepala Herath said government should assist schools such as St Mary's College and thanked the Prime Minister for assisting this school.

Appoint SPC to probe H'tota Port deal: Gammanpila
	
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila today asked President Maithripala Sirisena to appoint a special presidential commission (SPC) to review the Hambantota Port Agreement, which would result in Sri Lanka losing Rs.1.4 trillion during the 99-year lease period.
He said the final agreement with Chinese Company had been approved by the Attorney General and awaits Cabinet approval.
In the wake of the agreement being concluded in favour of China, there is suspicion that someone may have received a commission from this deal. Therefore, we request the President to appoint a commission similar to the one appointed to look into the bond issue to review the port deal. If there is no corruption involved, the government should state the facts, he told a news conference.
He said only 80 per cent of the amount spent to create the harbour would be recovered from the deal and 1,060 hectares including a 55-hectare island had been given to China on a free hold basis.
The MP said 12 hectares of the port land had been leased out to Laugfs Gas Company in 2013 for an annual charge of Rs.7.5 million per hectare.
But in the latest deal, a hectare of land has been leased out to China for only Rs.988,000. Though the port would be given free to China, according to the agreement, Sri Lanka will have to pay the market price when re-acquiring, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

In his presentation of the annual work report to the National Peoples Congress  Chinas legislature  Prime Minister Li stressed that following the leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core was the first among the 17 tasks that China needed to accomplish.
He highlighted that achievement of other goals such as economic development and stable growth had to be coupled with Mr. Xis vision, thinking and principles.

Church inside Wilpattu: Remains unsolved
	
	Nine illegal contructions built duing past 3 years without DWC permission 
	

	Six acres to be officially handed over to the church from Wilpattu Lands 
	

	Environmentalists complained to Vatican Embassy against Chilaw Boship
	
The Pallekandal Catholic Church inside Wilpattu National Park made headlines after environmentalists raised concern that the constructions of the church were being expanded, destroying the natural beauty of Willpattu forest.

Despite environmentalists having held many conferences to raise public awareness and inform responsible government authorities, no action was taken by the relevant authorities. The church is believed to have religious and historical significance since the days of Indian Catholic Missionary Joseph Vaz before the establishment of Wilpattu as a NationalPark in 1938. 
According to an announcement by the Roman Catholic Church, Joseph Vaz who came to Sri Lanka in 1687 had visited Pallekandal and put up a little chapel. The chapel has now been revamped and is handled by the Parish Priest of St. Judes Church,Wanathawilluwa Father Prabath Sanjaya under the purview of the Chilaw Bishop Valence Mendis.  A small scale feast was annualy held at the Pallekandal shrine with a little number of villagers who set up temporary shelters, which were taken down after the feast. However, according to environmentalists claims, the church running within an area of less than a quarter of an acre, started to be expanded and renovated, causing damage to the wildlife in Wilpattu after 2011.

Expanded church premises
Pix by Pradeep Pathirana 

TheDaily Mirrorreceived a comprehensive document prepared by the Wanathawilluwa Divisional Secretarys Office regarding pre and post activities of the Pallekandal feast held in July, 2016.

	The main mass of the Pallekandal Church was planned through discussions with the Deputy Minister of the Tourism Development & Christian Religious Affairs Arundika Fernando in May, 2016. 
	

	During the discussions, issues pertaining to the devotees such as how to control the vehicle traffic, where to park the vehicles, arrange space to park them, repair work of the road used by devotees, building temporary toilets, providing food and drinking water facilities, constructing stalls, emergency health requirementsetc. were focused. 
	

	The repairing of the Puttalam-Mannar Road was done by the Road Development Authority (RDA) upon directions given by theDeputy Minister. 
	

	In June, 2016, giant water tanks were placed at the church premises after clearing the trees and plants in that particular area. 
	

The places where tents were set up during the feast
Another document prepared by the Parish Priest of Wanathawilluwa St. Judes Church Father Prabath Sanjaya also stated that the Puttalam-Mannar road was expanded by the RDA so that two vehicles could travel at the same time. The environmentalists slammed that the road which was first built by armed forces during the tough time of the LTTE war, was now expanded and renovated for the Pallekandal Church devotees by cutting trees in Wilpattu. 
When the Daily Mirrorvisited the Pallekandal Shrine, we witnessed several new constructions and some unfinished constructions. The vicinity of the church which was surrounded by plants and trees of the Wilpattu was now full of rubbish. Empty plastic cans, polythene bags and wastage have destroyed the natural beauty of the surroundings. Not only that, but also the foot prints of elephants could be seen all over the place. It proves that the elephants too roam in the church areas because it is their habitat. 
No cleaning activity was apparently carried out after the feast held in July, 2016 with the attendance of more than 30,000 people. More space for the people to set up tents was given by cutting trees. Equipment they used to cook was still seen on the ground of
the surroundings. 
Environmentalists maintain that unnecessary renovations were done under the blessings of the politicians who try to interpret this as a religious need forgetting the grave environmental damage caused to the wildlife of Wilpattu preservation. Legal Counsel Wardani Karunaratne of Environmental Foundation Ltd. (EFL) one of those organisations opposing the Pallekandal expansion, had told a news conference that the constructions of Pallekandal Church are in direct infringement of the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance. 
However, Wanathawilluwa Divisional Secretary H.M.S. Herath assured that the church authorities had sought the permission of the Department of Wildlife Conservation although she failed to present any legal document to show the given permission. She also said that they have informed the Land Commissioner regarding a request made by the Chilaw Bishop to grant six acres to the church. She added they couldnt do anything against the constructions at the church for two reasons; first, they are done with all political powers which she denied explaining more and the holy place had originated before the Wilpattu National Park was upgraded to National Park status in 1938. 

Expanded church premises
Meanwhile, Wilpattu Park Park Warden Manoj Widyaratne said they were at the moment seeking legal assistance to file a court case at Puttalam Court against the illegal constructions of the Pallekandal Church with the purpose of re-taking state owned land. 
There are nine constructions built during past three years adjourning the church without seeking legal permission from the relevant departments. We have been waiting too much until the unlawful constructions came to an end but to no avail. Despite several warnings to the church, they did not stop so that this has to be solved at legal level other than discussion level, he said. 
Elephants still come to the lands where the church is located. The foot prints of elephants can be seen all over the place. This is actually not a religious issue but an environmental one. We also want to stop this destruction by any means. Such anti-environmental activities should be stopped. The expansion of the church began several years ago until when it had only an old shrine. The further constructions were begun with the blessings of the government. The church had requested approval to use six acres for their religious activities but the approval was not granted. Incidentally, they use more than the requested extent of acres already in violation of the laws and regulations of the Flora and Fauna Act, he said. 
The Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS) had recently complained to the Vatican Embassy against the Chilaw Bishop who they said was responsible for the destruction caused to the national park. WNPS President Rukshan Jayewardene said they had a very productive discussion with the Bishop of Chilaw and his team, at the Vatican Embassy when the complaint was heard. 
We have pointed out violations of the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance and keeping the Forest Department which has no jurisdiction whatsoever over these lands or the Wildlife Department which has to uphold the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance without fear or favour. Being informed does not legitimise or legalise theseactivities, he said. 
Speaking on the Wanathawilluwa Divisional Secretary who is currently working on to give 6 acres to the church from Wilpattu Lands, Mr. Jayewardene of WNPS said neither the Wanathawilluwa Divisional Secretary nor President of Sri Lanka could request or seek permission for activities within a National Park. He said they did not have the authority to get land within a Gazetted National Park released for any purpose. 
A National Park has the highest level of protection afforded by the state to public access lands and is strictly governed by the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance which is the law governing all such lands. It is declared and maintained for the protection of all animals and plants falling within its boundaries and only secondarily to an area for human access and activity but strictly governed by the FFPO. Much of the confusion and problems arise when the law is not fully understood or not fully enforced, or in attempts to subvert or ignore it often by the very people charged with upholding those laws, he explained. The environmental organisations and the people who are concerned about the issue are still waiting until a responsible government authority solves the Pallekandal issue without dragging it more. 

We have no idea to expand the church

In an exclusive interview with the Daily Mirror, Bishop of Chilaw Valence Mendis denied all the allegations adding that he would look into the matter again and take necessary action if any illegal activity was going on.
We deny the allegation that damages were caused by activities relating to the church.
The people will not destroy the forest when they come for the mass. They come only for two or three days. I want to highlight that the allegations have been exaggerated. This is merely a religious matter.
We have absolutely no idea to expand the church as such. There are no more buildings in the church premises other than a water tank. The number of devotees coming to the church is increasing and I cant stop people coming. The repair work of the church was started soon after the war. The front verandah was the only expansion work done within the church premises after the war. Considering the convenience of the pilgrims when the mass is held, we got the admission from the authorities to set up an open verandah, the Bishop said. Commenting on a car park which was allegedly built by clearing trees and plants of the Wilpattu Park, he said it was not made a car park but just a naturally open spacein the forest.He said no trees were cut down to make a car park or for any other purpose. Emphasising that all these activities were done under the supervision of the Forest Department and Wild Life Conversation Department, he said that they would never break the law of the land for religious purposes.
I will look into the allegations whether any unpermitted structures have been put in the church premises without my permission. I would not allow anyone to fell trees in the Wilpattu National Park. We too love nature, the Bishop said.Meanwhile, he said that they had written to the President, requesting him to release six acres to the church adding that their only concern was to hold the mass properly for the devotees who come to Pallekandal annually.

FUTA threaten token strike; uncertainty over uni students' exams
	
The Federation of University Teachers Associations (FUTA) today threatened to go ahead with its planned trade union action on March 8 and 9 even though it might jeopardize the exams of undergraduates.
FUTA President Nirmal Ranjith Dewasiri told a media conference that not only the students but it would even hamper the work of the lecturers.
We have waited so long hoping that our demands will be granted. Students exams are also scheduled to be held on Wednesday and Thursday. We are aware that the examinations may be disrrupted and some of them may be postponed causing inconvenience to students. But there is nothing we can do, he said.
Dr. Dewasiri said just as the patients face difficulties when the doctors stop work, the students would suffer during the strike by FUTA.
FUTA Secretary Arjuna Parakrama said there was a crisis facing the Education and Higher Education sectors.
Government authorities lack a proper understanding of the university sector. Salary deductions made by the recent circulars brought university lectures to the same as other administrative officers, he said and added that they were demanding security and respect for their profession.
There are anomalies in vehicle permits, communication allowances and other privileges when compared with other administrative services. When the unity government was elected it promised to allocate six per cent from the GDP to the education sector. However, it has been reduced to 0.6 per cent, which clearly shows a breakdown in the entire system," Prof. Parakrama said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Govt. to amend OMP Act
	
The Government has drafted legislation to amend the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) Act and a gazette notice has been issued in this regard. The draft legislation will be presented in Parliament shortly.
The Government decided to set up the Office of Missing Persons last year through an Act of Parliament but it is not operational as yet.
The move to amend the Act comes in the wake of the UN Human Rights Office calling for speedy action in ensuring transitional justice. In 2015, the UN Human Rights Council adopted a resolution tilted, Promoting Reconciliation, Accountability and Human Rights in Sri Lanka to provide a framework for transitional justice including the setting up of four specific mechanisms. The Office on Missing Persons (OMP) is one of them.(Kelum Bandara)

Gurusinha aware of tough task
	
Asanka Gurusinha in his first interaction with the media since assuming duties as the manager of the national cricket team yesterday said that he is ready to take up the challenge in taking Sri Lanka cricket to the next level.
Its a big challenge and I know, he said. But with a structure in place and the support from Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), I believe we can achieve the objectives Sri Lanka Cricket have got right now. The World Cup in 2019 is our main target. I am glad to get the opportunity to work with some of the finest players. We will try and see whether we can improve a few things.
Gurusinha had not held any official positions with SLC since leaving to Australia soon after Sri Lankas World Cup victory in 1996 but revealed there were several approaches in the past.
 Even the two gentlemen sitting either side of me (pointing to SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala (right) and Aravinda de Silva--the head of Cricket Committee (left) asked me to come back, so as several others after that. But I thought this is the right time, Gurusinha said at a press conference in Colombo.
I am very excited to accept this role. Aravinda is my close friend and we have known each other from our school days. He was my captain when we represented Sri Lanka at the Under-19 level. Glad to join the board (SLC) and work alongside him. There are some amazing people working to improve our cricket like Aravinda and Sanath who is the Chairman of Selectors. Sanath changed the way cricket is played. He was a young player when I was reaching the twilight of my career and I am amazed at how far he has come, he added.
Gurusinha, a steady number three batsman was roped in as part of SLCs restructuring process and will coordinate all cricket related matters. We are in the process of restructuring our cricket and the arrival of Asanka Gurusinha is part of that. We are keen to get our best brains to help develop our cricket. Asankas role will be one where he will co-ordinate with selectors, the team, High Performance Manager and the board (SLC), said SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala.
Gurusinha is the latest of the World Cup winning cricketers to join ranks with the current cricket administrators, following Aravinda, Sanath, Chaminda Vaas, Romesh Kaluwitharana, Hashan Thilakeratne and Upul Chandana who worked in different capacities and Sumathipala said the doors are even open for Arjuna Ranatunga to join hands with the board to work for the good of the game.
Aravinda de Silva, the head of cricket committee has apparently masterminded Gurusinhas appointment as he believes Gurusinha could toughen up the mental strengths of the players.
I have worked with most of the players who are the in the senior team at the moment when they were at under-19 level. What I sensed those days was that they werent mentally tough. The guys who are doing well now are the ones who are mentally stronger. The others will fade away. The sport needs guys who are mentally strong and I cant think of anyone else than Asanka to toughen them up. He was mentally the toughest guy I played with, De Silva said.
He has played some extraordinary innings on some difficult wickets. The hundred he scored at the MCG in a Test match in 1995 is one of the finest I have seen. It was on a green top and I was struggling. Asanka went ahead of me and made it look all too easy. Tactically he is one of our finest brains. He is a perfect team man as well, de Silva added.
Gurusinhas contracts runs until the 2019 World Cup.
Soon after the media briefing Gurusinhe left straight to Galle with Jayasuriya to join the Sri Lanka team, training ahead of the opening Test against Bangladesh on Tuesday.(Champika Fernando)

Man drinks an entire bottle of tequila in one go to win a $630 bet and  DIES moments later
	

It was the bet to end all bets, and ultimately a mans life. 
A 23-year-old man died from alcohol poisoning after chugging an entire bottle of tequila in a Dominican nightclub. 
Kelvin Rafael Meja decided to down the lot as part of a friendly wager between friends. 
The insane bet was all caught on camera and then posted online. The video caught the moment Kelvin completed the challenge of drinking the tequila straight from the bottle. 
But no sooner had the Kelvin won $630 and had the money in his hand, he fainted and collapsed to the floor and never regained consciousness. 
After finishing every last drop and handed his winnings, just seconds later he is barely able to stand and has to be helped up by two men. Shortly afterwards, he died. The Dominican Republics medical examiner revealed that the man died from alcohol intoxication. 
According to El Universal, the bet came about after Mejia approached a table where a group of clients were betting money on how much tequila they could drink in one go and he asked to join in. 
The management of the venue, the Vacca Lounge, has distanced itself from the events stating the nightclub had nothing to do with the tragic incident.

Missed calls: Man hacks wife with axe
	
A fifty-one-year old man, who had discovered two missed calls on his 47-year-old wife's mobile phone, had gone into a rage cut off a part of her hair in anger and then proceeded to strip her naked before striking her with an axe, thereby causing her severe injuries. The man was arrested and ordered to be remanded till tomorrow (7) by Gampola Magistrate Chandani Meegoda.
The injured woman was admitted to the Gampola Hospital, police said. The suspect is a resident of Rathmalkaduwa in Gampola.
He was a mason bass and was suffering from a back injury he had incurred after falling from a scaffolding.
It was revealed that since his injury he had been very careful to stop his wife, who was quite a good looking woman, from wandering too far away from home. He also took pains to check her phone for calls from people he did not know and when he saw the two missed calls he completely lost it.
He was said to have got into an argument with his wife over a missed call she had received and this had led to him physically abusing her, compelling her to leave the house and go over to live with her married daughter in Rathmalkaduwa.
He had then gone over to his daughters house to ask his wife for a divorce. He had later hacked her with an axe.
Following the incident he had left the area to avoid being captured by the police who never-the-less arrested him from his hideout in Gampola.(Suranga Rajanayaka)

The Pope wants couples to have fewer children in order to lessen the environmental damage being done to the planet, a Vatican panel has been told. 
Environmentalist Peter Raven made the comment at a workshop on biodiversity, which discussed Catholic Church attitudes toward environmental issues. 
Pope Francis has previously said avoiding pregnancy is not an absolute evil, but the church remains unwavering in its opposition to artificial birth control.Dr Raven stated, LifeSiteNews reports: Pope Francis has urged us to have fewer children to make the world more sustainable. 
But he continued: We do not endorse any of the artificial birth control [methods] that the Church does not endorse. 
Dr Raven stated, according to the sites account of the workshop, that we need a more limited number of people in the world. 
At the same Biological Extinction workshop, a paper was presented by Dr Paul Ehrlich, who argued that Catholic teachings had resulted in collective failure to reduce the worlds population.In a press conference onboard a flight last year, Pope Francis said abortion is a crime and absolutely evil, but he added: Paul VI, a great man, in a difficult situation in Africa, permitted nuns to use contraceptives in cases of rape.

## Title: round-the-world flight of  plane crewed by women

round-the-world flight of  plane crewed by women
	

Air India has made history by completing its first ever around-the-world flight run entirely by an all-woman crew. 
The plane travelled from Delhi to San Francisco and everyone involved was female - from the captain to the ground crew and check-in staff. 
The airline has applied for a Guinness World Record and now plans to operate similar flights as a way of celebrating International Womens Day on March 8th.Even the bag handlers and air traffic control dispatchers were women - as well as the customer care staff. 
Air India had pledged to boost recruitment of female staff with numbers at the airline rocketing to 20 per cent this year from as little as five per cent in the past. 
But the numbers in India are well above the global average - with just one in 33 pilots around the world being a woman.The Boeing 777-200LR plane covered a distance of about 9,500 miles in 15-and-a-half hours and was captained by Kshamata Bajpayee. 
She said: The flight is a symbol of women empowerment and it will encourage women to step out of their comfort zone and succeed in male-dominated arenas too. 
The entire message is actually to encourage young girls who have dreams of getting into the skies and they feel its too technical or this is something only men do.This flight is a symbol that every single male-dominated function can be carried out by women safely and efficiently. 
She continued: Only when you wish can you be granted that wish. Only when you dream can that dream come true, it has come true for me.It comes just days after two women made airline history for a different reason after becoming the first two black female pilots to fly together in a cockpit. 
First Officer Dawn Cook contacted Stephanie Johnson after learning she would be flying out of Detroit on Sunday last week for Delta Airlines.The two pilots then organised the historic flight and posed for beaming selfies.

Trumps baseless wiretap claims
	

By Philip Rucker, Ellen Nakashima,
Robert CostaBodymatter 
President Donald Trump on Saturday angrily accused former president Barack Obama of orchestrating a Nixon/Watergate plot to tap the phones at his Trump Tower headquarters in the run-up to last falls election, providing no evidence to support his explosive claim and drawing a flat denial from Obamas office. 
Ben Rhodes, a longtime national security adviser to Obama, tweeted at Trump: No President can order a wiretap. Those restrictions were put in place to protect citizens from people like you. Neither Trump nor his aides offered any citation to back up Trumps accusation about Obama.
Trump may have been prompted by a report on the conservative website Breitbart and commentary from talk radio host Mark Levin suggesting that the Obama administration used police state tactics to monitor the Trump team. The Breitbart report circulated among Trumps senior aides Friday and early Saturday, and Trump may have simply been reacting to the piece when he took to his preferred megaphone, Twitter, to trumpet his claim. 
Levelling the extraordinary allegation about his predecessor in a series of four early morning tweets, Trump said Obama had been wire tapping his New York offices and suggested that the former president had meddled with the very sacred election process. Obamas supposed actions, Trump said, amounted to McCarthyism.
