## Title: Customs seize Rs.1Mn worth illicit fags and cardamom at BIA

Customs seize Rs.1Mn worth illicit fags and cardamom at BIA
	
Two local traders who attempted to smuggle in a stock of illegal cigarettes and cardamom worth over Rs.1 million was intercepted by the Customs officials at the Bandaranaike International Airport this morning.
The two Sri Lankans who were returning from Dubai after a short visit had reportedly arrived at the country on FlyDubai flight FZ 547 around 6.30a.m.
Customs Spokesman Deputy Director Sunil Jayaratne told the Daily Mirror, that the men were stopped and searched on suspicion at the arrival lounge and recovered the contraband being concealed in their baggage.
The sleuths recovered 112 cartons and several more single packets of Dubai brand of Gold Leaf containing 28,160 sticks of cigarettes, of which, the sale and importation to Sri Lanka was strictly prohibited.
They also found 30 kilos of cardamom in the baggage which had been brought along without an Import License.
MrJayaratne said a special license was required to obtain from the Department of Agriculture to import a speciality crop such as cardamom to Sri Lanka as it was widely grown here.
Even the license to import cardamom is issued on special grounds, such as research material or to meet a severe shortage within the local industry, which is highly unlikely, DDC Jayaratne said.
However, the Customs suspected that the passengers had attempted to smuggle in the cardamom as its local price was fairly high as a speciality spice. In some countries like Turkey and India the cost of cardamom is relatively low and the market prices too are very low, he said.
The seized goods had been valued at Rs.1, 020, 000 and the case had been detected by Assistant Superintendent of Customs G. B. C. Bandara.
Deputy Director of Customs Darshana Silva conducted the inquiry and released the two traders aged 33 and 41 respectively from Kotugoda and Kurunegala on a penalty of Rs.150, 000.
The contraband were forfeited by the Customs. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

Excise notification, imposing restriction on females: SC fixes rights petition for May 21
	
Supreme Court fixed for support on May 21 for granting of leave to proceed with the fundamental rights petition challenging the Excise Notification, imposing a restriction on females, allegedly discriminating them.
The bench comprised Justices Eva Wanasundera, Nalin Perera and L.T.B. Dehideniya.
Womens rights groups and activists are up in arms lamenting that the impugned notification is an infringement of basic human rights and dignity of women.
Petitioners nitpick that the impugned notification of the Minister of Finance and Mass Media Mangala Samaraweera is to re-impose and revive most disastrously, the purported restriction/prohibition imposed on the engagement and employment of women in the manufacture, collection, bottling, sale or transport of liquor.
They also nag that the restriction/prohibition that no liquor shall be sold or given to a woman within the premises of a tavern, thereby infringing the fundamental rights of women to equal protection and equality guaranteed under Article 12 of the Constitution as well as the right to engage in a lawful occupation, trade or business of their choice.
They state that consequent to the Cabinet decision, the Minister purportedly issued the said impugned Excise Notification.
They indict that the impugned notification amounts to ex-facie and de jure (legally) gender-based discrimination, infringing the rights of adult women.
They bemoan the Minister by the said notification superseded a draconian and archaic excise notification that blatantly demeaned and discriminated against women.
Women & Media Collective, Centre for Womens Research, Prof. Camena Guneratne and Sulakshana de Mel (Directresses of Womens Education & Research Centre) and 11 others filed the petition.
They cited Minister Mangala Samaraweera, Treasury Secretary Dr R..H.S. Samaratunga, Commissioner General of Excise Mrs K.H.A. Meegasmulle, Attorney General and others as Respondents.
Presidents Counsel Sanjeeva Jayawardane appeared for the Petitioners.(S.S. Selvanayagam)

Speaker's chopper spoils Avurudu celebrations
	
Matale International School laments that its annual New Year celebrations which was scheduled to be held on Saturday could not be held as a helicopter that carried Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had been kept landed in the venue of the celebrations.
The school's Director Prasana Dharmakeerthi told 'Daily Mirror' that the helicopter had been landed for over four hours at the Edward Silva Hokey Grounds where the celebrations were to be held.
He charged that despite his school having booked the ground a month ago after paying the due amount to the Matale Municipal Council, the students and their parents were disappointed to see the helicopter that had landed occupying the venue of the celebration.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had visited Matale for a function where a statue of Madugalle Nilame was unveiled by him at the Matale Public Library premises and the helicopter carrying him landed at the Edward Silva Grounds.
Mr. Dharmakeerthi said there were several other grounds in Matale for the helicopter to land. (Mahesh Keerthirathna)

Syria war: At least 70 reported dead in suspected gas attack
	
Rescuers and medics say at least 70 people have died in Syria in a suspected gas attack in Douma, the last rebel-held town in Eastern Ghouta.
Volunteer rescue force the White Helmets tweeted graphic images showing several bodies in a basement. It said the death toll is likely to rise.
There has been no independent verification of the reports.
Syria's government has called the allegations of a chemical attack a "fabrication".
The US state department said it is monitoring the "very disturbing" reports, and that Russia - which is fighting alongside the Syrian government - should be held responsible if deadly chemicals had been used.
"The regime's history of using chemical weapons against its own people in not in dispute," said the state department.
It said it believed at least 40 people died, but that the toll may be far higher.
Several medical, monitoring and activist groups reported details of a chemical attack, but figures vary and what happened is still becoming clear.
The pro-opposition Ghouta Media Center tweeted that more that 75 people had "suffocated" while a further thousand people had suffered the effects of the alleged gas attack.
It blamed a barrel bomb allegedly dropped by a helicopter which it said contained sarin, a toxic nerve agent.
The Union of Medical Relief Organizations, a US-based charity that works with Syrian hospitals, told the BBC the Damascus Rural Specialty Hospital had confirmed 70 deaths.(BBC)

Work to rule protest by CEB Engineers
	
The Engineers of Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) have decided to engage in a work to rule trade union action within two weeks.
The Chairman of the Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers Union Saumya Kumarawadu said their intended trade union action was decided upon the non-responsiveness of the CEB with regard to their proposals on executing long-term power generation plants and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) power generation plants.
CEB authorities show a lethargic attitude to install long-term power generation plant but are interested in plans to buy electricity from profiteering private companies and gain commissions, he alleged.
He further said a letter has also been sent by the union to President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe stressing the need of stipulating an LNG power plan suitable for the country and preparing an appropriate procedure to be adapted in purchasing electricity thus generated.
