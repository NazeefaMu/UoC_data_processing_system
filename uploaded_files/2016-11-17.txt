The Rising Terror of TB
	
What is TB?
?
Tuberculosis is a curable and preventable disease caused by bacteria that affects the lungs of a person with low immunity.?
?
By Sarah Muiz
Tuberculosis, a disease caused by the bacteria commonly known as Mycobacterium Tuberculosis affects the lungs of a person with low immunity. The disease is currently on the rise countrywide due to various factors including a lack of awareness, low immunity and low nutritional levels.
Nevertheless, there is nothing to fear as long as one?s immunity is strong enough to battle the disease.The Global Tuberculosis Report 2016 released by the World Health Organization notes that there were an estimated 10.4 million new TB cases identified worldwide in 2015, of which 5.9 million were identified among the male population, 3.5 million among the female population and 1.0 million cases among children. The Report also indicates that there were an estimated 480,000 new cases of multidrug- resistant TB patients identified in 2015 and an estimated 1.4 million TB deaths recorded worldwide in the same year. ??
?
What are the leading causes giving rise to TB?
In a candid interview with Daily Mirror, Chief Medical Officer of the Colombo Municipal Council Dr. Ruwan Wijayamuni highlighted several key features related to Tuberculosis, while underlining the factors that have led to an increase of Tuberculosis cases evident in Sri Lanka lately. ?Most of us have inhaled the Mycobacterium Tuberculosis at some point in our lives. However, we will not contract the disease as long as our immunity is at an adequate level and is strong enough to fight and kill the bacteria. Comparatively, those with low or diminished immunity are vulnerable to the disease. ??
The number of people with low immunity levels is gradually increasing in society due to the high prevalence of diabetes, which is steadily growing. Secondly, drug addicts drawn to drugs such as heroin and cannabis can also have a very low immunity level. People representing a marginal community from the lower economic strata are also vulnerable to Tuberculosis and various other diseases. Their immunity and nutritional levels are generally poor due to poverty. Very often, they cannot afford to consume nutritional food and medicine, thereby making their immune system more vulnerable to disease. These people, such as residents of shanties, are exposed to constant environment pollution ?with little domestic facilities and very poor ventilation. These are the main reasons for the steady rise in Tuberculosis? Dr. Wijayamuni said. ??
In the event a person in this environment has contracted Pulmonary Tuberculosis/ Tuberculosis of the Lungs, he or she can easily spread the disease to another. As pointed out by Dr. Wijayamuni, when Mycobacterium Tuberculosis attacks the lung tissues thereby dissolving the alveoli walls, cavities are formed within the lungs. These cavities are dense with the bacteria Mycobacterium Tuberculosis. Therefore, when a person infected with Tuberculosis coughs, millions of bacteria are released into the air and if someone in close proximity breathes this air, he or she can also contract the disease. This is generally known as Airborne Droplet Infection meaning the disease is spread through the air. The tiny droplets released into the air when coughed will contain thousands of micro bacteria. These droplets with bacteria can land in a healthy individual?s nasal cavity and find its way into the lungs. If the person?s immunity is low, the disease will thrive and conquer the lungs, causing the Tuberculosis disease. ?
?

Symptoms of TB
Symptoms of TB include a prolonged cough that lasts for more than a week, perspiring during the night and loss of appetite. Occasional fever and cachectic conditions symbolizing wasting or extreme loss of weight could also reflect symptoms of Tuberculosis. In critical cases, symptoms may also include cough ensued with blood/ coughing up blood; a medical condition commonly known as ?Haemoptysis?. This is an indication that the person is suffering from open type, Pulmonary Tuberculosis. ??
There are different types of TBs including TB of the spinal cord, bones and kidney. According to Dr. Wijayamuni, this kind of TB is generally known as Extra Pulmonary Tuberculosis. In the case of Open Pulmonary Tuberculosis, the disease is open to the environment and can spread to others as well. ??
?
Treatment
As part of the treatment process, Dr. Wijayamuini said patients are given a multi-drug treatment that should be continued until the disease is completely cured. Proper continuation of treatment is important to prevent the patient from developing drug resistance. It should be noted that Micro bacterium Tuberculosis can easily develop resistance to certain antibiotics. In Colombo, nearly ten percent of those diagnosed with the disease discontinue treatment at some point before the diseases is completely cured. Dr. Wijayamuni stressed that the TB treatment should be continued for six months until the disease is hundred percent cured. ??
?A patient who discontinues treatment after a month is more like a TB terrorist because the disease can easily spread within society. In the event the treatment is taken only for a month or two and discontinued afterwards, the bacterium acquires resistance against the particular drug initially used for treatment. If an individual with weak immunity contracts the disease from such a patient, he or she will be diagnosed as a Multidrug Resistant TB patient. ??
Multidrug Resistant TB patients eventually die because they are immune to the treatment that is generally prescribed for normal TB patients. This is mainly because there is no proper treatment available for drug-resistant TB patients. It should be noted that there aren?t very many drugs that can cure this particular TB type that is resistant to all other treatments available in the world. This is a very critical situation and nearly ten percent of our patients in this category have been thus named ?Defaulters?. The defaulter rate in Colombo is nearly 9.8, while on a country?s scale, this rate is close to five percent? Dr. Wijayamuni said. ??
?
Challenges in curtailing TB
The complexity Sri Lanka faces with regard to Tuberculosis is the difficulty in keeping track of patients? whereabouts in order to curtail the disease from spreading further and help them continue with their treatment routinely. According to Dr. Wijayamuni, this is mainly because some patients are migrant workers from either neighboring countries or from distant parts of the country who do not stay in one place for long. Very often, such patients return to their homeland as half-treated patients hence carrying the risk of spreading Mycobacterium Tuberculosis within their community. ?This is something similar to a terrorist who goes to a remote area and plants hand grenades that would result in a big explosion. This is the challenge we are currently facing in Sri Lanka with regard to Tuberculosis. TB is mainly rampant in areas within North Colombo where the living standards are generally poor such as in Mutwal, Mattakkuliya and Grandpass. This situation is also evident in areas surrounding Maligawatte. Out of the 47 municipal wards, there are four wards that have been identified as high-risk zones for Tuberculosis? he said. ? ?The Public Health Department of the Colombo Municipal Council in collaboration with the Ministry of Health is conducting Mobile Chest Clinics for the public and the publicity for this campaign is usually carried out in a public place of the chosen location. If anyone in the chosen location is suffering from a cough for more than one week, they will be advised to visit the Mobile Chest Clinic in the vicinity for a free medical checkup. People should be constantly reminded of the risk of contracting Tuberculosis. More importantly, if someone in the community is suffering from prolonged cough for more than ten days, people should encourage that person to seek immediate medical advice. If an individual is diagnosed with Tuberculosis, his or her immediate contacts should also go for a medical checkup as a safety measure. Tuberculosis is hundred percent curable if the disease is diagnosed early and the treatment is continued for six months properly.
Currently, we have launched house-to-house campaigns in high-risk areas to raise more awareness on Tuberculosis and on how to take necessary precautions against the disease? Dr. Wijayamuni added. ?

Govt. to lease out vehicles for 58 MPs at Rs.700,000 a month
	
The move to lease out vehicles to 58 government MPs at a total cost of Rs.2.4 billion gives room to suspect of their being a serious financial crime involved, Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake told Parliament today.
"The fact that tenders had been called from potential suppliers even before cabinet approval is a matter for suspicion," he said.
"The monthly rental for one vehicle will amount to Rs.700,000 and at the end of the lease period of 60 months the total amount paid for each of the vehicles will add up to Rs.42 million. This means that the 58 vehicles will end up costing Rs.2.4 billion," Mr. Dissanayake said adding that the government would not receive ownership of the vehicles after the lease was paid up.
Meanwhile, Mr. Dissanayake highlighted the fact that the 58 MPs were being currently paid a monthly transport allowance of Rs.200,000.
Mr. Dissanayake questioned whether the government is actually going ahead with the proposal, as to whether these MPs have asked for vehicles and as to whether the costs involved is correct.
Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella who responded said Minister of Finance Ravi Karunanayake will make a statement on it in the House today. (Yohan Perera)

Handle With Care
	
?
Antibiotics are prescribed to kill or inhabit bacteria during a bacterial infection. Antibiotic resistance, however, where bacteria becomes resistant to antibiotics, has become a major health threat worldwide. Experts have pointed out that there is a lack of investment to produce new antibiotics. Therefore if antibiotics are not handled cautiously, this could result in irreversible and drastic consequences. Against such a backdrop, the World Health Organization has declared this week World Antibiotic Awareness Week. Daily Mirror spoke to Dr. Kushlani Jayatilleke, Consultant Microbiologist at the Sri Jayawardanapura General Hospital, who also functions as an Assistant Secretary to the Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA). She explained the extent of the problem and suggested the best practices to curb antibiotic resistance. ?
?
?
QWhat are the consequences of taking antibiotics unnecessarily?
Antibiotics were invented during the early part of the 20th century. If one uses too much antibiotics, their effectiveness is lost. The bacteria exposed to these antibiotics develop mechanisms to resist them. Antibiotics like penicillin which were very effective when they were discovered are no longer effective as a result. ??
Our body has a normal bacterial flora. They help maintain health and protect from infection. If antibiotics are taken unnecessarily, the protective bacteria could also be killed. If there are one or two antibiotic-resistant bacteria when antibiotics are taken, the beneficial bacteria would also be killed and the resistant bacteria will become prominent. They will multiply and form a population of resistant bacteria. ??
?
QHow do you prevent antibiotic resistance?
Antibiotics are not a treatment for fever as fever is not always due to an infection. Most infections are viral. Bacterial infections are very rare. Antibiotics will not help fight viral infections such as the common cold or influenza. People believe that if they take antibiotics, they can recover fast, so they request antibiotics from the doctor. This should not happen. ??
People should question doctors as to whether antibiotics are required if prescribed. Antibiotics should not be stored to be used later for a similar infection. One must not self-medicate as the disease could be diagnosed incorrectly. Medicines are prescribed according to the person as well. Certain antibiotics are not prescribed for children. If the patient is taking other drugs simultaneously, there is a possibility that these could interact. We take many factors into consideration when we prescribe an antibiotic. Antibiotics should not be bought from a pharmacy without the prescription of a doctor. ??
If an infection can be prevented, there will be no need for antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance will be reduced. So, proper hygienic measures and infection prevention measures are recommended. Vaccines will also help reyduce infections. ??
?
QWhat guidelines should be followed when a person is prescribed an antibiotic?
If an antibiotic is prescribed, it should be taken properly. The antibiotic should flow through the blood in the correct concentration and should also reach the target. For instance, the antibiotic should reach the urine in an urine infection. When it reaches the target, the concentration should remain high. This is why we need to take antibiotics on time, in correct amounts and not miss a dose. ??
One must also complete the course, unless there are bad side effects. If you have been asked to take it for five days, this should be followed. Even if you feel better you should continue, because if a bacterial infection is treated partially, it can come up again. Then the remaining bacteria will be more difficult to treat.
take it for five days, this should be followed. Even if you feel better you should continue, because if a bacterial infection is treated partially, it can come up again. Then the remaining bacteria will be more difficult to treat. ?
QWhat are the side effects of antibiotics?
Doctors should inform patients about the side effects likely to occur. Side effects are rarely severe. Apart from allergies, certain antibiotics can cause severe diarrhea. There can be small alterations in the bowel habit but sometimes it can be so serious that hospitalization is required. The condition can be fatal but fortunately, deaths occurring due to side effects of antibiotics are not common in Sri Lanka. When side effects are present the antibiotic should be stopped and one should see a doctor.
??QWhat are the extreme impacts of antibiotic resistance?
We have to use antibiotics in hospitals. If an infection is picked up from a hospital, the bacteria will become resistant to most antibiotics. We have this problem in most hospitals. Our surveillance programmes have shown that the resistance levels in Sri Lanka are very high. Some bacterial infections we acquire, especially from ICUs, are resistant to every antibiotic in the country. ??
New antibiotics are not invented to meet the rate of resistance of available antibiotics. There were a lot of antibiotics developed during the early part of the 20th century. But after 1960, we saw a very big gap where no new antibiotic came into the market. ??
?
QWhy is there less progress in the invention of new antibiotics?
When an antibiotic is developed, there is not much profit to be made, unlike medicines for cholesterol and diabetes which will be taken for the rest of your life. After spending so much on developing an antibiotic, other companies can produce the same drug for a cheaper price, once the original patency ends. It has been predicted that by 2050, deaths due to antimicrobial resistance in the world will overtake deaths due to cancer. The highest impact is predicted to be felt in Asia. ???

HNB 3Q profit up 50% to Rs.4bn over strong core banking operations
	
Hatton National Bank PLC (HNB), the second largest private lender with an asset base of Rs.819 billion, saw its September quarter (3Q16) net profit rising by as much as 50 percent to Rs.4.0 billion or Rs.9.71 a share from a year ago, amply supported by core banking operations and commission incomes, the interim results released to the Colombo Stock Exchange showed.
The bank on a standalone basis grew its loan book by Rs.45.8 billion or 9.0 percent during the nine months to September 30, 2016. The bank now has a total loan book of Rs.555 billion.
Rupee housing loans grew by Rs.2.6 billion, credit cards by around Rs.1.0 billion and overdrafts by Rs.11.3 billion.
This growth was strongly backed by deposits as they grew by over Rs.53 billion or 10 percent to end the nine months with a Rs.580.5 billion portfolio.
However, the low cost deposits measured by current and savings account (CASA) ratio dropped to 38.4 percent from 41.3 percent at the beginning of the year.
In October, the bank raised Rs.6.0 billion in subordinated debentures between 11.75 percent and 13.0 percent interest rates, which also could be utilized to lend while strengthening its capital base.?
The bank also managed to maintain the margins as the net interest margin (NIM) edged up to 4.30 percent from 4.10 percent at the start of the year. This is despite the industry average narrowing to just about 3.5 percent.
The net Interest income (NII) grew by 39 percent Year-on-Year (YoY) to Rs.10.4 billion while the net fee and commission income rose by 16 percent YoY to Rs.1.88 billion, providing a strong operating income base for the banking group.
Nevertheless, the bank?s trading portfolio booked a loss of Rs.707.9 million against a gain of Rs.1.32 billion during the corresponding period.
For the nine months this loss was Rs.1.27 billion and according to the bank this has stemmed from the ?mark-to-market of the swaps taken by the bank to hedge its foreign currency borrowings.?
Meanwhile, the unrealised gains made from the bank?s financial assets categorized under the available-for-sale category turned positive Rs.1.6 billion but for the nine months this was a loss of Rs.1.73 billion, up 9.0 percent from a year ago.
The bank?s available-for-sale assets largely comprise of equities, HNB said.
However, the other operating incomes during the quarter turned positive Rs.1.0 billion from a negative Rs.665.6 million a year ago, as a result of ?conversion gains from balance sheet foreign currency positions,? the bank said.
The banking group provided lesser amount in respect of losses expected from possible bad loans.
Despite the relatively strong growth in loans, the bank was able to contain the gross non-performing loan ratio to 2.18 percent from 2.43 percent at the beginning of the year, demonstrating the quality of its loan book.
Meanwhile, the cost-to-income ratio dropped to 43.6 percent from 48.5 percent during the nine months demonstrating increase in efficiency levels.
As of end September, the bank was well capitalized with its Tier I and Tier II capital adequacy ratios clocking in at 10.4 percent and 13.44 percent, respectively, when the regulatory minimums stand at 5.0 percent and 10.0 percent each.
Meanwhile, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the banking group made a net profit of Rs.10.7 billion or Rs.25.87 a share, up 53 percent from a year ago.
The NII rose by 30 percent to Rs.28.4 billion from a year ago.
Employees? Provident Fund, the state-controlled private sector pension fund, held 9.79 percent stake in the bank followed by 9.69 percent stake by the state-owned Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation by September 30.
Meanwhile, the business tycoon Harry Jayawardena-owned companies collectively held a 17.91 percent stake in the bank.

Steps have been taken to ensure that the Kaffir community of African origin which resides in Puttalam and elsewhere are given equal rights as other Sri Lanka citizens, Parliament was informed today.
Responding to an oral question raised by MP Buddhika Pathirana in the House, Industry and Commerce Deputy Minister Nimal Lansa said members of this community were given all rights and their children were being absorbed to schools while their culture had also been recognized as one that should be preserved.
The Deputy Minister said 35 Kaffir families lived in Puttalam now while a few members lived in the Galle and Hambantota District as well.
However, Mr Pathirana rejected these claims saying these people faced various difficulties. He said some of these people did not even have national identity cards.
He said Sri Lankans of Chinese origin who live in Colombo and a few descendants of the Portuguese were also facing similar issues.
Deputy Minister Lansa said he would look into such issues pertaining to this community if they were presented to the government.(Yohan Perera)

LankaPay to revolutionize retail payments landscape via JustPay
	
LankaClear Pvt Ltd, the operator of LankaPay ? Sri Lanka?s national payment network recently launched JustPay, an initiative to facilitate retail payments via disruptive technology innovations.?
The launch was held under the patronage of Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy, Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Chief Guest Wasantha Deshapriya, Secretary to the Ministry of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure, Guest of Honour during Infotel 2016 National IT exhibition where LankaPay took part as the co-sponsor of the start-up pavilion.
JustPay is a brainchild of LankaClear, an initiative that is aptly supported by the Central Bank and all the member banks of LankaPay Common Electronic Fund Transfer (CEFTS) to facilitate secure real-time retail payments below Rs.10,000 under an extremely low tariff scheme.?
Accordingly, customers will be able to make everyday payments by transferring funds directly from their accounts to merchants? accounts by using smart mobile phones and other smart devices. This is implemented as a highly secure payment mechanism with two factor authentication and end to end encryption in addition to further security measures taken by banks for mobile and internet based transactions.?
JustPay facilitates low value retail payments, direct debits or pull payments, to be enabled via smart devices (mobiles, tabs and kiosks etc.) or internet-based apps. There are already a few vendors who are working in partnership with LankaPay CEFTS member banks to introduce JustPay as a payment option for their services. Some of them also demonstrated their solutions at the LankaClear stall at Infotel 2016 exhibition.?
Lanka Clear anticipates that due to the extremely low transaction costs, innovative and convenient applications and highest level of security, JustPay will soon become the primary payment mechanism amongst Sri Lankans for retail payments. To make this happen, the payment applications have to be extremely simple to use, secure and must support local languages.

Paracetamol- use it wisely and never exceed the dosage
	
Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is a pain reliever and is used to treat conditions such as headaches, muscle aches, arthritis, backaches, toothaches, colds and fevers. It relives pain in mild arthritis but has no effect on the underlying inflammation and swelling of the joints. ??
However, using the medication more often than recommended may be detrimental to health. An overdose of paracetamol can cause serious harm. The maximum amount of paracetamol for adults is 1g (1000 mg) per dose and 4g (4000 mg) per day. Consuming paracetamol over the advised amount could cause damage to the liver. For those who drink more than three alcoholic beverages a day, a doctor should be consulted before taking paracetamol and should never be used over 2g (2000 mg) per day. ??
Paracetamol should be taken only if fever or body pains persist, as mentioned above. Once the fever has left and the pain has subsided, one should stop taking it. This is not to be treated as an antibiotic and taken as a course. Do not use any other over-the-counter cough, cold, allergy, or pain medication without first consulting your doctor or pharmacist. Paracetamol is present in many combination medicines. If you use certain products together you may accidentally consume too much paracetamol. Read the label of any other medicine you are using to see if it contains Paracetamol, Acetaminophen or APAP. Avoid drinking alcohol while taking this medication. Alcohol may increase your risk of liver damage while taking paracetamol. ??

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday was critical of Daily FT News paper of the Wijeya Newspapers Limited, over two opinion articles in Wednesday's issue on Government plans for Hambantota port and offers of tabs to students, likening the country's only national business daily to cheaper than toilet paper.
Referring to the opinion piece on Hambantota Port,?(Sale of Hambantota Port ? A fair deal?)?the Premier clarified that there was no sale but only a lease arrangement.
He claimed no one was selling the port but said the plan was to invite China Merchant to buy 80% of shares of Hambantota port for $ 1.1 billion, which would help the Balance of Payments.
The Prime Minister told the Business Today Awards that the country had got a white elephant port costing $ 1.3 billion for which debt has to be serviced. He said what is proposed was a better alternative than increasing more taxes to pay off debt. He said already there were many offers for new ventures in Hambantota such as an oil refinery, a dockyard, a cement plant and a LNG power plant.
The Premier was also critical of the opinion piece focusing on 2017 Budget move on granting tabs for students (Can tabs do what PCs or bricks could not do for education)?saying FT was even opposing that move when it was beneficial for all, rather than being exclusive resources limited only to the wealthy.
He concluded his comments on FT stating "Any way (such reporting) will help the FT to increase its circulation. I have asked the Finance Minister to put a 800% tax on Toilet paper, because FT will be the alternative."

SL?s high potential microinsurance industry needs enabling environment: expert
	
By Shabiya Ali Ahlam
Sri Lanka has been identified as a market that has huge potential for further growth in the microinsurance space, but requires an enabling environment and support if it is to pick up momentum, an international industry expert said yesterday.
Acknowledging microinsurance is still an infant industry in the island nation, Interim Executive Director Microinsurance Network Henk Van Oosterhout stressed that service providers continue to face plenty of obstacles, in areas such as technical know-how and regulation, which act as barriers and prevent the development of the sector that is much potential.?
Stating the sector is in its experimental stages; Oosterhout asserted there are a number of challenges and issues that calls for immediate attention.?
The primary challenge was identified as high administrative costs, due to which registered insurers are unwilling to market affordable microinsurance products to low income sectors as the transaction is not perceived as profitable.
?This has partly contributed to a concentration of insurance market in the upper and middle income groups, and the scarcity of services available to the lower income segment of the population,? explained Oosterhout, addressing the 12th International Microinsurance Conference in Colombo that was attended by over 400 delegates from 50 countries.
It was noted that the perceived low capacity of poor household to pay premiums also discourages insurance companies, thus leads to a vicious circle.?
?Insurance education is not up to mark and has resulted on insufficient insurance buy in,? asserted the expert.
While the enrollment process in microinsurance is not customized to fit the understanding of the poor, there is insufficient focus on institutions and regulation for the promotion of microinsurance, he added.
Furthermore, it was pointed out that due to the lack of a regulatory framework, a number of private companies are unwilling to engage in microinsurance.
?The vision of microinsurance has not extended beyond simply providing loan protection cover,? stressed Oosterhout.
Identified as a serious setback in the expansion of the sector was also the lack of skilled manpower and funding. The dearth of these two elements is said to have hampered the development of new products and the modification of existing products according to the prevalent need.
Despite the challenges, statistics show that in Sri Lanka, the number of registered microinsurance policies has witnessed a sharp increase where it has grown from 0.35 million in 2013 to 1.4 million in 2015, excluding informal coverage.
The maximum increase is attributed to personal accident covers which increased from 0.17 million in 2013 to around 0.84 million in 2015, an increase of 58 percent.
Meanwhile, total microinsurance written premium amounted to almost US $ 16 million in 2015. Companies that offer microinsurance have reported that microinsurance gross written premium accounted to an average of 6 per cent of their total premium of US $ 266.2 million in 2015.
While the market in Sri Lanka is noted to be almost entirely commercially-driven, claims ratios across product lines have an average of about 34 percent.

SLPP was born out of the SLFP: Basil
	
The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), the newly formed political party, in its maiden news conference today described itself as the natural home of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and invited former president Mahinda Rajapaksa to lead the party.
Former minister and SLPP front-liner Basil Rajapaksa said the launching of the new party was a timely need of the people because the country?s national security and economy were at risk because ofgovernment action.
?Our main intention is not to win the upcoming election. But as a party, we intend moving forward under the guidance and vision of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa. Unlike the other political parties the SLPP?s sovereignty is centered round its members,? Mr. Rajapaksa said.
Mr. Rajapaksa said the SLPP would move ahead by strengthening its own identity even though it had itsrootsin the SLFP and added that they would rectify past mistakes which led to their defeat at the previous election and make the SLPP a victorious in the future. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

SLPP will end up like any other bankrupt party: Vijith
	
Minister Vijith Wijayamuni De Soyza today said the newly formed Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) will end up like any other bankrupt political group that attempted to destroy the two main political parties, the UNP and the SLFP in the past.
He opined that the main reason for the possible failure of the SLPP was that, it had no vision, no policy or no ideology. It's only objective was revenge and an attempt to get out of the mess the members like GL, Basil and few others are in.
Addressing the weekly SLFP news briefing at the party office, Minister De Soyza said all the crooks, thieves and criminals will join the SLPP assuming it as 'a safe heaven' for them.
"But the fate of the party with the flower bud as the party symbol has already been decided, he said.
?At the moment, we have 63 registered political parties in the country. Except for those political parties with a representation in Parliament, the entire support base and the membership of all other political parties can be accommodated in a three wheeler and the SLPP is no exception,? he said.
Minister?De Soyza said more respected, popular and experienced politicians than 'GL or Basil' like Gamini Dissanayaka, Lalith Athulathmudali and Maithripala Senanayake had attempted to break the UNP or the SLFP in the past and come to power forming new political parties but they were miserably failed.(Sandun Jayasekara)
