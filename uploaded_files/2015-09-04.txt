Supermarket food court stall managers watch out!
	
Raids will be carried out at supermarket complexes in the city by the Colombo Municipality Public Health Department due to the increase in complaints of the standard of food and beverages sold at the food courts of the shopping complexes.
When conducting several health related programmes, health officials discovered houseflies, rats and roaches in food courts in supermarket complexes in Bamabalapitiya, Kollupitiya and Narahenpita.
CMC Chief Health Officer (CMO) Dr. Ruwan Wijeyamuni said that although cooking was not permitted in ground floor stalls, it was a law that was often violated that led to poor hygiene.
?Kitchens of these food court stalls are not properly maintained. Ants, houseflies, rats and roaches have been seen by customers on several occasions. We are investigating whether the food and beverage items are also contaminated by such vermin,? he said.
The CMO went on to say they would obtain samples of food and beverages sold from these places.
?We will send them to be tested and if we find them to be contaminated we will take legal action under the Food Act,? Dr. Wijeyamuni said.
He said raids will be conducted by health inspectors at every supermarket complex within the city limits soon.
The public are encouraged to call 0112676161 for complaints and reports of any instances of sub-standard food and beverage items sold at any supermarket complex, stall or restaurant.
He added that complaints will be filed with the Central Food Safety Unit of the CMC and action will be taken thereafter by health officers. (Piyumi Fonseka)

JVP defends appointment of Sampanthan as OL
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), which defended the appointment of TNA Parliamentary Group Leader R. Sampanthan as the Leader of the Opposition (OL), explained that the latter had been appointed in accordance with Parliamentary traditions.
JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said that they had backed Mr. Sampanthan for the post as he was from the party that had the most number of seats among the parties in the opposition.
He said the UPFA cannot claim the opposition leader?s post as it has signed an agreement with the UNP to form a joint government.
He pointed out that there were only six recognized parties represented in Parliament, namely UNF, UPFA, SLMC, TNA, JVP and the EPDP. Therefore, if one of them, in this case the UPFA, had decided to sign an agreement to form a joint government, then it cannot be considered as an opposition party.
As a result the appointment of Mr. Sampanthan as the Opposition Leader was justifiable.
Furthermore, he reasoned that denying the TNA this post could result in dire consequences as the party would have resorted to forming a separate Parliament to resolve their issues.
?One should first consider the repercussions of isolating the TNA before taking rash decisions,? he said. (Yohan Perera)
