Blue outcastes to form a separate political alignment
	
	
	With general elections round the corner, a series of revolutionary changes in the main political parties are taking shape these days. The new leaders of the Blue party have vowed to field under their symbol only impeccably clean candidates at the coming elections and this announcement has created ripples among a powerful section of the party, they say.
A number of politicos blacklisted for their past bad record are to be denied party nomination. Most black sheep about to come under the party guillotine hail from Kelaniya, Kalutara, Ratnapura, Gampaha, Kurunegala, Matale and Rajarata.
Figuring prominently on the black list are once powerful politicos whose names have been linked to large scale corruption, drug and ethanol mafia, acts of thuggary and brazen abuse of political power and authority as seen in instances like subjecting a public official to ridicule and humiliation by tying him to a tree in the presence of the Police. A foul-mouthed woman politician is among those already identified for good riddance as bad rubbish.
Not prepared to be outdone, those to be denied party nomination have already formed a new political alignment which is expected to have the blessings of the deposed Big Boss.

Can't call it 'genocide': Rajitha
	
Terming the resolution an extremist position, Health Minister and Cabinet spokesman Rajitha Senaratne said President Maithripala Sirisena had promised to initiate an internationally approved, domestic inquiry process into alleged war crimes committed by Sri Lankan Army and the LTTE.
This is a period of reconciliation, and both sides should engage constructively, rejecting extremism, he told The Hindu.
Northern Provincial Council (NPC) on Tuesday passed a strongly worded resolution accusing successive governments in Sri Lanka of committing genocide against Tamils.
The 11-page document details different episodes of violence and oppression in Sri Lankan history  from the time of the countrys controversial Sinhala Only Act of 1956  terming them genocidal acts targeting Tamils over the years, culminating in the brutal final phase of the war that, according to U.N. estimates, claimed 40,000 civilian lives.
While the NPC may be justified in raising concern over alleged war crimes, they cannot call it genocide, Mr. Senaratne said. Choosing confrontational ways will hamper forward movement on the issue,
When contacted, the office of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has declined comment.
NPC Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran has said that it should not be considered an epistle only to the international community, but a challenge to the moral integrity and humaneness of the Sinhalese majority, whom he called his 'brothers and sisters.'
In January 2014, when the NPC passed a resolution calling for an international probe into Sri Lankas rights record, it was Mr. Wigneswaran who insisted that the word genocide be dropped, observing it had a very specific meaning legally and hence had to be used with caution.
Northern Province Council member M.K. Shivajilingam of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), who had earlier proposed the resolution, said the Chief Minister had decided to move it after carefully studying various incidents over the years.

Champika to produce blacklist of corrupt VIPs
	
	Power and Energy Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka today vowed to publish a blacklist exposing all the VIPs and higher-ups who have allegedly amassed billions of rupees and dollars of ill-gotten lucre and other assets during the tenure of the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime.
	I have credible information about their bank accounts, the amount of filthy lucre and their sources. I expect to expose all of them with their names shortly, the minister said adding that taking legal action against them would not be a difficult task because the list would contain the necessary hard evidence.
	The minister said those who were unable to control their jealousy and malice against the Maithripala Sirisena Government are now shedding crocodile tears saying they have been threatened and their family members have been warned to leave the country and that no action was being taken by the Government to investigate their complaints.
	They are well aware that they have no future in politics and cannot enter Parliament at the upcoming general election. That is why they are conspiring to bring back former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who was defeated and rejected by the people. They are attempting to fool the voters to win their sympathy and ride to Parliament on Rajapaksas back. These surreptitious attempts will end up as day dreams, the minister said.
	Commenting on the corruption and mismanagement under the Rajapaksa regime at the Lanka Electricity Company Ltd. (LECO), the minister said when institutions of law and justice and law like the judiciary and the Attorney Generals Department work hand in glove with protect corrupt politicians and officials, the prevention of corruption was extremely difficult.
	There was a time in the recent past that reminded us of the pithy Sinhala saying, Naduth Hamuduruwange, Baduth Hamuduruwange which was often carried out at vital government establishments like LECO. Many of those who blatantly exploited major government institutions like LECO, CPC and the CEB by defrauding billions of rupees and dollars have fled the country after the election defeat. Some of them are still here. But we are determined to expose them and take legal action against them wherever they live, he said.
	The corruption at LECO helped accelerate the then President Mahinda Rajapaksas downfall. The fraudulent acts at LECO compelled us to rise against the Rajapaksa regime on behalf of the suffering people who had been denied the benefits of low prices of fuel in the global market. Our only solace during this difficult time is our ability to provide electricity to 95% of the houses in the country without interruption. When I raised my voice against those unfair and corrupt acts I lost my portfolio, the minister said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

China firm 'sure' about Colombo project go-ahead
	
	The Chinese construction company behind the controversial $ 1.34 billion Colombo port city project - currently being reviewed by the new Sri Lankan government - has said it is "sure" about being given the necessary approvals for the ambitious land reclamation initiative.
	In its first comments following the controversy surrounding the project, the China Communications Construction Company said on Wednesday it had "nothing to worry" about the future of the deal, although on Friday the Sri Lankan Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, told Parliament no decision had yet been taken.
	The project would go ahead "for sure", Zhang Baozhong, the company's vice president, told reporters in Quanzhou, in southern Fujian province, speaking on the sidelines of a major Chinese government meeting to push a "Maritime Silk Road" initiative aimed at deepening ties with countries in the region, including Sri Lanka.
	"It is already approved," Zhang said, when asked about questions raised in Colombo about the environmental impact of the reclamation project, which emerged at the centre of attention during Sri Lanka's recent elections with Wickremesinghe pledging to scrap the agreement during campaigning.
	Only on Friday, Wickremesinghe told Parliament that no decision had been taken on approving the project, responding to doubts raised after his own Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne had said last week that Colombo would proceed with the agreement. Senaratne's comments had embarrassed Wickremesinghe, suggesting a rapid u-turn from his campaign statements.
	While Wickremesinghe told Parliament a separate committee would look into the project and its impact, the new Sri Lankan government has, however, also appeared to indicate to the Chinese firm that it does not need to be too concerned about the future of the initiative.
	Zhang, who was invited by the Chinese government to speak at the Maritime Silk Road forum, told the gathering that while there had been "some criticism and doubts" about the project, it was "aligned with development goals in Sri Lanka".
	He rejected suggestions that China's deepening economic ties with Sri Lanka were only a result of Beijing's reportedly close relations with ousted former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. "We had very good relations with [new] President [Maithripala] Sirisena," he said. "There are some people doubting if there would be a negative influence on the project because of political change in Sri Lanka."
	That would not be the case, he said, with the Sri Lankan government declaring that "the project is in line with its development goals and is law-abiding". "They will allow our company to fully promote the project," he said.
	Zhang said the project would extend over 276 hectares, including a 5.2 million square metre building area, and give employment to 83,000 locals. His company would follow strict standards wherever they operated, he said. "We follow our own corporate culture but try to integrate into local society. We focus a lot on environmental protection. For marine projects we have strict standards about maintaining purity of the water body. We have 24-hour sentinel stations. And if there is any influence at all on water quality, we will change our implementation plan." (India Today)

Dodging kith and kin before it is too late!
	
	
	The Compassionate One recently went on a pilgrimage to Kataragama. The religious observance over, he was about to leave for Colombo when he received two separate invitations to lunch.
One host-to-be was a provincial Minister and the other a Cabinet Minister. He attended the lunch hosted by the one who was the first to invite him.
On arrival for lunch, the Compassionate One was surprised to find a large group of his relatives both close and distant waiting to greet him. And the situation was a challenge to a lesson he had learnt through bitter past experience -- the wisdom of keeping relatives at arms length. He also had in his mind that relatives largely contributed towards the undoing of his predecessor as well.
At the lunch table, the Compassionate One calmly helped himself to a slice of fruit and addressed the host with an apologic smile: It is too early for me to have my lunch. Please invite the other guests to go ahead.
He later called at the other Ministers residence where he had his lunch after a brief rest.

Fishermen talks on March 5
	
	The State government on Tuesday proposed to the Centre that the third round of talks between the fishermen of Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka be held held here on March 5.
	The first and second rounds of talks were held at Chennai and Colombo on January 27 and May 12, 2014 respectively following the initiative taken by former Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa.
	Tamil Nadu Fisheries Secretary S Vijayakumar, in his letter to Suchitra Durai, Joint Secretary (SM and IOR), Ministry of External Affairs, requested her to obtain clearance from the Centre at the earliest for conducting the proposed talks here. He also said the list of participants from the Sri Lankan side should be communicated to the Tamil Nadu government after due approval from the Centre. Tamil Nadu Fisheries Minister and Fisheries Secretary, Commissioner of Fisheries and other department officials would be participating as observers in the proposed talks.
	The Fisheries Secretary pointed out that the talks should be held without prejudice and must not in any way compromise the stand already taken by Tamil Nadu government in the writ petition filed before the SC regarding Indias territorial sovereignty over Katchatheevu.
	The delegation of 13 fishermen from Tamil Nadu which took part in the last two rounds would be participating in the third round as well. The Puducherry government too would be requested to send their fishermen nominees and officials for the proposed talks.
	Among other issues, ways and means to speedily and smoothly facilitate the repatriation of Indian fishermen and their boats would be discussed during the talks.
	The agenda include reiterating the traditional fishing rights of TN fishermen to fish in their traditional waters of Palk Bay irrespective of any artificially drawn boundaries with mutual harmony on either side. The commitment made in the previous discussion to thoroughly abjure violent attacks on our fishermen on the high seas by Lankan Navy and to desist from unfriendly acts like abduction, detention, long periods of incarceration of TN fishermen in Lankan jails and stopping confiscation of their boats and fishing equipment by Lankan authorities would also be reiterated during the talks.

From a Ministerial high to a jail- term low
	
	
	This Diyawanna member was once a bigwig in the Green party. Perhaps staking his political career on the royal astrologers prediction, he switched his allegiance to the deposed Big Boss on the eve of the big poll.
He was sworn in as a Cabinet Minister and soon became the star speaker at the new Boss election rallies.
He succeeded causing much damage to the Green party he quit and the campaign of the Compassionate One by publicly charging that the latter had entered into a secret pact with the Green leader which was highly prejudicial to the national interests. At election propaganda rallies held across the country, he held out to the gaze of the people the purported secret agreement claiming it carried the signatures of the two parties to the deal.
When the horse he backed lost the race, the Diyawanna member found himself high and dry. What was worse he had to face prosecution for committing forgery. Highly desperate, the Diyawanna member sent message after message to the Green leader begging him to forgive him and allow him to return to the party fold. He received a belated reply. It said: Give up your national list seat immediately and contest at the upcoming election to re-enter the Diyawanna council.
The reply he received was one that he least expected. The poor man, out on a limb was mulling his next move, when he was hauled before courts and was sent to the Welikada lodge as a guest of the state. However, an assurance given by an erstwhile colleague who visited him the other day has buoyed up his spirits, they say.

Hitapu Loku Sir Tangalle indala katakaranawa (former Big Boss calling from Tangalle). The Blue stalwart waved off the mobile and told his aide to inform the former Big Boss that he was engaged in a discussion with a foreign diplomat and that he would get back to him shortly.
The deposed Big Boss busy planning his comeback to active politics waited several hours in vain for the Blue stalwart to call him and finally in sheer desperation rang up the current Blue Secretary to seek his help for reaching the elusive Blue stalwart. Blue Secretary readily answered the call and was effusive in his welcome when he found the caller was none other than his former Boss. The Blue Secretary also promised to ask the one that leads the opposition to get in touch with him right away.
However, the one who leads the opposition has not called his former Boss and is not likely to call him either, informed sources say.

He gained deputy status soon after being returned to Diyawanna council from the South. Alas! He found himself shorn of all trappings of office when his Boss was deposed recently. Though he lost his status as a deputy, he could not make up his mind to part with the two luxury official vehicles  a BMW and a Range Rover that had been allocated to him.
The new official in charge of Ministry vehicles checking the inventory detected that two vehicles allocated to the Postal Deputy were yet to be returned to the pool. He immediately sent word to the former Deputy that the two vehicles be returned forthwith. Dont forget that this new government is also our government, the former Deputy told the official. The new Big Boss told me I would be soon getting a new position and that I may retain the two vehicles pending that appointment.
The official instantly reacted to this claim with disbelief. After all, this is not good governance. This one is pulling a fast one on me, he thought. He made a formal log entry for Police action to recover the two vehicles. However, the two vehicles are yet to be returned, they say.

	The Colombo District Court issued a permanent injunction preventing the producer and director of the film called Susima from producing, screening and taking any further steps whatever in connection with the film which purportedly depicts the life story of Sri Lankan sprint champion Susanthika Jayasinghe.
	Judge Pradeep Hettiarachchi made this order sequent to lawsuit filed by plaintiff Susanthika Jayasinghe who won the silver medal at 2000 Sydney Olympics saying the film was an invasion of her privacy.
	The lawsuit filed in 2001, sought a permanent injunction to prevent producer Sarath Namalgama and director Mohamed Niyas from proceeding with the film.
	Susanthika said the chief character around whose life the film is woven called and known as Susima Jayaweera would be clearly identified to be her life story and the characters identified as the chief personalities around her life.
	She said at no time did she give her consent to the defendants to produce and direct this film. Susanthika said she objected to any actress portraying her and said such an act would be degrading, humiliating and injuring her causing her pain of mind and grave and irreparable damage and in addition would be an invasion of her privacy.
	Susanthika said she was keen to write her autobiography and to sell it for profit. In the circumstances a film of this nature would adversely affect her rights to do so.
	She said she had learnt that the defendants were taking steps to produce the film and to shoot the film and in the circumstances they had no right in law to produce and direct the film and in the circumstances the defendants were wrongdoers in law.
	Susanthika said she was a public figure in Sri Lanka and was a bronze medalist in the Olympics and silver medalist in Athens.

India not for International war crimes probe against SL
	
Any attempt to challenge the new government in Colombo with an international genocide probe could complicate matters, sources in New Delhi say.
The Indian government has took note of the resolution by the Sri Lankan Northern Provincial Council internally, but officials said it was too early to gauge its importance to the reconciliation process already initiated by President Maithripala Sirisenas new government.
Officials are studying if the genocide resolution would affect the Geneva conference of the UNHRC, where the U.N. special rapporteur is due to submit a report on a U.S.-sponsored war crimes investigations that could also lead to a resolution against Sri Lanka being tabled. India would be keen to see any such resolution put off, it is understood, so as to allow the new Sri Lankan government time to implement its promises to the Northern provinces.
Any attempt to challenge the new government in Colombo with an international genocide investigation at this point could complicate matters, sources in New Delhi have said.
The U.N. special rapporteur is expected to submit a report on a U.S.-sponsored war crimes investigations and a resolution on Sri Lankas genocide against Tamils could also be tabled then. India has traditionally opposed any international investigation into war crimes in Sri Lanka, a position that led to India abstaining from the U.S.-backed resolution at the UNHRC in March 2014.
Sources told The Hindu that the issue of reconciliation and rehabilitation for the Tamil-dominated areas will be a key issue when President Sirisena meets with Prime Minister Narendra Modi next week. The government will be keen to discuss the new governments plans as well as the just-started talks on repatriation of 1 lakh Sri Lankan refugees living in India.
In Delhi last month, Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera, who met with Mr. Modi and External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, said that the Sirisena government would implement a credible domestic mechanism for reconciliation, but wouldnt allow any international inquiry into allegations of human rights violations during the war against the LTTE.
President Sirisena will visit India from February 15 to 18, his first international engagement since he was sworn in.

SLs duty on war crimes: NYT Editorial
	
	It was just one month ago that Sri Lanka surprised the world by electing opposition candidate Maithripala Sirisena as president, rejecting the authoritarianism, corruption and dynastic politics of the administration of the incumbent, Mahinda Rajapaksa.
	President Sirisena has moved swiftly to usher in a new chapter of hope for Sri Lanka, the New York Times said in its editorial.
	So as not to reopen old wounds too soon, his government is now seeking a delay in the release of a report that is scheduled to be presented next month on a United Nations inquiry into war crimes and other human rights abuses committed during Sri Lankas civil war that ended in 2009.
	The government is also lobbying for support from the United States and the United Nations for a proposed domestic tribunal on abuses. The United Nations says as many as 40,000 Tamil civilians may have been killed during the last months of the war. Mr. Rajapaksa had flatly refused to cooperate with the United Nations inquiry.
	Mr. Sirisenas government has taken other positive steps to begin the healing process. It has pledged to free hundreds of detained ethnic Tamils and to restore to Tamil owners land seized by the military for commercial development projects. It has also appointed a new civilian governor for the ethnic Tamil-populated Northern Province and lifted a travel ban on foreigners to the area.
	Mr. Rajapaksa and his brother Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who, as defense secretary, oversaw some of the worst abuses during the civil war, are still national political forces. One of the new governments concerns is the outcome of upcoming parliamentary elections.
	However, noble its motives, the Sirisena government must deal with the legacy of the past. Any delay in the release of the United Nations report must be brief. And the United Nations must remain involved. This is not a rebuke to Mr. Sirisenas welcome intentions. It is simply the best way to guarantee that the inquiry is swift and independent, that witnesses are adequately protected and that perpetrators are finally punished. (New York Times)
