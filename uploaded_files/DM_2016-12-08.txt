Establishment blues vs. Central Banks independence
	
Strongly denying the allegation that the Central Bank is politicized, Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy last week told reporters in Colombo that it is not his institution but what is politicized is the countrys whole economic decision-making system.
According to Dr. Coomaraswamy, this is the perennial challenge that he encounters in carrying out his role as the governor of the Central Bank.
Hence, he called for a proper balance between economics and politics to employ prudent macroeconomic management as the country is now exposed to global capital markets and credit rating agencies more than ever, who could treat Sri Lanka brutally if the economy is badly handled.
In response to the recent allegations levelled at his institution, Dr. Coomaraswamy stressed he does not see any politicization in the Central Bank as claimed but pledged that he would make an attempt to depoliticize the economic decision-making system plagued by undue political interferences for over 70 years by successive administrations. 
We need to depoliticize economic decision-making more. In fact, I have seen some commentary that the Central Bank is politicized. I dont see that. You know I have been here for four or five months and the Monetary Law Act (MLA) is fairly clear in terms of the responsibilities of the Monetary Board and Central Bank, he said. 
The Central Bank recently came under fire by the countrys vocal Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake, who repeatedly accused the monetary authority for being politicized while attempting to encroach upon the affairs of the Monetary Board of the Central Bank, risking the independence of the institution. 
The budget for 2017 presented by Karunanayake last month in fact contained several proposals that could undermine the authority of the Central Bank.
The budget proposed to increase the capital levels of the banks and primary dealers while directing the banks to provide loans to areas of the economy the government deemed important. These clearly fall under the Central Banks purview as the banking sector regulator.
It also proposed to set up a new payment and settlement system bypassing the Central Bank, which is responsible for any transaction involving the countrys financial system by law. In a more recent development, the government was reported to have dictated foreign exchange management to the Central Bank as the governor was reportedly questioned by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the finance minister over his failure to control the weakening of the rupee against the dollar, which fell to Rs.150 a dollar last week. Further, during the monthly economic affairs committee meeting held in the parliament complex last week, both Wickremesinghe and Karunanayake were reported to have charged the Central Bank staff for failing to implement the government policy decisions. 
The Central Bank, according to the MLA, is not set up to carry out the governments policy agenda but to function independent of any interferences and to give advice to the government if and when required on the economic policy. But the finance minister appears to think that the Central Bank should only be monitoring the monitoring policy measures that the government wants to implement but not to advise on how to run an economy.
In response to this criticism, Dr. Coomaraswamy defended his staff for discharging a highly professional job at the Central Bank as required by the MLA.
The members of the Monetary Board and Central Bank staff have been very professional. They work with great technical expertise to carry out the functions that have been given to the Central Bank in the MLA.
So, I dont see any politicization in the Central Bank.
For me, really the challenge is to break the habit of the last 60  70 years, which is the highly politicized economic decision-making in this country. That is really the challenge, to change the balance between politics and economics, he remarked. Now, with these developments, many fear that the Central Banks independence is threatened as never before but it is ironical that the very people who came to power promising an independent Central Bank have conveniently forgotten their pledges and going in the reverse direction. Dr. Coomaraswamy, a respected economist, took up the top job in July this year at the request of President Maithripala Sirisena. In his inaugural speech as the governor of the Central Bank he said it was their job to convince politicians that good economics is good politics.
He however acknowledged that politics cannot be taken out of economics completely.
If its worthwhile for me to be here, I need to try to make that change. The Monetary Board is committed in doing that. I think my colleagues in the Central Bank are committed in doing that. Thats what we like to do, he noted.

Gammanpila to sue Ranjan for defamation
	
MP Udaya Gammanpila said today that he would send a letter of demand to Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake demanding Rs. 500 million as compensation for allegedly making defamatory remarks against him.
Mr. Gammanpila said that he was not admitted to the Prison Hospital during the time he was in remand, as claimed by the deputy minister.
According to Deputy Minister Ramanayake, I had faked to be sick and been admitted to the prison hospital to enjoy privileges. During the 13 days I was in remand, I was never admitted to the prison hospital even for a day. This is another mega lie of Mega Star Ranjan Ramanayake, he told a news conference.
He said he phoned Mr. Ramanayake over the matter and Mr. Ramanayake had replied saying he obtained the said information according to the Right to Information (RTI) Act.
This is another lie. The Speaker placed his signature on the RTI Act on August 4 and it will not be functional till February 4, 2017, Mr. Gammanpila said.
He said the deputy minister had used false information to defame his character by publishing them in a video on the deputy ministers facebook page under the heading The rich can enjoy privileges at the prison hospital
This clearly is a defamation. Therefore, I instructed my lawyers to file a case against Mr. Ramanayake demanding Rs. 500 million as compensation for making defamatory remarks, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

## Title: Is it honesty  or kindness  that is more in thee

Is it honesty  or kindness  that is more in thee
	
Dudley Senanayake, the reluctant politician, entered the political fray at a very young age-he was only twenty five years old. It is believed that his fathers gentle persuasion and constant advice by his friends and other members of his family were finally successful in making him to take the plunge. 
But looking back at his public life from 1936 to his demise in 1973, one begins to wonder whether the intrinsic love and affection he portrayed for his countrymen throughout his public life was the hidden compelling force that persuaded him to enter politics. 
He was born on the 19th June 1911. Incidentally 19th June was the Poson Poya for the year 1911.
He was born in the village of Bo-thale named as the village of the Bo-Sapling, situated in Mirigama in the District of Gampaha (Western Province). 
However, he did not enter the State Council from the area of his birth as that electorate was represented by his illustrious father. He represented the adjoining electorate (Dedigama) situated in the Kegalle District (Sabaragamuwa Province) that became vacant with the demise of a powerful politician Sir Francis Mollamure. 
Having entered the State Council when the country was under colonial rule, he set about his task of opposing the colonial Government in its dictatorial activities. One such issue was incarceration of two of his colleagues, namely Mr. Philip Gunawardane and Dr. N.M. Perera. 
He defended them even though they represented an opposing political party and were severe critics of his political philosophy. They were incarcerated for opposing the war effort during World War II, under the Defence (Miscellaneous No.3) Regulations dated 3rd June 1940. Referring to these regulations Dudley Senanayake stated in the State Council, 
I would like to ask the Hon. Members what is it that the United Nations is fighting for What is the freedom that it talks so much about Do we not see the characteristics of Fascism in this act I would class this as one of the greatest acts of Fascism ever perpetrated in this country. The representatives of the people, with hardly any dissent, have suggested the release of these persons.
Dudley Senanayake stuck to the principle of fairness throughout his life. He was not a blind follower of anybody, not even his father, even though his father was a powerful and a widely respected leader. 
One such instance was in regard to the support extended to the British during World War II. 
As the leader of the House, D.S. Senanayake threw his entire weight behind the British during the War. Even though the British were the colonial rulers of Ceylon (Sri Lanka), D.S. Senanayake felt that in this battle between the Fascists led by Hitler and the free world led by the British, it was the proper thing to do. Moreover, he was of the opinion that such action would surely make the British Government more amenable towards Ceylon (Sri Lanka) in her struggle for independence. 
However, the young Senanayake had other idea: He was of the opinion that the British were an occupying force and that we should not be a party to the war. On a number of occasions, the young State Councillor acting according to conscience found himself on the opposing side of his father and that disturbed him deeply. 
Unable to come to terms with this predicament, he informed his father that he intended to give up his political career. To his surprise, his father advised him not to entertain any such thoughts, but continue to act according to his conscience and that as far as he was concerned he was more than proud to witness his son acting according to his own convictions. 
With the gaining of Independence in 1948, D.S. Senanayake became the first head of Government, and Dudley Senanayake became the Minister of Agriculture and Lands, the Ministry held by his father since 1931. 
The young Minister was given the responsibility to enhance the colossal work done by his father, and many were sceptical, but, within a short period of time, Dudley Senanayake proved to all his critics that he was more than capable of achieving the task entrusted to him. 
His greatest achievement as Minister of Agriculture and Lands was the inauguration of the Gal Oya scheme in 1948. It is pertinent to note that this gigantic scheme was solely financed by Sri Lankas own funds and that not a single cent was obtained from any foreign source. 
Referring to this scheme in Parliament on 21st May 1948, Dudley Senanayake said, 
It is recorded in history that when the tank Parakrama Samudra, or the Sea of Prakrama, was built, it was then the proud boast that the volume of water in all other tanks then existing in Ceylon could not exceed that of the Sea of Parakrama. It can now be claimed that the volume of water in all the tanks of the Island today, including the Parakrama Samudra, will not exceed the volume of water that will be enclosed in this Gal Oya reservoir.
In 1952, with the death of the Prime Minister Rt. Hon. D.S.Senanayake, a crisis emerged in the Government. Even though in 1951 Hon. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, a powerful founder member of the United National Party, who was more or less the second in command, had left the Government and crossed over to the Opposition paving the way for Sir John Kotelawala. 
The Government Parliamentary Group was not amenable to Sir John becoming the successor. Instead, they chose Dudley. Sir John was furious. Dudley Senanayake, however flatly refused to accept saying that it should be offered to the next in line. All negotiations failed as some members of the Government Group threatened to cross over to the Opposition if Sir John became Prime Minister. The very existence of the Government was threatened. The crisis was somewhat resolved by Dudley Senanayake, under tremendous pressure, agreeing to form the Government and Sir John agreeing to serve in Dudleys Cabinet. 
The new Prime Minister insisted that he should be allowed to dissolve Parliament and obtain a fresh mandate and did so just thirteen days after he was sworn in as Prime Minister. Not only did he win this election, he won it quite convincingly by getting for the first time a 2/3s majority in Parliament. 
It was well known that Sir John agreed to serve under Dudley Senanayake because, his mother, whom he loved so dearly, persuaded him to do so. 
However this grudging acceptance did not last long, it finally blew up with publication of an anonymous document called The Prime Ministers Stakes 1952 supposedly authored by Sir John, where he accused Dudley Senanayake of all kinds of villainy. 
Even though this matter was settled amicably, plagued by harassment, conspiracies and illness, in 1953, Dudley Senanayake resigned as Prime Minister and announced his retirement from politics. There are only two instances ever recorded in the long history of ours, of renouncing power by a Head of State; one 
was that of the great King Sirisangabo the other was Dudley Senanayake. Both chose to do so when they were at the peak of their popularity. 
In 1956, one year before the due date, Sir John dissolved Parliament with the hope of returning to power with the majority he inherited from the former Prime Minister. But he was rejected by the people. The UNP was decimated to a mere eight seats and was unable even to claim the post of Leader of the Opposition. 
Shaken by the result, the senior members of the UNP appealed to Dudley Senanayake to come back to lead the party. After much persuasion, Dudley Senanayake agreed to accept the leadership on the firm understanding that Sir John Kotelawala ceased to hold any position in the party and in 1957, Dudley found himself leading the United National Party once again. 
Just three years after assuming the leadership, Dudley Senanayake was successful in making the decimated UNP the largest party in Parliament. However, as he could not muster an overall majority, he was of the opinion that the leader of the next largest party which was led by C.P. de Silva, should be allowed to form the Government. 
He intuitively knew that such a Government would collapse before long and the UNP would return to power with an absolute majority. 
But the majority of members of his party had other ideas and he was compelled to form a minority government. What transpired thereafter forced the UNP to the Opposition. 
The Leftist parties in Parliament formed a coalition with the SLFP that was led by C.P. de Silva and Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike, the widow of late S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike. 
The introduction of Mrs. Bandaranaike into politics to lead this powerful coalition was instrumental in defeating the UNP at the general elections that was held three months later. Dudley Senanayake became the Leader of the Opposition during this period. 
The deputy Prime Minister C.P. de Silva who was always uncomfortable with the presence of Leftist parties in the Government, decided to leave the Government and join the Opposition in 1964, forcing the Government to lose a crucial vote in Parliament. 
At the general elections that followed, the UNP led by Dudley Senanayake with the support of seven Parties received an overall majority. However, since it was C.P. de Silva who was mainly responsible for bringing down the Government, Dudley Senanayake offered him the Prime Ministers post in the new government. 
This offer was turned down but he opted to serve under Dudley Senanayake, and Dudley became the head of Government for the fourth time. 
The new Government that was formed in 1965 was the first Government to run its full term. It was a remarkable achievement considering the fact that it comprised almost all shades of political opinion. 
The UNP led by Dudley Senanayake with the right of centre political philosophy, the breakaway SLFP led by C.P. de Siva with a left of centre philosophy, Marxist Philip Gunawardane, Tamil parties-the Federal Party and Tamil Congress led by Chelvanayakam and G.G. Poonambalam respectively and Rajaratne leading a Sinhala Group. 
It was truly a National Government. The main reason for the government to last its full term was the undeniable faith and respect Dudley Senanayake enjoyed among all those groups. 
Philip Gunawardane who was known as the Father of Marxism in Sri Lanka, was a powerful opponent of the United National Party. However, he joined Dudley Senanayake in opposing the coalition led by Mrs. Bandaranaike. This powerful politician who commanded major support in the sixties was somehow reduced to only one seat in the Parliamentary Elections of 1965. 
Only he returned to Parliament. But as soon as Dudley Senanayake was sworn in as Prime Minister, he called on Philip Gunawardane and requested him to join the government as a personal favour to him. Mr. Gunawardane was overwhelmed and agreed. These two political giants who were once bitter political enemies became inseparable friends. 
The Dudley Senanayake government brought about much needed communal harmony to the country. Communal tensions that arose in 1956 and its reappearance periodically, ceased during the tenure of the new government. His visit as the head of government to Jaffna, which later became the hot bed of communal violence for many decades, witnessed a sea of heads thronging to welcome him and the Prime Minister being carried on the shoulders of the people with the security personnel unable to get near him. It was a fantastic sight that one cannot even imagine happening today. 
Dudley was accused of being partial to the Tamil minority community because he proposed to establish District Councils which were decentralized administrative units, functioning under the control of Government. 
Those who opposed him vehemently then became quite comfortable in participating in Provincial Councils, ad hoc power structures created on the insistence of the Indian Government, which today have become white elephants in our fragile economy. 
The new government was committed to uplift agriculture. Like his father, Dudley believed that the nations well being is linked to food security, and he travelled the length and breadth of Sri Lanka to provide the proper impetus to agriculture. 
However, after the defeat in 1970, his opponents ridiculed him by saying that he was fooled by the officials, but later their own statistics revealed that there was an enormous increase in food production in general and particularly in the production of paddy. 
The Mahaweli diversion was a massive irrigation feat inaugurated during his time. But before its completion his government was defeated at the elections. 
Dudley Senanayake was a simple man. Even as Prime Minister he was often seen driving his own vehicle visiting his friends or attending to private errands, without any security personal accompanying him. 
Many are the instances when his security was instructed not to follow as he was on a private mission. Nevertheless, the Police secretly followed leaving a comfortable distance and was quite satisfied with this arrangement as they were aware of the places he used to visit. One day to their shock he could not be located and a frantic search ensued, only to find the Prime Minister strolling on the beach at Hikkaduwa taking photographs. Photography was his passion. 
Dudley was also a great lover of golf. On one occasion, he instructed the security not to follow him saying that he was going to Nuwara-Eliya to play golf. As usual the Police started following keeping a comfortable distance.
He was driving his own vehicle and at Ramboda Pass the radiator started to boil and the car had to be stopped. The Prime Minister parked the car and sat on a culvert nearby and waited for the vehicle to cool down. The Policemen, unaware of this development arrived at the scene a few minutes later and was shocked to see the Prime Minister seated on a culvert. 
Dudley quietly got up thanked the security for following him and rather embarrassingly asked them take him to Nuwara-Eliya. Such was the simplicity of the man. 
Dudley Senanayake was an avowed believer that public funds should not be utilized for the private use of a public official. 
Throughout his tenure as Prime Minister, he resided at his private residence and insisted that all expenses incurred in his private residence must be financed by his private funds. As Prime Minister, he once travelled to the United States and to the United Kingdom for medical reasons but all expenses incurred by him and that of the doctors, who accompanied him were met from his private funds. Something that is unheard of today. 
The Secretary to the Prime Minister Bradman Weerakoon, who may have had a torrid time differentiating these payments as they are normally met by the Prime Ministers vote, while presenting the Preface for the book Dudley Senanayake The most loved leader of our times, quoted a poem of Gilbert Holland as a fitting epitaph to the life of Dudley. 
It read thus, 
God, give us men!
A time like this demands
Strong minds, great hearts, true faith and ready hands;
Men whom the lust of office does not kill;
Men whom the spoils of office ca not buy;
Men who possess opinions and a will;
Men who have honour; men who will not lie.
An extrovert among friends but an introvert in unfamiliar company, Dudley Senanayake was somewhat a shy personality. He hardly smiled at an unknown person but readily reciprocated. 
On one occasion, his sister-in-law told him that as a politician he should go out of his way and smile with people but Dudley shrugged and said What if they do not recognize me, they will think that I am mad.
This four times Prime Minister, a colossus in the political arena, chose to believe that he may not be recognized. Such was his modesty. 
In 1970, the government was defeated at the general elections. Even though the UNP as a single party secured the highest number of votes in the country, the prevailing electoral system denied the UNP the majority in Parliament. 
Dudley did not wish to accept the post of the Leader of the Opposition. Instead he handed it to J.R. Jayewardene who was then the de facto deputy leader of the party and he remained as only the member for Dedigama. 
Though he wished to retire from politics, tremendous pressure brought about by his supporters denied him that opportunity and he found himself leading the UNP campaign in four by-elections that were held subsequently. The UNP managed to win two out of the three electorates that were represented by the UF Government. 
Almost every day, early morning Dudley Senanayake drove his own vehicle and went to play golf. On one occasion, when he stopped for the traffic lights, three youths in the vicinity started jeering him. He quietly alighted from the vehicle walked up and told them that he lives nearby and that he always takes this same route to go to the golf club and requested them to take the same course of action in six months time if they felt that he deserved it. 
In six months time, Dudley was no more, but the three youths concerned were crying and wailing near Dudleys coffin apologizing for what they had done. 
Dudley Senanayake started his public life as the Member for Dedigama. He became a Minister, Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition, Prime Minister again and again four times and finally to where he started as the Member for Dedigama. When his demise took place in 1973, he was only an MP of the Opposition, yet huge crowds from all over the country flocked to Colombo to pay their last respects to this great man. For miles and miles people queued for long hours to get a glimpse of his body. The London Sunday Telegraph in the front page referring to his funeral carried the headline 4  Million pay homage to Dudley Senanayake. It is interesting to note that this was more than 1/3 of the total population of Sri Lanka at that time. An unknown admirer, who stood in a queue for more than nine hours, walked up to the casket and laid a wreath penned with the question, 
O my leader, please answer me.
Is it honesty or kindness that is more in thee
This perhaps explains more than anything else the love and the admiration people had for him. 
The thirty seven years of his public life were enshrined in integrity that earned him the undying respect of friend and foe alike. Born to an influential family, he moved with kings but was humble enough to be comfortable in the company of a poor villager. Honesty and simplicity are two virtues the people saw in him and admired greatly. Dudley Senanayake will never know how the people of this country reacted to his death, the sadness and the sorrow that engulfed the nation. Those who witnessed it will never live to forget. To those of us who had the privilege of knowing him, his memory, even after forty three years of his demise, continues to bring a tear to our eyes.

Jayalalithaas death a relief to SL: Warnasinghe
	
The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) said yesterday that while they had expressed their condolences over the death of former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa her death was a great relief to Sri Lanka.
JHU national organizer Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe pointed out that the late chief minister was an anti-Sri Lankan leader who harassed Sri Lankans in India and always acted contrary to the interests of our country.
She harassed our Buddhists monks, players, businessmen and those who went on pilgrimage to Tamil Nadu. She also fought to take over the Katchchativu Island and instigate separatism in the in the North and East for her petty political gains.
Mr. Warnasinghe said the defeat of Hillary Clinton was also a happy moment for Sri Lanka as she also had an ulterior motive with regards to Sri Lanka. Secretary Clinton said that an economic embargo should be imposed on Sri Lanka and that war crimes allegedly committed by us should also be investigated fully. Therefore it is a good time that has dawned for the country internationally, he said.
He said he expected that the new Tamil Nadu Chief Minister would adopt a friendlier approach towards Sri Lanka.
He said Prisons Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D. M. Swaminathan should reveal how many Sinhalese people had been resettled in the North and East, how many lands had been released to them and how much had been spent on resettling them.
No steps have been taken to resettle Sinhalese in the north and east. Minister Swaminathan revealed in Parliament that Rs. 80 million had been spent to build Kovils in the north and east. We would like him to reveal how much had been spent to build Buddhist temples there, he said.
He said the Government should reveal its stance on the resolution approved by the Northern Provincial Council, prohibiting the construction of Buddhist temples in the North.
Mr. Warnasinghe said Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe had said that there were no legal provisions for the Provincial Councils to adopt such resolutions and added that if it was so Provincial Councils should be dissolved.
Commenting on Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe apologizing for the UNP burning the Jaffna Library, he said it was an admirable move and added that no Tamil politician had ever appologised for the devastation caused to Buddhist Temples by the Tamils. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Minister calls for probe on Hirunikas allegations
	
Prison Reforms, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D.M. Swaminathan has called for an explanation from the prisons authorities regarding MP Hirunika Premachandras allegations that former MP Duminda Silva, who is on death row had been provided with special facilities.
She alleged in Parliament on Tuesday that some influential prisoners including Mr. Silva were enjoying special privileges, while the poor prisoners were neglected.
"Mr. Silva's medical report says he is suffering from a chronic headache, loss of consciousness, loss of memory and dizziness but all his relatives visited him at the Prisons hospital for his birthday on December 3 and threw a party," Ms. Premachandra said.
Ministry sources said the Minister had asked the Welikada Prison authorities to submit a report after an inquiry into the matter.
The minister said action would be taken against the prison authorities who had allowed such incidents to take place as claimed by her. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

## Title: Red cards set to be introduced in cricket for unruly player conduct

Red cards set to be introduced in cricket for unruly player conduct
	
Cricketers could be 'red-carded' by umpires and ejected from the ground for the duration of a match from next October after the sport's lawmakers on Wednesday recommended on-field sanctions to address declining standards of player behaviour.
The world cricket committee of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), the guardian of the game's laws, has recommended that a player should be removed from the field for threatening an umpire, physical assault or any other act of violence.
Match officials currently report players or incidents to the match referee at the end of the day after which action is taken.
Following a two-day meeting in Mumbai, MCC world cricket committee chairman Mike Brearley said umpires needed to be empowered to impose on-the-spot sanctions, noting that there were more disciplinary problems in the lower-tier leagues.
"There was a survey done of the umpires and 40 percent said they are considering giving up the game or giving up umpiring because of verbal abuse," former England captain Brearley told reporters at the Wankhede Stadium.
"Anecdotal evidence from people who are familiar with leagues in parts of England say that the behaviour has got worse.
"The umpires have to be respected and given the best possible chance and I think cricket is the only game in which there isn't this possibility of an in-match punishment or deterrent."
The committee discussed sanctions like run penalties and sin bins but felt it would be hard to apply them consistently around the world.
"It got to the state where something had to happen to prevent those things happening on the international stage," former Australia captain Ricky Ponting, a member of the committee, said.
"The modern player now understands their role in society, about being role models, and want to play the game the right way for younger kids."
The committee also decided that no changes were required to the current ball-tampering laws despite recent incidents.
The age-old practice of shining the cricket ball has become a grey area for some cricketers who called for clarity after South Africa captain Faf du Plessis was declared guilty of ball-tampering by the International Cricket Council last month.
Television footage appeared to show du Plessis applying saliva to the ball while sucking on a sweet during the Hobart test against Australia leading to him being sanctioned and losing his entire match fee.
The committee also agreed that the game had tilted too far in favour of the batsmen and therefore recommended specific bat size limitations to the edges and depth of a bat.
The new laws will be implemented at all levels of the game from Oct. 1 next year, subject to approval by the MCC's main committee.

Sri Lanka will acquire one offshore naval craft from India next year and another will be acquired by the year 2019, he said.
He added that the Air Force would acquire multi combatant jets.
The State Minister said the intention of the government was to strengthen the armed forces while trying to being about reconciliation between the communities. The government will always give top priority to national security, he said.
