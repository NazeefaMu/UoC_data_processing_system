An Ode to Sybil
	
Sybil Wettasinghe
?
Many a time I commend,
With my daughter the eldest,
Making her a reader, far ahead of avid and voracious,
By your Umbrella Thief, Kuda Hora, I mean.
You the phenomenal literary icon, now a proud NONEGENARIAN!
PRIDE of the nation, fired the young?s imagination.
Modern generation, poignantly lacking,
Their potential is nil, it seems to me.
Who is your MUSE? Is still the wellspring deep?
Sybil the colossus! Doyen of the genre!
Living at your age, the only solace.
When I fly to the land of Kangaroos, on the ninth of December,
I am carrying KUDA HORA, the b?day gift to my Hima,
My e-grandparented, cute son the grand, the pride of the third generation.
Dear respected Sybil let me crown you.
The jewel of the literary giants,
Our soil has ever seen, our children have ever felt, so
??So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
? so long lives this, and gives life to thee.??

Beer tax: Rajitha to demand revisit
	
Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said he would submit a report to the Cabinet tomorrow (28) demanding a revisit to the tax reduction on beer by the budget 2018 as the facts and figures quoted in the budget proposals justifying the tax reduction on beer were factually incorrect.
Minister Senaratne, who is also a Co-Cabinet Spokesman stressed that there was no evidence to prove that beer consumption would reduce the consumption of hard liquor and sale of illicit liquor like kasippu.
He also said that the Colombo University had not done a study on the issue as quoted in the budget speech.
Minister Senaratne said the kasippu consumption according to available statistics was less than 6% among alcohol users in Sri Lanka and not 49% as quoted from the Dunusinghe?s study.
He also added he would demand a withdrawal of the tax reduction on beer from the budget proposals.
In the budget speech, it was stated that 49% of alcohol users in Sri Lanka consume illicit alcohol quoting a research (sic) reportedly carried out by the Colombo University.
But the University says it has not published any report to that effect, as mentioned by the Minister of Finance.
?After the Alcohol and Drug Information Center (ADIC) contacted the author of the referred article Mr. Priyanga Dunusinghe, a lecturer at the Department of Economics, he had admitted that it was his personal research and not a research conducted by the University,? Minister Senaratne added.
?I will try to convince my Cabinet colleagues that it is unwise and illogical to make tax proposals based on incorrect statistics and private studies.
?Besides, the Yahapalana Government and President Maithripala Sirisena are committed to putting an end to the use of tobacco and alcohol in Sri Lanka. That is why this Government, the Health Ministry and President Sirisena get accolades and honours from all over the world for our efforts to control the use of tobacco and alcohol.
?The sharp reduction of tax on beer does not help our objective. I urge the Government, therefore, to withdraw the tax reduction on beer,? he added.
Meanwhile, the ADIC in a statement said that it was pathetic that Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera, a senior Cabinet Member quoting a personal research as a research of the University of Colombo and other Senior Cabinet Ministers repeating the same facts clueless.
?The aforesaid research has not yet been published in any scientific journal, report or presented in any accepted conference. The Finance Minister has justified his arguments on reducing beer prices based on the publication of this study paper in a two Sinhala and English newspapers just before the budget speech on November 9 in Parliament,? the ADIC said.
?The next most important fact is that the research is not conducted using primary data, which is the most suitable approach to finding the prevalence and trends in alcohol use in a country. But this study was done analysing secondary data from Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES), where he has made an assumption of poor, manual labourers and farmers, who use alcohol, drink only kasippu.
?According to the published facts, all low-income households, farmers and labourers in the country use alcohol, assumed to use kasippu, generalising 49% of the population who use alcohol in the country are kasippu users.
?If this is true, 195,965,246 litres (195 mn) of kasippu should be locally produced. (In 2015, annual total production quantities of alcohol companies include- 112, 092, 935 litres of beer, 63,072,311 litres of arrack. This is not practical at all,? it said.
?The most amusing fact is the using the of this particular research in policy reforms, when there are numerous scientifically proved research findings, revealing facts contradicting the facts of this article,? the ADIC said in its statement. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Death knell of government imminent: JO
	
National Organizer of the Joint Opposition Dalles Alahapperuma said it is with disgust that the Joint Opposition rejects the shameless attempt being made by the government to postpone the elections of local government bodies for about 2 years and 7 months. We take this opportunity to sound the death knell of the politics of government.
Issuing a statement, he said, "When delving into the history of postponement of elections, it is the main partner of this government, the United National Party that has become unpopular. That was the action taken by them in 1982 to extend the term of Parliament for 6 years by holding a fraudulent referendum.
It was the UNP that has come to the second place without any contest. That was done by UNP during 1982 development council elections with the support of thugs. In 1996 , the advisor of the SLFP central committee and the partner of the present government, Chandrika Bandaranayke Kumaratunga has made an attempt to gain and infamous ? Black medal? during election rigging in North Western PC election in 1996. That has to be appreciated by us. There are many occasions when the ? UNP election love? can be quoted from the political history in this way. For example 1978 Mahara by election.
It is no secret that all of them are getting ready not to hold local government elections by joining with green and blue colors to commemorate the 3rd year of non-holding elections in Sri Lankan democracy. We named it as ? blue and green? election fraud during the past budget speech.

First ever Moot Court in Sri Lanka
	
H. V.? Perera QC Memorial Moot on International Commercial Arbitration ? April 2018
?
The Victor?s Moot, Sri Lanka?s first ever international Moot Court competition will be organised by the Sri Lanka Law College, accommodating to fill a long-standing vacuum for international exposure to the enthusiastic law student community of Sri Lanka.
?
The International Moot Court competition will be based on the subject area of International Commercial Arbitration and is scheduled to be held on the 05th, 06th, 07th and 08th of April 2018. The competition is titled H. V. Perera QC Memorial Moot Court Competition more commonly referred to as the Victor?s Moot. 
This will be the first ever Moot Court competition hosted and organised by Sri Lanka on an international level.
Moot court is an extracurricular activity at many law schools in which participants take part in simulated court proceedings, usually involving drafting memorials or memoranda and participating in oral argument.
So, as to make sure that a wholesome and fruitful learning experience will be delivered to the budding law enthusiasts, the Moot will be based on a very timely up and coming development of law in the island, which is - International Commercial Arbitration.
Arbitration, much more than Court Litigation, is a significant development in alternative dispute resolution (ADR) today and it will be critical for in-house counsel in commercial entities to be completely aware and be trained in arbitration skills. Thus, it is our vision to make this Moot Court competition a platform for law students to develop these skills which will eventually benefit the wholesome growth of this area of alternative dispute resolution in the island as well. As of now, The Victor?s moot has entered into partnerships and is working closely with the following organizations: International Chamber of Commerce Sri Lanka, SAARC Arbitration Council, Bar Association of Sri Lanka, Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sri Lanka, Ministry of Justice, Sri Lanka, Institute for the Development of Commercial Law and Practice (ICLP), Network for International Law Students (NILS) in organizing this competition.
Furthermore, they are fully backed and are under the guidance of many iconic legal professionals here and abroad such as:
Mr. K. Kanag-Isvaran, PC, Faisz Musthapa, PC, Dr. Asanga Gunawansa (Chairman, Sri Lanka International Arbitration Center/ Arbitrator, Kuala Lumpur Regional Center for International Arbitration), Prof. Srilal Perera - (ICC Arbitrator, MIGA, ICSID), Prof. M. Sornarajah (National University of Singapore), Prof. Austin Pulle (Singapore Management University), Prof. Romesh Weeramantry (Clifford Chance LLP / ICSID World Bank), Prasantha Lal De Alwis, PC (SAARC Arbitrator), Avindra Rodrigo (F J & G De Saram), Thusantha Wijemanne (Emeritus DG of the SAARC Arbitration Council), Anthony Shanil Fernando (General Secretary, International Chamber of Commerce Sri Lanka).
These experts will be in the panel of judges too, in the moot rounds.
The overall vision of the Victor?s Moot, is that it hopes to become a vital gateway to the law student community, to not only tone their skills of arbitration in practice but also of legal research, analysis, writing and oral advocacy. The simulation of a mock court atmosphere while arguing on a hypothetical matter of law, gives them the firsthand experience of functioning under pressure and with the intellectual flexibility required to be successful advocates in the future.
Sri Lanka Law College is the only gateway to enter the legal profession as an Attorney-at-Law in Sri Lanka and is functioning under the Incorporated Council of Legal Education (Under the Incorporated Council of Legal Education Ordinance No. 02 of 1900) to administer legal education to persons who desire to be enrolled in the BASL.
This esteemed institution is committed to fostering the knowledge as well as the skills of law students. Therefore this international mooting arena is organised with the aim of exposing the budding legal minds of the country to global factors and healthy competition, so that their hidden talents may be forged into creating the next generation of legal academics and professionals.

Govt. suffers from ?Gota Phobia?: Gammanpila
	
The Government is suffering from a ?Gota Phobia? and therefore, it is attempting to arrest former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa on false charges of misappropriating public funds, the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) said today.
PHU Leader and MP Udaya Gammanpila said the construction of the D. A. Rajapaksa Memorial and a Museum at Weeraketiya was funded by the D.A Rajapaksa Fund and not by the government.
He said the project was handed over to the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation & Development Corporation (SLLRDC) as it was allowed to carry out private projects.
?The Director Board of the SLLRDC approved the project in February, 2014 with an estimate of Rs.33.9 million. Due to difficulties in finding labour, the SLLRDC paid Rs. 25 million to the navy to carry out the construction of the memorial which was opened on November 2014,? he told a news briefing.
He said no invoice had been sent until the D.A. Rajapaksa Fund had questioned the SLLRDC in early 2015. The Corporation had informed the Fund to pay Rs. 25 million and the Fund had paid the amount on August 31, 2015, he said.
?Later on, the Corporation has sent an invoice asking the Fund to pay Rs.90.8 million. Due to stark increase of this estimation, the Fund raised its objection and paid only Rs. 8.9 million on July 13 this year. The Corporation had probably made a double count error thus coming to a final estimate of Rs.90.8 million. In the final invoice, false expenditure had also been included,? the MP said.
He said the Fund had paid Rs.200,000 in addition to the Corporation today for the construction of the memorial and the museum.
?If someone says Mr.Rajapaksa has misappropriated public funds and therefore, he should be arrested, I invite them for a debate. Mr.Rajapaksa spearheaded the war against the LTTE and made Colombo a livable city. Therefore, attempts are being made to silence him,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Indian police ask interfaith couples: Is it love or terror?
	
?
REUTERS, 26th NOVEMBER, 2017- India?s Supreme Court will begin hearing a case on Monday that prosecutors say shows how Islamic State sympathizers are using ?Love Jihad? ? marrying Hindu women and converting them to Islam ? to win recruits and spread their message.
Over the past 28 months, the National Investigation Agency has picked up dozens of interfaith couples in the southern state of Kerala to question them about their marriages.
The women - all Hindus who married Muslim men ? were asked ?extremely personal? questions during the interrogations, two police officers from the agency said: ?Did you sleep with your husband before getting married? Did he suggest you visit Islamic shrines before marriage? Did he blackmail you before you converted to Islam????
They were looking for cases of ?Love Jihad?, a term publicized by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and other hardline Hindu groups soon after they helped propel Prime Minister Narendra Modi to power in 2014. It refers to what these groups say is an Islamist campaign to convert Hindu women through seduction and marriage.
Police investigations at the time found no evidence of any organized strategy, and the claim was widely ridiculed. But since then, the NIA began focusing on Kerala - a southern state along the Arabian Sea with strong economic links to the Middle East.

New rules over death inquests
	
A twelve-member committee chaired by Prof. Ravindra Fernando, Head, Department of Forensic Medicine of the Colombo University has made far-reaching proposals on the Policy and Legal Framework pertaining to the Law on Inquests into Deaths.
The proposals include a Postmortem Examination shall be mandatory for certain types of deaths such as un-witnessed suicides, deaths of multiple persons in the course of the same transaction or event.
The committee also proposes that deaths suggestive of having occurred while a Police officer, members of the armed forces or any other public servant having allegedly discharged his duties or exercised power conferred on him and any other category of death in respect of which the Minister rules that an inquest is required together with a postmortem examination, Prof. Fernando emphasised.
The Committee appointed in 2014 to study the Policy and Legal Framework pertaining to the proposed Law on Inquests into Deaths will present its final report to Justice and Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala in the next few weeks, he said.
The report will define categories (types) of deaths in respect of which inquests should be held, Prof. Fernando told the Daily Mirror yesterday.
The new proposals will include that inquests must be held for maternal deaths, deaths in psychiatry wards and psychiatry units of hospitals, deaths of Police Officers and Members of the Armed Forces while on duty, deaths of Sri Lankan nationals who have died overseas, deaths in care facilities, deaths in respect of which family members or dependents of the deceased request that an inquest and or a postmortem examination be conducted, and deaths due to alleged negligence, including medical negligence.
The proposed law will make provision for the conduct of four types of inquests. They are Inquests by Inquirers (normal inquests by Inquirers), Magisterial Inquests (normal magisterial Inquests), Magisterial Investigative Inquests and inquests by High Court Judges.
Deaths as a result of mass natural disasters and where on a consideration of the attendant circumstances pertaining to the death of a person, the Attorney General is of the opinion that interest of justice warrant the conduct of a detailed and in-depth Inquest by a senior judicial officer, High Court Judges will be requested to conduct inquests, Prof. Fernando stressed
Powers and functions to be conferred on Inquirers, Magistrates, High Court Judges for the purpose of conducting Inquests will be defined.
The Committee has suggested providing for the commissioning of a foreign Forensic Pathologist to conduct a particular forensic pathological imaging, screening, or any other examination or test when necessary. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Pakistan crackdown on religious protesters,  sets off violent clashes
	
?
Protests erupted across Pakistan on Saturday, compelling the government to call out army troops and paramilitary rangers after nightfall to restore order in cities and towns filled with angry crowds.? ?
The nationwide protests developed after security forces in the capital launched a crackdown on thousands of religious demonstrators. Conflict began when police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at demonstrators camped on a highway interchange outside Islamabad, who fought back with clubs and stones. Hundreds of injuries were reported, with at least two people dead, according to accounts.? ?
The demonstrators called for a federal minister to be fired over a religious controversy, but by midday, many protesters were demanding that entire government step down. By evening, police had retreated and the protesters had regrouped, with more supporters joining them.? ?
The protests began over a proposed change in election laws that weakened an oath that all candidates for public office must repeat, swearing they believe that Muhammad was the final prophet. Pakistan?s population is 95 percent Muslim.? ?
The government swiftly apologized for the ?clerical error,? but the protest leaders continued to push for the firing of the law minister, Zahid Hamid.? ?
The protests were spearheaded by a movement dedicated to defending the honor of Muhammad and the country?s strict laws against religious blasphemy.??

135 - year - journey of the YWCA
	
The Young Women?s Christian Association (YWCA) is a movement working for the empowerment, leadership and rights of women, young women and girls in more than 120 countries and 20,000 communities around the world. It was founded by Mary Jane Kinnaird and Emma Robarts in 1855 in the United Kingdom. The headquarters is located in Geneva, Switzerland.
The Young Women?s Christian Association of Sri Lanka was founded in Sri Lanka in 1882 with the visit of Emily Kinnaird to Ceylon as YWCA of Ceylon.
The YWCA of Ceylon, is affiliated to the YWCA of London which is started in 1884. The first National Conference of YWCA of Sri Lanka was held in September 1951 in Colombo.
The National General Secretary of the YWCA Shamalee Perera told the Daily Mirror that as it celebrated the 135th Anniversary, it had gone through challenges and success at the National level right throughout the beginning.
?Now it has spread widely and engaged in a lot of charitable works giving priority to the rights of women. Local branches are active both in Urban and rural areas,? she said.
?Currently, there are 22 local associations around the country. Providing hostels for women is the key service of the YWCA.? Mrs. Perera said.
She said that The Rotunda which is the National House was open as the YWCA Hostel at National Office and becomes A Home Away from Home to young women who came to Colombo for study or work.
?By Love Serve One Another? is the Motto of the YWCA. As Sri Lanka was embroiled with the negative impact of war and political changes, the YWCA of Sri Lanka focused its programmes and services, especially to work towards rebuilding a sustainable livelihood for women, young women and children.
The YWCA of Sri Lanka also adheres to the Envisioning Goal adopted at the 28thWorld Council of the World YWCA. The Envisioning Goal is ?By 2035, 100 million young women and girls will transform power structures to create justice, gender equality and a world without violence and war; leading a sustainable YWCA movement, inclusive of all women.?
In achieving the goals, the YWCA of Sri Lanka focuses her work on two broad areas such as ?Democracy & Women? and ?Economic & Social Equity?.
?
"By 2035, 100 million young women and girls will transform power structures to create justice, gender equality and a world without violence"

??? Women in leadership are another sub-thematic area under Democracy and Women. The aim of this area is to develop women with skills to advocate and lobby for women?s rights in their communities, gearing women to take up leadership roles in the churches and to ensure intergenerational leadership and mentoring programmes within the Y movement.c).Violence against Women, Young Women and Girl Child
The main focus in this area is to enable women to have access to the rights-based solutions and services pertaining to Violence against women, young women and girl-child. This involved counselling of victims of violence and increasing legal literacy by networking with specialized and like-minded agencies.

Preschools
In the early years, Preschools run by the YWCA began as Child Care Centres. Today YWCA of Sri Lanka runs preschools in Batticaloa, Dandugama, Moratuwa and Bandarawela.
Mother Lanka Child Upliftment Programme (MLCUP)
A past National President, Jeyamanie Brito Babapulle set up the MLCUP, where the needy children in the local associations are supported by Sri Lankans living abroad as well as in Sri Lanka.
In conclusion, it is noteworthy to state that the good work carried out by the YWCA should be commended and we wish all the very best in their endeavours. May the Good Lord bless and guide them to carry out the charitable work for women in the future too.
