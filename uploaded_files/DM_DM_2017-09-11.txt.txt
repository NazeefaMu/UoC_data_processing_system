Aloysius arrives at PCoI for fifth day
	
The owner of the Perpetual Treasuries Ltd, Arjun Aloysius arrived at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) this morning to give a statement with regard to the Central Bank bond scam.

## Title: Aloysius served summons

Aloysius served summons
	
Contesting the application made by Presidents Counsel Gamini Marapana appearing for Arjun Aloysius that he was not prepared to appear before the PCoI and as such it could not compel him to give evidence, ASG Dappula de Livera said today if Aloysius did not appear before the PCoI then it would be a failure.
Mr. Marapana, PC raised a legal objection against his client being summoned to give evidence at the PCoI and said Mr. Aloysius was not willing to give evidence before the PCoI and that the Commission could not compel him to give evidence according to the law.
Referring the Section16 (legal representation of a witness before the Commission) and Section 24 (Summoning witnesses) of the Commission of Inquiry Act, Mr. Marapana PC said the entire proceedings commenced as a result of a bond issue in which Perpetual Treasuries Ltd took part and that Mr. Aloysius was the major shareholder in that Company.
He observed that the Commission can recommend certain legal action after the proceedings and based on that report the Attorney General would file charges at an appropriate criminal court in connection with the matter.
Mr. Marapana PC was of the view that subsequently, Mr. Aloysius would have to be tried in Court.
Mentioning Article 3, 13(3) and 13(5) of the Constitution, He said the Sovereignty of the people constituted fundamental rights in which fair trial and presumed innocent until proven guilty are linked with.
Citing several Supreme Court judgments relating to the importance of acting fairly and under the rule of law he also ascertained that Section 14 of the Commission of Inquiry (CoI) Act also gave immunity to witnesses as well.
Mr. Marapana PC said Mr. Aloysius has the right to avoid self-incrimination during the evidence, which could jeopardize his future right to a fair trial and therefore, Mr. Aloysius could not be compelled to give evidence against himself considering the possibility of hid being an accused in a court of law.
He questioned the way in which Mr. Aloysius personal communications were being taken into custody by the PCoI according to the law.
ASG De Livera contested the legal argument moved by Marapana PC.
Referring to Section 2 of the Commission of Inquiry Act, ASG De Livera highlighted the warrant of the Commission by the President, which is explained in the mandate of the commission.
He said the PCoI was appointed to find the truth behind the bond auction relating to a particular time period. The mandate provided to the it was to discover broadly as to what happened in trading in government securities and not things which were particularly relating to an individual or a company.
ASG De Livera said therefore the Commission could summon anyone to appear before it to find the truth.
He said there was no determination to be concerned about particular individuals or an entity by the PCoI, therefore all the agencies and parties should assist the Commission.
ASG De Livera also contested Mr. Marapanas argument saying that the cited precedents relating to the matter are not applicable since the precedents he cited were in connection with the Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry Act (SPC), but this Commission was operating under the Commission of Inquiry Act (CoI).
He said Mr. Aloysius evidence would enable the PCoI to determine the truth and would assist the commission to do so.
The ASG said the President had appointed the PCoI taking into consideration the national interest as well.
People of this country are keenly awaiting the outcome of the commission, not only about the wrongdoers, but as to who is responsible for this blunder or the robbery, ASG Livera said.
He said Aloysius evidence was significant to the PCoI not only to identify the facts but also to recognize other people who had been involved.
The ASG drew the Commissions attention at this point to the two deleted phone conversations in which Aloysius had referred to a friends in the department.
There is information which can only be provided by Arjun Aloysius, because some facts are within his sole knowledge, therefore the Commission ought to call Aloysius before the Commission, ASG Livera said.
He also observed that the Commission would not serve its purpose, if it fails to get Aloysius testimony before the Commission.
There will be a travesty of justice if Arjun Aloysius is not called here. The whole country is waiting till Aloysius came before the Commission. There are two persons who ought to take this witness stand. They are Arjuna Mahendran and Arjun Aloysius, and there may be others. I wont name them. There may be (he emphasized). So if these two persons dont come, then this Commission will be a failure, the ASG said.
At this point Counsel Chanaka de Silva who was appearing for Arjuna Mahendran extended his discontent over the reference to his client since he had not made any such application so far not to appear before the Commission.
PCoI Chairman Justice Jayawardena then asked whether he was going to do so in the future. Counsel de Silva said he had no instructions so far, amid ripples of laughter in the court room.
ASG Livera replying said that he was referring to persons who ought to testify before the PCoI in terms of the mandate and the evidence led so far.
He said he was also referring Section 14 of the Commission of Inquiry Act which said that such evidence before the Commission could not be used in subsequent place against that person.
The ASG said the Commissions proceedings were regarded as an inquisitorial process and thereby any witness is a competent witness relevant to the inquiry.
However, Mr. Marapana also contested the ASGs argument over what the ASG referred to as an inquisitorial process.
ASG de Livera said the communications devises of Aloysius had been taken into custody after receiving proper orders from the Commission.
At this juncture Presidents Counsel Kalinga Indatissa expressed the view that his client, Kasun Palisena (CEO Perpetual Treasuries) cannot be questioned on the call recordings, because it was contradictory to the Commission of inquiry Act.
While he was submitting his stance before the commission that fairness should be considered in the proceedings Commissioner Justice Prasanna Jayawardena noted:
A large number of people are talking utter rubbish about the Bond controversy over the past two years without any particular knowledge. There are pundits who know nothing when they make pronouncements. We also knew nothing when we came here. Now we are in the process of learning facts as opposed to wild rumors about this. We are only interested in facts. So all witnesses have a role to play in assisting the commission to understand the facts, and that is all.
Justice Jayawardena said: Let me also make this clear. This Commission has so far not come to any finding or fact over any wrong doing. We are still in the process of trying to arrive at whether there were wrongdoings.
The Commission also considering both legal applications by Mr. Marapana PC and ASG Livera fixed the order to be given on Wednesday (September 13) morning.
Meanwhile, PCoI Chairman said Arjun Aloysius had been served with summons through a fiscal of the Court yesterday afternoon to appear before the Commission on September 13 (Wednesday) to testify.
At this point, Presidents Counsel Gamini Marapana sought the Commissions indulgence to provide Aloysius sufficient time to invoke the superior court over the matter if the Commissions order on Wednesday was against Aloysius.
However, the Commission seemed reluctant to provide more time to appeal to a superior court over the matter and observed that it could continue the proceedings until an order comes from an appropriate authority.
At this moment, ASG Livera intervened and asked: Is that some sort of a threat to the Commission. In replying, Mr. Marapana PC emphasized that he doesnt want to threaten any of the Judges, and his submission is not a threat but only a consideration of the rights of a citizen in the country because time constraints cannot be observed in providing individuals the access to justice.
The PCoIn said it would consider the matter on Wednesday.
PTL CEO Kasun Palisena will continue testifying today. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
PTL transferred Rs.920 mn in profits to companies in the group: DSG
		
			Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunathileke yesterday revealed that during the disposal process of the bonds pertaining to Perpetual Treasuries Ltd, there were deals found in the documents provided by PTL that it had transacted with other companies in the group resulting in the transfer of profits amounting to more than Rs. 920 million during February 1, 2015 and September 30, 2016.
			This was revealed when PTL CEO Kasun Palisena was cross-examined on its cost of sales documents provided earlier by them to prove its actual capital gains.
			When questioned by DSG Gunathilleke, the witness said the ultimate beneficiary owner of these companies was Arjun Aloysius.
			PTL had engaged in bond transactions resulting in losses to itself with WM Mendis & Company, Perpetual Capital Holdings, Perpetual Asset Management and an individual called A.G. Punchihewa, who was a director of PTL. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Can Suhash bring back the Sax to life
	
Progress of a promising young musician determined to make a name as a saxophonist
Saxophones were once widely used in Sri Lankan music, and many bands were proud to include a saxophonist. But the DJ culture, the passing away of iconic band leaders such as Stanley Pieris and changing musical tastes have all but disappeared this warm, rewarding and soul-wrenching instrument from our music culture (except the rather -esoteric ColomboJazz Scene). 
Therefore, it was heartwarming to see a young saxophonist playing an emotionally charged version of T. M. Jayaratnes song Sithin Ma Noseli, on his alto saxophone, followed by Blue Spanish Eyes made famous by singers such as Marty Robbins, Al Martino, Willie Nelson and Engelbert Humperdinck. 
His technical mastery of this difficult instrument was impressive. Technicalities aside, the tone colour he produced with a series of arpeggios suggested an artist with much potential for the future. 
Suhash Fernando works as a marketing executive for Wijeya Newspapers Ltd. Advertising Department. He commutes daily to work by train from Negombo; this, plus job pressures, leave him with little time for practising now. If he can overcome this problem, this young saxophonist has terrific potential. There were no musicians in Suhash Fernandos family.
But an aunt and uncle played the guitar, and this may have influenced him to study music and join the Western Music School Band at St. Marys College, Negombo. 
He played the Melodica for the junior band, and went on to play the trumpet for the senior band. Suhash recalls warmly Miss Carmen, his music teacher at school, who literally dragged her pupils to music classes. He was taught the saxophone by band master Nimal Kantha. Though he was able to play it quite soon, the band preferred that he continued with the trumpet. 
Suhash continued to improve his saxophone technique under the tutelage of Chandana Amarasinghe, the band master of the Sri Lanka Air Force at the Katunayake base. He bought a very expensive alto saxophone after passing his Advanced Level exams, the instrument which he plays to date. 
Modelling themselves after the popular pop group the Marians, Suhash and several school friends formed a band called the Maryites. After this debut, he joined a band called Deposit from Ja Ela. In addition to the saxophone, Suhash can play rhythm guitar and his singing ability, too, is an asset to any band. 
His technical mastery of this difficult instrument was impressive. Technicalities aside, the tone colour he produced with a series of arpeggios suggested an artist with much potential for the future. 
Suhash has great hopes for the future but, like so many aspiring musicians, lives and works under considerable pressure. Finding the time to practise is the biggest problem so far. 
The music scene continues to evolve, and there is potential for brass instruments including the saxophone once again with quality-conscious bands. It would be interesting to watch the progress of this promising young musician who is determined to make a name for himself as a saxophonist.

District wise token strikes tomorrow : GMOA
	
The GMOA today warned it would launch a district wise one-day token strike from tomorrow on a staggered basis against the recommendations by the Harsha De Silva-headed Presidential Committee on SAITM.
The GMOA states that the recommendations even contradict the government's previous stance on the SAITM.
GMOA Secretary Haritha Aluthge said the committee was expected to submit its recommendations to the President calling for the setting up of an alternative authority undermining the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).
He told a news conference that the GMOA executive committee which convened this morning had decided to launch the district wise one-day token strike starting from tomorrow and if the government failed to provide a reasonable solution, a countrywide joint trade union action would be launched September 21.
Dr. Aluthge said the token strike would be launched today in Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mannar, Mullaitivu, Trincomalee, Polonnaruwa, Batticaloa, Nuwara Eliya and Hambantota districts; in Vavuniya, Matale, Ampara, Badulla, Monaragala and Matara districts on the 13th; in Anuradhapura, Kurunegala, Kandy, Ratnapura and Galle on the 14th and in Puttalam, Gampaha, Kegalle, Colombo and Kalutara on the 15th.
He said the committee was planning to submit recommendations favouring SAITM including legalizing it contradicting the stance taken by the President.
Dr. Aluthge said GMOA would never allow the committee to legalise the SAITM, and that the committee had not even mentioned the issuance of a gazette notice to suspend student admission. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Floridians crowd into shelters  and rush to protect homes as Irma approaches
	

Hurricane Irma began its destructive barrage on Florida on Saturday, with brutal leading winds flattening trees and knocking out power across the southern tip of the state in what residents feared were the opening blows of a historically
devastating storm. 
The hurricane, leaving a wake of at least 25 dead on battered Caribbean islands, roared toward the mainland with thousands of residents still on the move. More than 5 million people across the state were ordered to leave threatened areas, one of the largest emergency evacuations in U.S. history. 
Some were forced to flee more than once as the storms changing path shifted the bulls eye of panic from the east side to the west side of the peninsula. Officials along the Gulf Coast scrambled to open shelters for a stampede of residents newly alarmed when Irma swung her fury their way. 
The storm is here, Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) said at a news conference Saturday. Irmas sprawling size could produce hazards across the breadth of the state, with all of Florida likely to experience damaging winds, rains, flooding and possibly tornadoes. Storm surges are still a danger on the east coast. 
This is a deadly storm, and our state has never seen anything like it, Scott said in one of his repeated appeals for residents to seek shelter.

Govt. used Lalith, Anusha case to cover Bond scam
	
The National Bikkhu Front (NBF) today accused the government in attempting to cover up the Bond Scam by highlighting the incident of the imprisoning of former Presidential Secretary Lalith Weeratunga and former Director General of the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (TRC), Anusha Palpita for three years.
Addressing a press briefing in Colombo, NBF General Secretary Ven. Wakamulle Uditha Thera said though the verdict added a little relief to the general public, there is an attempt to sweep the Treasury Bond scam under the carpet by highlighting the event.
The Thera said the JO is also directing the attention towards a different direction had launched a fund raising already to pay the fine.
If Weeratunga had resigned his portfolio soon after the former president ordered him to conduct wrongdoings. It cannot be justified now seeking the publics mercy and pursue their support to reimburse misappropriating funds, Thera said.
Thera further said that Weeratunga and Palpita were only fined Rs.100 million even though misappropriating was Rs.600 million belonging to the TRC.
Therefore, the Thera raised questions whether the punishment was sufficient as a fine of Rs.100,000 was charged against a motorcyclist for violating a traffic rule recently. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Kim Jong-un celebrates perfect success of nuclear test
	

Seoul, (Hindustan times), 10 Sept. 2017 - North Korean leader Kim Jong-un praised the perfect success of the countrys sixth and largest nuclear test and urged further weapons development, according to state media on Sunday, in the face of a US drive for tough new sanctions. 
Pyongyang held a banquet, concert and performances in a weekend display of pageantry to celebrate the September 3 nuclear test, which the North said was a hydrogen bomb that could be fitted onto a rocket. 
The blast, which came weeks after the country fired off two intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that appeared to bring much of the mainland US into range, prompted global condemnation and calls to ramp up sanctions against the isolated nation. 
But the Norths leader appeared deaf to the international outrage and hailed the perfect success in the test of H-bomb at a dinner to congratulate the scientists and technicians behind the nuclear programme.

Lankan women saved from traffickers
	
Amid a growing trend of Nepali men and women being trafficked via Sri Lanka, two Sri Lankan women have been rescued from the clutches of traffickers who tried to send them to various foreign destinations using Nepal as the transit point.
The Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) of Nepal Police rescued two Sri Lankan women from a hotel in Thamel on August 25. Both of them left for their homes on Thursday.
The CIB, with support from the International Organi-zation for Migration (IoM) and Shakti Samuha, an NGO working against trafficking, rescued the women aged 24 and 33. They had arrived in Nepal on May 21.
The duo was brought to Kathmandu some three months ago by a broker who promised to send them to Canada. They were first taken to Indonesia, said Nepal Police Spokesperson SP Mira Chaudhary.
The CIB had raided Hotel Bishwonath in Tridevi Marga, Thamel and rescued the girls from Kilinochchi district in Sri Lanka.
They were lured by a broker to be sent to Canada using Nepal as the transit point.
Upon their arrival in Kathmandu, the Sri Lankan broker abetted by a Nepali man kept them in the hotel before disappearing. The girls knew that they were duped only after the hotel owner presented them with a bill of Rs300,000 including the cost of their stay of days.
According to Dilip Koirala, legal and training coordinator at Shakti Samuha, the girls said in their statements that the hotel owner had taken away Rs20,000 each, promising them visa extension.
Many women and men are found to have been trafficked to various Gulf countries via Colombo. Traffickers use the route for lax airport security and easy visa processing for Nepali nationals in Sri Lanka. A team from the Home Ministry including Nepal Police officials visited Sri Lanka two years ago to discuss the rise in trafficking via the country.
Nepal is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labour and sex trafficking, stated a recent report of the US Department of States annual Trafficking in Persons.(Kathmandu Post)

Indradeep Nandi (35), the younger son of the deceased, did not inform anyone that his mother had died although his elder brother Indraneel (40) lives in the same neighbourhood. He told the police that his mother was not talking to him for a few days and wasnt eating anything either. He said he used to sleep on the same bed where the body was found. 
I cooked some rice and dal and offered her but she did not eat. She was not talking to me, police quoted Indradeep as saying.

N. Koreas reckless behaviour requires global response: Stoltenberg
	
REUTERS, 10th SEPTEMBER, 2017-North Koreas reckless behavior is a global threat and requires a global response, the head of the NATO military alliance said on Sunday.
NATO has not been directly involved in the crisis, which saw Pyongyang carry out its sixth and most powerful nuclear test a week ago, but has repeatedly called on North Korea to abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
The reckless behavior of North Korea is a global threat and requires a global response and that of course also includes NATO, NATO head Jens Stoltenberg said in an interview with BBC television.
Asked whether an attack on the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam would trigger NATOs Article 5, which requires each member of the alliance to come to the defense of any other, Stoltenberg said: I will not speculate about whether Article 5 will be applied in such a situation.
We are now totally focused on how can we contribute to a peaceful solution of the conflict, he said.
There is no easy way out of this difficult situation, but at the same time we have to ... continue to work for political solution, continue to press also the economic sanctions.
The United States and its allies had been bracing for another long-range missile launch in time for the 69th anniversary of North Koreas founding on Saturday, but no fresh provocations were spotted while the North held numerous events to mark the holiday.

New York regulator fines Pakistans Habib Bank US$225mn for compliance failures
	
REUTERS: The New York State Department of Financial Services last week said Pakistans Habib Bank had agreed to pay US$225 million to settle an enforcement action brought against it for infringing laws designed to combat illicit money transfers.
The DFS said in a legal filing last month it was seeking to fine the bank, Pakistans biggest lender, up to US$630 million for grave compliance failures over anti-money laundering and sanctions rules at its only U.S. branch.
The regulator said the bank, known as HBL, agreed to pay just over a third of that sum as part of a broader settlement in which it will shutter its New York branch, subject to conditions.
These include submitting to a DFS investigation of transactions processed by the branch from October 2013 to the end of September 2014, and from April 2015 through the end of July 2017.
In a statement HBL said it remains committed to strengthening its compliance processes, operations and controls across its 1,700 branches.
Shares of HBL surged 5 percent, to 160.58 rupees per share, amid investor relief that the fine was not larger than US$225 million.
Thursdays announced settlement does not preclude further future enforcement action if the DFS investigation reveals further problems.
The enforcement action followed a 2016 review in which the regulator said it found weaknesses in the banks risk management and compliance that management had failed to tackle.
The review showed HBL had failed to properly screen thousands of transactions and had processed payments for known criminals and sanctioned entities, among other failings.
The bank has repeatedly been given more than sufficient opportunity to correct its glaring deficiencies, yet it has failed to do so, Financial Services Superintendent Maria Vullo said in the statement.
DFS will not stand by and let Habib Bank sneak out of the United States without holding it accountable for putting the integrity of the financial services industry and the safety of our nation at risk. HBL disclosed it was in negotiations with the DFS last month and said the potential fine and closure of its New York branch would have no material impact on its business outside the United States.
HBL is pleased to have this matter behind it and has begun the orderly wind-down of its New York operations, Matthew Biben, a partner at Debevoise & Plimpton LLP and the banks U.S. lawyer, said in a statement. The DFS said a court hearing set for later this month had been canceled as part of the settlement.

Peoples Bank digitalization drive strengthens digital footprint
	
Since its inception 56 years ago, Peoples Bank has supported customers across the country with practical and convenient financial products and services that meet their unique needs and uplift their lives.
The bank has been a long-standing institution that has relentlessly pushed boundaries and driven innovation to evolve services in line with customer expectations.
In 2015, Peoples Bank took a strategic decision to embark on a historic digitalization drive to become the most digitalized bank in Sri Lanka in order to continue offering greater competitiveness to customers, while focusing on aspiring entrepreneurs and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The digitalization process will help the bank keep abreast with the digital transformation taking place in the global financial and banking sector.
Thus, Peoples Bank selected the most advanced technology platform to implement the digitalization process which is easy to upscale anis capable of meeting expansion capacity requirements into the future.
This technology is the first-of-its kind to be introduced to the Sri Lankan market and has given the bank an unprecedented advantage in the banking sector. There is no doubt that most products and services are moving towards digital platforms and Peoples Bank is clearly leading the way.

The bank re-launched its corporate logo to reflect its renewed identity as a customer-centric bank that meets peoples aspirations to be in line with global trends, thereby re emphasizing the ethos the bank stands for such as convenience, reliability and confidence to improve the quality of their daily lives.
Peoples Bank is working towards being the most successful bank in Sri Lanka through the digitization of its services. The bank currently serves over 17.9 million customer account relationships, through 737 branches, and is also connected to a network of over 4,000 ATMs which are linked through the Lanka Pay gateway. Peoples Bank is in the ideal position to take the convenience of digitalized banking services to all citizens of Sri Lanka.
Commenting on the digitalization drive, Peoples Bank Chief Executive Officer/General Manager, N. Vasantha Kumar stated: Peoples Bank is dedicated to serving the nation by providing a comprehensive range of banking solutions and financial services to citizens from all walks of life, across the entire island. Our commitment to customer convenience has inspired Peoples Banks digitalization drive to deliver enhanced services to empower our customers. As the bank with one of the largest customer bases in Sri Lankas banking industry, Peoples Bank is demonstrating its leadership status by launching digitalization initiatives in alignment with the latest global consumer and market trends. We believe this process of digitalization will deliver multiple benefits to the nation.
Since the launch of the process, the bank has been rolling out digital initiatives. The Peoples Bank Voice App, which empowers customers to check their account balance via their mobile phones by a simple voice command, is the first of many apps that the bank is rolling out,m thereby extending convenience to its customers to enable a seamless banking experience on their Android and Windows smartphones.
Another step is green banking with the YES account for youth in the country to embrace green banking. Sustainability remains at the core of the digitalization drive and the Peoples Green Pulse enshrines a comprehensive environment protection policy of the Bank.
Peoples Bank Head of IT Sandalal Edirisinghe stated: Banking on-the-go or mobile banking is one of the key trends worldwide and Sri Lanka too must keep pace. As a bank with the largest customer bases in the nations banking industry, our digitalization efforts can empower a large proportion of the population to become financially aware and empowered by our digital technology backed financial solutions. We are proud to lead the way in the digitalization of Sri Lankas banking sector.
The digitalization process has involved extensive staff training on digital Omni channels and digital marketing. Although digital banking is mainly for the tech-savvy Generation Y and Millennial, the Bank is retaining hybrid branches to educate technology-shy customers on how online banking can benefit them. The bank continues to cater to the customer who still loves to visit the branch and have personal contact with the staff whilst tapping into the aspirations of the new generations.
Ranjith Kodituwakku, Deputy General Manager  Digitalization at Peoples Bank, added: The digitalization project that has been initiated by Peoples Bank spans a quick and easy digital banking experience to account opening, loan origination, mobile banking and internet banking, thereby transforming entire banking operations: our applications, our customer touch-points, the business process flow, the operational flow, simply the entire process that leads to transforming the bank in to the next level. By becoming the Most Digitalized Bank in Sri Lanka, Peoples Bank will have the bandwidth to ensure universal access for all, thereby achieving total financial inclusion. The banks ambitious digitalization drive will empower it to deliver a seamless digital experience to customers and elevate Sri Lankas banking and financial services to an international digital platform.
Taking digital banking to the next level and introducing green banking to youth, Peoples Bank has established Self-Banking Centres equipped with the most modern ATM, CDM and Kiosks. The touch-screen CDM/ATM/Kiosks are accessible 24-hours a day, 365-days-a-year, further enhancing convenience for customers and putting them in control of where, when and how they would like to conduct their banking needs. The CDM even enables utility bill payments by cash apart from facilitating cash deposits and balance enquiry. The ATM, apart from offering standard features, also offers cardless cash withdrawals and cash advances on credit cards, modified to better suit customer needs. Bill payment is facilitated directly through the account by the CDM and the Kiosk, with real-time update facility for customers as well as non customers. Customers even have the facility of creating daily withdrawal limits upon customer requirements. The Self-Banking units are now established at many locations, with the vision to reach 100 Self-Banking Centres across the country by the end of the year.
The first phase of Peoples Banks digitalization drive culminated recently with the opening of the fully-fledged Digital Center by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at York Street, Colombo 1. It is the first fully Digitalized Bank Branch offering a unique banking experience, thus creating history in Sri Lankas banking industry.
The bank further launched the most advanced account opening process at this digital branch simultaneously to allow customers to experience how its digitalization initiatives will streamline and simplify their financial affairs by offering speed and convenience. Initially, customers visiting the Digital Center will have bank staff on hand to assist them to navigate Digital Banking Products on electronic devices provided by the Bank until they feel comfortable to conduct transactions without assistance. The launch of this Digital Center marks a quantum leap for the bank in its dynamic leadership to become the most digitalized bank by the year 2020, to unlock the benefits of digitalization for its customers.

Prez Committee on SAITM: Dr. De Silva rejects allegations
	
The allegations levelled by the GMOA against the Presidential Committee on SAITM were factually incorrect, Committee Head, Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha De Silva said yesterday.
Dr. De Silva said no one could allege the committee of undermining the authority of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) or reducing its power, when the committee was yet to present the final report to the President.
We would submit the report to the President. I invite those who level such allegations not to attempt to prepare horoscopes for a baby, who is not yet born, he told the Daily Mirror.
The Committee is expected to hand over its report to the President this afternoon.
When asked about the allegation that the Committee was attempting to set up one Accreditation Council (AC) undermining the authority of the SLMC, Dr. De Silva said discussions on the AC had been ongoing for the last 14 years and it was not something new.
The claim that there are attempts to reduce SLMC powers is factually incorrect. In fact, the AC will enhance the authority of the SLMC and empower it, he said.
The Deputy Minister said he was positive that that the Committee might come up with an equitable solution acceptable to all stakeholders over the SAITM issue.
He said they have had lengthy and detailed discussions with all stakeholders of the issue including the SLMC, parents of the medical students, who are boycotting lectures and Governments institutions such as the Attorney Generals Department. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Ranjan and activists demand  Welikada Prison CMO be transferred
	
Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake and six other civil society activists today requested the Health Ministry to transfer Acting Chief Medical Officer of Welikada Prison Nirmalie Thenuwara after she transferred former Secretary to the President, Lalith Weeratunga and former Director General of the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission, Anusha Palpita to the Prison hospital.
In a letter to the Secretary of the Ministry, they said the actions of the Acting CMO regarding the transfer of Weerathunga and Palpita soon after the entered prisons to the prison hospital was against procedure and highly problematic.
Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake, Executive Director of CHR, Rajith Keerthi Tennakoon , Human rights lawyer and former IUSF convener Udul Premaratne , former Secretary of Nursing Officers' Association of the Colombo Remand Prison, Mahinda Kodagoda, Secretary of the Committee for Protecting Rights of Prisoners, Attorney at Law, Senaka Perera, Attorney at Law Namal Rajapakshe and journalist Kasun Pussawela are signatories of the letter.
They further state that when an individual, sentenced to rigorous imprisonment, arrives at the prison he or she is given a prisoner ID. Then the prisoner is sent to the medical center of the prison after his or her photograph is taken. However Thenuwara has met the two men before they were even issued a prisoner ID and transferred them to prison hospital.
"Such an incident has not taken place in Sri Lankan history. Because of the significant criticism leveled at this move the two men were not admitted to Prison Hospital but Thenuwara remained in prison hospital till 9 PM. However she reported for duty the following day before working hours and transferred prisoners V 18069 and V 18068 to the prison hospital. This is a gross violation of established procedure," the letter read.
After the Minister of Prison Reforms issued a directive stating that at least three doctors need to certify the health of a person before they are transferred to the prison hospital, Dr. Thenuwara has teamed up with three other Drs. Tirani, Sujeewa and Waruna Jayathilake to manipulate this directive.
"Dr. Thenuwara has received transfer orders to the Colombo National Hospital this year however this order has not been implemented due to the influence of a trade union and the mediation of an official, who is connected to South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM). Given her behaviour and her lack of qualifications to hold such a position, we ask you to transfer Dr. Thenuwara from the Prison Hospital," the statement read.

Revenue surplus by 2020: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka would turn its income-expenditure deficit into a surplus by 2020, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said while speaking at a ceremony held over the weekend in connection with the distribution of financial relief to tea factories which were affected by floods in May this year.
The Government earned criticism for increasing the VAT. However, State revenue has increased as of today despite all these criticism. Income/expenditure deficit in the year 2014 was 1.5 percent. We were able to enhance our income in 2016 and thus reduce the deficit up to .02 percent. We expect to have surplus income by 2020, the Prime Minister said.
He said Sri Lankas debt service grew by 233 percent from 2005 to 2015.
The Prime Minister said a greater percentage of debts during this time were commercial borrowings and the countrys revenue was not sufficient to pay them off.
Total amount which was needed to pay off debts in 2013 was Rs.100 billion. Debt services exceeded the revenue during these years. We therefore formed a national Governemnt to stabilise the economy and put the country on the right track, he said.
We have allocated more funds for education and health. We have also been able to reduced crimes by 30 percent, he also said.
The Prime Minister said diligent handling of the economy had helped the Government to bring some kind of stability to the economy.
He said a total sum of Rs.330 million has been allocated to give relief to 5, 600 tea small holders and 17 factories. This amount he said is allocated in addition to the Rs.22 billion which is set aside for the fertiliser subsidy.
In addition he said international tea development fund had pledged assistance to the tune of Rupees one billion.
The Government is fully aware of the challenges faced by the tea industry. We hope to go for new programs such going into planting of fresh trees, he said in this regard.
Minister of Skills Development Chandima Weerakody said providing or relief in Galle District has been most successful compared to other areas which were affected by floods. This he said is confirmed by the absence of protests by the affected people in the district.
Minister of Home Affairs Vajira Abeywardene stressed the need for a strategy to minimise the damages caused by floods.
He said tea industry cannot afford to face floods and suffer continuously. (Yohan Perera)

Rohingya rebels call one-month Myanmar ceasefire as exodus grows
	

YANGON AFP Sept10, 2017- Rohingya militants, whose August 25 raids in Myanmars Rakhine State sparked an army crackdown that has seen nearly 300,000 of the Muslim minority flee to Bangladesh, on Sunday declared an immediate unilateral one-month ceasefire. Bedraggled and exhausted Rohingya refugees have arrived in huge numbers in Bangladeshs Coxs Bazar area for over two weeks, while tens of thousands more are believed to be on the move inside Rakhine, many in desperate conditions after more than a fortnight without shelter, food and water. 
A further 27,000 ethnic Rakhine Buddhists as well as Hindus have also been displaced by violence that has unfurled across the northern part of the state.  The Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) hereby declares a temporary cessation of offensive military operations, it said in a statement on its Twitter handle @ARSA_Official, adding it was to allow for humanitarian aid to reach the battered region. 
The group urged all humanitarian actors to resume aid delivery to all victims of humanitarian crisis irrespective of ethnic or religious background during the ceasefire periodwhich runs until October 9. 
It called on Myanmar to reciprocate this humanitarian pause in fighting. 
There was no immediate response from Myanmars military.

SLC to rope in Aravinda de Silva
	
Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) is set to rope in former great Aravinda de Silva in an advisory role after a series of humiliating performances by the senior team throughout 2017. De Silva is set to be put in charge of international cricket with all support staff of the senior team reporting to him.
De Silva headed SLC's Cricket Committee, an advisory body comprising several former Test captain, but stepped down from the post in May due to differences of opinion with SLC officials.
"With the Sri Lankan team in total disarray, we need someone with Aravinda's vision to put things back on track. He will be given full control over matters pertaining to international cricket," a senior SLC official told Cricbuzz on Sunday (September 10).
Accordingly, De Silva's first target will be to interview the candidates for the role of head coach, a position that fell vacant after Graham Ford stepped down from the role in June. De Silva had a close rapport with Ford when he was heading the Cricket Committee and wasn't too happy when attempts were made to undermined Ford's role.
"He wasn't very keen when we first approached him as he is heavily involved with his business. But we have convinced him to help us out with the Sri Lankan team in dire straits," the source added.
De Silva also had a successful tenure as Sri Lanka's chairman of selectors from 2010 to 2011 and earned high praise from captain Kumar Sangakkara and coach Trevor Bayliss. Since then, he has been repeatedly offered the job, but has turned it down saying he doesn't have the time to watch matches.
Sri Lankan cricket hit new lows this year with a series of humiliating defeats. During the tour of South Africa in January, they were whitewashed 3-0 in Tests and were blanked 5-0 in ODIs. Then Bangladesh beat them in a Test match for the first time before suffering a maiden series defeat to Zimbabwe in a five match ODI series at home. Earlier this week, India completed an emphatic 9-0 victory across all three formats.
Sri Lanka also face the danger of not qualifying for the 2019 World Cup automatically. They are scheduled to travel to UAE for a bilateral series against Pakistan followed by a tour to India.(Cricbuzz)

WE ARE OUR MINDS NOT OUR BRAINS -THE BUDDHA DISCOVERED
	
To lead the life of a rational human being, the imperative is not the brain, the hardware, but the software of the conscious mind working in good order
This stunning piece of work is the one you should read, to change your life, by freeing yourself from all stresses and strains. It is truly a classic, a real life changer, replete with penetrating insights into the nature of the human mind, our only life-long companion, the proper understanding of which, the author says, is the direct way to change our lives, in the here and now. 
The recent book, We Are Our Brains, by the internationally renowned neuroscientist Professor Dick Swaab, based on his years of experience treating patients with brain damage and diseases of the brain, seems to have provided the stimulus for Hemananda to write We Are Our Minds Not Our Brains, using Buddhist doctrine of karma, to establish the incontrovertible truth that the brain is subordinate to the superior mind, both of which predate birth. 
Like a highly charged, enthusiastic religious preacher, who has found a universal panacea for all our ills, Hemananda, makes a single-minded effort to accomplish this enviable task, utilizing the emptiness, realm of fundamental particles; Buddhist doctrine of karma and quantum field theory. For all living beings and us the quantum reality is simply inescapable, because each one of us began life as a fundamental particle in a human female womb. 
We are ourminds; not our brain-The Buddha Discovered, Pp 372, hard cover. Available for sale at the Buddhist Cultural Centre, Nedimale, Dehiwala,Rs. 950.
While, wholeheartedly, agreeing with Professor Daniel Dennett, the world renowned researcher on consciousness, that the brain is an incomparable organic computer, where the network of neurons is the hardware and the mind the software, the author says, what really happens when listening to a lecture is that the neurons in the brains of those in the audience, download the lecture from the emptiness, just like a computer downloading information from the World Wide Web.
If not for the mind software, running in the brain hardware, the human being will only be a living and breathing lump of flesh. 
Two exceptionally original concepts are introduced to assist the discussions. First, the existence of an observable pyramid of life, the apex of which is occupied by humans, the only supremely evolved species on earth, and the second, that life is impossible if the collapse of the quantum wave function, is not continuously being performed by our conscious minds.
Although the life-giving energy of consciousness manifests a living human body, that body is of little or no use, if it is incapable of operating as an independent unit of a rational human being Therefore, what matters is what a human does, using his or her body driven by the intentions generatedin the mind, energized
by karma 
Also, in a complete departure from received wisdom and prevailing scientific view, the author draws an unprecedented distinction between consciousness and mind, demonstrating that they are mutually exclusive, using simple, but convincing logic. Losing consciousness, with no chance of a speedy resuscitation, death is the definite outcome. A mind not working in good order, however, a human does not die, but ceases to function as an independent unit of a rational human being. These truths are incontrovertible. 
Therefore, to lead the life of a rational human being, the imperative is not the brain, the hardware, but the software of the conscious mind working in good order. If, our survival depends entirely on rational conscious minds, then mind must obviously be infinitely superior to consciousness, from all possible perspectives. 
Neuroscientists hold the view that consciousness and mind are emergent properties of the whole brain activity. While politely refuting this view, the author, argues that the network of neurons in a perishable brain is designed purely to process information relating to both consciousness and mind, and certainly not to manufacture them. This view is supported by the radical idea that consciousness is omnipresent and universal, being an intrinsic property of fundamental particles, common to all living beings, whereas the mind with the ability to think, an evolved faculty, by natural selection, is personal, private and unique to an individual human being. 
No scientist has so far explained what was there before the big bang, but the author says that there was only emptiness, because even after the big bang there is only emptiness, based on the fact that an atom, the building blocks of everything is 99.9 percent empty
The idea that the mind is an evolved faculty is further confirmed by the truth that, of all living beings, only the human mind has the unique ability to think, endowed, in the authors view, exclusively to establish the supremacy of the humans, as the most evolved species on earth. 
The unique ability to think makes us invincible. All living beings have minds, but only the human mind has the ability to think. It is this unique ability that separates us from all other living beings. The mind, though intangible, is our only bona-fide, life-long companion, capable of delivering solutions to our problems, right now and even beyond, proven by what the Buddha achieved, the conclusive end to the unsatisfactory human existence. This he accomplished, only by elevating his mind, to its pristine purity and radiance, by totally extinguishing greed, hatred and delusion and liberating it from being reborn, ever again, in a time-limited physical body. 
Intentions, driven by the mind are converted into actions using the body, voice and limbs. However, when intentions are tainted by pollutants their corresponding actions, by definition, are unwholesome, the primary cause of our unsatisfactory existence. The moment an action is executed, it becomes history, indelibly recorded as a karma deposit, and once recorded, it no longer belongs to the doer, but to the emptiness and as a result, it can never be erased, but can only be recalled at any time in the future.
A human being is only an embodiment of actions. Actions create energy. Energy, no matter how insignificant, does not dissipate without a trace, but recorded as a karma deposit, unique to that individual, in a wave frequency, of the electromagnetic field. It is this frequency that modulates from one birth to the next, to energize the mind of a future embryo, thereby perpetuating a particular mode of thinking. This is the underlying reason why, no two humans are identical. This obvious truth is underpinned by the fact that our individual actions could be identical, but the intentions driving them could be vastly different, thereby creating infinite variety of modes of thinking minds and humans.
Using the law of cause and effect, on which the philosophy of the Buddha is predicated, the author says that, quantum coherently, vibrating neurons in living brains, provide the unique conditions, the cause, for the energy of the omnipresent consciousness, to manifest, the effect and also the conditions necessary to download, upload, process, coordinate and interpret the energy of karma deposits, recorded in a wave frequency. A wave frequency where karma deposits are recorded does not form an integral part of a human body, but remains detached, as the overarching force controlling its entire interface, with the external world. 
The human body possesses the sole monopoly on execution of actions and as the body cannot live in the past or future, actions are always executed in the present moment. Although the mind continuously generates intentions, only the body is able to turn them into reality, by converting intentions into actions. This sole discretion of the body was one of the powerful tools, the Buddha used to convert those intentions that had the potential only to create neutral karma, bringing the rebirth to an end. Neutral karma deposits are created by neutral actions, which are the mandatory functional actions, wholly devoted to the maintenance of the body, only in a reasonable state of health. When a wave frequency has only the energy of neutral karma, it is incapable of energizing future embryos, consequently, rebirth is brought to an end and that frequency re-absorbed into the emptiness. 
Cyclical activity is the primary mode of operation known to emptiness, because it is perpetually recycling the same volume of energy, created by the big bang, as energy can neither be created nor destroyed. 
No scientist has so far explained what was there before the big bang, but the author says that there was only emptiness, because even after the big bang there is only emptiness, based on the fact that an atom, the building blocks of everything is 99.9 percent empty. 
Only cyclical activity guarantees perpetuity. Light, fresh water and electricity are all cyclical operations, so is the karma cycle, keeping us enmeshed in the unsatisfactory cycle of birth, death and rebirth. It is the energy of un-expiated karma that unilaterally determines our gender, where and when to be born, with what type of body, endowed with what particular brand of individual characteristics. 
Karma and rebirth are notoriously difficult concepts, to comprehend at the best of times. However, the author says, that it is incumbent on us, in this digital age, to make an effort, at least, to understand why each human being is different, although manifested by the same human DNA. 
The incredible diversity of human births is the only clue, he says, that we have, to gain an understanding of the operation of karma, leading to the birth of a human being, who in reality is only a series of processes, which the Buddha outlined in his dependent origination. In reality, there is only giving and receiving; no one giving or receiving. 
Although the life-giving energy of consciousness manifests a living human body, that body is of little or no use, if it is incapable of operating as an independent unit of a rational human being. Therefore, what matters is what a human does, using his or her body driven by the intentions generated in the mind, energized by karma. 
A human being is defined by the quality of his/her interface with the fellow beings and the external world. The only way to achieve inner peace and contentment is to purify the mind, using direct knowledge gained through the practice of insight meditation. It is only a mind completely devoid of pollutants that has the potential to access the fundamental nature of reality, to experience the bliss
of Nirvana. 
An extremely important reference is made, though briefly, to dispel the popular misconception that meditation leads to the achievement of altered states of consciousness. It is impossible to alter the unchangeable state of consciousness, because it can have only one state. 
A human being is either conscious and alive, or unconscious and dead. There cannot be anything in between. It is the mind that is flexible e.g. a mind free of greed is serene, free of greed and hatred is serene and tranquil and hence free of all pollutants, greed, hatred and delusion a mind is totally blissful. They are altered mental states, of the many, that could be achieved only through meditation. 
This book is yet another rare combination of Buddhism and science, with groundbreaking ideas, suitable to be read by everybody, and in particular, the modern inquisitive reader, conversant with the mobile phone, created using the quantum theory. Illustrations provided are concise and relevant.

MP Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe has demanded Rs.500 million as compensation from Centre for Human Rights (CHR) Executive Director Keerthi Tennakoon for defaming him by making false statements during a news conference on August 5.
In his letter of demand the MP said Mr. Tennakoon had made a false statement alleging that Mr. Rajapakshe had obstructed the law being enforced by withholding the committee report on the Welikada riots for more than two years.
The MP said the false allegation had been spread among the public via the publicity given by the media had tarnished his image which he had earned as a professional and a politician for several years.
He said the baseless allegations made him to appear responsible for protecting those behind the Welikada riots.
The MP said legal action would be taken if Mr. Tennakoon failed to pay the money demanded within two weeks.
However, when we contacted Mr. Tennakoon, he said he had heard that a LoD had been sent but had not received any such document. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
