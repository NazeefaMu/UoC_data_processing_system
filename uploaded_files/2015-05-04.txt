IOT aiming to double representation in reformed Parliament
	
	The Indian Origin Tamils (IOT), who are 4.16 per cent of the Sri Lankan population of 20.3 million, are aiming to double their representation in a reformed Sri Lankan parliament, Indian Express said today.
	As on date, there are seven IOT MPs in the House of 225 members. The community is aiming to have up to 14 MPs in a parliament of 255 members to be elected under a new electoral system which is currently under discussion.
	IOT leader Mano Ganeshan told?Express?that if justice is to be done to the long neglected community, there should be at least 10 elected IOT MPs. Besides, another four or five should get in through the national or bonus list. ??
	The IOT had lost representation down the years due to various factors. In 1949, when Lanka had just won independence, there were seven IOT MPs in a 95-member parliament.
	But representation was reduced to nil in the 1952 parliament, because only 5,000 of the 780,600 IOT had qualified for Lankan citizenship under the 1949 Citizenship Act.
	The population of the IOT subsequently got reduced because of the Sirima-Shastri and Sirima-Gandhi pacts in the 1960s and 1970s, which envisaged partial repatriation to India. It was only in 1988 that a substantial number of IOT got voting rights and it was only in 2003 that all of them got voting rights. (Indian Express)

Video: People are with us: UNP
	
	The United National Party (UNP) today said its May Day rally was one of the most successful rallies ever in the history and that it had proved the majority of people were with the UNP.
	UNP General Secretary and Minister Kabir Hashim said the number of participants at the UNP rally had exceeded the number of participants took part in all other May Day rallies organised by other political parties and trade unions.
	?We are labelled as a government with the minority seats in Parliament, but it was proved that the majority of the country?s people were with us. That is the power of the UNP. We were able to elect two average citizens- Ranasinghe Premadasa and Maithripala Sirisena as the Presidents of the country,? he told a news conference.
	Commenting on the 20th Amendment to the Constitution, he said the minority parties had different opinions on the electoral reforms and that the next general elections would mostly be held under the present electoral system.
	?We are committed to enact the 20th Amendment and we are optimistic that we will be able to come to an agreement on the reforms within the next ten days. However, because of practical issues implementing the new system, the next election would also most likely be held under the present system,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)WATCH

Royal princess named Charlotte Elizabeth Diana
	
	The name of the Princess of Cambridge has finally been revealed to the world as Charlotte Elizabeth Diana.
The baby's name was announced this afternoon by Kensington Palace, two days after the newborn's birth. ?
The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge decided on a name for their daughter shortly after the birth but wanted to inform the Queen personally before it was publicly released. ?
There is no protocol which says the monarch needs to be consulted about the name of a newborn in the family, and senior royal sources stressed she has no expectation of being informed in person before the princess's name is made public.
However, William, who has grown especially close to his grandmother in recent years, apparently decided to afford her the honour when they met in Sandringham.
Today, the newborn met her great-grandmother, the Queen, when the family left Kensington Palace to embark on a new life in Norfolk, where the monarch is in residence.?
They had introduced the little girl ? the most senior royal princess to be born for 65 years ? to her brother George and to their families yesterday.?
The newborn may herald a new generation in the monarchy, but it is customary for royals to look to their past for name ideas.
The repetition of names in each generation is at least partly an effort to preserve the continuity of one of the world's oldest institutions. (Daily Mail)
