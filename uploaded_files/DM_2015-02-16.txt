India, SL may sign nuclear agreement
	
	India and Sri Lanka will seek to open a new chapter in ties on Monday with a meeting between PM Narendra Modi and Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena who has chosen India for his maiden visit abroad as president. In a likely big takeaway from the visit, India and Sri Lanka will sign a civil nuclear cooperation agreement.
	India, TOI learned, has decided to go ahead with civil nuclear cooperation with Sri Lanka following its own "breakthrough understanding" over the same during US President Barack Obama's recent visit. The two countries in the past have held negotiations for a civil nuclear agreement but these lost steam last year under Sirisena's predecessor Mahinda Rajapaksa.
	With Rajapaksa gone, both India and the US are keen to wean away Sri Lanka from the influence of China.

UNHRC agrees to delay the report
	
	The UN Human Rights Council on Monday agreed to delay the consideration of a long-awaited report into alleged human rights violations during the conflict in Sri Lanka for six months until September 2015, the Council said in a statement.
	UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad Al Hussein on Monday explained his recommendation to the Human Rights Council to delay the report.
	The High Commissioner stressed that the deferral of the report was for one time only, and guaranteed that the report would be published by September. His request for deferral was granted by the Council on Monday afternoon.
	This has been a difficult decision, Zeid said. There are good arguments for sticking to the original timetable, and there are also strong arguments for deferring the reports consideration a bit longer, given the changing context in Sri Lanka, and the possibility that important new information may emerge which will strengthen the report.
	In addition, I have received clear commitments from the new Government of Sri Lanka indicating it is prepared to cooperate with my Office on a whole range of important human rights issues  which the previous Government had absolutely refused to do  and I need to engage with them to ensure those commitments translate into reality.
	The High Commissioner noted that the three distinguished experts,** who were appointed by his predecessor Navi Pillay to advise the investigation, had informed him that, in their unanimous view, a one-off temporary deferral would be the best option to allow space for the new Government to show its willingness to cooperate on human rights issues.
	Taking all this into account, I have therefore decided, on balance, to request more time to allow for a stronger and more comprehensive report, Zeid.
	I am acutely aware that many victims of human rights violations in Sri Lanka, including those who have bravely come forward to provide information to the inquiry team, might see this is as the first step towards shelving, or diluting, a report they have long feared they would never see. I fully understand those fears and deep anxieties, given the history of failed or obstructed domestic human rights inquiries in Sri Lanka, and the importance of this international investigation being carried out by my team at the UN Human Rights Office.
	There should be no misunderstanding, the High Commissioner continued. I give my personal, absolute and unshakable commitment that the report will be published by September. Like my predecessors, I believe that one of the most important duties of the High Commissioner for Human Rights is to act as a strong voice on behalf of victims. I want this report to have the maximum possible impact in ensuring a genuine and credible process of accountability and reconciliation in which the rights of victims to truth, justice and reparations are finally respected.
