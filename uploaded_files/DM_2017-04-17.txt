Elephant shot at after it goes on rampage
	
The Wildlife Conservation Officers opened fire at a she-elephant when it went on rampage after being saved from drowning in an abandoned well at Kombuwaittakulam in Omanthai.
Wildlife Officers said they were compelled to open fire at the elephant to save the people from any possible danger.
They said a tusker, a she elephant and two baby elephants that roamed into the human habitat in search of water had fallen into the abandoned cultivation well, and that the wildlife officers saved and drove them into the jungle. However, the she-elephant had returned charging, compelling the officers to open fire. (Romesh Madusanka)

Even MR wished me and my mother for New Year but not my seniors- Aluwihare
	
Former Opposition Leader of the Matala Muncipal Council Duljith Aluvihare - the brother of UNP stalwarts MPs Ranjith Aluvihare and Wasantha Aluvihare, said he and his mother received greetings for the Sinhala - Tamil New Year from former President Mahinda Rajapaksa , but no leader of his own party contacted him and extended greetings.
He said though he was critical of the UNP as one of its district level leaders, no one in the party asked why he did so. He said the party has launched a disciplinary inquiry against him as he criticized the party at the meeting of electoral organisers held in view of May Day preparations.
"I earnestly request the UNP Working Committee to conduct an inquiry against me for criticizing the party. I am not scared to tell the truth. I criticized the UNP on behalf of its supporters . Matale remained as a UNP stronghold for 70 years. Only the Aluvihares ensured it for the party," he said. (M.W. Somaratna  Matale )

Expect strong winds, heat to continue
	
Fairly strong winds (up to 40-50 kmp/h) could be expected over the island, the Department of Meteorology said in its forecast yesterday.
The atmospheric disturbance that brought some rain to some parts of the country during the last few days had moved further away heading Myanmar.
Mainly fair weather will prevail over most provinces of the island, it said.
However, light showers may occur in the Western, Sabaragamuwa and Central Provinces and in the Galle and Matara Districts, it said.
It also forecast that showers or thundershowers may occur at few places in the Eastern and North-Central Provinces after 2.00 p.m.
There may be temporary localised strong winds during thundershowers. The General public is requested to take adequate precautions to minimise damages caused by lightning, the Meteorological Department warned.
Meanwhile a weather information website AccuWeather.com said that the depression in the Bay of Bengal was strengthening and was heading towards Myanmar.
A strengthening tropical cyclone in the Bay of Bengal is expected to target Myanmar, preventing India from welcoming any relief from the dangerous heat wave, the Accuweather.com reported yesterday.
A tropical depression formed on Saturday evening, local time, across the central Bay of Bengal. At the time the cyclone was located to the west of the Andaman Islands.
Conditions will be conducive enough that the system may strengthen into a cyclonic storm and potentially even a severe cyclonic storm. Despite being nearby to India it will have no direct impact on India, the report said.
By yesterday Sunday, 16 April the Sun was at its zenith at Latitude: 10 14' North, Longitude: 65 57' East. Sri Lankas location is between about 6 N-9N and 79 E  81E. The sun was directly above the island during the last week causing temperatures in the country to rise. Despite passing over the land mass the heat is expected to continue in the week, reports said.

Feel the pain of the poor and immigrants: Pope
	
REUTERS, 16th APRIL, 2017 - Pope Francis, leading the worlds Roman Catholics into Easter, urged them on Saturday not to ignore the plight of immigrants, the poor and other vulnerable people.
In his homily at an Easter Vigil Mass in St. Peters Basilica, Francis recounted the Biblical account of Jesus Christs mother Mary and Mary Magdalene, filled with grief, as they went to visit his tomb following the crucifixion.
Their grief, he said during the solemn ceremony, could be seen in the faces of many women today.
In their faces we can see reflected all those who, walking the streets of our cities, feel the pain of dire poverty, the sorrow born of exploitation and human trafficking, he said.
We can also see the faces of those who are greeted with contempt because they are immigrants, deprived of country, house and family. We see faces whose eyes bespeak loneliness and abandonment, because their hands are creased with wrinkles.

Fire in container ship: Threat to environment: MEPA
	
The Chemical substance container carrying ship 'MSC Daniela", which caught fire on April 4 was still remained a threat to the environment as the fire was not hundred percent doused, Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) General Manager Dr. Turny Pradeep Kumara said.
On April 4, the Maritime Rescue Coordinating Centre (MRCC) Colombo, had received a fire distress call from the local agent of MSC Daniela as the vessel was 120 Nm off Colombo.
The Indian Coast Guard threw its weight behind the Sri Lanka Navy and Air Force to douse the fire onboard container carrier MSC Daniela off the Colombo port. In addition, the Indian Navy had also directed two of their ships INS Darshak and INS Garriel to the location.
Dr. Turny Pradeep Kumara revealed this information at a media briefing held in Matara on Saturday. The fire erupted when it was passing Indian Ocean in the close vicinity of Sri Lanka and it was transporting 11,000 containers across Indian Ocean when this mishap occurred.
During night harmful particles are flown towards land with the inter monsoon wind now prevailing, the General Manager said.
It has been decided during the media briefing to launch an investigation under the Secretary of Mahaweli Development and Environmental Ministry Udaya R. Senevirathna and Chairman of Marine Environment Protection Authority retired Rear Admiral Rohana Perera, he said. (R.G. Jayawardena)

India helped SL fight the war without being asked to: MR
	
India had helped Sri Lanka fight the war against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) even without being asked to, says former Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa in an exclusive interview to www.wionews.com posted on Monday.
They (India) helped us! We didnt have to ask! Because I was fighting your war, Indias war, not my war, actually, Rajapaksa told the Indian interviewer, Padma Rao Sundarji.
The LTTE killed your prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi and so many other people in India and on your soil, not ours. So in that way, it was not only my war, it was an Indian war, it was a humanitarian war. India helped us in every possible way, he asserted.
 We didnt want to publicize it, tell the press too much. And not only China and Pakistan, even the British and the Americans helped us, he added.
Asked to comment further on his earlier claim that the Indian external intelligence agency RAW had engineered his ouster in the January 2015 Presidential election, Rajapaksa said: You know, I dont want to go into the past. Whats done is done. Its a new page now.
In the light of the allegation that it was under Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modis watch that RAW, led by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, had engineered his electoral defeat, Rajapaksa was asked what he thought of Modi.
 I regard myself a friend of your PM Modi. I admire what he has done for your country, India. And his international prestige. I really like the way he has harnessed the support of the Indian Diaspora in a way I couldnt! I admire his patriotism and his drive at modernizing India. Yes we admire him, theres no question.
On Indias view that full implementation of the 13 th. Constitutional amendment is the best way to solve the Tamil-Sinhalese conflict in the country, Rajapaksa said:  I wont say its the best solution. If it were, the problem would have surely been solved by now. We must remember that all communities must get together to give a solution. You cant come up with one solution only to satisfy one section or community. We have to satisfy all.
Asked to comment on the fear that China might colonize Sri Lanka given the financial control it has acquired under his government as well as the present one, Rajapaksa said: China is a valued friend and a partner in development, thats all. There can be no talk of colonization as such.
But he added that there is a significant difference between the approach of his government and that of the incumbent regime to Chinese projects like the Hambantota port.
The Chinese projects were negotiated by our government as per the structures I described. For Hambantota, it was a Supply-Operate-Transfer (SOT) arrangement only for the terminal and the land was leased to them. The port was under our control. But the present government has changed all those policies, Rajapaksa said.
Asked if it would not be better for Sri Lanka to befriend India rather than an Pakistan which breeds Islamic terrorists, Rajapaksa said: We believe in improving relations with all countries in our neighborhood. This I must tell you. Both India and Pakistan have helped us as best as they can, we have traditionally been friends of both. And that friendship has not been mutually exclusive and contradictory, that is, friendship with one has not been at the expense of the other.
We are mindful of the sentiments of our citizens of Islamic faith, he added to the Muslims who are 8% of Sri Lankas population.
Rajapaksa still thinks that there is a lurking danger of an LTTE revival.
Commenting on the arrest of some former cadres of the militant organization, he said: Theyre probably the tip of the iceberg. The problem is much larger.

Influenza Virus: Declare state of emergency - GMOA
	
The rapid spread of the influenza virus necessitates the declaration of a state of emergency but Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne has neglected it, the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) said today.
GMOA Secretary Naveen De Zoysa told a news conference that the minister should consider this step on a priority basis instead of intervening in the SAITM issue.
He said the virus had reached epidemic proportions while the hospitals have run out of medicine.
The minister should concentrate on this matter without occupying himself with other unwanted issues. There is a shortage of Tamiflu medicine to treat patients affected by the Influenza virus, Dr. De Zoysa said.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Nalinda Herath said it was the government's responsibility to supply the necessary medicine to government hospitals.
There is an attempt to register another foreign cigarette company. Without inviting other cigarette manufacturers the minister should import a sufficient stock of medicines to treat patients suffering from the influenza virus, he said.
Meanwhile, Dr. Herath said the GMOA has set up an emergency service at the Colombo National Hospital to treat those affected by the catastrophe at Meethotamulla. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Lanka ups housemaid recruitment fees by about 92%
	
Sri Lankan recruitment offices have turned their back on agreement with their Saudi counterparts by raising housemaid recruitment fees by about 92 percent from US$1,560 to US$3,000, according to chairman of the recruitment committee of the Eastern Province Chamber of Commerce and Industry Hussain Al-Mutairi.
Sri Lankan recruitment offices have stopped travel permits for their manpower and nullified all documents they received from the Kingdom in order to enforce their decision and put pressure on Saudi recruiters, said Mutairi.
He said Sri Lankan recruitment offices went against signed agreements and increased the monthly salary of housemaids from SR1,100 to SR1,300 starting February.
The Sri Lankan offices wanted to force their Saudi counterparts to sign new contracts which are contrary to the rates set by the Ministry of Labor and Social Development, Mutairi said.
Market sources said a number of Saudi recruiters were likely to accept the new rates so as to avoid SR100 in fines for every day of delay in the arrival of housemaids.
They said that some 300 Sri Lankan recruitment offices made an agreement among themselves to reject any housemaid recruitment request from Saudi Arabia for a fee which is less than US$3,000 (saudigazette)

Mayhem Meethotamulla Garbage dump turns a deadly ground
	
The destruction inflicted by the collapse of the garbage dump
Pics by Waruna Wanniarachchi

On the afternoon of April 14, tragedy struck Meethotamulla when most people were in their houses enjoying the holidays and festive bliss of the Sinhala and Tamil New Year. The floor started vibrating and a mound of earth collapsed on them. Some escaped running for their lives. But some were stuck in the rubble and residents claim that despite the pleas of these victims, rescue operation were not underway until 2.00 am the next day. Twenty six people have died so far due to the collapse of a section of the Meethotamullagarbage pile.
The search continues

Victims devastated of a foreseen tragedy: Death toll reaches26
There were seven children among the dead. According to statistics gathered by residents, another 20 (probably) were feared dead and they also claim that as many as 60 people might have been stuck in the rubble. According to the police, seven victims are currently undergoing treatment at the Colombo National Hospital. 
The garbage started sliding at around 1.30 pm on April 14. Until 2.00 am the next day, though there were more than 500 Army and Police personnel, there were no lorries, excavator or any other vehicles to remove the rubble. In the interim, we heard people crying out for help. Others took shovels and tried to save lives. It was only at 2.00 am that people themselves decided to get the excavators from the depot, said Nuwan Bopage, a lawyer and the organizer of the Movement against the Meethotamulla Garbage Dump. However, by that time he said that peoples cries could not be heard. When questioned by the Daily Mirror, V.K.A. Anura, the Commissioner of the Colombo Municipal Council said he was unaware of it and declined to comment further adding that the CMC has done whatever they could since the tragedy struck. The CMC is currently providing food, clothing and other essentials to the affected people and they are financed by the Council. 
Speaking to Daily Mirror, the Commissioner of the CMC added that currently around 79 families were displaced and 263 houses would be removed. He said according to the geologists, that the collapse occurred due to heavy rainfall. 


When asked if the tragedy was not foreseen, he said that the residents had been asked to evacuate from the area. Some had left while some stayed back. We gave them a monthly assistance of Rs.15,000 for six months, so they could rent out an alternative abode, pointing out there is a risk of this nature when there is a heavy rainfall, he said. 
Since 2011, the Movement against the Meethotamulla Garbage Dump has organized more than 15 protests but to no avail. Both the previous and current governments turned the protesters away by using tear gas at us and baton charges. The same police and Army men who suppressed us then are now here to dig out the buried bodies of our children and our people, said Bopage. 
He believes that there has been an alleged deal which bartered their lives for the benefit of politicians. The CMC had allegedly given the Rs.600 million tender at Rs.800 million and shared the Rs. 200 million among themselves and the politicians, he charged. 
Bopage added that in February 2015, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe promised to solve the issue within six months, but no recourse was offered. Meanwhile, the PM has issued a special statement expressing regret over the incident adding that plans and actions to remove the garbage dump were underway though they were not operational. 
Devastated by the unbearable loss of lives and property

Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Harsha de Silva in a social media post said it was ironic that only a few weeks ago, agreements were signed to convert waste to energy projects to finally deal with this perennial issue. No more garbage will be dumped at this site and two temporary sites were identified this morning for which law enforcement officers would provide access to unblock protesters driven by petty political issues, the post read. 
The post further noted that payments had been made for those families under risk of landslides to move out, but some had not done so. They had even been advised to leave as recently as two days ago, it said. But residents said they were never asked to leave the place. 
However, Bopage said that even if they were asked to leave, it was not possible, as the houses built were the result of the endurance of the people and were worth their lives earning. Five generations of people have lived here and they have land ownership deeds. These are not illegal constructions. Its not that we decided to house ourselves near a garbage dump, but it was they who decided to dump garbage near our houses, he said. He asserted that their persistent struggle was never to quit the place but to remove the mountainous pile. However, the National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) has advised to relocate 130 houses situated near the Meethotamulla garbage dump. 
Two years ago also there was a risk of around 300 houses facing collapse. Then they were offered Rs.1,500,000 and the residents left, he pointed out. 


He further said that though 60 organizations submitted reports to solve the issue, authorities did not accept any of those proposals. 
Politicians who turned a blind eye to this issue should resign. No divisional representative wanted to solve this issue. They gained political benefits out of this, and our children have paid the heavy price for this, he stressed. 
If another garbage truck arrives, we will burn down both the lorry and the driver. We warn politicians not to come here to shed crocodile tears, he said.
The bodies of the daughter, son-in law and granddaughter of Keerthi Rathna Perera, the convener of the Movement against the Meethotamulla Garbage Dump who worked tirelessly for this cause, were dug out. His wife has been paralysed below the hip, he added. According to him, devastated residents angered by the garbage collapse have set fire to an earth mover at 5.00 pm, on the day the tragedy took place. 
Dudley Danthanarayana, who has been a resident of Kolonnawa since 1968 said that by 2.00pm houses seemed to be flying. My house, a huge two-storyed house, is now 50 metres away from where it was. We were just about to have our lunch, but had to grab the hands of our children and run for our lives clad in sarongs. My vehicles were also destroyed, he said. 
He said that though he has taken part in discussions with the CMC Commissioner and MP S.M. Marikkar, no solution was offered though he had warned them of an impending tragedy. I asked them for a solution over and over again, but they remained silent, he said adding that they were never asked to leave the area. 


The CMC has given the tender to a private company to dump garbage here which was not merely collected from the 15 zones of Colombo. Four trucks registered with the private company come from Matugama, said a resident, while another added that there were trucks coming from Homagama, Padukka and Peliyagoda. The garbage of the whole of Colombo district is dumped here for money! We hope the Supreme Court will give us a justifiable solution, he added. According to reports, the Meethotamulla garbage dump is 180 feet in height and contains approximately three million tons. 700 to 900 tons of garbage is collected from the Colombo city daily and dumped here. He further stated at the press briefing held in February that a staggering 1,000,000 tons of garbage was collected from all parts of the country and brought to Colombo, which was ultimately dumped at Meethotamulla. 
Hemamali Abeyratne, an activist fighting against the dumping of garbage at Meethotamulla said that their first protest as a movement was in 2011, held near the Meethotamulla depot and lasted for four consecutive days and prevented garbage trucks entering.
But the then rulers used the Army, Police and the STF to chase us away. Our people were beaten and hospitalized. Garbage trucks were parked on the road and we were unable to enter. The government suppressed us by using their power and weapons. Villagers were beaten, scolded, and they even tried to bribe the villagers. Those buried are our children, parents and elders. Who will take responsibility now she lamented. 
When the Daily Mirror visited the area on Saturday, the pathway that led to the garbage dump was flooded. Distressed and angered residents stood on the sides. From close proximity to where the tragedy struck, we were told that the rubble before us had covered a road completely.
The Dahampura road is 40 to 50 feet below the rubble, said Bopage. He added that the area we stood was elevated by 40 feet as a result of the force exerted by the massive slide. Pointing at a house partly destroyed, he said that a child who lived there died of dengue two weeks before. Houses had collapsed completely and trees were uprooted. While we were talking to them, several backhoes were seen removing the soil.


"Currently around 79 families are displaced and 263 houses willbe removed."

Since 2005 people have been visiting us but no relief was offered, said a weeping Kanthi Kannangara, whose house was built on a block of 15 perches of land which has been completely destroyed by the incident. The army and the police were very helpful, she added suppressing her tears. 
Sri Rahula Vidyalaya, situated near the garbage dump is now converted into a centre to obtain information from victims. It is a combined effort of the Army, Navy, Air Force and the CMC. Terrance Vidyalaya provides temporary shelter to those who were displaced and currently there are around 75 families seeking shelter while other have sought shelter from neighbours, friends and relatives. According to the Ministry of Defence website, a contingent of Army troops from the 14th Division of the Security Force Headquarters - West (SFHQ-West), the STF and the Disaster Management Centre are involved in relief operations. Further, an Air Force helicopter was utilized to control a minor fire that broke out after the incident. It was also reported that the Japanese government promised to send a team of experts to provide relief. 
A man who has been living in the area since 1988 said that garbage was dumped in smaller volumes in the area since 1983. When garbage from Colombo was dumped, we protested and then they shifted the place to Bloemendhal, where another conflict took place. Then they started to dump them here once again forcibly. This
was in 1994. 
In a nearby three-wheeler, a woman was weeping while two women were seen offering solace to her. Perhaps she had just understood or seen a loved one dead, or had her house completely destroyed. But the tears she shed were reflective of continuous negligence by successive governments, and the price they ultimately paid and may continue to pay if the authorities do not bring about a permanent solution.

From May 1, garbage disposal will not be permitted on lands coming under the purview of the Urban Development Authority (UDA), Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said today.
He said the garbage collected in the Western Province was dumped on lands coming under the UDA in Meethotamulla and Peliyagoda.
This will result in the respective local authorities being compelled to find other lands for dumping garbage on a daily basis.
"Some people are blaming politicians for the tragedy that ravaged Meethotamulla. This is not something that happened overnight. It is a problem which has been building up over a period of two decades. Every attempt to remove the garbage from this site has been resisted by different elements with political agendas, the minister said.
He said even the attempts made in 1997 to resolve this problem with World Bank assistance was abandoned because of protests. (Kelum Bandara)

North Korean missile blows up on test launch
	
A North Korean missile blew up almost immediately on its test launch on Sunday, the U.S. Pacific Command said, hours before U.S. Vice President Mike Pence was due in South Korea for talks on the Norths increasingly defiant arms programme.
The failed launch from North Koreas east coast, ignoring admonitions from major ally China, came a day after North Korea held a military parade in its capital, marking the birth anniversary of the state founder, in which what appeared to be new long-range ballistic missiles were on display. South Korea said the combined show of force threatened the whole world.
Pence is due in Seoul at the start of a 10-day trip to Asia in what his aides said was a sign of the U.S. commitment to its ally in the face of rising tension.
The U.S. nuclear-powered USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier strike group is also heading to the region.
A U.S. Navy attack on a Syrian airfield this month with Tomahawk missiles raised questions about U.S. President Donald Trumps plans for reclusive North Korea, which has conducted several missile and nuclear tests in defiance of U.N. sanctions, regularly threatening to destroy the South and the United States.
South Korea, which hosts 28,500 U.S. troops, warned of punitive action if the launch led to further provocations such as a nuclear test or a long-range missile launch.
North Korea showing a variety of offensive missiles at yesterdays military parade and daring to fire a ballistic missile today is a show of force that threatens the whole world, South Koreas Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

Update: Ministry says its an insurance payment
	
The Finance Ministry a short while ago clarified that the amount of Rs.100,000 which will be awarded to the family members of those who perished in Meethotamulla mishap was an insurance payment and not compensation.
Issuing a second communiqu, it said the money will be paid as a result of the insurance scheme which was obtained by the Ministry via the National Insurance Trust Fund (NITF). 
Apart from this insurance payment, the Treasury will release funds to the relevant authorities without a delay once a final decision was taken with regard to providing compensation to the Meethotamulla victims, it said.
Accordingly, up to Rs. 2.5 million will be paid as an insurance payment for the properties which were damaged in the mishap. 
Earlier, the ministry announced compensation will be paid to the next of kin for each of those who perished in the Meethotamulla tragedy.
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said in 2016 the Government had introduced an insurance scheme through the National Insurance Trust Fund as a proactive measure for the payment of compensation to victims of natural disasters.
This has made it easier for the government to pay compensation, he said.
The finance ministry said the Treasury had released funds for relief measures such as the provision of cooked food to those affected and assured that the Government would take steps to rebuild damaged houses or to relocate the victims at safer locations.
Meanwhile, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said that housing units at housing complexes in Colombo could be given to the victims whose houses were destroyed.
