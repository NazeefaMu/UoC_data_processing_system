A parasite on peasants
	

There is a low-lying area surrounded by mountain ranges like Dumbara, Dumbanagala and the Knuckles, home to a small peasant population who eke out a living by farming and Kitul tapping.

A khakied one, a buddy of a powerful local politico, who has made it a practice to visit this area on a regular basis is said to have become a parasite on the poor peasants there.
Every peasant who taps Kitul must offer two bottles of the sap to the khakied one every time he visits the village, they say.
Although the authorities at the district and provincial levels have received complaints against the khakied one, they have failed to take any action against him due to the intervention by the local politico, they say.

Abdominal Obesity shouldnt be neglected
	

Have you ever wondered why every other person you see on the street seems to have a problem with a protruding belly they may not be battling obesity, but the odds are that they are battling an ever expanding waistline. According to an article published in the International Journal of Epidimiology South Asians tend to have substantially greater body fat, in particular abdominal fat, than Europeans. This doesnt however mean that its something that you should consider lightly.
Studies suggest that this type of abdominal fat, known as visceral fat or belly fat, is likely to be more dangerous to your health than subcutaneous fat, or the fat just under the skin. 
The National Obesity, Overweight and Abdominal Obesity prevalence studies conducted in 2010 have revealed that 16.8 per cent of adults over 18 years are overweight, while 26.2% were identified with abdominal obesity. The STEPS Noncommunicable Disease Risk Factor Survey carried out in 2015 highlighted 23.9% among 18-69 year olds were overweight while an another 5.9% were battling obesity. The mean waist circumference was measured at 82.3 cm in males and 82.1 cm in females according to the STEP survey, which indicated a significant rise in abdominal obesity.

As these factors point towards a rising public health concern in Sri Lanka, June 2018 has been declared the National Nutrition Month with a special focus on raising community awareness on reducing abdominal obesity. The theme for this year is titled The Right Way to Reduce Abdominal Obesity.

What is abdominal obesity
When a persons energy intake exceeds the energy thats spent over a period of time, obesity is a likely result. In other words, Obesity is generally caused by eating too much and moving too little! For instance if your energy intake- particularly fat and sugars- is high and not burned through sufficient movement or exercise, it would result in deposits of excess energy or fat. This excess fat is mainly deposited around organs of the abdomen (liver, pancreas, intestines and kidneys) which is known as visceral fat and in the subcutaneous tissue beneath the skin which is known as subcutaneous fat. Visceral and subcutaneous fat jointly contribute to
abdominal obesity. 
If you are a regular consumer of a diet comprising a high amount of refined carbohydrates, sugar, saturated fat and trans fat, paired with next to no physical activity, you are a likely victim of abdominal obesity. Bear in mind that convenient dietary options such as fast food and processed foods will only add to your waistline. 
How to measure abdominal obesity
The desired waist circumference for Asian males as prescribed by the World Health Organisation is less than 90 cm or 36 inches. The ideal waist circumference for an Asian woman is less than 80 cm or 32 inches.
When measuring waist circumference make sure that you are measuring the mid point between the last rib and the hip bone (iliac curve) using a stretch-resistant tape. Your feet should stay close together, while your arms rest at yours sides and your body weight is evenly distributed.

The internet is full of people posting about their weight - loss transformation stories and this is with good reason. Once deposited, getting rid of abdominal obesity is extremely difficult and needs great effort and determination to prevent deposits of fat hindering your well-being.
While it is easy to accumulate abdominal fat, losing this fat would require a multi-faceted approach which doesnt stop at a balanced diet, although it is a very important part of the process. 
Nine ways to burn belly fat
1. Cut down daily intake of carbohydrates
Sri Lankans are accustomed to heavy meals based on rice, rice flour or wheat flour which are rich sources of carbohydrates. The portion of rice, or flour based foods should be reduced while refined carbohydrates such as polished rice, bread, string hoppers and noodles should be avoided. Replace your meals with adequate amounts of whole grains, roots and yams which are rich sources of healthier complex carbohydrates. 
2. Avoid Sugar
Most foods and beverages Sri Lankans consume contain added sugar. Sweetened beverages for instance are a popular choice for many local consumers, including soft drinks, flavoured dairy products, tea, coffee and energy drinks. These along with many sweetened foods contain either mono-sacharides -glucose, fructose or disaccharides- sucrose. Opt for naturally occurring sugars such as those found in fruits instead, which are extremely healthy and have plenty of fibre which mitigates the negative effects of fructose. The regular intake of sugar is associated with the accumulation of fat and poses a higher risk of abdominal obesity. 
3. Trans fats and saturated fats arent your friends
Baked goods such as biscuits and crackers, potato chips and crisps, popcorn, deep-fried meat and margarine are some of the most common sources of trans fats. Diets rich in trans fat cause a redistribution of fat tissue into the abdomen and lead to abdominal obesity and higher body weight even when calories are controlled. Hence, trans fats should be limited to less than 1% of the total fat consumption. 
Sources of saturated fat come mainly from animal products such as red meat and whole milk dairy products like butter. Coconut oil used in every Sri Lankan kitchen is a plant based source of saturated fat. Nevertheless coconut oil is high in fatty acids of a Medium Chain Triglycerides (MCTs). These fatty acids have been shown to boost satiety compared to other fats, as well as increase the amount of calories burned. Hence, replace your other cooking fats/oils with coconut oil and consider cooking your foods in coconut oil, but make sure that you dispense and consume
small amounts. 
4. Increase protein in meals
You can add sources of high protein foods such as whole eggs, meat, fish, dried fish, legumes, nuts and dairy products. An increased intake of protein reduces hunger and improves the feeling of fullness and therefore prevents overeating. It also increases the rate of metabolism while effectively controlling the loss of muscle mass which can occur in weight loss in the long run. 
5. Increase consumption of fibre - rich food
The increased intake of food containing fibre has shown to slow down visceral fat accumulation by improving satiety/fullness, suppressing appetite and delaying gastric emptying. Foods that are high in fibre are whole grain bread, brown rice, unpolished grains like oats, kurakkan, corn; vegetables such as kohila, ladies fingers, carrot; and fruits such as woodapple, guava, mango, apple, orange and banana. 
6. Hydration is important
Adults require 1-2 liters (6-8 cups of 200ml volume) of water daily. However, this number varies depending on activity level and age. For instance people with chronic diseases such as heart and kidney disease need to get medical advice on how much water they should drink per day. Develop the good habit of always carrying a bottle of water. 
7. Regular exercise is a must
Regular aerobic exercise is important to reduce abdominal fat. Aerobic exercise like walking, running, swimming or playing a sport for 30-60 minutes on most days of the week contribute to major reductions of abdominal fat and help prevent visceral fat from accumulating. 
8. Get plenty of sleep
The right amount of sleep is key to preventing visceral fat as well. People who averaged 6 to 7 hours a night of sleep have lowest levels of visceral fat. Less than six hours and above 7 hours are known to associate with more visceral fat.
9. Reduce Stress
Stress has a number of implications on your health. If your days are full of stress, cortisol levels in the body will increase. High cortisol levels are often associated with stressful lifestyles and can contribute to the accumulation of abdominal fat. Stress relieving activities such as listening to music, meditation, yoga and deep breathing exercises on a regular basis will help you keep stress levels at bay.

China angry but silent on countermeasures to Trumps  threats
	

China, (Courtesy South China Morning Post), 21 June, 2018 - Chinas commerce ministry on Thursday accused Washington of being protectionist and blackmailing by threatening to impose further tariffs on Chinese products, but the ministry declined to specify how Beijing will respond.
Ministry spokesman Gao Feng said in Beijing that the United States had abused its import tariffs system and had started trade wars in various parts of the world to seriously undermine the world trade order and harm the interests of its trading partners. Washingtons allegation of China stealing its technology is a serious distortion of history and reality and the US was picking China as a scapegoat for its own problems, he said.
Gao was responding to US President Donald Trumps latest threat to hit US$200 billion worth of Chinese imports with 10 per cent tariffs if Beijing retaliates against his previous announcement to target US$50 billion in imports, and to target another US$200 billion worth of Chinese products if Beijing chooses to fight back. If it makes good on its threats, US actions could affect as much as US$450 billion worth of Chinese imports.
However, Gao didnt give details on what specific retaliatory measures the Chinese government will adopt against the fresh threats.
He repeated what the ministry said on Tuesday, that China would take forceful qualitative and quantitative countermeasures.
China has made full preparations ... to defend the interests of the nation and the people, Gao said.

A purohita at state level, handling a subject mainly related to a vital marine resource has got a regiment of youth as his following whenever he goes about in his constituency.

These young cronies are seen accompanying the purohita whenever the latter takes a walk along the beach or visit the villages, they say.
Some of them are heroin addicts with bad track records. And they brazenly engage in their pastime out in the open as the purohita had asked the arms of the law to go easy on his boys.
By the way, a bold cop had arrested a heroin addict defying the purohitas standing orders. And the poor man was penalized by being transferred out to a distant post soon afterwards, they say.

Film distributors unhappy bringing distribution under NFC
	
The film distributors were vehemently against the abrupt decision to take the distribution of local films under the purview of the National Film Corporation (NFC).
Prior to the decision, the distribution of films was handled by five agents, including the National Film Corporation, and four private companies such as EAP Films and Theaters [Pvt] Limited [EAP], Movie Producers and Importers [Pvt] Limited. (MPI), Cinema Entertainment [Pvt] Limited. (CEL) and Rithma Circuit (NFC).
Addressing a news briefing held yesterday in Colombo, renowned film producer Sunil T. Fernando said NFC's decision would further plunge the film industry into danger and added this was a huge blow to the film distributors.
The film distributors are at a massive risk on account of this decision. The NFC did not consult us before they took the decision. We, as people who have passion towards Sri Lanka film industry, are strongly against this decision because the film industry would be destroyed by this stupid decision, Fernando opined.
The NFC is currently at a colossal loss. It owes us in millions. At the same time, there are more than 80 films which are yet to be released. Against such backdrop, how could the NFC take the responsibility to distribute the films awaiting release Fernando asked.
Hence, he said they were ready to negotiate with the NFC and come to an effective decision that would not put the Sri Lanka film industry into danger. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Golden opportunity to find new co-sponsor: HR activist
	
Sri Lanka has the golden opportunity of finding a new co-sponsor and going in for an alternative and interim UN resolution as the US has pulled out from the UNHRC, said Dr. Prathiba Mahanamahewa, former Commissionerof Human Rights Commission.
Commenting on the latest development, Dr. Mahanamahewa said the US-Sri Lanka sponsored 2015 resolution in a nutshell says that Sri Lankan forces committed war crimes and therefore, a hybrid court should be established to investigate charges.
However, the US says the UNHRC is of no use and like a cesspool. The US also accused the council of being biased and not protecting human rights of a country. We can embark on this statement. The UN resolution was adopted with the consent of the co-sponsors. If one party leaves, the other cannot stand alone. The council must now find a sponsor to fill the vacancy. The Sri Lankan President says the country has won over the hearts of the West as well as the East. We have a golden opportunity to fill the vacancy, preferably with an Asian country, and go ahead for an alternative and an interim resolution, he told Daily Mirror.
He said there were a lot of other countries that support Sri Lanka like Pakistan, China,Vietnam,Qatar and other Middle Eastern countries.
"So you can pass a resolution co-sponsored by one of these countries in future with the assurance of how we are going to implement the resolution. For the last few years, we have not done anything to promote human rights. The things we did were not marketed properly. We have to market what we are doing, Dr. Mahanamahewa said.
Meanwhile, he criticized US Ambassador Atul Keshap for his statement that the US would help Sri Lanka fulfil UN commitments.
The Trumps representative at UN made a very serious statement and left from the UNHRC. But US Ambassador is saying something different. He says they are helping Sri Lanka and the resolution is still in force. The ambassador is leaving Sri Lanka. UNHR Commissioner Zeid al-Hussein is also leaving now. We did a lot to please them but they are not concerned, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

The government will soon introduce new legislation -- in the form of an amendment to the Inland revenue Act -- to waive taxes on childrens savings accounts, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera told Parliament yesterday.
The governments policy is to gradually reduce the Value Added Tax (VAT) and concentrate on earning revenue from direct taxes. We will manage the economy while focusing on the peoples needs. The government has to deal with the debt crisis because total debt component to be settled this year is a staggering Rs.1.9 trillion. It will be a Rs.4 trillion in the next financial year, he said.
Responding to remarks made by the opposition that the prices of essential commodities had gone up, the minister said only coconut prices were high at the moment.
It is true that this government increased the prices of fuel recently, but the prices are lower than what they were during the previous regime, he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

## Title: Hairless by hair loss

Hairless by hair loss
	

Everyone dreams of being proud owners to thick, luscious and voluminous hair. However hair loss stands in the way of making that dream a reality. Hair loss isnt merely just fall of hair in excessive amounts. There may be medical complications involved that lead to loss of hair in chunks. When this happens alarm bells should ring in the mind and indicate that its high time to seek medical advice. Dr. Nayani Madarasingha, Consultant Dermatologist, speaks to Health Capsule this week about hair loss, its causes and cure.


When to worry
More than a thousand hairs reside on a healthy scalp. Each hair undergoes a growth cycle. This cycle consists of 3 phases. The first phase is the growth phase where hairs undergo growth and this may extend to a time frame of a few years. This phase varies according to each individual, explained Dr. Madarasingha. This is why the length and volume of hair differ from person to person. 
Secondly, the hair enters the catagen phase. Here the hair ceases its active growth and the connection of the hair fibres to the roots is lost. The final phase is the telogen phase which is the resting phase of the hair. This lasts for 3 months and this phase is common to people. 
After each hair strand completes its life cycle, it will fall off after 3 months of the resting phase. A new hair strand will grow in its place from the hair follicle, she continued. 
According to the Dermatologist, an individual tends to lose 50-100 strands a day which is actually quite normal. So this kind of hair loss is no cause for alarm. However there are cases where hair is shed abnormally and the hair volume starts getting affected by the loss of hair. When this happens it is high time to receive treatment and prevent furtherhair loss. 
Root causes
Excessive hair shedding and hair thinning are the two reasons that take the blame for abnormal loss of hair. 
There are several factors that lead to excessive hair shedding. Firstly, it could occur as an acute phenomenon after a stressful event such as pregnancy, surgery, dengue, etc. At the end of the resting phase, hair strands should shed for the new ones to surface. However this circumstance causes an individual to lose even up to 90% of hair. On a more positive note, the lost hair can be replaced with new ones in another 3 months. 
Drugs prescribed for certain diseases especially those taken to treat cancer affect the growth of hair and leads to an arrest in the growth of the hair strands, causing them to fall off. Other drugs taken for conditions such as cholesterol too lead to excessive shedding. 
Hormonal imbalances and thyroxin deficiency in particular can cause abnormal hair loss. Diet issues, iron and vitamin deficiencies too lead to problems associated with hair loss. Certain medical illnesses may cause excessive hair loss as well, stated Dr. Madarasingha. 
Hair loss due to hair thinning, informally known as the balding process, is mainly hereditary and caused by genetics. This type of hair loss is also referred to as pattern hair loss as hair is lost gradually. This is seen in both males and females. In women, pattern hair loss may not always be caused due to genetics. Hormonal imbalances and complications such acne, polycystic ovarion syndrome can lead to pattern hair loss, she accentuated. 

Diagnosis
If treatment is started early, this progression can be prevented and slowed down. People tend to treat these conditions themselves and think that oil massages, etc will help recover the lost hair. However hair loss has become an issue that requires medical attention as it may be caused due to various medical reasons as mentioned above. Its very important to identify the cause for hair loss suffered by an individual, she advised. 
There are various diagnostic methods available to target the type of cause responsible for hair loss in a person. An analytical examination is the most basic form of diagnosis where a thorough examination is conducted on the patient, also inspecting the patients family history on diseases and hair loss as well. There are special instruments that are used in the diagnosis too. Biopsies may be conducted, but this is a diagnostic method that is very rarely resorted to. Hair loss due to certain hormones and vitamin deficiencies can be identified simply by a blood test, Dr. Madarasingha informed. 

Treatment available
Many methods of treatment for abnormal hair loss are available and they are said to be safe and successful. Treatment is based on the diagnosis of the cause for hair fall. Topical applications on the scalp and oral tablets that should be continued on a long-term basis are common methods of treatment. If a patient suffers from an advanced case of hair loss, the common methods may not prove to be 100% effective. In such cases, the answer would be hair transplants, she said. 
A technique known as PRP ( Platelet Rich Plasma) is currently being used in hair loss treatment where a small amount of the patients own blood is extracted and the platelets in the blood are isolated and then injected to the scalp of the patient. Blood platelets contain a component known as growth factor which will allow hair to grow back. This procedure too is said to be a safe and reliable one with positive results, the Dermatologist assured. 

Not just a female problem!
According to the Dr. Madarasingha, conditions like pattern hair loss is not just restricted to individuals above 40 years of age or older. Sometimes people in their early twenties and even younger are susceptible to these complications. Its often thought that hair loss is a complication that affects females only. However this is not true. Hair loss is impartial to both males and females alike. Females are simply worried about hair loss than males and tend to take action unlike them!

Harming children: Trump with a millstone tied around his neck
	

The United States President Donald Trump has drawn international condemnation for his preposterous and inhuman order to separate children from the families whom his administration describes as illegal immigrants. On Wednesday, the President relented under international pressure and disapproval even from First Lady Melania and daughter Ivanka. The international fury, pleas from family members and even sharp criticism from close allies prompted him to sign an executive order promising to keep families together in migrant detention centres.
The business tycoon turned President said he had been swayed by images of children who have been taken from parents who are being prosecuted for illegal border-crossing.
I did not like the sight of families being separated, he said, but added the administration would continue its zero tolerance policy of illegal migration.
Yet his reverse decree does not offer relief to families already separated by the policy. Thousands of children, including babies are sleeping on concrete slabs in tents. Most of the children in these camps along the Mexican border are clueless as to where their parents are. Secret tapes that have recorded the disturbed childrens cries could even move a stone-hearted monster.
If only Trump could close his eyes and reflect on the issue, he would certainly have realised that migration has been a constant feature in human history. Only a moron will deny that since time immemorial, humans have been migrating from place to place to survive. We all are children of migrants. The out-of-Africa theory suggests that two million years ago, Homo erectus, the archaic humans, began to disperse within Africa  and some 70,000 years ago, Homo sapiens began moving out of Africa. Within 30,000 years they had spread across Asia, Oceania and Europe. And the process continues.
Trump himself is a grandson of a Bavarian (German) migrant. His grandfather, Friedrich Trump, arrived in New York with a single suitcase in 1885 at the age of 16. He made a fortune in the gold rush in the west and opened hotels that cater to the hard working and hard drinking miners. He later returned to New York and started a small property business. That was the beginning of the Trump story  a story of how a grandson of a Bavarian immigrant became the president of the United States.
Moreover, Trumps wife is also a migrant from Solvenia. Media reports say there is a wealth of evidence to prove she was an undocumented immigrant.
All Americans, including the native people, are migrants or descendants of migrants. The natives are the first to occupy the continent. The Europeans came 15,000 years later. If the early waves of migrations are fair enough, why cant we treat the present wave of migration  from whichever part of the planet -- as a natural phenomenon Dont build walls; build bridges between people, Mr. Trump. Please recognise that the right to migrate to a safer place in face of economic marginalisation or political persecution is a human right.
Nation-state borders are man-made barriers created out of the ravenous reluctance to share Mother Earths resources with fellow human beings who are in need. This is xenophobia  the fear of the other.
On Easter Sunday this year, Trump in utter disregard for Christian charity, tweeted: .Caravans coming. Republicans must go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW. This week in another tweet, he said, illegal immigrants, no matter how bad they may be, [are] pour[ing] into and infest[ing] our Country. Infesting Isnt he calling the immigrants animals or insects
His policy of separating the children from their migrant parents drew criticism from Pope Francis on Wednesday, which was International Refugees day. The Pontiff said he supported the statements made by US Catholic bishops who called the separation of children from their parents immoral and contrary to our Catholic values.
Even though some 80 percent of Evangelical Christians are known to have supported Trump at the 2016 elections, he needs to remember Jesus Christs dire warning that anyone causes harm to children should be thrown into the deepest ocean with a millstone tied around his neck.
We are human beings, but being human means being merciful which in turn is a divine quality. Trumps policy of harming children is far from being human. The world in a chorus decried his policy as unacceptable. The American Academy of Paediatrics called it child abuse, Amnesty International said it is nothing short of torture, and the United Nations denounced it as despicable and an unconscionable violation of human rights.
Some compared the Trump policy to the massacre of the native Americans by white Europeans; some likened it to the internment of the Japanese during World War II. Others saw a parallel in the Nazi policy. Just as the Nazi Gestapo came for the Jews who were to be sent to concentration camps, Trumps border guards snatched the children away from their parents, showing no remorse.
Mind you, this is happening in the 21st century  the era of knowledge; the era where science has taken us beyond our galaxy to have a peep at the domains beyond the black holes. And this is happening at a time when a nations degree of civilisation is assessed by its commitment to liberty, equality, fraternity and Human Rights.
The US has long lost the moral upper hand to preach human rights. Its constitution may be described as the best man-made political document in human history, but its foreign policy, since it assumed the worlds leadership after World War II, has been a stink. Its commitment to human rights is a farce. Like a rogue state, it has observed International law mainly in the breach. In Central Asia, the US supported dictators despite their horrendous human rights records. In Asia, the US troops killed some three million people in wars in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos in the 1960s and 1970s. More than half a million Iraqi children died due to US-sponsored sanctions on Iraq in the 1990s because the sanctions prevented Iraq from buying life-saving medicines.
The US continues to cheer on Israel as the Zionist state, exercising a culture of impunity, kills unarmed Palestinian protesters. The US even uses its veto power to protect Israel, easily one of the worst human rights violators in the world today.
While the US practises Nazi policies at home, commits war crimes abroad and encourages Israeli human rights violations, it had the cheek to accuse on Tuesday the United Nations Human Rights Council of being a cesspool of political bias. US envoy Nikki Haley called the UNHRC a hypocritical body that makes a mockery of human rights.
Well, in a way, the withdrawal suggests that the US has got out of the kitchen because it cannot stand the heat. Perhaps, it is Good Riddance of Bad Rubbish. Flushed of protectors of human rights violators, the UNHRC will be less putrid. The US might as well leave the UN too, so that there will be justice for the oppressed people like the Palestinians.

Help Hasini
	

Father pleads to collect Rs. 700,000 within a week
	
	Battle of retired Army soldier to save his daughter from Thalassaemia Major

Hasini Imasha Rajapaksha, (14) has undergone a successful matched unrelated donor bone marrow transplant for Thalassaemia Major in May 2018 at the Asiri Central Hospital in Colombo.
Finding matching bone marrow had been the most difficult task, which they later overcame with the support of DATRI Gene Bank in India after paying Rs. 2,300,000.
The transplant was done under the consultation of Dr Lalindra Gooneratne, Consultant Haematologist & Director Bone Marrow Transplant Programme.
The parents, R.M. Aruna Krishantha Rajapaksha and Thushari Dilhani Jayasundara, are residents in Nikadalupota, Ganewatte. 
Their only child - Hasini was suffering from Thalassaemia since childhood and the treatment began when she was just eight months old.
She was registered in Thalassaemia Centre in Kurunegala Teaching Hospital under the registration Number 470.
He had been fighting to save the most precious gift in his life, day and night to raise funds making requests from well - to - do people as well as the general public. 

The total amount of hospital fee is Rs. 10,900,000, I have already collected ten million and two hundred thousand rupees but I need another Rs. 700,000 to discharge my daughter from the hospital within a week. 
- Father -
Parliamentarians Dr Harsha De Silva, and Rajitha Senaratne helped him, while cricketers Lasith Malinga, Dinesh Chandimal and Rangana Herath helped him financially. 
The Presidents Fund gave me five hundred thousand rupees (500, 000), father Krishantha Rajapaksha said.
I have been struggling to find money that is necessary for my daughters treatment. I was able to find one million with my own effort, there is nothing I didnt do for raising the money. On some days I would go to Kandy, come back to Galle Dewale in Minuwangoda, stay there until early morning and return to Kandy.
After that, I would return to Colombo, Rajagiriya and go from door to door asking for help. I have found there are still good people in this world, one lady in Rajagiriya helped me with Rs. 500,000 when I visited her house, she asked me to bring my daughter there, and it was more than the amount she promised. 
Rana Viru Sewa Authority also gave me Rs. 500,000, he said.
Hasini is a student of Kurunegala Wellawa Maha Vidyalaya and studies in Grade 9. She is a talented dancer and skilled in playing local drums (Bera)
Retired from the Sri Lanka Army ending the service of 22 years, father Aruna Krishantha Rajapaksha was an active soldier during the final missions of civil war in the North and East.
He is requesting for help from the general public to complete his mission of curing his daughter.
I have enough experience to write a book. I visited some politicians asking for help, but some of them kept ignoring me while some noted my presence but rejected helping me heartlessly, he said. 
There was a day that I cried after visiting a certain politician, who asked me Are you mad and your daughter cannot be cured.!!. 
I think I should not suffer this much, I have served my country for more than two decades sacrificing my life. There are still two shrapnel pieces in my head, which they couldnt remove through surgery, he said.
Whatever came his way, the brave father/former soldier is determined to raise funds for his daughter. His willpower and strength and resistance was tested endlessly, but he didnt give up, even if he was unsure of how people will react to his requests, he wont stop to catch his breath while his daughter is struggling to survive in the hospital.
There is lot more expenses since my child is to be kept in a sterilized room after being discharged from the hospital, to protect her from germs. 
Only her mother is allowed to be in touch with her fearing of any infection. Weekly check-ups cost around Rs. 30,000 because she has clinics every week for six months. 
The total amount of hospital fee is rupees ten million nine hundred thousand. (10,900,000 LKR) I have already collected ten million and two hundred thousand rupees but I need another Rs. 700,000 to discharge my daughter from the hospital. That is to be urgently collected within a week.
I have no properties to sell or any other way to raise money except asking from kind-hearted people out there. he pleaded. Please contribute and share.

Hold referendum on Sinhala-Tamil coexistence: Sritharan
	
The government should hold a referendum to determine whether the Sinhalese and the Tamils were willing to coexist with each other, TNA MP Sivagnanam Sritharan told Parliament yesterday.
He said the government had not considered the needs of the Northern people and claimed that a sports stadium constructed in Kilinochchi during the previous regime was being held by the army. The MP said the then Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage had profited from the construction of the stadium.
Mr. Aluthgamage rejected this allegation and said the TNA MP was up to mischief.
Meanwhile, State Minister Harsha De Silva criticized MP Sritharan for still clinging on to extremist ideologies.
The pre-hospital ambulance service has helped the people in the North but you didnt even have the courtesy to mention it. Tell us whether you really need it, he asked Mr. Sritharan.
State Minister of Finance, Eran Wickramaratne said Dr. De Silva should not have asked if the TNA MP wanted the ambulance service because the government should seek the peoples opinion and not the approval of MPs to implement such projects. We only need permission from the people to carry out such projects, he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

If Gota is going to be President, God help this country!
	
Judges of this country should be bold and be able to do justice               
	
	Wickremesinghe is grooming Sajith, Ravi, Akila, Harin, Sagala and me for the UNP Leadership

	The hub of extreme Sinhala Buddhist groups is Gota                        
	
	UNP and the Government arent given a fair hearing by media                 
	
	Were working on obtaining at least 40% of the Sinhala votes                 
	
	Arjuna Mahendran isnt a good friend of RW anymore. Arjunas appointment was very controversial                                                      

Plantation Industries Minister and UNPs National Organizer Navin Dissanayake in an interview with theDailymirror shared his views about the UNPs political future and the ongoing matters related to politics in the country. Excerpts:
Q The UNP a long-standing political party in Sri Lanka. But, in the recent past, the reputation of the party was heavily damaged due to many reasons. Is the UNP in a politically drained situation now
Our party isnt politically drained at all. We have got many second level young, energetic and enthusiastic leaders who want to take the party forward. I do accept that there is a lack of coordination in certain areas within the party. We need some clear dynamics to solve those issues. 

Despite having two state media institutes, we havent been given a fair percentage of news items. In news presented every day, 70% of it is given to the opposition

Q What are those certain areas lacking coordination within the party
We need to focus on certain areas which are more solid including the Sinhala Buddhist votes. We also have to give priority to the countrys economy and make sure that the economical benefits are enjoyed by thegeneral public. 
QUNPers demanded a change in the Partys leadership. But it didnt happen. Instead the same personalities exchanged their duties withing the party. Are you satisfied with the recent appointments
There is a new interpretation of what leadership is. The new thinking in the world is to have a leadership team for any organization. So, I think our Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe is working on that concept to give leadership responsibilities to a team which involves ministers Sajith Premadasa, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, Harin Fernando, Former Minister Ravi Karunanayake and me. 
All of us comprise a team that can take the party forward. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe is now touching 70. Leadership should change in any organization with time. Maybe he is looking at a phase where the younger leaders are given more responsibilities and made to take more decisions within the party. A leader cannot step down and just leave. It has to be a gradual process. At the moment the discussions with regard to the next level of leadership are taking place in the party.
 
QWho should be the next leader of the UNP
Second tiers are already in place. Sajith Premadasa, Ravi Karunanayake, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, Harin Fernando, Sagala Rathnayake and I are already in line for the post of UNP Leader. These are the younger leaders, Mr. Wickremesinghe are grooming. 
Q There is competition for the post of the UNP Leader within the party, isnt it
Competition is good. In the past there was good competition among Ranasinghe Premadasa, my father Gamini Dissanayake, Ranil Wickremesinghe, Lalith Athulathmudali and Ronnie de Mel within the UNP. When there is competition you have to perform all the time and show your capabilities. Unlike the Flower Bud Party, where there is only one family where every other member is surrounded and only one son is groomed by them, there is a good competition within the UNP.

QApart from UNP Leader Wickremesinghe, in your opinion who else is fit to run for presidency from the party
Either Mr. Wickremesinghe or Sajith Premadasa should run for the presidency at the next poll. If they arent contesting for some reason, the party has to decide the next best candidate. Our party has several other potential presidential candidates who are willing to contest. That is why I said that the UNP is not all about Mr. Wickeremesinghe and Mr. Premadasa. 
We were the political party that suffered the most when President Ranasinghe Premadasa was assassinated, presidential candidate my father Gamini Dissanayake was assassinated and two aspiring presidential candidates Ranjan Wijeratne and Lalith Athulathmudali were assassinated. 
In spite of all the difficulties, our party is still continuing very well. We were in the opposition for eighteen years which is a long time. However, now we are in power and thinking about our next step. To accomplish the next step, we have to perform, not just talk. 
During the next six months, we have a roll-out plan during which Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera has to play a major role in providing finances to carry out projects. 
The next one and a half years are going to be very difficult for Sri Lanka because we have to pay out the highest amount of funds as debts which were incurred by the Rajapaksas and passed on to us. The public doesnt realize the amount of debt we have to pay. Most of the debts are hard money loans taken from Chinese banks. 
Q Will the UNPers have to wait until Wickremesinghe voluntarily and eventually steps down and hands over his jobs to the next leader of the party
It will happen most probably after the next elections. It is a matter of time before the next generation of leaders take over. Maybe it will happen within another one and a half or two years. Political parties must have new blood. They cant be static all the time. I think our leader has realized this. If he doesnt allow young leadership to come up, things wont be favourable for him too. I think he knows about this. 

We have to work on getting at least 40% of the Sinhala votes. Even if Gota gets 60% of Sinhala votes, we are fine with it because we have 40%. UNPs plan is to consolidate that 40 percent

Q Apparently, already things arent favourable for him. Your comments
Let us see. We havent had a Presidential Election nor a General Election yet. So, no one can judge by the current situation. 
Q Is your leader Wickremesinghe protecting his close friend Arjuna Mahendran from being prosecuted in the alleged Central Bank bond scam 
I dont think Arjuna is good friend of Mr. Wickremesinghe anymore. But, Arjunas appointment itself was very controversial. Its easy to look back and say this and that shouldnt have happened. When you are a leader you have to make particular decisions given the parametres you are in. On hindsight its very clear that Arjuna Mahendrans appointment was a wrong decision. 
I am sure that the Prime Minister will also admit to this now because the country has suffered as a result. The country has lost Rs.600 million due to the alleged bond scam according to the Central Bank reports. That is not a huge amount of money.
A six hundred million loss is not a huge loss that some people are making it out to be. It is a loss and we should be sad about it. The profit made from the bond issue by Perpetual Treasuries cannot be considered as a loss to the country. However, the Government of Sri Lanka has issued a red notice to arrest Mahendran. Since he is a Singaporean citizen, it is the duty of the Singaporean authorities to arrest him and deport him to Sri Lanka. I am very sure that our Prime Minister isnt protecting Mahendran. 
It is a judicial process which may take some time. We have already notified Singapore that Mahendran is wanted in connection with the bond case. Its up to them to take further action now. We have done our part. This is the same situation when it comes to the arrest of Former Sri Lankan Ambassador Udayanga Weeratunga. Now he is in Dubai. The UAE can immediately send him back. I think it will happen soon.
 Q The names of several UNP ministers were linked with the alleged bond scam for accepting money from Arjun Aloysius. This again put a huge black mark on the UNP. How will it affect their political careers 
Its good that those who had financial dealings with Arjun Aloysius are coming out. Our party has nothing to hide regarding these names. All the names have to be revealed to the public. They can give their own reasons. But the people have to decide. If they took money from PTL, the purpose could be for election campaigns or for some other reason. Still they are under obligation to PTL. People must decide once and for all when the names are revealed.
It doesnt matter why they took the money because they have taken the money from the accused in the alleged bond scam. In this case, I think the people are the court. Justice will be delivered by the people with regard to the relevant politicians when they cast their votes. The votes will decide who is guilty. 
Q Supreme Court Judges recused themselves from hearing the Fundamental Rights Petition filed by Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Meanwhile, the Attorney General had informed Supreme Court about a Contempt of Court case against Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake over insulting remarks against the judiciary and the lawyers. Double standards where the law and justice are concerned are crystal clear here. What isyour opinion
I am very careful when I talk about judiciary of this country. I cannot really comment on this. If I say a word wrong about the matter, the same thing that might happen to Ranjan, will happen to me.


We have already identified certain lands for coconut cultivation. With the expectant increase of coconut production in the future, the price of a coconut which is 80 now will come down to 65-70

Q As a distinguished lawyer of human rights, whatsyour opinion
Judges of this country should be bold. They should be able to come forward and deliver justice without acting like that. I am very sad about that. Obviously no one can ridicule the court. If you say something against the court you will have to face prosecution. I am also bound by certain things which doesnt allow me to comment further. 

QGotabaya Rajapaksa is reported to be the Presidential candidate in 2020. Are you confident that the UNP can offer stiff competition if he contests
I dont think Gota can contest the 2020 Presidential Elections. My frank assessment is he being a US citizen cannot contest the elections of another country unless he renounces his citizenship (US). There is a procedure for that. First he has to make an appeal. To my knowledge, Gota has not even made an appeal as yet. 

Just because the media is being pro-Rajapaksa and not favouring us, we cant be having white vans, abduct journalists and threaten them. We will never do that

Once the appeal reaches US officials, they will have to consider all the facts regarding the case and eventually issue a certificate announcing that he is no longer a USA citizen. Only if you have that certificate, can you then say that you are no longer a US citizen. 
Gota cant even consider himself being a presidential candidate without having that certificate. Till then, all the reports making mention of him as a presidential candidate are really of no use. 
Q The disappointment people have in the present Government has made a considerable number of people demand from the Rajapaksas to make a comeback. What if Gotabaya becomes the President
Every country has a fate. Let us see what is going to happen in the future. If Gotabaya is going to be the President, God help this country! I think it is too early to comment on the Presidential Elections. We never know what would happen within the next one and ahalf years. 
We are on a good wicket for the next presidential polls. We have the biggest support of the minority groups (Muslims and Tamils). We have to work on getting at least 40% of the Sinhala votes. Even if Gota gets 60% of Sinhala votes, we are fine with it because we have 40%. UNPs plan is to consolidate that 40 percent. 

QHow difficult is it for the UNP to win the majority of Sinhala Buddhist votes when a social opinion has already been formed that this Government is against Sinhala Buddhists
If we look at the monks who are holding press conferences in relation to these matters they are the same faces that are hovering around extreme Sinhala Buddhist groups. The hub of extreme Sinhala Buddhist groups is Gota. The majority of the outer circle are very silent. Even with regard to Gnanasara Theras issue, up to now, the majority of Buddhist monks have remained silent. Very few monks are saying that what happened to Gnanasara Thera is incorrect. When a small group of monks appears on TV and when television news bulletins broadcast their statements repeatedly, the general public thinks that this is the voice of monks.

Q What is your opinion of the Governments media strategy 
The Governments media strategy is very weak. I have been always telling that its media strategy should be changed. I think it is important that our stories are properly presented by the media. I dont think the UNP and the present Government are given a fair hearing by the media. Despite having two state media institutes, we havent been given a fair percentage of news items. In news presented every day, 70% of it is given to the opposition. 
The UNP is not getting its stories across to the media. There is a serious issue with the UNP and the Government relating its stories to the people. I have always mentioned the fact that in principle we should have a full-time Media Minister. If that can be done, I think these problems can be addressed.

QWhy do you think that the Government was not given a fair hearing by the media
News items are created by media heads with a heavy tilt towards discrediting the Government. I dont want to mention these media institutions. I think you are aware of them. But, we need to have a reassessment of our own media strategy. Otherwise, it is very difficult for us. 
Some of the media institutes are controlled by Pro-Rajapaksa people. Maybe those media heads have different agendas to fulfil. People have to appreciate that we are a democratic Government. Just because the media is being pro-Rajapaksa and not favouring us, we cant be having white vans, abduct journalists and threaten them. We will never do that. 
Even if the Government is defeated we would be very happy to leave because we never chose the route of intimidation, murder and violence. It is better to maintain dignity and leave than remain in power using thuggery, violence and killing. 
Q Are you of the opinion that the conflict between Prime Minister and President was due to the 19th Amendment to the Constitution
No I am not. Actually, the 19th Amendment to the Constitution is good for the country. Taking away powers of the President and bringing it to the Parliament obviously creates a stronger Prime Minister. The President does not become ceremonial due to that amendment. 
In a way conflict is good. Unlike in the past, where the President with stronger powers did whatever he wanted along with his family, at present there is a dual system in which both the President and the Prime Minister are strong. It has its own checks and balances. Decision making may not be as quick as before. But decision making is correct. 

QThis hybrid system of a national Government is being done as an experiment in our country. Do you see it as a failure or a success
I think it is too early to comment. 

QYou have nothing to say even after three and half years of governance
You will have to make your judgements then. On one hand there is a slow decision making process which is more transparent with many debates going on regarding its policies and decisions. On the other hand there was a faster decision making process where commissions are inbuilt and the family benefits largely. People will have to decide which one they want. 

QAs an UNPer with many years of experience, can you describe the difference in terms of policies in the party when taking into account the past and the present
It is a different context. When my father was present, they had more political powers within the entire UNP Government. This was why they could move mountains. They were able to launch development projects very quickly with the majority of their members. 
Now, we represent a mixed Government with a President from one party and the Prime Minister from another. Therefore, it is difficult for us to implement pure a UNP vision. We have to make compromises and that is where the difficulty lies. 
The UNP has always advocated the rights of the workers in a free market. None of the policies has changed. In fact, the party has become more liberal under the leadership of Mr. Wickeremesinghe. We dont believe in giving handouts all the time. Under the SLFP Governments from 1994, the productivity of the country and the annual income dropped. 
The country that UNP handed over in 1994 is not the same anymore. There is a huge difference between how the UNP spent money and how the left (SLFP) spends money. What the SLFP does is take money from one hand, give from the other hand. But, the UNP is more towards fiscal management through which we work towards a rise in the income of the country while controlling expenditure. 
Concepts like private enterprise and free market were introduced by the UNP. Now all what we should do is fine-tune the free market, so that it will not only be about private enterprise, but also of the state. The state has a responsibility to act in prudence with proper management of the state and the prices. That did not happened under Chandrika and Mahinda. 
Instead, all the state institutions borrowed money from the Chinese Government at exorbitant interest rates. Consequently, the younger generation is now in a difficult position to settle the loans. For that, where do we generate income from Either we have to earn income from taxes or indirect taxes. Under Minister Mangala Samaraweera, we have consolidated the tax regime also. However, any government has to have a proper fiscal management in place. 
If the Government spends money the way the politicians want, the future generations will have to face the repercussions. The strength of Mr. Wickremesinghe is that he is a good manager. He manages things better than Rajapaksas. All what Rajapaksas could do is spend money. In fact it is very easy to spend. 
Q In 2016, your ministry started the Coconut Triangle project in the Northern and Eastern Provinces with the purpose of doubling the coconut production in the country. Still we get a coconut in the market for a price of Rs. 100. Isnt there any progress inthe project
I am getting some new lands in the North and the East. Discussions are currently underway with the Chief Ministers and TNA politicians in the provinces. The process of lands has become very difficult because when we ask for lands from them they always look at it as a Sinhala-Tamil ethnic issue. We have already identified certain lands for coconut cultivation. With the expectant increase of coconut production in the future, the price of a coconut which is 80 now will come down to 65-70.

## Title: Is anyone serious about reconciliation
## Section: Opinion
## Date: 22 June 2018 12:00 am
Is anyone serious about reconciliation
	
Reconciliation as serious social dialogue and active engagement is thus kept out of the Sinhala society in order to exploit votes
	
	What reconciliation are these Sinhala leaders talking about
	
	IF reconciliation is not between Sinhala and Tamil, then between whom is it


The week before last, I listened to Episode Five of my favourite radio programme Naada Sittam aired by SLBC on Tuesday nights, sponsored by the Sri Lanka Arts Council.
A programme thats researched, edited and presented by Vishnu Vasu, an Indian trained Sinhala Buddhist Gatam expert who is well versed in Dravidian music and in all aspects of Sinhala culture.
While Sinhala music is grounded on the Hindustani Music tradition, better known as Uttara Bharatheeya music tradition taught in schools and in universities for many decades, Vishnu Vasu presented proof of the influence the South Indian Dravidian musical traditions have on Sinhala music.
He traces the influence of South Indian musical traditions at the beginning of the Sinhala cinema that was pioneered by a Tamil, S.M. Nayagam.
Setting the records straight, he notes that the film Kadavunu Poronduwa produced by Nayagam, premiered at the Kingsley Hall, Colombo in 1947 January was graced by then Minister of Agriculture, D.S. Senanayake.
The musical score of the film was by Narayan Aiyar, a South Indian musician. Thereafter the early Sinhala films that followed had original musical scores based on Dravidian musical traditions till North Indian and Tamil melodies came to be copied wholesale. (For information and listening pleasure - https://www.youtube.com/watchv=YJzJJs3axpE )
In this musical milieu within which Sinhala music and song grew with music Gurus like Sunil Santha, Amaradeva, Somadasa Elvitigala, Premasiri Khemadasa, different genres were explored and developed, each with his own versatility. Yet, who would ever think the greatest musician and singer of the Sinhala South the late Amaradeva was also greatly influenced by Dravidian music It was an amusing surprise to listen to Amaradevas original rendition of the song Premathata kayamekayimanike with Vajra Balasuriya, penned by Sri Chandraratna Manawasinghe, alongside the Tamil song Kaliyugavaradan, kankandadevaneyam.
Amaradeva was not just influenced by the song composed and sung by the Tamil Nadu musician Periyasamy Thooran in 1908 as diplomatically put by Vishnu Vasu. Without a doubt, Amaradevas version was a direct adaptation of Periyasamy Thoorans Tamil song.
As mentioned by Vishnu Vasu, almost all who contributed to Sinhala music and song in the past were Tamils and Muslims.
The lineup would include Mohamed Ghouse, R. Muttusamy, A.M.U.Raj, M.K. Roksamy, Lakshmi Bhai and the more popular late Harun Lanthra and Mohideen Baig among others.
They gave life to Sinhala music and song from the 1940s to the late 50s and singers like Lanthra and Baig continued even into the 70s.
Having comfortably forgotten that in the past Sinhala music and song began with Northern Hindustani and South Indian Dravidian influence and continues to date, we have also forgotten that the Sinhala language itself is a highly pickled language like English that has been enriched through heavy assimilation of words borrowed from other languages.
The Sinhala language has a whole lot of borrowed words from Tamil, Malay, Dutch and English. I wonder if any Linguist in the Sinhala academia has ever thought of counting these borrowed words but Linguist Prof. J.B. Dissanayake notes:
Over the centuries, there was a tendency to borrow words from Tamil because Tamil was, from time to time, the language of the king and his Court. It thus occupied a prestigious position in society. During the fifteenth century, it ranked on par with the other prestigious languages of the island; Sanskrit and Pali (Encyclopaedia of Sinhala Language/page 621)
The most important fact is, these borrowed words provide us with essential words for conversation and communication in daily life.
The Tamil language thus dominates but so do other borrowed words that came of late. Think of those poor rural women who come to Colombo to have their visa to migrate as housemaids to the Middle East.
Neither of them nor we have any Sinhala word for Visa. No Sinhala Buddhist patient can ever Channel a Specialist Doctor in any other word.
You can never search Google without a Router and Wifi in your laptop and they have no Sinhala substitutes.
No one can ever travel directly from Kirulapone to Maharagama other than on the High-Level Road.
That has become more or less the official Sinhala name for High-Level Road right up to Pahathgama, Hanwella.
You would not find the Fax machine in any other word in any office. Shirt or kamise, kalisama, sapaththu, sereppu, saree, that you would wear before getting onto a bus or car and even lorry are all borrowed words.
Your salary is earned and not borrowed money. But the word padiya is borrowed from Tamil.
So are common meals in Sinhala South with paan and pol sambol for which red chillies came with the Portuguese.
Maldive fish came with the Muslim traders for the popular Katta sambole.
It is Dutch architecture that dominates the landscape in Colombo city and suburbs, and if not for the Dutch most traditional sweetmeat like kokis, aasme, kevun on the Sinhala Avurudu table would go missing.
Our daily attire is no more what Robert Knox describes. No more cloth draped around above the waist to knee high or below. No more bare-breasted women in public. Slacks and then Denim from the Imperial West is now the daily dress. Even in the remotest Sinhala village, the sarong would not be the ordinary mans common dress if not for the Malays.
The more important fact is that the Sinhala Buddhist history is no Eskimo history of isolation.
It is a history of cultural engagements and assimilation over Centuries.
It is integrating with and borrowing from other cultures and assimilating them over time that created and established the Sinhala Buddhist cultural identity with Hindu Gods and Goddesses, kovils within temple premises and rituals borrowed from Hindu religion.
A long process that began from King Devanam Piyatissa era and continues to date.
And with every borrowing and digesting whatever possible and convenient to our own liking has made Sinhala Buddhists feel richer and not poorer.
This historical fact needs to be brought to open discussion if political leadership believes there needs to be the reconciliation for a new future free from ethno-religious conflicts.
This fact that Tamil, Muslim, Malay, Dutch and British cultures added much in creating the Sinhala Buddhist identity and making them proud they have a rich culture, has to be publicly said and accepted to help Sinhala Buddhists face reality.
The fact Sinhala Buddhist cultural identity evolved through many mixed marriages needs to be highlighted for Reconciliation to become a living process.
Sadly, Reconciliation as interpreted and carried out by political leaderships both in and outside Yahapalana government, is reduced to rhetoric with the wrong and dangerous perception that Sinhalese are a uniquely pure ethnicity and are sole owners of this little island.
They have for the benefit of that deformed dominant mindset, continue to dole out infrastructure projects to the North and East as decided by Sinhala leaders in government and call it reconciliation.
Reconciliation as serious social dialogue and active engagement is thus kept out of the Sinhala society in order to exploit votes at elections on Sinhala Buddhist sentiments.
That, therefore, begs the first question, what reconciliation are these Sinhala leaders talking about And then the question: IF reconciliation is not between Sinhala and Tamil, then between whom is it
From 1948 Independence, 35 years of denying the Tamil polity their due share in policy and decision-making in an inclusive, secular State, was marked by making Sinhala the only official language in 1956, shelving the B-C Pact in 1957 and letting off anti-Tamil Communal riots in 1958, when Prabhakaran blamed for the separatist war was only a four-year-old toddler.
With more added against the Tamil people over the years led to 26 years of a brutal and a devastating war from 1983 and another nine years of post-war denial cannot be reconciled by keeping the Sinhala South as mere outsiders.
Sinhala South has to be brought in as the active and important participant in bridging the huge trust deficit for reconciliation to begin.
Reconciliation is nothing but bringing two estranged parties together in understanding each other.

What they fail to and does not want to understand is that the moderate and majority Sinhala Buddhist in rural South are not racist campaigners like the urban Sinhala middle-class that fall in line with Sinhala Buddhist extremism

It is about accepting errors and faults in the past and crimes committed against each other. It is about saying yes, we do accept we stepped too far and we are part of the conflict. It is about asking each other, But cannot we leave them in the past and discuss how best we could forgive each other, pardon or punish those who need to be pardoned and punished. Cannot we begin the future together
There is a not just a lack of political will, but a Sinhala bias too that keeps reconciliation away from Sinhala South.
What is said for media consumption by political leaders is therefore not translated into political action.
Political leaders fear they would be robbed of Sinhala Buddhist votes if they engage the Sinhala South openly for reconciliation.
What they fail to and do not want to understand is that the moderate and majority Sinhala Buddhist in rural South are not racist campaigners like the urban Sinhala middle-class that fall in line with Sinhala Buddhist extremism.
Thus there is no loss of Sinhala Buddhist votes, but more votes across all ethnoreligious divides, if there are any who would boldly face up to the task of reaching the Sinhala South for reconciliation.

Is it snoring or sleep apnea Lets find out before your condition troubles others
	


Has anyone ever told you that you snore during sleep Have you ever come across any family member or friend whose excessive snoring irritates you or disrupts your sleep Then this discussion is for you to get some idea about this condition which can even create untold troubles in ones married life. 

Snoring simply means some rattling noises you make while breathing during sleep. 

This is a common problem in our society and might not really bother the particular individual, but most of the time troubles others around. One wouldnt think of seeking medical advice for this condition, but it can unknowingly give rise to several negative consequences or can be a sign of an underlying illness. 
To talk extensively on this topic and address its medical aspect, we have our discussion today with Dr. Solith Senanayake, Registrar Internal Medicine, Lecturer at the Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Sri Jayawardenepura. 

Snoring is caused by the vibration of soft tissues in your upper airway tract during sleep. This can occur at any part of the tract- from the soft palate to the back of your tongue or throat or through a defect in the nose. 

Habitual snoring is a common phenomenon, occurring in almost 50% of males and 30% of females in the middle-aged population. This condition can occur at any age, but is highly prevalent among adults whose ages range from 40-60 years. With regard to children who snore this condition could be related to an underlying chest infection where the nose is blocked with phlegm says Dr. Senanayake. 

According to Dr. Senanayake, snoring can be the presenting feature of an underlying illness-and that is why we should be concerned. 

Snoring indicates increased resistance of the upper airway tract and the tendency of the pharynx to collapse when you breathe out. Snoring, excessively and frequently may indicate the presence of obstructive sleep apnea, a sleep disorder characterized by partial or complete obstructive episodes that occur when the upper airway resistance is sufficient to disrupt sleep. 


Snoring can also be associated with various other medical conditions like obesity, nasal congestion, abnormalities of the structure of face and skull, hypothyroidism and enlargement of tonsils or adenoids which results in an increase of upper airway resistance. 

This condition can also be present in individuals who drink excessive amounts of alcohol or smoke cigarettes and other Tobacco products. 

Therefore, snoring might not always be suggestive of an illness, but its better to seek medical advice if its bothering you so much, just to be on the safe side. 

When to seek help
If you suddenly wake up during most nights, gasping for breathe 
	If your partner keeps on complaining that you snore too loud or suddenly go short of breathe during sleep 
	Day time sleepiness or fatigue due to disrupted night sleep 
	If your snoring has become a real barrier to maintain a good relationship with your partner 

Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA)
This is a common breathing disorder characterized by, recurrent and brief episodes of complete or partial cessation of breathing, daytime symptoms of disrupted sleep including sleepiness, fatigue or poor concentration and signs of disturbed sleep such as snoring, restlessness or resuscitative snorts says Dr. Senanayake. 

He further mentioned that, OSA is a commonly overlooked condition among the obese which can directly affect your mental performance, resulting in adverse clinical outcomes related to day to day performances. Untreated patients also have an increased risk of heart attacks and cardiovascular related illnesses. 

Risk factors for OSA include older age, male gender, obesity, cranio-facial abnormalities, upper airway soft tissue abnormalities, smoking, nasal congestion and family history, so if you have one or many of these features suggestive of OSA, it is advisable to seek professional care in order to prevent unnecessary issues later. 


Seeking timely medical advice
Once your doctor suspects it is this condition he will have an extensive discussion with you, examine your throat, nose and mouth for structural abnormalities and get certain investigations done to diagnose what exactly is causing the trouble. He will further run a quick evaluation to know the severity of your condition, impact of it on your day today life and to decide on the treatment plan. 
Polysomnography is a test available to study your sleep. A piece of equipment is fixed to the patient which then monitors the heart, lung, brain activity, breathing patterns, arm and leg movements and blood oxygen levels during sleep said Dr. Senanayake. 

In what you call a split-night sleep study, youll be monitored during the first half of the night and in case you are diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnoea, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) will be given for the second half of the night to see its impact on your issue. This can also be helpful in excluding other causes of OSA, already highlighted in this article. Obstructive sleep apnea can be effectively addressed with lifestyle modifications including weight loss, cessation of alcohol and smoking, not sleeping on your back and instead lying on the side, receiving OSA-specific therapies such as positive airway pressure, oral appliances and nasal decongestants depending on the underlying causative factor. 

These methods will improve this condition in most of the patients, but some may need surgery if the condition involves anatomical or structural deformity which cant be addressed non-invasivelythe doctor said.

Therefore the take home message is its better to spread the message on how it can make a negative impact on the quality of your life and the importance of seeking medical advice at the earliest. Dont wait till the moment where your condition starts bothering somebody, he concluded .

Legal action against leopard killers: Wildlife Dept.
	
While stating that the incident where irate villagers of Ambalakulam in Kilinochchi had killed a prowling leopard was a criminal act, the Wildlife Conservation Department today said it had taken legal action against the people involved in the incident under the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance in the Kilinochchi Magistrate's Court.
Departments Director General M.G.C. Sooriyabandara told the Daily Mirror that they had provided the Courts with images and videos circulating in the social media with regard to the incident in order to identify and arrest the suspects involved in the incident.
Killing of this leopard is a criminal act. Accordingly, legal action is taken to arrest the suspects. The Police and the department are carrying out two separate investigations, he said.
He said it was reported that the villagers had obstructed the activities of the Wildlife Officers, who had gone to catch the leopard.
He also said the people should react to such incidents in a more sensible manner and added that the wisest decision was to keep oneself away from such incidents and to inform and let the lawful authorities to deal with the matter.
Meanwhile, Wildlife Deputy Minister Palitha Thewarapperuma said the Wildlife Ministry had ordered the Police to take legal action and the Ministry to conduct an impartial inquiry on the incident.
Deputy Minister Thewarapperuma told the Daily Mirror that Wildlife Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka had made this direction on Thursday, soon after this incident had taken place.
He also said the reason behind this unfortunate incident was some authorities fault in handling wildlife issues and it was not a fault of the leopard.
The leopard has frequented the area to snatch cattle and goats had pounced on villagers. The villagers have informed the wildlife officials of the area of this incident around 7.30 am on Thursday. However, the wildlife officers have arrived the scene around 11.30 am. By that time, the villagers have caught the leopard and killed it, he said.
He said it was necessary to find out the reason for the wildlife officers of this area to arrive the scene few hours late.
People who have committed wrong should be punished. This innocent leopard is not at fault. It is questionable as to why these people are so happy after killing this animal. They are even taking selfie with it. Perhaps, they do not know the consequences of killing an animal in such a brutal manner. May be they were too depressed with the attacks of this leopard for the past few days. Those people cannot even do their daily activities due to this leopards attacks, he said.

Nansen Research vessel in SL to conduct surveys on marine resources
	
The most advanced research vessel in the world, the Dr Fridtjof Nansen, arrived in Colombo to conduct surveys on fisheries resources and the marine ecosystem, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) said on Friday.
In a statement, it said the survey would starting in Colombo on June 24 and will cover the continental shelf and upper slope of Sri Lanka until July 16.
The last visit of a Nansen research vessel to Sri Lanka was in 1979 -1980.
The research vessel Dr Fridtjof Nansen is owned by the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad) and is jointly operated by the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research (IMR) and FAO.
The research vessel that will be conducting surveys in Sri Lanka is the third state-of-the-art marine research vessel that has set sail under the Nansen Programme, which has been implemented since 1975.
As the only research ship flying the UN flag, the new Nansen vessel investigates oceans, using cutting-edge technology and sophisticated equipment to help countries assemble scientific data critical to sustainable fisheries management and study how a changing climate is affecting our oceans.
A team of 20 Sri Lankans, including 17 scientists from the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA), officials from the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development, and hydrographic researchers from the Sri Lanka Navy will be attending the survey in Sri Lanka.
In Sri Lanka, sampling using the full complement of technologies of the research vessel will facilitate the investigations on the hydrographic conditions (physical and chemical), plankton, egg and larvae, jellyfish, demersal, pelagic and mesopelagic resources, and bottom sediment. Opportunistic sampling for pollution (microplastics and food safety) will also be undertaken throughout the survey.
After completion of the survey in Sri Lanka, the Dr Fridtjof Nansen vessel will move northwards to complete oceanographic sampling in the international waters of the Bay of Bengal including in Bangladesh and Myanmar before concluding its expedition in mid-October in Thailand.

## Title: Opera rises above the wine cellar

Opera rises above the wine cellar
	
The cast of Fiddler on the roof


What better way to celebrate Italian Week than with a sampling of opera If they could but see into the future, Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and Bernini would have dreamed of being great tenors. They would have loved, too, designing opera houses for the works of Verdi, Pucciniand Rossini. 
But everything has its place, and in the opening speech made by an Italian diplomat at the Nelum Pokuna theatre, Italian culture was defined as 1. Cinema 2. Art 3. Music 4. Food and wine. Give credit to the man for listing the likes of The Barber of Seville above pizza, macaroni and Chianti Classico. The Italian cinema of the 1950s and 60s belongs up there with the best of other art forms, But if Federico Fellini or Michelangelo Antonioni had been asked to make that list, they would have in all likelihood listed cinema below Italian opera and art (if by that the good diplomat meant painting and sculpture).
By listing food next to music, however, he wasnt far off the mark, for Italian opera delves into the subject of culinary delights with gusto. You only have to think of Don Giovannis sumptuous last supper and the orgiastic food intake of Puccinis bohemians. Isabella in Rossinis LItaliana in Algeri has Mustafa trapped between overeating and stupefied sleep. As if this wasnt enough, opera follows up by lauding drink as the natural companion to good eating. Just think of the pleasure that Herod in Salome takes in thinking of all the wines in his cellar. 
Its a good thing that none of the above was in the repertoire; according to inside sources, the orchestra had to make do with biscuits and soft drinks during four marathon sessions of rehearsals which preceded the final event. Apart from the conductor, and the soprano, there were seven Italian musicians here for the occasion , two female and five males  first violin, first viola, first cello, first flute, first of the second violins, first horn and piano, which was played by Mashio Junko of Japanese origin.

As if that wasnt bad enough, the Italian musicians except one remained very distant throughout the rehearsals, not mixing with their local counterparts or trying to put them at ease

But the ornate litter (or rather, the gestatorial chair) on which this sumptuous music carried was borne on the shoulders of a 60-member Sri Lankan orchestra. Except for a very few, they were mostly young. As we dont yet have a full-time professional national orchestra for Western music, this orchestra was fashioned out of existing entities such as violin maestro Ananda Dabares orchestra, the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka, and the armed forces bands, to whom most of the brass and percussion players belonged. Called the National Unity Orchestra, this is the brainchild of the singing duo, the de Lanerolle Brothers Rohan and Ishan.

By listing food next to music, however, he wasnt far off the mark, for Italian opera delves into the subject of culinary delights with gusto. You only have to think of Don Giovannis sumptuous last supper and the orgiastic food intake of Puccinis bohemians

The youngest member was a twelve year old schoolgirl pianist, and the two violin sections were filled with many young faces. The one exception to the military camaraderie of the percussion section was a lively young woman playing the bass drum. That was Rachel Halliday, who is an opera singer in her own right.
According to inside sources, inter-cultural relationships were strained during the frenzied rehearsals. The orchestra, many of whom did not know each other, coming as they did from so many different sources, had a tough time working under the rigorous artistic demands of conductor Jacopo Sipari di Pescasseroli. He expected a very high standard, perhaps not realizing that our musicians are never full-timers but people who teach or work at other jobs to sustain their music. Besides, four practice sessions were hardly sufficient to be brilliantly familiar with all the eight eieces in the repertoire. Adding to the musicians woes, the conductor often set a frenzied tempo for the faster pieces, reacting with a nerve-shattering glare whenever somebody made the slightest mistake. As if that wasnt bad enough, the Italian musicians except one remained very distant throughout the rehearsals, not mixing with their local counterparts or trying to put them at ease. One evening, the orchestra arrived to find out that the rehearsal room without lights and air conditioning, due to an oversight by the embassy about payments. In short, everyone worked under great stress in less than congenial conditions.
But they pulled it off. Sri Lankan ingenuity and adaptability, which has enabled people to survive abhorrent politics and public disasters for so long, finally allowed things to fall together at the right time. The conductor had asked his orchestra for a miracle, and they delivered, every man, woman and child. Its hardly surprising that soprano Sylvana Froli sounded inspired, singing Tu, Piccolo Iddio from Puccinis Madame Butterfly. Rohan de Lanerolle gave a mellifluous rendering of a La Traviata song, and the two brothers sang together Mattinata by Ruggero Leoncavallo. As the music soared, one expected to see things fluttering on stage.
The conductor was often seen at a crouch, his knees bent and arms outstretched, the classic figure of a man supplicating the gods  pagan ones, for Italian opera is not known to be pious, and that evening his prayers were answered with Dionysian aplomb. His movements were so lyrically frenetic that it looked as if he was overseeing some pagan rite. But thats what the music was in spirit. Its hard to think of a British, American or German conductor producing that particular body language. The heat exuded by this electrifying performance would be sufficient to melt even the polar caps, and it was all smiles, hugs and tears when it was all over.
It was a magnificent start and a great way to pay homage to Italian art and culture  whether we talk about Michelangelo Buonarotti or Michelangelo Antonioni, or Rossini, Raphael, Leonardo da Vinci, Bernini or Verdi, or the imaginative designers who made Italian design (from cars and furniture to clothes) so exciting in the first three decades after WWII, there is so much to appreciate and celebrate here despite the current sad plight of Italian politics. 
In the meantime, while we should be glad that we have a venue which can accommodate an orchestra and an event of this magnitude, its worth asking for which purpose this construction was made. Though its called the Nelum Pokuna theatre, I cant remember when a play was staged there last. Our dramatists cannot afford it. It isnt an opera house, either. The acoustics are bad. Musical extravaganzas are staged there from time to time, but the auditorium is badly designed and gives neck cramps to those sitting in the aisles. It remains closed much of the time, and its run by the army, which has no expertise in programming cultural affairs. 

While we should be glad that we have a venue which can accommodate an orchestra and an event of this magnitude, its worth asking for which purpose this construction was made

That doesnt mean that operas, ballets, plays and dance events cannot be staged there. Some interior redesigning could correct the flaws and the management can be given to a competent civilian authority. But where are the operas, ballets, plays etc All we have now is an impressive-looking structure awaiting a worthwhilecultural programme.

PNB thwarts cocaine smuggling bid at BIA
	
A 34-year-old Bolivian national who allegedly smuggled in cocaine weighing 11 kilogrammes using a novel method was taken into custody by the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA), a PNB official said.
The official told the Daily Mirror that under the instructions of Police Narcotics Range DIG Sajeewa Medawatte, PNB officials found the cocaine stuffed in several towels and some wearings using a special chemical.
The PNB had found cocaine weighing 11 kilogrammes and 300 grammes stuffed in three towels, two bed sheets and two jerseys inside the foreigners luggage.
According to the PNB, the suspect had arrived in a flight from Dubai on Monday (18) when he was searched at the arrival terminal.
The PNB official said the smuggle in method was a rare one and was the second occasion that such an attempt was thwarted.
They had thwarted a similar attempt about six years ago.
The PNB is interrogating the suspect under a detention order obtained after he was produced before the Negombo Magistrate.
The officials said that the detection was vital as it had been made on the eve of the the International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking which falls on June 26. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

PTL's alleged money trading: 10,000 cheques perused
	
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Haripriya Jayasundara, appearing for the CID, told the Fort Magistrates Court yesterday that the prosecution was perusing some 10,000 cheques in expectation of uncovering the PTL's money trading patterns, which was not an easy task by any means.
She explained this in response to President's Counsel Kalinga Indatissa, who questioned the prosecution on the progress of the investigation during the past two weeks as the further reports filed recently had nothing to do with the main inquiry.
SDSG Jayasundara responded saying it was a complex and broad investigation in which the prosecution was checking on other potential wrongdoings committed by the suspects under the Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance.
During her submission, she said the CID had recorded another statement from a person called Amal Ravindranath who confirmed the earlier revelation of Rs.3 million worth of cheques received by an MP (Sujeewa Senasinghe) from W.M. Mendis & Companies. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

The examination is the first step to a professional life dedicated to client service, continuing education, and engagement with regulatorsto protect investors and clients.

The Asia-Pacific region continues to generate the highest number of candidates, with 120,436 registered for the June 2018 exam, accounting for 53 percent of the total. China led the growth in Asia Pacific with a 48 percent increase in candidates compared with June 2017, followed by Australia at 36 percent growth and India at 30 percent.

The CFA Program curriculum is grounded in the practice of the investment profession and is updated annuallyto reflect the evolving knowledge, skills, and competencies that are needed in todays profession. The three-level self-study program covers topics including Ethical and Professional Standards, Quantitative Methods, Economics, Financial Reporting and Analysis, Corporate Finance, Equity Investments, Fixed Income, Derivatives, Alternative Investments, and Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning.

Each level of the CFA Program imparts a particular skill set:

 Level I is focused on investment tools and the foundations of the business, giving candidates the necessary knowledge and comprehension;
 Level II is focused on applying those tools in the analysis of asset classes, including equity investments, fixed income, derivatives, and alternative investments;
 Level III is focused on portfolio management and wealth planning, requiring candidates to be competent in synthesis and evaluation while making investment decisions.

In 1959, the Financial Analysts Federation (FAF) formed the Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts (ICFA) to establish standards of ethics and competence for security analysts, develop the exam, and bestow the title of Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) on those who passed. The FAF and ICFA eventually merged to form what is now known as CFA Institute. On June 15, 1963, the inaugural exam was administered at 27test centers in the United States, Canada, and London to 284 candidates, six of whom were women.Today, over 84,000 (37%) candidates are women.

Sun in Astrology and its influence on individual
	

The Sun, the giver of life, light and energy is the king of the planetary world.

Father of World
In Astronomy, the Sun is a star and the orbs that orbit the Sun are planets. But in Astrology, the Sun is considered a planet, the main planet in the Solar system.
The Astrological Sun is looked on as the father of the world and the Moon which too is treated as a planet, as the Mother of the world.
It would be useful for students of Astrology to gain a good grasp of the nature and characteristics of the Astrological Sun, as described in classical Indian works on Astrology.
The Sun owns the fiery and fixed Zodiacal sign of Leo. He rules the Kati, Utrapala and Utrasala constellations and those born when the Moon is placed in any of these constellations come under the influence of his six-year Maha Dasa under the Vimshottari Dasa system.

Sun represents `Atma, Moon `Manasa
The Sun represents `Atma or the soul and the Moon the `Manasa or the mind.
In fact, the positions of the Sun and the Moon alone in a horoscope provide the key information about the life of the native.
The Sun represents for predictive purposes, apart from the soul, father, personal magnetism, political power and Godliness among many other things. A strong Sun in a horoscope confers courage, longevity, good health, drive, dynamism and fame on the native.
When the Sun is Swakshetra (in his own sign of Leo) or exalted in the sign of Aries owned by Mars, the native becomes arrogant. For the ordinary person, arrogance is an impediment to success.

A fall Sun confers humility
According to Astrological principles, a debilitated Sun is a great asset to ordinary persons, politicians in a democracy, but detrimental to kings and rulers. In fact, some great men in history have been born with a debilitated Sun. The first Prime Minister of India Shri Jawaharlal Nehru was one of the world leaders who had been born with a debilitated Sun. Among the Sri Lankan leaders who had a fall Sun at birth were the former Prime Ministers D.S. Senanayake, Wijayananda Dahanayake, the first Sri Lankan governor Sir Oliver Goonetillake, former Ambassadors Sir Senarath Gunawardena and Gunapala Malalasekera. Humility is an essential quality for a politician or a statesman. A debilitated Sun confers that quality.

HERAT AFP June20, 2018-Taliban fighters killed around 30 Afghan security forces in multiple attacks in western Afghanistan, officials said Wednesday, in the deadliest clashes since the militant group ended its ceasefire. 
Militants stormed at least two bases belonging to government forces in Badghis province overnight and ambushed a convoy of reinforcements. Officials said the group may have used the three-day truce, that ended Sunday, to plan the attacks. 
More than half of the fatalities came from the ambush and roadside bomb blasts that hit a reinforcement convoy, provincial governor Abdul Qhafoor Malikzai told AFP.

Towards the 2020 Presidential Elections
	
Many names are surfacing in discussion forums about who should be the next president of Sri Lanka. Once the Elections Commission of Sri Lanka declares the date for the Presidential Elections by the end of 2019 well see all political parties making public their nominees for the post of president. President Maithripala Sirisena has said that he wishes to continue in politics. This would make him a likely candidate for this coveted post along with others including UNP Leader and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the much talked about former Defence Secretary Gotabya Rajapaksa. 
Most people have a love-hate relationship with former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, now pursuing a political career in an island nation thats choking with debts, lawlessness and rising cost of living.
Sri Lanka loves this man for playing his part in finishing a long-drawn ethnic conflict. What annoys people who walk on Colombos paths refurbished or decorated by Gotabaya is his past during which he gave scant respect to ethics. He showed that he didnt fear even the devil and silenced his critics and those protesting against him in a ruthless manner.
But we also saw how ruthlessly efficient he can be when he turned Colombo into one of the most beautiful cities in this island.
The man can deliver no doubt. Now, nine years after the war concluded, he has shed that military image of his and taken a businessman like approach to gain popularity with the masses. He has in no uncertain terms expressed to all, including the Rajapaksa clan, that he wishes to contest the 2020 Presidential Elections.
But the vibes generated by some people of the upper echelons of society relate to a fear psychosis about the man. Prof. Sarath Weerasuriya once asked why the GMOA, which questions the financial background of most organisations, doesnt question Gota from where he raises funds for his Viyath Maga programmes
Former MP and retired Read Admiral Sarath Weerasekara has said that those who state that Gotabayas US citizenship is an obstacle in his way to contesting the presidential polls are those who fear him. Former MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena recently said during a news bulletin that a prominent Deputy Minister in the Unity Government when speaking these days gives the impression that his lower body shakes while uttering the words Gota, Gota, Gota.
The educated and law abiding citizens of this country need to ask the question whether they wish to see a person they fear so much rise to the position of president Sri Lankans must vote for this man only if they like him, but never out of fear.
It seems that Gota has considered this thing called fear associated with his political career and now wants to show the public that he can be approached.
Now the vehicle in which Gotabaya is carrying his fortunes forward is the Viyath Maga Programme. Gota must take note that he is now dealing with qualified professionals and not with individuals who worked along with the Rajapakas, people who hardly had credentials but were bloated by the media to look important! His plans to boost the countrys chances of survival in the future show that he has picked chunks from Chinas Socialist Market Economy.
The 19th Amendment to the Constitution clearly stops a person like Gotabaya having dual citizenship from being nominated as a candidate for the countrys presidency.
However, we dont need the US to tell us that this island needs a person with maturity and experience to be the countrys next president. The Gota bandwagon has generated much publicity in their bid to make him president. But those who associate fear with him in this campaign without noticing are spoiling his chances!

Trump rescinds order splitting  migrant families
	

David Nakamura, Nick Miroff, Josh Dawseyreported for the WP President Donald Trump this afternoon signed an executive order ending family separation at the border.
The president, in an abrupt U-turn on the divisive policy put into place by his own administration, directed the Department of Homeland Security to detain families together so long as children are not put into danger.
President Donald Trump sought to stanch a public outcry over his administrations zero tolerance immigration policy Wednesday, signing an executive order to end family separations at the U.S.-Mexico border after days of insisting he was legally unable to act. Trumps abrupt reversal, contradicting his own aides defence of the practice, signaled a political retreat after an international backlash over images of hundreds of children being taken from their parents and held in cage-like detention facilities.
But it remained highly uncertain whether the presidents hastily drafted order to keep families together in federal custody while awaiting prosecution for illegal border crossings would withstand potential legal challenges.
The executive order came after a day of frantic White House meetings as administration lawyers scrambled to produce a legally sound document to solve Trumps political dilemma. Trump had begun to doubt his strategy, telling Republican lawmakers privately on Tuesday night that the images of the children were a bad issue for the GOP.

16 up the creek What is in store for the Group of 16
	

PROSPECTS FOR THE GROUP OF 16 SEEMS TO BE BLEAK
	
	NOT A POLICY DECISION.  AN ACT OF MICE JUMPING OUT OF THE SINKING SHIP
	
	VOTED IN FAVOUR OF THE NCM AGAINST THE PM
	
	TREATED SHABBILY BY THE UNP, JO AND THE SLPP
	
	TAKEN A DECISION, RIGHT OR WRONG, AT A WRONG TIME

Will the 16 Parliamentarians, who left the Government recently become political destitute in the near future They seem to have been left to themselves. They might have thought that they would receive a red carpet welcome by the Joint Opposition (JO) and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) soon after they left the Government in the wake of their voting in favour of the No-Confidence Motion (NCM) against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in April, which was not to be.
Whatever they had said and done in order to justify their desertion of the Government and in a way the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), it was not a policy decision. It was an act of mice jumping out of the sinking ship.
In the light of the fact that the Joint Opposition seeming to have let them down, it would be very difficult for them to find grounds to mend fences with the Government again on their part. And also the United National Party, the main party in the Government, is not in favour of them being taken into the Governments fold.
The Group of 16, as they are now being called, is now up the creek.
The 16 SLFP Parliamentarians voted in favour of the No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister on April 4 while holding Ministerial portfolios and the post of Deputy Speaker in Parliament.
In spite of the main allegation contained in the motion having been linked to the infamous Central Bank bond scandal, there had already been issues that had created a wedge between the SLFP and the UNP.
Main among them was the UNP treating the SLFP members in the Government as second class citizensand ignoring the President in taking major decisions.
These were issues that had affected not only these 16 members but all the SLFP members in the Government.
If the decision to leave the Government was taken purely on policy grounds, they would have taken it long before. Besides, they were not prepared to leave the Government giving up their portfolios along with the privileges and perks attached to them until the Ministers of the UNP, the party that had the majority members in Parliament declared that they were not prepared to work with those who voted against the Premier.
Even if they had reasons to leave the Government, they did not seem to have any issues with the SLFP to leave it and to team up with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
They had accepted the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena and declared their unwavering support to him. Some of them were in the forefront when the SLFP, going against President Sirisenas election pledge decided to field him as the SLFP candidate at the next Presidential Election.
They have been maintaining this stance throughout their stay in the Government.
Yet, they became hardcore disciples of the former President overnight after they were forced to leave the Government. Now, MP Dilan Perera, a leading member of the Group says that anybody who aspires to be the President must have the blessings of the former President.
This group, except for a few, worked against President Sirisena during the last Presidential Election and also during the subsequent Parliamentary Election.
Some of them joined his Government after he won the Election and the rest joined him after Parliamentary Elections at which the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) suffered a humiliating defeat.

After the SLPP swept the electorate at the recent Local Government Elections, they want again to join the winners

And now, after the SLPP swept the electorate at the recent Local Government Elections, they want again to join the winners.
They cannot be blamed for this decision, as personal interests always take precedence over national or any other interests in politics.
It is on the same grounds that they are now being treated shabbily by the Joint Opposition.
It was the No-Confidence Motion presented by the Mahinda Rajapaksa loyalists against the Prime Minister that compelled the Group of 16 to bow out to their portfolios with privileges and perks.
And Mr Rajapaksa publicly said that he would welcome them to his fold when the UNP showed them the door.
However, a rude shock awaited them at the doorstep of the Joint Opposition and the SLPP. They are now being treated as outcasts by both the Mahinda loyalist groups.
Kumara Welgama who boasts to be the topmost leader of the JO next to Mahinda Rajapaksa said last week that the Group of 16 should shed their SLFP membership if they were to join the Joint Opposition and stand as individuals - not as a group- at the tail end of the queue.
He might have forgotten that Mahinda Rajapaksa still claims that he is still a member of the SLFP and was appointed a member of the Advisory Council of the party on June 3.
Welgama also alleged that the 16 MPs were attempting to divide the Joint Opposition. His reference to the queue points to the personal interests taking precedence over their own political grouping.
He was apparently making this reference mainly in respect of electorate organiser posts of the SLPP.
When Sudharshani Fernandopulles name was proposed for the Deputy Speaker Post last month, some of the members of the JO did not vote for her. SLPP Chairman Professor G.L. Peiris during an interview with the Daily Mirror justified it saying They had certain reservations about doing it. It is human feeling.
Professor Peiris, with regard to the differences of opinion in the JO over the accommodation of the Group of 16 said: there is no reason for anyone to be astonished.

It was the No-Confidence Motion presented by the Mahinda Rajapaksa loyalists that compelled the Group of 16 to bow out

He went on to say these are the people who strongly backed President Maithripala Sirisena and accepted office under him. They were part and parcel of the Government, which carried out policies bringing down the country to the brink of ruin. They came only after public opinion became very clear from the results of the elections on February 10, 2018. ... They attacked the SLPP. They belonged to the Government that pursued the Rajapaksa family and the SLPP leadership. Therefore these feelings are to be expected. His remarks are clearly hostile.
However, the desperation in which President Sirisena is in, has given the Group of 16 some solace. Even after they attempted to team up with the former President making references against President Sirisenas Presidential aspirations, they were invited to the SLFP Central Committee meeting and some of them were given plum posts during the temporary reorganization of the party.

The desperation of the President was further evident at that meeting as the party had appointed Mahinda Rajapaksa as one of its Advisory Council members

The desperation of the President is further evident at that meeting as the party had appointed Mahinda Rajapaksa as one of its Advisory Council members.
Nevertheless, the prospects for the Group of 16 seem to be bleak, if they continued to be with the SLFP after the partys poor show at the February 10 LG Elections.
On the other hand, they are being treated by the JO and the SLPP shabbily. Have they taken a decision, right or wrong, at a wrong time

US Defence Chief  Mattis to visit Beijing
	
China, (South China Morning Post), 21 June, 2018 - China and the US are moving to contain military tensions and the risk of misjudgment, with US Secretary of Defence Mattis heading for Beijing next week.
The visit comes after Mattis this month rebuked Beijing for its military build-up in the South China Sea amid worsening ties between the two nations, and analysts say both sides recognise the need to step up communication to avoid the situation getting out of control. Mattis announced on Wednesday that he would go to Beijing next week before travelling to Seoul. Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Logan confirmed the visit, adding that details would be released on Friday.
He is making the trip after military ties between the two sides rapidly deteriorated in the past months over Taiwan and the South China Sea.
The US has said it would challenge Chinas militarisation of disputed features it has built in the South China Sea, and help improve the self-defence capabilities of Taiwan, around which Beijing has recently stepped up military drills.

## Title: Why Mahinda, or why not Mahinda

Why Mahinda, or why not Mahinda
	

Will those two faces endure, or will the fact that they are two faces, spell out the end of the Mahinda Force
	
	Support for Mahinda is broadly economic and cultural but is more often cultural.

Mahinda Rajapaksa is not the best thing that happened to Sri Lanka. He is not the worst thing that happened to Sri Lanka either. Popular culture and journalism have an unyielding habit of turning the most ordinary people into martyrs and devils, and judging by how they have operated in the last three years it is true that for a great many people, Rajapaksa is either a devil to be condemned to hell or a martyr to be beatified.
True, the man courts considerable charisma and this owing partly to the fact that none of his predecessors, who are alive can scrounge up and affirm at least half of the populism he so ably projects.
Whether this warrants a comeback, a Rajapaksa Restoration on the lines of the Bourbon Restoration is of course for another debate altogether. For now, the question arises: Why Mahinda, or why not Mahinda
Support for Mahinda is broadly economic and cultural but is more often cultural.
This is natural. Mahinda is seen as the saviour of the Sinhalese, the Diyasen Kumaru who has evaded our notice for thousands of years.
He is, to those who have turned him into a mythical figure, the definitive descendant to the kings of the Ruhuna Kingdom, who pioneered marvels of engineering and history which have been unparalleled ever since.
While its not always easy to separate the mythical from the real, this image of Mahinda Rajapaksa has stuck on to him for the better part of his Presidential and post-Presidential career, and for better or worse, it is what courts votes at the grassroots level, particularly from the poorer regions of the country which, as his detractors like to (erroneously) believe it, are housed by idiots, half-wits, and in one word, baiyas.
The truth is that the mythical aura surrounding Mahinda has been legitimised by what he has done and has persevered to do.
The truth is that Mahinda had a clear advantage over his predecessors because he sought to do more, much more than what they had ever done.
The truth is that in 2005, Mahinda was placed in a privileged position, so whatever he did, he did to the satisfaction of his electorate. It was simply a case of being in the right place at the right time. Everything clicked, to the advantage of those who wanted an end to the war and also to those who chose to head the war.
This is why most of those who joined Mahinda from the opposing camp, during this time, have chosen to stay with him (Among them, Keheliya Rambukwella). They know, and know very well, that returning to that opposing camp would mean political suicide as far as their political careers are concerned. Mahinda is a force, more than a politician.
Those who support Mahinda on the basis of his economic programme tend to hail from the metropolis, i.e. the suburbs of Colombo. This image of Mahinda, as an economic miracle man, derives for the most from the Viyath MagaProject, which is focused less on him than on his younger brother, Gotabaya. We do not know if Gotabaya has a cohesive economic plan (Shyamon Jayasinghe, in a witty aside, takes to task those who believe that he does have such a plan), but what we do know is that with Viyath Maga, the Rajapaksas intend on extending that mythical aura of themselves beyond the rural hinterlands and the South.
These areas will anyway vote for them, come what may.
The metropolis and the suburbs of Colombo, particularly those housed by a multicultural population, which is ethnically opposed to the Rajapaksas, are a harder, tougher nut to crack.
If we are writing about Mahindas prospects in the next few years, I think it is imperative to examine his prospects among this urban setting and what Viyath Maga has done to combat the image of him as a village simpleton.
The Mahinda Rajapaksa phenomenon is split between the economic and the cultural.
These two streams do meet, more often than not, but in terms of what drives them, what inflames them, the one is opposed to the other.
The cultural Mahinda and the cultural Rajapaksas have been propped by the Sinhala Buddhist intelligentsia, chiefly hailing from the Jathika Chinthanaya School of thought.
While the intellectuals from this movement have had their moment of reckoning with him, and have critiqued him on several occasions (In particular, Nalin de Silva), their support for him is on the basis of his supposed loyalty to the project, which was inaugurated by Anagarika Dharmapala and aborted by the expedient politics of S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike.
They want to think beyond Sinhala Only or Sinhala in 24 Hours. They want to think beyond slogans and pamphleteering. Their figureheads, which include Nalin de Silva and Gunadasa Amarasekara, include also Gevindu Cumaratunga.
These are intellectuals who wish to do away with a Sri Lanka that is run along the dictates of the IMF and the World Bank, who wish to be freed from the European Union and the US Embassy.
But for a cohesive economic programme which seeks to emulate its rival programme from the incumbent Government, we must look elsewhere, at the Viyath Maga coterie.
Key figureheads from this movement included (who else) Dayan Jayatilleka and Nalaka Godahewa. They rationalised the synthesis of economic rationality and cultural nationalism through a key concept: Smart Patriotism, the patriotism which brings together the nationalism of the Rajapaksas and the internationalism of Fidel Castro.
It seeks to be Rightwing but it is more Keynesian, more reliant on domestic consumption and production, than the Advocata-led thrusts of the opposing camp.
(The best example I can think of here is the decision by the Viyath Maga group to promote Dr Howard Nicholas, a Keynesian, as an alternative to the Advocata-promoted Professor Razeen Sally, who speaks of investment, free trade, and libertarian economics.)
The Viyath Maga programme does not sit in well always with the diehard nationalists, and many (including this writer) have accused of it being as uprooted as the Olcott Buddhism which has been written on and criticised by the likes of Nalin de Silva (briefly, a movement which emulates The Enemy, in this case, Western Economics, in a bid to combat and annihilate it and come up with an indigenous economic programme).
Both these movements - the economic and the cultural - are, despite their obvious differences, similar in tone.
They both look inward. Despite their veneer of sophistication, they are diehards in their insistence on coming up with an indigenous alternative to Western Paradigms of modernity and development.
But there the similarities, I must say, end. The one woos a mostly Olcottised population, i.e. those who are enamoured of the same Western Paradigms they want to do away with.
The former is led by diehard cultural nationalists. There are, admittedly, personalities because of whom these two movements meet, top among them Alle Gunawansha Thera (who has been seen in both Jathika Chinthana and Viyath Maga led conferences and seminars since their inception). But these personalities are not enough to bring about a coincidence of the two. They remain opposed to one another, while the only real factor which unites them is the figureheads they have hedged their bets on, i.e. the Rajapaksas.
Even there the differences are stark: while the Viyath Maga crew woo Gotabaya, the Jathika Chinthanaya crew seem to have second thoughts of wooing and encouraging Gotabaya on the basis of his fidelity to Western economics. As Gevindu Cumaratunga has correctly argued, on several occasions, what we need is a national policy, and on everything: industry, agriculture, politics, economics. We are not going to get those with a movement which emulates everything Western and Keynesian.
The Viyath Maga coterie have certainly managed to woo their intended crowd, a disparate crowd if ever there was one, but which consists, inter-alia, of the following specific demographics: former supporters of the Hela Urumaya (who hail from the suburban areas: Borella, Maharagama, Kirulapone); Sinhalese Catholics, who, contrary to the voting preferences of those who subscribe to their faith, are unabashed supporters of the Rajapaksas; and leading businessmen known for their nationalist views and, even if not, are tired of the policies of the present Government (which, ironically, is buttressed by the United National Party, the most pro-business party this country has ever had!).
With the exception of the fore Hela Urumaya group, these are not demographics which will sit in well with the majoritarianism and the ethnically-driven narratives of the Jathika Chinthanaya School.
But when brought together, they represent the two faces of the Rajapaksas, particularly Mahinda.
Will those two faces endure, or will the fact that they are two faces spell out the end of the Mahinda Force
