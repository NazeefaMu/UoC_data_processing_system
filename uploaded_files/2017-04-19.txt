Australia toughens foreign worker visas, Australian jobs for Australians
	
REUTERS, 18th APRIL, 2017- Australia will abolish a temporary work visa popular with foreigners and replace it with a visa requiring better English-language and work skills, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said on Tuesday. ??
Turnbull rejected suggestions the visa policy change was in response to far-right wing political parties, such as One Nation, demanding more nationalistic policies. ??
But in a Facebook announcement Turnbull said: ?Our reforms will have a simple focus: Australian jobs and Australian values.? ??
Turnbull said the visa change would attract better skilled workers and see Australians employed over cheap foreign workers brought in under the old 457 visa programme. ??We are an immigration nation, but the fact remains- Australian workers must have priority for Australian jobs,? he said. ?We?ll no longer allow 457 visas to be passports to jobs that could and should go to Australians.? The 457 visa was designed to fill Australia?s skills shortage and allow holders to bring members of their family to Australia on 457 secondary visa. ??
But the 457 visa has been mired in controversy with allegations the programme was being misused by employers to import workers on the cheap, not to fill genuine skill shortage. ??
?We are bringing the 457 visa class to an end. It?s lost its credibility,? Turnbull said at a press conference in Canberra. ??
Anyone now in Australia on a 457 visa will not be affected by the new arrangements.?

Benefits of solar power
	
Solar energy is derived from the radiation emanated by the Sun and this is why it is cheaper and eco-friendly. While Sri Lanka has initiated its ?Battle for Solar Power? locally known as ?Soorya Bala Sangramaya? the general public is encouraged to make use of solar energy for their daily activities. As our non-renewable resources are set to decline in the years to come, it is important for us to move towards renewable sources of energy like wind, hydropower, biomass and tidal. The main benefit of solar energy is that it can be easily deployed by both home and business users as it does not require any huge set up like in case of wind or geothermal power. Solar energy not only benefits individual owners, but also benefit environment as well.?
Listed below are a few advantages of using solar energy:
Renewable Energy Source: among all the benefits of solar panels, the most important thing is that solar energy is a truly renewable energy source. It can be harnessed in all areas of the world and is available every day. We cannot run out of solar energy, unlike some of the other sources of energy.
Cut down electricity bills: This is a huge concern among consumers in Sri Lanka. The highly priced electricity and water bills add up to their cost of living and by using alternatives such as solar energy, you will be able to save a few more rupees on your electricity bill.
Diverse applications: Solar power can be used for various applications, the most important of them being generating electricity.Solar energy can be used to produce electricity in areas without access to the energy grid and to distill water in regions with limited clean water supplies. In Sri Lanka drought-stricken areas such as Hambantota could effectively use solar energy for the above mentioned purposes.?
Low maintenance costs: Solar energy systems generally don?t require a lot of maintenance. You only need to keep them relatively clean, so cleaning them a couple of times per year will do the job.
Reduce pollution: Solar energy is an alternative fossil fuel as it is clean, reliable and also a renewable source of energy. It doesn?t pollute the air by releasing harmful gases such as carbon dioxide. So the risk of damage to the environment is reduced. Solar energy also doesn?t require any fuel to produce electricity and therefore avoids the problem of transportation of fuel or storage of radioactive waste.?
If you too are looking at investing on electric power as means of conserving energy, United Tractors is a recommended source. Many large scale buildings and industrial facilities in the country are powered by Cat Generators. Hospitals and five star hotels too rely on Cat Power for energy conservation purposes.?

British company introduced by CM not competent enough: Megapolis Ministry
	
Responding to Western Province Chief Minister (CM) Isura Devapriya, the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry yesterday said CM introduced British Company was not equipped with technical or fiscal capability to execute a project to generate electricity from garbage collected at Meethotamulla.
CM Devapriya on Monday said he came up with a proposal in May last year to remove the garbage dump at Meethotamulla but the Urban Development Authority (UDA) which is under the purview of the Megapolis Ministry failed to release the required land to implement the project.
Issuing a statement, the ministry said it appointed a technical committee comprising 12 members to evaluate the proposal made by the CM. The proposal was also studied by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management in 2016, it said.
?The technical committee compiled a report after evaluating the project proposal of SJP Waste to Energy Ltd. (UK). Then, the committee sent a letter to the Waste Management Authority?s Director in October 18, 2016 inquiring about 17 facts arisen from the evaluation report. The Chief Minister was also informed. Up to date, there is no response to the 17 facts from any authority,? the ministry said.
It said the evaluation report had recommended that the SJP Waste to Energy Ltd. (UK) lacks the fiscal and technical capability to execute the proposed project. ?However, if the Chief Minister is so determined, he can initiate a pilot project based on any garbage mountain and with the investment of local or foreign investors. There is no restriction to reveal the results of such a project to the country,? it said.
Meanwhile, commenting on Chief Minister?s claim that the UDA didn?t release a land block of 60 perches near the Meethotamulla Garbage dump to implement the project, the ministry said the company project proposal had requested a land block of three acres.
The ministry went on to note that the UDA had highlighted during a Kolonnawa Development Committee meeting in 2015 that about 380 houses near the garbage dump were facing risks. Thirty nine houses had been identified as houses which are at high risk.
?The UDA has informed it will provide alternate houses for these residents. However, neither the political authority nor the Urban Council of Kolonnawa had taken action following these instructions,? the ministry said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

The Joint Opposition (JO) today said Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya and Megapolis and Western Development Minister Champika Ranawaka kept dragging in finding solutions to the Meethotamulla garbage issue by always disagreeing with each other and even today they are continuing the blame game.
MP Gamini Lokuge said they too attended some of the meetings held to discuss the issue but the meetings always ended without any outcome as the Chief Minister and the Minister couldn?t come to an agreement.
?What they did to Kolonnawa, will become the fate of Karadiyana, Kesbewa as well. Though the court has allowed the Waste Management Authority to dump only 350 Mt of garbage at Karadiyana, the garbage trucks had attempted to dump more and only had stopped following protests,? the MP said.

Garbage trucks searching for places to dump garbage
	
An attempt to dump the garbage sent from Karadiyana at a ground in the Attidiya area was thwarted by residents with the support of former Dehiwela-Mount Lavinia Municipal Council members today.
The garbage trucks which were turned away from Karadiyana earlier today were then sent to Attidiya by officials, where it was not allowed to dump its load once again by residents and local government members, who gathered at the ground since morning.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, former Councillor Upul Gamage said that a court order had been issued preventing the dumping of garbage in the premises in 2015.
?The Municipal Council paid Rs. 100,000 per day to a private company named ?Burns? to recycle the garbage. They used some kind of chemical which damaged the environment and this led to legal action with the court issuing an order banning the dumping of garbage at the site from 2015,? he said.
Due to the tense situation, the garbage trucks did leave the previous dumping site, but were seen travelling around Attidiya and its suburbs searching for a place to dump garbage. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya today rejected the statement made by the Megapolis Ministry claiming that the British Company introduced by him was not equipped with technical or fiscal capability to execute a project to generate electricity from garbage collected at Meethotamulla.
Chief Minister Devapriya told a media briefing that the statement made by the Ministry was completely false and added that he had proposed the special project to remove the garbage from Meethotamulla.
?There is no use of talking about it since everything was over now. I did not get a chance to implement that project. However, we have never planned to generate electricity from the garbage collected at Meethotamulla as per the claims made by the Ministry,? he said.
He said a team of several senior officials attached to the Central Environmental Authority and the Waste Management Authority had appointed to evaluate this project.
?This team has gone to the UK to evaluate the firm and those officials have recommended it as a feasible project. I have never been to UK for any work attached to this project,? he said.

NMG Consulting holds reception for clients to mark anniversary
	
?
NMG Consulting held a private drinks reception for its clients at the Colombo Swimming Club recently to celebrate its 25th anniversary.
NMG Consulting is part of the NMG Group, a privately held company, focused exclusively on non-banking financial services and wealth management. NMG Group has over 1,000 employees, spread across offices in 18 cities, on five continents and was established in 1992.
NMG Consulting has been providing advisory services to the Sri Lankan market since its inception. However, over the last 10 years the scope of services has expanded and NMG is now the largest supplier of general insurance actuarial advisory services in the market. The team currently calculates the value of reserves required for 12 of the 15 general insurers in the country as well as providing strategic advisory services to banks and conglomerates.
Two of NMG?s partners, Matthew Maguire and Roshan Perera, hosted the event with leading members of the Sri Lankan insurance industry, including Managing Directors and CEOs of virtually all of the general insurance providers in Sri Lankan market in attendance.
Roshan Perera provided a welcome address and an overview of the firms? history while Matthew Maguire presented exclusive insights into the general insurance market in Sri Lanka.
Roshan Perera said ?We focus on three industries: investments, insurance and reinsurance, with our business spanning across three core practices ? strategy, management, and actuarial. We?re unique in the fact that our advice is backed by decades of detailed research conducted by our insights team.?
?In addition to the consulting business, NMG has two other core businesses, NMG Benefits ? an employee benefit consulting and administration business in Southern Africa, and NMG Capital - a private equity business investing in entrepreneurial financial services entities,? Roshan added.
Of NMG?s equity investments, the largest is iGO4, an online motor and home insurance broker in the UK, in which NMG owns a controlling stake. NMG Consulting?s actuarial team in Malaysia and Sri Lanka has supported this business with big data analytics and predictive modelling, as well as developing expertise in the area of telematics, which is an interdisciplinary field that encompasses telecommunications and vehicular technologies, to develop usage-based insurance. These are insights the team is able to share with its clients in the region.
To address the increasing challenges and requirements in the market NMG has strengthened its team in Colombo covering account management and technical services, including Big Data analytics.

Matthew Maguire in his presentation on the market results, commented, ?Recent changes in the regulatory landscape have resulted in companies having to think more strategically about their underlying business, and the consequences from a risk based perspective. This has led to a ?step change? in the ways companies approach their business.?
Matthew went on to say ?while the motor business continues to dominate the industry, the results for the industry will depend upon the experience of this class. With the ongoing regulatory changes following the ?full implementation?of RBC, companies are more closely scrutinizing their return on capital and how they want to participate in the industry. This is already apparent following the M&A activity seen over the last two years.?

The most widely known firm within the NMG Group is NMG Consulting, a global boutique, with clients in each of the insurance, reinsurance, wealth management and asset management sectors.

North Korea vows to conduct WEEKLY missile tests
	
?
North Korea has threatened to launch weekly missile tests after US Vice President Mike Pence warned that the ?era of patience? with Kim Jong-un is over.
Vice Foreign Minister Han Song-Ryol has ramped up the tension between the two nations by saying: ?We?ll be conducting more missile tests on a weekly, monthly and yearly basis.?
He also said that an ?all out war? was a possibility if the US responded by taking military action against Pyongyang.
The secretive state?s deputy U.N. ambassador has also accused Washington of turning the Korean peninsula into ?the world?s biggest hotspot? and creating ?a dangerous situation in which a thermonuclear war may break out at any moment.?
Kim In Ryong told a news conference today that U.S.-South Korean military exercises being staged now are the largest-ever ?aggressive war drill.??
He said North Korea?s measures to bolster its nuclear forces are self-defensive ?to cope with the US vicious nuclear threat and blackmail.?
Before adding that his country ?is ready to react to any mode of war desired by the US.??
The statement of intent comes after Pence, speaking in the perilous Demilitarized Zone separating North and South Korea, reiterated that ?all options are on the table? to deal with the threat posed by Kim Jong-un?s administration.
Pence said President Donald Trump are hopeful that China will now use its ?extraordinary levers? to pressure the North to abandon its nuclear and ballistic programme.
This morning he warned Kim Jong-un not to ?test the resolve? of the President and insisted any use of nuclear weapons by the secretive state would be met with ?an overwhelming and effective response?.?

Political reasons fuelling India-Lanka fisheries tiff
	
Politics, rather than science, is playing an important role in marine fisheries governance especially in South Asian countries, said Maarten Bavinck, a Dutch scientist, whose research projects include providing space for small scale fishers of India and Sri Lanka.
?The dispute between India and Sri Lanka over the fishing activities in the Palk Bay remain unsolved mainly due to political reasons, he said while delivering a lecture on ?Tropical Marine Fisheries Governance: The Way Forward?, organised by the Marine Biological Association of India (MBAI) at the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) on Tuesday.
Bavinck, a professor at the University of Amsterdam in? Netherlands s
aid the Tamil Nadu Government should initiate steps to reduce its fishing fleets in the Palk Bay to resolve the conflict in the region.
?Trawling needs to be contained in the Palk Bay, where fishing activities across the international boundary line have been causing social and economic hardship for around 25,000 small scale fishermen and their families in Northern Sri Lanka. This has led to political tensions between the neighbours?, he said.
Interacting with the CMFRI scientists,? Bavinck said science-based guidelines are needed to ease the tension in the region. For this, India?s CMFRI and Sri Lanka?s National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) should conduct joint studies and make coordinated efforts to find a science-based solution, he said.
The Dutch scientist said solid ecological and marine biological studies were required to estimate the damage caused to the rich resources in the Palk Bay due to intensive trawling.
?Fisheries? administrators should prioritise employment and the distribution of income among the fishing community as the sector is a very important livelihood option in India.
According to him, the number of fishermen is still growing in India because they are unable to find alternative employment.
?Economic development in India is centred around the cities and the IT sector,? he said.
?With marine resources largely concentrated on the continental shelf, there is no reason to go for larger scale operations in the country,? said Bavinck. (Indian Express)

Premasiri Khemadasa?s  lost songs
	
In his essay ?Tradition and the individual talent?, T. S. Eliot made an observation of poets that was taken to promote a separation of the personal and the social in the artiste: ?... the more perfect the artist, the more completely separate in him will be the man who suffers and the mind which creates.? When I read Eliot?s essay, I thought of two composers who were opposed to and accommodative of this thesis: respectively, Beethoven and Mozart. The popular image of the former as an erratic genius constrained by physical disability and of the latter as a quiet prodigy has, I believe, confirmed this dichotomy well. ?
?
Decades later (in 1986), Regi Siriwardena in an article resorted to another such dichotomy, based on Isaiah Berlin?s essay ?The Hedgehog and the Fox? in which those two animals were used to make a contrast between artistes who thought of the world as reducible to themselves and artistes who thought of it as irreducible. For Siriwardena, Beethoven was the hedgehog because his middle period (his richest) is filled with rhythms that pulsate with the kind of power he hankered after in his life. Mozart, on the other hand, was the fox, because (echoing Eliot) in his work there?s a separation between the creator and the creation. ?
That an artist goes through numerous phases in his career isn?t always proof of his being a hedgehog, although that thesis is manifestly valid for Beethoven. They do, however, indicate a soul in search of some meaning in his art. Which brings me to the subject of my piece. ?
We know Premasiri Khemadasa went through certain chapters in his career. We can extrapolate and contend that, whether or not Eliot, Berlin, and Siriwardena were right, the fact that these ?chapters? remain sharply distinct from each other is proof (however untenable) of the musical hedgehog in the man. Which begs the question: what were these chapters in the first place? ?
Eric Iliyaparachchi?s biography hints at three periods in Khemadasa?s career: the early sixties, the mid-sixties up to the eighties, and the nineties onwards. In the first period, he entered the world of theatre music. When I listen to the songs he composed during this time ? like ?Sirikatha Ena Maga? ? I glean a vague and uneasy disconnect between two musical traditions: the raghadari sampradaya and the Western melody. He had as of yet not resolved this conflict.
?
The second period saw him enter our film industry through Robin Tampoe. Initially (as with ?Samma Sambudu? from Ariyadasa Peiris? Sobana Sitha) he had been hesitant to break away from the raghadari code. Tampoe?s films ? in particular, Sudu Sande Kalu Wala ? saw him embrace Western music, while with K. A. W. Perera?s Senasuma Kothanada he made his defection complete. His middle period became his richest for this reason: accentuated as his songs are with energetic rhythms, he almost seems to brag about his defection. ?
Before getting to his third and final period, however, we must assess what exactly he stood for. To answer that, it?s apt that we compare him to that other giant in his field, Amaradeva. ?
Amaradeva?s career can?t really be chapterised, unless you count in those early compositions that echo some of Sunil Shantha?s melodies (like ?Shantha Me Rae Yame?), qualitatively different to his later work. But then for most if not all, his later work represents THE Amaradeva that matters.
?
His songs from this period are underscored by a deeply felt, though never flaunted poignancy, at once profound and simple. Coupled with his (for the most) spare use of instrumentation (as with ?Palu Anduru?, ?Ma Mala Pasu?, and ?Atheethayen Ganga Gala Basi?), this confirms what scholars and music lovers alike consider as his single biggest contribution: the sarala gee. In other words, Amaradeva was a simplifier who reduced North Indian classical music for the common Sri Lankan. ?
Khemadasa, on the other hand, was a flaunter. In the seventies, he went beyond anyone else experimenting in Western musical structures ? Somadasa Elvitigala and Shelton Premaratne included ? and broke into new territory. While Elvitigala died prematurely and Premaratne was denied the patronage he should have received for his versatility (I remember a prominent playwright from his time telling me, for instance, that he had the ability to move from baila to Beethoven in a matter of seconds), Khemadasa was able to move ahead and become the obverse of Amaradeva. ?
As with Beethoven, Khemadasa?s works represent the shattering of inherited forms: they dally with the same raghadari tradition he repudiated, only to playfully revert to Western rhythms (this playfulness is evident in such hits as ?Mey Gee Eda?). ?What is in my heart must come out and so I write it down,? Beethoven is reported to have said, and we can take this to be his principle when it came to rejecting traditional musical forms: he is reputed to have once recorded 17 different attempts at proving that a certain rule of harmony was wrong. That?s where Khemadasa?s opposition to his contemporary comes out: while Amaradeva was the artisan, he was the trapeze artist who used his compositions to project his larger-than-life self. ?
But even trapeze artists have their moments of doubts, which soon give way to self-reflection and, eventually, self-repudiation. That explains Khemadasa?s decision to purge his craft: an act that was seen as a betrayal by some, a necessity by others. ?
From the nineties, he diverted his energies to three different musical streams: his collaboration with Jayantha Chandrasiri, his experiments with the three-minute song, and his operas and symphonies. His work with Chandrasiri kept him back from a complete rejection of his earlier phase, though that did not prevent him from rejecting it with the two other streams. ?
When I listen to middle period Khemadasa ? think of ?Loke Jeewath Wannata? and ?Manamalai Manaharayi? ? I sense a search for popular acceptance. By rejecting the forms and structures underpinning these songs, he was in effect trying to get rid of his image as a populist. Compared with his work from that time, not surprisingly, his later compositions (?Sara Gee?, ?Suwandai Mal?, and ?Wala Athula?) lose out in colour and instrumentation. These are hence what I consider to be his lost songs, remembered only marginally (though celebrated nevertheless) today.
Of his operas and symphonies, while some contend that these were too imitative to merit serious attention, I personally think that the problem goes deeper than such a superficial critique. Opera, after all, unlike the stylised musical theatre which evolved here, was reserved for the top brass of societies that subsisted on class stratifications. There is a kind of aestheticism involved in it, despite its superficial elegance and interplay of music and words, which appeals to those who have the luxury of time and leisure on their hands. This fatal disjuncture ? between the kind of acceptance Khemadasa tried to get and the classist constraints of the genre he was working with ? explains at least partly why opera never really took off in Sri Lanka. ?
These are reflections, I admit, and for the time being I am done with them. I will hence conclude. ??
Beethoven, in his last few years, made peace with himself through compositions that were more graceful than his previous work. Mozart, on the other hand, never felt the need to tone down, because in him we find a confirmation of Eliot?s dichotomy between the creator and the creation, as a composer who never altered his music to become artier or more personal. ?
To compare Mozart to Amaradeva would be, I admit, a bit remiss. Suffice it to say, then, that in Sri Lanka, as with the Europe of the Romantic Era, we come across two composers who exhibited two different conceptions of their medium. Whether the one triumphed over the other, we can?t tell. There?s no point comparing a fox with a hedgehog, after all. No point comparing an artisan with a trapeze artist. In the end, we can only comment. Since that?s not my task, I will stop here. ?

Ravi J?s role  in preserving sovereignty
	
?
He did not misuse armed-guards or drive around for no particular purpose other than pleasure with security escort
?Pseudo and true patriotism of Wimal W & JR?s son Ravi Vimal ??
?The Prime Minister deserves credit for the fantastic job in fixing Wimal W for misusing 40 vehicles causing an alleged loss to the state of Rs 90 million. He should not have interfered in the judiciary process in granting bail ?under special circumstances?. Fraudsters who plundered public assets should be allowed to starve-to-death. As ?President Sirisena once said, ?they will burn in hell fire for eons?. However, legal action on the former corrupt regime?s Minister had other favourable side-effects too. It compelled the present ?High and Higher? Lucky Man who leads the house by Diyawanna to return 146 ministry vehicles that he had distributed among his cronies, henchmen and relatives, back to the Divisional Secretary?s compound. If not for Wimal?s case, the government?s big man from the hills would have caused a loss to the state coffers three times that Wimal W did.
The week belonged to two Wimals: Wimal W, the pseudo patriot politician from a non-political background and Ravi Vimal, non politician true patriot from political background. There had been quite a few write-ups on Ravi J, but little they spoke about his heroic efforts in the East for preservation of sovereignty during the height of terrorist activities. ?
?
?The other important news of the week was harrowing; which referred to a loss of Rs. 9500 million at EPF when it had refrained from bidding at the CB Bond auctions but buying them from the primary dealer or from those who had bought from him at extremely higher prices. ??
?While Wimal who shared the ?food? worth 90 mn meant for the poor tax-payer, with his kith and kin was deservedly starving in Welikada prison hospital, Ravi K was in Kandy to present ?The Banker? award, which was bestowed on him after being chosen as the Best Finance Minister of Asia Pacific Region to the Nayake Theras for admiration. In another event of the week we saw a front page photo in a newspaper where Arjun Mahendran was sipping his Champagne along with Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva, who defended him in Parliament during the COPE debate. Dr Harsha tried to reinforce the arguments of his colleagues theoretically to justify the method Mahendran had adopted to auction the treasury bonds. Plundering 90 and 9000 in millions are peanuts for our politicians.
??
?Ravi Vimal Jayewardene, the Air Lanka pilot is considered one of the best marksmen Sri Lanka has ever produced: he is the son of J.R. Jayawardene, the country?s first Executive President. Ravi who rendered a silent service was responsible for setting up the elite STF, [Police Special Task Force] during J R?s regime. Unlike the offspring of today?s politicians he did not misuse armed-guards or drive around for no particular purpose other than pleasure with security escort. Ravi J the former Pilot and well known nature photographer once told an interviewer, ??
??Politics? My father did not want me to. But he asked me to consider about it a long time ago. I told him that I was not concerned in politics at that moment, but would reflect upon it later. But I never considered about it and he never ever again.? He led a life of austerity and simplicity. ?
Ravi J?s role in preserving the sovereignty of the nation
?During the 1983 July communal conflict when the marauding mobs took over power for four to five days, President Jayewardene was visibly shaken, police and armed services were just spectators; in fact troops that paraded streets encouraged the hooligans and looters. Ravi Vimal Jayewardene understood that ethnic violence had no logical reasoning
Ravi?s role in preserving the sovereignty of the nation, though mentioned summarily in a couple of recent articles, the heroic task he undertook has not received due recognition. Distressed of the bloodshed that was occurring in ?border villages? and to preserve the unitary state, Ravi joined hands with a group of patriotic men from the city who had a plan and a course of action which they thought would strengthen the territorial integrity of the island. They built up a rapport with local Buddhist priests in many conflict affected areas or border villages, . Ravi joined Herman Gunaratna, an additional GM of Mahaveli, along with Devinda Senanayake, a grandson of D. S. Senanayake, and a few senior officials of the Mahaveli Ministry?they settled 45,000 people from the South to go and live with the Tamils in the Batticaloa district. There was no aggression, not a single Tamil living in the district was disturbed. Their main aim was to make the Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim populations live in these areas mixed so that the desire for segregation and territorial disintegration is destroyed. It is to eliminate the occurrence of continuous hostility, bloodshed and suspicion. ??
Taught villages the basics of defence and jungle craft?
?J R trusted his military top brass, when they assured victory over terrorists. Son Ravi was cast in a different mould. He went on to save the people; Ravi who at one time renounced the world, started disciplining the mind and was meditating in Thailand, changed his stance. July 1983 made him re-think his future role. He contacted Devinda who?s grandfather was responsible for setting up Padaviya settlements. The group decided to go ahead before the LTTE re-group themselves and attack settlements. Ravi headed the informal group; when the suggestion was made all concerned expressed their views, but the final word came from Ravi himself. He wanted the message conveyed to the villages of Padaviya, that arms and trainers are arriving. He knew that the forces were unable to defend the colonies of Sinhala and Muslims and that the best option is that ?they must protect themselves; it became the philosophy of the entire group. Ravi wanted the trainers put through an assault course, given firing practice and brought up to combat level at STF headquarters; all which he undertook to do himself. The informal group maintained the strictest secrecy about their actions though there were no secrets among themselves. Ravi saw the crises from the angle of the soldier; believed they can only be stopped by defeating them militarily. The trained soldiers taught villagers the basic methods of defence and jungle craft. ??
?The politicians were talking of arming and training the settlers, but had no idea how this was going to be done. Ravi ushered in a phase in the war by transferring it from soldiers to the very people who were the target of the terrorists. ??
?When the 14-seater helicopter landed, Buddhist priests had organized a crowd of volunteers from the area. Later, the famous Dimbulagala Seelaratna Thera too joined to meet Ravi who was an alert soldier by then. The Padaviya camp commander was overjoyed as he had awaited this moment for two long years. When Rev. Dimbulagala requested Ravi to address the gathering he flatly refused saying ?I am not a politician, I have come to make every villager here a soldier.? The two priest joined the rest of the team for ?copter ride to a place near the Dollar and Kent farms, where the Maduru Oya settlers were being rehabilitated. The commander there took them in vehicles to the venue, a dangerous place deep into enemy territory. Ravi?s and his sons? presence made everyone anxious. Dimbulagala Thera spoke to the people giving assurance saying President JR?s son and D. S. Senanayake?s grandson had come to their rescue. ?
The Compassionate champion marksman?
The champion marksman, Ravindra Vimal Jayewardene, grandson of SC Judge EW, and Great-great-great grandson of Don Adrian the Intelligent agent of both Dutch and British rulers, represented the country in many international games and led the Sri Lankan team to the Tokyo Olympics in 1954. He once demonstrated his skills. Ravi knocks out all enemies within four seconds; being asked how quickly can he pull the revolver and shoot, Ravi had his gun out in a fraction of a second and said that he can shoot 12 people in eight seconds; in a lighter vein he ?confessed?, ?I have still not killed a living being with a gun all my life.? ?
To serve masses one needs not to be a politician. ??
?The only motive that can keep politics pure is the motive of doing good for one?s country and its people.?

Ravi Jayewardene  The driving force  behind Air Lanka
	
In the several eulogies delivered at Ravi Jayewardene?s funeral on April 6, and the many articles published since then, no mention has been made of the sacrifices he was prepared to make to promote and set up a National Airline or a ?flag carrier? for Sri Lanka. I therefore take this opportunity to fill in the blanks by bringing these facts to light as a tribute to his memory because on his own he would never have mentioned them. ??
I came to know Ravi, as a colleague at the Civil Aviation Flying School in Ratmalana, where we were training for a career as professional Airline pilots. He was known as Ravi by all those who came in contact with him and hardly referred to as the son of one of Sri Lanka?s most illustrious political leaders. ??
Ravi turned out to be an excellent pilot in all areas of Commercial flying, additionally excelling in aerobatics. He made it a point to join the other trainee pilots in all the fun and mischief that the group of young airmen were involved in, even eating out with us at cheap wayside food outlets and going with us for movies and occupying the cheapest seats. Ravi always found time to listen to and help any person who came to him for assistance. He helped them all in whatever way he could and I know of none who was turned away. In lighter vein we described it as his fee-less ?private practice?. This side of his character amazed the rest of us, who only had the time to talk about airplanes and lived mainly focused on flying Airplanes. Ravi also excelled as a Rifle and Pistol Shooter and won several Awards both nationally and internationally, representing Sri Lanka at the Tokyo Olympics and the Asian Games. ??
After qualifying as a Commercial Pilot, which also required a candidate to pass the Theory part of the examination set by the British Board of Trade, Ravi achieved his ambition of becoming an Airline Pilot in 1969 by being selected to join Air Ceylon as a First Officer on the Avro aircraft. He was joined by three of his batch mates -- Nihal Jayawickrema, R. Baladharan and myself for whom this was a dream come true. ??
Needless to say, Ravi performed his duties earning the reputation of being very Safe and Reliable Airline Pilot -- the greatest compliment that could be paid to one of them. ??
In the course of time, Ravi came to know first-hand the problems that slowed down the progress of Civil Aviation in Sri Lanka mainly because of the reluctance of the Airline Management to keep up with the rapid strides taken by the Aviation industry worldwide. Instead of training and developing the airline?s human resources and the infrastructure facilities, the management, hand in hand with the then political powers-that-be paid little or no heed to the local aviation scene other than being keen to sell Sri Lanka?s Sovereign Air Service Rights to various Foreign Airlines whenever possible. ??
Try as he might, Ravi never had the opportunity to change this situation and sadly though, a few years later suffered his first heart attack, which cut short his career as an Airline Pilot. This health condition continued to plague him for the rest of his life, finally leading to his recent demise. I remember walking into his room at Ratnam?s Hospital after his heart attack and the first words he spoke was, ?That?s the end of my flying?. At the time neither was by-pass surgery nor stent insertion acceptable according to the medical Standards for Airline pilots. Shortly after, Ravi left Sri Lanka, first for a short period to study and to practice Buddhism in Thailand and thereafter to live in Australia with his wife Penny. ??
Civil Aviation in Sri Lanka cruised along as in the past, though a few unsuccessful attempts were made to change its flight path with more Sri Lankans recruited and several efforts being made to correct the situation ending in failure because of management and political agendas. ??
From time to time I corresponded with Ravi about these futile attempts to give Sri Lanka an Airline it deserved. In 1977, Ravi?s father, J.R. Jayewardena was elected Prime Minister. His government decided to close down Air Ceylon -- because of the heavy losses it was incurring and the rampant corruption plaguing the Airline -- and launch a new National Airline as a joint-venture operation. It was then that I received an Aerogram from Ravi saying he now had the opportunity of launching the proposed Airline so that it will be of benefit to the many talented Sri Lankans interested in Aviation. ??
Ravi envisaged that the proposed Airline would have a free hand to be operated and managed without any political interference and being only answerable to the then President J.R. Jayewardene, who was also the Minister of Aviation. Ravi had plenty of work to do, which meant several trips to Sri Lanka to achieve his goal. ??
Nothing much seemed to be happening on the matters that Ravi had worked so hard and diligently. Some two months later, I got another aerogram from Ravi, asking me to go immediately and meet his father to tell him that unless this proposed Airline started up soon and in the manner agreed to by President Jayewardena, Ravi would never return to Sri Lanka. This side of his character increased my estimation of my friend Ravi and left me wondering whether anyone else would even contemplate such a deed for such a personally unrelated cause. A strange sight greeted me when I walked into the President?s Residence ?Braemar? in Ward Place the next morning, in the outer verandah were seated several top bureaucrats of the day some of whom were handling Aviation hoping perhaps one of them would head the new Airline. I was ushered into the President?s room. He called me in and said, ?I say. Ravi says he will never return unless I start this Airline in the way he has asked for and that it has to be done right away.? I responded, ?Yes Sir, Ravi has written to me as well saying the same thing and knowing Ravi, once he has made up his mind he will never change it?, to which the President replied, ?I know. What?s the use of my being President and having all this, without my only son being by my side, come and meet me for lunch at Presidents House today and I will issue all the necessary directives to get it off the ground.? ??
So was born Air Lanka, which won many accolades for its high Service Standards while being much-respected as Sri Lanka?s ?flag carrier? with Sri Lankan pilots piloting the latest and largest aircraft and Sri Lankan Engineers setting new benchmarks by maintaining the aircraft according to the highest Standards.Thanks are due to Ravi Jayewardene?s single handed efforts and single minded purpose against so many odds for no personal gain or glory.
??
With his former colleagues busy flying airplanes to many parts of the world and being involved either directly or indirectly in the actual operations of Air Lanka, a lifestyle we only dreamt of earlier, I had on several occasions asked Ravi to join us. He always declined, saying he was happy to sit back and watch Sri Lankans having this great opportunity in Aviation and assured me of his support at all times to help in achieving our goals, a promise he always kept. ??
?Ask not what your Country can do for you, but what you can do for your Country,? were words made famous by US President John F. Kennedy and instilled many years before in the hearts and minds of schoolboys by Warden Buck of S. Thomas?s College, the other school which Ravi and his forefathers attended. These words would illustrate and summarize the unique life and times of Ravi Jayewardene. ?
May Ravi find Eternal Rest and Peace he so richly deserves for all his endeavours on Earth. Rest in Peace my dear friend. ??

Shooting  won?t stop us:  Tamil Nadu fishermen
	
It is all about a good catch
?
At the break of dawn on March 05, 2017, as the rest of world was sleeping, Charles and four other fishermen fired up the engine of their trawler and left for fishing from Pamban Island, Rameswaram, India. Charles and his fellow fishermen were waiting for hours after setting the net in the middle of the sea near Danushkodi. Later, Charles pulled the net into the trawler and checked what was?collected, but it was empty. ??
The fishermen were anxious as they did not want to return empty-handed. One of the fishermen suggested to sail a little far and see whether they would be able to get a good catch. Charles and the others have already heard of stories of local fishermen being arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy when they tried to reach Sri Lankan Island Kachchaithivu which is known as rich with fish and aquatic resources. ??
With hopes of getting nets filled with prawns, fish and crabs, they set the nets in the seas near Kachchaithivu and started having lunch prepared by their wives. Suddenly, they spotted patrol boats of the Sri Lanka Navy that were nearing them. Charles threw his lunch aside and tried to turn the trawler to escape being arrested. However, his effort was to no avail. The Navy arrested Charles and his fellow fishermen on charges of trespassing Sri Lankan waters and using trawlers, which is illegal in Sri Lanka.
??
Thirty year old Charles and the other fishermen aged between 28-35 were taken to the Talaimannar (SLNS Thammanna) Navy Camp. Mannar Court ordered them to be remanded for two weeks at Vavuniya Prison. Charles claimed that they were forced to sleep in toilets on the first day in prison. He also said they didn?t eat anything for two days after having home-made lunch minutes before being arrested in the sea.
??
Meanwhile, the Sri Lankan government decided to release some 85 Tamil Nadu fishermen in a goodwill gesture on March 11 after four days of the controversial death of a 21-year-old Rameswaram fisherman Britto who was shot allegedly by the Sri Lanka Navy. Charles was one of 85 fishermen who were lucky enough to return home even before completing the period of imprisonment. ??
?
They see no borders ?
?
The Chairperson of the All India Traditional Fishermen?s Association X. Chinnathambi, said Tamil Nadu fishermen would brave any dangerous water in order to get a good catch because they call themselves hunters. ?
?Our lives are very tiring and dangerous as with every fisherman in any country including Sri Lanka. When we leave home to the sea for three to five days at a time, ?we don?t know whether we will come back safe. Our families are always anxious due to the uncertainty of our profession. Our life is all about fighting with waves to get the best catch. We are working hard because we don?t want to hand over this profession to our future generation. We don?t want them to face the struggle which we are facing. We want to send our children to school to hold other jobs and lead better lives. We cross the international maritime border as we can?t find enough fish on the Indian side,? Chinnathambi said. ?
He said beating, arresting or shooting of Tamil Nadu fishermen will not stop them coming to Sri Lankan waters. ??
Meanwhile, Chinnathambi alleged that four of his brothers had died in the sea after being shot by the Sri Lanka Navy. ??
?I want to say something to the Sri Lanka Navy. You shoot or not, we are coming to your waters. We are hunters. We can see no borders in the sea. All we need is fish. If we were afraid of death, we would not choose fishing as our profession. Even when we have lost our father, brothers and relatives, we still continue to fish in that region,? he said.
?
Centuries-old fraternity ?
?
Meanwhile, the Daily Mirror interviewed the Chairperson of the National Fisherfolk Forum (NFF) M. Ilango who is fully involved in the subject. ?
?The fishermen in five districts of Tamil Nadu (Nagapattinam, Ramanathapuram, Pudukottai, Thanjavur and Thiruvarur and Karaikal of Puducherry UT) fish for their livelihood in the Palk Strait, the sea between India and Sri Lanka. For centuries the traditional fishermen of India and Sri Lanka have fished in the region in between the two countries with mutual fraternity and friendship. The fishermen from the North and North East region of Sri Lanka used to reach the shores of Tamil Nadu and would get their fishes sold, would stay back and eat in the houses of Tamil fishermen, stay over night to see movies of popular actors such as MGR and Sivaji Ganesan. The scenario drastically changed after 1983 when civil unrest arose in Sri Lanka. As a result, the fishermen of both the sides found it difficult to fish peacefully,? he said, explaining how the problems for the fishermen of both countries started.
After the LTTE war began in the Northern Part of Sri Lanka, fishing in Sri Lankan waters for Tamil Nadu fishermen was banned due to fears of arms and drugs transportation for LTTE via sea. Speaking about the ban, Mr. Ilango said there were reasons for the Sri Lankan Navy to start looking at the Indian fishermen as criminals. ??
Illegal activities in the disguise of fishing ?
?
According to Mr. Ilango, since the fishermen of the region other than Rameswaram and the 5 other concerned districts work under the traditional fisher panchayat system, they have never been involved in any illegal activities. However, people from non-fishing communities of Tamil Nadu started getting involved in fishing in the Rameswaram area.?
Those non fisher community people ?infiltrated the fisher communities and were involved in illegal activities in the disguise of fishing, he revealed.?
He said because of a few who engaged in illegal activities, the Sri Lankan Navy had been chasing even the fishermen who were actually fishing in the region, attacked and even shot them down sometimes. ?The boats were even sunk by them, their fishing gear destroyed and the equipments and boats were confiscated. Around 600 fishermen were killed and over 1500 were wounded. The fishermen who fish for subsistence were treated as enemies and are being attacked by the Sri Lankan Navy,??he alleged. ?

?
Disastrous trawling techniques ?
?
However, in ?1954 the Indian Ministry of Agriculture introduced trawling nets fishing technique to Indian fishermen under the Indo Norwegian Project (INP) aimed for developing fishing technology. The fishing technique is banned in Sri Lanka due to the damage of the seabed. As a result of the introduction of the new fishing technique, even traditional fishermen got involved in mechanized trawling. ?
?Looking at the devastation caused to our waters, we are forced to think that the government of Norway introduced trawling to India with the sole objective of destroying the marine resources of India. We have understood this at the very end of the resource depletion,? he said. ?
Mr. Ilango said despite Sri Lankan fishermen demanding that trawling should be given up, Indian fishermen are not willing to give up trawling. ?
According to him, about 95% of Indian fishermen do not even have a house or owned land. They live in puramboke land either in thatched houses or temporary stone walled houses. As they do not have their own land, they cannot provide landed collateral to Indian banks to obtain loans to set up boats and gear. ??
Their demands and proposals ?
?
Mr. Ilango has got some proposals and solutions through which he believes the problem can be solved. ?
?It is the duty of the Indian governments, central and the state, to ensure that the fishermen of the region have livelihood option that would encourage them to give up fishing in the region between the two countries. If the fishermen are forced to take up solutions on their own without the support of the governments, then it will only lead to competing within the shallow water resources, resulting in loss of income for everyone of them. After spending thousands of rupees from loans for fuel and food stock for the camp fishing, quite often the fishermen end up selling for a cost lower than what they have spent. There is no guarantee of income and safety against loss. Hence it is important to provide loans upto Rs. 1 crore with a subsidy of 50%. For the loan amount of Rs. 50 Lakhs the very boat to be bought is to be taken on hypothecation. Funds should be provided through National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) refinancing schemes and through the Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency (MUDRA) scheme,? he said. ?
He emphasized that the loan scheme should be introduced throughout the country immediately and for the fishermen who fished in the waters between India and Sri Lanka as the first set. ??
He proposed a survey that should be done in the given 6 districts to identify those traditional fishermen who wish to go to deep sea under the new scheme of the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ?
?Boats of those who did not wish to go into the deep sea, shall be bought by the government so as to make them incapacitated for use. A suitable compensation shall be provided for the same so that they can venture into other livelihood options. We insist that the scheme should be available only to the traditional fisher families in the Rameswaram region. Since the others are involved in illegal actitivies under the guise of fishing, resolving the issue is being delayed. And so their boats shall be simply taken over by the government and a compensation shall be provided. It is only thus we can arrive at a long standing solution to the issue of the Palk Bay region,? he added. ?
He said the fishermen could consider engaging in deep sea fishing only if the Indian authorities improve their boats with basic facilities that are needed to suit deep sea fishing. ??
?As we need to get the support of union and state governments in this regard, we need time to take up this transformation. Since we are awaiting the financial support of both Central and State governments and since the number to take the transition is large, we estimate that we would need 3 years to get them all to venture into deep sea and therefore these fishermen request permission to continue trawling till then. The Sri Lankan fishermen, during the dialogue, have been raising the question about the guarantee that the Indian fishermen will not venture into Sri Lankan waters after three years. By providing this assurance, the government of India can bring an amicable solution to this issue,? he said. ?
?
Kachchaithivu retrieval ?
?
The island was historically owned by the kings of Ramanathapuram kingdom, Tamil Nadu. However, in 1974, India handed over the abandoned island Kachchaithivu to Sri Lanka. The waters around the island are rich with fish and aquatic resources. Tamil Nadu fishermen have put many efforts to get back the gift given to Sri Lanka and the efforts have even reached Supreme Courts several times.?
The Chairperson of Alliance for Release of Innocent Fishermen (ARIF), Mr. Arulanandam, told the that they believe that the retrieval of Kachchaithivu would solve all the problems pertaining to both countries. ??
?This can be stopped only by taking back Kachchaithivu. If it was included in our territory, there is no need for our fishermen to cross over to Sri Lanka. ??
However, the Indian Central Government is still of the view that the gifts cannot be asked back. ?
?While many arrests are being made by both parties, the real point of the problem does not seem to be addressed, as both governments stay mute. Many politicians are willing to keep the problem unsolved, so that they can make use of it for their survival in politics,? he said. ?
The fishermen issue between Sri Lanka and India has been dragging on for several years, as both governments have failed to give a resolution despite having a number of discussion tables. However, not only Indian fishermen, but Sri Lankan fishermen ?too, are often arrested by the Indian Navy for poaching in Indian waters. Despite knowing it is illegal to trespass, their efforts for a good catch have not been reduced. ??
Sri Lanka Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amarasinghe had previously told the media that the total loss of income to Sri Lanka from poaching by Indian trawlers could amount to Indian Rupees 80 lakhs to 200 lakhs per day and Indian Rupees 300 crore ?to 700 crore per year. ??
It is not a surprise that the use of bottom trawlers has ruined the fish and aquatic resources of India. On the other hand, if the Indian fishermen?s constant arrival is not stopped by giving them a good solution compatible to both countries, the fate of India?s seabed will be the same for Sri Lanka?s Northern Province as well, depriving the livelihood of Sri Lankan fishermen in the area.
