Auditors go red on MP remarks
	
Sri Lanka Audit Service Association yesterday warned of tough action if the reports and queries of the Auditor General were continuously rebuked publicly, in an attempt to create a public opinion against the legitimacy and validity of them.
Recently, the Government MPs tried to rubbish the Auditor Generals reports on the Central Bank Bond sale, and the State borrowings in excess of the approved limit.
Also, Government MP Nalin Bandara Jayamaha, disputed an audit query regarding the coal transaction.
Commenting on the latest trend of disputing Auditor Generals reports, Association Chairman Nayana Kumara told the Daily Mirror that Auditors would keep an eye whether this would be done continuously.
He said such criticism would compromise legitimacy of the Auditor Generals queries and reports and erode public confidence in them.
If the trend continues, we will definitely take action. Otherwise, people will lose, he said.
Besides, he stressed the need to legislate on National Auditing by Parliament.
The Finance Minister has assured that the National Audit Bill would be presented in Parliament within the next fortnight. We wait till then, he said. (Kelum Bandara)

Jaffna Uni clash due to govt. negligence: Wimal
	
The government, which should be empowering the Tamil community, is instead allowing Tamil extremism to raise its head in the country, the joint opposition charged yesterday.
Referring to the Jaffna University clash which took place on Saturday, JO member and UPFA MP Wimal Weerawansa said the clash was a result of governments negligence.
The previous government continued the railway track to the North, renovated schools and implemented other projects to uplift the livelihood of the Tamil people. It seems we dont even have the reconciliation which we had before January 9, 2015, he told a media conference held in Colombo.
Commenting further on the university clash, he said it had started among two groups of students but later on a group of outsiders had entered the university and launched a selective attack on Sinhala students making them leave the premises.
Meanwhile, MP Udaya Gammanpila charged the media, NGOs and western countries which were vocal over the incidents of students clashes in the southern universities were keeping mum over the Jaffna University clash. Regardless of the faction, an offence should be considered as an offence, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Jana Satana Paada Yathrawa starts from Kandy on July 28
	
The five-day Jana Satana Paada Yathrawa organised by the Joint Opposition (JO) against alleged suppression by the government towards the people and the JO members will be launched from Kandy on July 28.
JO Leader and UPFA MP Dinesh Gunawardena said there were several causes which had led them to launch the Paada Yathrawa and said postponing of the local government elections, tax increase, signing of ETCA, curtailment of farmers relief, Constitutional trap and political witch hunt were among them.
It seems we need to constantly remind the government to be on track. Its we who launched protests against the former governor of the Central Bank forcing the government to appoint a new governor. Therefore, we will launch a peaceful walk against the governments suppression, he told a media briefing held in Colombo.
Meanwhile, outlining the Paada Yathrawas schedule and route, its organizing committee member MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage said the preparations for the walk would be start on July 27 evening from the Sri Dalada Maligawa after seeking blessings from the Most Ven. Mahanayake Theras.
He said the preparations will be held under the patronage of former president and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Paada Yathrawa would be launched in the morning of July 28 near the Queens Hotel, Kandy.
The second day of the Paada Yathrawa will be launched from Mawanella, the next day in Nelumdeniya followed by Nittambuwa on 31 and will reach Colombo on August 1, he said.
Recalling the court order on the JOs May Day processions location, JO Organiser MP Dullas Alahapperuma said they would not reveal the location where the final rally would be held until the last minute as a precautionary and a strategic measure.
He said the ministers were belittling attempts of the JO and its Paada Yathrawa saying the government could not be changed until the next general election in 2020. This is not so. The people of Brazil took it to the street against the government two months ago compelling the government to resign, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Prices of consumer items still high: Bandula
	
Displaying a kilogram packet of sugar at a news conference, UPFA member Bandula Gunawardane said today the prices of consumer items had not come down despite the controlled prices introduced by the government.
He said the price of a kilo of sugar was still Rs.100 though the government had fixed the price at Rs.95.
The government took an arbitrary decision to control the prices of 15 consumer goods to avoid the consequences of the VAT increase. But prices of goods had not come down yet, Mr. Gunawardena said.
He held the Prime Minister, Finance Minister and Trade Minister responsible for making the arbitrary decision though they had no authority to do so. He said it was the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) which had the authority to fix the retail prices.
Ministers act on their own. There is no proper management. For the first time since the July 1983 riots, shops were closed in Pettah in protest over tax increases,Mr. Gunawardena said.
He said the Government should reduce the taxes, stabilize the Sri Lankan rupee against the US dollar and reduce the budget deficit as measures to resolve the financial confusion.
Meanwhile, former MP G.L. Peiris said they were against the amendments to the VAT Bill and urged the government to withdraw the amendments. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Psychiatrists want Addiction to Internet classified as mental disorder
	
Karapitiya Teaching Hospital's Consultant Psychiatrist Dr. Ramani Ratnaweera said yesterday the worldwide medical specialists in psychiatry had urged that addiction to the internet be classified as a mental disorder.
She highlighted the fact that modern technology was an integral part of education in the world, but addiction to the internet could affect ones mental health.
Dr. Ratnaweera told the media that children were often subjected to stress when preparing for an examination and that it was the duty of parents and the teachers to create an atmosphere where they would be better able to face the challenges while avoiding the stress caused by competition.
However, it is unfortunate that the children are encouraged to use the internet as an integral part of their education. This has resulted in the children falling prey to internet-addiction which leads to mental disorders. It is an accepted fact that modern technology should be used for education, but it can bring about a negative effect with regard to their mental health. Addiction to the internet would cause irreparable damage to the cerebral nervous system just as in the case of addiction to narcotics and liquor. We have received evidence that many children use the internet, especially social websites even while neglecting their normal studies. They are bound to end up as victims of stress, mental and physical disorders including back pain and nervousness. Therefore, medical specialists all over the world have considered the inclusion of internet-addiction as a mental disorder, Dr. Ratnaweera said. (D. Sugathapala and Sumathipala Diyagahage)

SLFP ideas given to President today
	
The amendments proposed by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to be incorporated in the VAT Bill would be presented to President Maitripala Sirisena as party leader today, SLFP officials said yesterday.
While requesting to put the second reading and the passing of the VAT increase on hold until March 2017, the party yesterday said the Government would have to accept its proposals on the controversial tax, if the Government expected its support to enact it.
General Secretary of the UPFA-which is the SLFP-led political alliance-Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said the SLFPs proposals on VAT would be submitted to President Maithripala Sirisena today (19).
The SLFP Central Committee appointed a ministerial committee comprising Ministers Susil Premajayantha, Anura Priyadharshana Yapa, Mahinda Amaraweera and State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardana to discuss how to provide relief to the people, when the VAT increase is implemented, he said.
The Ministerial Committee has drafted a set of proposals on VAT increase and expects to submit it to President Sirisena tomorrow. The President Sirisena will discuss our proposals with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and arrive at a final decision.
Until then there will be no debate on VAT in Parliament. However, I believe that there will be some drastic changes to the original VAT proposals, Minister Amarawera said.
Minister Amaraweera said the SLFP did not dispute the Government position that the State revenue had to be increased to at least 20 percent of the GDP from the current 11 percent and the widely practiced way is to do it through increase of indirect tax.
But tax collection must not be an unbearable burden to the public and to the low income groups in particular. That is why the SLFP has proposed those amendments to the VAT Amendment Bill.
The Supreme Court on July 4 issued an interim order suspending the operation of VAT and NTB.
The order by a three judge bench Chaired by Chief Justice K. Sripavan would be effective until the final determination of the Apex Court on the petition filed against VAT or suitable amendments relating to the imposition of tax are passed in Parliament.
The Government had earlier decided to debate the VAT Amendment Bill tomorrow (20) and make the VAT increase from May 2 in conformity with the Supreme Court ruling.
The Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill will not be taken up for debate and enactment tomorrow as it has been challenged before the Supreme Court under Article 121(1) of the Constitution through a petition.
Initially, the Government had planned to enact it on that day.
Instead the Bill on Regulations Under the Sports Law will be taken up for debate in the Parliament on 20 July 2016. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
