SLC sack U19 manager ahead of World Cup
	
In an unprecedented move, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) yesterday sacked Under 19 team manager Shane Fernando just three days ahead of the team?s schedule departure to the U19 World Cup in Bangladesh.
The Youth World Cup will be held from February 27 to March 14 in India with the participation of 16 teams, including seven associate teams.
Fernando has been replaced with chief junior selector Ranjith Madurusinghe who will act as the selector cum manager during the all important tour.
Fernando, a former SSC cricketer, was appointed as manager of the U19 team till the World Cup in Bangladesh in January 1, 2015 but the new cricket administrators have felt he was not good enough to hold the position during the World Cup.
?Since we have Madurasinghe touring with the team, the Executive Committee decided to give him the manager?s responsibility as well,? said Mohan de Silva, Secretary of SLC
However Daily Mirror reliably learns that the Ex-Co decided to remove Fernando as he had openly supported the Ranatunga camp during the recent Sri Lanka Cricket election.
Fernando was a close associate of the Ranatungas having played under Arjuna for SSC and also had a brief stint as Media Manager when Arjuna led the SLC as interim head in 2008.
However, Fernando will join the team as assistant manager, in charge of team?s logistics.
Meanwhile, SLC is likely to remove Vanessa De Silva as manager of the national women?s team for the forthcoming India tour. Vanessa is the Manager Women?s Cricket, overlooking all affairs of women?s cricket at SLC, and the new cricket administrators believe a paid employee should not be appointed to any other paid position within the system. Her name was recommended by the interim committee whose term ended on January 3.
?There are number of changes we have mooted in every sphere at Sri Lanka Cricket. It?s too early to comment on this matter since there?s time for the tour,? de Silva added.(Champika Fernando)

GL says Govt. bankrupt
	
The move by the Finance Ministry to get hold of 1 billion USDs from a ?mystery? investor to defend Sri Lankan rupee was not acceptable in anyway and reflected the degree of desperation of the government as well as its bankruptcy, the Joint Opposition said today.
The expert on these matters for the Joint Opposition G.L. Peiris said the move was not only detrimental to the economy, but also would put the national security of the country at risk.
?The Ministry is withholding the identity of the investor and Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake says that they are not concerned how the funds the investor is investing had been earned.
?These funds could be black money, drug money or funds collected by terrorists. External forces could invade our economic nerve centres by investing in them,? he told a news conference held at the Dr. N.M. Perera Centre in Borella.
He said the 500 USD million had been sent to the government by the investor already in December and the rest of the funds were to be received later this month.
He said one of the funds remitting bank is in Belgium and the other in Luxemburg.
He said the Finance Minister?s call that anyone can go to the courts if they have doubts with regard to the nature of funds was absurd.
?The government has no regulation over these funds. It is blatantly showing the world how bankrupt the government is. This move will only tarnish the image of the country,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Behaviour of cricketers: No comments, says Manager
	
Sri Lanka Cricket team manager Jerry Woutersz refused to comment on reports of misconduct and indiscipline by members of the national cricket team during the recent New Zealand tour but said a report would be handed over to the Minister within the next few days.
"I am not admitting or denying anything. But I have been asked to submit a report which I will do during the next few days," he said at a press conference held at the Sri Lanka Cricket this afternoon.
Sri Lanka suffered an embarrassing series defeat--Test 2-0, ODIs 3-1, T20 2-0 during the tour.
Meanwhile, speaking at the press conference, Sri Lanka?s interim coach Jerome Jayaratne called for a complete overhaul of the domestic cricket structure to meet the demand of international cricket.
Mr. Jayaratne, who will soon be replaced with a permanent coach, said that the biggest problem he sees is the gap between domestic and international cricket.
?We didn?t lose the series deliberately. We have a very good bunch of talented cricketers but their standards are much lower than what we see in international cricket. We need to bridge that gap by revamping our domestic cricket and making it much more professional. It should be played like international cricket,? said Jayaratne.
?If you see the cricketers who come through the Australian, English, South African or New Zealand system, they can very easily adjust to international cricket but our players find it hard. You don?t come to the national team to gain experience but to perform but our cricketers come there to learn because our domestic structure is not strong,? he explained.
Jayaratne who was the head of cricket coaching since 2007 was appointed interim coach in September when Marvan Atapattu resigned following two back to back home defeats against Pakistan and India.
He said Sri Lanka needs to address this urgently.
?You learn your cricket at the domestic level not at the international level. There?s big issue with our domestic structure and we need to address it urgently,? he added.
Many have suggested a radical change of the country?s domestic structure, including retired greats like Mahela Jayawardana and Kumar Sangakkara, in order to bridge the ever-widening gap but successive cricket administrations have paid too little attention.
In 2011, former Sri Lanka cricketer Sidath Wettimuny put a paper outlining the value of pushing provincial cricket over club cricket, an idea which he tried to implement during his short eight-months as interim head in 2015.
However the new cricket administrators headed by Thilanga Sumathipala had vowed to revamp the domestic structure in order to raise lift the standards.
Sri Lankan cricketers have been through a lean patch since the 2015 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, losing all series except the West Indies series at home.
?I guess if they had that experience and exposure, we would have done better in New Zealand. We lost the first test but we were ahead of New Zealand in the second test but they just could not finish it off. This is where the experience comes in," Jayaratne said.
On a separate note Jayaratne believe Sri Lanka should get its combinations right going into defend the World T20 title in March.
?I can?t say we have the best team at the moment. We have a number of positions which need to be sorted out. For instance, there?s a cricketer at SSC who has been consistently scoring runs, so there?s a very good chance of him coming into the side,? he added.
Meanwhile Test and ODI skipper Angelo Mathews and T20 skipper Dinesh Chandimal apologized for the poor showing in New Zealand.
?We did everything possible but nothing really worked for us. We are sorry,? the duo said. (Champika Fernando)

Ninety housemaids who were provided alternative shelter by the Sri Lankan High Commission in Kuwait arrived at the Bandaranaike International Airport today.

During a visit to Kuwait last year, Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala had met all the housemaids staying at the safe houses and assured them that her ministry would help bring them back to the country even though some of them were not registered with the Bureau.
The FEB said more than 300 housemaids were still living in safe houses in Kuwait.
However, Minister Athukorala said she would take necessary measures to bring them back to the country.
?Thrity six of the housemaids did not even have money to return home. The FEB had provided them the money and helped them to contact their families as well,? an official said. (Piyumi Fonseka)

If it does not get 2/3 majority the process will fail
	
	The resolution to convert Parliament into a Constitutional Assembly had not received cabinet approval and if it failed to secure a two-thirds majority in Parliament, due to a lack of consensus among the political parties, the entire process would fail, said Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faizer Mustapha.
	He said Parliament had not taken a decision on the day the vote was to be taken, and Parliament was adjourned till January 26 for further discussion of the resolution. However, party leaders would decide on the day of voting after considering the amendments or proposals, if any, by the other political parties, he said.
	He told the media yesterday that consensus has been reached only between the major political parties in the government -- the UNP and SLFP -- with the UNP agreeing to the nine amendments proposed by the SLFP.
	He said there was some harmony between the two major parties in the government; but the other parties, such as the JVP, TNA and MEP were yet to submit their proposals or amendments.
	For instance, the nine amendments presented by the SLFP did not affect the main Constitutional provisions but only the procedures to be adopted in drafting the Constitutional Amendments or a new Constitution. The resolutions presented by the Prime Minister did not touch on the Constitutional provisions either, he said.
	Mr. Mustapha said if and when the Constitutional Assembly was approved by Parliament with a two-thirds majority, it would draft the Constitution or Amendments to the Constitution under the provisions of the 1978 Constitution -- after an across-the-board discussion with all stakeholders, including political parties, civil society, academia, the public and the minorities.
	Commenting on the hypothetical weaknesses in the proposed Constitution, he said the Constitutional reforms would have to be first approved in parliament with a two-thirds majority and then approved at a referendum. Therefore, there will be nothing to hide and the entire process will be transparent and open to scrutiny by every citizen contrary to the allegations of a few disgruntled MPs in the opposition, he said.
	He said bankrupt politicians should not attempt to cause fear in the minds of the people by talking of a ?Constitutional Demon? to gain political advantage.
	He said, for instance, Prof. G.L.Peiris, who drafted a new Constitution in 2005, as the Constitutional Affairs Minister in the Chandrika Kumaratunga government, did not refer to a unitary state of Sri Lanka but only a republic consisting of regions. e Minister did not touch on the Constitutional provisions either, he said.

	At a meeting with the Jaffna Fishermen Association, the Minister said there would be a drastic increase in the number of Indian fishermen arrested after the Thaipongal Festival. ?
	The decision was made as Sri Lankans could not make a livelihood in Northern waters, even though the civil war had ended, as Indian fishermen continued to engage in illegal bottom trawling in Sri Lankan waters.
	He assured the Ministry would request the Navy and Coast Guard to seize more than 500 trawlers, a fraction of the trawlers illegally entering Sri Lankan waters daily, before the end of the year.
	?Bottom trawling not only effects the local fishermen it also destroys the marine resources of the country. I have informed the Indian Central Government and Indian High Commission regarding the issue and they are aware of the situation,? he said.
	Minister Amaraweera said the Sri Lankan government would not release the trawlers and fishing equipment that will be confiscated.

Vehicle prices will go further up, say importers
	
	Following the new budget proposals taxes on vehicles would increase by 20 percent, the Chairman of Lanka Vehicle Importers' Association Mahinda Sarathchandra said today.
	?This will include the condition of the vehicle as well,? he said.
	?The tax would be increased with the addition of Customs Valuation, which increased on November 18, 2015; Customs Duty, which increased on November 20, 2015 and the currency rate fluctuation,? he said.
	Because of the price increase the imports would be limited, he said.
	He also urged prospective buyers to buy from the existing stocks as they hoped to sell them based on the old tax regime.
	He said on average the price of a vehicle could increase by Rs. 500,000 following the budget.
	?As an association, we expected a tax relief from the government for the release of the imported vehicles from the Customs. But the government suddenly issued a statement through the Finance Ministry to release motor vehicles imported by individuals for personal use on Letters of Credit opened before the effective date of the 2016 budget,? Sarathchandra said.
	?Even President Maithripala Sirisena had instructed to reduce the tax on electric cars by 5 percent after the budget proposal, this also is applicable to individual imports,? he said.
	?The tax deduction was imposed on the individual importers, who opened the Letters of Credits (LCs) on or before the budget 2016. People?s aspiration of owning an electric car has now become a pipe dream with the Finance Ministry?s Statement.
	?Motor vehicles should have been imported and registered on or before March 31 in the name of the importer under whose name the LC was opened and shall not be transferred for a period of five years from the date of registration without prior approval from the General Treasury,? the statement issued by the Finance Ministry said.
	He said about Rs.70,000 would have to be paid in demurrages for each vehicle, which had landed at the Hambantota Port about two months ago.
	He urged Finance Minister to review the issue and implement a systematic way to implement such increases, so that importers and customers were not affected. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
