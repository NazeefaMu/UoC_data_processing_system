Enhanced living comforts cost Rs.15 million
	

A yahapalanaya purohita has utilized Rs.15 million from the funds of a state-owned corporation coming under his Ministry to renovate his official residence.

This official residence located at Gregorys Road in Colombo belongs to the Ministry of Public Administration. However, there are three official quarters belonging to the corporation at Sarana Road and two of them are being currently occupied by a Deputy General of the corporation and an additional secretary of the Ministry in question. 
The security personnel of this loss making corporation themselves have been deployed to provide security to this official residence now being given a new look.
We cannot understand why on earth the Ministry is using the funds of the loss making corporation to renovate a building belonging to another Ministry when it can channel these monies into putting up an additional official residence for the corporation itself. Isnt it common sense, a corporation employee asked.
By the way, the purohita seems to have forgotten that he will have to vacate this official residence renovated at a massive expense if he loses at the next general polls.

## Title: Fitch affirms Ceylon Dollar Bond Fund at BB-/ V5
## Section: Financial News

Fitch affirms Ceylon Dollar Bond Fund at BB-/ V5
	
Fitch Ratings has affirmed Ceylon Dollar Bond Funds Fund Credit Quality Rating of BB- and affirmed the Fund Volatility Rating at V5. The fund is managed by Ceylon Asset Management (CAM).
The affirmation of the BB- Fund Credit Quality Rating is driven by the weighted average rating factor (WARF) and rating distribution based on the expected composition of the fund and the funds investment guidelines. The fund has a limited investment space as it will only invest in US dollar bonds issued by the government of Sri Lanka, licensed banks in Sri Lanka and Sri Lankan corporates that are rated by an international rating agency. This limits the potential investments to 13 issuances totalling just under US$ 9 billion.
The affirmation of the Fund Volatility Rating is driven by the reduced exposure to interest-rate risk and spread risk, while recognising the funds ability to extend duration risk to a greater level than that expressed in the target portfolio. The rating is also affirmed because the target portfolio is not yet fully invested and its ultimate composition remains uncertain, and due to Fitchs conservative assumptions relating to potential volatility in emerging market debt.
The funds updated target portfolio comprises of four bonds - three rated BB- and one rated B+ which have been issued by the entities detailed above. The target portfolio is mainly exposed either directly to government or government-guaranteed debt. The fund will invest up to 4 percent of its assets in US-dollar fixed deposits in a licensed commercial bank in Sri Lanka.
By 17 February 2016, the fund had invested in three of the four issuances in the target portfolio (representing 73.4 percent of the portfolio). The rest of the funds are placed in US dollar deposits with Deutsche Bank Sri Lanka, a branch of Deutsche Bank AG (A-/Stable/F1+). The fund has struggled to reach a substantial size since its launch in July 2014, partly due to volatility in overall market conditions.
The target portfolio will be concentrated with material exposure to Sri Lankan sovereign risk.
The concentration risk is a structural feature given the limited opportunities in the funds investment universe. Fitch has conducted stress tests on the target portfolio. Based on its analysis, Fitch believes the fund has a limited capacity to withstand negative rating migration in its investments before it would be downgraded to the B category.
The updated target portfolio has a shorter weighted average life (WAL) than the original model portfolio based on which we assigned the ratings in July 2014. As a result, the target portfolio has a significantly lower sensitivity to interest-rate risk and spread risk than the original model portfolio. Based on the funds market risk factor alone, it could achieve a V4 Fund Volatility Rating. However, in affirming the rating at V5, Fitch has taken into consideration the fact that the fund is not yet fully invested so its eventual composition may differ from that of the target portfolio, and that the fund manager does have discretion to extend duration above current levels if it sees fit.
Fitch has also taken wider market conditions- notably potential volatility in emerging market debt - into consideration in its rating decision. According to Fitchs criteria, funds rated V5 are considered to have high sensitivity to market risk. On a relative basis, total returns and/or changes in net asset value are likely to experience substantial variability across a range of market scenarios due to substantial exposure to interest rates, credit spreads and other risk factors. The fund will invest in instruments with a relatively long maturity (WAL of 2.52 years in the target portfolio) except for an allocation of up to 4 percent to three-month deposits. Therefore the fund will be reliant on secondary market liquidity to meet large redemption requests. However, the fund has access to an overdraft facility of 10 percent, and requires 14 days notice on redemptions above 3 percent of the fund. On the asset side, it will hold only a limited proportion of outstanding debt issues, all of which will be listed on the Singapore Exchange.
The fund is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka under the Unit Trust Code, 2011. The funds trustee is Deutsche Bank Sri Lanka.
Fitch considers CAM suitably qualified, competent and capable of managing the fund. The investment committee has relevant experience, and the company has sufficient sources of information on which to base its decision-making process.
Fitch considers the systems supporting the funds investment activities to be satisfactory. CAM is 21 percent-owned by Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Limited (SLIC, BB-/Stable), 69 percent by Ceylon Capital Trust (Pvt) Ltd and 10 percent by Commercial Credit and Finance PLC (CCF). Fitch believes CAM has support from the shareholders. However, a key challenge facing the business will be to demonstrate sustained growth in assets under management. The Ceylon Dollar Bond Fund is a key component of its growth strategy. CAM has been managing funds since 1999.
The current management team has been in place since 2005, and SLIC and CCF invested in the business in 2010 and 2013, respectively.

Gangaramaya Prelate advises PM, MR
	
Hunupitiya Gangaramaya Temple's Chief incumbent Ven. Galaboda Gnanissara Thera yesterday called for the end of confrontational politics in Sri Lanka and gave a piece of advice to both Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to work towards the betterment of the country.
This government has brought the country close to embarking on a fruitful journey towards development and I like to tell Mr. Rajapaksa not to sabotage the governments activities ( Me Rajaya Rata Honda Gamanak yana thenakata genath thiyanawa. Mahinda Rajapaksa manthrithumani Kakulen Adinna Epa), the Thera told the former President and Kurunegala District MP who was present at the opening ceremony of the Navam Perahera of the Gangarama Temple last evening.
The prelate also told Prime Minister Wickremesinghe that one should not lose his temper. Dont lose your cool as you can be aggressive. DO so only when the need arises ( Kenthi ganna epa, awashya welawata pamanak kenthi ganna) he told the Prime Minister.
Prime Minister is accused of being aggressive towards mass media these days and one has to be aggressive towards the media. The rulers of the country have the right to be aggressive towards media, he added.
Going back down memory lane, the prelate recalled how he hoisted black flags when the Indian Peace Keeping Force ( IPKF) was brought to Sri Lanka and how Prime Minister Wickremesinghe cautioned him not to say anything which upset the then President J R Jayewardene.
He also said a former SLFP government took over the Lake House of the Wijewardene family and requested the Prime Minister to make Lake House an independent venture and hand it over to the Wijewardene family as it was their heritage. Incidentally this appeal came on the eve of the 130th birth anniversary of the late press baron D. R. Wijewardene who founded Lake House.
The Thera thanked the Wijewardene and Wickremesinghe families and the governments of the past and present for their roles in developing the Gangarama Temple and the Jinaratana vocational training center.
The prelate also said the disunity among the Sinhalese made them lose their right to rule this country and this helped the British to take over this country. He therefore recalled that Kandasamy was crowned as a result of disunity among the Sinhala rulers. (Yohan Perera)

GMOA sceptical about India-aided ambulance service
	
The governments decision to set up an Indian run ambulance service was heavily criticized by the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today (23).
The GMOA questioned why a cabinet paper seeking approval for the setting up of an Indian ambulance service was not presented by the Minister of Health, Rajitha Senaratne.
Speaking at a media conference, GMOA Secretary Dr. Nalinda Herath said when the country already had plenty of ambulance services run by the government, private companies and non-governmental organizations, a feasibility study by the government should have been launched on the necessity of bringing in another Emergency Ambulance Service.
He alleged that Indian personnel will flow into Sri Lanka with the implementation of India-aided Emergency Ambulance handled by the Hyderabad-based GVK Emergency Management and Research Institute (GVK-EMRI) in the Southern and Western parts of the country. The government said the health sector would not be affected by the proposed ETCA. Meanwhile, they had decided to set up an Indian run ambulance service which will be employing only Indians, and not Lankans, according to the agreement, he said.
If the new ambulance service is that essential, our government should only procure the ambulances from them, so that qualified Lankan health workers can be employed in the service. All the opportunities for locals to apply for jobs in the so-called ambulance service have been restricted, he charged.
They questioned whether the ambulance service was a life-saving emergency service consisting of information technology equipment, communication facilities and police service or simply a transport service from one hospital to the other.
The GMOA said the ambulance service would be a threat to national security because all the information of citizens living in the Western and Southern Provinces could be gathered by the Indian government through the proposed ambulance service. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Harsha rejects GMOA allegations
	
Rejecting the allegations by the GMOA on governments decision to set up an ambulance service operated by an Indian organisation, Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Harsha de Silva said today
that it would not pose a threat to national security as alleged by the GMOA and would instead be beneficial to the people.
Dr. De Silva said no one would object to such a meritorious act, which would be of immense help to the people who have to die in three-wheelers or on the road without proper transport facilities to rush to hospital in an emergency.
Responding to the allegation that Indian personnel would flow into Sri Lanka with the implementation of the India-aided emergency ambulance service handled by the Hyderabad-based GVK Emergency Management and Research Institute (GVK-EMRI), Dr. De Silva said only Sri Lankans would be employed apart from three to four Indians involved in technology transfer.
Dr. De Silva said the ambulance service would be operated by GVK-EMRI for the first year and, after that, the government would decide whether to take it over or allow the company to continue running it.
Dr. De Silva said this move would be beneficial to the ordinary people as it would be free of charge and would reach the patient within 20 minutes -- with a doctor on board. (Ajith Siriwardana)

HNB Al Najah opens first Islamic Banking Unit in Pettah
	
Hatton National Bank (HNB) Islamic Banking has opened its second Unit at Pettah, as a key step in a rapid expansion drive of its Islamic banking operations.
The new unit was ceremonially declared open in the presence of the Chief Guest HNB Managing Director/CEO Jonathan Alles, members of corporate management and special invitees. Addressing the gathering, HNB Managing Director/CEO Jonathan Alles spoke about the significance of the new unit.
The establishment of this unit in Pettah is extremely important to us. As it is situated on the bustling Main Street, it will cater to the financial needs of thousands of customers who visit the area for business and shopping purposes daily. Through this new unit we will also be able to offer an alternative to the conventional banking which has been available to Pettah customers for over 40 years, and to provide a privileged service to the proprietors and partners of businesses.
The new unit reinforces HNBs standing as an inclusive bank which touches the lives of all communities, and will cater to the entire retail, SME and corporate customer segments of HNB. Islamic Banking under the Al Najah brand is an alternative banking system which is available to all customers, irrespective of their faith and religious beliefs.
Alles went on to speak about Al Najah, the Islamic banking brand of HNB.
Al Najah has grown exponentially over the past four years, as we have aggressively targeted this segment and pursued transactions. During 2016 we hope to expand in to at least another two regions. This will take Sharia compliant banking services to customers doorsteps and open up many exciting possibilities for Al Najah. Apart from this, we have taken other steps to develop the brand. While carrying out many transactions locally, last year for the first time we backed a project overseas which was 100% Islamic. Currently, we are also looking at funding structures from some of our development finance or banking partners overseas as well. All this will augment growth under the Al Najah Islamic banking vertical.
HNB Al Najah was established in February 2012 with a view to elevating Islamic banking in Sri Lanka to new heights.

Australian Immigration Minister Peter Dutton has admitted that Australian border protection authorities recently turned an asylum seeker boat back to Sri Lanka, 9news Australia reported on Tuesday.
Mr. Dutton had given few details beyond saying this occurred in the last couple of weeks.
"We determined that those people aren't refugees and then they go back to their country of origin. We have a good relationship with Sri Lanka as we do with Indonesia," he told Brisbane radio 4BC.
He said just because boat arrivals weren't making the news each night didn't mean the threat had gone away. "We are dealing with possible ventures regularly," he said.
Mr. Dutton said there were 14,000 people waiting in Indonesia to get on boats to Australia if people smugglers saw any relaxation in the current tough policy.
"There are many millions more potentially who would want to get into Europe but can't, and would be happy to make their way up through Malaysia into Indonesia onto boats to come to our country," he said.
Mr. Dutton said 1,200 people drowned under Labor and people would drown again if people smugglers started risking lives on leaky boats.

He told a media briefing held in Colombo, that there was no one strong enough to object to Mr. Wickremesinghes statement asking the media to toe the line.
He said in 1982, when former president Ranasinghe Premadasa criticized a certain print media institution, all the media institutions stood against it.
Unfortunately at present the situation is different. When one media institution gets criticized, others keep quiet because they do not want to get involved in it, Mr. Gammanpila said.(Darshana Sanjeewa and Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Port City Project -- Govt. proposes amendments
	
The Government has more or less given the green light for the Colombo Port City Project, but with the original agreement amended with a reduction on the land extent to be reclaimed from the sea and without any part of this area granted on a freehold basis, a minister said yesterday.
The original agreement, signed by the previous regime, sought to reclaim 233 hectares from the sea adjoining the Colombo Port. The Chinese company, investing in the US$1.4 billion project, was to retain 108 hectares including 20 hectares on a freehold basis with the rest on a 99-year lease while the rest was to be vested with Sri Lanka.
However, the new Sri Lankan Government is working out amendments to the original agreement.
Ahead of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes visit to China on April, 6, Strategic Development Minister Malik Samarawickrama and Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake will visit China on February 29.
Mr. Samarawickrama said he would discuss a host of matters including the Port City Project and the setting up of an economic zone in Hambantota with an investment by a Chinese company.
The Prime Minister had on an earlier occasion said a Chinese company had sought 1,000 acres of land in the area for a ship building project.
When asked about the Colombo Port City Project, he said, We will discuss how we are going to proceed with that.
Asserting that the government has agreed, more or less, to move ahead with the project, he said the original agreement was needed to be amended.
We are not too keen on offering any reclaimed land to China on a freehold basis. We also intend reducing the extent of land to be reclaimed so that the project is environmentally firendly, the Prime Minister said.
We are discussing all these sticking points and need to finalize them, he said when asked whether China was agreeable to any change.
The project was inked by the previous regime in 2014 and was launched at a function attended by Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, the current government suspended the project citing several irregularities. According to the China communication Construction Company, the suspension had caused a daily loss of US$380,000.

UNP will win LG polls regardless of symbol: Jayamaha
	
The United National Party (UNP) is confident of winning the upcoming local government elections even if it contests under a symbol other than that of the elephant, Partys Kurunegala District parliamentarian Nalin Bandara Jayamaha assured yesterday.
He dismissed the claims made by the opposition that the local government elections were being postponed because ruling party was afraid of losing and said the UNP would win even if it contested under the elephant's tail as a symbol.
Mr. Jayamaha said the local government elections were being delayed because the Government was keen to conduct the elections under the new electoral system which requires the demarcation of wards.
He lauded joint opposition MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena for having participated at the recently held workshop on oversight committees.
Mr. Jayamaha said former president Rajapaksa is engaged in attempts at pressuring President Maitripala Sirisena saying a new party would be formed by him as a means of escaping from the corruption allegations against him and his family.
Referring to the proposed Economic and Technological Cooperation Agreement with India he said it would be presented to Parliament before it was signed. (Yohan Perera)
