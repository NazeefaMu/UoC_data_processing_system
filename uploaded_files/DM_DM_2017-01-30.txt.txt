## Title: CIA had if Rajiv was assassinated report

CIA had if Rajiv was assassinated report
	
Five years before Rajiv Gandhi was killed in 1991, the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had prepared a very detailed and thorough "brief" on what would happen if he is assassinated or makes an "abrupt departure" from the Indian political scene, the Times of India said yesterday.
A 23-page report, titled "India After Rajiv ..." was put out as early as in March 1986 for comments from other senior CIA officials. The "sanitised" report was declassified recently by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
The report, whose complete title is not entirely available as it is part deleted, was prepared on the basis of inputs available to the CIA till January 1986.
The very first sentence of the report's available (undeleted) page reads: "Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi faces at least an even chance of assassination before his tenure in office ends in 1989." It, however, later clearly said that "assassination is the major near-term threat" to him.
Over five years later, Gandhi was assassinated at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu on May 21, 1991 by the LTTE.
The first section titled "Key Judgments" analyses and deliberates upon what likely scenario would emerge in the domestic and international political situation if there is a sudden change in leadership minus Rajiv Gandhi and the likely impact on India's relations with the US, the then USSR and the region.
It also dealt with the threats posed to Gandhi's life by various extremist groups at that time and the likely fallout of his murder.
"If Gandhi fell to a Sikh or Kashmiri Muslim assassin, widespread communal violence probably would erupt even if strong preventive security measures - including deployment of Army and paramilitary troops across northern India - were taken by the Indian President ......(deleted)," it said.
Interestingly, it also names P. V. Narasimha Rao and V. P. Singh, who could be the "interim successor" and "likely candidates" in case of sudden exit by Rajiv. Rao took over as the Prime Minister in 1991.
In a section, titled 'The Threat of Assassination: Stability in Jeopardy', the report says "In our view, there is at least an even chance in the next several years of an assassination, most likely by extremist Sikhs or disgruntled Kashmiri Muslims who have targeted Rajiv," besides "a fanatical Hindu".
Since a significant portion of this section is deleted, it is not clear whether Sri Lankan Tamil extremists were also dealt with in the analysis. However, another section deals in- depth with Rajiv's mediation efforts to resolve "the conflict between militant Sri Lankan Tamils and the Sinhalese-dominated government in Colombo..."
Besides Gandhi's possible assassination, the report also analysed various scenarios of his "abrupt departure" from the political scene before 1989.
"Although we believe assassination is the major near-term threat to Rajiv's tenure, any of several other events could cause his abrupt departure from the political scene before 1989," it said while listing out several other possibilities including "his death from natural causes or by accident".
It ruled out the possibility of a decision by him "to resign out of frustration", saying "we see no signs of this and believe it would be out of character".
The CIA report also noted: "We suspect, however, that Rajiv would calculate -- as we do -- that he and his kin would be targets for extremist violence even if he left public office."
In a section called "Implications for the United States", the report says "We believe (Rajiv) Gandhi's death would represent a significant blow to US interests, regardless of the circumstances of the succession."
"...We believe Indo-US relations could also suffer as a result of domestic political changes following Rajiv's assassination."
The report assessed Rajiv's policies ranging from dealing with extremists, foreign relations (including Sri Lankan Tamil issue) to promoting acquisition of selected foreign technology" among others, and their outcome.
"Although some of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's policies will continue to encounter serious resistance over the next several years, we believe his dominance of the Indian political scene is secure until at least the end of his present term of office in December 1989, barring his incapacitation or death," it said.
The report also dealt with the possibility of a "national government" taking over in case of a sudden exit by Rajiv, while discounting the possibility of a military coup in such a scenario.
Several portions of the 23-page report had been deleted before the CIA decided to release it under the Freedom of Information Act.

Citigroup quietly launches small business lending website
	
REUTERS: Citigroup Inc has quietly launched a website to make small business loans of up to US $1 million, the latest effort by a big bank to make the process of smaller loans more technology-friendly.
Citigroups online toe in the water comes after similar moves by several other banks. For example, JPMorgan Chase & Co announced a partnership with online lender On Deck Capital Inc in December 2015 and Wells Fargo & Co launched a fast-decision online small business loan product some eight months ago.
Banks have been cautious about entering the online lending space despite the proliferation of online non-bank lenders such as On Deck, LendingClub Corp Prosper Marketplace and other startups. Early optimism about prospects for such companies soured after LendingClubs CEO resigned over a loan-selling scandal.
Citigroups website is run by Biz2Credit, a New York-based startup. Borrowers visiting the Citigroup website are directed to a separate website run by Biz2Credit where they fill out an online worksheet before following up with a Citigroup small business banker.
Biz2Credit CEO Rohit Arora said being online makes it easier for Citigroup to fulfill its obligations to small and underserved borrowers under the Community Reinvestment Act because it allows access for customers who live far from a branch.
Citigroup and Biz2Credit chose not to publicize the effort because it is still in very early stages, Arora said.
If you make a premature announcement the expectations go very high and then youre in the public eye all the time, he said.
A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment.

UK, (Daily Mail, London), 28 January 2017- Finishing other peoples sentences, cracking your knuckles and biting your toenails all feature in a chart of Britons worst habits. 
More than 90 per cent admit to having at least one bad habit, with one in 10 admitting to 10 or more weaknesses. 
Swearing was the most common bad trait, followed by nose-picking, not listening when others are speaking and biting your nails.But more immediately, something as seemingly insignificant as not washing your hands or biting your nails often can lead to a cold or bug, or even pass your germs on to an unsuspecting stranger or loved one.

Decriminalize sexual orientations  in HOMO-sapiens
	
To criminalise homosexuality or treat a segment of our society as criminals for something beyond their control is a worst crime.Sexual Orientations in humans should be decriminalized as a first step towards future legalizing of same-sex marriage. 
A businessman, who owned a large fleet of boats in the fishing village in the western coast in early 20th century, was under pressure from his ailing mother, had married a beautiful young damsel from the adjoining village and settled down in his newly-built house following a week-long ceremony [hath-dhaa magula]. The well-to-do middle-aged man who never visited the main bed room would drive his brand new Baby Austin car with a X number by himself leaving his young and good-looking driver at home. The young man was paid handsomely as he was committed to serve the householders in fulfilling all their desires. The very understanding threesome was in a love triangle, and had lived happily ever-after with the six children who addressed the driver Bappa (paternal uncle).
A harmless private arrangement by the family, - does it sound criminal We generally hate to adapt to anything new that makes us feel uncomfortable! 

"Some pundits think the gay people need psychiatric treatment to change sexual orientation. Researchers have found that homosexuality is a normal deviation in sexuality and does not cause any negative psychological effects"
Ignorance of third gender
Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, more famously known by its acronym GLAAD, the American organization advises the media to use the term - gay - a word originally clinched by homosexuals as a positive expression instead of the term homosexual. As Daily Mirror reported a few days ago, the Cabinet have rejected surreptitious attempts by some to decriminalize homosexuality. 
President Maithipala Sirisena, the conservative personality who chaired the session no doubt would have found himself in a somewhat embarrassing position being hesitant to look straight in the eyes of some senior and junior members when the matter came up for discussion. To be fair by one senior minister, he had already and openly divulged his inclinations when he declared a year ago. 
My private life is no secret 
However, as cabinet spokesmen and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne, put it at his weekly media briefing, anybody is free to practise the artbut the government does not want to establish the phenomenon as officially decriminalized unlike in some European States he said. Though he quoted religious and cultural reasons for the decision, the minister being a hetero-sexual did not know that our giant neighbour had already decriminalized the act through Lokh Sabha a decade ago. We are not attempting to guess who is supporting the tradition in the Cabinet, we have to appreciate that there are diverse sexual orientations among the animal kingdom that includes humans as well. They no longer are considered unnatural and the practitioners should not be persecuted for their sexual desire. After all, every man and woman has the right to be free. 
Religious vs scientific views
A few religious people believe that homosexuality is unnatural but scientists differ; they have found more than 600 species in the animal world who practise same sex engagement. Some pundits think the gay people need psychiatric treatment to change sexual orientation. Researchers have found that homosexuality is a normal deviation in sexuality and does not cause any negative psychological effects. Discrimination by heterosexists has caused homophobia in many gay or lesbian people not to identify as gay or lesbian, therefore the ratio of people who have same-sex sexual experiences are hard for statisticians to estimate reliably. 
The colonial rulers from Europe are responsible for spreading anti-gay stances in Asia and Africa. Existence of a third gender has been a scientifically proved fact; recognition and provision of rights due to them is our foremost duty. Homosexuality is a lifestyle, there should be no social stigma associated with it. Buddhism and other eastern religions have no issue with gays/lesbians. It is the politician who lacks knowledge in Dhamma who say it is against Buddhism. 
Gays in ancient Greece and pre-historic era: Socrates and Pinguttara
Homosexuality in 5th and 4th century Greece was almost an essential part of social life. As for Socrates, if we look at the writings about him, though he was married and had children, he had engaged in sex with men as well, because that was usual for a man in that point in time and place to practise pederasty. Pederasty -- is a homosexual relationship between a grown up male and a boy which was relatively well accepted and widespread act in ancient Athens. 
Most men in ancient Greece seemed to have been more interested in having sexual relations with young men  some of the early philosophers seemed to meticulously work and talk about homosexuality, and Socrates, known as a great philosopher, even portrayed himself as being experienced in the pursuit of men. The dialogues of Plato  a student of Socrates wrote, - pederasty and homosexuality had been a part of everyday life, mainly for aristocrats. 


"Homosexuality is a lifestyle, there should be no social stigma associated with it. Buddhism and other eastern religions have no issue with gays/lesbians. It is the politician who lacks knowledge in Dhamma who say it is against Buddhism"

Siri Kaalakanni Prassnaya is an episode narrated under Ummagga, in the Tales of Buddhas past births, or the Jataka Potha. As the story goes, a youth named Pinguttara, having gone to Taxila, studied under Disapamok, and soon mastered them. Returning all the books, he said to the teacher, I shall now bid you good bye 
Now there was a custom that obtained in the family of the teacher that if he should have a daughter who had attained womanhood, she must be given to his best pupil. This teacher had a daughter as beautiful as a goddess, and he told the youth, My son, I shall give you Udumbara, my daughter, and you may take her away. 
The sight of this maiden did not excite the youngster. He thought, I will not disregard the words of my master, and so accepted the arrangement. At night the youth got into the prepared bed and laid him down to sleep. As soon as the young lady followed him to bed he got down from it, grumbling, and lay himself down on the ground. Young Udumbara then got down from the bed herself and went towards Pinguttara, when he again rose up and got on to the bed. The bride followed too; and the youth once more got down from it. The damsel therefore remained in bed while the dejected man slept on the floor. After seven days, he took leave of him and set out on the journey homewards with the bride, although he bore no love towards her. On their way, no words exchanged between them. Pinguttara, who was very hungry, saw a dimbul-tree laden with fruit, so he climbed up and began to eat them. Udumbara, also being very hungry, said, Give me also some fruit. Why, have you no hands and feet Climb up the tree and eat them,he said.
As there is no suffering greater than hunger, the girl climbed up; the young man seeing that she had climbed up, covered the foot of the tree with thorns, and walked away, saying, I have at last got rid of that woman 
The maiden, not being able to get down, had to remain on the tree till late in the evening when the king returning home passed the place, riding on decorated elephant, the rest is history. 
Was Pinguttara the oldest recorded gay 
Mental disorder or natural inclination
The practice is not a mental disorder that need psychiatric help and is legally accepted in many countries in the world, including UK, as affirmed by World Health Organisation, [WHO]. It is pathetic; the unprovoked discrimination, hate, stress, violence and name-calling, thats how this issue is viewed by a Buddhists society. The criminality lies with those who oppose gay. No man or woman would choose to be gay, they are born like that, and it is not a disease or sickness. Those who engage in research in re-birth believe the inclination is a habit continued from previous birth. A gay man had been born a female for several previous births will continue to have a sexual attraction for and a desire for a man. It is due either to hormonal changes in their bodies or born with it, as they explain. 
There have been cases in the past, especially in village life, where gay people are forced to marry by parents that end up in creating broken homes, unhappiness, misery and other social issues. Just like you cannot make a man a woman or vice-versa [not even JRs Constitution could] one cannot make a gay person hetero-sexual, not even the almighty. The pious religious hypocrisy that makes hurtful and disparaging comments should realize criminalization of homosexuality or treating a segment of our society as criminals for something beyond their control is a worst crime. 
A few years ago in one of those European countries, where they legalized same-sex marriages; a couple, males, queried by a journalist soon after solemnisation by local marriage registrar. 
Whats special tonight 
The senior of the two, who was 62 years, [I cannot recollect the name, but certainly not the legendary singer, pianist, and composer Elton John] and yet holding the hand of his 56-year-old partner [what else can we say, Husband and ..] said, Oh, no, nothing as such, we have been together for the past 32 years! What crime have they committed 
Civil partnership to gay marriage in the UK
In 2005, a Bill known as Civil Partnership Act became law in England, for gay couples to register their union, which was subsequently revised to be known as Gay Marriages Act in 2014. If someone is a gay, its his/her right. The State or religion cannot dictate terms on its queer citizen unless there is commitment of an apparent criminal act.

"No man or woman would choose to be gay, they are born like that, and it is not a disease or sickness. Those who engage in research in re-birth believe the inclination is a habit continued from previous birth"

Wally-E cards are issued with identification photos of the user in order to provide an additional layer of security.

However, speaking to the Daily Mirror, Mr. Jayasuriya said the suggested annual nominal payment stood at Rs.10,000 for the entire block of the land.
"The agreement with the investor is yet to be signed and there is no construction work being carried out on the land at the moment," he said.

Rs.2bn to maintain 200 train compartments: Union
	
The Sri Lanka Railways (SLR) has decided to pay Rs.2 billion to a private company for the maintenance of 200 train compartments, Sri Lanka Nidahas Sevaka Sangamaya General Secretary Nadira Manoj said today.
He said that the Department has awarded a tender to a private firm called Tantri Trailersby ignoring the Ratmalana Railway workshop employees who could have carried out the maintenancework on the compartments.
If the work was entrusted to the Ratmalana workshop, the workers would have carried out the work at half the cost. A mafia is in control of every inch of Railways. State funds are being misused by the management. Why waste money when we have sufficiently trained human resources,he asked.
However, when asked, Railway Sub Departmental Chief Engineer, Dilantha Fernando said that the union was misleading the public by manipulating facts.
He said that the maintenance work was handed over to the Tantri Trailers since railways employees had failed to carry them out.
Many compartments waiting for repairs are abandoned in Dematagoda as the Ratmalana Workshops repair outcome is not satisfactory. Our workers are not capable in these kinds of repairs,he said.
He said the department received hundreds of complaints daily pointing out that the toilets and the interior of the rail carriages were in bad condition. Especially, the Japan made S8 Power-set trains are in a very dilapidated condition; we could not wait till the workshop completes the repairs, he said.
Under the tender conditions, firms have to restore the interior, floor and the toilets completely in the train carriage. However, he said that they would not let the firm touch the compartment body or the under frame and those would be undertaken by the Ratmalana Workshop.
Speaking on the matter, Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry Secretary Nihal Somaweera said that the ministry had taken measures to refurbish 200 carriages to provide a better service to the passengers.
The workshop just has a capacity to refurbish 5 compartments per year. But the private firm has agreed to complete the task within 3 years. He said.
To purchase a new carriage, the department has to spend around Rs.60mn and under the new refurbish contract it could be done at a cost of Rs.10mn.
The firm has to handover five carriages each month and the payment is to be settled monthly. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Thalatha Athukorale: Sajith a role model
	
Minister of Housing and Construction Sajith Premadasa sets a good precedent to other ministers by not using the official vehicle given to him by the government and rejecting his ministerial salary, Minister of Foreign Employment Thalatha Athukorale today said.
Attending a ceremony at Balangoda to lay the foundation stone to initiate the project Udaa Gammana she said that the minister is a role model who doesnt owe anything to the country.
Im a minister, I travel using a government vehicle and we receive a salary from the government. If there is any minister who doesnt benefited by these, it is only him, Im honoured to say that. The Minister is a reflection of his father former President Ranasinghe Premadasa she said.
She reminded that a former Housing and Construction Minister Wimal Weerawansa is now in prison for alleged misuse of government vehicles.
MP Wimal who preached left and socialist politics had become a millionaire today. His hair gel was imported from the USA. I have never seen such a large office table which was used by him during his tenure in the ministry, much larger than a king size bed, she said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Trumps Options: Will he nuke abortion clinics
	
Donald Trump was 12 years old when The Ugly American, a political novel by William J. Lederer and Eugene Burdick was published in 1958. Its doubtful if Trump has read it (if he has a library at home, it would be similar to the one Scott Fitzgeralds fictional hero had in The Great Gatsby). But the new US president unwittingly reminded people around the world about the ugly American in his very first day in office  and the world must endure more than another 1800 days, as Trump tries to remake the world according to his own misogynic vision.
One of Trumps first acts as president was to reinstate the global gag rule which means that every doctor and clinic in the world receiving American aid is prohibited even from talking to women about abortion, even if abortion is legal in their countries.
On the second day, he gave the go ahead to his much touted threat to build a wall along the border with Mexico which shows that nothing much has changed in the way some politicians view the outside world since the Great Wall of China was built. The Chinese at any rate faced a genuine threat of raids and invasions. Donald Trump is so insecure that he dreads an invasion of penniless Mexican immigrants.

Actually, the title of that book was vastly misunderstood. It became a synonym for globe-trotting Americans insensitive to other cultures. But the fictional ugly American in the book is actually a good man, one who works hard with his wife to improve the lot of the farmers of an imaginary Asian country called Sarkhan. If Trump takes the trouble to read the book, he might learn a thing or two from it. But he wont. Instead, we have the proverbial monkey with a razor, albeit in the White House.
This is Trumpism, or Trumpalism, or the realpolitik of Donald Trump. More nail-biting days ahead after these two but, as Audrey Hepburn chirped and shrieked so breathtakingly in My Fair Lady, And without much ado we can all/muddle through without you. But Her Trump right now is the most powerful man on earth. Therefore hes going to be an annoying presence in the lives of millions as we keep counting the days to the next US presidential election. In Sri Lanka, we have a penchant for imaginary spring rolls and one hundred days honeymoons after a new administration is sworn in. The Americans are too practical a people to hold their breath that way. But a safe guess is that, long before that magical, mystical 100, many of those who voted for Trump would end up singing along thus with Hepburn:

What a fool I was, what an addle pated fool
What a mutton-headed dolt was I.
Substitute contemporary American swears words for addle pated fool and mutton-headed dolt. Likewise, abortion clinics around the world will survive the Donald Trump years but millions of women, including some of those who voted from Trump, would be harassed and pushed around, or worse.


"Legal or otherwise, abortion is seen as a functional and health-related necessity all over the world. Trump thinks he can stop it, but hes mistaken."

Why should Donald Trump, a man who openly brags that he likes to grope attractive women, be so unremittingly against abortion Thats a good one for a psychoanalyst with some free time. The Trumps have five children. American political dynasties dont need to visit abortion clinics, at least not for economic reasons. John F. Kennedy and his wife had five children (including one miscarriage). Robert Kennedy and wife Ethel had eleven at a time when family planning was seen as the panacea for all ills in the developing world.
Whatever motivates a woman to go in for an abortion, the choice belongs to her and, as the case may be, her partner. The president or prime minister of that country doesnt need to advise, meddle, lambast or assist. More countries in the world are pro-abortion now. The majority of those where it is illegal could be termed poor, such as Senegal, Kenya, and Uganda in Africa to Bangladesh, Myanmar and Mauritius in Asia (many might feel insulted if Sri Lanka is termed a poor country, so it is up to you) but it is illegal in Ireland and Malta, too; though most of the European Union, as well as almost all of the formerly communist Eastern bloc (excepting Poland) allow it under differing criteria.
Legal or otherwise, abortion is seen as a functional and health-related necessity all over the world. Trump thinks he can stop it, but hes mistaken. Hell be merely seen as a nuisance, though a dangerous one. But, to paraphrase Audrey Hepburn: Abortion clinics will survive despite you.

Under fire, British PM May criticizes Trump curb on refugees
	

REUTERS, 29th JANUARY, 2017- Prime Minister Theresa May said Britain did not agree with U.S. President Donald Trumps curbs on immigration after coming under criticism from lawmakers in her own party for not condemning his executive order when initially questioned.
On a visit to Turkey on Saturday, she was asked three times to comment on Trumps move to put a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the United States and to temporarily bar travellers from Syria and six other Muslim-majority countries, which he said would protect Americans from violent Islamists.
May - who had flown to Turkey from the United States where she was the first foreign leader to meet the new U.S. president for talks she called successful - replied that Washington was responsible for its policy on refugees. But after the prime minister flew back to a political storm in London late on Saturday, coming under fire from within her own party, her spokesman said Britain disagreed with Trumps ban.
