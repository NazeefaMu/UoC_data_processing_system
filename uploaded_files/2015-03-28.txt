EU reimposes ban on LTTE: SL
	
Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Ajith P. Perera said today that European Union (EU) had reimposed the ban on the LTTE due to the positive diplomatic intervention of the Government.
Mr. Perera said the EU court had lifted the ban on the LTTE during the previous government due to its ineffective diplomatic process.
He said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had written to the EU to reconsider the ban on the LTTE as the then leader of the opposition.
Mr. Perera said Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and the Foreign Affairs Ministry intervened with the EU to reimpose the ban on the LTTE and as a result, the? EU had reimposed the ban and added that it was a great diplomatic victory of the country.
The Judgement of the General Court of the European Union last year had annulled measures taken by the Council of the European Union to designate the LTTE as a terrorist organisation and the freezing of their funds.

President Maithripala Sirisena expressed hope that the Free Trade Agreement with China, currently under negotiations, will provide further inputs for value addition and economic cooperation in the region.
Speaking at the Opening Plenary of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference in China, President Sirisena said also that Sri Lanka as a maritime nation with natural ecological advantages will work in tandem with friendly countries to maintain cooperation in the maritime age.
Full speech
Your Excellency Xi Jinping, President of the People?s Republic of China, Honourable Yasuo Fukuda, Chairman, Boao Forum for Asia, Mr Zhou, Wenzhong, Secretary-General Boao Forum for Asia, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen.
It gives me great pleasure to participate in this August assembly, which brings together world leaders as well as the global business community upon a common platform for a constructive and mutually beneficial dialog. Such a meeting is most appropriate in the context of achieving our collective goal of prosperity and development for the people of Asia. Today Asian enterprise is a key driver in global economic development as Asian economies continues to grow they have also become more complex and more integrated with each other and with the rest of the world. The theme of this year?s forum Asia?s New Future: Towards a Community of Common Destiny is relevant and timely.
The wealth of Asia is measured in GDP per capita terms differs wildly among and within stages even as Asia has the majority of the world?s population accounting for nearly sixty percent of the estimated 7.2 billion, it is also home to majority of the world?s poor.
The rising prosperity many of our Asian countries is evident in the high consumption and high expenditure. There is an ever-growing disparity among the people. In my address to the nation last month, on the national day, I highlighted this issue and made a sincere promise to reduce the income gap and eliminate poverty as a key objective of my government.
Excellences, ladies and gentlemen.
There remains a notable disparity in the decree of intra-regional integration. This calls for a new thinking on Asian growth strategy and more cooperative partnership among the community of Asia. Simplified trade and reducing non-tariff barriers is vital in order to enhance connectivity.
The Asian region is also still largely dependent on extra-regional markets for its final exports and lacks significant counterparts within the region. In such a scenario, how do we achieve a community of common destiny for Asia? The answers needs developing appropriate public policies, strategies to respond to these challenges while taking into consideration the specific differences in respective countries. Sri Lanka is committed to such cooperation and collective action within the community of Asian nations.
The people of Sri Lanka on the 8th of January gave me an overwhelming mandate to take the country on a path of progress, as nation welcoming a new dawn of democracy, good governance, the rule of law and equal opportunities for all. Toward this end, my government is implementing ambitious hundred day programme, inclusion of constitutional reforms to usher in a new political culture, as well as achieving lasting national reconciliation among all communities.
Sri Lanka as a maritime nation with natural ecological advantages will work in tandem with friendly countries to maintain cooperation in the maritime age. Sri Lanka is currently identified as a country with relatively high growth among emerging market economies. The country?s growth in per capita terms in recent years is comparable to middle income economy levels.
We are hopeful that our FTA with China, currently under negotiations, will provide further inputs for value addition and economic cooperation in the region.
Our inbound tourism from China has increased significantly, and Asian countries rank among the top investors in Sri Lanka.
This important forum can play a significant role to achieve our collective vision of an Asian community of common destiny.
In conclusion, I take this opportunity to convey my best wishes for a successful and productive outcome for the Boao Forum for Asia 2015.
Thank you.

Govt. can?t say whether Udayanga guilty or not: Dy. Minister
	
Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Ajith P. Perera said the Government was still not in a position to state whether former Ambassador to Russia, Udayanga Weeratunga was guilty of the allegations levelled against him by the Ukraine Government that he supplied arms to rebels in Ukraine.
?We cannot yet state whether he is guilty or not because the probe hasn?t yet begun. But his conduct has definitely raised suspicions because he has not handed over his diplomatic passport or had completed the process that has to be carried out by the diplomats whose term of office has ended. In fact, we have been unable to determine his current location,? he said.
The deputy minister said it was not certain whether the former diplomat is still in Russia or in Ukraine but his last known whereabouts place him in Ukraine, where he has been managing a restaurant.
?He is a close relative of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa. Therefore, the former President and his family too are implicated in the charges that have been made against Mr. Weeratunga,? he said and added that though the extent of his responsibility could not be determined, the detailed charges levelled against Mr. Weeratunga were grave and were offenses under either domestic or international laws.
?The Ukraine government has written to the former government concerning his activities but no response has been made and that is why they have written to us again noting down the list of allegations against Mr. Weeratunga and the types of weapons he has supplied and their numbers,? the deputy minister added.
He said they have not yet sought the assistance of Ukraine or the Russian Governments to continue the probe and added that they were awaiting the return of Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera from China, before appointing a high-level committee to probe the allegations. (Lakna Paranamanna)

Some DPL passport holders asked to explain
	
The Defence and Urban Development Ministry is reviewing the issuance of DPL passports and have requested some of the DPL passport holders to explain the rationale for obtaining this class of travel document entailing many privileges, a senior Immigration and Emigration Department official said yesterday.
The Assistant Controller (legal), Department of Immigration and Emigration told Daily Mirror that the department had asked certain DPL passport holders to explain how they had obtained a DPL passport and the circumstances that led to obtaining them.
?Under the former regime, the Presidential Secretariat nominated and recommended certain people to be issued DPL passports. No public officer dares question a recommendation from the Presidential Secretariat and clarify whether a particular person?s suitability to be issued a DPL passport. But we believe that the guidelines adopted by the previous government to issue DPL passports must be reviewed,? Mr. De Zoysa said.
The Defence and Urban Development Ministry had identified 39 categories under which DPL passports were issued on the recommendation of the Presidential Secretariat.
?The Department is not concerned about issuing DPL passports to VIP politicians like the President, the Prime Minister, Opposition Leader, ministers, senior public officials like Judges of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal, diplomats and ministry secretaries. But the questions being asked is where such passports have been issued to spouses and children of officials serving in foreign missions,? Mr. De Zoysa said.
He said the Immigration and Emigration Department would cancel the DPL passports if holders failed to give valid reasons for holding a DPL passport.
The Department has issued 1,809 DPL passports and has called for explanations from about 50 of them.
Such passports have been issued in the past to officials holding substantive appointments in the Overseas Service including officials posted to Sri Lankan Missions from the Department of Commerce.
While serving abroad, the spouses and children of these officials were also entitled for DPL passports. All Foreign Service Officers, all Executive Staff Officers while serving in Foreign Ministry, Chief Prelates of Buddhist Nikayas, Islam and Hindu Chief Priests and the Commissioner in- charge of Tea Promotion work were also entitled to hold DPL passports.
