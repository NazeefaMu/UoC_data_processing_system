Duminda contemplates independent list
	
Former UPFA MP Duminda Silva, who is unlikely to get nomination, is contemplating the possibility of fielding an independent list. Yet, the UPFA has come under pressure from his supporters in Kolonnawa urging that he be given nominations.
A group led by some Buddhist monks held a protest rally in Colombo yesterday demanding nominations for Mr. Silva.UNP buoyed by new political front
The UNP, which was somewhat disappointed at the turn of events leading to former president Mahinda Rajapaksa being nominated by the UPFA to contest the general election, was elated after the Jathika Hela Urumaya and a section of the SLFP MPs loyal to President Maitripala Sirisena joined it to form a common political front against the UPFA.
Buoyed by the formation of the United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG), UNPers have sprung into action with confidence. The current political scenario which was least expected even by several political analysts has altered the political equation for the second time before the close of nominations today. First, it happened after Mr. Rajapaksa?s nomination on the UPFA ticket was confirmed.
It is well known that those who joined the UNP to contest the election under the elephant symbol were mainly instrumental in tilting the voting patterns in favour of President Maithripala Sirisena at the January 8 election, particularly in urban areas.
Against this background it is believed that they could tilt the votes in favout of the Good Governance Front at the August 17 general election as well where the front is contesting under a single symbol. The new political front is making every effort to safeguard the aspirations of the 6.2 million people who voted for change and the ouster of the Mahinda Rajapalsa regime. The party leaders who signed the MoU said the forces that unseated Mr. Rajapaksa under the swan symbol, have now been united under the elephant symbol and defeat the Rajapaksa comeback.
If the January 8 voting patterns remain unchanged it will be possible for the Good Governance Front to secure a sizable majority, but political compulsions in the Western Province especially in Colombo may make it difficult to assess how the impact of the new front will trickle down to semi urban and rural areas.* UPFA sees otherwise
But the UPFA sees the latest move by the UNP in a different light saying it is not an unusual phenomenon.
?Only the MPs, who defected from the UPFA prior to the January 8 election, have struck a political deal with the UNP. Therefore, our vote base remains intact. Besides, we have introduced new faces and infused young blood into our side,? a UPFA politician said.
Former MPs Mervyn Silva, Sajin de Vaas Gunawardane, and Sarana Gunawardane have been refused nominations.* Basil not in the fray
Former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa, who handled his brother's presidential election campaign has opted not to contest and this means three slots have fallen from the Gampaha district in the UPFA list. Another slot has fallen vacant with former JHU MP Ven. Athuraliye Ratana Thera deciding to support the UNP-led front.
The UPFA nominations lists barring Colombo and Gampaha have been finalised.* Sudarshani against nomination for three others
In Gampaha, former MP Sudarshani Fernandopulle has opposed nomination to three members of three UPFA allies. The matter was yet to be sorted out.
The UPFA has had to find a new candidate to replace Western Provincial Council member Hirunika Premachandra who quit the party and was nominated on the UNP list.* Former Navy Commander, Tissa Attanayake, GL, Dayan in UPFA National List
Former Navy Commander Wasantha Karannagoda, Dr. Dayan Jayatilake, Tissa Attanayake and G.L. Peiris are among those being accomated in the UPFA national list. (Kelum Bandara)

Emirates increases service to Seattle with launch of second daily flight
	
Emirates, a global connector of people, places and economies, has announced its second daily service from Dubai International Airport (DXB) to Seattle?Tacoma International Airport (SEA).?
The new service, EK227, which began on July 7 and is operated by a Boeing 777-200LR, will depart Dubai at 3:15 a.m. and arrives in Seattle at 6:55 a.m. The return flight, EK228, departs Seattle at 9:40 a.m. and arrives in Dubai at 10:55 a.m. the following day. The new service will supplement the current EK 230 Boeing 777-300ER flight departing Seattle at 5:40 p.m. and landing in Dubai the following day at 6:55 p.m.
?This new service will provide passengers with the convenience of both a morning and evening departure from both Dubai as well as Seattle,? said Emirates Divisional Senior Vice President Commercial Operations West Hubert Frach.?
?This second daily service will provide our passengers in the Seattle area even more choices when flying with Emirates and satisfy their demand for more flights from this gateway. Corporate travellers will also appreciate the ease of conducting business as a result of the improved connectivity between Seattle and a number of international destinations. So when corporate travellers are headed to an Emirates? destination in the Middle East, Africa, or the Far East or when they require one of Emirates? frequent daily connections to Hyderabad, Mumbai, or Delhi, the global business community will now seem much more closer to Seattle.?
Passengers coming from Dubai and beyond can connect to other US cities through Emirates? partner agreement with Alaska Airlines (AS). Members of Alaska Airlines? Mileage Plan and Emirates? Skywards programmes have been able to earn and redeem miles for travel on either carrier since March 2012. These flights offer connectivity to points across the United States such as Portland, Anchorage, Honolulu, Billings and Boise as well as into Canada including cities such as Vancouver, Edmonton, Victoria and Calgary.?
Passengers flying into Seattle will spot the iconic Space Needle from the sky. Much like the souks in Old Dubai, Seattle visitors can taste the local flavours at a day spent at Pike Place Market. Ride along the Puget Sound on Seattle-Bainbridge Island ferry or zip from the Seattle Aquarium to Chinatown on the Seattle Centre Monorail, a World?s Fair legacy.
The second Seattle flight will be operated with one of Emirates? Boeing 777-200LR aircraft, which will create a 75 percent jump in seating capacity with 4,340 weekly seats on offer to Dubai. This second flight will effectively move Seattle into the number two position in the US market in terms of seat capacity, behind New York John F. Kennedy International Airport.
Emirates? Boeing 777-200LR features eight First Class suites, 42 Business Class lie-flat beds and 216 Economy Class seats. All passengers can enjoy over 2,000 free channels of films, TV shows, music, games and podcasts through ice, the airline?s multi-award winning in-flight entertainment system, regionally inspired gourmet cuisine and Emirates? renowned inflight service from the airline?s multi-national cabin crew comprised of over 135 nationalities. Additionally, First Class and Business Class passengers can experience Emirates? Chauffeur-drive service, available in over 70 cities worldwide.
The increased number of flights will also provide more connections to Emirates? vast and growing network of destinations in Africa, the Middle East, the Indian Subcontinent, Asia and beyond. The additional service will also allow Emirates SkyCargo to carry an additional 15 tons of cargo per trip including locally grown cherries, electrical equipment and machinery, as well as medical equipment and aircraft parts.
Emirates launched service to Seattle just over three years ago in March 2012 and has since flown more than 600,000 passengers on the route. Emirates has a deeply rooted history with Seattle based company Boeing and was the launch customer of Boeing?s 777X. Emirates continues to be the world?s largest Boeing 777 operator, flying 145 of these aircraft with another 199 on order.?

HNB Leasing offers 9.5% for vehicles registered during promo
	
		 		 
		 
			
Hatton National Bank (HNB) is offering the lowest interest rate for registered vehicles in the history of leasing, in celebration of the 25th anniversary of HNB?s landmark initiative of introducing leasing to the country.
Throughout the month of July customers can enjoy unbeatable interest rates from 9.5 percent upwards for cars, vans, jeeps, SUVs, dual purpose and hybrid vehicles. This is the latest in a series of special promotions from HNB Leasing in its silver jubilee year to offer the best deals and popularize leasing among the public.
Senior Manager Leasing Kanchana Karunagama commented on the new promotion and the reasons for its introduction.
?These special rates are similar to the rates we offer for the leasing of brand new/unregistered vehicles and our aim is to popularise the financing of registered vehicles, which is a steadily growing market with great potential.

Our special options such as Flexi Plan, Cash Back, My Dream and Easy Pay offer flexible repayment options to customers and provide them the power of choice, which helps to make HNB the best bank for leasing.?
This special promotion for registered vehicles goes hand in hand with the Cash Back option, providing additional benefits to customers. Cash Back targets business community to finance their working capital requirements by way of re-leasing the same asset. Under this option, any person who owns a vehicle or enjoys a loan/ lease facility in any other financial institution can receive cash by obtaining a lease facility from HNB Leasing, for the business or even for a personal requirement.?
The My Dream option allows customers to upgrade their vehicles by settling their existing lease/ loan facility with 100 percent concessions/ rebates on future interests. Customers with good repayment records will have the opportunity to upgrade their vehicles without offering guarantors/ additional collateral, even if they enjoy the facility with other financial institutions.
Yet another exciting feature is Easy Pay, through which an existing customer who has obtained a lease can make bulk payments at different intervals, in addition to the agreed monthly rental. This will help customers shorten repayment periods and reduce/ adjust lease rentals to suit fluctuating income patterns.
The Residual Value option allows customers to finance a vehicle at a low monthly rental by retaining part of their lease amount, which can then be paid along with the final installment. Thereafter the customer can choose from several settlement options for the residual amount, such as upgrading the vehicle through another lease or settling the amount with his or her savings. In addition, customers have the option of entering in to staggered payments and planning their own repayment terms based on their income levels through the Flexi Plan option. This offers them the convenience and flexibility of deciding their repayment amount and the term based on their income levels.
Kanchana Karunagama encouraged the public to avail themselves of this rare opportunity.
?In this special leasing promotion, the interest rate that would apply for a vehicle is very much similar to the rates we offer for brand new/ unregistered vehicles. We invite and request all existing and prospective customers to grab this opportunity and fulfill the dream in owning a vehicle.?

Kuwait Airways completes first phase of fleet development
	
Kuwait Airways, the national airline of the State of Kuwait, has completed its first stage of the fleet development.?
Kuwait Airways received its seventh and last Airbus A320 CEO aircraft, as the outcome of the agreement of leasing 12 Airbus of similar type. This marks the start of the major fleet renewal plan.
The A320 single-aisle jetliner family is the world?s best-selling single-aisle aircraft family and its versatility will support Kuwait Airways? range of services.
The airline has also decided to equip its new A320 fleet with Airbus? innovative Runway Overrun Prevention System (ROPS) technology. This on-board cockpit technology, which Airbus has pioneered independently over several years, increases pilots? situational awareness during landing, reduces exposure to runway excursion risk and if necessary, provides active protection.
In addition, passengers are given the privilege to access other services such as satellite live television broadcasts, safety instructions in their own language, outside live views from landscape cameras, international news or connecting flight information. The integration of the latest generation IFE platforms into the seat preserves passengers? legroom and also gives them the ability to connect their own Personal Electronic Devices, such as a smartphone, tablet or laptop, to the screen in their seat, whilst benefiting from the high-quality audio headsets and viewing comfort of the larger screens available onboard.
Incorporating all of the benefits, the new A320 includes 18 inch wide seat standard for un-matched passenger comfort, and extra wide aisle for faster boarding and highly efficient in-flight service. Kuwait Airways will be operating a younger fleet of aircraft in future to cater its customer with comfort while enduring their journey.
The new aircraft, which has been leased by Kuwait Airways recently, has a total of 130 seats with 114 Economy Class and 16 Business Class seatings. ?Kuwait Airways has added these New A320s to Amman, Bahrain, Beirut, Cairo, Dammam, Doha, Jeddah, Medina and Riyadh Middle Eastern sectors. Further, Kuwait Airways has received its second A330 in part of the fleet renewal plan.

Prime Grameen records Rs. 827 mn PBT for 2014/15
	
Prime Grameen has concluded a highly successful 2014/15 with impressive figures in several financial and non-financial indicators.
During this period Prime Grameen recorded an NPL of 0.88 percent in an industry where loans are given free of collateral and the gross NPL average is over 6 percent. This speaks volumes of the effectiveness of the company?s credit management process which is strengthened by a well-defined credit evaluation process, enabling the company to disburse quality loans.
Profit Before Tax (PBT) of Rs.827 million, a 50 percent increase from 2013/14, indicates a continuation of the impressive growth which has placed the Company in a strong position to forge ahead in the new financial year. Furthermore, Prime Grameen has increased its total Fixed Deposits (FD) by a staggering 113 percent from 2013/14, with an FD customer base growth of 27 percent. This is a result of the strong confidence the Company has built up among the general public over the years.?
These impressive numbers were achieved with the support of the Board of Hatton National Bank (HNB), which acquired a 51 percent voting stake of the Company in November 2014, and Prime Lands, the sole owners of the Company till the acquisition by HNB.?
Jonathan Alles - Chairman - Prime Grameen said: ?Micro finance is a key sector in the economy which drives equality of wealth distribution, regional development and poverty alleviation, which are key economic development indicators. Prime Grameen has over a decade being involved in providing support for the development of micro entrepreneurs and today it has evolved to be one of the key micro finance providers in the country. HNB too has been involved in micro credit for over 25 years through its flagship ?Gami Pubuduwa? scheme and this commitment of the Bank towards micro finance resulted in HNB acquiring a controlling interest in Prime Grameen late last year. This partnership between HNB and Prime Grameen will no doubt take the micro finance industry in Sri Lanka to the next level.?
Commenting on these figures, Chaminda Prabhath ? Managing Director/ CEO of Prime Grameen said that it was the result of a collective effort by all employees.?
Prime Grameen introduced three new loan products tailor-made to suit their customers? requirements. Under the broad theme of ?not a burden, but a comfort?, the Prime Grameen ?Ezy Loans? scheme was introduced to the business community of Sri Lanka with a view to facilitating flexibility and expeditious approvals. Two other loan schemes were introduced targeting small and medium scale enterprises titled ?Swashakthi? and ?Abhilasha?. The ?Abhilasha? Loan scheme was aimed at both male and female individual entrepreneurs providing enhanced financial services with greater flexibility and prolonged repayment periods. The ?Swashakthi? Loan scheme launched during the year offers financial assistance to the savings customer base as loans are granted under this scheme against their savings accounts with less paper work and flexibility.
Prime Grameen increased its customer base by 20.35 percent in 2014/15, an indicator of the growing stature and public acceptance of the company. The company grew its Loans and Advances by 60 percent and its total asset base by a remarkable 73 percent.?
It is notable that these impressive figures were achieved during a period of declining interest rates and volatile market conditions. Plans are in place to expand the Prime Grameen network and serve the financial needs of Sri Lankans in the rural areas including all Provinces, which will result in further growth in the customer base, during the 2015/16 financial year.

REUTERS: The Sri Lankan rupee was trading weaker yesterday aftear a state-owned bank pegged its exchange rate to the dollar at 133.80, 20 cents lower than its previous close, dealers said, the first fall in seven sessions for the spot currency.
The state-run bank had since July 2 sold dollars at 133.60 until Friday to keep the currency stable.
?The state bank is selling at 133.80,? a currency dealer said. ?There is importer demand because it is the first day after the weekend.?
The currency has appreciated 0.3 percent through Monday since it hit a record low of 134.20 against the dollar on June 18.
The Central Bank may not be able to sustain the rupee?s appreciation trend as import demand could pick up due to lower interest rates, dealers and analysts said.
The pressure on the currency could also build if exporters stop selling dollars until after the August 17 Parliamentary elections, dealers said.
