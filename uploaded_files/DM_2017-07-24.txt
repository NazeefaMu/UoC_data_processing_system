Venezuelans opposition calls new strike, violence flares
	

REUTERS, 23rd JULY, 2017- Venezuelas opposition called a two-day national strike against President Nicolas Maduro after another day of violent clashes on Saturday where the injured included a violinist famous for his musical protests.
The opposition coalition - which organized a 24-hour shutdown this week that was heeded by millions and paralyzed large swathes of the South American nation - said the next strike would be on Wednesday and Thursday.
Mass marches were also planned for Monday and Friday in an effort to force Maduro into aborting a controversial July 30 election for a new congress. The fast-escalating political showdown in the South American OPEC nation comes after more than 100 people have died and thousands more been injured in anti-government unrest since demonstrations began in April.

Aloysius paid Ravis penthouse lease rental: Anika
	
Former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake and his family leased out a penthouse at Monarch Residencies for eight months with the monthly lease rental Rs.1.45 million being paid by Arjun Aloysius, a key witness revealed at the PCoI proceedings yesterday.
Testifying at the PCoI, Construction Company Director Anika Wijesuriya said she had owned a Penthouse at Monarch Residencies in Kollupitiya which she wanted to rent-out during December, 2015.
Subsequently, in early January, 2016, former finance minister Ravi Karunanayake and his wife Mela had inquired from the witness' brother about renting the apartment. Later the witness contacted Ms. Karunanayake and carried out initial negotiations about renting the apartment.
It was revealed that the Karunanayake family was looking for an apartment to stay during the renovations being carried out at their residence in Rajamalwatte, Kotte.
Ms. Wijesuriya had later asked Ms. Karunanayake to visit the apartment to examine it. It was revealed that during the examination Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. owner Arjun Aloysius had also arrived at the apartment and had assured the witness that he would lease out the apartment.
Ms. Wijesuriya said she was aware at the time that Mr. Aloysius would be the lessor while the Karunanayake family occupied the apartment.
The witness also explained that she developed a friendship with Mr. Aloysius and his wife before the lease agreement was signed.
When questioned by the PCoI, the witness said the apartment was leased at a monthly rental of Rs.1.45 million.
The lease agreement amounted to Rs.7.3 million while an additional Rs.1.4 million was paid to the witness by cash.
Ms. Wijesuriya said she entered into a lease agreement with the Company called Walt and Row Pvt Ltd, to which the Rs.7.3 million was transferred by the Perpetual Capital Holdings Pvt Ltd, to be paid to her.
The witness confirmed that the Karunanayake family occupied the penthouse.
In July, 2016, there was news published on websites regarding the incident highlighting the Karunanayake family occupying an apartment, with the rental paid by Mr. Aloysius.
In the wake of media reports, the witness revealed that Mr. Aloysius had asked her to destroy the lease agreement.
He said he destroyed his copy of the lease agreement and asked me to do the same, but I was confused with the request because the documentation would generally be available at the public records room and did not do what he asked me to do, the witness said.
She said she also contacted Ms. Karunanayake afterwards and talked about the media reports and their negative impact on her as the owner of the apartment.
The witness said she had asked Ms. Karunanayake to either purchase the apartment or vacate it considering the circumstances.
However, the witness said she allowed the Karunanayake family to occupy the apartment for another two months allocating the refundable deposited money into it because the renovations of their residence were not concluded.
Then the witness had called Mr. Aloysius and informed about the extension of the lease agreement.
The witness said the Karunanayake family later conveyed their willingness verbally to buy the apartment and settled on a price of Rs.165 million.
She said a Company known as Global Transportation and Logistics Pvt Ltd, in which Ms. Karunanayake and her daughter Onella were directors, purchased the apartment in September 2016.
When questioned by DSG Yasantha Kodagoda who led the evidence in chief, the witness revealed that Ravi Karunanayake had phoned her father last Saturday prior to testifying at the PCoI.
Presidents counsel Kalinga Indatissa also crossexamined the witness. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

## Title: Cigarettes becoming more affordable in ASEAN countries

Cigarettes becoming more affordable in ASEAN countries
	
Raising tobacco taxes is one of the most effective and cost-effective measures to reduce tobacco consumption and prevalence of tobacco use. Cigarette price increases discourage new smokers who are sensitive to price changes, particularly preventing the youth from smoking. 
The 180 States Parties to the World Health Organization (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) have committed to continually and substantially reduce the prevalence of tobacco use and recognize that price and tax measures are an effective and important means of reducing tobacco consumption by various segments of the population, in particular young persons (FCTC Article 6). 
As such, the WHO has described tobacco tax increases as a best buy intervention that has significant public health impact and is highly cost-effective, inexpensive and feasible to implement. However, according to the 2015 WHO Report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic, only 10% of the worlds people live in countries with sufficiently high tobacco taxes. 
The Southeast Asia Tobacco Control Alliance (SEATCA) is a regional multi-sectoral, non-profit, non-governmental alliance that supports ASEAN Member States in developing and implementing effective, evidence-based tobacco control policies in line with the WHO - FCTC. 


SEATCA works closely with governments, non-government organizations (NGOs), development agencies, and the academe to advance tobacco control in the ASEAN region by facilitating increased participation and cooperation among advocates, organizing regional forums for sharing best practices and lessons learned, and acting as a regional leader to tackle urgent priority issues affecting the region. 
Worlds first Tobacco Tax Index by SEATCA compares the current progress of tobacco tax policy in the region against the WHO-FCTC Article 6 Guidelines to help governments identify and close gaps in and strengthen implementation of tobacco tax policies in their countries. 
The index shows that while some countries have made significant progress in formulating and implementing tobacco tax policies, the region as a whole has advanced slowly in the past few years, outpaced by economic and income growth. Most countries also do not have any long-term tobacco tax policies with regularly evaluated fiscal and public health targets. Important obstacles in some countries are their ineffective tobacco tax structures and weak tax administration, as well as tobacco industry interference in tobacco tax policy formulation or in tax administration. 
The study recommends the following
1. The WHO FCTC Article 6 Guidelines clearly state that implementation of Article 6 of the treaty is an essential element of tobacco-control policies; however, while all ASEAN countries recognize tobacco taxes as a significant source of government revenue, not all countries consider tobacco tax policy as public health policy. All governments should develop and implement long-term tobacco tax policies that include public health targets with periodic evaluations and adjustments. 


2. Down trading or shifting to lower-priced tobacco products is expected and has been observed in countries where tax systems allow for wider retail price gaps. Because this diminishes the public health objective of reducing consumption, governments should apply a uniform specific tax system or a mixed system with a minimum specific tax floor, and should tax all tobacco products in a comparable way, such as in Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, and Singapore. 


3. Since licensing is a vital requisite for controlling the supply chain and for effective tax administration, all countries should implement a comprehensive licensing system for all parts of the tobacco supply chain. This should cover manufacturing equipment and, where appropriate, retailers and tobacco growers. 


4. In combination with licensing, adequate record keeping is also crucial for governments to know the whole range and magnitude of the tobacco business. In line with FCTC Articles 5.3 and their implementing guidelines (and also listed in the FCTC Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products), governments should require the tobacco industry to periodically submit detailed financial reports that include information on tobacco production, manufacture and sales volumes, price by brands, market share, marketing expenditures and revenues, taxes due and paid, and volumes of raw material inputs, among others. This evidence will help governments monitor the impact of tax increases on employment and illicit trade in the tobacco sector and respond to arguments from the industry.  Making these reports publicly available allows for independent analysis of the reports and may be a critical means for governments to effectively regulate the tobacco industry and prevent the submission of fraudulent reports. 


5. While most countries make use of fiscal markings, such as tax stamps, to increase tax compliance, countries should also standardize pack sizes to increase the efficiency of tax administration and establish a tracking and tracing system, including markings with a unique identifier, to further secure the supply chain, reducing the risk of tobacco products entering the illicit market, and assist in investigations of illicit trade. All countries should also implement anti-forestalling measures as recommended in the Article 6 Guidelines to prevent tax avoidance and ensure that governments collect the additional revenues from tax increases, learning from the experience of countries, such as Philippines and Singapore. 


6. All countries should follow the lead of Brunei Darussalam and Singapore that prohibit duty-free tobacco sales or of the Philippines that imposes excise on duty-free products, as exempting duty-free tobacco products from excise taxes is contrary to the overall objectives of increasing tobacco tax revenues and discouraging tobacco use. Banning duty-free tobacco will also reduce large-scale smuggling of tobacco products through economic free zones and duty-free channels. 


7. In accordance with the FCTC Article 5.3 implementing guidelines and the guiding principles of the FCTC Article 6 implementing guidelines, governments should implement a code of conduct for all government ministries and officials that prohibits unnecessary government interactions with the tobacco industry and requires full transparency and accountability of any interactions necessary for the effective regulation, supervision, and control of the industry, including in the formulation and implementation of tobacco tax policies. 
8. Since most countries have insufficient resources for tobacco control, they should seriously consider dedicating tobacco excise revenues for FCTC implementation, such as in Lao PDR, Thailand, and Vietnam. Ref: SEATCA

CPC launch indefinite strike
	
The Ceylon Petroleum Cooperation (CPC) Trade Union launched an indefinite strike from midnight today citing what it called the governments inability to repeal the agreement which would allegedly handover the China Bay oil tanks farm in Trincomalee to India and the Hambantota port to China.
CPC TU Collective Convener D. J. Rajakaruna said a cabinet paper was planned to be presented tomorrow (25) to Parliament regarding the handing over of the china-bay oil tanks to India and Hambantota port oil tanks to china.
During the strike, there would be no fuel distribution in the country.
The strike would be launched at the CPC premises midnight today by preventing the supply of fuel to fuel stations.
If there was no positive response within tomorrow, the CPC would suspend the fuel bunkering, he said.
He said the CPC Trade Union Collective had conduct several discussions with the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and relevant government ministers but it had been left more than three months since April 24 and still the government had failed to convey favourable response.
Therefore, we have to go for an indefinite strike. We had given more time to the government because the government was in a critical situation due to recent disasters. But the government didnt even consider our demands, Mr. Rajakaruna said.
Even the Prime Minister had made a statement saying the handover of the Hambantota oil tank farm and its land areas to Chinese organisation will take place by next month.
As CPC Trade Union we urged the government to change their decision of hand over the Hambantota and Trincomalee oil tank farms to china and provide us an acceptable response", he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Dengue mosquito menace Simple Alternatives HIGHLIGHT
	
Dengue is now centre stage in the Newspapers, Radio and on TV.
However, the whole focus is on prevention  and rightly so But perhaps there are other approaches that have not been presented to the public and perhaps this letter could be used or more effectively in an editorial, to bring it to the notice of the public.
But first let us look at the facts.
A week or so ago, it was reported in the Dally Mirror that Government researchers had found that there are now two mosquito types that carry the virus and that the Dengue-causing mosquitoes have also developed a resistance to the chemicals used in fogging and in drains.
It is of course well known, that insects are able to develop resistance to chemical pesticides.
So, if Mosquitoes can develop resistance to chemicals, we too can increase our NATURAL resistance to viral diseases. It is actually quite simple but we need to take action to increase our resistance (like taking action to go jogging for our health).


Action to be taken: (1) Daily eat 5 or 6 leaves of RAW Holy Basil (Thulasi in Tamil, Maduruthala in Sinhala) in Mallums or salads as it is an adaptogen a bio-chemical that increases resistance to viral diseases (See attached article  from www.mercola.com) (2) Reduce and if possible eliminate foods that lowers your resistance to disease, such as refined white sugar (basically a chemical like any lab chemical), and therefore uses up vital minerals in order to be digested, lowering disease resistance, bone loss in older people etc.
Use alternatives like Kitul or Coconut jaggery or treacle (pani). (3) Reduce and if possible eliminate white flour products because they contain Gluten which also lowers resistance and even promotes ill health. (4) We all know that many farmers use chemical fertilizers and pesticides and we know from Facebook and you-tube that other local and imported food products too have chemicals.
So choosing Organic foods may be wise even though it may be more expensive.


With regard to the problem of resistance to Fogging Chemicals, a simple natural alternative is to use Neem (Kohomba) oil. This has to be mixed with a little detergent (such as dish-washing liquid) to counteract the oiliness, so that it could be used as a spray. Unlike chemicals (which have a single chemical that kills), Natural insecticides have an arsenal of different bio-chemicals which is why insects cannot easily develop resistance to them For stagnant water in drains etc. (blocked by people using drains as rubbish dumps) , a simple and inexpensive alternative is to use waste engine oil. The oil forms a film on the surface and mosquito larvae in the Pupal Stage (when they are shaped like a comma) are air breathers and come to the surface to breath air. The oil blocks their breathing tube on the top of the comma and they die.
Note  the harmful chemicals used as additives in Engine oils are burnt in waste or used engine oil, so that the remaining oil is say 90 percent similar to the oils extracted from the earth and therefore biodegradable.

It provides a number of benefits to both the employees and the comfort of knowledge to the employers, that your employees are very well protected.
Further, the employers are able to benefit from this as a strategic measure in line with their human resource practices in order to cement and strengthen their employee-employer relationships as well the psychological contract with the organisation, as we firmly believe that motivated and happy employees reflect the true values of an organisation.
HNBA Chief Operating Officer Prasantha Fernando elaborating on this product added, The companies could choose from one of the four packages that we have to offer that ranges from just providing a basic life cover for ones staff, to providing an annuity, to offering a comprehensive bouquet of covers that include critical illness, disability cover and hospital cash.

Ive got complete power to pardon: trump in raging twitter rant
	
The president defended his son Donald Trump Jr. and highlighted his complete power to pardon while lashing out at the investigation into his presidential campaigns possible ties to Russia in a Twitter rant onSaturday morning. 
Trump, who has continually used his presidential campaign rival Hillary Clinton as a foil, tried to throw the heat off his son, questioning why his Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, and Special Counsel Robert Mueller were not investigating Clinton instead. 
So many people are asking why isnt the A.G. or Special Counsel looking at the many Hillary Clinton or Comey crimes. 33,000 emails deleted, he wrote on Twitter.  What about all of the Clinton ties to Russia, including Podesta Company, Uranium deal, Russian Reset, big dollar speeches etc.  My son Donald openly gave his e-mails to the media & the authorities whereas Crooked Hillary Clinton deleted (& acid washed) her 33,000 e-mails! 
The FBI decided last year not to recommend criminal charges against Clinton for her use of a private email server. Trump fired former FBI Director James Comey in May.As the investigation closes in on Trumps closest associates, the president has inquired about his authority to issue pardons to aides, family members, and perhaps himself, according to the Washington Post

Killing family: Tamil widow blames RUC for training STF
	
A Tamil widow, who has said 10 of her relatives were massacred by Sri Lankas police in 1986, has lodged a complaint with Northern Irelands Police Ombudsman after Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) links to Sri Lankas security forces emerged, the Irish Times reported today.
It said senior Sri Lankan police officers had visited Belfast in 1983 to see at first hand the roles of the police and army in counter-terrorist operations, according to secret British government files.
The visit happened months after the Special Support Unit, an elite RUC police commando team, shot dead six men in Co Armagh in one of the most controversial episodes of the Troubles.
Sri Lankan police set up an almost identical commando unit shortly afterwards, called the Special Task Force. The complainant, who cannot be named for safety reasons, says the Special Task Force was responsible for the murder of my family in 1986.
Both the RUC and Sri Lankan units consisted of heavily armed police officers who underwent Special Forces training, the article said.
The complainants lawyer, Darragh Mackin said the Special Task Force would not have acquired the paramilitary characteristics of the Special Support Unit without the engagement between the RUC and the Sri Lankan Police.
Vairamuttu Varadakumar, director of the Tamil Information Centre, welcomed the development. We support the complainants efforts to seek accountability for the brutal violence against their family, he said.
He said his organisation, which has documented violence against Tamil people for 35 years, was painfully aware of the murders, rape, disappearances and torture of the Tamil people at the hands of the Special Task Force.
Declassified files found at the UK National Archives show that civil servants privately harboured fears about these police units before the shootings even took place.
The article further said a CIA report, written around the time that the complainants family members were killed, was highly critical of Sri Lankas Special Task Force.
US intelligence staff were concerned that a common STF tactic when fired upon while on patrol is to enter the nearest village and burn it to the ground.
Mr Mackin has told the Police Ombudsman that the level of indiscriminate killing perpetrated by the unit against Tamils amounted to genocide.
A spokesperson from the ombudsman has said they have received a complaint relating to the actions of police officers in the 1980s and it is now being considered.

Meanwhile, the minister criticized the police spokesman for his statement that the shooting was not planned.
The spokesman said the incident was neither planned nor the judge was targeted. He said some drunken men had suddenly snatched a gun from a police officer and fired shots at the others.

Maldivian parliament on lockdown
	
The Maldivian army has locked down the country's parliament after the opposition vowed to move ahead with a vote against a key ally of President Abdulla Yameen, Al Jazeera news reported a short while ago.
The opposition, which gained a parliamentary majority after several government lawmakers defected earlier this month, was planning to hold a no-confidence motion against Speaker Abdulla Maseeh on Monday before the lockdown was forced into effect.
They accuse Maseeh of ignoring allegations of corruption, mismanagement and rights abuses.
The ruling party, however, declared the motion invalid after Yameen announced that four of the defectors had lost their parliamentary seats.
Ahmed Mahloof, an opposition lawmaker, said soldiers carrying batons followed the MPs inside the parliament house and forcibly ejected them.
"Soldiers in riot gear are dragging elected members out from the parliament," Mahloof told Al Jazeera.
"This is clearly unconstitutional. Many of us have been injured."
Videos posted on social media show soldiers pushing lawmakers out of the building. A few politicians appear to have been injured.
"There is no better symbol of Yameen's dictatorship than the image of his security forces barring elected MPs from parliament. This president has lost all legitimacy and credibility," said Eva Abdulla, an opposition lawmaker from the Maldivian Democratic Party.
The army could not be reached for comment.
Yameen has arrested or forced into exile most of the opponents who might have challenged him in next year's presidential elections.
Last year, an Al Jazeera investigation revealed how Yameen's government embezzled millions of dollars in tourism revenue. 
The embattled president now faces a coalition of four opposition parties, led by his brother Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who ruled the Maldives with an iron fist for 30 years, and Mohamed Nasheed, the country's first democratically elected president.
Faris Maumoon, Yameen's nephew and the leader of the effort to impeach the speaker, was arrested on charges of bribery last week.
Two other lawmakers were put on trial on charges of bribery and terrorism.

MR writes to Mahasanga on OMP
	
Days after President Maithripala Sirisena signed the Office of Missing Persons Act, former president Mahinda Rajapaksa has written to the Mahasanga saying this was one of several institutions the yahapalana government had agreed to set up to deal with the past in terms of the UNHRC Resolution 30/1 of October 14, 2015.
Under section 13(1)(i) of the Act, the information gathered by the OMP can be referred to the relevant law enforcement or prosecuting authorities, he said in the statement.
Even though the body to be set up under this law is referred to as an office, Section 12 of the OMP Act makes it clear that it will in actual fact be a tribunal which can receive complaints, carry out investigations, examine witnesses, issue summons and hold hearings. Its officers can enter without warrant at any time of the day or night any police station, prison or military installation and seize any document or object they require. Anyone who fails or refuses to cooperate with the OMP may be punished as if it were an act of contempt against the Court of Appeal.
Section 21 of the Act empowers the OMP to receive funding from any source local or foreign. Hence this body can receive funding from foreign governments, international NGOs and even from pro-LTTE Diaspora organisations that have not been banned.
Section 12 (c) (iii) of the Act allows the OMP to admit as evidence any statement or material disregarding all criteria laid down in the Evidence Ordinance. Disregarding the Evidence Ordinance will result in the common safeguards available even to the accused in ordinary criminal courts in this country being denied to those brought before the OMP.
Under Section 12(e) of the Act, all government bodies including the armed forces and intelligence services have to submit all required information and documents to the OMP even in contravention of the Official Secrets Act.
According to Section 15 of the Act, no court, not even the Supreme Court can order officers of the OMP to submit to courts any material communicated to them in confidence. The provisions of the Right to Information Act will also not apply to the Office of Missing Persons.
Under Section 25 of the Act, all officers of the OMP have been granted complete immunity from civil and criminal liability for any act or omission on their part or the contents of any report they may publish. Nothing that the OMP does can be called into question by any court of law except the Supreme Court under Articles 126 and 140 of the constitution. However, as the OMP can withhold information under Section 15 of the Act, there will be no practical use in moving even the Supreme Court against the OMP.

Number of LG members will double: Minister
	
Number of members elected to 336 Local Government bodies under the new electoral system will be doubled while the number of Local Government bodies will be increased by one Pradeshiya Sabha the Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha said yesterday.
Accordingly the number of members to be elected to the Municipal Councils, Urban Councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas is to be increased to 8,825 from the current 4,486, and the new number of Local Government bodies will be 336.
Under the newly introduced Local Government Electoral (Amendment) Act no. 22 of 2012 more than 2,200 women members representing 25% of the total number of elected members are expected to be elected and a new Pradeshiya Sabha will be established at Millennia.
I expect party leaders will approve the amendments to the Act at the next session of Parliament enabling the government to conduct Local Government polls in this year. We will have to go for the polls before November as the Elections Department is scheduled to conduct GCE O/L examination during this time. The Elections Department also needs a minimum 65 days to conduct polls since the Gazetting of the Local Government election, Minister Musthapha added.
The delimitation commission report released in August 2015 following passing of the Act in 2012 was full of errors, mistakes and inconsistencies and was vehemently opposed by minority parties as well as the SLFP and the UNP. If we are to conduct Local Government polls under the new electoral system, we should have first rectified the blunders that had been made by the Delimitation Commission in addition to finalizing the marking of boundaries of Local Government bodies. That is why I appointed the five member official committee headed by Asoka Peiris to look into the issue with the consent of all political parties, Minister Musthapha emphasized.
If the government postponed the Local Government polls accordingly, the elections to 23 Municipal Councils, 41 Urban Councils and 272 Pradeshiya Sabhas will have to be held on a same day as all current Local Government bodies numbering 335 would have completed their term of office by then.
Many Local Government bodies completed their term of office on March, 31, 2015, some others on July 31st of that year and few others on October 16, 2015. Another few Local Government bodies completed their term of office on August 24, 2013 and they are being run under special commissioners or Secretaries.
All Local Government bodies in the Western Province, including the Colombo, Kotte- Sri Jayewardenepura, Dehivala  Mt. Lavinia, Negombo and Gampaha completed five year term on October. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Pan Asia Bank offers ultimate low interest credit card solutions
	
Following the directive of the Central Bank to lift the maximum interest rate cap on credit cards, Pan Asia Bank DGM Marketing and Personal Banking Nalaka Wijayawardana shared his views on the way forward for Pan Asia Bank credit cards and how the bank plans to fulfill the role as the Understanding Bank in midst of the recent developments.
Could you tell us more about the journey Pan Asia Bank has embarked on over the last 2 decades
Within a short span of two years, we have successfully established ourselves in the hearts of our customers as a bank that understands their true needs. Further solidifying this perception Pan Asia Bank in 2015 decided to change its brand promise to be the Understanding Bank. Staying true to this promise, we have been able to understand and anticipate the needs of our valued customers and provide innovative solutions to meet their requirements in all spheres of banking.
How has your product development strategy contributed towards the banks overall brand promise
In view of understanding the customer needs, we have come up with many a novel product such as Sammana, a loan scheme for retired pensioners, Suwasavi a deposit product providing a free family medical insurance cover and the Champions saver deposit scheme that provides the flexibility of a savings account and gives the high interest rates of a Fixed Deposit. In future also, we will continue to focus on developing new products to meet the customer needs.
Your retail products have indeed been highly successful pertaining to the objective of establishing your bank as the Understanding Bank. How successful have your credit card facilities been in achieving this
Pan Asia Bank currently offers three different credit card types catering to different segments in the market and we pride ourselves as a bank offering some of the lowest industry interest rates ranging from 19.75 percent for Pan Asia Black MasterCard, 21.75 percent for Pan Asia Gold MasterCard and 24.00 percent for Pan Asia World MasterCard. This low interest proposition has been well accepted by the market and our market share has grown substantially from being less than 0.5 percent in 2013 to around 4.0 percent in the current quarter. These figures showcase how successful we have been in overcoming the challenges presented to us as a midsized bank operating in a highly competitive industry. Instead of being limited by these challenges, we have capitalized on our main forte which is innovating novel products that align with the customer requirements.
Recently, the Central Bank announced its decision to lift the ceiling on interest rates. Following this, many banks have now declared that they will charge an interest rate of around 28.00 percent. In light of these changes, what will be the strategy for Pan Asia Bank
We do understand that due to the increasing cost of funds, banks need the space to revisit their lending rates. However, as a bank that takes pride in positioning itself as the Understanding Bank, we are trying our level best to minimize the difficulties faced by customers due to rate increases. Hence, with regard to our credit cards, in spite of having the ceiling on interest rates uplifted, we are staying true to our brand of promise and keeping our cards as low interest credit cards although that is going to cost us an additional profit opportunity. Therefore, we will continue to operate as a low interest credit card and take every measure to ease the burden on our customers in light of these changes.
Does this mean customers can continue to avail your Balance Transfer arrangements at a lower rate than what your competitor banks are offering 
Certainly. This is exactly what our proposition is. In fact, customers can still transfer their other bank credit card balances to a Pan Asia Bank credit card at a rate as low as 16.0 percent. We will continue to offer the best value for our customers in terms of attractive seasonal promotions and special discounts whilst at the same time enjoying the benefits of the lowest interest rates in the market. Pertaining to the increased interest rates, our Balance Transfer facility is expected to ease 40.0 percent off on their interest charges. Further, our Balance Transfer Installment Plans allow the cardholders to pay off their accumulated credit card debt in full over specific time period under the lowest of interest rates.
Can you elaborate more on the benefits that are offered to your customers through the Bank Transfer Facility
Our Balance Transfer facility is designed in such that our cardholders can transfer their existing credit card balances to Pan Asia Bank credit card without additional charges. They can then decide to pay off the amount in either specific monthly installments or in varying monthly amounts that suits their monthly cash flows. Either way, our customers are given the opportunity to settle the credit card debts under a significantly lower interest rate.
Can you explain the application procedure for this facility
In order to apply, customers can simply visit their nearest Pan Asia Bank Branch and submit a completed Balance Transfer application along with a Pan Asia Bank Credit Card application as well as the required support documents including the latest credit card statements.

33 per cent of worlds child brides are in India
	

New Delhi, (Hindustan Times) - 
India contributes 33 per cent of the total number of child brides in the world with nearly 103 million Indians married before they were 18, said a report released on Friday. 
An estimated 85.2 million of the 103 million were girls, said the ActionAid India report, Eliminating Child Marriage in India: Progress And Prospects, released by actor-activist Shabana Azmi. 
At 103 million, the number of child marriages is more than the total population of Philippines (100 million) and Germany (80.68 million), stated the report, analysing data from Census 2011. 
Of every 28 girl child marriages occurring per minute in the world, more than two take place in India. Elimination of girl child marriages can help avoid 27,000 neonatal deaths, 55,000 infant deaths and 1,60,000 child deaths, it said.

Power failure in Colombo and suburbs: CEB
	
The incidents of power failure reported in Colombo and the suburbs this evening was due to electricity load balancing to demand and not because of a breakdown, Power and Renewable Energy Ministry Director (Development) Sulakshana Jayawardena said.
He said the load balancing (peak demand reserve refers to the use of various techniques by electrical power stations to store excess electrical power during low demand periods for release as demand rises) had to be done to the grid due to the high demand of its use.
From 6.30 p.m to 10.30 p.m, the system indicates the high demand of electricity usage of 2300 mega watts to 2400 megawatts. Due to the high demand, it had to be pushed up with more electricity to the system. Therefore for several hours some areas experienced an interruption in electricity supply, Mr. Jayawardena said.
He said Maharagama, Nugegoda, Dehiwala, Rajagiriya, Matara and Kalutara were reported as the affected areas.
During electricity load balancing, one 150 megawatt power phase of the Kerawalapitiya power station and the AES Kelanitissa Power Station which was known as a privately owned facility of 168 MW diesel fuel fired combined cycle power station, had also malfunctioned.
However the workers took measures to restore the power supply in those areas. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

SimpleCRM to revolutionize banking, financial and insurance landscape
	
Comprehensive and an affordable customer relationship management (CRM) software founded by a passionate and one of the most experienced CRM teams in Asia, SimpleCRM, recently started delivering its solutions to the Sri Lankan banking, financial services and insurance industry.
SimpleCRM aims to be the No. 1 CRM alternative to Salesforce.com or Microsoft CRM for the mid-enterprise and large enterprise market segments in the Asia Pacific, whilst helping the organisations to last longer with customer retention. Owned by Simpleworks Business Solutions Pte Ltd, SimpleCRM is capable of managing the customer relationships better and is an enterprise grade, highly scalable, comprehensive and cost-effective CRM of choice for large enterprises in the Asian price-sensitive market. Many renowned large organisations with thousands of CRM users are already using SimpleCRM software for managing their sales, digital marketing and customer support operations. In Sri Lanka too, SimpleCRM is deployed at Union Assurance PLC and also as a pilot project at one of the largest banks in Sri Lanka. With an experience of delivering 300+ CRM projects over the last decade, the SimpleCRM team is one of the most experienced CRM teams in Asia.
According to the SimplCRM officials, the recent global economic conditions have brought a dramatic impact to the banking, financial services and insurance industry and as a result, a record shift in consumer behaviour now demands a compensating shift in this sector. Large financial write-downs, a much more volatile market and increased economic uncertainty have resulted in financial services companies being pushed to more conservative business principals and placing a greater focus on the existing customer relationships.
In a parallel scale the rise of consumer technologies such as mobile, social media and cloud have empowered the consumers with on-demand information, real-time collaboration with other consumers and vetted customer opinions of financial services products, policy comparisons, service experiences and a host of factors, which the consumers use to determine what policy to purchase or where to put their money. These changes in customer behaviour have created a perfect storm for the financial and insurance services organisations as the customer expectations are growing at rapid rate. The officials from the SimpleCRM added that todays customers of any product are readily sharing their bad experiences publicly and the customers are switching their providers at a dramatically increased pace.
Therefore, all financial services companies need to devise a strategy of their own, which achieves increased efficiencies and greater customer focus and results in lower operating costs, better information, increased customer share and reduced customer agitation.
Under these circumstances, the companies need to switch to CRM systems to achieve these operational and information system requirements. Using CRM systems to consolidate multiple lines of business information to achieve a holistic view of the customers information, portfolio and household delivers insightful up-sell and cross-sell opportunities. Further, when the sales, marketing and customer support business processes are automated using the CRM software, the cycle times are dramatically lowered and the user productivity increases.

SL to extend India's Ramayana circuit: Minister
	
Sri Lanka is preparing to be part of the Ramayana circuit planned by India for tourists, the Deccan Herald reported today quoting Tourism Development Minister John Amaratunga.
The Indian government is identifying places connected with the Ramayana, while Sri Lanka has already identified 71 locations across the island for inclusion in the circuit, the news article said.
The Ramayana describes how Sita, Ramas wife, is kidnapped by Ravana and taken away to Sri Lanka. Hanuman then launches a grand operation building a stone bridge across the sea to rescue her.
Minister Amaratunga has told Deccan Herald that Sri Lanka has appointed a committee to identify more places.
He was speaking on the sidelines of the 99th edition of the India International Travel Mart, organised by Sphere Travelmedia and Exhibition, which concluded on Sunday.
He said the government had entered into an agreement with the Indian government to create a full circuit.
We are closely working with various Indian state governments to link all places. The two countries share a 5,000-year-old relationship, he said.
Excavation is on for more places described in the Ramayana. "We aim to complete the entire circuit by the end of this year. Just like Prime Minister Narendra Modi, we look at Sri Lanka and all south Indian states as one unique unit, housing the maximum Ramayana spots, he said.
The two governments are also working closely on the Buddhist circuit. The spots Buddha visited in Sri Lanka are not well known, said V. Krishnamoorthy, Deputy High Commissioner, Sri Lanka.
He said Sita stayed at Sita Vyasa in Sri Lanka, and was taken to Ussangoda. More than 320,000 tourists from south India visited Sri Lanka last year and a similar number of Sri Lankans visited India, he said.

A doctors perspective of present-day practice of medicine in Sri Lanka
I was listening to the radio Corrupt specialist doctor got caught while taking bribes. This story went viral on social media. The radio station gave the full story of his behaviour with evidence. It was a shame to the whole of medical profession that prompted me to write about medical ethics. I sat down with a book titled great traditions in ethics. Suddenly I saw some nurses and a young doctor running towards a patient, there was a sudden cardiac (heart) arrest. The doctor without thinking twice started resuscitating the patient. The poor old patients clothes were soiled with faecal matter, vomit and saliva. 
The smell was unbearable. The young doctor was resuscitating even without gloves. I saw his tie, shirt and the trouser all stained with the secretions from the patient. The doctor quickly cannulated the patient and restarted his care up to the maximum with pouring sweat. After everything was over, he went to the tap, to see he needs to take a bath. Unfortunately he cannot leave the ward. I slowly started my conversation with him. 
Its faeces, vomit and saliva on your hands; you need to take a bath, isnt it 
Its ok, I used to work with my father in his paddy field in the mud and in the hot sun, and Im used to it. 
The both these doctors were products of free education in Sri Lanka. The first specialist as far as I know has come with flying colours in undergraduate and postgraduate examinations. 
When it comes to SAITM issue, where do I stand was with the universal declaration of Human Rights -Article 26. 


Everyone has the right to education. Education shall be free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stage. Elementary education shall be compulsory. Technical and professional education shall be made generally available and higher education shall be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit. 
Education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
We think we have a fair, just and transparent system of merit to enter into medical schools-though our district quota system has its limitations. When I entered the university, I felt it was the power of cramming and memorising that they checked at the examinations. 
Although medicine is based on facts, the exercising of these facts requires articulate thinking, balance and judgement, which are informed by ethical considerations. 
An individual wishing to become a healthcare professional has to learn the principles by which the profession works. For healthcare, these include many fundamental issues in philosophy such as humanity, personhood, relationships and society, as well as morality and regulation. 
Medicine is unique in many ways, dealing as it does quite literally with matters of life and death. Even if the gravity of this is recognised, it is and will remain a fallible practice. 
To expect doctors to never make mistakes, while at the same time acknowledging, that to err is human, appears to be logically inconsistent. 
Lord Justice Nourse once said Of all sciences, medicine is one of the least exact. Others have suggested that it is overly simplistic to regard medicine simply as a science, suggesting instead that it is a discrete discipline that draws on many others. 


The Law of Hippocrates states Medicine is of all the arts the most noble, but, owing to the ignorance of those who practice it and of those who inconsiderately, form a respect by all men, in all times but should I trespass and violate this oath, may the reverse be my lot 
In Canada, at graduation, civil engineers are given a ring to wear throughout their lives. The metal from which these rings are made comes from a bridge which collapsed, causing many deaths. 
By way of analogy, doctors who forget the fundamental ethical principles to which they subscribe at graduation will be liable to cause unnecessary suffering, and even death. 
In our professional lives as doctors, we will regularly encounter problems that require us to make difficult decisions. There will be times when we are not certain what the best choice of action ought to be. There are times when our own choices, beliefs and values do not coincide with those of others. Such conflicts will arise with colleagues, other professionals, superiors, accepted guidelines and most significantly with patients. 
Ordinarily, we tend to rely on our own intuitions and beliefs to settle these problems, but when conflicts arise they may be counterproductive to fall back on these very beliefs that are causing the conflict in the first place. Thus we require other approaches for decision making. 
Science can not address all the problems encountered in healthcare. There are issues that must be covered by the Art of Medicine. 


The three rules i.e., laws, professional codes and guidelines, the principles and theories of ethics can be recruited to assist our own natural decision making abilities, which include common sense, personal beliefs and the factual scientific knowledge. 
As it stands today, we have no absolutes for handling difficult decisions, there are no clear signposts and there is no unequivocal way. If we did have formula answers for them, the decisions wouldnt be difficult. 
Finally I would like to highlight a part of oath and Law of Hippocrates, 
Whoever is to acquire a competent knowledge of medicine, ought to be possessed of the following advantages: a natural disposition, instruction; a favourable position for the study, early tuition; love of labour; leisure. 
First of all, a natural talent is required, for when nature leads the way to what is most excellent, instruction in the art takes place, which the student must try to appropriate to himself by reflection, becoming an early pupil in a place well adapted for instruction. He must also bring to the task a love of labour and perseverance, so that the instruction taking root may bring forth proper and abundant fruits. 
Having brought all these requisites to the study of medicine, and having acquired a true knowledge of it, we shall thus in travelling through the cities, be esteemed physicians not only in name but in reality. Those things which are sacred are to be imparted only to sacred persons, and it is not lawful to impart them to the profane until they have been initiated into the mysteries of the science.

Where do I stand......


	When it comes to SAITM issue, where do I stand was with the universal declaration of Human Rights -Article 26. 
	
	
	Education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
	
	
	We think we have a fair, just and transparent system of merit to enter into medical schools-though our district quota system has its limitations. 
	
	
	Although medicine is based on facts, the exercising of these facts requires articulate thinking, balance and judgement, which are informed by ethical considerations. 
	
	
	An individual wishing to become a healthcare professional has to learn the principles by which the profession works. 
	
	
	Medicine is unique in many ways, dealing as it does quite literally with matters of life and death. Even if the gravity of this is recognised, it is and will remain a fallible practice. 
	
	
	In Canada, at graduation, civil engineers are given a ring to wear throughout their lives. The metal from which these rings are made comes from a bridge which collapsed, causing many deaths. 
	
	
	In our professional lives as doctors, we will regularly encounter problems that require us to make difficult decisions. 
	
	
	Ordinarily, we tend to rely on our own intuitions and beliefs to settle these problems, but when conflicts arise they may be counterproductive to fall back on these very beliefs that are causing the conflict in the first place. Thus we require other approaches for decision making. 
	
	
	Science can not address all the problems encountered in healthcare. There are issues that must be covered by the Art of Medicine. 
	
	
	As it stands today, we have no absolutes for handling difficult decisions, there are no clear signposts and there is no unequivocal way. If we did have formula answers for them, the decisions wouldnt be difficult.

Trudeau reiterates need for accountability mechanism in SL
	
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau yesterday reiterated that Sri Lanka should establish a process of accountability that will gain the trust and the confidence of the victims of the war.
Issuing a statement on the anniversary of Black July, Prime Minister Trudeau said Canadians join Canadians of Tamil descent and members of the Tamil community to commemorate the 34th anniversary of the events of Black July.
As we pause to reflect on the dark days of the Sri Lankan Civil War, we must continue to work to heal the wounds of all those who suffered. We welcome international efforts underway to achieve long-term reconciliation and peace for all Sri Lankans, but we reiterate the need to establish a process of accountability that will have the trust and the confidence of the victims of this war, he said.
The Premier said Canadas cultural diversity is one of their greatest strengths and sources of pride.
As we mark the 150th anniversary of Confederation, let us take the time to recognize the contributions of all who have made Canada their home regardless of their cultural, religious or linguistic backgrounds. On behalf of the Government of Canada, I extend my deepest sympathy and support to all those who have suffered immeasurable loss during the Sri Lankan Civil War, he said.
He said anti-Tamil pogroms were carried out in Colombo and other parts of Sri Lanka resulting in thousands of deaths and the displacement of countless victims between July 24 and 29 in 1983.
