A wreath sent with a wrong condolence tag on it
	
An occupant of an important chair in the Diyawanna council had sent an expensive wreath to a funeral parlour in Borella to convey his condolences on the death of a lady who had been very close to him.?
The valet of the Diyawanna bigwig who carried the wreath to the funeral parlour had discovered that the tag put on the wreath mistakenly carried the name of the mother of a leading singer as the departed.
Finding that it was too late to undo the gaffe already made, the valet had quietly left the place. ?

1,200cc Ducati bike seized
	
A high-end, high powered motorcycle worth over Rs.4 million, which had been smuggled into the country under the patronage of the son of a former VVIP during the previous regime, was seized by the police from a place where it was hidden in Keselwatta, yesterday.
The Colombo Central Divisional Law Enforcement Unit had raided a room on Silversmith Lane off Abdul Hameed Street, which was said to have been a secret hideout used by underworld operatives.
Police had raided the place after receiving information that it was used by underworld operatives as a meeting place and to do drugs. Police had never expected to find an Italian made black coloured Ducati with an engine capacity of 1,200 cc. parked inside.
A man was arrested on the spot and he had told the police that the expensive motorcycle had been given to him as a gift by one of his friends -- a clearing agent who had died sometime ago.
According to police sources, the suspect and his acquaintances had been riding the motorcycle, which cannot be legally ridden on the local roads as its engine capacity is above the legal limit.
Inquiries had revealed that the motorcycle had neither been registered with the Department of Motor Traffic nor brought in to the country with the knowledge of the Sri Lanka Customs.
Police been told that the motorcycle had been smuggled into the country through illegal channels under the patronage of the former VVIP?s son.
Under the prevailing motor traffic laws, clearance from the Ministry of Defence is required to import such high capacity motorcycles, and then too only for riding on race tracks.
Police are conducting further inquiries to discover how the motorcycle was smuggled in and how it ended up with the suspect.
Police, however, had found that the suspect had no criminal record. He was produced before the Maligakanda Magistrate yesterday and remanded.
Colombo Central Divisional Law Enforcement Unit OIC, CI Janak De Silva is conducting investigations, instructed by Senior DIG (Western Province) Nandana Munasinghe, DIG Colombo Lalith Pathinayake, SSP Central Division Saliya de Silva and SP Sanjaya Irasinghe. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

Close down SAITM: JVP
	
In fresh disclosures on the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM), the JVP today alleged that the private medical college had bribed some of the members of the sub-committee appointed by the oversight committee which recommended that it should be converted into a public-private partnership.
The committee report was submitted to Parliament earlier this month.
JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake told a media briefing last morning that some of the sub-committee members had accepted monetary gifts from the SAITM management and that close relatives of several MPs in Parliament were studying there.
He pointed out that at least six senior dons teaching in the school had not passed their medical degrees and SAITM's Medical Director who was qualified aboard had not passed the ACT 16 exam. "Against this background how can he hold such a post," the MP asked adding that the qualifications of school?s clinical coordinator were also questionable because the Australian Medical Council had cancelled his registration.
?Despite the Sri Lanka Medical Council repeatedly stating that SAITEM is illegal, the former higher education minister S.B. Dissanayake had blundered by issuing two gazette notifications giving degree-awarding status to SAITEM. Mr Dissanayake originally issued two gazette notifications in September 2013 -- one issued in the morning giving degree-awarding status from 2013 while he issued another gazette notification on the same day giving degree-awarding status to SAITM from 2011,? the MP said.?Under these circumstances we urge the government to close down SAITM similar to what Bangladesh did to its Science and Technology University.?
He said his party would launch another protest campaign against SAITM shortly. (Yohan Perera)

Evacutions resume in E. Aleppo: 350 people leave rebel-held area
	
?
Some 350 people were able to leave a rebel-held pocket of east Aleppo on Sunday, a medical official said, despite the official postponement of evacuations of civilians and fighters from the devastated Syrian city. ??
Dozens of buses had entered Aleppo earlier in the day to resume evacuations, but plans were called off at the last minute after gunmen attacked vehicles for a similar operation from two rebel-besieged villages. ??
The development came as the UN Security Council prepared to vote on a resolution to deploy observers to the city, with Syria-allied Russia giving cautious backing to the measure. ?
? ?Five buses carrying the evacuees arrived from besieged parts of east Aleppo,? said Ahmad al-Dbis, who heads a team of doctors and volunteers co-ordinating evacuations to rebel-held Khan al-Assal.. ??
??They were in a terrible state,? Dbis told AFP. ??
??They hadn?t eaten, they had nothing to drink, the children had caught colds, they were not even able to go to the toilet,? he added. ??
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the 350 were able to be evacuated after Russia and Turkey urged the Syrian regime to allow the convoy of buses to pass its final control point. ??
Evacuations were suspended on Friday, a day after convoys of people had begun leaving the rebel sector under a deal allowing the regime to take full control of the battleground city. ??

LET US CHANGE THE MINDSET BEFORE CHANGING LAWS
	
A public seminar was held recently to celebrate the 68th International Human Rights Day. Titled ?Let us change the mindset before changing laws?, the panel of speakers consisted of experts in constitutional law, human rights and women?s affairs. The speakers mainly focused on making a people?s constitution that addresses the problems they faced so there would not be a recurrence of further strife threatening national unity and reconciliation. Stressing that human rights could be safeguarded through constitutional reform, the speakers voiced their opinion on the abolition of the executive presidency, devolution and the need for a referendum to establish the new constitution.?
?The executive presidency has been an obstacle to establish democracy?
J.C. Weliamuna- Human Rights Lawyer
Stressing the importance of abolishing the executive presidency, Human Rights lawyer and former Executive Director of Transparency International Sri Lanka, J.C.Weliamuna said that power over the state and judiciary had been vested with one person or a group of people in the prevalent presidential system. Referring to the unexpected defeat of Yahya Jammeh, the dictator who ruled Gambia for 22 years he said, ?These kind of experiences differ according to countries. But it?s important to draw lessons from these experiences to prevent the system from falling onto the path of dictatorship. In this respect, abolishing the executive presidency is one pre-condition.? ??
He noted that there have been hopeful signs of the abolition. ?The sub-committee report reflects that there is immense improvement. There is a 38-page report on the field of human rights. This report is in accordance with international standards and is something we?ve not seen in past constitutions. For instance, there are explanations as to what civil political rights and social economic politics are,? he said. ??
Stating that the abolition of the executive presidency did not solve all the issues in countries, he added it would prevent power from being misused to fulfill personal aspirations. ?The executive presidency has been an obstacle to establishing democracy,? he added. ??
He said the discourse on human rights which was previously limited to civil societies had now become a topic of discussion within the government. ??
?
?
?It?s important to move back to the parliament democracy we had before 1972?
Dr. PakiasothySaravanamuttu- Executive Director at Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA)
?This is the second year in which we are able to celebrate International Human Rights day in different circumstances to what we have faced in the past. We mustn?t fall into the trap- and I use that word deliberately- into thinking in the same way as we did before. We need to acknowledge that change, understand that change and recognize what that change entails,? said Dr. Pakiasothy Saravanamuttu, the Executive Director at Centre for Policy Alternatives(CPA). ??
Noting that the programme of the yahapalanaya government was defined by liberal civil society and was presented during a course of two and a half decades under inhospitable circumstances, he said, ?It?s our programme and therefore we are challenged as to whether we have a special responsibility to ensure the programme is realised, if not in full measure, in substantive measure.? ? ?I don?t think we have the license or the liberty to sit on the sidelines and criticise.We have to engage in a critical and constructive engagement with the government on the basis of shared values and common objectives,? he said. ??
Referring to the consequences of the executive presidency, he said, ?We have come into a political culture which is fundamentally antidemocratic and fundamentally problematic in terms of the deficit in the government and especially in the emerging ethnic conflict.? ??
?One of the arguments J.R. Jayawardane of the UNP made in the 1970s was that we need a strong executive to ensure uninterrupted and smooth economic development. But interestingly, after the executive presidency was set up, there was an insurgency in the South and a civil war which went on for three decades,? he said ??
?If we are to move towards a constitutional architecture which meets the aspirations of all our people and addressed their grievances, we have to be able to diffuse power,? he said, adding that there should not be a single office relatively immune to checks and balances. ??
?That is why it?s important to move back to the parliament democracy we had before 1972, and not after 1972,? he said, emphasizing the need to end the debate on the executive presidency which has been going on for the past three decades. ??
?
?
?We have reached the utmost limit in terms of reforming the executive presidency.?
Niran Anketell- Expert in Constitutional Law?
Speaking about threats posed to the process to evolve a new constitution, Niran Anketell, Attorney-at-law and expert in constitutional law, said the primary threat was that necessary constitutional amendments could be effected without a referendum through piecemeal reform. ??
He said those who questioned the need for a referendum referred to the referenda that took place during the course of 2016. This includes the referenda in the UK with Brexit, in Colombia with the peace plans and with the constitutional referendum in Italy. ?They believe that referenda gives power to the racist. Therefore, the general argument is that Sri Lanka should not have a referendum and we should attempt to make constitutional reform through piecemeal legislation and in a way that does not attract the referendum provisions in the constitution,? he added. ??
Raising the question as to what can and cannot be done with a referendum, he said, ?There are two significant cases in the Supreme Court that answer this question decisively. The first and the most recent is the 19th amendment determination. When the 19th amendment was brought to parliament, the Supreme Court weighed in the question. The Supreme Court found that certain clauses in the 19th amendment require a referendum and they decided certain clauses did not. It?s fairly clear that it would be very difficult to further reduce the powers of the presidency without a referendum. Any further attempt to dilute presidential powers, any further attempt to set Sri Lanka on a trajectory back to the pre 1972 constitutional structure would in all likelihood require a referendum.? ??
?
?
?We need a constitution that dispels gender based discrimination.? ??
Sumika Perera- Women?s Rights Activist
?We need a constitution that dispels gender-based discrimination. The existing constitution states there should be no discrimination based on gender. But practically speaking, this does not happen. Women are constantly harassed,? said Sumika Perera, a women?s rights activist who functions as the coordinator of the Women?s Resource Centre. ??
?Women and the disabled have been included in the same clause in the constitution. There can be groups which have special needs. But the very fact that women have been categorized in this manner reflects the place of a woman,? she added. ??
Stating that women were permitted to suggest proposals with regard to the new constitution she added that along with the ?Women and Media collective? she had visited 19 districts and obtained opinions from 22 groups of women. ?The Sinhalese, Tamil, and Muslim women and those of other races joined this endeavour. At the end, we gave our recommendations to the committee in writing.? ??
She added that women from all districts unanimously voiced assent for a new constitution that better suited the needs of the future. ??
She recollected an instance when a woman from Muthur expressed gratitude for being able to suggest a proposal. ?She said she felt she was a citizen of our country. She said that even if her recommendation is not carried out the chance of being able to propose her suggestion was itself a victory.? ??
She said that though certain rights had been established constitutionally, as they are not executed, there was a need for a special platform. ?Any woman has the right to join politics. But if there are no special opportunities women can?t receive equal treatment. Though Sri Lanka produced the world?s first prime minister, currently the representation of women in the parliament is not even 6%. But we have been able to achieve a 25% quota for local government which is gratifying.? ? ?She further added that religious extremist groups tried to control not only women?s opinions and political inclinations, but also their body. She noted that there was a challenge as to how women?s rights which include the right to a livelihood, food safety, social protection, to a house, and to land could be ensured. ??There was a thirty year war In the North. Women suffered immensely. They had to carry on their family and societal roles with arduous difficulties despite the absence of their husbands and children who had gone to join warring factions,? she said emphasizing the need for a safe society where people were not burdened by the fear of disappearances or conflict. ??

Madras High Court bans Sharia courts in TN
	
The Madras High Court on Monday directed the Tamil Nadu government to ban all unauthorised 'Sharia' courts functioning on premises of mosques in the state while hearing a petition of a man who was allegedly forced to give talaq by one such court in the city.
The court today said that religious places were meant only for religious purposes and ordered the state government to ensure that such courts do not function and file a status report by January 19 - next hearing.
The Madras High Court passed the order after hearing a plea filed by Abdur Rahman, a non-resident Indian from the UK, stating that a large number of innocent Muslims were suffering because of the functioning of 'Makkah Masjid Sharia Council' in Chennai and similar forums across Tamil Nadu that were functioning like judicial forums.
Mr Rahman, who sought a direction to stop the functioning of Makkah Masjid Sharia Council, said he had approached the Sharia council to reunite with his wife, but was forced by the council to sign a letter of Talaq. He however has now approached the family court for an appropriate remedy.
Though the Supreme Court has declared such bodies as illegal, the number of disputes entertained by such Sharia councils exceed a few hundred every year, the plea said.
Mr Rahman, in his plea, contended that such "kangaroo courts" deceptively dissolve marriages of many and even deal with property disputes and creates a sense of religious fear in the mind of Muslims for any disobedience.
The court observed that such places of worship - whether it be temple, mosque or church -? when used as extra-judicial forums, certainly the authorities are duty bound to take action against them. (ndtv)

Malaysia Foreign Minister Anifah Aman (L) arrives to attend ASEAN Foreign Minister Meeting for Rohingya issue.
?
REUTERS, 19th DECEMBER, 2016- Malaysia said on Monday the plight of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar was a regional concern and called for the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) to coordinate humanitarian aid and investigate alleged atrocities committed against them.
Malaysian Foreign Minister Anifah Aman was speaking at a meeting of the 10-nation bloc in Yangon called by Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi after weeks of reports that the army has killed, raped and arbitrarily arrested Rohingya civilians.
Myanmar has denied the accusations, saying many of the reports are fabricated, and it insists the strife in Rakhine State, where many Rohingya live, is an internal matter.
In addition to fending off diplomatic pressure over the crisis, the Myanmar government has also invited a handpicked media delegation to visit the affected region this week.

Namal asks why MDMK leader opposed to laws protecting SL fishermen
	
Namal Rajapaksa, Sri Lankan parliamentarian and son of the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, has asked why MarumalarchiDravidaMunnetraKazhagam (MDMK) leader Vaiko opposed laws that seek to protect Sri Lankan Tamil fishermen, The Hindu reported.
?#Vaiko claims to speak on behalf of Tamil people. Then why oppose laws that protect livelihoods of #SriLanka Tamil fishermen? @narendramodi,? the young parliamentarian, who Mr. Rajapaksa considers his political heir, tweeted on Monday; days after Mr. Vaiko addressed a protest rally in Rameswaram.
Sri Lanka?s Fisheries Ministry is considering imposing steep fines, of up to Rs. 7 crore, on foreign vessels trespassing into its territorial waters.
Addressing Tamil Nadu fishermen recently, Mr. Vaiko had said the proposed law, expected to come into effect in early 2017, would ?crush? the livelihoods of Tamil Nadu fishermen. He urged Prime Minister NarendraModi to pressure Sri Lanka against introducing such a law.
Contentious issue
The fisheries conflict between Sri Lankan and Indian fishermen has remained a contentious issue between the neighbours. Bottom trawlers originating from Tamil Nadu fish in the Palk Bay, a narrow strait between south-eastern coast of India along Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka?s Tamil-majority north, often crossing into Sri Lankan waters.
The livelihood of nearly 2 lakh Tamils across Sri Lanka?s war-torn Northern Province is tied to the sea ? fisheries and agriculture being two key sectors of their rural economy. Sri Lankan fishermen have repeatedly observed that while they value the solidarity expressed by their Tamil Nadu counterparts through the years of war and later, the State needed to appreciate their right to livelihood.
Following recurring complaints from Sri Lankan fishermen, leaders from both sides of the Palk Bay have met multiple times since 2010, only to find negotiations turn futile.
The Sri Lankan Navy continues arresting Indian fishermen on charges of engaging in illegal fishing, and apprehends the trawlers. In 2016, 254 Indian fishermen were arrested and 46 trawlers seized. Since 2014, Sri Lanka has been releasing the arrested fishermen swiftly, but has retained the seized trawlers, now numbering close to 150.
Marginal decrease
Following this, Sri Lanka has observed a marginal decrease in the number of Indian trawlers spotted in its waters.
Early November, Foreign and Fisheries Ministers of India and Sri Lanka met in New Delhi to discuss the issue. India acknowledged the need to phase out bottom-trawling, a destructive fishing method that threatens marine biodiversity, and the two countries have decided to meet regularly, through a Joint Working Group.
The next meeting is scheduled for January.

Retired Banker uses maths skill to uplift Tamil Children?s theatre
	
Mithrarathna Kanaththage, a retired banker, has introduced five new methods to solve the famous Theorem of Pythagoras recently. He presented his methods to the Kelaniya and Sri Jayawardhanepura Universities. There, they were tested by Maths professors and presented to the National Educational Institution at Maharagama and finally to the International Mathematical Council. The Pythagorean Theorem can be proven by more than 300 methods. Many mathematicians, including Greek philosopher Euclid, have found different ways to solve it since ancient times. ??
Mithraratne?s methods were presented to the Director of Education. Professionals under his service checked them and appreciated Mithrarathna?s efforts; they are now waiting for recognition by the International Mathematics Council. The new methods are expected to appear in Maths textbooks as well. ?His discoveries were demonstrated to Senior Lecturer, Sarath Kumara at the University of Sri Jayawardenapura, who confirmed his methods to be accurate. Mithrarane made this effort to raise funds for Tamil children?s drama activities, appalled by the injustice he witnessed at the Children?s State Drama Festival after 2013. Being a Sinhalese, Mithrarathna is dedicated to improving Tamil medium children?s stage plays in Sri Lanka. ??
Background ??
Mithrarathna studied in the Advanced Level maths stream and joined the People?s Bank, Colombo branch, at the time located at Lake House. As he was very talented with numbers, the bank employed him at the international division?s Foreign Exchange Unit. His passion, hobby and profession are numbers. ??
Other findings ??
By far, Mithrarathna has found 7 new maths methods, including 3 new ways to multiply. (He devised these systems to make maths easy for weaker students, as he believes the reason for the student?s weakness is their inability to do basic arithmetic.) ??
He has also introduced a new way to trisect an angle without using a protractor. ??
Dramatist ??
He received numerous awards for his dramas in Sinhala, Tamil and English at the State Children?s Drama Festival. Mithrarathna was among those who raised his voice on behalf of Tamil Children?s Drama, established and inaugurated in 2011. Mithrarathna is immensely interested in stage plays and has been writing and directing them for Sri Lankan, especially Tamil, children. ??
Mithrarathna had been attracted to drama and theatre since his school days. His debut drama was ?Achchi Mala?, staged when he was in Grade 7. ??
While working in the bank, he renewed his interest in drama and began to write plays. Many of his bank friends came to watch his dramas including Tamils, Muslims and Sinhalese. His Tamil friends asked him why there were no Tamil dramas and he began to work towards developing Tamil stage plays. ??
The history of Children?s Drama Festival and the Battle of 14 years ??
The State Drama Festival was begun in 1959 and since 1996, it has been held in two main sections as open section and limited section. Sinhala and English dramas were held but there was a void in Tamil drama. There was apparently no demand for a Tamil category at the State Drama Festival either. Mithrarathna took steps to end the discrimination first by establishing ?The moment to win Tamil Children?s State Drama Festival?. As President of that organization, he informed many officials, parliamentarians, the Drama Advisory Board, the State Arts Council and other relevant officials about this problem. First they asked for a separate Tamil Drama Festival but later the State Drama Panel decided to make The State Children?s Drama Festival tri-lingual by introducing Tamil and English sections. ??
They translated many Sinhalese stage plays into Tamil and these were staged by his drama association in Habarakada. During the first few years, Tamil participation was low and the Arts Council asked him to bring in Tamil scripts. He went to the North and East in search of Tamil scripts at his own expense and eventually returned with about 10?12 scripts. As the Tamil audience was still small, he travelled to the North and brought Tamil children to the theatre. They were motivated by his efforts and a surge in Tamil children?s drama took place. In 2012, he received 68 Tamil drama scripts. Mithraratne asks, ?What more proof do we need to show that unity can be achieved between various ethnicities in Sri Lanka than through stage dramas?? ??
In 2013, the State Children?s Drama Festival was held as planned and everything took place on time except the awards ceremony. Furious at this injustice, Mithrarathna informed the newspapers about this. Since then, he says his dramas had not been selected for awards and that Tamil dramas were not nominated for awards, either. He says the above activity was evident punishment to him for speaking out about the 2013 incident. ??
State Drama Council?s promise ??
The main reason for the negligence of the Tamil Drama awards was ?Lack of standards? according to the State Drama Council, Mithrarathna said. ??
?I asked what the standards were. In return, they promised to organize drama workshops for Tamil children and dramatists, publishing a guidebook for writing and directing dramas, but neither activity had a favourable outcome. For the first time in history, the President participated at the State Drama Awards in 2011 and awards were not given in the Tamil section as they weren?t deemed suitable. As the years passed, dramatists were ignored and they gave up hope regarding the drama festival, their sense of equality vanished and the State Tamil Children?s Drama Festival Section didn?t get the attention it deserved.? ??
Mr. Mithrarathna further said that although he informed a number of Ministers, Secretaries and officials regarding this situation, some officials gave positive feedback while some, including Tamil politicians, never cared. ??
Mithrarathna lives in Habarakada, where not a single Tamil family can be found, but he is struggling for the rights of Tamil children in Sri Lanka. ??

REUTERS, 19th DECEMBER, 2016
The foreign and defence ministers of Russia, Iran and Turkey will discuss the future of Syria and the city of Aleppo at talks in Moscow on Tuesday, Turkish and Russian officials said.
?(The meeting) will be to understand the views of all three sides, laying out where we all stand and discuss where we go from here,? an official from Turkey?s foreign ministry told international media in Istanbul on Monday.
?It is not a miracle meeting, but will give all sides a chance to listen to each other,? the official said.
All three countries have emerged as important players in Syria, with Iran and Russia strongly backing President Bashar al-Assad, while Turkey, a NATO member, would like to see him step down.
Turkey?s main priority however, is to ensure that Kurdish militias are unable to gain further territory in Syria along its borders.
The Russian Defence Ministry said in a statement Tuesday?s meeting would focus on how the multi-year conflict in Syria could be resolved and on fulfilling U.N. Security Council resolutions.

Transport Ministry to limit three wheeler imports
	
Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said yesterday that the ministry had decided to limit the importation of three-wheelers in future and to issue licences to drive three-wheelers only to persons above the age of 35 years.
While holding a discussion with several three-wheeler associations at the ministry, the minister said there were about 1.2 million three-wheelers in the country and new rules and regulations would be introduced regarding the transportation of passengers in three-wheelers.
Passenger transportation in three-wheelers was started at the end of the nineteen eighties and there were no laws to regulate the service, he said.
During the meeting the minister informed the three-wheeler associations of the new regulations -- and the associations had shared their ideas with him.
Nine main points had been discussed, and several proposals had been presented by the three-wheeler associations, including the raising of the speed limit from 40Km/hr to 50 Km/hr. The minister had promised to provide solutions after discussion with the police and other relevant institutions. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Travel-service counters at BIA: Successful bidders get nod to operate
	
Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry Secretary said today he had instructed Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Ltd Chairman to act in line with the court ruling and provide contracts to companies which have successfully tendered to operate travel-service counters at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA).
?I received the court ruling on Monday and I instructed the Chairman to award the contracts to selected companies with immediate effect? Ministry Secretary Nihal Somaweera said.
Tenders for travel-service counters which are for a three-year period were called on December 30, last year. The ministry had received 19 bids and had chosen the six highest bidders.
A source said the ministry had incurred a loss of Rs.60 million since March this year because of the delay in entering into contracts with the success travel companies.
The delay had resulted in the Airport and Aviation Services Ltd. which is under the purview of the ministry, to incur a loss of Rs.5.3 million a month.
The source said the companies now operating at the BIA had paid a total monthly rent of Rs.3.3 million, however, under the new tender requirement they had agreed to pay a total monthly rent of Rs.8.6 million.
None of the companies operating service counters had vacated their premises at the end of the previous agreement in February this year. Among the current batch of six companies, three had won their bids to continue operations and agreed to pay the increased rental but they were continuing to pay the previous rental.
The source said the ministry had informed the new bidders that the tender for 2016 had been cancelled in June, prompting legal action by the other three companies. The Court of Appeal had directed that the tender procedure be followed.
Mr. Somaweera said the delay was because several companies had appealed against the tender procedure.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

Ukraine leader urges calm after big bank nationalised
	
AFP - Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko urged people yesterday not to panic after his government nationalised the country?s largest private bank to avoid a rapid financial meltdown.
The former Soviet republic?s cabinet on Sunday took over PrivatBank -- a lender that held one-third of Ukrainians? bank deposits and even had branches in the Baltic states.
The bank was owned by billionaire and presidential foe Igor Kolomoyskiy. Yet the tycoon was widely reported to be heavily burdened by debts because of loans to select insiders and reliant on the state to stay afloat.
Kiev?s decision falls in line with the International Monetary Fund?s demand for Ukraine to clean up and stabilise its murky financial sector in order to achieve sustainable growth.
But it has created unease on the street about the future of people?s holdings and whether the country might enter another economic crisis similar to when Russia annexed Ukraine?s Crimea peninsula in March 2014.
A subsequent 31-month war with pro-Russia insurgents in the separatist east that has claimed nearly 10,000 lives saw the economy shrink by about 17 percent in 2014-15 and inflation soar to just under 50 percent last year.
The pro-Western Ukrainian leader said in a statement that the situation was under his full control.
?I appeal to you, dear PrivatBank clients -- keep calm,? Poroshenko said.
?The new (state) administration is already taking over the levers of power -- right now, this very hour and minute.?
Ukraine?s Central Bank had wanted Kolomoyskiy to refinance his bank with billions of dollars if he wanted to remain its owner.
There were fears that PrivatBank?s fall could have ignited a wider crisis in the financial system akin to the turbulence in the United States in 2008.
But the tycoon never came up with the money and Kiev?s patience snapped on Sunday.
Finance Minister Oleksandr Danyluk said the government?s decision ?will help preserve the savings of nearly 20 million PrivatBank clients.
?All of our international partners support this move, including the International Monetary Fund, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, as well as the government of the United States,? the finance minister said.
Ukrainian Central Bank chief Valeria Gontareva told reporters that PrivatBank had miserably failed a series of stress tests and was in a $4.2-billion (4.0-billion-euro) hole in April 2015.
She said 97 percent of the bank?s loans at the time had been issued by Kolomoyskiy to his business partners who might either have not paid them back or had done so on preferential conditions.
Gontareva said the bank?s debts grew to $5.6 billion by December 1.
Kolomoyskiy himself has yet to comment.
But one PrivatBank manager on Sunday called the government?s decision a consequence of ?media attacks? led by political powerbrokers who opposed Kolomoyskiy.

Vijaya Dahanayake: an honest politician
	
by Nihal de Alwis ??
Vijaya Dahanayake, eldest son of the revered teacher K. Dahanayake, was our classmate at Richmond College, who bid goodbye to us after being ill for a time. ?
Vijaya was one of the most determined students at the College, with several handicaps in that he was born with a defect in his eyesight. But he was one of those students at Richmond who excelled in debating and applied himself to ?his studies with commitment. He was an important member of the College debating team. I recall his late father, a much respected teacher and a brilliant product of Richmond College as Principal of Denham Academy where he nurtured and trained his three sons, namely Vijaya, Saranaguptha and Parakrama in their English and General Knowledge. In fact sometimes when we visited Vijaya we were also encouraged to participate in these sessions. Vijaya?s father, K. Dahanayake was very keen to impart his knowledge and experience to his three sons.?
I recall when it came to exams or writing notes in class, Vijaya used a magnifying glass to enable him to write notes and answer question papers. To me and our classmates, Vijaya was a man who was rich in qualities though not rich in monetary terms. A person who valued compassion, love and humanity. He always displayed a sense of honesty and integrity despite these qualities and spoke out expressing his views tempered with cordiality, tact and compassion. To my knowledge, he never said anything to hurt anyone. He was a very sincere friend who extended a helping hand to anyone.?
I also recall his closeness to his cousin Ranjith de Silva, better known as R.L. de Silva, who was a batch mate of mine in the Police, and always gave him brotherly advice about his heram scaram ways. Vijaya was helpful to me in a situations where I was used by a colleague of mine to get me transferred from Allawa police station without any rhyme or reason.
?He in fact intervened on my behalf and spoke to his uncle Late Mr. W. Dahnayake, one time Prime Minister who was the Minister of Home Affairs in 1969 and helped me to get the transfer cancelled. Vijaya learnt his ABC in politics from his uncle, Late W. Dahanayake when he was his Private Secretary.
?He had a good grounding and was successful, winning the Municipal Elections ultimately becoming the Mayor of Galle. It was around this time that he married Nalani whom I came to know when he used to come to the airport to proceed to BELGUIM Schipole on a KLM flight when I was the Security Manager. His wife has been a great asset to him. ?
Vijaya is an excellent example of a politician who lived honourably and had a vision. His vision in politics was to improve the city of Galle.?
It is well known by all that his visits to Europe whilst he was Mayor of Galle produced results in terms of development in the Galle Fort and Galle City. Perhaps he is the last of the Mohicans who lived a simple and humble life with a high degree of honesty which was clearly displayed through the way he lived all these years, in his parental home along with his brothers who supported him. A politician who lived sans jeeps, luxury vehicles and bodyguards. ?
Vijaya to me was a person who had clean hands, a pure heart and did not lift his soul for what is false. ?
He also believed that life should resemble channels and not reservoirs, for reservoirs store water and channels distribute it. That was Vijaya. He was a channel of blessings to others. ?We all love you Vijaya. We will never forget you ?
May you Rest in Peace. ?
Your classmates at Richmond.

We did not talk to China about regime change: JO
	
The joint opposition today denied rumours that it had held talks with China on a regime change in Sri Lanka, but reiterated that it was opposed to the sale of the country?s national resources.
JO member G.L. Peiris said they welcomed investments coming into the country but that however there was a difference between the sale of national assets and investments.
?Former president Mahinda Rajapsksa's government was consistent in its policy towards China, but the move to hand over 15,000 acres of land to China may lead to public discontent,? he said and added that the government should stick to the original proposal of allocating 750 acres for investments in the Hambantota district.
Meanwhile, JO member Bandula Gunawardane said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe should reveal to the country why he ordered the cancellation of a foreign deal relating to the Seylan Bank in the share market.
?Rs.1.1 billion shares or a 7.5 per cent stake in Seylan Bank, owned by the Bank of Ceylon was sold to a foreign institution. However, Mr. Wickremesinghe had directed that this deal be reversed,? he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
