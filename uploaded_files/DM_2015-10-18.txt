Govt. to use LTTE suspects as witnesses: Wimal
	
The government was planning to produce former LTTE members, who are to be released from prisons in the near future, as witnesses against the armed forces for the proceedings of the proposed Hybrid Court, Opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa charged today.
National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader Weerawansa said he was informed by reliable sources close to the government regarding the plan.
All arrangements are being done by the Maithri-Ranil coalition government to make our forces guilty as war criminals in the Hybrid War Crimes Court proceedings. Was this the change our people wanted and what they voted for Weerawansa asked.
He added that prisoners, who were found guilty for involving in LTTE terrorist activities, would be released in the next few months by the government in order to prepare them for Hybrid Court proceedings.
The hunger strike launched by suspected ex-LTTE detainees had been called off after an assurance given by the President.
Opposition Leader R. Sampathan last week said that Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapaksa had in principle agreed to the release of many prisoners and that President Sirisena had also agreed to the position of the Justice Minister.

He said therefore many Tamil youths held under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) could be released soon, while those implicated with serious offences would be held further to face charges and tried. (Piyumi Fonseka)

I defeated Mahinda Rajapaksa- SF

There is no Yahapalanaya as expected by the public. If the Government wants to go ahead with the path that the people expected, it (Government) should defeat the supporters who were with Mahinda Rajapaksa in the previous regime, Fonseka said while addressing a party meeting in Batticaloa.
He also said that his Democratic Party will contest the forth coming Provincial Council election alone.
I am the one, who defeated Mahinda Rajapaksa, but still some of his supporters are with the incumbent Government and they should be defeated as well. If I could defeat him, there is no big deal defeating his goon, he added. (Jauffer Khan)

Transport Minister wants reparation from PMB
	
Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said yesterday that he would seek restitution for the damage caused to the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA), due to paddy being stored within the airport premises, from the Paddy Marketing Board (PMB), soon.
Speaking after visiting the airport, he said the airport, including the hi-tech equipment stored in the warehouses of the MRIA, had been badly damaged by the dust arising from the paddy stored there.
The Transport Ministry's media spokesman, Viraj Abesinghe said that minister had said that the MRIA, which he had described as a national need, should not be used for other, politically motivated, purposes.
I could observe the kind of damage that had been caused to the airport premises by the paddy. The Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport was constructed as there was a national need for it. No one should consider it a white elephant. We will give a reasonable period of time for the Paddy Marketing Board to remove the paddy from the airport warehouses, he said.
He added that he would inform Cabinet of this through a Cabinet paper.
He added that a special promotion programme would be launched to attract more airlines to the MRIA. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Transporting coal by rail from Nov 1
	
The Transport Ministry has decided to transport coal by train from Trincomalee to Mahawa from November 1, as it would be more profitable for both parties as well as reduce the environmental hazards, Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.
He said steps would also be taken to transport Cement as well as Flour from Prima company in the east in the near future.
Transportation of coal and other goods by train is more profitable and owing to this, the road congestion, air pollution and road accidents are reduced, therefore action will be taken to use the Railways with effect from November 01 and come to an agreement with Holcim Company for the transport of Cement, Minister Silva said.
He further said, 45 trucks of coal will be transported everyday from Tricomalee to Puttalam and also to Mahawa by rail, resulting in the reduction of the heavy congestion. Transportation of coal to Mahawa is more profitable to the Railway Department, he said. At present 12 railway trucks are used to transport coal. The Minister said that he has advised to use another train for this purpose.
Earlier a railway jetty was constructed to transport coal to China Bay and used it. However, it was halted later and therefore Coal, Prima flour and Cement were transported using the highway. The Transport Minister has instructed the authorities to resume the transportation of goods through railway transport up to China Bay.
The Minister made these instructions at a meeting held on October 16 at the China Bay Railway Station and after observing the unloading of coal imported by Holcim Company which arrived from a ship from Malaysia.
According to the agreement signed by the Holcim Company and the Railway Department, the railways earns Rs.202 million per year. Meanwhile, the higher officials of the Holcim Company told the Minister that in due course transportation of cement from Puttalam and Trincomalee would be handed over to the Railway Department.
