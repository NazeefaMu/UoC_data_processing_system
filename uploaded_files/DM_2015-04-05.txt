Even standard practices are portrayed as abuse -MR
	
Office of the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa today rejected the allegation level against the Rajapaksa government on the road constructions and said that even standard practices in the construction industry are portrayed as instances of abuse by the previous government.
At a press conference last Thursday (2), Minister Kabir Hashim made certain allegations about several infrastructure projects initiated by President Mahinda Rajapaksas government.
While the government is engaged in this exercise of vilifying their predecessors with dubious accusations, the development work that was started by the previous government has grounded to a halt. Thousands of people are losing their jobs and are not in a position even to celebrate the New Year. We believe the present government should look to the future, instead of wasting time concocting various stories about the past, the former Presidents office said.
It also said that infrastructure projects are costly and complicated and it is always possible to make various allegations that may seem plausible to the general public who have no awareness of the complexities involved.
All costs associated with large projects are scrutinised by technical evaluation committees and cabinet appointed tender boards and everything has to finally get cabinet approval. Our fear is that given the absurd lengths to which the present government is taking this campaign of misinformation, a prejudice against all development projects may be created in the minds of the public - which will finally be to the detriment of future generations in this country, it said.
Giving details answers for Minister Hashims allegation, the statement also stated that Minister Hashim characterised those instances as evidence of large scale corruption.
Though minister Hashim says that the average cost of a two lane highway in the year 2010 was Rs. 75 million per km, road projects are not generic products like sugar or dhal which can have an average world market price. Every road project is unique and the cost will differ due to various factors. Building a highway elevated on columns across marshy land will increase costs. The levelling of hills, blasting through rock, filling in of marshy or low lying land, the building of bridges and culverts, the width of the road and the number of lanes, the cost of acquiring land etcetera increases or decreases the cost by large amounts, it added.

Labour Tribunal orders Canadian HC to reinstate employee
	
A Sri Lankan who had served at the Canadian High Commission (CHC) in Colombo for more than eight years as a driver had been terminated from service unlawfully based on his ethnicity.
Delivering a judgment in connection with a complaint made by a Sri Lankan who had served at the Canadian High Commission (CHC) in Colombo for more than eight years as a driver that he had been terminated from service unlawfully based on his ethnicity, the Labour Tribunal had ordered the CHC to reinstate the victim to his former driver position or pay a compensation of six million rupees.

The Labour Tribunal in Colombo made this order following an ex-parte hearing into a complaint made by Lal Fernando of Udugampola, Minuwangoda.

The Labour Tribunal observed that the respondent CHC had not terminated the victim from service in a lawful or fair manner and further observed that the respondent had also failed to ensure its representation before a tribunal hearing into alleged violation of employees rights.
The petitioner Lal Fernando complained he had brought many unhealthy malpractices to the notice of the CHC management in good faith and said that as a result of his long struggle, the CHC had reduced the number of working hours per week from 48 to 40 effective from May 1, 2013. He further alleged he was denied opportunities for fair earning due to his inability to speak Tamil fluently. Mr. Fernando said the CHC had ensured that he was kept out of their regular visits to the North and the East, where they met opposing political and other influential persons as they did not wish to expose their interference in Sri Lankan politics.

Opposition urges Speaker to postpone 19A debate
	
The opposition representatives will urge Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa to postpone the debate on the 19th Amendment to the Constitution on the principle that the entire process being adopted for its enactment is constitutionally flawed, a parliamentarian said today.
The Bill has been listed for debate on April 8, 9 and 10. However, former External Affairs Minister Prof. G.L. Peiris said people should be given a week to petition the Supreme Court against such a regular Bill in terms of Article 121(1) of the Constitution. 
Asserting that the Constitutional Bill presented in Parliament on March 24 is not the current version as numerous amendments have been proposed during hearing in the Supreme Court, he said the public should have the chance to see the latest one.
He noted the latest Bill, after being presented in Parliament, should remain on the Order Paper for one week for people to petition the Supreme Court if they wished. 
Article 12(1), which deals with the ordinary exercise of constitutional jurisdiction in respect of Bills, says, The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to ordinarily determine any such question as aforesaid may be invoked by the President by a written reference addressed to the Chief Justice, or by any citizen by a petition in writing addressed to the Supreme Court. Such reference shall be made, or such petition shall be filed, within one week of the Bill being placed on the Order Paper of Parliament.
Asked about the next action by the Opposition, Prof. Peiris said he, along with several other Opposition representatives would meet the Speaker and urge him not to entertain the Bill for debate this week. (KB)
