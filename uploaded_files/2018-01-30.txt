?Adarei Mang?  Young love in Mount Lavinia
	
When Prageeth Rathnayake (as Pawan, the protagonist of his debut film, Adarei Mang) enters his unfinished, drab, concrete-laden house with a bunch of flowers and a sense of exhilaration (he?s passed his university final year exams with a First Class), and looks into each and every room calling out his sweetheart?s name, it?s almost out of the scene in Brian De Palma?s Body Double where Craig Wasson does the same thing in a more expansive home.?
Except that in De Palma?s film the hero finds his girlfriend in bed with another man, while in Prageeth?s film the hero finds his wife unconscious (we later learn she has a brain tumour): the one punctures the protagonist?s idealism so much that he turns away, the other punctures it so much that he becomes a brawny macho, carrying the comatose wife to the hospital. (In fact the editing, which had been so happy-go-lucky and optimistic until that point, detoured rather wildly to what was, for me, a parody of the hero-saves-his-woman trope that our mainstream movies indulge in again and again.)? ?
Adareyi Mang plays around, subtly and (I suspect) despite the director?s own intentions, with this kind of inbuilt self-parody. You feel something coming up, something that will culminate with the exhilaration of release, but it never does quite materialise; all you have are bits and pieces of the conventional cinema being tossed out to the audience, edited quickly and rapidly in one scene, then slowly in another, then cutting into a series of close-ups that end with the lovers, shocked at the callousness of their elders, either defying them openly (the husband) or dropping the tray of sweetmeats she?s holding on the floor, shocked (the wife). It?s dazzling, though strangely limited to one town (the entire story unfolds along Galle Road and in Mount Lavinia, except for the song-and-dance sequences, where you simply don?t care where the lovers are), and its editing, though rather reminiscent of kitschy music videos and testosterone-laden melodramas at several points, is redeemed by the acting and Prageeth?s carefully laid out narrative.? ?

Adareyi Mang plays around, subtly and (I suspect) despite the director?s own intentions, with this kind of inbuilt self-parody.
Movies tend to arouse certain special, private, hidden feelings, which I believe is the most essential function of any art form, anywhere. There?s no attempt at rationalising what you feel; what you feel is what you feel. That?s why I go to the Savoy, the Regal, and the Majestic, and closer to my hometown, the Tower in Moratuwa, intending not just to assess my relationship with the world and the people I have to put up with, but also to fulfill my expectation that once the show starts and the story unravels something will happen to me. I don?t want to spend too much time trying to make sense of what that something is. I believe, therefore, that I am a representative of the demographic that chooses to be enthralled by an otherwise conventional product like Dharmayuddaya and Adaraneeya Kathawak rather than be confused by the intricate workings of an art house picture. That is why I am thankful that Prageeth has chosen for his debut a love story that never quite gives up its devices to the conventional love story narrative, and yet doesn?t abandon that narrative either. This peculiar dualism ? I long to see it being worked on in other mainstream Sinhala movies ? is what I liked most about Adarei Mang.? ?
Certainly refreshing? ?
It?s so simple minded (which isn?t necessarily a bad thing, by the way) that the characters can almost be identified as the types they faintly are; the idealistic lovers, the forever-forgiving-employer (when Pawan has an altercation with Malmi, his wife-to-be, played by Chathurika Peiris, and she leaves the nursery she is teaching, the Principal doesn?t rebuke her, she tells her that only she has the prerogative to fire her), the forever-by-your-side-and-then-by-his-sidekick to the woman (who regularly alternates between her friendship with Malmi and her devotion to the romance between Malmi and Pawan, to the consternation of both), the inflexible capitalist-executive father (who, as with every mainstream commercial love story from here, happens to be the father to the boy), and the leftist-idealist in-law (Malmi?s father). When Pawan?s father, played by Robin Fernando, asks after his prospective daughter-in-law?s father, played by Neil Alles, and his associations with the July 1980 strike, you sense the undercurrents of contempt and snobbery, but that?s it; the friendliness deteriorates, the two elders part ways in a fit of fury and anger, and as for the love story, well, it?s left to be strewn together from scratch by the two lovers. It?s certainly refreshing, but then again isn?t it more of the same? It?s roughly the same thing with the sequence in which Pawan?s feelings of tenderness, aroused after his first real encounter with Malmi, are conveyed to us by his University friends singing ?Sonduru Lovata Mal Vahala?; the same device, reworked, revisited.? ?
So why is it that I was able to wade through those reworked, revisited devices without bothering to be tired by them? Again, that dualism I mentioned before. It?s the sort of dualism which elongates a scene or sequence and then suddenly punctures it: the discovery by the jovial husband of the comatose wife; the shattering of their idealisations of their elders by Robin Fernando?s abruptly delivered hints at Malmi?s infidelity (how many other men, he asks rather cruelly, has she been seeing before Pawan, and how many more men will she be seeing even after marrying Pawan?); the sudden outbursts of self-righteousness from Pawan after he finds out that Malmi borrowed some money from her mother (he sees this as a compromise, the sort that he is not at all willing to reach with his now emotionally distant father), followed by a reconciliation under a rainstorm (we expect them to reconcile the same way the lovers from Chandran Rutnam?s Me Wage Adarayak reconciled after the frail wife tried to get her father-in-law to talk to her husband and gave up after the husband lashed at her, but no: she merely tells him that she forgot the spare key to their house, evincing not tears but laughs from the audience).? ?
?
With five musical numbers, and no fights, Adarei Mang is a peculiar product; the boy is rich and the girl poor, but neither the boy nor the girl has to put up with the indifference of the elders
Unconventional? ?
The plot opens up almost like clockwork (he meets his girl because his car breaks down and he has to take the bus; he meets her again because he has to drop his niece at the nursery where she works at) but that doesn?t mean that everything follows the same conventional narrative that love stories usually follow. The hero doesn?t have to beat anyone: he has to be beaten up by everyone (i.e. the bus passengers who think he?s molesting Malmi).?
He doesn?t have to sing to her to win her; he just gives her a homily about love (it?s a reworking of the ?love means never having to say sorry? one-liner, though I won?t reveal what Prageeth, who is his film?s scriptwriter, philosophises by way of explaining what true love is to Malmi). He doesn?t have to find the money to save the dying wife; the father, in a change of mind (perhaps he was testing his son?s fidelity to his newlywed by refusing to finance her operation), goes back on his earlier decision and gives the son the money to save her. The result? Everyone?s saved, everyone?s happy.? ? But then, owing to the freewheeling-ness of the second half, I felt that the first half of Adarei Mang was rather mechanised, as though the director was afraid of loosening up a little, as though slackening up was, in his opinion, antithetical to the meticulousness of his editing. Even the acting reflected this shift from the first to the second part of the story, especially Prageeth?s acting: rather too cautious in the first few sequences, only later being liberated from the straitjacket that overly careful acting can compel. Perhaps that?s to do with the fact that Prageeth, who I used to see as a child in the occasional teledrama, abandoned the movies for the stage and hence, upon his return to the cinema, couldn?t evade the careful planning, the in-your-face expressiveness, the rigid playing, that the theatre inspires. This could be seen in even the songs: the first two or three (the music is by Victor Ratnayake, who performs duets with Uresha Ravihari) pieces felt forced and contrived, while the very last (?Neela Guwan Thale?) felt rather less so.? ?
With five musical numbers, and no fights, Adarei Mang is a peculiar product; the boy is rich and the girl poor, but neither the boy nor the girl has to put up with the indifference of the elders, since their elopement is so quickly edited that we don?t bother with those elders either. Perhaps Prageeth felt that slow editing and putting up with expository dialogues and sequences and dances and fights would have punctured the economy of the whole plot. Perhaps I?m being a bit too harsh here when I say that Prageeth may not be in the right completely there. And perhaps I?m being a bit fair by him, and his debut, when I say that the tagline for the film (?For those who have truly loved and for those who have not?) aptly sums up the demographic it?s aimed at. Which happens to be you and me.? ?
?
NOTE: The opening titles of Adarei Mang inform us that this is Prageeth?s tribute to the man who taught him ?acting, directing, and life?, Salamon Fonseka. Who? A great man, a great teacher, underused in his own country. I intend on writing about him, soon.

Bruno Mars and  ?Time?s Up? win big at 2018 Grammys
	
?
DPA, 29th JANUARY, 2018-Bruno Mars claimed the night?s biggest accolades at the 60th Grammy Awards in New York on Sunday, taking home trophies for Best Album, Record and Song Of The Year.
The event also gave visible support to the ?Time?s Up? movement, with many performers and guests clad in white to speak out against sexual harassment and abuse which has been shown to be rife in the entertainment industry.
?You guys are the reason I?m in the studio pulling my hair out,? Mars told his fellow Best Album nominees which included Jay-Z, Lorde and Childish Gambino.
The R&B singer won all six of the top awards he was nominated for including prizes for album, record for ?24K Magic? and song of the year for ?That?s What I Like.?
Kendrick Lamar also won five Grammys, including Best Rap Album for ?DAMN.?
?It is really about expressing yourself and putting that paint on the canvas for the world to evolve, for the next listener, the next generation after,? Lamar said during his acceptance speech for Best Rap Album. The Compton-born rapper also took home the trophy for Best Rap/Sung Performance for ?Loyalty? featuring Rihanna.

Clinton trolls Trump in Grammys surprise
	
?
Bruno Mars beat Jay-Z for the top Grammy Awards on Sunday, but the surprise star of the night was former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton reading from Michael Wolff?s controversial book ?Fire and Fury.?
A pre-taped parody sketch saw Grammy Awards host James Corden audition celebrities, including John Legend, Cher, Cardi B and Snoop Dogg. They read excerpts from the deeply critical book about President Donald Trump?s first year in office, ostensibly as contenders for a spoken word Grammy prize.
Clinton, who lost the 2016 election to Trump, read an excerpt from the book about Trump?s eating habits. ?One reason why he liked to eat at McDonald?s: Nobody knew he was coming and the food was safely pre-made,? Clinton read.
Corden then praised her, saying ?The Grammy is in the bag.?
The president?s family and members of his administration immediately criticized the segment.
His son Donald Trump Jr. tweeted: ?Getting to read a #fakenews book excerpt at the Grammys seems like a great consolation prize for losing the presidency.?
In a follow-up tweet, he added: ?The more Hillary goes on television the more the American people realize how awesome it is to have @realDonaldTrump in office.?
Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who is known to post on social media about her love of pop music, tweeted that Clinton?s appearance ?ruined the Grammys. Such a shame.?
Wolff?s book ?Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House? became an instant bestseller on Jan. 5 when its release was pulled forward after published excerpts set off a political firestorm, threats by Trump lawyers of legal action and an effort to halt publication.

Futile to continue ban on LTTE: NPC Chairman
	
Northern Provincial Council (NPC) Chairman C.V.K. Sivagnanam told a news conference, that it was meaningless to continue with the ban imposed on LTTE within Sri Lanka.
"Eight years has lapsed since the war ended with even former LTTE members joining mainstream politics after surrendering their weapons and in such a scenario continuing with the ban on the LTTE is meaningless," he said.
The chairman said the LTTE wanted to win the rights of the Tamil people and the Tamil political leaders are also engaged in politics with the same intention.
He said the time had come to consider the release of all LTTE suspects in custody and allow them to integrate into society after taking the necessary legal precautions and withdrawing the ban on the LTTE. (Romesh Madushanka)

GMOA now lauds Health Minister
	
In a new twist the GMOA which had been previously highly critical of Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne, today lauded him saying the minister had committed himself towards granting their demands.
It said the Health Secretary Janaka Sugathadasa was told by the minister to approve all their demands.
The health authorities had agreed to grant nine of their demands including the release of annual duty free permits to the medical officers without any restriction.
GMOA Secretary Aluthge said the minister had permitted the revision of recent amendments to promotions and curtailed allowances to medical officers made by the Ministry. The curtailed mobile phone allowance of Rs.4,000 was also reinstated.
He said the demands would be sent to the National Salaries and Cadre Commission immediately with the minister directing that they be implemented as soon as possible.
Dr. Aluthge said that the minister had also accepted the GMOA?s stance on SAITM.
Meanwhile GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Naveen de Soysa said the union had not made a deal with the minister in the process of achieving their demands and that GMOA President Anuruddha Padeniya did not have any intention to enter politics.
He said the GMOA always tried to avoid taking strike action to achieve their demands and would do so in the future if the minister continues to have a positive attitude towards the association.
Dr. Soysa warned that government servants should avoid clashing with a powerful association like the GMOA and the Health Secretary who earlier held a position in the Tourism Ministry should never attempt to play with patients' lives. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

India has 21 million ?unwanted? girls
	
?
NEW DELHI AFP Jan29, 2018 -The desire of Indian parents for sons has created an estimated 21 million ?unwanted? girls because couples keep having children until they produce a boy, the government said Monday.? ?
Indian parents have historically wanted sons, who are seen as breadwinners and family heirs. Girls are often viewed as a financial burden in a country where the tradition of giving a marriage dowry persists.? ?Even though sex selection is against the law, illegal gender-based abortions have been blamed for a sex ratio of 940 females for every 1,000 males in the last census.? ?
But many couples continued having children until they produced their desired number of sons, the government said in its annual economic survey report.? ??Families where a son is born are more likely to stop having children than families where a girl is born. This is suggestive of parents employing ?stopping rules? -- having children till a son is born and stopping thereafter,? it said.? ?
Couples, particularly women, in India face immense pressure to produce male children and many rural families do not send girls to school, marrying them off young. But the report said India?s preference for sons appeared ?inoculated to development?, with even wealthier families not immune.? ?Illegal sex selection and gender-based abortions remain rampant across social and economic groups in the country, according to several studies.? ?
A 2011 study in the British medical journal The Lancet found that up to 12 million girls had been aborted in the last three decades in India.? ? ?

Israel objects to Holocaust law absolving Poland of responsibility for Nazi crimes
	
?
HINDUSTAN TIMES, 29th JANUARY, 2018-Israel?s prime minister and Holocaust survivors on Sunday bridled at a draft Polish law that would make it illegal to suggest Poland bore any responsibility for Nazi atrocities committed on its soil.
The Israeli foreign ministry summoned Poland?s charge d?affaires - the ambassador was abroad ? to object to the bill, which is still going through parliament. ?We will under no circumstances accept any attempt to rewrite history,? Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in lengthy public remarks to his cabinet.
Netanyahu and Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki talked by phone late on Sunday, the Israeli leader?s office said, and they ?had agreed to open immediate dialogue between teams from both countries to try to reach understandings on the legislation.?
Before World War Two, Poland was home to Europe?s largest Jewish community of some 3.2 million. Nazi Germany attacked and occupied Poland in 1939 and later built death camps including Auschwitz and Treblinka on Polish soil. Most of the Jews that lived in Poland were killed by the Nazi occupiers. The Polish government said in a statement the legislation aimed to stop the Polish people or state being blamed for Nazi crimes.
The bill, passed by the lower house of parliament on Friday, would make the use of phrases such as ?Polish death camps? punishable by up to three years in prison.
To become law, the bill, which could yet be amended, must be approved by the Senate and Polish President Andrzej Duda.
?We will accept no limitation on truthful historical research,? Netanyahu earlier told his cabinet.

## Title: Lines of defense in risk management

Lines of defense in risk management
	
Risk management in banks can be simple if every in house managerial pillar of the organizational structure does its job effectively and is sensitive to risk.?
It is the collective responsibility of every managerial function to ring fence the bank against impending risks taking into consideration its cost implications. But in the structure of functional responsibility, line management is passionate for accelerating business growth as a primary function. In pursuing its objective, the bank branches have to assume business risk.?
Thus a conscious and sensitive approach towards risk management is essential at the grass root level. Once the risk is taken, it is difficult to shed. It can be measured and mitigated so that the intensity of impact of risk is brought down.?
Hence risk management is surmounted with two distinct challenges. (i) Management of risk which is already perpetuating in the bank?s business mix (ii) Learning from the past, how to devise business strategies to proactively desist from allowing new risk to enter the bank?s domain without losing opportunities of business growth.?
It is a complex syndrome. Banks should be able to do business harnessing full market potentiality and endeavor to stay beyond peers by balancing risk and earnings so as to optimize economic value for stake holders. This calls for a fine collaborative risk management strategies at all levels of the bank.?
?
A conscious and sensitive approach towards risk management is essential at the grassroots level
Defense framework?
In this league, banks have a well-defined system that allows them to continue to make business decisions that has potentiality to impact risk related to their changing business complexities.?
Organization of risk management span across institutionalized policies, products, process, support infrastructure, delegation of authority and a well-defined risk appetite. But to be pragmatic, a common and widely accepted method for mitigating risk is the evolution of three lines of defense framework.It emerged as fire wall for protecting against risks, particularly after the 1990s (1995 to 2001) when the dot.com bust exposed the sheer breadth and depth of the risk landscape.?
This framework was designed to help organizations (including banks) to clearly identify the roles and responsibilities of the business units; practice ongoing risk management; and sustain risk management activities.
When applied properly, the three lines of defense can create effective dialogue and analysis that prevents banks from overlooking risk factors that could ultimately cause financial disaster; as well as allow them to be proactive in how they manage risk within the bank. It is interesting that Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) refined it in its Integrated Risk Management Direction (2011) directing banks to follow a? risk management philosophy in the day to day business activities of the bank by managing its risk exposures effectively and contributing to the strategic decision-making process. Banks should remain committed to maximizing shareholder value by growing its business in line with a board determined risk appetite, the bank? should be mindful of achieving this objective in the best interest of all stakeholders.?
Distinct lines of defense?
In the architecture of Risk management, there are three identified distinct lines of defense to insulate banks against various types of risks that perpetuates systems. It is known as three lines of defense. (i) Business Line Responsibility ? Business owners, the line management? (ii) Corporate Risk Management ? Standard setters/policy makers which is usually the board of the bank? (iii) Independent assurance provider group/compliance assurance group/Internal and external audit groups.?
Each layer of defense has its own distinct role which provides shield to mitigate the onslaught of risk. The role of each defense system is important to bring out clarity in risk governance.?
Role of defense layers?
nFirst defense rests on the line management ? operating people who mobilize business and execute operations. Branches and their controlling offices form the first layer of defense who need to keep a track of quality of business and its risk sensitivity. Being responsible for operational management, line management has ownership, responsibility and accountability for assessing, controlling and mitigating risk in business mix exposures together with maintaining effective internal controls.
If they ignore the basics while selecting a unit of business the risk management group, the second defense and compliance and internal audits ? the third defense would have to work really hard to see that the risks do not cause loss to the bank. Hence, point of undertaking business is important as a first filter of risk. Systemic controls such as foolproof standard operating procedure follow up of internal controls and keeping risk governance in view are important.?
nThe second line of defense ? the risk governance team is to provide an umbrella ecosystem for better management of risk in the bank that defines risk appetite and sets the policy framework as an enabler. It has to work on twin planks. The first basis is on the data emanating from the nuances of business composition in banks. The second basis is the market intelligence data and new dispensation of guidance from Central Bank that forms the basis of risk architecture.?
nThe second line of defense facilitates and monitors the implementation of effective risk management practices by operational management.The time sensitivity with which the policy framework is modulated determines the quality and effectiveness of second defense.
nThe Third defense comprises the compliance verification or supervisory team which provides feedback to second line of defense about what actually happens at the first defense, the line management.?
Their constant interactions bridging the gulf between first and second lien of defense is filled by it. It communicates from field level quality of compliance to risk governance teams so as to bring a correct semblance between the two critical defense functions.?
The internal audit function, the third line of defense is expected to provide assurance to the organization?srisk governance group on how effectively the organization assesses and manages its risks. They particularly look into the manner in which the first and second lines of defense operate. The assurance task covers all elements of an organization?s risk management framework, i.e. risk identification, risk assessment and response to communication of risk related information.
?
Risk management is surmounted with two distinct challenges
Integrated function of defense?
Looking to the framework of the three lines of defense, the risk managers have to take an integrated and holistic view of reinforcing support of each defense system. When integrated into a reckoning force with the help of technology, it can effectively strengthen the risk management.?
The three pillars of defense system of risk management is high intensity coordinated function that should remain engaged with each other so that gaps in fire walls are insulated well in time.?
The line management, the risk governance team and compliance architecture of the bank has to bind together into a risk microscope that can foresee the emerging risks, perceive and interpret its implications on the business architecture of the bank to be able to manage it effectively.?

?Nobody can find fault with how UNP  ran economy? - Malik Samarawickrama
	
?
Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade Malik Samarawickrama, in an interview with Daily mirror? responds to the allegations about the scam and speaks about the importance of Free Trade Agreements to export growth and international trade. The excerpts of the interview:? ?
QYou signed the Free Trade Agreement with Singapore. What is the next step?
As we promised, we will have countervailing duties and the trade related laws passed in Parliament when we meet in February. We have already debated the issue. It is now a matter of passing. The vote will be held when we meet in February. As far as the agreement is concerned, it is now up to the private sector to make use of this agreement. On the one hand, it is to improve trade. On the other hand, what we expect is the arrival of Singaporean investors to Sri Lanka.?
?QThere are allegations that the proper procedure was not followed in working out this FTA. In fact, some professional groups made this allegation. What is your view?
It is not true. We have been discussing this for over one and half years. We have consulted all the chambers and the professional associations.? ?
In one of the professional associations, we found some adverse comments made. It is only a couple of individuals, not the association. It is not going to affect them.?
?QWhat are your plans to reduce the balance of trade between the two countries?
The FTA is not only for reducing the balance of trade. This is a very comprehensive FTA. You cannot reduce the balance of trade. It depends on what we import. We import from them petroleum products, lubricants and so on. These are high-value items. These are not covered by the FTA. Over 90 odd percent of imports from Singapore will not come within the FTA. It is the same with India. Most of the items, coming from India, fall outside the FTA. Those are things required for the country, be they petroleum products or motor vehicles.? ?
QWhat are the tariff concessions we have received from Singapore?
Singapore is one of the most liberalized countries in the world. Their tariff is extremely low in any case. What we are looking at is how we can enter the markets in ASEAN. This is a high-quality agreement we have signed with one of the most liberalized economies in the world. We sent a clear message to the rest of the world that we are open for business.? ?
QHow far have you progressed with regard to the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) with India??
We have had seven or eight rounds of negotiations. At the next round, we are trying to see whether we can finalize this by July or August, this year.? ?
?
In the FTA with Singapore, we have allowed corporate sector transfers. It is advantageous to us. For India, it should be investment-based. There will be certain standards they will have to make. People will be allowed to come only in areas where we do not have sufficient expertise. Only qualified people will be allowed to come
QHow are you going to open the service sector in this instance??
We are not opening the service sector at all. Yet, in the FTA with Singapore, we have allowed corporate sector transfers. It is advantageous to us. For India, it should be investment-based. There will be certain standards they will have to make. People will be allowed to come only in areas where we do not have sufficient expertise. Only qualified people will be allowed to come.? ?
As for the FTA with China, we are waiting for some clarifications from them. Talks have been stalled for some time. Hopefully, we will recommence talks in March, this year.? ?
In the long run, we have to be competitive. We have a small domestic market of 20 million people. We are looking at the world market. The only way we can be competitive is by restructuring our industries, bringing in new technological know-how. The whole world is changing. If you do not change, you will be left behind. You can see how countries like Vietnam and Thailand have progressed so fast. We have to get out of the island mentality.??
QWhen you say island mentality, what does it mean?
We are only looking inwards. It makes us inefficient and uncompetitive. Last year, we had the highest export turnout of US $ 15.15 billion. We also had the highest ever Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) of US $ 1.63 billion. This shows that our economic policies are correct. We are on the right track. We expect our exports to go up by another 15 percent, and the FDI to be over US $ .2.5 billon. We can keep this momentum. After three to four years, we will be able to overcome our problems.? ?
QWhen attracting FDI, how can you compete with countries like Malaysia, Bangladesh and others in the region?
Along with FDI, there comes technological know-how. It is not only funds. They have to make sure that they make industries more competitive.? ?
We have to think of upskilling as well. They will ensure that our skills are developed.??
QThere is a shortage in our labour market. How are you going to address it?
There is a shortage in certain industries. We have to look at whether to bring in certain labourers as well. The construction industry is one where there is a shortage.
There is a shortage in the apparel industry.? ?
?
Last year, we had the highest export turnout of US $ 15.15 billion. We also had the highest ever Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) of US $ 1.63 billion. This shows that our economic policies are correct. We are on the right track.?
QThe President said recently that the economy was run by the UNP for the last three years. He said he would take it over. What do you feel about it?
?What people talk on election platforms should not be taken seriously.? ?
QThis comes from the Head of State. How can you be-little it?
But, it comes from a political platform. I do not think anybody can find fault with how the UNP ran the economy. We can already see that investment has gone up. Exports have gone up. This is only the beginning.? ?
Development work is going on. It may not be visible. We do not talk about it. There are a lot of activities going on. The freeway is being constructed from Kandy to Colombo. We just issued Request for proposals (RFP) for the Ratnapura expressway. A lot of rural roads are being constructed. A lot of water projects are being done. Power plants are being set up.? ?
On the other hand, we have given relief to people. Drug prices have come down substantially. Whatever anyone might say, the cost of living, compared with 2014, has come down. Gas prices have come down. Consumer items have come down in prices. In spite of severe droughts for three to four seasons, we have ensured there is sufficient food for the people. Even rice is now available at a reasonable price.? ?
QYou mean to say that the allegation about mismanagement of the economy does not hold water?
I do not think so. We have to make some difficult decisions in the interests of our future generations. It could not have been business as usual. If we had gone the same way, we would have been bankrupt by now. We had to take hard decisions. Results are beginning to show. By 2020, our country will be a different place.? ?
QWhat about the plan for the development of the Mattala International Airport?
RFPs were called. No proper proposal had been received. Now, discussions are underway with the Indian Aviation Authority to set up a joint venture. It will be between the Civil Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka and the Indian Aviation Authority.?
?
This is a high-quality agreement we have signed with one of the most liberalized economies in the world. We sent a clear message to the rest of the world that we are open for business.? ?
?
This is a high-quality agreement we have signed with one of the most liberalized economies in the world. We sent a clear message to the rest of the world that we are open for business.? ?
?
?QIs that to develop it as an international airport?
Yes, it is for the development of it as an international airport. Viability is being studied. If the Indians are coming, they will ensure that it is viable. There is a lot of traffic from India.? ?
QHow far have you progressed?
Officials are continuing the discussions. We should be able to complete it within the next three to four months.? ?
QThe UNP MPs talk about the formation of a UNP government in the future. What is your view?
We have not discussed anything of this as yet. I think if you are to develop this country, both the parties have to work together not only until 2020 but even after that. As UNPers, we are only interested in developing our country and making it a better place for our people. Others, for political reasons, may be saying various things.? ?
QNow, the two parties take on each other in a bitter way. How feasible is it to sustain the unity government?
The UNP has not criticized the President. One or two individuals may have criticized. The UNP, as a party, has maintained our discipline. The Prime Minister has not responded. The senior ministers have not responded. One or two people may have said various things.? ?
QBut, the President took that criticism so seriously. He even staged a walkout from the Cabinet. We heard you approached the President and tried to pacify him. What is your view?
I do not like to discuss what happened in the Cabinet.? ?
?
We have given relief to people. Drug prices have come down substantially. Whatever anyone might say, the cost of living, compared with 2014, has come down. Gas prices have come down. Consumer items have come down in prices.?
QAgain, is it possible for the two parties to be together under these circumstances?
Well, from our point of view, we have no issue. If we are to develop this country, we have to be together. We have to accommodate other parties. If we are to have development, we cannot have divisive politics.? ?
QThe UNP promised to establish a rule-based environment. But, the Central Bank bond scam took place under the UNP ?led government. How has it affected your image?
The Commission?s report very clearly says that the UNP, as a party, is not involved. No one from the UNP is involved. We are for a rule-based structure. We are making a lot of changes as a result. We are making a lot of reforms in all fronts-on the monetary policy, fiscal policy, trade policy etc. All these will be done taking into account the best practices of the world.? ?
QThe UNP is accused of attempts to cover up the scam. What is your response?
The UNP has never covered up anything. We have said that action should be taken against whoever is responsible. We are also making our own inquiry. The commission has requested the Attorney General to investigate. If there is anyone to be prosecuted after the Attorney General?s investigation, the party will certainly take action.?
?QBe it even an MP of the party??
It can be an MP, Minister or anyone.? ?
QActually, one Minister of your party was stripped of his portfolio over the bond scam. What is your view?
You are talking about Ravi Karunanayake. In case of Ravi, he resigned. That is nothing to do with the bond issue. That is because of a private transaction he has had.??
QLater, Mr. Karunanayake said there was backstabbing within. What is your view?
I do not think there is anything like that. The UNP is a very disciplined political party. We do not criticize for the sake of criticizing. At the same time, if any person is found guilty, action will be taken.? ?
QYou said the two parties should stay together. Does it mean you will have a round of talks with the SLFP after the election for it?
Yes exactly. The policies of the two parties have been quite different. For years, we have been fighting each other. Some people are still having the same thinking. Thinking must change.? ?
QYou were involved in politics for a long time. Yet, you entered Parliament for the first time this year. How do you feel?
It is not easy to get things done in politics. I am coming from the corporate sector. First, we have to change the mindset of the people. It is? time to change the mindset of politicians. Most of the politicians are only looking at the next election. As far as the technocrats in Parliament are concerned, we are interested in doing something for the country.? ?
QThere is an allegation that the UNP made a lot of money out of the bond scam. Former MP Rajiva Wijesinha even implicated your name. What have you got to say?
All these are baseless allegations. I do not think anyone should listen to Rajiva Wijesinha. The bond commission itself said nothing of that sort happened. Then, why should anyone take Rajiva Wijesinha so seriously?? ? ?

President Sirisena protects bond scam offenders - JO
	
President Maithripala Sirisena has been attempting to protect the major bond scam offenders since the beginning of the first bond scam on February 2015, Joint Opposition MP Prasanna Ranatunga said today.
Addressing a news conference, he said the bond scam should have been nipped in the bud if President Sirisena had not dissolved the parliament when the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) report in connection with the Central Bank bond issue was presented to parliament by its chairman D.E.W. Gunasekera, after the first bond fraud on February 2015.
?President was well aware that the COPE report had envisaged the responsibility of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in relation with the bond scam. Having known that Premier was one of the major culprits of bonds fraud, President Sirisena dissolved parliament without debating the COPE report in order to protect the Premier,? MP Ranatunga said.
He further said that President Sirisena appointed Arjuna Mahendran as the Governor of the Central Bank knowing that he was not Sri Lankan citizen. Thus, he asked whether we need any evidence other than this to say that President Sirisena protects rouges.?(Sheain Fernandopulle) ? ? ?

President violated election law: SLPP
	
The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) today accused President Maithripala Sirisena of having violated election laws by saying funds won?t be allocated to the Local Government (LG) bodies that are won by the SLPP.
It said Minister Lakshman Kiriella had also said the funds would be distributed through Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to the LG bodies.
?This is a threat made to discourage SLPP voters and to collect votes for the SLFP and UNP.?Council funds belong to people and they should be distributed among LG bodies irrespective of the political party which governs it. Funds are not handouts or the private property of either the President or the Premier,? SLPP Chairman?G.L. Peiris told a news briefing.
He pointed out that threatening to cut off funds to a LG body was a violation of election law as well as depriving the fundamental rights of the people.
Apart from issuing threats, he said the government continues to mislead the masses.
?The government says action will be taken against those who are responsible for the bond scam. However, Arjuna Mahendran is still in Singapore. No action will be taken against him as it was he who helped and facilitated the ?Singapore meetings? which helped this government to come to power,? he said.
Meanwhile, MP Bandula Gunawardana said the joint opposition had been critical about the inefficiency and fiscal mismanagement of the United National Party for years although the President had only taken notice of it just as an election was pending. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Although the GMOA appeared to have settled their differences with the Health Minister on the SAITM issue, the Inter University Students' Federation (IUSF) said today it would continue the SAITM struggle regardless of the GMOA backing out.
IUSF Convener Lahiru Weerasekara said the GMOA can have its own opinion over the SAITM struggle irrespective of the IUSF?s opinion.
?We will appreciate it if the GMOA continued to stay with us, but we do not have any grudge now that they have opted out of the struggle. The student movement has no reason to trust either Rajitha or the Government, though the GMOA has done so,? he said.
Mr. Weerasekara said any ally could breakaway from the alliance and the tempo of the fight could change by such moves.
?We no longer believe that discussions with the authorities will help in resolving the matter,? he said and added that the IUSF would continue its struggle and had no faith in discussions. ?We will support any ally in any justifiable struggle but if anyone betrayed the struggle they will have to bear the results as well," he said.

The rickshaw that had been used for the transport of mail bags since colonial times up to the year 1972, between the Gampaha railway station and the Gampaha post office which was situated close to the Gampaha ?Gal palliya? (rock church) in those days, is kept for public exhibition at the Gampaha main post office.? ?
It has been used for public service as well as for the transport of goods until recently from the time Sri Lanka gained independence and also during the colonial times.? ?
It was the rickshaw puller who rendered the service of drawing the rickshaw with the travellers and their goods in those days. At that time, he was paid a mere pittance for that service. Specially, the elite people who lived in the city of Colombo used this vehicle for travelling. That was the pristine glory of rickshaw travelling.?

U.S. lifts ban on refugees from ?high-risk? nations
	
The Trump administration said Monday that it will resume accepting refugees from 11 nations whose applicants it designated ?high-risk? and will implement tougher screening procedures to weed out potential extremists and criminals.
Would-be refu?gees fleeing some of the world?s most searing conflicts will face more extensive background checks from U.S. screeners, according to senior administration officials, and the government will move to implement what it characterized as a more rigorous model for identifying possible threats.
?These additional security measures will make it harder for bad actors to exploit our refugee program, and they will ensure we take a more risk-based approach to protecting the homeland,? Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in a statement.
?The United States must continue to fulfill its obligation to the global community to assist those facing persecution and do so in a manner that addresses the security of the American people,? she said.
The new measures will include additional interviews of applicants? family members and close scrutiny of potential ties to organized crime, senior U.S. officials said in a conference call with reporters Monday.
U.S. standards for refugee acceptance are already considered some of the toughest in the world, and the process typically takes one to two years. Critics of the administration view the additional screening measures as part of President Trump?s broader goal of limiting all forms of immigration to the United States, especially from majority-Muslim countries.
The Trump administration has refused to identify the 11 nations it considers high-risk, citing ?law enforcement sensitivities.? But officials with knowledge of the list say it includes Egypt, Iran, Libya, South Sudan, Yemen, Sudan, Iraq, Mali, North Korea, Somalia and Syria.
All but North Korea and South Sudan are majority-Muslim.
A senior U.S. official insisted Monday that the high-risk determination for the 11 nations ?has nothing to do with religion.?
When he campaigned for president, Trump said that he would ban Muslims from entering the United States and that violent extremists could be slipping into the country with a ?massive inflow of refugees.?
Once in office, Trump froze refu?gee admissions and capped the number the United States would accept at 45,000 per year, the lowest total since the Refugee Act was created in 1980.
The United States resumed admitting refu?gees in October, but the White House ordered the DHS to continue tightly restricting applicants from 11 nations it deemed the most risky, saying it needed an additional 90 days to further assess screening procedures.
?Making good on his campaign promises, Trump called for an ?extreme vetting? system to make sure ?radical Islamic terrorists? were not sneaking in with those fleeing wars, persecution and violence.
Senior officials said U.S. screeners will recommence interviews with high-risk applicants during the second quarter of 2018 and have resumed processing applications from those countries.
The enhanced security measures will also increase information sharing among the U.S. agencies tasked with vetting refu?gee applicants, according to administration officials. The high-risk list will be reviewed every six months, and countries could be added or removed based on evolving assessments of security threats to the United States. (Washington Post)

## Title: UNP guilty  of bond scam  both by commission and omission -Prof. Rajiva Wijesinha

UNP guilty  of bond scam  both by commission and omission -Prof. Rajiva Wijesinha
	
?
Former MP Prof. Rajiva Wijesinha, who served in the COPE during the previous Parliament, in an interview with the Daily mirror? spoke about the bond scam in the Central Bank and of other happenings in the political front. Following are excerpts of the interview done with Prof. Wijesinha.?
Q As a member of the COPE during the previous Parliament, how do you compare and contrast investigations into the bond scam now and then?
?
We were given an unusual task as members of the COPE in 2015, but despite limitations I think we did a good job. This was despite COPE being unable to question Ministers ? typically Ranil declared that he was willing to give evidence, but we had not invited him, though presumably he knew full well he could not be summoned.? ?
I must pay tribute to the sterling support given by the Auditor General?s Department and the honest and sometimes even emotional evidence of Central Bank staff, especially Deepa Seneviratne who almost cried when she recalled how she had been bullied by Mahendran (but had the courage to note his direct involvement in the note her Department prepared, a fact completely ignored by the rascally Pitipana Commission).? ?
?
I should also note that Sujeewa Senasinghe and Rosy Senanayake were contracted by Ranil to disrupt proceedings. As told to the Chairman by another UNP member, Sujeewa and Rosy had behaved appallingly in front of the witnesses who testified about Mahendran?s appalling behaviour.? ?
?
But when we were trying to issue the report, Ranil ensured that Parliament was dissolved. The President must take responsibility for letting him off the hook then and allowing a further scam to take place in 2016. But we were told that he had been pressurized by foreign envoys, who thus made clear their contempt for the claim that this Government was against corruption.? ?
?
Sadly, as you know, the next COPE was not put in place for six more months. Though I believe Sunil Handunetti did a good job the report came too late to save the country from the second plundering. And though his report, and the Auditor General?s scathing denunciation of what Mahendran had done, came out before Mahendran?s term was up, the fact that the Prime Minister tried to retain Mahendran is ample proof of his complicity.? ?
?
I think former President Rajapaksa has now realized the appalling nature of the most culpable of those to whom he gave excessive powers. Sajin de Vaas Goonewardena and Mohan Pieris, had nothing to recommend except be obsequious and ambitious. I can only hope that President Sirisena is equally perceptive
?
QThe UNP maintains that it?s absolved of any wrongdoing in the bond scam. What is your view?
?
Obviously the UNP is guilty, by commission as well as omission. Ranil appointing Mahendran and then clinging on to him, the visit of UNP party officials (including Malik Samarawickrema who was not a Minister at the time) to the Bank to demand money which Mahendran used as an excuse for ordering that an excessive amount be taken at high interest, Ranil continuing defence of Mahendran through the Pitipana Committee, Ravi accepting a gift which he pretended not to know and then allowing further plundering in 2016, all indicate its total involvement.  ? ?
?
QYou were among the few members who defected from the then Government along with current President Maithripala Sirisena. How do you feel now?
?
I am very sorry that the ideals which were at the forefront then have been so conclusively betrayed. However, though the President must shoulder a share of the blame, I think he was totally misled by those around him. And just as I still feel that we should not criticize former President Rajapaksa excessively given the culpability of those around him, the same goes for President Sirisena.? ?
?
I think President Rajapaksa has now realized the appalling nature of the most culpable of those to whom he gave excessive powers. Sajin de Vaas Goonewardena and Mohan Pieris, had nothing to recommend except be obsequious and ambitious. I can only hope that President Sirisena is equally perceptive. But in his case the worst influences on him were made by Ranil Wickremesinghe and Chandrika Kumaratunga, hence whether he will have the guts to show both the door is a moot point.??
?
With regard to your question, you should note that it?s now clear that Vasantha Senanayake and I were the only individuals from within the past Government to support Sirisena for idealistic reasons, the others being either bitter about how former President Rajapaksa neglected things or unashamedly plundered wealth with no concern for the country, the latter being obvious through the squandering of state resources for an unused office for the Ministry of Agriculture. And the fact that only Duminda Dissanayake and I remained with the UPFA among those who supported Sirisena at the beginning ? Vasantha Senanayake was forced out by a bizarre conspiracy between Mangala and Chandrika and hence appallingly treated ? speaks volumes about the President now claiming that he is the guardian of SLFP values.? ?
?
QThere are footnotes added to the COPE report on the controversial bond transaction. In your view, what is the real intention of these UNP members who placed footnotes on the report?? ?
?
They were trying to suggest that there were flaws in the report, but clearly they failed in that effort. Now the footnotes are remembered only to register the complicity in the scam of those UNP members. It?s noteworthy that this time they left Eran Wickremaratne out of the COPE, perhaps realizing that he is too honest to defend shady behaviour. He would make a good Finance Minister perhaps, which is the post he should have had. This would have been so had Ranil not been so bitter about his role in ensuring that Ranil didn?t contest the 2015 Presidential elections.? ?
?
QThe President said he would take steps to enact legislations to recover the monies lost to the state. How feasible is it?? ?
?
It will not be difficult at all if the President is determined and finds the right people to advise him. But it would be best if he did not pursue retribution, but rather worked for restoration, which is what the country needs regarding this and in other respects. Back in 2015 I advocated that we should not press for punishment, but instead ensure transparency by publishing the assets declarations of all public figures, and then allowing people to question them. Anyone found to be unusually rich, as the Thais term it, would be given the option of returning excessive wealth, in exchange for an amnesty. The failure of this Government to have a proper Right to Information Act, and then preventing the operation of even what they have, as when the Prime Minister?s Secretary refused to release his Declaration, shows that they are not really interested in eradicating corruption.? ?
?
You will remember that there was some hype recently about the recommendations of the Global Forum on Asset Recovery, which recommended diverting ?stolen assets to building new permanent assets for public good?. They also suggest the ?non-conviction based forfeiture? of stolen assets and the ?reversal of the burden of proof?. These seem to have been forgotten now and I can understand those who represented the Government at the Forum being told to keep quiet about all this. But if the President is serious he can easily move towards setting up swift mechanisms for restorative justice. Indeed, there is no need to punish even Ravi provided his apartment and other ill gotten gains are given to the public.? ?
?
It?s noteworthy that this time they left Eran Wickremaratne out of the COPE, perhaps realizing that he is too honest to defend shady behaviour. He would make a good Finance Minister perhaps, which is the post he should have had
?
QThe UNP maintains that no loss has been caused because there are enough and more financial assets of Perpetual Treasuries Ltd that have been frozen. What is your response?? ?
?
The various positions taken up by the UNP is pitiful. Malik says there is no loss to the country, while Ranil says there is a loss, but the frozen assets of Perpetual Treasuries will cover the loss. He even tries to take credit for the freezing, though it happened so late. And the fact that he is displaying his usual ignorance was made obvious by the recent decision to freeze even more, since obviously what had been frozen would not have made up the amount including a fine that the Commission indicates will be required.? ?
?
QWhat is the legality involved in prosecuting former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran responsible for this scam?? ?
?
I am afraid I don?t know the legal position, but I have no doubt that laws can be introduced to ensure that justice is done. You also of course have the problem of extradition, but I would assume the Singapore Government would not stand in the way of ensuring prosecution when there is such a clear prima facie case. And I would assume you could introduce strict penalties if he continues to dodge facing trial.? ?
?
?
The various positions taken up by the UNP is pitiful. Malik says there is no loss to the country, while Ranil says there is a loss, but the frozen assets of Perpetual Treasuries will cover the loss

Violating temperance for a ?worthy? cause
	
?
This character is a secretarial one of a very high political authority and his main job is promoting and fostering national unity and harmony.??

He got egg on his face recently when his young son caught distilling pot-arrack.
The young man was manufacturing the hot stuff not for sale. It was for a hospitability cause; for serving the hoi polloi attending the election propaganda meetings which the political boss is billed to address.?
