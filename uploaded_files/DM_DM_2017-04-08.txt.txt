Aluthgamage rejects Ranjan's allegations
	
Joint opposition MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage yesterday rejected the allegation made by Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake that he had bought a house in England saying the Bribery Commission (BC) had proved him innocent.
He said that the Bribery Commission and the CID had conducted an investigation which showed that he was in no way connected.
The MP said he had disclosed these matters in his 2009 Assets and Liabilities declaration.
"My brother Vijayananda Aluthgamage, who is in Japan purchased that house to help his two children studying in England. After this government came into power, I was accused of owning a house in England. My brother was brought to the BC and CID with regard to the incident and he produced proof of his earnings to purchase that house," he said.
Mr. Aluthgamage said the CID had conducted an investigation and forwarded it to the Attorney General, but they only managed to file a case against him two weeks ago saying that he had obtained Rs. 3.9 million from a Trade Union.
"The CID filed that case after I urged it to take action against me. The government kept on calling us thieves for the past two years. But they only managed to file a case against me for obtaining Rs.3.9 million from a Trade Union ," he said.
He challenged Mr. Ramanayake to talk about fraud and corruption by UNP ministers including the Prime Minister, within the UNP parliamentary group meeting.
He said he was ready to face any legal action.
"I am a businessman. I own several companies," he said. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Collapse of school roof not our responsibility: Akila
	
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said yesterday the ministry was not responsible for the collapse of the roof of a school in Kandy.
He said it was the result of the provincial councils not adhering to the criteria set by the ministry.
The minister said his ministry had decided to develop 7,000 schools out of the 10,161 schools under the concept of "nearest is the best school" on the recommendations of responsible authorities, but the stipulated criteria in selecting schools under this concept had been changed by some of the provincial councils.
In response to a question asked by UNP MP Lucky Jayawardane, the minister said the ministry had called for a report from the provincial councils on this matter.
"There cannot be buildings with thatched roofs or in a dilapidated state. This has happened due to the bad practice adopted by some of the provincial councils," he said. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

## Title: Developing a  National  Export Strategy
## Section: News Features

Developing a  National  Export Strategy
	
Sri Lankas First National Symposium to Develop a National Export Strategy was held at the Temple Trees recently on April 6 and 7. The event was conducted by the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade and the Sri Lanka Export Development Board. 
The Governments vision is for Sri Lanka to be the next economic success story in Asia. Thus, exports play a vital role, if not the only option available for the country. Although the fundamental aspects have been discussed at almost all forums and throughout the past decades, Sri Lanka has not been able to reap the benefits of exports for a number of limitations. 
"We are in the process of transforming from a debt  financed public investment and import substitution economy to a private sector led export and FDI led development strategy"

Sri Lankas growth since independence had a high level of volatility with the annual growth rate averaging at around 4.7%. Above 7% growth has been witnessed during short spells, especially during 2010 to 2012, following the end of the conflict. 
Exports too witnessed a high growth during this period. However, it has declined steadily from 27% of GDP in 2000to 13.4% of GDP by 2015. Also the expected FDI rate was 4.5% of GDP, but this is in reality, it was only 1.4% 
Post conflict Sri Lanka had a significant level of optimism in terms of export growth, which was short lived. Therefore, achieving sustained high growth is a serious challenge. 
The Government has taken this challenge on board and is working on a multifaceted economic policy framework which will integrate to create an enabling environment for long term growth and the benefits will trickle down to all levels of the society, building long term sustainability and economic prosperity to all. 
We are in the process of transforming from a debt  financed public investment and import substitution economy to a private sector led export and FDI led development strategy. 
Given the size of the small market of 21 million people in the country, the growth potential for Sri Lanka inevitably lies in global integration. To benefit from opening itself up for trade, Sri Lankas products and services will need to not only successfully compete domestically, but also in the highly competitive international market. 
Global trading environment is changing rapidly with global production networks and global value chains. These developments are a result of product fragmentation; cross boarder dispersion of component production/assembly. Each country specializes in a particular stage of production sequence and trade the value added components which ultimately result in final product.

"It is imperative that Sri Lanka finds new markets and carve out easy market access"
Integration into the Global Production Network is vital for Sri Lanka to switch to export oriented industrialization where economies of scale could be reaped and more foreign exchange earned. Export growth cannot be achieved through traditional export markets as demand is slack in these countries. The slow growth of exports is also due to the very little diversification of the product basket. 
Therefore, it is imperative that Sri Lanka finds new markets and carve out easy market access. 
The deepening of the existing FTA with India and Pakistan and working out new FTAs with growing Asian countries such as China and Singapore will create access to a market of over three billion. 
Sri Lankas agreements with these countries will give companies located in Sri Lanka preferential access to a large market. 
Broadening and deepening the India-Sri Lanka FTA via the proposed Economic and TechnologyCo-operation Agreement (ETCA) will certainly assist Sri Lanka to address most of the current problems it is facing in fully utilizing the FTA. 


"The Governments vision is for Sri Lanka to be the next economic success story in Asia"

The ETCA negotiations are addressing outstanding non-tariff barriers in the Indian market as well as many other existing procedural barriers and delays in Indian ports of entry. 
For export promotion FDIs will support and enhance the supply capacity of and make the best use of market access gained via FDIs. These are the avenues for new business and quality products. Making this transition from debt-financial public investment and import substations to private sector led export and FDI  based development strategy remains challenging. But it is the only option available for Sri Lanka. 
In this context developing of a national strategy for exports is a key component of the development agenda of the Government. 
The strategy will be designed to provide a prioritized five year action oriented framework for trade development and competitiveness. It will focus on a number of priority sectors, selected based on quantitative and qualitative analysis of Sri Lankas export competitiveness to ensure prioritized focus. It will also support the economic vision of strengthening the competitiveness of the countrys private sector to achieve inclusive and sustainable growth. 
A number of international organizations such as the World Bank, ComSec, Harvard, CID (Centre for International Development)and ADB have undertaken several studies and identified different sectors as promising and future visionary sectors to boost export growth.


"Post conflict Sri Lanka had a significant level of optimism in terms of export growth, which was short lived"

Key competitiveness constraints and opportunities at the National level and along the identified priority sectors, value chains, including selected service sectors, as well as cross-sectoral fundamental areas in institutional infrastructure for export promotions, logistics etc. will also be looked at. 
This National endeavour is spearheaded by the Sri Lanka Export Development Board under the strategic guidance of my Ministry (MODSIT) and of course with the total involvement of the private sector. 
The International Trade Centre has joined hands with us in developing the strategy by providing a combination of advisory and capacity building inputs and specialized expertise to ensure the NES is of the highest quality and validated by the relevant authorities in Sri Lanka. 
Sri Lankan companies, especially SMEs generally lack the knowledge and experience required to adopt and adapt new technologies and thereby develop new/higher value added products and services to address domestic and international market opportunities. Thus, they are unable to access the global value chains which may offer them the opportunity to sell their products and services in the global market. 
It is evident that we cannot tackle all the challenges in isolation. Therefore, we need to come on to one platform where we can have a holistic approach.

"Broadening and deepening the India-Sri Lanka FTA via the proposed Economic and Technology Co-operation Agreement (ETCA) will certainly assist Sri Lanka to address most of the current problems"

Hindered though he was, the world was his oyster
	
Some men forget to live. Some others life forgets. And there are some, a few, that life can never even when it denies them things, most people take for granted. My brother, I think was such. 
He, my only brother, younger to me, Indeevara Kanishka Kumara Samarakoon, passed away last December when he was exactly fifty years and two months old. He suffered from a genetic condition called pseudo miss him. 
Although he very rarely went out of home, the large numbers of men and women and children, who not only showered him with the warmth of true friendship but also benefited themselves from my brothers encyclopaedic knowledge, show that one does not necessarily have to travel around the world to bring the world and the good things in life, to ones feet. One of the lessons, he taught us with his comparatively short life is that, you can do it, if you know how to, without moving your feet. 
My brother knew how to do it. It was proved time and again and during the final journey of my brother too. The gentleman who spoke for the Centenary Group of Dharmaraja College, Kandy, my brothers class-mate, said that people gathered many things in life and finally departed leaving them, but Samare although he did not gather many things, departed taking with him, the thoughts he created in the minds of many of them, of a truly great life. He exercised, truly his kind of magic in attracting the good hearts that beat in this world. 
I heard many people say, that Samare never complained about his illness. This trait, which I knew as perhaps his oldest and first friend and play-mate, reminds me of the jovial, practical and matter-of-fact spirit in which he took it, which now makes me see his singular courage and brightness of soul. 


"I heard many people say, that Samare never complained about his illness"

He initially attended Trinity College, Kandy but as he often told my parents that he wanted to go to his elder brothers school, he came to Dharmaraja. When the progressive nature of the muscle disease affected him more, however, he went to St. Anthonys Boys School, Katugastota, as Dharmaraja was on a hill and later completed his school education at D. S. Senanayake Vidyalaya in Colombo, as he attended physiotherepy treatment in a Colombo hospital. Despite these several changes, he secured a place in the physical science stream at Peradeniya University and obtained a BSc Degree. 
My brother was deeply interested in history. He remembered the exact years of the reigns of many kings in the country, in India and Europe, together with a philosophical analysis, of their times. He set the example that knowledge is not limited to any particular field or discipline. When I saw the Sinhalese translation made by my brother of the poem Ozymandias by the English romantic poet Percy Byssi Shelley, I wondered how the two sides of his mind, his extraordinary ability and his deeply intuitive artistic nature, blended to create a work of such perfection. 
He excelled in literary composition including poetry, which I think he inherited from our parents. 
My name Is Ozymandias, King of Kings; Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair! 
But there is nothing except trunkless legs of stone and a shattered visage. Only the lone and level sands stretch far away. 
Works of stone and brick cannot weather the ravages of time. Yet, the good thoughts created by my beloved brother when alive, embossed like precious gems in his immortal prose and verse, will be read over and over again, by generations. His mind will live again and again, to the end of time.

## Title: Increase Palk Bay patrol, Colombo tells New Delhi

Increase Palk Bay patrol, Colombo tells New Delhi
	
Sri Lanka on Friday asked India to increase the patrol of the Palk Bay to prevent Tamil Nadu fishermen from trespassing into Sri Lankan waters, even as it expressed positive signs on the likely release of detained Indian trawlers.
The meeting was very useful. We are happy that India is really committed to its assurance of phasing out bottom trawlers and has taken constructive steps. We are very hopeful of finding a permanent solution together, a senior officer from the Sri Lankan delegation told The Hindu after official teams from the countries met in Colombo as part of an initiative to jointly address the Palk Bay fisheries conflict, involving fishermen of Tamil Nadu and northern Sri Lanka.
After the islands civil war ended in May 2009, fisher folk living in the Tamil majority Northern Province have been expressing serious concern over the loss of livelihoods due to relentless bottom trawling  a destructive fishing method  practised by Indian fishermen, reportedly, in the Sri Lankan waters.
The long-running conflict has resulted in the arrest of several hundred Indian fishermen since 2009, and at times, sparked violence at sea. The Sri Lankan Navy has also confiscated trawlers used by the fishermen.
Britjo's death
At Fridays meeting, the Indian side expressed deep concern over the fatal shooting of Rameswaram fisherman K. Britjo who set out fishing in the Palk Bay on March 6. Tamil Nadu fishermen have accused the Sri Lankan Navy of opening fire at him and the Navy has denied the charge.
The Indian officials sought a detailed report on the investigation carried out by Sri Lankan agencies and reiterated that no violence should be used against fishermen under any circumstance, sources at the meeting said.
Officials from New Delhi and Tamil Nadu also updated the Sri Lankan side on the initiatives taken, including the construction of two fishing harbours in Mookaiyur and Poompuhar in Tamil Nadu at a cost of over Rs. 250 crore, to phase out bottom trawling and encourage fishermen to consider alternative methods.
Release of trawlers
To the Indian sides request for the release of the seized trawlers, numbering nearly 150, the Sri Lankan officials expressed the willingness to consider it soon. Recently, our Ministry sought the opinion of northern fishermen on this matter, they seem agreeable. But since this is a political decision, it would have to be taken at the highest levels. We are considering the Indias request very seriously, a top Sri Lankan official said.
The release of trawlers remains a contentious issue facing the two countries. Owners of the vessels, based in Tamil Nadu, have been demanding that the Sri Lankan authorities release them. However over the last few years, Sri Lanka has followed a policy of retaining seized Indian trawlers, while releasing arrested Indian fishermen swiftly. It appears that Colombo may release at least some of the trawlers, especially those seized in 2015, in the near future.
Fridays meeting was the second of the ongoing discussions between senior officials from both sides, an initiative running parallel to the ministerial level bilateral talks.(The Hindu)

MiG deal; Udayanga received funds from Panama, Latvia: FCID
	
The FCID informed the Colombo Fort Magistrate yesterday that a few of the bank accounts belonging to Sri Lanka's former ambassador to Russia, Udayanga Weeratunga had received funds from Panama and Latvia.
It said this during the inquiry into the controversial purchase of Ukraine-built MiG-27 aircraft in 2006 causing a huge loss to the State and pointed out that the sources of the funds were questionable.
The FCID said the suspect was said to be residing in the UAE and that an international warrant had been issued for his arrest.
Counsel appearing for the Air Force informed Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne that they were still unable to locate the original purchase contract said to have been signed in the presence of the suspect.
The FCID said its investigations had revealed that funds amounting to a total of US$1.5 million had been deposited at various times to the 16 accounts belonging to him at two private banks. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

REUTERS, 07th APRIL, 2017- The Philippines will upgrade existing facilities on its inhabited islands and reefs in the South China Sea and not occupy new territories, adhering to a 2002 informal code in the disputed waters, defense and military officials said on Friday.
A statement from Philippine President Rodrigo Dutertes office on Thursday said he had ordered troops to occupy uninhabited islands and shoals that the Philippines claims in the disputed waterway, asserting Philippine sovereignty in an apparent change of tack likely to anger China.
The firebrand leader, who on the campaign trail joked that he would jet ski to a Chinese man-made island in the South China Sea to reinforce Manilas claim, also said he may visit a Philippine-controlled island to raise the national flag.
But defense and military officials have subsequently clarified the presidents comments.

Rice import scam: COPE holds both Govts responsible
	
The parliamentary Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) in its report on the investigation into the questionable import of a stock of rice has held both the present and the previous governments responsible for the losses amounting to more than Rs.15 billion.
COPE Chairman Sunil Handunnetti who presented the investigation report to Parliament said the country had lost Rs.15.157 billion as a result of the scam that began in 2012 and continued in 2015 under the present regime. The report revealed that rice was imported to Sri Lanka in 2012, 2013 and in 2015 without Cabinet approval, despite their having been an excess production in these years.
It was also revealed that the cost of living sub-committee during the period 2012 to 2015 had either failed to carry out a proper survey on the supply and demand of rice or had been misled and neither had there been proper stock records.
COPE said the authorities had failed to realise the negative impact on the country's agricultural sector by the import of rice.
The committee had recommended an introduction of a tender procedure to Sathosa and advised the cabinet to ensure the receipt of correct data.
COPE has recommended that those responsible for the scam be penalized and the losses recovered from them. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

SC interim order stays cutting down Pannipitiya Bo-tree
	
A Supreme Court Bench comprising Justices Eva Wanasundera and Anil Gooneratne has issued an interim order, effective till May 9, restraining the Road Development Authority from cutting down the Bo-tree in Pannipitiya on the border of the Colombo-Avissawella Road.
Ven. Weraduwe Sirijothi Thera of the Sri Punnyabiwardana Ramaya in Kottawa and three others filed the fundamental rights petition citing Minister of Higher Education and Highways, the Maharagama Divisional Secretary, the Chairman of the RDA, the Attorney General and some others as respondents.
Kanishka Vitharana with M.Tillekartne appeared for the petitioners.
The petitioners said the history of the Pannipitiya Bo-tree runs dates back to about 400 years and the story of its origin has been transmitted by word of mouth for generations.
They said the RDA had attempted to cut it down in 2015 for the purpose of developing the High-level Road but was foiled by strong public protest and pointed out that cutting down of the Bo-tree would the deprive the residents of the cultural and religious values and violate the fundamental rights to equality and discrimination on the grounds of race, religion, language and caste.
The petitioners said the cutting down of the said Bo-tree would violate the constitutional responsibility of the State to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana and to give the foremost place to Buddhism as provided in the Article 9 of the Constitution. (S.S. Selvanayagam)

Shareefa Haniya Mowlana: Remembering a Phenomenal Lady
	
When females were asked to learn to cook, she wanted us to educate ourselves
This has been a long time coming. Everytime I tried to put pen to paper, words failed me. Like I was attempting to take on a task too gargantuan. It still is, as I struggle to pay homage to a human being par excellence... To sing her praises from the mountains tops... 
Ever since I was a little girl, I always wanted to be like my grandmother. She was very beautiful, as one was likely to notice at that age. Her smile would light up any room. She was made of steel - my superwoman. People looked up to her. Respected her. Loved her. Impressionable as I was, I wanted that. The plaudits. The praise. The respect. The whole nine yards. I even remember telling her, youthful naivete in full force, your children are useless. They are not anywhere as perfect as you are. But one day, I will be like you! Today, several years later, I am nowhere close. Neither am I naive enough to believe it is an achievable ideal. Filling such large shoes is near impossible. But everyday I try to emulate her, do as much good as she did. To be fiercely protective of my family. To love unconditionally and help others as much as I can, never expecting anything in return. 
She was a true feminist. At a time when females were asked to learn to cook, she wanted us to educate ourselves. She taught us the importance of self respect. And she taught us that true equality lay in loving and respecting each other. 

She carried herself with poise and grace
She lost her husband at a relatively young age, but she never let that faze her. She educated her children in the best of schools, and persevered to become a woman to be reckoned with. She carried herself with poise and grace. She exuded charisma. She was always well dressed, her million dollar smile at her disposal. She was the most selfless person I know, always putting everyone else first. She was a nurturing, loving, beautiful, strong woman who always wanted the best for everyone. 
But all the words in the world wont suffice eloquently to describe the person she was. Even now, I look at what Ive written and want to discard it - I havent done near enough justice and I doubt I will ever be able to. 
I dont begrudge her for leaving us so soon. It was always her wish not to be a burden on anyone; to live a life dependent on others. People tell me she was as beautiful and ethereal as she was when she was alive as she was as she lay there, a beautiful smile on her face. No doubt she has left a void in our hearts that can never be filled, but above all, she left behind a legacy. She will always remain in our hearts, thoughts and prayers. My parents Zulkif & Rahana and my siblings Amreeya & Imaad join me in honouring her memory.
May the Almighty grant her Jennathul Firdaus.

Thank you Uncle Rienzie for seeing life through your heart
	
I learnt to be more and more grateful for one tiny thing which most people dont even think about  their eyesight.

When I was young, wild and some may say, out of control, I had possibly one of the greatest blessings in my life forced upon me -- to live with my mothers brother and his family. I did not realise it at the timebut this period in my life was going to be the one where I would learn how to make the impossible, possible, and how to take lifes hardest knocks and turn them into opportunities. Each day, I learnt to be more and more grateful for one tiny thing which most people dont even think about  their eyesight. These were lessons I would carry for life, lessons that helped me through the toughest times and reminded me always, to choose life. 
Moving overnight from an aetheist home to a home where people went to bed at 9 and recited the rosary every night  this was an experience in itself. To be honest, at that time, Uncle Rienzie Benedict was just another adult getting in the way of everything I wanted to do. It was only many years later that I had the time and maturity to really see things through his eyes. 
He was blind for most of his life. Call it whatever fancy term to make it sound better but it was what it was, he could not see any of the things we daily take for granted. Despite this, he had a family, a job, friends and most importantly the skill, compassion and time to help every single person who crossed his path. Most of these are challenges to those who can see. From finding people, domestic help, to looking for school vans, from teaching the deaf to play chess, to managing charity events  his to do list was endless, longer and more varied than any list I have ever seen. 


"One would think that losing your sight would mean losing everything and that life ends there"

Never once did I hear him complain about a single thing he or anyone else was faced with. He was not a man of many words but he did ask a lot of questions from his daughters and myself, trying to figure out what our day had been like. He made up for his lack of sight by absorbing everything he heard. 
Many years later, as I sit here trying to absorb that he is no more, making excuses for not giving him more of my time  I realize that whenever that pang of lacking something hit me, when I wake up with a complaint that its raining or cold or not having something I desired -- Uncle crossed my mind. One would think that losing your sight would mean losing everything and that life ends therebut he showed me and everyone around him that you dont need sight to have love in your heart and be the most caring, compassionate person, changing the lives of those you touched. 
There was a time when the tag line for everything that happened in our family was ask Uncle Rienzie because we knew if he did not have the answer he would make sure he found it for us. I failed to tell this great man in time all the words I should have all these years. Many have been the days when I have battled through life thinking  Uncle Rienzie couldnt even see but still he did so much I must quit whining and get this done. I wish I took the time to tell him how much he helped me to just get through life. 
His legacy lives on, reminding me to take a moment to stop and be grateful whenever I enjoy an amazing sunset or see my child smileto be grateful that I am breathing, writing, living and seeing life. He taught me the greatest lesson of seeing life through your heart, not just your eyes. A man who could not see but still saw more than us - My Uncle Rienzie.

Trump kicks off Florida meetings with Chinese president
	

DAILY MAIL, 07th APRIL, 2017- President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping opened their high-stakes summit at Trumps Florida beach resort Thursday, with the urgent threat of North Koreas nuclear ambitions and tensions over trade on the agenda. 
Xis visit was overshadowed, though, by a U.S. missile barrage on an air base in Syria in response to this weeks chemical weapons attack against civilians, which the U.S. blamed on President Bashar Assad. The U.S. announced the missile attack shortly after Xi and his wife left the Mar-a-Lago estate Thursday night. 
Trump appeared lighthearted earlier Thursday as he greeted Xi at Mar-A-Lago, gesturing and pointing to journalists as they tussled to get a shot of the two leaders together for the
first time. 
Ahead of the dinner, Trump said he and Xi already had a long discussion and had developed a friendship, and then joked, I have gotten nothing,
absolutely nothing.

U.S. fires missiles at Assad airbase
	

The United States fired dozens of cruise missiles at a Syrian airbase on Friday from which it said a deadly chemical weapons attack was launched this week, an escalation of the U.S. military role in Syria that swiftly drew sharp criticism from Russia.
Two U.S. warships fired 59 cruise missiles from the eastern Mediterranean Sea at the Syrian airbase controlled by forces of President Bashar al-Assad in response to a poison gas attack in a rebel-held area on Tuesday, U.S.
officials said.
Facing his biggest foreign policy crisis since his Jan. 20 inauguration, President Donald Trump took the toughest direct U.S. action yet in Syrias six-year-old civil war, raising the risk of confrontation with Russia and Iran, Assads two main military backers.
Russian President Vladimir Putin believes that the missile strikes on a Syrian air base broke international law and have seriously hurt U.S.-Russia relations, news agencies cited the Kremlin
as saying.
The Russian leader regarded the U.S. action as aggression against a sovereign nation on a made-up pretext and as a cynical attempt to distract the world from civilian deaths in Iraq, Putins spokesman Dmitry Peskov was cited as saying.
U.S. officials said they informed Russian forces ahead of the missile attacks and that they took pains to avoid hitting Russian troops at the base, saying there were no strikes on sections of the base where Russians were present. But they said the administration did not seek Moscows approval.

However, it stated that they were yet to officially receive the decisions made by the Higher Education Ministry regarding the issue of South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malabe.
GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda told the Daily Mirror that they would only be able to make a statement on the decisions once they receive them officially by the ministry. He also said that the ministry had still not made any official information to them about those decisions.
We have clearly made 5 demands on the issue. The Higher Education Minister should inform Courts that the SAITM does not have the compliance certificate to offer medical degree. The government should also implement the directives made by the commission appointed by the former health minister to discontinue the medical degree offering by the SAITM, he said.
He said according to the GMOAs demands the government should issue a gazette notification on the minimum standards of the medical education and added that a presidential committee should appointed to offer a justice to the students who were studying at the SAITM. He also said another demand of them was to nationalize the SAITM.
However, he said they were fighting against the SAITM to fulfill these demands and added that they have made these demands with the consent of the Medical Faculty Deans, university teachers and lecturers. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
