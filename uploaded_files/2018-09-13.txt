## Title: As I stand by the ?wewa?

As I stand by the ?wewa?
	
Sinhalese civilisation is nothing without the wewa. It was at once a repository of life and the foundation on which was built a great many marvels of engineering. And yet, from the time of Vijaya?s arrival until the flowering of the Anuradhapura kingdom, our rulers were content with building tanks to conserve the rainfall the villages received.??
The ?flowering? as such of Anuradhapura begins with the reign of Vasabha (AD 67-111), under whom a scheme encompassing 12 reservoirs and 12 canals facilitated the diversion (and not merely conservation) of water from the wewa, paving the path for large-scale irrigation works which became the cornerstone of our way of life.??
I refer to this period as one of a flowering, or a gradual opening up of a new era, because the first seven centuries of the Anuradhapura kingdom, until Dhatusena?s reign (AD 455-473), consolidated gains in the economic and cultural spheres. From Dhatusena?s reign in the fifth century till the seventh and eighth centuries, according to Professor K. M. de Silva, the kingdom matured. There was political instability but that was limited to the occasional entry of Tamil mercenaries. (Not until Raja Raja Chola I captured power in Anuradhapura and with it two-thirds of the island in the eighth century, did those invasions become pivotal to the trajectory of our civilisation.) It is in the early period of the Anuradhapura kingdom, then, that the wewa and tank became identifiers of our civilisation.??
Anuradhapura was the first real base of power of the Sinhalese. But even in its most formative years, it was prone to dynastic conflicts (between the Lambakannas and Moriyas) as well as sprouts of regional patriotism across the island. Unifying the country was, given this, ?more an aspiration than a reality?, particularly since there was no real army with which such instability could be combated (apart from a small force which had among its ranks mercenaries from South India).??
These were obvious disadvantages, and they would dent the kingdom. But it is to the credit of the Sinhalese that, despite the odds against them, they were able to construct a vast network of reservoirs, tanks, and canals buttressed by a device from the third century BC: the ?bisokotuwa?, the inventors of which still haven?t been identified by scholars. This gap in our history, or the inability to source the foundation on which our hydraulic civilisation rests, no doubt led Western theorists to generalise our history rather erroneously. Among them, the Marxists.??

?
Both Marx and Engels wrote copiously on the Asiatic Mode of Production, which remains to this day a seminal part of Marxist literature. The AMP, as it?s referred to casually today, was for Marxist scholars very different to its European counterpart in that it depended for its perpetuation a rift between a powerful State and a society of vassals. The State exerted a monopoly over land and with it an unparalleled level of control over irrigation. Irrigation, therefore, was the most important determinant of such societies, which in later years were to be categorised as ?hydraulic empires? and repositories of ?Oriental despotism?. The writings of Karl Wittfogel are of particular interest here, since he coined if not popularised those two terms in his major work, ?Oriental Despotism: A Comparative Study of Total Power? (first published in 1957).??
Wittfogel lists down certain prerequisites to his theory of the relationship between irrigation and despotism in Asiatic societies. In particular, full aridity, hydraulic enterprises led by the State (a ?hydraulic bureaucracy?), and ?staticity?. He does not, curiously, mention Sri Lanka, which is just as well, since Sri Lanka and Burma were home to irrigation systems which rebelled against his theoretical framework.??
And here?s why. Sri Lanka was never fully arid (it was dependent on two seasons, alternating between rainfall and aridity). Its irrigation and hydraulic schemes were, while built from the centre, never really retained by it (the tanks, once completed, would sometimes be ceded to a private party, if not ?gifted? to a monastery). Most importantly, it was never ?static?, in the sense that except for the last few centuries of the Anuradhapura kingdom (when construction of tanks and reservoirs came to a standstill owing to diminishing trade), it continued to evolve, and sporadically so.??
The truth is that the Marxists, like the Orientalists after them, attempted, without much success, to generalise the culture and mode of production in societies very different to theirs. It cannot be said that Marxists harboured a bias against Asiatic civilisations, but many of them were sceptical of the potential of those civilisations to grow out of their supposedly ?arrested? stage of historical development. They consequently tended to view the ?hydraulic empire? by which countries like Sri Lanka prospered as evidence of feudal totalitarianism, of a powerful State which wielded absolute power against its own subjects. When, of course, the reality was very different.??
The Oriental despotism model assumed that once a civilisation was determined by those who had a monopoly over access to water, it would regress to if not remain in stasis. According to this view, land ownership was the preserve of the State. In Sri Lanka, this was not the case.??
It has already been pointed out that the irrigation works of the Anuradhapura Era did not always revert to the State once they were completed. (To give just one example, it is said that after the completion of the Kala Wewa, Dhatusena ceded half its income to his brother.) But that is not all. In actual fact, there was never really a feudal system in Sri Lanka. While the principles of freehold tenure did not make inroads until the advent of the British, there are records which conclusively prove that a regime of private property was in place in Anuradhapura, which went hand in hand with the maturing of a hydraulic civilisation. Inscriptions from the ninth century AD, for instance, describe a kind of tenure called ?pamunu?, which roughly correspond to the modern system of ?heritable right in perpetuity?. After the ninth century, this gave way to the ?divel? system, which effectively empowered a manorial class dependent on the patronage of the king. It was a definitive precursor to the ?rajakariya? or ?free labour? system, the closest to feudalism that Sinhalese civilisation came to.??
And yet, even here, there was never really the kind of feudal aristocracy that was spreading itself out around the time in much of Europe. The prerequisites to such an aristocracy were simply not in place here. On the other hand, scholars like Bryce Ryan contend that the classes of land tenure here did correspond to the feudal regime which ran riot in Medieval Europe. In any case, whatever the conclusion, it cannot be held that the intricate system of tanks and reservoirs our kings pioneered was not based on land tenure, however different it may have been to its Western counterpart.? ?
After the British annexed Kandy, the authorities, barring governors like Maitland and North who tried to continue the irrigation works (but failed), professed ignorance of and indifference towards agriculture. That was only to be expected, because having abolished the rajakariya system in 1832 and instituted minor courts in 1843, they had disturbed the foundation on which the agricultural life of this country had subsisted.??
The ancient Sinhalese devised a legal system which, while largely oral, dispensed justice in a less bureaucratic manner than the British did. At the lower end of the hierarchy were the gamsabhawas, which was based on unity among the community, and from which one could resort to the ratasabhawa, state officials, and monarch. One characteristic of this hierarchy was that we never separated our legal system from our way of life, and we never secularised it as the British did. Owing to this, the irrigation works which nourished us were, barring the occasional period of neglect, kept alive.??
So once the gamsabhawas were abolished through the establishment of minor courts, those works began to collapse. And why? Because the gamsabhawa centred on the vel vidane, who while a minor official, had the ability to marshal village labour towards the construction and repair of tanks and reservoirs. When the community was forcibly removed, with it went that official and the ability to marshal that labour.??
Having noted the destruction they had facilitated through these minor courts, Henry Ward (Governor from 1855 to 1860) thus endeavoured with John Bailey (soon to be his own son-in-law) to revive the gamsabhawa by enacting the controversial Paddy Lands Irrigation Ordinance No. 9 in 1855. But while commendable, the Ordinance was short-lived: it achieved what it set out to achieve in terms of the amount of land cultivated, capped adequate returns, empowered communities, and was extended for another five years with the enactment of the Paddy Lands Irrigation Ordinance No 9 of 1861. And yet, despite this, Ward?s successor Charles McCarthy discontinued the grants-in-aid that had hitherto been extended to the project.??
The truth was that despite Ward?s enthusiasm, the motives of the colonial authorities were different and vastly so: administrators were never interested in agricultural life. They were more concerned with setting up a plantation sector, through which they could squeeze profits more easily back to the centre of the Empire. With the British, as was expected, Sinhalese civilisation had, effectively and definitively,?dried up.??

B report: Voucher relating to Rs. 10 mn cheque paid to Ravi K among destroyed
	
Filing a B report in Court, the prosecution informed court today that according to a statement submitted by a W.M. Mendis & Company?s finance officer, the ?voucher? relating to the Rs. 10 million cheque paid to the ?Global Towers Company?- which has a connection to Former Minister Ravi Karunanayake- was also among those vouchers which had been destroyed.
The Prosecution has stated this based on a statement given by Sujith Alwis (Finance Manager of W.M. Mendis & Company), who had confessed before the CID on August 31, 2018.
He had also revealed that he was aware that Arjun Aloysius had instructed W.M. Mendis & Company CEO, Suneth Abeykoon in the latter part of 2017 to destroy the voucher related to the particular payment which Mr. Karunanayake had received through Mr. Sinniah.
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda revealed that 102 original vouchers relating to transactions between WM Mendis & Company and third parties had been destroyed and replaced by some officers of the company upon the instructions of its CEO in November 2017, while the Bond Commission was in progress.

Bond scam: '102 original vouchers of WM Mendis destroyed'
	
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda today revealed that some 102 original vouchers relating to the transactions between WM Mendis & Company and third parties had been destroyed and replaced by some Finance officers of the company upon the instructions of its CEO in November 2017, while the Bond Commission was in progress.
The ASG revealed this based on the confessional statements given by three officers of WM Mendis & Company namely, Sujith Alwis (Finance Manager), Buddi Sankalpa Perera (Audit Manager) and Sivasundaram Harisam (officer at Finance Division) to the CID recently.
Earlier, WM Mendis & Company had given a set of vouchers relating to the transactions it made with third parties to the CID for its investigation, which conducted into the alleged suspicious transactions that Perpetual Treasuries Ltd had made with its related company, WM Mendis & Company to release money/payments to third parties.
However, according to the statements given by those officers, some of these vouchers (physical documents) had been already replaced altering its true transaction details in November before handing them over to the CID.
ASG Kodagoda said, these three officers who had confessed, had also been involved in the destroying process of the 102 vouchers upon the instructions of their CEO at the Board Room of the Company by using a shredding machine.
At the onset of the inquiry, ASG Kodagoda drew the Court's attention to an incident that the CID and the officers of the Government Analysts Department had to undergo when deploying an investigation at the WM Mendis & Company over its central computer data server.
The CID had deployed this exercise upon the direction of the court to get a cloned copy of the data base in expectation of searching all details relating the payment system of WM Mendis & Company.
According to ASG Kodagoda, Chief Operating Officer of WM Mendis & Company, Savith Kalupathirana had obstructed the government officers to conduct their investigation when the officers went to get a clone copy of the server.
The ASG further said that WM Mendis & Company had then provided the CID a lap top containing data relating to its payment system by copying from the main server to get the cloning done.
However, the ASG was of the view that what the prosecution specifically required to do is to get a clone copy of the main data server to compare with the vouchers that the CID already have and to see the nature of those particular 102 transactions and more.
However, the Counsel who appeared for WM Mendis & Company denied the allegation and said that they have provided the CID full cooperation.
The Counsel was of the view that their payment system and the data base was not separated and therefore, there was a difficulty in providing a third party to get a copy of its server, since it comprised with also business sensitive and private information about their clients and employees.
Considering both parties requests, Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne directed to get down the experts from the Government Analyst department and the company which provided services to the data system to understand how the data system of WM Mendis & Company can be cloned.
Meanwhile, ASG Kodagoda also invited the Court to consider taking legal action against Chief Operating Officer of WM Mendis & Company, Savith Kalupathirana, who had allegedly obstructed the government officers duties at WM Mendis & Company premises over the offence of Contempt of Court for not obeying the court order. He also pointed out that the CID can also parallelly initiate actions against him under the section 183 of the Penal Code for obstructing their duties.
Meanwhile, Perpetual Treasuries Ltd owner Arjun Aloysius and its CEO Kasun Palisena were also ordered to be re-remanded till September 27 by the magistrate over the magisterial inquiry in which they were accused of abetting and conspiring with Arjuna Mahendran to misappropriate public funds worth Rs. 688 million during the Bond auction held on February 27, 2015.
Perpetual Treasuries Ltd defacto owner Arjun Aloysius, its CEO Kasun Palisena were also re-remanded by the Fort Magistrate till September 27 over the parallel magisterial inquiry conducted relating to the Bond scam on deleting phone call data from Perpetual Treasuries Ltd voice recording system and fabricating evidence to the Bond Commission.
On the instructions of Senior Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda, Senior Deputy Solicitor General Haripriya Jayasundara, Senior State Counsel lakmini Girihagama and State Counsel Sahanya Narampanawa appeared for the prosecution, while President's Counsel Kalinga Indatissa, President's Counsel Anil Silva, Senior Counsel Jeewantha Jayathilake, Counsel Ralitha Amarasena and Counsel Theruni Fernando appeared for the defense.

Building National Harmony: A cardinal duty of the Govt.
	
?It is praiseworthy that the editor has highlighted a burning issue with the above title in ?OUR THOUGHT? in the DM issue of Tuesday 11th September. As stated quite rightly, the lack of trust on the peace efforts of the government during the past four decades is the principal cause of failure. Two Parliamentary Select Committees, one in 1984 and the other in 1994 failed in their task, despite the huge expenditure incurred.? ??
The year 2015 saw the birth of two ministries, targeting national harmony. Three years has passed and are we anywhere near the target?? ??
Apart from these two more bodies namely, the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) and Secretariat for Coordinating Reconciliation Mechanisms (SCRM) have been established for the same purpose.?
Creation of entities will not serve the purpose unless the masses are mobilised. There should be mass scale activity towards reconciliation and every opportunity must be grabbed and availed of.? ? It must be remembered that many an activity goes on at grass root level with the active participation of all nationalities and religious groups, hardly known to those at the helm of those entities created by the government. Those manning the government entities may not be very knowledgeable of the subject, as often they are selected not on their expertise but on other considerations and hence doomed to fail; being government entities, large sums of people?s hard earned money are allocated, which go down the drain. Not achieving the target jeopardizes the future of the nation too.? ??
One such voluntary activity started about 35 years ago by Messrs Yogendra Duraisamy and Bogoda Premaratne, when on the occasion of the National New Year, people of all faiths and nationalities assembled at the Vajiraramaya Buddhist Temple in Bambalapitiya, after offering flowers and lighting lamps they march to the Kathiresan Hindu Kovil in Wellawatte, participate in the Pooja and disperse after fellowship; a tremendous show of harmony in society. This annual activity has gone on uninterrupted, to date. These should be encouraged in other parts of the country as well.? ??
Big peraheras in Buddhist temples are organized and held colourfully with the help of people of all faiths in the respective areas. It is the same with big feasts in Christian churches. These activities need enhancement and encouragement from the government. We have even seen Muslims in certain areas organizing and participating in Danselas during Wesak and Poson.? ??
?
The year 2015 saw the birth of two ministries, targeting national harmony
?
Even local temperance societies (amadyapa saba) with membership of all nationalities and faiths have existed, spread throughout the country, functioning for over half a century. If these are encouraged and empowered they would create a big impact. Instead what happens is that entities such as ?Mathata thitha? and Presidential Task Force for drug abuse are created and stuffed with lackeys who lack sincerity and have no direction or vision pertaining to the task in hand, resulting in their failure and even abandonment midway, with loss of large sums of money voted for such activities.? ? Our National Holidays too can be utilized meaningfully to achieve National Harmony. Of the 25 declared National Holidays each year, 23 are connected with events of Religious and National importance. If these holidays are re-structured and activity encouraged to enable everyone to participate in the commemoration of each other?s events, it would be a big leap in achieving harmony.? ??
Language teaching/learning goes on in a big way, supposedly with the intention of creating harmony. What have we achieved? Sinhala people learn Tamil and Tamils learn Sinhala as stipulated by the government, in order to pass the proficiency bar; the matter ends there with them earning their proficiency and related salary increments. The language is forgotten soon after and does not in any way promote harmony. Instead there should be incentives for people to use the language in conversation; conversing in a language makes its study easy and brings the people closer too.
Let?s give serious thought to build National Harmony. In this direction, no stone should be left unturned, lose no time, for it is only National Harmony that will ensure a united Sri Lanka, and a contented people.

Cashews issue- President should have acted with responsibility: JO
	
The Joint Opposition (JO) today said President Maithripala Sirisena should have acted in a more responsible manner when dealing with the incident where he was treated with cashews unsuitable for consumption during his recent trip with Sri Lankan Airlines.
JO MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage told a news conference that the Sri Lankan Airlines may run into huge loss because of President Sirisena?s controversial statement since it was also reported through international media.
?We regret the fact that President Sirisena has made such a statement regarding the national airline service in the country. President Sirisena should have informed the management or relevant authorities over this issue if those cashews were not fit to consume,? he said.
?This statement will have a negative impact on the Sri Lankan Airlines business activities. As the President, it would have been better if President Sirisena could have talked in a more responsible manner,? he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Chinese loans amount to 8%, rest are from West and others: MR
	
The amount of loans Sri Lanka obtained from China is only about 8 per cent from the total loan amount and the rest of the loans are from the Western and other countries, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who is in India said.
In an interview with News X, Mr.Rajapaksa said if he is not mistaken, Chinese loans only amounted to 8 per cent.
He said Sri Lankans today complained of lack of development in the country and the previous government was able to initiate many development projects.
When asked whether the Hambantota Port?s feasibility study proved to be not viable, he said it was not so.
?Now everybody is interested in it. Not only India, Pakistan or China, everybody wants to come there. It is a very important port. Now they have realised it. Even the US, that's why they are talking about it,? he said.
He said the previous government never promised China that the Port will be given to them.
?But this government gave it for 99 year lease. We would have settled the loan obtained for the Hambantota port from earnings of Colombo Port,? he said.
When asked about the issues faced by the people of Tamil Community in Sri Lanka, Mr.Rajapaksa said both the regional development and power devolution have to be done.
?We will have to give that. However, Sri Lanka is a small country. We can?t just divide it and give them a federal state. That option is out. Unfortunately, the TNA party leaders didn?t want to come with me and discuss the issues because they thought Ranil will give them a better deal,? he said.
When asked whether he would contest the upcoming presidential election, Mr. Rajapaksa said he has not yet decided whether to contest or not.
?We are looking for a good candidate. If there is no good candidate then I will have to,? he said.

A group called the Sinhalaye Api Jathika Sanvidanaya yesterday lodged a complaint with the National Police Commission against Terrorism Investigations Division DIG Nalaka de Silva alleging that he had allegedly misused his powers to engage in corrupt activities seeking higher ranks in the police department.
Sinhalaye Api Jathika Sanvidanaya President Jamburewela Chandrarathana Thera said the TID was in charge of the investigations into the Digana communal riots and added that DIG De Silva had capitalized the situation in expectation of the IGP's post.
?Some innocent people are still in remand prison over the Digana incident. The TID refuse to grant bail to them. We doubt if the TID had purposely created the Digana riots,? the Thera told the media outside the NCP today.
During a media briefing in Kandy yesterday, Anti Corruption Force director Namal Kumara had allegedly accused DIG in charge of TID Nalaka de Silva had tried to use him to frame Commandant, Senior DIG M. R. Latheef and also to use underworld figure Makadure Madush against some VIPs.
Mr. Kumara had said he was introduced to DIG Nalaka de Silva by the IGP Pujith Jayasundara a year ago.
He alleged that DIG de Silva was a corrupt police officer and was dreaming of becoming the IGP and Director of State Intelligence Service (SIS).

Do we need an all powerful president
	
It?s politicians like Rajapaksa who through their greed for abusing? power made the post of president look like something disastrous and? harmful to the country (Photo AFP)
?
If one turns the pages of time, the president who abused his portfolio the most was Mahinda Rajapaksa
	?
	This is a country which encounters opposition on the way to establishing any change, whether its for the good or the bad
	?
	This amendment was all about arming the president with absolute power
	?
	President Sirisena was able to put a stop to certain questionable decisions by the Government ministers because of the executive powers bestowed upon him
	?
	The question arrises what if there comes to power a politician who wishes to follow in the footsteps of former President Rajapaksa?
?
Nine years after the ?bloody? war and three years into the Yahapalana Government, Sri Lankans are still scratching their heads and looking for ways of putting this nation on a strong footing.?
The country?s citizens have tried both the leading parties-the United National Party and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party- and now seem to realise that even a Government comprising members of both these parties has not delivered in keeping with the expectations of the people.?
In this context the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) believes that the solution to all these ills the country is plagued with has been caused by the title of executive president. JVP?s parliamentary member Vjitha Herath was quoted in the Daily Mirror this week stating that the post of president has caused for much damage to the country. According to Herath, the JVP has proposed the 20th Amendment to the Constitution which, if passed, will restrict the role of the president.??
True. If one turns the pages of time, the president who abused his portfolio the most was Mahinda Rajapaksa who not only weakened the opposition, but also the judiciary and the media. He took the best advantage of being the executive president and initiated the passing of the 18th Amendment to the Constitution. This change allowed anybody to be the president of this country any number of times. This amendment was all about arming the president with absolute power. It?s politicians like Rajapaksa who through their greed for abusing power made the post of president look like something disastrous and harmful to the country.?
Just for the record, most of the past presidents of this country, including Rajapaksa, and even the incumbent head of state Maithripala Sirisena stressed the fact that they wished to abolish the presidency once they were voted into power. But these promises have never been kept and the presidents in power did realize as they served in this capacity that having so much power also made their task easier.?
President Sirisena was able to put a stop to certain questionable decisions by the Government ministers because of the executive powers bestowed upon him. The scrapping of the decision taken to allow women the opportunity to purchase liquor and annulling of the decision taken to increase the salaries of Government ministers by some 200% were done with the speed of snapping a finger, thanks to the powers vested upon the executive president.??
But still a large percentage of this country?s citizens believe that the powers vested upon the president is excessive. This nation might not have a president like Sirisena forever. The question arrises what if there comes to power a politician who wishes to follow in the footsteps of former President Rajapaksa? This is why people fear the powers that the executive president of this?country exercises.?
JVP?s Herath has said that he believes that present President Sirisena would extend his support for the enacting of the 20th Amendment
The JVP has now proposed the 20th Amendment to the Constitution and presented it to the Constitutional Assembly with the view of reducing the powers of the president.?According to JVP?s proposal, the 20th Amendment will restrict the president?s role to that of overseeing the Provincial Councils. Herath has said that the proposed amendment was to reduce the powers of the president, but not to abolish the post in its entirety.?
?
JVP?s Herath has said that he believes that present President Sirisena would extend his support for the enacting of the 20th Amendment
?
The JVP claims that it has had discussions with the UNP and members of the opposition regarding the proposed amendment. The party believes it can obtain enough support to enact this amendment in parliament.?
This is a country which encounters opposition on the way to establishing any change, whether its for the good or the bad. We have seen in the past how motorists reacted aggressively when new traffic laws were imposed to discipline drivers. This is how people, representing what?s bad, respond to change. There is always opposition to something good that?s to be introduced like a factory or a hotel in a village; projects which generate so much jobs and offer benefits.?
JVP?s Herath has said that he believes that present President Sirisena would extend his support for the enacting of the 20th Amendment. President Sirisena, after being sworn in as president, affirmed that Sri Lankans had got used to a slave mentality during the past regime and added that they should get used to the new freedom that he wished the country would embrace. But he warned that the slave mentality was one that is hard to break free from.?
The Yahapalana Government is in the process of drafting a new Constitution and presenting it to Parliament. But all signs point towards this process taking some time before the law makers get to see this draft. The only thing discussed by law makers about this new Constitution is how it defines the status given?
to Buddhism.?
Sri Lanka needs to prune the powers of the executive president and enhance the authority of the premier. There are cries from the opposition that such a move would lead to Federalism being established in the country. Pivithuru Hela Urumaya?s Udaya Gammanpila has already filed a petition in Supreme Court asking for a referendum if the 20th Amendment is to be passed.? ?
Given that Sri Lanka doesn?t see any future leader being groomed to take over as president of this country, it seems wise to get the proposed 20th Amendment to the Constitution passed in Parliament and see the face of politics in the island change for the better.

Immigration nabs 14 Thai women in Kollupitiya Spa
	
Fourteen Thai women, who were illegally employed at a well-known spa in Kollupitiya, Colombo 3, had been nabbed by the Immigration and Emigration Department flying squad yesterday.
The investigation unit, on a tip-off, raided the three-storied building on the Marine Drive in Kollupitiya and took 14 women, who were aged from 20 to 45 years.
A senior official at the Department told the Daily Mirror that most of the foreigners had arrived in the country recently and had illegally been employed at the spa, only with their 30-day visitor visa.
The local manager or the owner of the business had not been present at the time of the detection and Immigration officials had notified him to report to the head office to give a statement.
According to arrested women Rs.7, 000 upwards had been charged to their clients and the spa management had paid them up to Rs. 200, 000 as monthly salary.
The immigration department sources said the same place had been raided by Kollupitiya Police last month and a number of Thai women were taken into custody, but the place seemed to have resumed its operations shortly after.
Senior Assistant Controller M. G. V. Kariyawasam and Assistant Controller Prasanna Kumara and a team of Immigration and Emigration Investigation Division are conducting inquiries on the instructions of Immigration and Emigration Controller Border and Visa Chandana Hettiarachchi.
The arrested women are expected to be removed from the country today following the inquiries.(Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

listen, you could  save a life
	
With suicide among students being a crisis in Sri Lanka also, the World Health Organization (WHO) on Monday marked the World Suicide Prevention Day and various events were organized by the International Association for Suicide Prevention (IASP). According to Sri Lankan newspaper reports, many Sri Lankan female students are known to be committing suicide or thinking of doing so because of the sadistic ragging they are tortured with when entering universities. Tragically those involved in this crime are mainly second year students, who because of some psychological disorder, want to sexually harass the first year students. This year in some universities? first year students were reportedly forced to attend classes without wearing brassieres, the stress and tension are so severe that many parents say they prefer to even take a loan or mortgage property to send their daughters to foreign universities instead of allowing them to be sexually harassed in a crude manner.? ?
Higher Education Minister Wijedasa Rajapakshe recently ran into a controversy by telling incoming female students to box in the ear those who try to sexually harass them. He said that suspension from the university and jail terms were among the options available to the government to deal with the crisis of ragging, which is one of the main causes of suicide.? ?
With such sadistic ragging going on among university students, there is a grave concern over what sort of attitude the next generation would have when they take up highly placed jobs or even political positions. If new technology and modern standards are producing a sadistic generation, Sri Lanka needs to consider effective counter measures because it appears that many students are being influenced by sexual harassment and the worst form of pornography they have access to with a press of a button on their smart phones.? ?
According to the WHO, a person dies every 40 seconds by suicide and up to 25 times as many again make a suicide attempt. There are also many more people who have been bereaved by suicide or have been close to someone who has made an attempt.? ?
WHO says the projected global suicide rate for year 2020 is one in every 20 seconds. Suicide is now among the three leading causes of death among those aged 15-44 years. More males commit suicide while more females attempt.
While suicide is rapidly increasing around the world, delightfully in our small country, the suicide rate has greatly reduced from an alarmingly high of 47 per 100,000 population in 1995 to a rate of about 15, according to Sri Lanka Sumithrayo, one of the main movements involved in counseling to prevent suicides.? ?
Although this reduction gives reason to be pleased the rate is still high, and yet more disturbing is the number of attempts which is 10 to 20 times more and steadily on the rise. Death by suicide is more common in the rural areas where agricultural chemicals are readily available, despite great attempts made with respect to use of less toxic chemicals and safe storage.??
This brings our focus to the ever-present causes of suicide and the need to be aware, more attentive and concerned about those who may have suicidal feelings, Sumithrayo adds.??
Taking a minute to reach out to someone in your community ? a family member, friend, colleague or even a stranger ? could change the course of another?s life. Individuals who have survived a suicide attempt have much to teach us about how the words and actions of others can be important, and many of them are now working as advocates for suicide prevention and have informed resources which are now readily available, WHO says in giving the positive dimension of this crisis.? ?
According to the WHO people are often reluctant to intervene, for many reasons, including a fear of not knowing what to say. It is important to remember, there is no specific formula. Empathy, compassion, genuine concern, knowledge of resources and a desire to help are key to preventing a tragedy. Another factor that prevents individuals from intervening is the worry of making the situation worse. This hesitance is understandable as suicide is a difficult issue to address, accompanied by a myth that suggests talking about it may instigate vulnerable individuals to contemplate the idea or trigger the act. Evidence suggests that this is not the case. The offer of support and a listening ear are more likely to reduce distress, as opposed to exacerbating it, the?WHO says.? ?

MS squashes rumours, MR stirs elections debate
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in an interview with the Hindu has acknowledged that Gotabaya would definitely be a? contender at? the next elections
?
Another point that he stressed upon is the importance of the premiership after the enactment of the 19th Amendment
	?
	The 19th Amendment clipped the wings of the President drastically
	?
	The present President is more like a wing-clipped bird in that sense
	?
	The future Presidents, who would call the shots after 2020, will be devoid of such extra portfolios
?
President Maithripala Sirisena?s recent speech in Nivithigala gave people a glimpse of his political strategy which contains plans for 2019; theperiod ahead of the presidential polls. In his speech delivered last Saturday, he said he would not call for a snap presidential election. That way, he cleared the air of political rumours that the presidential elections would be conducted early next year. Now, the presidential elections will be conducted according to schedule; towards the end of 2019.? ?
In his speech, the President tried to assess the standing of the mainstream parties based on their performance at the February 10th local authorities? election. Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), which contested under ?Pohottuwa? (lotus bud) symbol emerged the single largest party at this election.? ?
Nevertheless, the President said that the ?Pohottuwa? would get only 102 parliamentary seats if it were a parliamentary election and it would not suffice to form a government single-handedly. Also, he said that the UNP, which trailed behind Pohottuwa, had overrated itself. All in all, he said 1.5 million votes polled by his United People?s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) as the third force would be the decisive factor at a national election.? ?
?Without our support, nobody can succeed,? he said.? ?
?
President tries to assume electoral significance?
The message he tried to drive home is obvious. His intention, by revitalizing his vote base, is to assume the role of kingmaker in politics at future elections. For any party to secure the presidency, it is sine qua non to obtain more than 51 percent of total votes polled at a presidential election. As such, the President is in the belief that his vote vase would only determine who could clinch the required percentage of votes at the next elections. So, he tries to gain electoral significance or to become a force to be reckoned with, by claiming to have bargaining power in the formation of a Government.? ?
Let alone the President?s opinion, the voting pattern at a local Government election will not remain the same at a national election. Therefore, it is impossible to use the performance of a political party at a local election as the yardstick to measure its possible strength at a national election. That is because people?s voting pattern differs from a local election to a national election.? ?
The UPFA headed by the President received 1.5 million votes. It will not remain the same at a national election. It can either improve or decrease.? ?
Another point that he stressed upon is the importance of the premiership after the enactment of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. He said the Prime Minister?s post would be all powerful in the future, and therefore one should talk about the eligibility of the Prime Minister rather than that of?the President.? ?
?
President is more like a wing-clipped bird
The 19th Amendment clipped the wings of the President drastically. Once appointed, he cannot remove the Prime Minister. Also, the Cabinet of Ministers has to be appointed in consultation with the Prime Minister only. Alongside, after the formation, the President cannot dissolve Parliament for four and half years. The present President is more like a wing-clipped bird in that sense. However, in the enactment of the 19th Amendment, there was certain relief or exemption granted to the current President- that is, he can hold ministerial posts in addition to the defence portfolio. Today, the President is also the minister in charge of the environment and Mahaweli Development as a result.? ?
The future Presidents, who would call the shots after 2020, will be devoid of such extra portfolios. So, their hands will further be tightened. Accordingly, it is well understandable as to why the President attached such significance to the post of?Prime Minister.? ?
After making such remarks in his speech, which received wide publicity in both print and electronic media, the President managed to reduce the limelight on the presidential election.? ?
?
MR says Gota a definite candidate?
Be that as it may, his erstwhile colleague, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, stirred the debate and raised it to a new level when he said in India that his brother would definitely be a contender. He made such remarks in an interview with the Hindu.? ?
When the President subdued the debate, Rajapaksa inflamed it further. Actually, there was a school of thought within the Joint Opposition that former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa should be nominated as the candidate now.? ?
MPs like Wimal Weerawansa held this view. They believe such nomination would constrict space for the Government to politically victimize Gotabaya Rajapaksa.? ?
?If there is a formal nomination, there will be more and more people gathered around him. Then, it will be difficult for the Government to do any harm to him politically,? he said.?

Neighbours in uproar over super luxury condo in Rajagiriya
	
Female residents living off Buthgamuwa Road, Welikada, Rajagiriya, are facing difficulties due to disturbing and indecent activities of Chinese, Indian and local workers working in a construction project of private apartments, named Iconic Galaxy on a land in their neighborhood.
The affected houses are located in between two construction sites; one belongs to the China Habour Engineering Company Private Limited and the Iconic Development.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, one of the residents, Dinali Perera, mother to three daughters, said the workers at the site cause severe difficulties especially for women.
?They walk on our road everyday smoking and without being properly attired. We don?t even go out of our houses after 6pm. Sometimes, when these workers see women they expose themselves and lift their sarongs. Besides that, they bring various women in three-wheelers at night. We find used condoms right outside our houses in the morning. They even pass sexual remarks at our daughters while on the road,? Dinali explained the ordeal.
This Buthgamuwa Road, which has 14 residences, does not connect to any other road and ends at a canal. Actual access to the construction land on the other side of a canal is from Kamatawatta Road, but the constructors have created a new access by building a bridge across the canal, Col. Retd.Vikum Siriwardana, one of the residents, told the Daily Mirror.
Residents alleged that the Sri Jayawardanepura Kotte MC had aided Indian property developer Iconic Developments Pvt Ltd by fraudulently issuing a certificate to the effect that Buthgamuwa Road is a road belonging to the municipality.
?Our numerous written complaints to Welikada Police, UDA, SLLRDC and the Sri Jayawardanepura-Kotte Municipal Council haven?t been acknowledged nor action being taken.?We do not know whether the Government of Sri Lanka has given this area over to Indians as it appears that Laws of the state are no longer applicable in this area? Siriwardana further said. (Piyumi Fonseka)

New Act to regulate foreign employment
	
The Government was mulling introducing a new Act to regulate foreign employment and to curb human trafficking, which was a major issue in Sri Lanka, Minister of Foreign Employment Minister Harin Fernando said yesterday.
Minister Fernando told a media briefing that decision on the issue would be made on recommendations by a Cabinet Subcommittee appointed to look into it.
?Human trafficking is becoming a serious issue as many underage women are sent for employment overseas by agencies through forged or fraudulent documents,? he said.
?We have found out about a thirteen-year-old girl who had been sent to Oman using fraudulent documents. She had faced many problems in Oman. This girl had tried to commit suicide inside the Sri Lankan Embassy premises in Oman. There are a number of similar cases,? the Minister said.
He said an alternative Act would be introduced instead of making the family background report compulsory.
The Minister said the Government would also have to take into account the requests made by international human rights organizations that Sri Lanka should not suppress the rights of a person to obtain employment, despite the duty of looking after the children.
?Fathers too should be involved in looking after the children other than the mothers,? he noted.
The Minister said future plans would focus on sending skilled and semi-skilled persons for foreign employment rather than sending women as housemaids.
?Sri Lanka should follow other countries such as India, which had stopped sending women to work as housemaids abroad,? he said. (Yohan Perera)

Not even President knows how pricing formula worked: JO
	
The Joint Opposition yesterday urged the Government to introduce a formula to increase the salaries of public and private sector employees as they did fuel price revisions every month.
Joint Opposition MP Dullas Alahapperuma told a news conference that the Government should also introduce a Samurdhi formula and a Transportation Formula to resolve the issues faced by the people due to the continuous fuel price increases.
He said all the rates and prices of other essential services in the country were rising because of the fuel price hike.
He added that nobody, including President Maithripala Sirisena, had an exact idea how this formula worked out and implemented.
?The attempts to obtain the details and procedures of this formula under the Right to Information (RTI) Act by several parties have failed. What is this cryptic formula? Even former finance minister MP Ravi Karunanayake has raised concerns over it,? he said.
He said Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera had introduced the formula following the conditions laid down by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF), risking the Sri Lankan economy. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Notes for a Manifesto: State, Religion and Rationalization
	
?
Nagananda Kodituwakku, a public interest litigator, has drafted a constitution for Sri Lanka. It would be the Third Republican Constitution since Independence if it moves from the draft, through discussion, and amendment (if necessary) to ultimate replacement of the Second Republican Constitution and its amendments.
He has detailed sweeping changes in judicial, executive and legislative powers, treaty obligation, size of parliament and cabinet, parliamentary privileges, election system, the right of recall as well as transitional provisions. We need to salute this indefatigable fighter for citizens? rights, true representation and accountability for the efforts expended in drafting this document. It deserves perusal and discussion.?
?
The British reneged on the agreement inked in the form of the Kandyan Convention with respect to the status?of Buddhism
	?
	What needs to be understood here is that recalling history is a dangerous game and if such ?correction? is the norm constitutions would have to be constantly amended as per changing demographic realities
?
Now a republic can be defined as a state in which supreme power is held by the people and their elected representatives and which has a leader who is elected rather than a monarch. Given diversities of all kinds, a leadership of a republic should ideally be representative of that diversity or at least sensitive to it.? Typically it?s the majority sway that finds expression in the governments that are elected. The majority can take many forms and where identity has sway there should be checks and balances to ensure that this ?edge? does not slide to a tyranny where those who don?t make up the majority are not reduced to lesser citizens in any way.?
Also, it must be understood that citizens are not entities without culture, philosophy and identity. Representation, therefore, gets inscribed by all this. This is why majorities mark the state one way or the other.? Such things can be legislated out of course, but then we need to have a different definition of ?republic?.??
That said, let?s get to the secular-wish of Kodituwakku?s proposal. He has been bold and clear and this is good. Also, let us not rush to think that he is proposing just a word-change. Constitutions give direction. Key elements such as secularism would obviously require amendment and/or repeal of any articles in order to keep intact the integrity of the notion. Governments obtain from these and proceed to amend policies to affirm the constitution.??
This is what the summary which he has made public recently says:
?[There will be] strict? anti-racial [and anti-]discrimination laws with severe? penal? sanctions against any form of discrimination, guaranteeing human dignity, self-esteem and respect would? be? guaranteed to every citizen.? He adds: ?Every citizen is identified as a Sri? Lankan only and any reference made to race or religion in any instrument will be cancelled forthwith and no Sri Lankan shall be compelled to declare his/her race or religion.???
There?s a rider that might cause some problems, though: ?Every citizen will be required? to? ? respect the culture, religion, rights and freedom of other social groups and to further national interest and the national unity.?
The problem is this: religions and therefore religious practices, depending on the religion and the practice, of course, can by definition infringe on other religious communities and their rights. In other words religions can spill outside the particular religious body; for example, those religions which consider proselytization an article of faith or whose religious texts define religious others as infidels who need to be eliminated by any means necessary. Where do we draw the line and who decides a) if lines should be drawn and b) what these lines are? The questions raised will be hard, but they need to be raised and addressed.
It might help to consider certain scenarios that exist and/or are recommended. There are some, for example, who claim that injustices should be remedied. The British reneged on the agreement inked in the form of the Kandyan Convention with respect to the status of Buddhism. A correction would mean that we need to reaffirm the particular article. Some might say this was done via Article 9, i.e. Buddhism being conferred the foremost place and the State required to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana. However, it can be argued that this ?special status? is immediately and effectively negated by Articles 10 and 14(1)(e). What needs to be understood here is that recalling history is a dangerous game and if such ?correction? is the norm constitutions would have to be constantly amended as per changing demographic realities. If, for example, there?s some kind of mass slaughter of a particular religious community (and we have seen this happen), someone might say, ?now go ahead and legislate for the changed reality!? An extreme example is given here to illustrate the point: Buddhists can ethnically cleanse the island of Hindus, Christians and Muslims, or Muslims can eliminate those of other religious faiths. What then of true republicanism? What then of the secular wish??
We can defer such things to such a tragic eventuality of course. What we cannot defer is the non-secular interventions of the state in a would-be secular state.??
Here are some of the questions that secularists would have to address:
In a secular state enacted through constitutional reform on the lines proposed by Kodituwakku and others, can there be more than one system of law, i.e. special laws for particular religious communities? If there?s going to be one law for everyone (as proposed), what then of ?customary law?? Will Thesavalamai Law, Kandyan Marriage Law, aspects of Sharia Law embedded in the Constitution be repealed???
What is required then is a system of rationalization. A Christian friend mentioned one irrationality (and this is not about secularization): ?Ours is a religion that sanctions wine in the church itself, but liquor shops are closed for Christmas which is a day of celebration and not Easter, a day for abstinence, penitence and general reflection.???
There need not be bo leaves on the national flag because that would be ?Buddhist?. The Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act will have to be repealed. All legislation, as well as other written and unwritten ?understandings? for religious exceptions for Muslims during Ramadan and in the event of widowhood, divorce and childbirth, would have to be removed.?
Note also that provisions enabling Christian and Catholic priests to function as marriage registrars would have to be abolished. If the state requires to recognize such unions priests shouldn?t be allowed any part in the matter.?
That would not mean of course that religious practices are outlawed, but just that no one can make any claim on the state for special privileges.?
If you want to keep all that because ?that?s how it has always been? then we immediately make room for historical claims and with it we cannot leave out the articles in the Kandyan Convention.
The issue is this: are we really serious about secularism? Will secularists respond? Whether they do or do not, the following must comment Nagananda Kodituwakku, Rohan Pallewatte, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, Patali Champika Ranawaka, Ranil Wickremesinghe, Maithripala Sirisena and any other individual entertaining hopes of becoming the next President of Sri Lanka.?

Nuisance next door
	
In the recent past, lands in and around the Colombo area are being inundated with luxurious residences, that promise the city?s finest lifestyle. Such apartments are mushrooming all over Colombo District as a response to the strong demand for rented out apartments. If the creating of the lives that some people always wished to enjoy, forces another set of people to suffer, then it is unfair.
The residents and land owners, living off Buthgamuwa Road, Welikada, Rajagiriya, are raising voices of dissent against a property developer, an Indian company by the name of Iconic Developments (Pvt) Ltd, which has commenced a construction project of private apartments, named Iconic Galaxy, on a land in their neighborhood.
This luxurious 33-storey tower comes after the developer?s previous? ?110 Parliament Street?-a project with over 170 residents in Rajagiriya- which opened in 2008. Iconic Galaxy will have 272 super-luxury apartments in a land spreading two acres.

The residents in Buthgamuwa Road claim that the construction site has posed severe threats to their safety and welfare and demand to know whether this is the ?price? they have to pay? when this type of development takes place in the area.
?We do not know whether the Government of Sri Lanka has given this area over to Indians as it appears that Laws of the state are no longer applicable in this area and the Government authorities, namely the UDA, Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (SLLRDC), Sri Jayawardenapura-Kotte Municipal Council (MC) and the Police are all acting to facilitate the requirements of this Indian company violating the laws of Sri Lanka. Inaction by the Police hierarchy with regard to our complaint further cements this,? Col.Retd. Vikum Siriwardana, one of the residents, told the .

Flood threat
This Buthgamuwa Road, which has 14 residences, does not connect to any other road and ends at a canal. Recently Iconic Development Ltd commenced the project of constructing private apartments on a land to which there is access from Kamatawatta Road, Rajagiriya and borders the said canal on the opposite side. The constructors later constructed a bridge across the canal so as to obtain access to the construction site from our private road, residents claimed.
Actual access to this particular land on the other side of the canal is from Kamatawatta Road, but with the construction of this bridge another access has been created from Buthgamuwa Road.?
?This road comes to a dead end. The road borders a canal and part of the land, consisting of two blocks between the canal and the road, was earmarked as a flood water retention area in the UDA master plan, hence filling was prohibited all these years. However, these lands, including the canal reservation, are being filled by the owners since of late. As a result these two blocks are now at a higher elevation from the road and the rest of the premises. Even when these lands were left as water retention areas, our road and the premises were submerged by flood water on a number of occasions. There was severe flooding in 1992 and 2010 which cut off completely whatever access our residences had with Buthgamuwa Road. There was minor flooding on several occasions including last year when our private road was submerged by water,? Siriwardana said.
They fear that with the filling of these two blocks, which are now at a higher elevation compared to the road, their road and residences will be submerged by water in the event there is a minor shower.?
?
?
?
Regular movement of vehicles
Channa de Silva, an engineer by profession, is also one of the residents who is facing difficulties due to the construction site.
According to him, the regular arrival of men and vehicles to this particular construction site, using their road, has plagued them with issues related to health and security, apart from restricting movement.
?Given the huge presence of this project, consisting of 272? apartments that are spread across 33 storeys, - we foresee thousands of vehicles plying these roads (in future). It is difficult for two cars to pass through the road coming from opposite directions, let alone find a space to park,? de Silva said.
He said the presence of new high-rise apartment complex in the area would only worsen the haphazard parking and congestion.
?
He stated that their numerous written complaints to Welikada Police, UDA, SLLRDC and the Sri Jayawardanepura-Kotte Municipal Council haven?t been acknowledged nor action being taken.?
?The constructors use heavy machinery late into night disturbing the residents, particularly children who are preparing for various examinations and our complaints to Welikada Police haven?t brought us any relief,? he said.?
The excessive noise from the construction site has doubled because there is another construction site which belongs to China Habour Engineering Company Private Limited. The affected houses are located in between the two construction sites.
?Due to the continual harassment we had to endure, we as the residents put up notices in the form of signboards indicating this to be a private road. Iconic Development lodged a complaint at the Welikada Police against the residents for putting up boards. The Welikada Police, who totally ignored the complaints we lodged earlier, was quick to initiate an inquiry into the complaint by Iconic Development and summoned us to the Police Station,? he said.
?
?
We are not against development, but it should not be at the expense of destroying the lives and properties of long standing residents of the area

Private road turning into a public road
At the police inquiry, the representative of Iconic Development produced a Government Gazette issued in 2009 where Sri Jayawardanepura-Kotte MC has proclaimed part of this private road as a road vested with the said MC.?
The particular representative has also submitted a letter from UDA giving authority to Iconic Development to construct a bridge across the canal. However, according to the residents, Sri Jayawardanepura-Kotte MC at no stage had informed the residents of any such decision, nor obtained written concurrence from the residents nor pay any compensation for acquiring a private road belonging to the residents. Therefore, the residents claim that the decision to vest the private road with the Sri Jayawardanepura-Kotte MC is a unilateral decision of the said MC. They consider this decision to be illegal although a Gazette notification has been issued by the said MC to the effect.
The residents, who had no idea until their private road was announced as a public road, requested more details regarding the Buthgamuwa Road from the Kotte MC through a RTI application last year.
Information Officer of the Kotte MC replied to the residents? RTI last year stating that the private road off Buthgamuwa Road was not declared as a public road according to the records maintained by the Municipal Council. He had also said that such a decision was neither taken and nor gazzetted. Please see the letter on topright.
?
Leaving more questions on the said Government Gazette which was produced by the Iconic Development representative at the police inquiry, where Kotte MC has proclaimed part of this private road as a road vested with the said MC, the residents are in possession of a recent valid street line certificate issued by the Kotte MC in 2016 stating that this is a private road, which was submitted to the police as proof.
Hiran Perera?s house is also located on Buthgamuwa Road. He along with the other residents alleged that the Sri Jayawardanepura Kotte MC had aided this company by fraudulently issuing a certificate to the effect that Buthgamuwa Road is a road belonging to the? municipality.?
?With the help of this fraudulent certificate this company has obtained the necessary approvals from UDA and SLLRDC for this project creating severe hardships to residents of this narrow road. UDA and SLLRDC have failed to verify accurate facts and blindly granted approvals to use our private road as an access road to this large apartment complex. Our complaints to UDA Chairman, Chairman of SLLRDC and Municipal Commissioner of Sri Jayawardanepura Kotte MC have not prompted any action or at least a proper inquiry into our complaints,? Hiran said.
?We are not against development, but it should not be at the expense of destroying the lives and properties of long standing residents of the area. Development should conform to laws and regulations,? he added.
Adding to what Hiran said, Nipuna Leelawansa, another resident, alleged that it is apparent that all the Government Agencies involved, namely UDA, SLLRDC, Sri Jayawardanepura Kotte MC and the Welikada Police are turning a blind eye to the illegal acts of Iconic Development (Pvt) Ltd for reasons best known to them and have even connived with this company by giving approvals illegally.?
?We have also read recent newspaper reports that similar situations have arisen in the Pitakotte area due to the relevant authorities issuing development permits disregarding regulations for personal benefits from developers,? he said.
?
Chinese, Indian construction?workers causing nuisance and sexual harassment
Apart from traffic issues and land issues, the residents have been facing more difficulties. Explaining them, Dinali Perera, mother to three daughters, said the workers at the site cause severe difficulties especially for women.
?They walk on our road everyday smoking and without being properly attired. Lives of women, living on this road, are not safe anymore. We don?t even go out of our houses after 6pm. Sometimes, when these workers see women they expose themselves and lift their sarongs. It is very uncomfortable for us to even step out of our own houses. Besides that, they bring various women in three-wheelers at night. We find used condoms right outside our houses in the morning. All our children are very young. Almost all of us have daughters. They even pass sexual remarks at our daughters while on the road. When they are drunk, they torment our pets also,? Dinali explained the ordeal.?
Large numbers of workers of various nationalities including Chinese and Indian are accommodated in a former warehouse building right next to their houses.?
The Daily Mirror witnessed that the premises where workers are accommodated does not contain even basic facilities to accommodate such a large number of workers and doesn?t have even good sanitary facilities.?
?
?
We don?t even go out of our houses after 6pm. Sometimes, when these workers see women they expose themselves and lift their sarongs. It is very uncomfortable?for us

?
The residents have witnessed on many occasions workers accommodated at this premises doing their ablutions on Buthgamuwa Road, an act which they consider poses a serious health risk to the residents.?
?There are more than two hundred workers employed at these two construction sites: Iconic Galaxy and the China Habour construction site. But there are only two toilets for them. Most often, our road is used as a toilet by these workers. We cannot walk on the sides of the walk because of the odour. Some of the workers have their meals seated on our road and discard food waste, empty drink cans, food wrapping material etc on the road polluting our environment and increasing the risk of diseases,? Dinali explained. ?Perhaps due to lack of space, most of the workers spend their time after work seated on the road consuming alcohol and creating disturbances. The construction site releases effluent into the canal. The canal is now in an extremely polluted state and has become a serious health hazard to residents,? she further said.
The residents also wrote to the Chief Medical Officer of Health of Sri Jayawardanepura-Kotte MC on 13 July. But, no response has been received to? the letter from the MoH yet.
?
Buthgamuwa road ends at this canal. The developer constructed a bridge across the canal to obtain new access to the construction site
?
The construction site releases effluent into the canal also. Canal now is in an extremely polluted state, residents claim
?
The residents reiterated that they were not against development, but were against the blatant disregard for rules and construction guidelines.
?We want to get the regulations enforced. At least, let us live in peace in our homes? a spokesperson for the residents said.
?As we all know, the Government Agencies mentioned above have been appointed to safeguard the interests of citizens of Sri Lanka and ensure upholding the laws of land. But, if the same agencies are instead looking after the interests of a foreign company blatantly disregarding laws and regulations of Sri Lanka, including environmental regulations, resulting in serious repercussions to citizens of Sri Lanka, it is high time that the highest authorities of the Government open their eyes and do the right thing,? the spokesperson for the residents added.
?
?No truth in this allegation?
Iconic Developments of India Managing Director Rohan Parikh responding to Daily Mirror in writing from India had this to say. ?It is important to note here that the so-called ?residents? are a small group that has been harassing and blackmailing us since the inception of the project, solely with the intention of extracting money .On several occasions in the past they demanded money from us to allow us to continue with our construction work. This was in spite of us having the necessary permissions in place. There is not even an iota of truth in this allegation.?
?Incidents like this make it difficult for foreign investors like us, giving an impression that the risks are high. It makes it seem as if anyone can make a baseless allegation without due diligence. The damage to the reputation of the country can be irreparable if well-meaning investors with integrity and a long-term vision for Sri Lanka are treated in this manner.

?Our project has been thoroughly vetted by several of the top law firms in Sri Lanka and its execution is based on permissions issued under the laws of the country. With regards to the road in question, it was declared a public road over a decade ago long before we, the developers, were even in the picture. In any event as an extra precaution we have also purchased a Right -of -Way over the road, thus ensuring that the legality of the project is not impacted under any circumstances.?
It is even more pertinent to note that every agency of the Government of Sri Lanka, which has signed on this project, has done so in compliance with all rules and regulations. As for the bridge adjourning the land, the landowner obtained a bridge construction approval from SLLR & DC in 2012. We have just repaired the old bridge with all approvals from Sri Jayawardanapura Kotte MC in 2016.

?
?
We have left 60% of the land open for flooding of the canal in compliance with the rules of the SLLRDC. Thus in case of the canal water level rising there will be no adverse impact on the area surrounding our building. We have also committed to beautify, clean and plant trees along our side of the canal to ensure we maintain ecological balance,? Parikh said.?

Prez perturbed over CDS arrest move
	
President Maithripala Sirisena who hurriedly summoned a special Cabinet meeting today criticized the move to arrest high profile military officers even without initiating court action against them.
The President summoned this meeting in the event of moves by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to record a statement from Chief of Defence Staff Ravindra Wijegunaratne over the incident in which 11 students were abducted during the war time. He was asked to give a statement to the CID last Monday. However, he had gone to Mexico the same day. Also the CID had informed court earlier that they would arrest the CDS. .
The President is reported to have said that it is unbecoming of those concerned to harass the officers of the military top brass in this manner even before initiating court action. Also, the President took swipe at Minister Sarath Fonseka for criticizing Army Commander Mahesh Senanayake and speaking about defence matters. (Kelum Bandara)

Raising money for a worthy cause
	
?
Kids can be amazing.? Born with a natural empathy and kindness, especially toward animals, children can connect with them on a special level that adults may not be able to fully understand.? Introducing 10 year old American boy, Connor Jayne.? After learning that his beloved emotional support dog, a Doberman named Copper was sick, decided to raise the money himself to pay for his dog?s expensive medical treatment.? Connor himself has various medical issues - he struggles with PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder), anxiety and a chronic headache disorder.? Originally Copper was bought as a pet, but soon became a pivotal part of Connor?s life.??
Emotional support animals are becoming increasingly popular for people not only dealing with mental health issues but also for a variety of disabilities.? While dogs are the most popular companion, it?s not unusual to find people with cats, ducks and even miniature ponies as their support animals. While there are criticisms in regards to the validity of keeping these animals, it?s believed that they are intuitive enough to be able to sense when their human companion is becoming stressed or overwhelmed.??
It?s because of this that Copper is able to sense when Connor is about to have an anxiety attack and will lay on him like a weighted blanket (which is known as DPT ? deep pressure touch) which is helpful in reducing his stress levels.? Although Copper was never trained to do this, when the Jayne family got Copper it was something he did instinctively.? It was also Copper who alerted Connor?s mother Jennifer that something was seriously wrong in the nights with Connor.? He would stand at Connor?s bedroom door barking until Jennifer opened the door and was able to see first hand that her son was having nocturnal seizures. When it happened again she was able to film it to take to the specialist and Connor is now on medication that controls his seizures thanks to Copper.? It was because of this act that Copper received his service dog qualification.
Mental health conditions are on the rise in all parts of the world and Jennifer shared some tips for parents that may be struggling with a child who is showing signs.? ?I think the biggest thing for parents to do is to be empathetic and understand it?s not their fault and they?re child isn?t doing it on purpose. The children need help figuring out strategies to calm themselves and some parents just get angry and think they?re acting up or refusing to do something. It?s the hardest thing to watch and not be able to help.? Having our dog makes it easier and because of their connection I know he can help my son through.?
It was then very sad news in 2017 when Copper developed a limp and needed to have extensive testing including an MRI scan.? Faced with a looming vet bill Connor decided to give back to the dog he owed so much to and decided to raise the money himself.? What followed was a lemonade/snack stand, as well as Connor cleaning out his toy room and selling his toys in a garage sale (his mother eventually snuck a few back into the house otherwise Connor would have sold everything!).? Even with Connor?s contribution they didn?t have enough money for expensive vet bills ? it was then that Jennifer started a Go Fund Me campaign to raise the money and a good thing she did as they?ve already raised almost USD18,000 to go towards Copper?s treatment for what was preliminary diagnosed as Intervertebral Disk Disease (which causes back pain, rear limb paralysis, and inability to walk or feel the back legs) as well as tendionapthy (forelimb lameness), both of while have been ruled out now. Further testing is needed and the family are keeping a close eye on Copper to make sure he?s not too active while they are still trying to diagnose what is causing the problem.? Connor has been overjoyed at people?s kindness to help his hero, Copper and we pray for his speedy recovery.

RIGHT OF REPLY ?Political Circus Hits Town?
	
Your columnist, Ilica Malkanthi Karunaratne, in her column? titled ?Political Circus Hits Town?, published on 11 September 2018, has chosen to make certain derogatory references to me. I am sorry that Ilica, whom I have known for several years, has done so. She states in her column:??
?We also have Nihal of CJC fame jumping in like a Bull in a China Shop to give his professorial bill (sic) a hand, in stating that there was no impediment in the pseudo-Emperor contesting the Presidency again. The latter has unfortunately not changed his clothes, literally or metaphorically, and Nihal may find that visions of CJC become more than a blast from the past in the minds of the people. Political leaders must act like Statesmen with dignity and fortitude through all seasons, ? ?meet with both triumph and disaster and treat those two imposters just the same.? (The highlights appear in the text as published).??
I do not think the last sentence applies to me since I am not a ?political leader?; nor have I ever been a politician. I do not understand what the reference to me being ?of CJC fame? means. Assuming that ?CJC? refers to the two Criminal Justice Commissions that functioned in the early 1970s, I was not a Judge or Prosecutor in either Commission. I was not accused before the CJC that tried persons responsible for the JVP April 1971 Insurgency. I was not accused before the CJC that tried persons accused of exchange control offences. I did not draft the CJC Bill. In fact, it was drafted by the Legal Draftsman on the instructions of the then Attorney General, the late Victor Tennekoon QC.? ?
Ilica clams that I ?jumped in like a Bull in a China Shop to give his professorial bill (sic) a hand?. She refers to an article written by me that was recently published in two newspapers. She apparently does not know that a trained lawyer and a qualified academic does not act in that manner. She also appears to be unaware that in two previous articles I had already noted what I believed were certain unintended consequences of the 19th Amendment. Having regard to the circumstances in which the 19th Amendment was enacted, with an entire chapter being deleted and replaced in Court, and numerous amendments being proposed from both sides of the aisle and being accepted by an exasperated Minister of Justice as the clock moved menacingly towards midnight, it is no surprise that a clear copy of the Bill as amended was not available for certification by the Speaker for an inordinately long period of time.??
In my recent article I examined the implications of Parliament abolishing the existing office of President and replacing it with a new office of President with considerably diminished powers. I did not write that article at anyone?s request, as Ilica alleges I did. I did not share my manuscript with anyone before I sent it to two editors, as Ilica suggests I may have done. The views I expressed in it were mine, and mine alone.The fact that I argue that there is a defect in a law does not mean that I advocate that others should take advantage of that defect, as Ilica appears to believe I intended. I have a strong belief in the democratic norm that no elected Head of State should serve more than two terms. I also believe that this country was best served, for nearly three decades, by a constitutional Head of State. Therefore, the remedy for this constitutional conundrum surely lies in the enactment of the 20th Amendment as proposed by the JVP.?

Rohingya refugees Crisis : The Tale of Cox?s Bazaar home to the world?s largest refugee camp
	
?
Following the Ethnic conflict in the Rakhine state in Myanmar,Rohingya refugees have found Cox?s Bazaar in Bangaladesh a safe haven. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the refugee camps around Cox?s Bazaar homes the world?s largest refugee camp.The influx is said to be the world?s fastest growing refugee crisis?with the UN describing the situation in Rakhine, as a ?textbook example of ethnic cleansing.
? Various health issues have inevitably cropped?up in Cox?s Bazaar owing to the conditions in the camps and the heavy monsoon. Against this backdrop Dr. Padmini Perera from the World Health Organization (WHO) Country?Office in Sri Lanka assisted in providing the technical expertise required for providing health services. 
She has worked in the area of emergency preparedness since 2010, initially at the Ministry of Health, Sri Lanka and now at?the WHO Country Office.? ?In an interview with the Daily Mirror, Dr.Perera shared her experience?of working in Cox?s Bazaar?during a recent three week visit there. She gave an insight?into the health issues prevalent?and how the WHO contributed?in maximizing the health services provided. She said that the?refugee influx in Cox?s Bazaar?was a Grade 3 emergency?that required a massive?response.? ? ?
Excerpts of the interview:
?
?Q? To start off- what were your initial observations of the situation in Cox?s Bazaar??
I had to lead the health operation team in the Cox?s Bazaar field office. We had around 11 people working in the health operations team and we worked along with the Epidemiology, Admin and logistics teams in the WHO field office. WHO has an Operations Plan for the response and my task was to streamline the work in line with the Operations Plan.? ?
This was all a continuation of the services that have been provided by the WHO since the start of the influx in 2017. This time the conditions were far more settled than last time when I went there in December last year. Last time when I was there, there was an outbreak of diphtheria.??
The WHO has a way of classifying the emergencies as ungraded, Grade 1, Grade 2 and Grade 3. This is a Grade 3 emergency where a massive response is required. It?s not easy to provide health services to 1 million refugees. There are many barriers including language barriers. They speak a different language which is neither Bengali nor the language spoken in Cox?s Bazaar.?
I was anticipating most of the problems. It?s the same kind of things that crop up at any emergency. The context is different, but it?s the same issues that come out.?
?
Sri Lanka has a very strong healthcare delivery network. The public health network is very much in place to make sure that any person in the country can be reached
?
?Q??What were the main health issues that arose??
One main issue was the spread of communicable diseases. Then there were issues related to water, sanitation and hygiene. There were quite a few camps and they were cramped up. There were a lot of partners working in the field trying to improve the situation.? ?
?
?Q??There was limited funding and the circumstances were obviously dire. How challenging was it to treat refugees??
WHO is the cluster lead for health emergencies globally. We provide the technical lead. We support the development of plans, protocols, and provide guidance to partners. We are also involved in monitoring and the evaluation of health services in the field along with the other health partners. WHO doesn?t directly provide patient care in the field. There are almost 100 other health partners like MSF, UNICEF, UNFPA, Brac which is a local NGO, the Red Cross, the Red Crescent etc.? ?
?
?Q??Did you interact with the refugees while working there??
My task was to provide technical guidance to the health operations team coordinating with the other technical teams and also other health partners. I was not directly involved in interactions with the refugees.? ?
?
?Q??The press release issued by the WHO states that cholera was prevented this time and that measles and diphtheria were curtailed. How was the WHO instrumental in this??
It was through the immunization campaigns. We had around three rounds of vaccination for cholera. It was the same with diphtheria. We had several rounds of diphtheria vaccination. So we were able to curtail the diphtheria outbreak. There were no reported cases of cholera. But due to the camp conditions there, the cholera vaccine was given. The WHO planned the immunization programme together with the other health partners and the Ministry of Health of Bangaladesh.
?
?Q??In terms of emergency preparedness how do you think the Sri Lankan health sector can improve taking into account the experiences of working in Bangladesh??
Sri Lanka has a very strong healthcare delivery network. The public health network is very much in place to make sure that any person in the country can be reached. Even in disasters and emergencies we use the same network. Having such a resilient and strong system has been a plus point. We also have a well-trained health staff. In addition we have the national disaster management framework and all stakeholders support each other for any emergency.? ?
?
?Q??How did your experiences of working in emergency situations in Sri Lanka assist you during your time in Cox?s Bazaar??
It was easier for me to understand the challenges in the field and also what the needs would be. That helped a lot.? ?
?
?Q??Apart from dealing with disease outbreaks, how has the WHO been able to deal with the psychological state of the Rohingya refugees??
It was through the mental health and psycho-social support programme. In Bangladesh it is led by Action Against Hunger (ACF), which is an international NGO which is the lead for mental health and psycho-social support. WHO provides the technical leadership to the partners in Cox?s Bazaar.
?
?Q??Seventy percent of births are taking place outside health facilities. What measures has the WHO taken to encourage people to access sexual and reproductive health in Cox?s Bazaar?
UNFPA leads the sexual and reproductive health technical programme. All partners in that particular group as well as the health sector has been working towards improving people?s understanding of the services available. You have over 200 health posts. Not all have labour facilities, but still, there is a good network. What we want to promote is for people to access these places, and not just stay at home (camps). We encourage people mainly through awareness by urging them to come to maternity?clinics etc.? ?
?
I had to lead the health operation team in the Cox?s Bazaar field office. We had around 11 people working in the health operations team and we worked along with the Epidemiology, Admin and logistics teams
?
?Q??Are there adequate sanitary facilities??
You have adequate numbers. You have adequate sources of water. But the problem is the quality. WHO is working with the partners on water quality assessment in the field.??
?
?Q??Do refugee children have access to education??
Now they have schools. There is an education cluster which is working in the field providing education to the children.? ?
?
?Q??What?s the specialty of the early warning alert and response system that?s established there??
WHO has established the Early Warning and Response System (EWARS) in the camp settling. You get alerts from the health posts on communicable diseases.?
If there is a communicable disease that is reported with a potential for an outbreak, the WHO along with other partners immediately sends a team to investigate and assure that measures are taken to prevent further spread.?
For example, if it?s a watery diarrhea case, we don?t know whether it?s just watery diarrhea or cholera. So you go to the field immediately and investigate, and do some active case finding- to see if there are more cases. Then we take remedial measures and make sure it doesn?t spread beyond that particular point.? ?
?
?Q??Do you have any memorable experiences from your time there which you would like to share??
The thing which struck me most was visiting the Cox?s Bazaar laboratory. The last time I was there we were working towards establishing a field laboratory.?
The second time I went there it was functioning and it is so close to the camps. It contributes much to the health service delivery in the field, especially in the area of communicable diseases. It was really a pleasant experience visiting the functioning lab which we were working towards several months back.? ?
?
?Q??Any constraints you faced??
Any emergency context has so many challenges and this is a situation involving refugees and not a situation with internally displaced individuals. There are many social and political issues involved.?
This added that extra layer of complexity to providing health services in the field which was quite a challenge.?The partners are doing a good job considering the difficult conditions and WHO is providing technical assistance to ensure that the best possible healthcare is given in the field.?

Sajith, others have to wait for 11 more years: Susil
	
The second generation of UNP leaders, including it?s Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa will have to wait for another 11 years to get hold of the reigns of the party from its current Leader Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, MP Susil Premajayantha said today.
Speaking at a news conference of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), he commented on PM Wickremesinghe?s speech made at the UNP?s 72nd Convention held recently.
?The Premier said the next generation of party leaders are being groomed to take over the party by 2030. This means Sajith, Akila, Navin and others will have to wait 11 more years. Even at 2030, there is no assurance as to who will get the party leadership. There were many demands within the UNP asking for a leadership change. The people who asked for a change are silent now,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Saving Sri Lanka, One Plant at a Time
     	 
  At the Daily Mirror, we believe that climate change is one of the greatest threats that we, as Sri Lankans, will face in the future.  Therefore, we intend to provide our readers with local and international content with the objective to educate and inspire. We would also like to learn from our valued readers about any ongoing initiatives in making Sri Lanka a more sustainable nation.   
 We aim to explore sustainable ways of living that have the most positive impact on not just our natural environment, but also for humans and animals.  
While topics such as global warming, pollution, and inequality are confronting, we believe it's time the media stopped shying away from these issues and became an active participant in finding solutions - and we hope you will join us. 
     
				 		 
	
	
Global deforestation rates hit a record high in 2017 as data revealed that the world has lost one football ground?s worth of forest cover every second in 2017. Not only does this mark an upward trend in deforestation but also jeopardises all efforts to tackle environmental issues including climate change.??
A small but important group of Sri Lankans are attempting to change this trend. Reforest Sri Lanka, a non profit society committed to protect and extend the forest cover in Sri Lanka was formed by a group of students studying for their MBA at the University of Moratuwa in 2015. What started out as a mandatory course work, shared among eight students, eventually became their passion project, planting saplings where necessary and raising awareness on the importance of reforestation.?
?
Over the course of 28 months they have replanted over 50,000 saplings with the participation of 3,500 volunteers
Founder and President of Reforest Sri Lanka Achala Meddegama hails from Peradeniya. He recalls seeing the Hantana mountain range engulfed in flames during the dry seasons, sometimes even a dozen times a month. ?As swathes of forest cover were destroyed in wildfires I felt that we had to initiate change to preserve the natural beauty of this country,? said Achala.?
Their initial project was to plant 500 saplings. ?What we observed during this project was that Sri Lankans are keen on efforts to protect and preserve the environment, but that doesn?t necessarily translate into action. Public engagement on this kind of work was almost non existent,? he said. Encouraged by the response they received, the group decided to take their exemplary work across Sri Lanka.?
Their initial areas of concern were to increase the forest cover, especially in government lands. Reforest Sri Lanka has been instrumental in replanting saplings in catchment areas with native and endemic trees. Their usual choices would be to replant trees such as Karanda, Kohomba, Nelli, Aralu and Bulu. They would also add 10% of fruit trees to this mix for animals and birds to feed on.?
The organisation functions entirely on the services of volunteers, while various corporates, university staff, students, factory employees as well as members of the Army and Navy have taken part in the reforestation efforts led by this group.?
A re-planting project carried out with volunteers
Reforestation is not an easy task. It involves finding the saplings as well as an immense amount of groundwork.? ?Over the course of 28 months we have replanted over 50,000 saplings with the participation of 3,500 volunteers,? he added. Their efforts have taken them across the length and breadth of Sri Lanka in search of viable areas for re-plantation. They have successfully completed re-plantation projects in?
Ingiriya, Kalutara, Kandana, Talawila, Knuckles, Batalanda, Wellawaya and even planted 15,000 saplings along the Galle Expressway from Kadawatha onwards.?
If you wish to support this worthy cause, reach out to them via reforestsl@gmail.com or through the Reforest Sri Lanka facebook page where they share updates of their projects as well as useful information about our environment.?

Suppression of Buddhists in N-E: Govt. not keen to curb situation: Nalaka Thera
	
The government is not taking action over the recent protests carried out by a group of Tamil politicians and some Muslim extremists in the North against a move to build an archeological office at the Kurundankulama Asokaramaya in Mullaitivu, National Rights Organization President Ven. Bengamuwe Nalaka Thera alleged today.
Addressing a news briefing, he said Kurundankulama Asokaramaya was an ancient Buddhist temple with archeological value.
?This was just one incident which demonstrates the moves by some Tamil and Muslim groups which are trying to suppress the Sinhala Buddhists in the Northern and Eastern provinces. What is pathetic is that the Government has turned a blind eye to these incidents,? Nalaka Thera said.
?Some incidents related to the attacks of the Sinhalese in the North and East, are not exposed to the people. Nevertheless, the Sinhala residents of the Nayaru and Kokilai areas are facing suppression from the Tamil politicians and Muslim extremists,? Nalaka Thera said.
?This has become a huge threat to the Sinhalese Buddhist people in the North and East,? Nalaka Thera added.
He said the Government?s continuous silence in this regard would be a challenge to the country?s reconciliation process.
?The office for National Unity & Reconciliation which is under the chairmanship of former President Chandrika Kumaratunga, is doing little to promote reconciliation,? Nalaka Thero said.
Meanwhile, National Rights Organization Legal advisor Attorney Nuwan Ballantudawa alleged that Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran was gradually attempting to expel the Sinhala community from the North.
?This is a clear example to show as to how the Tamil politicians attempt to get rid of Sinhalese people. The Northern Province Chief Minister has no authority to do so according to the law. If he does so, it is a violation of fundamental human rights,? Ballantudawa said.
?If the Government keeps on allowing these types of extremist politicians to utter words like this, it would be a threat to the Buddhist culture of this country,? he added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Time and space depicted through art
	
?
Co45 which is a budding art gallery and workspace in the heart of Colombo held an art exhibition, featuring artist Ikuko Deguchi,who is a Japanese Ink & Ceramic Art Specialist, from August 17-26. The paintings at the exhibition depicted the theme of ?time and space?. Ikuko is a resident of Sri Lanka living in Negombo, she has lived in Sri Lanka for 13 years. She has been exhibiting art in Sri Lanka for the last 10 years. The objective of CO45 is to create a platform for International artists and to create a community of international family-oriented art education platform along with nonprofit projects of supporting the women and children in Sri Lanka.??
Emiko Hanano the owner and founder of Co45, in an interview with the Daily Mirror said,?This particular exhibition was a Japanese artist solo exhibition. This is the second exhibition of the CO showcase. We launched on April 7 and we invited the Japanese Ambassador and other excellencies and guests to participate. the Ambassador himself spoke about the significance of cultural exchange through art.We are not focusing on the sales of the painting. Therefore, our exhibitions are not a commercial gathering, but rather a cultural exchange hub. We want to create a platform for both the local and international creators, to exchange culture and their perspective through art.???
She also spoke about her vision for CO45, ?I want it to be a long-term art hub, something that is sustainable for all artists. I do not want it to be something one off, like a firework. I want this project to take roots, and bloom and grow into the future. I want it to be a sustainable platform that artists can rely on.There are many Japanese art students interested in this project. Hence, we are trying to make a programme for them as well in the near future. We are planning to do some animation and digital workshops as well???
She spoke about her message to the art community and the importance of art in our lives,?I want people who have the passion for art to know that art is not just about selling art. I want people to know Sri Lanka has the potential to be a predominate platform for art tourism and art exchange. We need professionals and amateur lovers to join to achieve this dream.I believe art truly connects people. Many people used to ask me why are you drawing? Is it to become famous? But I truly wanted to give a message through my art. Visual messages are very strong and does not need language to convey them.???
Ikuko Deguchi, the solo artist of the exhibition gave an insight to the thought process behind her paintings, ?I wanted to try to understand the universe through my paintings. My technique is that I use canvas, paper and silk as painting material and I used various Japanese inks, minerals, pigments, paper and powder gold, colour pencils and pencils as drawing tools. I live in Negombo next to the lagoon, and the water truly inspires my work. I admire the nature and beauty of this country, it is my true muse.?? Speaking on the theme she said, ?the theme ?time and space? is nothing new but I decided to out my own spin on it. Paintings are 2D, but I use different techniques such as different inks and pigments and the use of light for my paintings to appear 3D.???
?
The objective of CO45 is to create a platform for International artists and to create a community of international family-oriented art education platform along with nonprofit projects of supporting the women and children in?Sri Lanka
?
She spoke about her message through her art and her journey as an artist,?I began my journey as an artist at the age of 6 years. When I was 17 I went to the Tama university of art, Tokyo, for sculpture. I lived around the world and was inspired by different styles of the world. I combine my experiences throughout my life and I present it in my art. In our technology dense world, I believe art is important.Art is something that comes from your soul. It is there to connect with people. Our world is getting more and more disconnected. I believe something truly touching such as art, will build that connection again. Art is very personal information, that can be shared visually. It is hard to understand art, sometimes there is no explanation. But, I believe it brings some kind of feeling whether the viewer understands the art or not.???
Her final message was, ?I want people to be free through art. Where there are no barriers of cast, creed, language or race. It is important for people to be flexible in their art, where they learn from many countries. It is important to be respect your traditional art roots, but the nature of art itself will be contradicted if one does not free themselves through art.?? ??

War casualties may not have exceeded 8,000: MR
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapksa, who is in New Delhi, has said that the number of war casualties in Sri Lanka including the terrorist casualties may not have exceeded 8,000, the Hindu reported.
Delivering a public speech on Wednesday, Mr. Rajapaksa said extravagant numbers reaching up to 40,000 have been recklessly bandied about as the alleged scale of fatal casualties.
?This is false and malicious propaganda...the number of casualties, including terrorist casualties, would probably not have exceeded, 8,000,? he said in response to the international campaign for justice for the persons affected by the war.
He said that the Sri Lankan military saved 300,000 Tamil civilians who were trapped in the last stage of the war from a narrow strip of land in the east.
He reiterated that the war of 2009 was against terrorism of LTTE and not against the community.
Mr. Rajapaksa hit out at his international critics and said that allegations of human rights abuse against the victorious Sri Lankan military is ?false?.
?We did not at any time, wage an ethnic war: the military action was certainly not directed against the Tamil community. It must not be forgotten that the reach of this terrorist organisation was not confined to Sri Lanka, but extended to Indian soil where they assassinated Shri Rajiv Gandhi and many others,? Mr. Rajapaksa said at the speech organised by Virat Hindustan Sangam led by BJP MP Dr. Subramanian Swamy.
The public speech, the first ever delivered by any Sri Lankan political figure in recent years dealt in detail with the war that began after the peace negotiation between the Sri Lankan government led by Mr. Rajapaksa, and the LTTE broke down in 2006.
?Eradication of terrorism was not for the sole benefit of one community, or even for one country,? said Mr. Rajapaksa arguing that not completing the military campaign that led to the killing of LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran, would have amounted to ?betrayal of coming generations.?
Earlier, introducing the speaker, Dr. Swamy said: ?Mr Rajapaksa is the frontrunner for the next government and hopefully he will be President of Sri Lanka soon. He took decisive action against terrorism and cleaned up the country. As a result Sri Lanka is today a favoured destination of international investment.?

WPC?s cosy costly chairs cancelled by Governor
	
Western Province Governor Hemakumara Nanayakkara said he had ordered Western Provincial Council Chief Secretary to cancel the purchase of 144 chairs, each costing Rs. 644,000, with immediate effect.
Addressing a press briefing in Rajagiriya, the Governor revealed that Rs. 644,000 for a chair was without the import duty and when included the tax, the price of a chair would be approximately Rs. 844,000. ?
He said according to the investigation the original plan was to import 150 chairs and it has dropped down to 144 chairs.
?I asked from officials as to why they were going to order more chairs as WPC required only 104. They said there could be an increase of number of Provincial Councillors in the future. But according to my information the councillors would be reduced to 102 in the next election,? he said.
He said the new chairs were needed for the council, but purchase of chairs had to be either made in Sri Lanka or assembled in Sri Lanka at an acceptable price.
He said he would take relevant action in future if he got any reasonable complaint regarding abuse of power or misappropriation of funds in the Western Provincial Council.(Darshana Sanjeewa)
