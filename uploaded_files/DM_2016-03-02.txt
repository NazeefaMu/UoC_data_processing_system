A story about a frequent visitor to neglected circuit bungalows
	

The second in command in yahapalanaya recently paid an official visit to the South to take stock of the ongoing development activity in the province.

During the visit, purohitas and Diyawanna members from the South who accorded him a warm welcome updated him on the development activity underway from Matara to Kataragama.
During this conference, a purohita from the Hambantota district brought to the attention of the visiting bigwig that the circuit bungalows available in dozens in the district have fallen into a state of neglect and disuse.
Sir, there are several circuit bungalows in the Kataragama area itself, the purohita said. These bungalows located on extensive tracks of land are crumbling for want of proper maintenance. If the bungalows are not wanted, at least the valuable lands where they are located should be put to some productive use. Its a crime to allow this state of affairs to continue any longer
The second in command who was attentively listening to the purohita opened up with a tale-tell smile lighting up his face, Amathituma, why do you say that these circuit bungalows serve no purpose There are parties who make the best use of these bungalows though you dont appear to know it. I think its a sin to close these bungalows 
The second in commands reply caused titters among the participants.
They also in whispers shared their information about a certain prominent purohita who had made it a habit to frequent these bungalows invariably with some fair one or the other in tow.

An unseen hand in awarding of the contract
	

The awarding of the contract for building houses for the war-displaced in the North to an Indian company for an amount described as unreasonably high has come under fire from many quarters.

 The purohita in charge of the subject has got into an untenable position with even the TNA ruling the roost in the North taking up cudgels against him over the affair.
Although the purohita in charge is facing the music, the person who is really behind bringing the foreign construction firm into the scene here is said to be a much more powerful political authority, they say.
The powerful political authority himself is a big name in the business world. However, government had to appoint a committee to look into this deal when it came under fire from one quarter after the other.

Big foreign investor asked to go
	

There is a big foreign company functioning in our country for the last 30 years. This company is engaged in producing an essential food item for our people.

A state regulatory body committed to creating a vibrant business environment recently raised sky high certain tariffs levied on this big company. Despite being one with global status, the company found it difficult to bear the increased tariff burden and its head called on the chairman of the state regulatory body to apprise him of the difficult situation that they were placed in. The reaction the company head got at this meeting was something entirely unexpected. We are not prepared to reduce our rates. If you cant operate here, you may make your exit! the chairman had snapped at him.
A shocked and dismayed company head had later explained his unpleasant encounter to the companys decision-making body. Government invites foreign investments. But these people ask us to go. Given this situation, we have to shift our operations to another country where the climate is more favourable, he had said.

The Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka has requested subscribers to check with their service providers and disconnect if there were any connections operating under their name without stipulated documents or explicit consent.
It is necessary for the subscribers to inquire whether a mobile phone connection had been obtained by providing a copy of their NIC or any other relevant document without their consent and disconnect such connections through a relevant telephone service provider, the TRC said.
It informed all mobile phone subscribers to inquire and ascertain that service providers had all relevant documents of the subscriber, which required when applying for a mobile telephone connection.

Drinking coconut water has given him a young look
	

A leading light of the joint opposition, a vocal critic of yahapalanaya to boot, has kicked his long standing smoking habit.

When their group met last week, a colleague had teased him saying that he looked years younger with his face taking a new sheen of late.
The politico had said in response giving up smoking was the secret of his young-look
However, dandy prince Panchayudha had immediately contradicted him saying: You have become more handsome as a result of drinking lots of coconut water at the many coconut breaking rituals held in the recent past.
Meanwhile, a senior Diyawanna member chipped in with the suggestion that their colleague who had become younger and handsomer by drinking coconut water, could surely do more marvels with coconuts. Let us make him the Coconut Industries Minister when we form our government, he added.
I was looking forward to getting some portfolio with some relevance to economic development. But you people are trying to foist coconuts on me. What a bad luck has this coconut breaking brought to me! The member who kicked the smoking habit lamented.

Eight monks disrobing daily: Speaker
	
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said that Buddhist Monks disrobing had become a challenge and that eight monks disrobe each day, thereby affecting the functioning of many temples throughout the country including those in Colombo and the suburbs.
The Speaker was explaining the present malady facing the Buddha Sasana at a Damma Discussion held recently at the Kandegoda Maha Cheithiya Pirivena Temple in Balapitiya coinciding with an event to hand over credentials to the Senior Professor of the Department of Philosophy at the Human Science Faculty of the Kelaniya University, Ven Kandegoda Wimaladhamma Anunayaka Thera, for the Anunayaka position of the Ambagahapitiya sect of the Amarapura Chapter.
The ceremony was held under the patronage of the Chairman of the Amarapura Maha Sanga Sabha, Rajakeeya Panditha Ven. Dodampahala Chadrasiri Nayaka Thera.
The Speaker also said he was sad to note a news item that had appeared in some foreign media outlets about recent events that took place in the country that had brought disgrace to the Sasana. The Nikaya Kathikawatha (convention) was introduced by the government to confer judicial power to the Sanga Sabha on the advice of the Maha Nayaka Theras.
He said even after 90 years the Kathikawatha could not be amended. However, he said this Bill would not be introduced in Parliament.
The world has today recognized the importance of Buddhism as a religion and Sri Lanka has the responsibility of spreading the knowledge of the Dhamma to the world. Buddhism has received state recognition in Austria and US President Barack Obama takes a Buddha Statue with him wherever he goes and engages in meditation. This shows that the important role Buddhism plays in the world, the Speaker said. (S.A.U. De Silva)

His plan backfires
	

A certain media institution with close links to the government made elaborate preparations to hold Sinhala/Tamil New Year celebrations on the home turf of the new Big Boss.

The high-ups of the institution were a little hesitant initially for that as the proposed celebrations could cost the institution a tidy amount. However, the livewire behind the proposed event waved off their reservations saying that even the Big Boss was already in the know of it and in fact, the idea had come from him.
While preparations for the celebrations were underway, a bigwig of the media institution received a call from the nerve centre of yahapalanaya.
A powerful
white-collar one from the highest place inquired as to who had taken the initiative to hold the New Year celebrations even without their knowledge. Why on earth are you being extravagant with institutional funds like this he queried.
The high-up of the media institution was too stunned to give a ready answer.
In the meantime, the white collar bigwig continued: Stop the preparations for the celebrations forthwith. Even if you hold the function, the Big Boss will not attend it It looks like there is someone at your place trying to have his way by name dropping. You have to protect yourself from such shysters.
The organizer of the aborted New Year celebrations at this media institution met his Waterloo soon afterwards, they say.

Lakshman Kiriella berates journalist
	
Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella, who is now embroiled in a controversy over the appointment of a lecturer to Kelaniya University on temporary basis, had been very abusive to a journalist of the Ada newspaper when he asked him about the matter.
Mr. Kitiella had asked the journalist whether he was aware of the University Act and, if he was unaware of the powers of the minister, how he could question him about his authority.
The minister had taken a swipe at the journalist saying, "I have the authority, and I used it after perusing the appointee's qualifications. First read the University Act before jumping to conclusions. We are not using these powers. That is our fault. The former government used them. (He used unprintable language on the journalist) When Mahinda was in power all of you just looked up and waited. Just because you carry a pen in your .......(Again he used unprintable language), you do not deserve to be called journalists. First go and read the University act (Again he used unprintable language). (Amith Maduranga)

Law point clinches her stand
	

This member of the joint opposition, a very vocal one, had been of late quite upset over a court case, because an unfavourable outcome could cost her the precious Diyawanna seat.

The member, an avowed loyalist of the former strongman, taking no chances given her present plight, was inching towards yahapalanaya as a safety measure. However, she was under pressure from her staunch supporters in her constituency that she should continue to back the former strongman regardless.
Being placed on the horns of a dilemma, the member decided to consult a legal eagle to have the last word on her case. The legal eagle who delved deep into the law at length came up with an irrefutable law point that could open up for her an easy way out of her current predicament.
Dont worry any more about this case. Ask your attorney to cite this law point and that will settle the case in your favour for good, the legal expert had assured her. On being relieved of the worry that plagued her for months, the member overwhelmed by a surge of gratitude went down on her knees and worshipped the law expert, they say. 
Now that she is no longer in need of safety measures, the member is said to be all out to play a lead role in the political campaign led by the former strongman.

China is a big economic power in the region and countries should look at China as an opportunity rather than a threat, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, who is in India to take part in the Raisina Dialogue, said on Tuesday.

China is a big economic power in the region, along with India, she said addressing the inauguration of the three-day dialogue, a global conclave on geopolitics and geo-economics organised by the Indian External Affairs Ministry and the Observer Research Foundation.
She also said that the conflict between India and Pakistan had hindered the development of the region badly.
Ms. Kumaratunga went on to state that South Asia had immense potential to increase trade and bring in development though it was the least integrated region in the world.
She also stressed the need for building trust and confidence among the countries to increase cooperation. 
A paradigm shift is needed in the policies of the governments. The new generations, having born after the India-Pakistan partition have left behind conflict and are looking forward for development of the region, she said.
She said there was also a need for pragmatic action plan by the leaderships of the countries of the region to economically integrate and develop.
There is no need for a grand vision, but only a pragmatic action plan, she said.
Meanwhile, she called for the enterprise of building cooperation and economic integration between the countries in South Asia first and then with other countries in Asia.
Sri Lanka, having good relations with all countries, can act as a bridge between nations, Ms. Kumaratunga said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

NDB Bank CEO Rajendra Theagarajah, Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake and GVR Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd Chairman/CEO Mahasen Samaravijaya



NDB Bank joined hands with GVR Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd to promote Dynasty Residence, the luxury apartment project in Kandy, among its premier customers in the Central Province.
GVR Lanka and NDB Bank recently hosted an exclusive event for key NDB customers at the Earls Regent, Kandy, which saw the participation of many distinguished personalities. The Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, senior staff members along with regional and branch managers of NDB Bank were present to gracethis occasion.
During the event, NDB Bank announced special housing loan financing packages with very attractive terms formulated to offer its premier customers the opportunity to invest in Dynasty Residence.
Dynasty Residence is an exclusive development on the banks of the Mahaweli River in the hill capital, offering panoramic views and situated just minutes away from the proposed Colombo-Kandy highway. The 19-floor superstructure is now complete and the NDB customers had the opportunity of viewing the majestic show apartment during the event.
The eminent project team and developers of the project have ensured that the project meets the highest environmental standards and is poised to obtain the US Green Building LEEDS rating GoldCertification. The unique design is taken into consideration framing the views of Hantana, Hunnasgiriya knuckles range and the Mahaweli River.
It also takes the intelligent use of space into account in order to offer a Sri Lankan and Kandyan living experience. The level of attention to detail has been extraordinary and the building is therefore a natural fit for those with eclectic tastes and stringent expectations of the highest quality. This is also the first luxury apartment project to construct a cross ventilation of continuous clean inflow of unobstructed fresh air that permeates through the internal spaces at all times.
While the standard apartments in Colombo provide very congested rooms and amenities, this unique apartment complex has been designed with varied options so customers could select apartments, which better suits their needs.
It comprises of 17 different model options such as eight types of three bedroom designs, four penthouses exclusively designed with a personal Sky Garden, golf putting course and a tailor-made entertainment facility along with five unique Sky Villas designed with double the height for living, dining and balcony facilities along with a view of the river and the magnificent knuckles range that can be enjoyed at all parts of the interior.
With about 42 percent of the space being built for common amenities which inhabit the first five levels, the apartment complex promotes sustainable luxury community living with ample community spaces to interact with other occupants. It has many amenities including a doctors examination room, larger parking spaces and ramps along with a 170 meter-long roof top jogging track with viewing decks.
NDBs premium customers, who were welcomed by GVR Lanka Founder and Chairman Mahasen Samaravijaya, were enthralled by the multiple exciting aspects offered by the apartment complex, including its view, elegant design and luxurious features. He stated that one of his intensions was to have something luxurious, spacious and affordable to offer expatriates, who have been used to such living standards and attract Sri Lankans who have left the country back to the place they once called home.
Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake, who graced the event, described Dynasty Residence as a much-needed development for Kandy and was pleased with the quality and class that Dynasty Residence brings to the real estate sector of the city. Retired Senior Deputy Inspector General Nimal Mediwake upon viewing the furnished three-bedroom model apartment and taking a full tour at the site likened Dynasty Residence to living in a paradise and was excited to behold such an elegant construction right beside the Mahaweli River.
The bouquets included Honorary Consul for France in Kandy and Sinhaputhra Finance PLC Managing Director Ravana Wijeyeratne expressing his belief that the project promised to deliver a product on par or above most apartments in Colombo. He lauded GVR Lanka for taking on an ambitious project which offers those who wish to make Kandy their home, a living space that reflects Kandys future promise. He stressed it was only a matter of time before the modern infrastructure of the proposed highway and faster trains, will make Kandy the headquarters of choice for many companies that wish to have a practical outreach to all provinces.
He drew the attention of the crowd to what really dictates cost, which is the quality of the building material and the quality of the architects, engineers and contractors and not the land value, which is thinly distributed. He emphasized that the value of the cost today can only be cheaper than tomorrow. NDB Bank Chief Executive Officer Rajendra Theagarajah speaking at the event said, NDB is truly delighted to be part of this project in Kandy. We have always strived to give the word development a new meaning and our aim is to provide total banking solutions that strengthen ones capacity to do better, which in turn makes your community do better; if this aggregation is fulfilled, the whole country will subsequently prosper. Dynasty Residence fits well into our definition of development, as it encompasses a vision to offer superior living accommodation in Kandy. It has therefore proven to be worthy of our support and association.

NDB Wealths simple formula for financial independence
	

With another Sri Lankan Independence Day already passed, isnt it time you did some thinking about how well youre doing in achieving your own financial independence, asks Prabodha Samarasekera, CEO of expert financial plannerNDB Wealth.
Samarasekera also said, Financial freedom means different things to different people; not having any debt, having enough saved for emergencies or being able to retire early. Another way to look at it is to have your assets generate income that is greater than your expenses.
Samarasekera advised, Heres the big catch: Your career is your most powerful tool for financial independence. That often means more work in the short run, but that additional work simply serves to shave years off of your goal of retiring early. Youve got to keep your eyes on the prize and that means sometimes doing things in an innovative and non-traditional way, while also working very hard. If you do, youll find financial independence creeping closer and closer.
There are two ways to achieve financial independence; increase your assets and reduce your expenses. While a simple lifestyle will help you manage your expenses, accumulating assets require careful planning and knowledge, suggested Samarasekera.
As such, Samarasekera recommended freeing your money from traditional bank deposits and allowing your heard-earned savings to reach their full potential, with the help of NDB Wealth, an exemplary financial advisor that has been recognized by Global Banking & Finance Review magazine as the Best Asset Management Company, Sri Lanka 2015.
As an ideal place to begin the fight for your financial freedom, NDB Wealths simple and easy-to-use Money Plus money market fund, which offers a 7.25 percent current yield, is an excellent first choice. The NDB Wealth Money Plus account not only offers higher rates of return, compared to savings and deposit accounts but also affords the flexibility of depositing and withdrawing cash at any time, with no penalties, while the income earned is also tax free, to your hands. And once youve got on track with your plan to achieve your financial freedom, the qualified and experienced advisors at NDB Wealth can also offer guidance on other financial products and solutions for your future. So, its time to go beyond the limitations of financial independence and achievetrue freedom.

There is no camp of Sarana Gunawardene in Attanagalle now. Murderers, ransom seekers and rogues and those who were engaged in illegal activities have no place now in the SLFP, said former president, the chief SLFP organiser for Attanagalla Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumarathunga at a seminar held at Sangabodhi college Nittambuwa.
She said there weren't two factions in the SLFP. "There is no SLFP of Mahinda Rajapaksa. Only the SLFP under Maithripala Sirisena exists now," she said.
"The rule against the people ended on January 8, 2015. There was a time when two ministers could not speak to each other. The ministers lived in constant fear. Now it is not there. People are now able to breathe freely and there are no white vans. We should not forget that we ended the terror regime of Rajapaksa and good governance was established by all the forces that rallied round to usher in a country that would safeguard the future. Despite certain shortcomings, the state institutions, police, courts and other establishments are functioning according to the requirements of the people," she said. (Warana Ananda and E.

President Maithripala Sirisena had led by example how the Ministers should use Government funds with diligence, Finance State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said yesterday pointing out the Presidents recent visit to Singapore.
When he visited Health Minister Rajitha Senarathne, the President did not allow any Minister to accompany him using Government funds. All Ministers used their own money even to take their fares, he said.
He said the President had made this as an example.
No delegation would be allowed to tour foreign countries. As members of the SLFP, we should appreciate the Presidents example, he said.
President Maithripala Sirisena completed twelve official foreign visits since February 15, 2015 to date after the Government came into office.
The President had made his first three-day overseas visit to India on February 15, 2015 on the Invitation of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
In his visits he tried to rebuild the countrys broken relationships with other countries.
We should highlight how the President tried to take out the country, which had been shut out from other countries, he said.
The members of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) know their limits, while being in conventional Government. Our policy is toeing the Government line, while strengthening the Government sector, he said.(Chaturanga Pradeep)

However, he said the university authorities had to adhere to the propper recruitment criteria despite such recommendations from politicians.
I do not know why there is a hue and cry about this letter. As university administrators, we constantly experience this. After job interviews, interviewees turn to politicians for favours. Then, these politicians issue recommendation letters. It has happened right throughout. There are also telephone calls.

Thajudeens murder/BCIT, Canada may help with CCTV footage
	
The CID informed Court that there was a possibility of receiving direct assistance from the British Columbia Institute of Technology of Canada for clarification of the CCTV footage concerning the murder of ruggerite Wasim Thajudeen.
The CID had earlier made a request through Interpol for foreign assistance to improve the clarity of the CCTV footage that possibly contained evidence related to the crime.
Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Pieris had ruled that the death of Thajudeen appeared to be a murder under section 296 of the Penal Code and ordered the director of the CID to take appropriate action immediately to apprehend the persons responsible for the act.
However, on an earlier occasion, Senior State Counsel Dilan Ratnayake, representing the Attorney Generals Department, had said that getting foreign help to clarify the CCTV footage might take some time on account of unavoidable technical issues -- as they had to go through the Foreign Affairs Ministry and Interpol.
The case was put off for March 23. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

There is a big one they are afraid to attack
	

Several joint opposition heavyweights were having a confab in the House lobby the other day.

They were bragging about how they tore the government high ups to smithereens at a recent media briefing. Meanwhile, a few government members who passed by also stopped for a while to hear what they were saying.
The joint opposition ones kept on gloating over their political exploits with much relish. One of them proudly announced that that they were ready to expose some spicy stories about the Reds as well.
At this stage a talkative yahapalanaya member who was quietly listening  butted in: You boast that you are not afraid to attack any big guy in the government. But arent you mortally afraid to take on 
Only that twosome from the minor parties with you have the guts at least to mention his name!
The joint opposition ones greeted this challenge with sardonic smiles. The government member continued: Even your big mouth from the South who often talks big at your media briefings has never uttered one word against him. You always target only one person. If you people are such great heroes, I challenge you to attack this big one.
Then the quorum bell was heard ringing and they all made their way towards the chamber.

They are considering a stop-gap leader for new political party
	

The much publicized move to found a brand new political party has taken a back seat with no national election in sight.

There is another reason for the prime movers to put the plan on the back burner: Former strongman has yet to say yes to the offer of the party leadership. Meanwhile, the leaders of the minor parties in the joint opposition have proposed to launch the new party without further delay with the Boralugoda scion as the stop-gap leader until the former strongman makes his appearance on the scene come an election. However, the proposal is said to be still under consideration and it is a cinch that the Boralugoda worthy will not accept the leadership even for the time- being without the nod from the former strongman, they say.

Wimal questions Kiriellas behaviour
	
Condemning the manner in which the Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella addressed a journalist of Ada Newspaper during a telephone conversation, the Joint Opposition today called all media rights organisations to come forward and raise their voice against the Ministers remarks.
The Ministers unethical vocabulary he used to scold the Ada journalist Amit Maduranga, was heavily criticised by people, after an audio clip of the conversation went viral on the Internet and social media.
The Minister had scolded Maduranga, when he inquired the Minister regarding a letter reportedly sent by the Minister, over an appointment of a temporary University lecturer.
Speaking at a media conference, MP Wimal Weerawansa asked whether this was how the Yahapalana Governments Higher Education Minister responds to a journalist.
He is justifying him that in his capacity as the subject Minister, there is a provision in the Act to make recommendation and there was nothing wrong in doing so, Wimal said.
Where are those so-called media rights organisations Where is the Free Media Movement Why is the Editors Guild remaining silent However, we could clearly witness the way the Government bared their real self in this short period of time, he said.(Piyumi Fonseka)
