A maniac on the loose!
	
?
This officer whose job is to look after the health of the public has become a nuisance to young female minor employees working under his supervision, they say.
?
He has reportedly turned his official bungalow located opposite a fire station into a rest for the female employees and has got the watcher of the bungalow to intimidate the females who reject his amorous advances.
The nefarious activity of this sex-maniac, who counts big names of a main political party among his close pals, is due to be exposed at a sitting of a local body shortly, they say.

## Title: A nation of readers and writers Are we there yet?

A nation of readers and writers Are we there yet?
	
?
The Big Bad Wolf book fair, held for the first time in Malaysia in 2009, has spread over the years to several other parts of South East Asia. In 2017, Sri Lanka became the first country outside the region to host it. The response, based on conversations I?ve had with those who attended it, was overwhelmingly positive. People of all shades and persuasions patronised it. Books were brought by the dozen, sometimes two or three dozen (this writer can attest to how difficult it was to keep oneself from overspending on them), and more than one visit was made by the same person. Promotions in the form of preview passes and membership discounts, moreover, were eagerly seized. All in all, then, it was a different kind of fair, a different experience altogether.? ?
And yet, they weren?t just those promotions or discounts. They were the choices that were on offer. There were genres that catered to every possible market, from fiction and non-fiction to children?s fiction and young adult fiction (the difference between which has all but completely been blurred in mainstream book stores here today). For obvious reasons there were stalls which attracted big crowds and stalls which hardly attracted any crowd, but the message even with this was clear: people don?t just look for prices (not that they don?t, particularly considering the plight of the rupee against the dollar and the rising cost of living), they also look for variety. At the end of the day, when it comes to being a nation of readers, and writers, that is what they privilege. And value. Sometimes even more than the cost.? ?
There were howls against the BBW, I distinctly remember. The source of that anger and despair was patently clear. The BBW was seen as a threat to local publishers and they were protesting the fact that it sold books which were priced sometimes at 10% of their prices. That it was unveiled around the time of the Colombo Book Fair may have worsened matters. In any case, when the BBW returned this year, it was held two or three months back, long before the month of literacy (September), and it had to do with other similarly titled fairs organised locally which sold books at around the same discounts the BBW did.? ?
All that leads me to the subject of this piece; if we are to become a nation of readers, a point I highlighted in my column in September of last year, what is it, based on book fairs and bookstalls, that we should privilege, or at least try to privilege?? ?
?
Scrounging up money?
To become a nation of readers and writers, it is not enough that we have fairs which sell books for half the local price. It is not enough that we attend these fairs no matter how wide the choice offered to the consumer may be. Books, like all other industries, have been turned into a profit-run enterprise. The retail market is no stranger to cost-cutting and profit maximisation. The primary objective, as always, is to scrounge up as much money as is permissible from as many readers as is possible.? ?
There are two ways of getting around the muddle this has resulted in, here or for that matter elsewhere. The first is to be selective in what one reads. This is what the elders usually say. The second, which is the method I prefer, is to read everything one comes across. Before we get to what the best way may be, it is pertinent to understand how the publishing industry operates, the trends it panders to, and the culture of self-censorship it has embraced over the years.? ?
?
To become a nation of readers and writers, it is not enough that we have fairs which sell books for half the local price. It is not enough that we attend these fairs no matter how wide the choice offered?
?
Publishers are as swayed by ideological persuasions as politicians and this is reflected in what they choose to publish. In that sense, certain genres always sell. In Sri Lanka, these include not just young adult fiction (which anyway, from the time of Karunasena Jayalath, has been a quite a big seller), but also history (smudged by not a few self-serving myths), science fiction (think of Susitha Ruwan?s Rawana Meheyuma cycle of novels), translations (of the Russian classics), detective thrillers (of which there are so many examples), and of course horror (Deeman Ananda).? ?
For obvious reasons, one cannot expect mainstream publishers to go beyond these safe choices and because of that, every year, we see the same titles, the same themes, the same subtexts, being reworked and promoted over and over again. To become a nation of readers, therefore, it would seem that the second of the two choices I?ve highlighted above (to read everything in one?s way) is the more rational to follow.? ?
Underlying this is a more serious issue, however. Publishers, like newspaper editors, are wont at certain times to censor themselves or refract myths as truths in a bid to sell more books. I am of course talking about mainstream publishers here, since there was and always will be an underground market of publishers and self-publishers, who give breathing space (in a manner of speaking) to writers who would otherwise never have been able to explore the (controversial) topics they indulge in. What gets missed out and absented here, sadly, is a literature that can be considered as ?radical?.? ?
Radicalism has always been a stimulus for literature and this is true of Sri Lankan literature as well. Just think of the response the author of Budunge Rasthiyaduwa received. This, a title as hyped as Fukuyama?s End of History (which David Brooks once aptly described had little to do with the ?end of history? thesis most readers subsequently read into), did not really pique my interest, and yet, it represented a different way of thinking which I welcomed, as a reader and a critic.? ?
?
Mainstream publishing
To be sure, Budunge Rasthiyaduwa was not Bawatharanaya just as Bawatharanaya was not the book it was influenced by (Kazantzakis?s The Last Temptation of Christ), but consider that it was published by an outlet (Sanhinda, founded by Upul Shantha Sannasgala) that, though mainstream, has nakedly displayed its preferences to writers and poets who have nowhere else to turn to with their radical, at times controversial, views. My point being, incidentally, that inasmuch as it was hyped and not worthy of the controversy it received (at one level it reminds me of Handagama?s Aksharaya, which incidentally was produced by Sannasgala), it was needed.? ?
This is precisely the point that those who either lambast or praise the Big Bad Wolf miss out: that inasmuch as it was and is a radical outfit selling all sorts of books, the true worth of an enterprise of that scale can only be measured by how much it does not cave into the culture of self-censorship even the most out-of-the-box book fairs and publishers have led themselves to. It is choice that we should be looking at, yes, but when it comes to reading and writing, what should ?choice? actually entail?? ?
I know of children who have read Bonda Meedum but have not, for some reason, even once encountered Madol Doowa and Amba Yahaluwo. Consider that these are 17 and 18 years olds (at that age we were supposed to read both Martin Wickramasinghe and T. B. Ilangaratne). Given this state of affairs, isn?t it a sign of our pretentiousness that we denigrate the likes of Prasannarachchi for ?corrupting? our youth (the same way that, on television, Deveni Inima is seen to be corrupting them) when he is getting his market to actually read through a book? Isn?t it a sign of our fake notions of literary connoisseurship that we ignore this aspect to the man and concentrate on airing our prejudices towards the genre he and his work caters to?? ?
In other words, isn?t he doing something, when we are doing nothing?? ?
Think about it.? ?

Aluthgama Dhammananda Nayake Thera:  A life committed to uplift the Sasana
	
Ven. Mahopadyaya Agga Maha Panditha Aluthgama Dhammananda Nayake Thera, a senior member of the Karaka Sabha of the Malwatte Chapter, passed away in the early morning of October 2 at the General Hospital, Kandy following a brief illness. He was 103 years old.? ?
?
He was born on November 22, 1915 in Aluthgama near Thumpane in Kandy District to parents Maha Arambe Rajakaruna Wasala Dukganna Ralahamillage Dingiri Bandara (village headman) and Herath Mudiyanselage Ranmenika. He was named Heenbanda. He received his primary education at Muruddeniya Vidyalaya and?
Idamagoda Vidyalaya.? ?
He was ordained as a novice under the tutelage of Ven. Pahamune Dharmakeerthi Sri Sumangala Thera, the then Maha Nayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter and Ven. Aluthgama Sri Piyadassi Nayake Thera.? ?
He received his education at Sri Sangharaja Pirivena, Kandy and had his higher education at the historic Visumgrama Uposathagaraya at Malwatte Maha Viharaya in 1935.? ?
In 1936 he founded Sri Mahinda Daham Pasala at Ampitiya and was its head teacher until 1950. He started the Katina Cheevara Puja at Malwatte Maha Viharaya in 1944 and held it annually for 73 years. History was created at Malwatte Maha Viharaya in 1944 when two Katina Cheevarayas were placed at the same place and offered to Maha Sangha (Buddhist monks), who lived in the two temples belonging to Malwatte Maha Viharaya. These institutes were namely Malwatte Maha Viharaya and Poya Malu Viharaya. Since the opening of the official Avasa of the Maha Nayaka Thera in 1966, three (3) Katina Cheevarayas were offered to the Maha Sangha after being kept at the same place. This is unique in the Buddhist world. I haven?t heard of such an offering being made elsewhere in the world. State and foreign offerings were received for the Katina pinkamas.? ?
?
As the Buddhist Chaplain at Bogambara Prison from 1950 onwards he? pioneered the construction of a Chaithya, Viharaya and Bodi Prakara at? the premises of the Pallekele open air prison
In 1950, he started teaching at Dharmaraja College, Kandy and taught until 1958 without receiving any remuneration. In 1958 he was chosen for a Governmental teaching appointment to serve as a teacher at Gurudeniya Vidyalaya (1966 to 1972) and again at Dharmaraja College.? ?
He inaugurated Sri Sangharaja Gunanusmarana Sangamaya, Kandy and held the Sri Sangharaja Perahera uninterruptedly for 72 years. He founded the Sri Sangharaja Daham Pasala and Sri Sangharaja Kantha Sangamaya.? ?
As the Buddhist Chaplain at Bogambara Prison from 1950 onwards he pioneered the construction of a Chaithya, Viharaya and Bodi Prakara at the premises of the Pallekele open air prison. A Dhamma school has been inaugurated in the name of Sir Richard Aluvihare, the first Sri Lankan IGP for the benefit of children living in Police?Quarters, Kandy.? ?
In 1951, he started the Poya day Samithiya which is being?operated to date.? ?
?
When the then Government decided to provide a plot of land close to the Maligawa to a church, the Nayake Thera objected and in turn was able to make it a possession of Sri Dalada Maligawa. The Maligawa pilgrims rest lies on that land
When the then Government decided to provide a plot of land close to the Maligawa to a church, the Nayake Thera objected and in turn was able to make it a possession of Sri Dalada Maligawa. The Maligawa pilgrims rest lies on that land.? More than seven thousand cattle were freed from slaughter houses in Kandy by Maha Nauwara Avihimsa Samithiya in which the Nayake Thera was a patron.? He was the President of the Sasanarakshaka Mandalaya of Kadawatha Sathara and Gangawata Koralaya for the past 46 years and held the post of patron of the Kandy District Sasanarakshaka Mandalaya.? ?
In 1973 he was appointed to conduct the Thewawa at Sri Dalada Maligawa. In 1989 he was appointed to the Karaka Sabha of the Chapter.? ?
The Government of Myanmar offered him the prestigious title of ?Agga?
Maha Panditha?.? ?
May our Nayake Thera attain the supreme bliss of nibbana!? ?

Boralesgamuwa accident: Police confirms lady doctor was drunk
	
The police yesterday reaffirmed their earlier claim that the female specialist doctor, who was involved in an accident at Boralesgamuwa in which an IP was killed, was indeed under the influence of liquor at the time.
DIG in charge of Traffic Ajith Rohana said yesterday the police had conducted the breathalyser test following the accident and the test was positive. ?More than 80 milligrammes of liquor was found to be in her blood stream. The doctor had been attending a party prior to the accident. The police have recorded statements from several individuals at the party," he said.
We have also obtained CCTV footage of the party. If needed we will produced this footage in court as evidence,? he said in response to a question asked at a press briefing held at the Law and Order Ministry.
DIG Rohana said if any doctor claims that there was no smell of liquor had emanated from the female doctor without conducting a proper examination, it is of no value. ?The least they should have done was to conduct a laboratory test within a few hours of the accident,? he said.
According to the Supreme Court ruling in two previous cases, the court had ruled that only a breathalyser test or a blood test conducted in a laboratory can confirm whether an individual was under the influence of liquor or not, the DIG explained.
An Inspector of Police (IP) attached to the Police Field Force Headquarters was killed and his wife and two children were injured in a head-on collision involving the female doctor?s jeep in Boralesgamuwa on September 30.
The female doctor was arrested over the accident and remanded until October 9. She had also sustained injuries in the accident and is undergoing treatment at the Colombo South Teaching Hospital under police custody. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

CD handed over to court by CID didn't contain Bond report
	
The CD which was supposed to carry recordings of Former Minister, MP Ravi Karunanayake giving a statement to the CID the investigations which was produced before courts by the CID yesterday did not contain the said recording.
The case brought against the former MP for allegedly giving false evidence at the sittings of the Presidential Commission on the Bond issue that was taken up before
Colombo Fort Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake was therefore postponed for the 10th of this month.
An extension of the suspension orders issued on September 14 on obtaining reports on the telephone conversations recorded on mobile phones belonging to nine individuals including Former Minister Ravi Karunananyake and five other court orders at the request of the CID were also expected to be taken up during yesterday?s proceedings.
However, the CD provided to courts by the CID in their annexure relating to the orders issued, did not contain the Bond Commission's findings and accordingly the Magistrate informed the CID that the requested order cannot be given.
The CID submitting a motion thereafter stated to courts that the Bond Commission report is a soft copy of a download made from the website at the Presidential Secretariat and when the downloading process was taking place various documents presented at the commission sittings and their copies had been downloaded erroneously instead of the Commission Report. The CID apologised to the court about this lapse on their part and promised to present a fresh CD of the Commission's findings on a later date.
Two CD?s said to contain the recordings of evidence on the Central Bank Bond case given by former minister Karunanayake when he appeared before the Bond Commission on August 2, 2017 were handed over to courts by the CID.
The Magistrate, after considering the submissions made, informed court that the order in this respect would be made on October 10 and postponed further hearing for that date. (Nimanthi Ranasinghe)

China didn?t put SL into a debt trap: Envoy
	
The Chinese Government did not get Sri Lanka into a debt trap by lending money to it,? Sri Lankan Ambassador to China Karunasena Kodituwakku has said.
?If anybody is saying that the Chinese government lent money to us to put Sri Lanka into a debt trap, I don't agree with that statement. It's an absolutely wrong conclusion,? Kodituwakku told CGTN's "The Point".
He said the Chinese government assisted Sri Lanka to build the Hambantota project and that it was up to the Government of Sri Lanka to decide whether to build on the basis of feasibility studies, then to make business decisions.
"Of course, we have difficulties in paying back the loan, however the Chinese government never asked us to hand the Port over to them or to the Chinese venture in question. It was a proposal that came from Sri Lanka, asking to enter into a partnership with China,? he added.
As a response to media concerns that China is ?militarising? the Port, Kodituwakku pointed out that "in Sri Lanka's case from the very beginning we very clearly indicated to the Chinese side that it was only an economic venture."
He said Sri Lanka does not allow anybody to interfere with the security of Sri Lanka.We took a decision to shift a naval base to Hambantota Port in July, Kodituwakku explained, adding ?The security of the Hambantota Port, the territorial integrity of Sri Lanka in the Indian Ocean, is entirely a matter for the Sri Lankan security forces to worry about. China never asks us to compromise on this aspect."
Kodituwakku said he remains optimistic over the long-term prospects of the Port and the future of Sri Lanka's role in an emerging Asia.

Frequently asked questions about cancer
	
?
The human body comprises millions of cells. In a healthy person these cells grow, divide, form new cells and die in a controlled manner. However due to environmental factors, diet, genetics or simply due to random chance, this control can be lost in some of the cells. This will result in the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells which can not only outlive their ?normal? counterparts, but also divide much faster. When this occurs in a solid organ it will form a tumour which can be felt or if its in an internal organ detected via radiological imaging like Ultra Sound, CT or MRI scans. Hence, this condition is identified as a cancer.? ?
Where can you develop a cancer? ? Cancers can occur in almost every part of the body. According to the cell which the cancer starts from they are divided into several types. Some of them are:? ?
Carcinoma ? Starts from cells that line the outside and the inside of the body. These are the commonest type of cancer in adults. Eg: Breast carcinoma, Lung carcinoma, Colon carcinoma etc.? ?
Sarcoma ? Arises from cells in bones and other soft tissues like muscles, fatty tissue, fibrous tissue. Eg: Osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, Leiomyosarcoma etc.? ?
Leukaemia ? A cancer originating from blood forming cells. It starts in the bone marrow and enters the blood stream. Depending on the time taken to progress it can be classified as acute or chronic. Leukaemias are further sub divided according to the type of white blood cell (Lymphocyte, Myelocyte) affected. The commonest cancer in children by far is Acute Lymphocytic Leukaemia.? ?
Lymphoma ? Starts in lymph nodes or other tissues of the immune system. It is commonly present with enlarged lymph nodes. There are two main types of lymphomas. (Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma)? ?
Brain and spinal Cord cancer? It originates from neural tissues. Exact site and type varies according to the tissue involved. These cancers do not usually spread to other parts of the body. Eg: Gliomas, Medulloblastoma, Ependymoma etc.? ?
The spreading?of a cancer?
Differentiated cells are confined to one part of the body. Eg: Liver cells are seen only in the liver. However cancer cells have a unique ability to start from one part of the body (eg: breast) and spread to a totally different part. (Eg: Lungs, liver, bones). This spread can be through direct extension, blood stream or lymphatics. This ability makes them hard to eradicate from the body. This also means that if you detect a cancer early before it has started to spread there is a better chance of complete cure.? ?
?
Common types of cancers?
When you take both sexes together worldwide lung cancer is the commonest cancer followed by breast cancer and colon cancer. The situation in Sri Lanka is slightly different. The commonest cancer in Sri Lankan males is cancer of the mouth and surrounding areas followed by lung cancer. In females in Sri Lanka breast cancer has the highest incidence by far. Uterine cervix and thyroid cancers come next.?
Is cancer incidence increasing??
Yes, there is a trend of increasing diagnosis of cancer patients. There are multiple causes for this. Cancers commonly occur in aged cells. With current medical advances we live longer compared to several decades ago. Therefore the chances of a cancer occurring is higher in the present day human being. There is an increasing number of cancer causing agents in the environment of today. This increased exposure to harmful environmental agents might be another reason for the increase in cancer incidence. Lifestyle changes have also contributed to rising cancer incidence. The best example of this is poor diet, substance abuse and a sedentary lifestyle. In developing countries improving medical care leading to better detection of cancers that previously when undiagnosed might be an additional contributory factor. Therefore a combination of all these factors can explain the rising incidence of cancer. An encouraging fact is that although the number of cancer patients is increasing in most countries deaths due to cancers are decreasing. This is mainly due to the successes of the modern cancer medicine.? ?
?
Are all cancers fatal?
Dear Readers,??Health Capsule will be introducing a weekly series of articles on various topics related to cancer, their causes, diagnosis, treatment, etc.? commencing with today?s edition. The weekly series will feature the expert opinion of Dr. Sanjeeva Gunasekera, Consultant in Paediatric Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Sri Lanka (Apeksha Hospital). Stay tuned with Health Capsule as we bring you the latest and the most informative updates on the various intricacies surrounding cancer and on how best to overcome the disease.? ? ?
		
No. When it comes to aggressiveness there is a lot of variability in cancers. Some cancers can be completely cured with minimum treatment while in some, even with very aggressive treatment, chances of complete cure is remote. However with the current medical advances outcomes of cancer treatments are rapidly improving. Even if complete cure is not possible novel treatment methods can help cancer patients by prolonging life, relieving symptoms and improving the overall wellbeing.? ?
?
Preventing cancer?
Some cancers can be prevented. Today we know that some agents will directly increase the risk of a cancer. Reducing the exposure to these agents can decrease the chance of you developing a cancer. Eg: Tobacco smoke. It is clearly proven that abstaining from smoking can greatly reduce the occurrence of some types of lung cancers.?

He?s not aware of what goes right under his nose!
	
?
This story is about the doings of a former local politico who is now functioning as the coordinating secretary of a high political authority.
?
The man, a thick pal of numerous shady characters from the days he was a local politico, is now reportedly using his secretarial position to help his buddies whenever they get into some scrap or caught red-handed committing an immoral or an?illicit act.
He would often tell the law-enforcing authorities that he is speaking on behalf of his boss and that the latter wants them to go easy on the culprits under arrest.
The powerful politico concerned is blissfully unaware that his authority is being abused by his secretary for his own private gains right under his nose, they say.? ??

## Title: Importance  of being  Karu J Analysing pros and cons of Karu J as next UNP Presidential Candidate
## Section: Opinion

Importance  of being  Karu J Analysing pros and cons of Karu J as next UNP Presidential Candidate
	
Karu most distinct disadvantage for the next Presidential Elections is the number of years? ?
	Accepted by Sinhalese Buddhists and the Clergy? ?
	Minorities trust him as a friendly, patient, and amiable negotiator? ?
	His expertise as an able private sector executive played an indispensable part??
	?
A people who elect corrupt politicians, imposters, thieves and traitors are not victims...But accomplices?
~George Orwell? ?
Karu Jayasuriya?s political career started in the mid-nineties. Karu Jayasuriya, born on September 29, 1940, came to limelight after he became the Mayor of Colombo from 1997 to 1999.? ?
His expertise as an able private sector executive would have played an indispensable part during his tenure as Mayor of Colombo for him to be considered amongst the best of Colombo?s Mayors of all time.?
It was during his time that the city of Colombo looked like a typically clean and utterly habitable city at all-comers.?
The unassuming posture that he displayed when relating to the highest and lowest of society brought him a reputation that no present-day politician could boast about.? ?
Yet, this same unassuming conduct on his part did, in fact, hinder his rise to the top of his political party, United National Party (UNP).? ?
That unassertive, patient and modest approach to a profession, which at all times demanded a cavalier and aggressive demeanour from those who practised it, may have halted his rise in the short run, but when considering the long-term sustainability of an astute politician, such a demeanour is a concealed advantage.? ?
The only indisputable disadvantage is that with a person who is already in his sixties trying to play the long-term game, the passage of years keeps piling up, making him look much older when the real time comes to assert himself.? ?
?
By the year 2020, when the Presidential Elections are due, Karu will be 80 years old or young. J. R. Jayewardene climbed the proverbial greasy pole of politics when he was 71 years old
?
Karu Jayasuriya?s most distinct disadvantage in being considered for the next Presidential Elections candidate is the number of years.? ?
By the year 2020, when the Presidential Elections are due, Karu will be 80 years old or young. J. R. Jayewardene climbed the proverbial greasy pole of politics when he was 71 years old.? ?
As a result, as was most aptly and illustratively penned in his biography by Professor K. M. de Silva, JR, when he assumed power in 1977, looked more like an old man in a rush rather than a calculating strategist for which he was reputed.? ?
However, it is not fair by both JR and Karu Jayasuriya to be compared against each other.? ?
Times have changed and have taken a nasty toll on a rapidly deteriorating political culture, which in its intrinsic core has come out as a mirror of the changes that our society has been painstakingly enduring during its meandering course.? ?
In 2018, the UNP and its coalition Government are undergoing a serious yet an inscrutable course change.
The UNP, for all its pomp and boast over the last two-and-half-years, yet cannot accurately claim that it had really won any victory at the electorate, especially in the Sinhalese Buddhist voter base.? ?
This is exactly where Karu Jayasuriya?s claim to the highest job in the land matters.? ?
His acceptance among the Sinhalese Buddhists and specifically among the Buddhist clergy coupled with the trust and faith reposed on him by the minorities as a friendly, patient, and amiable negotiator have contributed to him being considered for the job.?
Given these divergent advantages, Karu J might appeal as the best candidate, provided Ranil Wickremesinghe opts to keep out of the Presidential Election as the UNP candidate this time as well.? ?
Yet, one glaring and tangibly intense disadvantage that remains is his age and lack of enthusiasm and demand from the youth, at least as yet.? ?
Nevertheless, Karu J seems to enjoy immense trust from the country?s civil organizations, whose prime platform is law and order, transparency and accountability.
His stringent allegiance to the process as against substance, taken in the context of sophisticated political calculation, might stand in good stead as it is the process by which a socio-political change could be attained and then administered as much as a substance that very process is supposed to be executing.? ?
However, blind adherence to the process could, in the realm of politics, harm the politician, who tries to empower that process.? ?
In an environment in which optics matters more than the process and substance, it is scrupulously hard to market a politician and his policies and principles to the large mob of voters.? ?
Against such a confusing backdrop, let us examine once again the key elements that the next UNP or UNP-led Presidential Candidate need to have in his or her bag in order to run a legitimately aggressive and successful campaign:? ?
1. The Maha Sanga? 2. Unstinted support of the minorities? 3. Intangibles including leadership, youth and charisma.? ?
Does Karu Jayasuriya have the potential to garner the support of these key elements? Karu J certainly has the first two. And in both those categories, he enjoys the highest degree in the first. And in the second element, he is either better than or equal to Ranil Wickremesinghe.? ?
It is in the intangibles that Karu J falls behind both Sajith Premadasa and Navin Dissanayake, the other two plausible contenders.? ?
Some might argue the cases for Champika Ranawaka, Rajitha Senaratne and even Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka.? ?
While Sarath Fonseka would disqualify himself as a loser as recent as in 2009, both Champika and Rajitha would have to climb a steep hill, in convincing the UNP voters, as authentic UNP members.? ?
So, we are back to square one.? ?
If Karu Jayasuriya is not the so-called Dark Horse, then who is it?
Is there any other who would wear that badge, Dark Horse? There doesn?t seem to be any. However, what is not mentioned in the above formulation is a quality of the candidate as perceived to be a winner.? ?
While acknowledging that this is no final pitch for a UNP candidate, it must also be borne in mind that time is not in favour of the United National Party.? ?
It might be all too late for a brand new candidate to get his gear together and run an effective and winning campaign.? ?
Who might be the opponent? There are a consistent hue and cry about one particular Rajapaksa whose country-loyalties might be belonging to continents far, far away from Mother Lanka.? ?
As a matter of fact, that very element of the political formula may very well work against the grain of commonsensical politics.? ?
Those who profess patriotism and thunder from atop lofty towers need to come down at least every now and then to listen to their own consciences.? ?
What seems to baffle an ordinarily educated mind does not seem to astonish these Rajapaksas, who have over the last two decades and a half shown unlimited capacity for avarice and hunger for power.? ?
Yet, the failure on the part of the present coalition Government to bring these violators of basic ethical norms and perpetrators of alleged financial crimes to justice has caused the public to lose faith in the Coalition Government.
This failure has further engendered a notion of suspicion and distrust among the curious public; it has heightened and aroused the stigmatic aura that some members of the governing party are colluding with the Rajapaksas in order to pave the way for a total exoneration of the alleged culprits.?
Therefore, the options are limited and hard to discern.? ?
If the election of Maithripala Sirisena was a watershed in our politics, in the event of a comeback of the Rajapaksas, the next Presidential Elections might well be a reversal of all the hopes and aspirations of a?susceptible public.
Such vulnerabilities apart, any collusion or even a hint of collusion by any members of the current administration with the Rajapaksas will amount to a grotesque miscarriage of justice.? ?

JO vows to defeat 2019 budget and form interim govt.
	
The joint opposition would pool all its power to defeat the budget 2019 and form an interim government until the general election scheduled to be held in late 2019, with Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister under President Maithripala Sirisena, SLFP rebel group frontliner and former Minister S.B.Dissanayaka said yesterday.
He said that all progressive forces including members of the Tamil and Muslim political parties and a section of the UNP who were disappointed and dejected over the policies of the UNP and party leader would be invited to join the interim government.
The SLPP led by Mahinda Rajapaksa would be the leading party of the proposed interim government, he added.
When pointed out by the Daily Mirror that there was a risk of SLFP members including Mahinda Rajapaksa losing their parliamentary seat if they sought SLPP membership, Mr. Dissanayaka said it could be sorted out as the new interim government would be formed under President Sirisena with Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister.
?The main objective of forming an interim government is to save the country and nation from this calamity. The economy is in shatters. Exports have been slowed. Rupee is depreciating daily and prices of all commodities rising with no control. Not only the low income families but the lower middle class is also trying to make ends meet. We try to put an end to this predicament faced by people and give them some relief. We have the full support for the interim government from the MEP led by Dinesh Gunawardana, Democratic Left Front led by Vasudeva Nanayakkara, National Freedom Front led by Wimal Weerawansa, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya led by Udaya Gmmanpila, Ceylon Workers Congress led by Arumugam Thondaman and somany other Muslim and atamil parties,? he stressed.
However, Mr. Dissanayaka admitted that Mr. Wickremesinghe was a shrewd and seasoned politician with a clear economic vision but his advisors are outdated and have no new ideas. It was because of their policies that brought Mr. Wickremesinghe?s downfall in 2004. (Sandun A Jayaskera)

Judging character by the Sun Sign - Pisces
	
? ? ? ? ? ? ? Natal Solar Month and Sun Sign ? Part 12? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
?
?
The Sun in its annual journey round the Zodiac moves in the Solar sign of Pisces from March 15 to April 13 and those born during this period are called Pisces subjects.?
Possess psychic powers
We know that those born when the sign of Pisces is rising from the horizon are assigned the Pisces Lagna and those born into the Pisces Lagna are greatly influenced by the characteristics of the Pisces sign and those born during the Solar month of Pisces too are influenced by the Pisces sign. The Pisces subjects, be they of the Pisces Lagna or of the Pisces Solar month possess psychic powers. Physically they are not strong.?
A calm and placid exterior
Pisces people usually maintain a calm placid exterior.? But inwardly they are very unstable as they are subject to strong emotions.? They are very sensitive and they would go into a flurry even over a trivial matter.? Sometimes they would take to drugs or alcohol to drown their sorrows or overcome their ruffled feelings.??
Lovers of art and beauty?
Pisces subjects are lovers of art and beauty. They are charitable and generous. They have a keen sense of gratitude.?
Pisces people do not get reliable friends and one of them would turn a Judas at a decisive hour in their life
Not revengeful
These subjects do not get easily provoked. Once provoked, they are slow to cool down.? Unlike Scorpio people, Pisces people do not harbor ill will or malice towards anyone. Therefore, they are not revengeful.
Pisces are people are quick to change their opinion on a given issue. They do not like to stick to one profession or one workplace either. If the native happens to be a male, he would have an intimate affair with a widow which would turn out to be a scandal.?
Astrologers say that Pisces subjects are usually loquacious and some go to the extent of being garrulous.?
Attain high position by perseverance
Generally, Pisces subjects attain high positions by the dint of sheer perseverance.? They do well in art, literature and poetry.
The Pisces sign rules the feet and the lymphatic system and they are prone to diseases that can affect these parts of?
the anatomy.
Ideal marriage partner
Persons born during the Solar month of Pisces are advised to marry a person of the same sign or of Cancer or Scorpio.?

## Title: Knowing your blood report

Knowing your blood report
	
?
Many decades ago, only a handful of laboratory investigations were available to diagnose diseases or to support the diagnosis of even critical diseases. Even those few tests had many limitations due to inaccuracies, human errors and limited research. Fortunately, we live in? the 21st Century where the world is flooded with medical laboratory tests which can interpret the body?s illnesses with much higher accuracy and precision.
Therefore it is important for us to have a basic idea about the common laboratory tests that are commonly done in the healthcare setting.? ?
In this week?s Health Capsule we have consulted Dr K.A.C. Wickramaratne, Senior Lecturer in Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Karapitiya, to educate you about another common haematological test requested by clinicians; the blood picture. Blood smear, peripheral blood picture, blood film and peripheral smear are some other names used for this investigation.?
?
?What is a BP?
We now know that a Full Blood Count (FBC) gives an idea about quantities of different cells in the blood.? ?
The blood picture examination on the other hand, is a direct observation of blood cells in a stained blood smear using a microscope to assess changes in shape, size (quality) and quantity of blood cells. To put simply, Blood Picture is a ?snapshot? of blood cells that are changed due to an illness. Various details about the type and severity of the illness could be obtained through this snapshot.? ?
The cells in blood include red blood cells (erythrocytes), white blood cells (leucocytes) and platelets (thrombocytes). Red cells, whose main function is transporting oxygen to the cells, are tiny bags filled with haemoglobin. When looked under a microscope, they resemble ?ulunduwadai? or doughnuts, with a flat centre and an inflated outer rim.?
?
White blood cells are a group of different cells including neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils. Each white cell type has its normal unique quantity, shape, size, colour and are useful in fighting infections. Platelets are tiny particles in the blood that are required for blood ?clotting,? Dr. Wickramaratne said.? ??
In different disease conditions these cells can have abnormal shapes, shades or appearances which can be precisely observed by microscopic examination by a haematologist.?
?
?
When the doctor requests for a BP
Your doctor may request a Blood Picture on many occasions ranging from fever to anaemia and in case of prolonged vague symptoms like joint pain. It can be ordered simply to differentiate viral fever from bacterial fever, but Blood Picture will help diagnose serious illnesses like blood cancer too.? ?
In case of Anaemia (deficiency of haemoglobin, the blood pigment in blood), Blood Picture is important in determining underlying cause for anaemia.? ?
If the patient is having unexplained fever, vague ill health, bone pain, non-specific symptoms, loss of weight, loss of appetite etc, BP examination may play a pivotal role in diagnosing a possible serious underlying disease condition like leukemia or lymphoma.? ?
?
No precautions nor preparations?
No preparation or precautions are needed. You can give the blood sample at any time. Blood should be collected from a peripheral vein by a neat venipuncture. (or by a finger prick or heel prick).? ?
?
The sample needed for BP preparation
The sample needed for a BP is same as for Full Blood Count. The correct volume of venous blood in a special tube with a chemical called EDTA is suitable for BP. Or else, a finger can be directly pricked (with a device called lancet) and blood coming through the prick can be directly used to prepare BP. In babies heel prick can be used to collect a blood drop on to a slide for BP preparation.? ?
The information?that can be?gathered in a BP
The slide containing the smeared blood is further prepared and observed under the microscope by a haematologist, who interprets the findings, taking the patient?s clinical signs and symptoms into consideration.? ?
Similar to FBC, we can gather much information related to disease from BP. Findings in the blood picture can be matched with FBC results. Therefore, laboratories prepare blood pictures when FBC results are abnormal to verify those.? ?
In anaemia, if the red cells are smaller and have various shapes and sizes, it is most likely to be due to a deficiency of iron. Larger red cells could indicate vitamin B 12 deficiency. Diagnosis of malaria, different types of haemolytic anaemia (anaemia due to destroying of red cells) like thalassaemia and sickle cell disease can be made by the blood picture examination.? ?
White blood cell morphology is very useful in diagnosing viral infections, bacterial infections, leukemia and lymphoma etc.? ?
Platelet number and its appearance in the BP can be assessed to diagnose some disorders of platelets.? ?
Changes can be seen in all three types of cells in certain disease conditions.? ?
Interestingly, even though a sample of blood is checked, changes in BP reflects diseases not only in blood, but also diseases in many other organs such as liver, kidney, bowels, lymph nodes and bone marrow as well.? ?
?
Interpreting a BP
A report has a description of each cell subtype; red cells, white cells and platelets. At the end of the BP report, there is a comment, conclusion or suggestion. This is the final interpretation of findings in the smear and related clinical features.? ?
The changes in blood cells can be age related and also vary due to some physiological conditions such as pregnancy. Therefore, correct age, sex and the physiological status etc. are very important to be mentioned in the request for the haematologist to interpret while reporting the BP.? ?
?
How quality of a sample can be affected?
If the sample is directly collected at a centre within a hospital, there is minimal cause for concern since the test would be performed in a short period of time and reported.? ?
However, if the centre that collected your blood sample does not have laboratory facilities or a haematologist, try to find out where the test is done, if a qualified haematologist is available and how the samples are transported to the laboratory. All these factors can affect the quality of your report and as a result, further management of your disease condition.? ?
?
Repeating BP?
There are various tests like fasting blood sugar, which are repeated periodically. However, unless the treating physician decides, BP is usually not repeated.? ?
Blood Picture report is a very valuable tool in diagnosis and management of patients with diverse disease conditions. Make sure you supply correct information about your condition to your doctor to get maximum information about your illness in the Blood Picture report.? ?

Leo Burnett wins Sri Lanka?s first D&AD Impact Pencil for Petal Paint
	
Leo Burnett Sri Lanka, the only D&AD awarded agency in Sri Lanka, has earned the distinction of winning Sri Lanka?s first ever coveted ?Wood Pencil? at the D&AD Impact awards in London, in the Environmental Sustainability category for its Petal Paint Campaign for JAT Holdings. This was made possible through a special collaboration with Leo Burnett Toronto.? D&AD Impact Awards identify and celebrate great, transformative, creative ideas from around the world that have had real impact and, ultimately, contribute towards a better, fairer and more sustainable future for all.? In keeping with the ethos of the awards, Leo Burnett?s Petal Paint demonstrates how a Sri Lankan brand can connect with people through a social mission by staying true to its larger purpose of ?transforming spaces.? Through Petal Paint, flowers offered at temples have now gained a new purpose beyond a single offering, making them live forever on temple walls in an eternal incarnation that will never fade away.
The Environmental Sustainability award category evaluates ideas that help preserve the natural world and the capability of the environment to support life. The category spans innovations that work towards preserving ecosystems; products or campaigns which support people to reduce their environmental impact; creating services and systems around efficient energy sources; taking action against climate change or fighting waste and pollution.
Petal Paint is an initiative that pays homage to Sri Lanka?s rich heritage of temple art, often found in the form of captivating wall murals in temple shrine rooms. The creative campaign consisted of extracting the pigment contained in temple flower offerings to create a range of safe, long-lasting paints and use them for the creation and restoration of temple art. In Buddhism, flowers signify the impermanence of life. Their highest purpose is to become an altar offering. But due to the high volume of daily worshipers, flowers offered at temples get discarded within minutes. This results in millions of fresh flowers getting wasted daily. By extracting the pigment contained in these temple flower offerings, Leo Burnett created Petal Paint in collaboration with JAT Holdings. The flower offerings are collected from various temples across Colombo and taken through a drying process, after which their natural pigments are extracted to create Petal Paint.?
The former Managing Director of Leo Burnett Sri Lanka, Ranil de Silva, was instrumental in initiating the campaign during his tenure and advising the team throughout towards its successful conclusion. Commenting on the awards, de Silva said, ?It is indeed a great honour for Leo Burnett to be awarded the highly prized ?Wood Pencil? at the prestigious D&AD Impact awards.? From the inception of the Petal Paint campaign we knew we were onto a ?big? idea not just in terms of creativity and innovation, but also as a sustainable initiative in tune with the local ethos of Sri Lanka. It was an intensely collaborative effort with many stakeholders coming together, inspired by the idea of turning temple flowers into petal paint to restore temple art. I am ever so grateful to Anthony Chelvanathan, from Leo Burnett Toronto, for his dedication and the world class craft support that took this idea from good to great. Kudos to the entire team at Leo Burnett for turning this initiative into a global prize-winning campaign.??
Adding further, the Managing Director of JAT Holdings, Aelian Gunawardene said, ?JAT Holdings is a sustainability driven company with a solid commitment to sustainability in all areas and we are proud that our Petal Paint campaign in partnership with Leo Burnett has been recognised and awarded at the D&AD Impact awards. Petal Paint is a unique idea and perhaps the first-ever globally to recycle and reuse temple flowers for the noble cause of restoring temple art, which is part of our national heritage. The Petal paint campaign reflects our approach of fresh thinking to solve an environmental challenge by creating a distinctive and innovative product to cater to a specific need.??
Commenting on the accolade, Arosha Perera, CEO of Leo Burnett Sri Lanka said, ?This triumph at the highly-regarded global D&AD Impact awards reflects the high benchmarks we have set for ourselves at Leo Burnett Sri Lanka. The entire Petal Paint concept, from start to finish, was a deeply spiritual creative endeavor for all of us at the agency and we are thrilled that our fresh and insightful creativity was recognized for its sustainability elements and out-of-the-box thinking. I must take this opportunity to applaud Janath Gamage from Leo Burnett Sri Lanka for the idea that was born of his passion for creativity. It just shows how the power of new thinking can add creative magic and impact to brands. I am grateful to our client, JAT Holdings, for their support and for placing their faith in us in delivering a creative concept that is truly world-class.?
Leo Burnett has become a crucible for creativity and great thinking, producing to be executed in a fresh, relevant and insightful manner to add value to clients? brands.The agency conveyed the sustainable and eco-friendly benefits of this unique paint through a touching campaign which evoked the culture and heritage of Sri Lanka. As Leo Burnett celebrates its 19th year of operations in Sri Lanka and looks ahead to the future, the agency will continue to focus on its Human Kind approach to help build powerful brands and meaningful partnerships with its clients, while delivering gratifying results and gaining peer recognition in the industry.

Lets learn from Gibran!
	
Sri Lanka?s education authorities are yet to address the stress issue associated with exams despite Minister of Education Akila Viraj Kariyawasam stating that moves are underway to reduce the subjects for the Ordinary Level (OL) Exam from nine to six.? ?
He has said that one of the reasons behind bringing about a change to the education system is that the syllabus is outdated. Many wise men however believe that the real reason behind children struggling at school is due the outdated thinking of educational authorities, teachers and most parents.?
?
Just the other day there was a striking post on social media which said, ?A child educated only at school is an uneducated child?. This is why most bright students are masters at exams, but resemble fish out of water when life throws challenges?at them.? ?
The Minister has also said that the workload on children studying for the OL Exam is to be reduced to ensure that they meet the challenges of a changing world. He also said that the change would also help open up vast new fields and make?children happier.? ?
We saw how the focus of parents shifted towards children on October 1 unlike on other days. The occasion marked ?World Children?s Day? and kids were pampered with meals and drinks bought at fast food outlets. But is this what children need; a single day set aside for the year where they can be extremely happy???
What about the other 364 days???
A few years ago we heard of a death in Norwood when a schoolgirl by the name of Arseratnam Dayalani hung herself after failing the OL Exam for the second time.
There have been other records of children committing suicide and or making attempts at taking their lives due to exam pressure. The solution to this problem doesn?t entirely lie on reducing the subjects. Something has to be done about the attitude of elders who brand ?slow learners? as failures. The worst form of punishment is given to these kids when teachers reject them by making the statement ?teaching them is a waste of time?.? ?
Renowned poet Khalil Gibran had no schooling during the initial years of his life. Later when he entered school he excelled at art. Gibran went on to write some of the most inspiring poems which relate to children. In the poem ?Your children? Gibran gives a strong message to teachers and parents. These lines in the poem ?You may give them your love but not your thoughts, for they have their own thoughts? are epic.? ?
We?re killing our children even before they think of taking their lives. So much is stuffed into their brains inside classrooms that teachers have for a moment forgotten that only the lessons that remain in their memory can be termed as?real knowledge.? ?
Most teachers know that they are bad teachers when they meet their chargers two to three years after parting with them and realise during a quick chit-chat that they have not acquired anything beyond the chapters of the books they finished?with them.? ?
Teachers have to create that interest for a subject. How they would succeed at that is a big question given that these are times where marks are considered as the yardstick defining success.? ?
Just the other day President Maithripala Sirisena sounded a warning by stating that parents should pay attention to the challenges faced by children when he attended the prize giving of a leading school in Balapitiya.? ?
The challenges that children face aren?t confined to the classroom and books. They must be shaped to be well-rounded. That?s why Gibran goes on to say in the poem ?Your Children? that ?You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forward?. Push children so that they move forward, but not too hard because they may fall!? ? ?

Lion cub nursed by female Labrador
	
An incident that had occurred for the first time in Sri Lanka in 2014 was revealed today, where a Lion cub from the Dehiwela Zoological Gardens was taken care of at a private home in Moratuwa and fed by the owner's female Labrador after the lioness had disowned this cub.
The lioness had given birth to four cubs, but three of them had died after their mother rejected them.
The Zoo authorities who were committed to save the surviving lion cub and had searched for a 'foster mother' and found ?Shelly?, a Labrador which had just given birth to some puppies at the time. The cub was placed in her care.
National Zoological Gardens, Director General Dammika Malsingha said the owner did us a big favour when the Zoo authorities were wondering how to save the surviving cub.
At first the owner Heshan Mendis had refused saying it was illegal to raise a lion cub in a private house but had later agreed after Zoo authorities assured him that there would be no issue.
?The lion cub was in a critical condition. It looked like a cat and I feared that ?Shelly? would hurt him. As the little cub was so weak we tried to feed him soon. We made several attempts and by the following morning, Shelly began to cuddling and nursing it,? Mr. Mendis said. ?There was no difference, though it was a lion cub. It played with the puppies just like one of them."
The cub remained at Mr. Mendis?s residence for three weeks. He was then returned to the Dehiwala Zoo and by then the zoo authorities had imported the necessary milk for the cub.
Mr. Mendis said he was sad to let the cub go.
?Even Shelly had not appetite for two days. We have given her puppies to other people before. But we never saw her as upset as the day on which the cub was taken away. Shelly and the cub were closely bonded by then,? he said.
Mr. Mendis said the Lion was his favourite animal and that he had never thought he would have this one in a million opportunity to adopt one.
?The three weeks with the cub was my most difficult time but also the happiest. I could only sleep for two hours as the cub had to be fed every two hours,? he said.
The cub which was returned to the Dehiwala Zoo was later transferred to Ridiyagama Safari Park. He is now four years old and roaming free unlike the other animals at the Dehiwala zoo.
Mr. Mendis had visited the cub when he turned two years.
?He recognized me when I touched him. He stared at me with love,? he added.
However, Shelly who fed the cub had not received the opportunity to meet the cub due to health and other security issues.
Mr. Mendis had named the cub as ?Badi? however the zoo authorities had given it a different name.
However, when contacted Zoological Gardens Director and Veterinary surgeon Dr. Chandana Rajapaksa said in the wake of this incident the Zoo authorities had imported sufficient stocks of milk to avoid such issues. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

LKR depreciation against the USD Is being ?socially conscious?  the way forward?
	
?
Federal reserves have been increased to 20% but it was at 0% during crisis time
One usual thing is that the CB has to use foreign reserves
?
During last September, Sri Lanka experienced a rapid depreciation of the rupee (LKR) against the US Dollar (USD). Since June, the value stood at Rs. 161.17 but it kept falling during the last week of September and the value now stands at Rs. 170.56. Several factors such as the strengthening of the USD and the China-US trade war contributed to this phenomenon. Amid speculations that this would negatively impact a middle income country like Sri Lanka, the matter isn?t as bad as for currencies in India and Pakistan which have seen depreciation in currency above 10% against the USD. While suggestions are being made to be socially conscious and cut down on expenses, the Yahapalana Government also suspended vehicle permits to MPs, ministers, state sector employees and others in a move to ease the pressure on the LKR.? ?
In this backdrop, the?Dailymirror sheds light on what exactly happened and how the islanders could recover from this fall.? ?
?
?
A call to be socially conscious?
According to National Policies and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha De Silva, the dollar rate increased with the increase in federal reserves in the US. ?Many emerging markets had capital flowing in from the US. But with the increase in federal reserves a lot of capital started flowing back to the US from these emerging markets. Therefore Current Account Deficit countries such as Sri Lanka felt its impact more than Current Account Surplus countries. These include countries such as Australia, India, Pakistan, Turkey and even China.??
?
According to observations made by Amarasekere, if not for such foreign exchange leakage during the above period of over USD 30,000 million Sri Lanka would have been having more than adequate foreign exchange reserves today
?
?As a result prices of goods will increase,? he continued. ?Now what we do is we try to hold imports. The fuel price formula is working well and we can control the consumption of fuel. In addition to that we need to be socially conscious and try to save energy. If your air conditioners were at 190C turn them to 260C, save electricity etc. We import USD 20 billion every year and we need to cut down around USD 5 billion by cutting down foreign travel and buying luxury items etc. I have to credit the Central Bank for not panicking and burning reserves. Next year we need to pay USD 4 billion for the bonds obtained by the country, but the CB has more tools,? he said.?
He further said that during the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime exports were at 27% but after the period of this regime exports have dropped to 12.5%. ?If we need to develop as a country we need to export more products,? Dr. Silva added. ?Exports have a positive impact on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). We also need to secure international ties such as the Singapore Free Trade Agreement and joining the ASEAN Plus Six. By integrating we can diversify our inputs. This is what we need to do in the medium term.? he added.
?
Rupee already a weak currency
In his comments Sirimal Abeyratne, Professor in Economics, University of Colombo said that the rupee is already a weak currency. ?Therefore it has a higher vulnerability to external shocks. It is weaker because it has been depreciated over the past 40 years. Federal reserves have been increased to 20% but it was at 0% during crisis time. This year they want to increase it by 2.5% which will happen in two more occasions and in 2019/2020 they are trying to increase it to 3.5% as per the monetary policy plan. This is the basic interest rate which will influence all other countries,? Prof. Abeyratne said.
He further said that in terms of a short term measure, we are left with limited options. ?One usual thing is that the CB has to use foreign reserves,? Dr. Abeyratne continued. When there is an excess demand for dollars in the market, the CB can release reserves, but it will be a waste of resources for a limited time. We also need to pay our maturing debts. Import controls are another crucial aspect. To my understanding Sri Lanka doesn?t have an open market economy and therefore more imports will make matters worse. We need to get ready for long-term policy measures. Sri Lanka has managed its debts and has a good track record of paying debts,? he said.
?
What Amarasekere?s book tells us??
According to Nihal Amarasekere?s book titled ?Fiscal Management, Lack of Public Accountability?at 15% leakage, the exports proceeds leakage from the country from 1993/94 to 2016/17 could be estimated to be well over USD 30,000 Mn. He further states that there is no purpose in promoting exports if the exports proceeds are not fully repatriated to the country. In his book Amarasekere refers to a voluntary survey carried out in 2004. According to the survey, 50% of the exporters both registered at BOI and non-BOI responded and reported that 81% of their exports proceeds are repatriated by the end of the next quarter. It also revealed that 10.5% of their exports proceeds have been utilized abroad for the purchase of assets etc.? ?
?
?
Sri Lanka already has higher nominal and real interest rates compared to some of the countries who had raised interest rates at least a couple of times during this year.

The survey has also revealed that there had been ?ghost, non-existent exporters? as per the voluntary questionnaire returned undelivered. He observes that these are the parties who had created such ?ghost export companies? and claimed bogus VAT refunds perpetrating the colossal VAT frauds discovered in 2003/04. According to observations made by Amarasekere, if not for such foreign exchange leakage during the above period of over USD 30,000 million Sri Lanka would have been having more than adequate foreign exchange reserves today.? ?
?
Chances attracting new money low??
The Central Bank in its 6th monetary policy review for this year kept the policy interest rates unchanged, much to the surprise of many analysts who bet that the monetary authority would increase rates in line with other Asian region economies such as India, Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippines.? ?
The Monetary Board of the Central Bank kept the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) at 8.50 percent and Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) at 7.25 per cent. The market had expected hikes for both. Speaking at a recently held press conference, CB Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy said that Sri Lanka already has higher nominal and real interest rates compared to some of the countries who had raised interest rates at least a couple of times during this year.? ?
Relatively slower growth, moderating money supply and credit growth, contained inflation and tight liquidity conditions were cited as the key reasons behind the policy decision.? ?
Governor Coomaraswamy further said at this juncture a rate increase would not have either brought in new money into the country or encourage investors, who are already here, to stay.? ?
?In the current conditions, where there is money moving out of the emerging markets, given that Sri Lanka is a twin deficit country, chances of Sri Lanka attracting new money are very low. Then you have to ask whether we can keep the people who are already here by increasing rates? We have US $ 1.5 billion worth of institutional investments in rupee securities at the moment. By increasing interest rates will we encourage those people to stay here? The answer to that is also no,? he said.? ?

## Title: Media freedom: The good, the bad and the Ugly
## Section: Opinion

Media freedom: The good, the bad and the Ugly
	
?
How free are Sri Lanka?s media and how responsible are they socially? Experts, media activists and senior journalists expressed their views within the scope of this question at a landmark symposium to mark the 20th anniversary of the Colombo Declaration on Media Freedom and Social Responsibility.? The 1998 declaration is a milestone in Sri Lanka?s media history.? It paved the way for the abolition of the draconian and archaic criminal defamation law which had been misused by the powers-that-be to intimidate and penalise journalists. It also led to the setting up of the Press Complaints Commission of Sri Lanka, a non-statutory body promoting?self-regulation.
Another of the 1998 Declaration?s achievements was the passage of the Right to Information Act.? Despite its few flaws, this piece of legislation is regarded as one of the best RTI laws in the world and it, indeed, has empowered the citizens, though much needs to be done to explain its benefits to grassroots level people who are being lied to and misled by unscrupulous politicians and bureaucrats.??
However, the 1998 Declaration?s two key aims remain unfulfilled. One of them is the abolition of the Press Council Law, under which a government-appointed Press Council operates to address the grievances of those who are wronged or defamed by the Press.? The council can initiate legal action against a newspaper or magazine if, in its opinion, the newspaper or the magazine has defamed someone.? This is a good arrangement, only as long as the council maintains its independence.? But the issue is there is room for interference and abuse. Self-regulation activists say their opposition to the Press Council is based on the provision that the Council has the power to jail journalists and publishers.?
A free press is a key feature in a vibrant democracy, where self-regulation by the press itself is preferred to regulate media freedom rather than a government-imposed and politically manoeuvrable mechanism. Perhaps, some Sri Lankan political leaders out of sync with democratic values and enlightened principles see in the Press Council Law an instrument to gag the media.? Or, perhaps, the Press Council Law is still relevant in the absence of a rule to make membership in and compliance with the industry-led self-regulation mechanism ? the PCCSL ? compulsory for registration as a newspaper or a magazine.? At present, the PCCSL membership is voluntary, and most mainstream newspapers and periodicals have voluntarily subscribed to its rulings and accepted the Editors? Guild?s code of practice. But there are those which still have not.? Years ago, a mainstream popular Sunday newspaper withdrew its recognition of the PCCSL following a trivial dispute.??
The Colombo Declaration?s other key objective is the enactment of contempt of court legislation. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, in his speech at Thursday?s ceremony to mark the 20th anniversary of the 1998 Declaration, said, ?We can go into the contempt of court issue. We need legislation but we have to remember there are other stakeholders -- including the judiciary. We have to work together with judiciary and Parliament. We need laws on contempt. I don?t think it?s impossible. The Parliament oversight committee on the judiciary can also go into it but this requires extensive consultation.?
?
Journalism may be one of the best of vocations and may be hailed as the voice of the voiceless and the watchdog or the fourth estate to monitor the government?s actions.? But there are good journalists, bad journalists, evil journalists and those masquerading as journalists
?
The sooner this law is enacted the better it is for Sri Lanka?s democracy, given the surge in contempt cases in recent months and years, and also given the need to insulate judges from allegations of?judicial dictatorship.?
Another key area that drew much discussion at last week?s symposium was the possibility of extending the self-regulation mechanism to electronic media and online media, which, at present, virtually have a free run, with some of them enjoying the freedom of the proverbial wild ass. The symposium was told that the Norwegian media have adopted such an all-encompassing self-regulation mechanism.
The symposium also saw some media activists turning the searchlight inward to express their disgust at sections of the media which abuse the new found media freedom after the 2015 change of government.? ?
Journalism may be one of the best of vocations and may be hailed as the voice of the voiceless and the watchdog or the fourth estate to monitor the government?s actions.? But there are good journalists, bad journalists, evil journalists and those masquerading as journalists. Good journalism is largely an ideal concept and there are only a few who sincerely strive to practise it.? Bad journalism manifests when media practitioners lack professionalism.? Evil or ugly journalism is found when journalists become pawns of politicians and businesses. There is no harm in a media outlet supporting a particular politician or political party, provided it openly declares its endorsement of the politician or the political party.? It is not ethical journalism when we bash the guy whom we hate or with whom we have some personal disputes and cover it up with a public interest label. If journalists resort to skullduggery like politicians, and twist and turn news to promote the agendas of politicians, political parties or businesses, then they are qualified to be called ?presstitutes?.?
Journalist and worker rights activist John Swinton (1829-1901), who worked for the New York Times and, later, other publications, described such journalists as intellectual prostitutes.?
Of such intellectual prostitutes, he said:?
?The business of the journalists is to destroy the truth, to lie outright, to pervert, to vilify, to fawn at the feet of mammon, and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread. You know it and I know it, and what folly is this toasting an independent press?
?We are the tools and vassals of rich men behind the scenes. We are the jumping jacks, they pull the strings and we dance. Our talents, our possibilities and our lives are all the property of other men. We are intellectual prostitutes.?
Journalists who are embedded to a political agenda or to a businessman to make money through backdoor channels only produce bastardised news.??
People with high media literacy can spot such crooks in journalism. But how many of us are taken for a ride daily by stories planted by unscrupulous journalists?
In journalism, we say dog does not eat dog, but we are duty bound to expose the scoundrels among us, for our silence in the face of blatant deterioration of professional standards and ethics is tantamount to endorsement of foul journalism.

Outcry as India deports seven Rohingyas to Myanmar
	
?
DPA, 04th OCTOBER, 2018- India deported seven Rohingya men to Myanmar on Thursday amid protest by human rights groups.
The handover took place hours after India?s Supreme Court rejected a plea by attorney Prashant Bhushan to let the seven men stay in India as they feared reprisals in Myanmar.
The men came from Myanmar?s Rakhine state, where the government launched a brutal military crackdown in August 2017.
?The human rights situation in Myanmar has deteriorated completely. Returning them to Myanmar puts them at grave risk of serious human rights violations & violates customary international law,? Amnesty International India tweeted.
?It?s unfortunate that SC [Supreme Court] has allowed the Govt to deport 7 Rohingya refugees to Myanmar despite all UN & International human rights organizations saying that Myanmar has committed genocide against Rohingyas,? Bhushan said on Twitter.
He added that sending them back to Myanmar ?would make them liable to torture and murder.?
The men were repatriated after reconfirming their willingness to return, the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement. The identity of the men had been established with the assistance of the government of Myanmar, it added.

SLC Ex-Co alleged to have approved Rs. 130mn in payments before term lapsed
	
The former Executive Committee of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) is alleged to have approved a mammoth outlay of more than Rs. 130 million at a meeting weeks before their term lapsed on May 31.
This amount includes ex-gratia payments to Chairman and Members of Sub-Committees and Special Committees along with payments amounting to Rs. 8.7 million being directed to advertising firms, figures shown to the Daily Mirror by sources revealed.
The chief allocation was for Rs. 50 million towards the Sri Lanka Premier League Tournament which was subsequently postponed.
Interestingly, among the other payments allegedly approved at the May 2 meeting, were payments amounting to Rs. 49.7 million divided between six clubs to carry out various development work, with a majority of those clubs connected to individuals commonly known for their links to a powerful former official.
Six clubs
The six clubs, to whom these alleged payments were made are, the Moratuwa Sports Club (Rs. 3.5 million), Panadura Sports Club (Rs. 10 million), Wennappuwa Sports Club (Rs. 7.3 million), NCC (Rs. 10.3 million), Colombo Cricket Club (Rs. 10 million) and Ragama Cricket Club (Rs. 8.2 million), while a further Rs. 10 million allocated for the development of the Army Grounds at Dombagoda.
The list of alleged approved payments included that of Rs. 300,000 as a ?Vesak Donation? to one of the provinces associated with SLC, while Rs. 8.75 million had been allocated to 23 major and minor districts as annual administrative grants.
When the Daily Mirror contacted former President of SLC Thilanga Sumathipala to verify the authenticity of the alleged payments and the process followed when approving and monitoring such payments in the interest of transparency, he neither confirmed nor denied it.
Annual budget
?We controlled an annual budget of Rs. 5 billion, so I cannot tell you how much was approved at a single meeting,? Sumathipala said.
?We did a lot for cricket (during our tenure) and it is disappointing to see what the (Sports) Minister has done to the Sport,? he said, referring to the absence of an elected body at SLC and the lack of a timeline for elections.
Another official of that Executive Committee confirmed that the payments had been approved, though he did not specify the exact amount, but claimed that these kinds of payments were common and done in a transparent manner.
?We had a careful vetting process in place when approving these payments, and we pay only a certain amount up front, with the rest being paid upon completion,? he claimed, arguing that this ensured there was transparency in the process.
While it is common practice to make such payments for development purposes the timing of it, weeks before the SLC Election of office bearers was scheduled to be held on May 31, brings into question the motives of it.
SLC?s Constitution, that dictates the process through which office bearers are elected, has long been criticised by former cricketers and administrators who claim that it allows for candidates to buy the votes of clubs through such payments.
It has been long argued that the only way to de-politicise cricket administration is by changing the voting structure currently in place, however successive Sports Ministers have shown little interest in doing so.

SLFP should cut off ties with UNP before mulling over tie-up with JO: MR
	
Referring to speculations about the Joint Opposition planning to join hands with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) led by President Maithripala Sirisena, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa today said the SLFP should first break ties with the United National Party (UNP) and subsequently they could consider such a tie-up.
Addressing the media following an event held in Colombo, former president Rajapaksa said they would not support the SLFP while they are with the UNP and added that no agreement had been made reached between the joint opposition and the SLFP in this regard.
When inquired whether he discussed these matter with President Sirisena, Mr. Rajapaksa said they had held several discussions earlier.
Meanwhile, he said the Police had now become a corrupt department and added that it was similar to the underworld.
?The underworld will not be curbed as long as this government is in power. The underworld nowadays have the sponsorship of the government. The government is protecting IGP Pujith Jayasundara even though some serious allegations have been levelled against him,? he said.
?Not only the IGP, but the government would also protect any state officer as its responsibility,? he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Spark?18? A Resounding Success? Hosted by Royal College , Colombo
	
Changing the innovation landscape for the betterment of Sri Lanka, Royal College took a giant stride when it hosted Spark?18, the largest innovation and invention exhibition in Sri Lanka from 25 to 28 September 2018. With Sri Lanka ranked a mere 88th in the Global Innovation Index in terms of innovation performance, Royal College saw an opportunity to enhance the country?s innovation capacity by inspiring the younger generation.
With over 700 exhibits on display, the thousands that attended the four day long exhibition would have been awestricken and amazed by the talent of the school children, who have thought out of the box in coming up with ideas, innovations and inventions to solve many day to day problems.? Innovations displayed were not limited to those students of Royal College, but also included innovations from children representing schools from across the country, both rural and urban.

The one for the road went awry!
	
?
A rush bid by a powerful provincial politico of a council which is at the fag-end of its term to award several tenders to a select few was thwarted by a white-collar high -up who intervened on time, they say.
?
The white-collar high-up had swung into action when his subordinates had brought into his notice of the pressure being applied by the politico to expedite awarding tenders to his selectees to collect a big kickback before going out.
Livid with anger for scuttling his last chance bid, the powerful politico is reportedly going around threatening to take disciplinary action against the white-collar ones concerned, they say.

## Title: The ultimate cure for knee pain
## Section: Medicine
## Date: 5 October 2018 12:07 pm
The ultimate cure for knee pain
	
?
Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis affecting millions of people worldwide. Rheumatoid arthritis will have a similar effect on the knees, but to a lesser extent. The disease process will damage inner lining of the bone within the joint, changing its surface from smooth to rough. As the damage continues, the knee will be swollen and painful. Walking, climbing steps and getting up from a seated position will be very difficult.To bring you more information about knee surgery and replacement we decided to speak to Dr. Chandana Herath, Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon, who serves at the Base Hospital, Nuwara Eliya.? ?
?
Medication
Unfortunately this condition can?t be cured through medication. Your problem can only be controlled. There are many expensive so called cartilage growing and repairing tablets, local and imported oils, milk powders, pastes and injections which are extensively marketed and advertised in newspapers, television and other media. None of them will help to cure the problem. Sometimes anti-inflammatory medication will help to reduce joint swelling and relieve pain as long as medication is taken. The pain will return when the effect of the drugs weans off.? ?
?
Injecting drugs into?the joint?
Medications somewhat similar to what is taken orally can be given in higher dose into the joint. It will temporarily reduce swelling and pain, however it will neither cure nor correct deformity of the knee.? ?
Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) injection may help during the early stage of the disease in younger patients. However, in moderate to severe arthritis it has no place. Only reliable solution is knee replacement, usually necessary when the knee joint is worn or damaged to the extent that your mobility is reduced and you experience pain even while resting.? ?
?
Knee replacement surgery?
Metal and plastic parts are used to cap the ends of the bones that form the knee joint, along with the kneecap. The surgery usually takes about one to two hours.? ?
?
Advantages of knee replacement?
There are two (2) major advantages; regaining mobility and reliving knee pain. Both will restore your quality of life.? ?Other advantages are the reduction of medication, which will reduce many side effects and the less clinic visits will save money and time.? ?
?
Major surgery?
Knee replacement requires a major surgery and hospitalisation. The surgeon replaces the damaged portions of the knee with plastic and metal parts.? ?
?
Success rate
The device usually lasts well over a decade. The procedure is being used more and more for younger people with osteoarthritis (OA) and other degenerative knee conditions. About 85 percent of artificial knees still work after 20 years.?
?
?
The best age?
There are no absolute age or weight restrictions for total knee replacement surgery. Recommendations for surgery are based on a patient?s pain and disability, not age. Most patients who undergo total knee replacement are between the ages 50 to 80, but orthopaedic surgeons evaluate patients individually.? ?
?
Anaesthesia?
The two major types of regional anesthesia used most frequently in joint replacement surgery are epidural block and spinal block. In a spinal block, the anesthesia is injected into the fluid surrounding the spinal cord in the lower part of your back. Epidural anaesthesia is the best since pain relief medication is continuously delivered through a tiny plastic tube (nerve catheter) placed next to the nerve and can last for 2-3 days.? ?
General anaesthesia also could be used to perform the surgery.? ?
?
Blood loss
Blood loss is minimal and will be about 100ml during the procedure. Drain may collect about 125ml per day after the surgery and this could vary. Your doctor will decide whether you need a blood transfusion.? ?
?
Is it painful?
Postoperative pain, swelling, and bruising are a normal part of the recovery process following knee surgery. However, there are ways to manage the pain and ease your recovery.? ?
?
Time taken for full recovery
You will be able to get off the bed the next day and sit on a chair. Then knee bending physiotherapy will be commenced and you should be able to stand with the help of a walking frame. The next day you will be asked to walk a few steps, climb a few stairs before you go home. Usually a physiotherapist will help you to gain mobility.? ?
?
Going home?
It is usually a three night stay for an uncomplicated patient. But this depends on your associated medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, asthma, kidney problems. Your doctor will decide whether you need HDU or ICU care during the first two days after the surgery.? ?
?
What to do at home
You need to follow knee physiotherapy at home while continuing medications as directed by your surgeon. You should be able to stop using your crutches or walking frame and resume normal leisure activities six weeks after surgery.? ?
?
Visiting the surgeon after surgery?
Your wound will be inspected one week after the surgery. If clips were used to close the wound, they will be removed two weeks after the surgery.? ?
Having a shower?
We will recommend you not to wet the wound before the skin clips are removed i.e one week after surgery. You may have a shower with the operated leg covered with a waterproof cover. Having a shower after two weeks is safe.? ?
?
Driving a car
You may drive a car when you are comfortable. We would recommend you not to drive or ride bicycles for eight weeks after the surgery.? ?
?
Replacing the?other knee?
There are patients with both knees being affected in severe osteoarthritis. However, we can wait up to three months before doing the next knee replacement. This replacement can be done at the same time as the other if both knees are really bad.? ?
?
Common complications?
Knee replacement surgery is safe. You will be thoroughly assessed before the surgery to identify and optimise your medical conditions. However, there may be a risk when undergoing major operation. In such case there is the risk of bleeding, being infected, the breakdown of the wound, clotting of blood and the latter forming in the deep veins in the leg can cause pain and/or swelling. However these developments are rare and present in less than 1% of the patients.? ?
?
The lifespan of a knee replacement
For 80?90% of people who have total knee replacement, the new joint should last about 20 years, and it may well last longer.? ?

UK, Dutch calls Russia ?pariah state? over alleged cyber attacks

REUTERS, 04th OCTOBER, 2018-Britain and the Netherlands accused Russia of running a global campaign of cyber attacks to undermine democracies, including a thwarted attempt to hack into the U.N. chemical weapons watchdog while it was analyzing a Russian poison used to attack a spy.??
In some of the strongest language used by the West since the Cold War, Britain said Russia was acting like a ?pariah state?. The accusations were backed by other Western countries including the United States, which said Moscow must pay a price.??
Russia denied what its Foreign Ministry spokeswoman called a ?diabolical perfume cocktail? of allegations by someone with a ?rich imagination?. But the accusations deepen Moscow?s isolation at a time when its diplomatic ties with the West have been downgraded over the poisoning of an ex-spy in England and it is under U.S. and EU sanctions over its actions in Ukraine.? ?The British and Dutch accusations were unveiled as NATO defense ministers gathered in Brussels to present a united front to their Cold War-era foe.??
?This is not the actions of a great power, these are the actions of a pariah state,? British Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson told reporters.??
U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said he agreed with the British and Dutch assessments. Russia must pay a price and a number of response options were available, he said.??

UN accuses former Norwegian peace envoy Solheim of squandering
	
UN Environmental Programme (UNEP) Head Erik Solheim, former peace envoy to Sri Lanka, has been accused by UN internal auditors of over spending for his travel.
According to Aftenposten News, auditors found that 4.1 million Norwegian kroner (USD 490,000) had been spent on travelling for 529 days during his first 22 months in office.
The UN internal auditors have requested Solheim pay back part of the money he has spent on his trips. Many of these trips were allegedly made without sufficient documentation from Mr. Solheim.
On two occasions,?the 63 year old switched to a more expensive airline, incurring an additional cost of almost 60,000 NOK, according to the auditors.
The issue came to light when a draft report by the UN?s Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) on the business travels of Erik Solheim and other senior UNEP staff was released.
The draft was presented to Solheim, who may now respond and put forward possible corrections. A new version will then be prepared at a later time. When the UNEP management responds again, the OIOS will publish the final report.
Solheim, who at the moment is participating in the climate summit in San Francisco, has not commented on the conclusions of the report, stating that it is just a draft document.
?We have responded and refuted a number of mistakes in this draft document. Based on our response the auditors will present a new draft. After we have commented on this draft, they will conclude their final report,? he said.
Meanwhile, a Norwegian source, well acquainted with the UN system, said the UN?s internal oversight services rarely changed the factual information or important recommendations made in the first draft.

Universal Teacher?s Day (October 5):  Impact of teachers on children
	
Education is not to be treated as an abstract idea or a theory or philosophy. It?s a life-long process and is something related to the actual experience of life. It should aim ultimately to equip a young man or woman with such qualities of character as to enable him to face the day to day challenges in society.? ?
The primary aim of education is to help the children grow up to be men and women with a total development of their personalities. While being children, they must be helped to develop all elements that go to form the personality. They must be given guidance to maintain a balance among these elements. There is a general agreement that a fundamental aim in education should be the development of intelligence. Intelligence is that which brings balance, harmony, beauty and proportion to life.? ?
J. Krishnamurthy, an eminent Indian philosopher, in his book on ?Intellect, Authority and Education? says, ?It is clear that merely to cultivate the intellect, which is to develop the capacity or knowledge does not result in intelligence. Intelligence is not something related only with reason but also with feeling.?? ?
?What Krishnamurthy wanted to convey is that generally intelligence is considered to be something related to human brain and the intellect. The feeling is totally eliminated. Therefore an intelligent man is the one who is developed intellectually and emotionally.? ?
Thus the physical, intellectual, emotional and moral development of an individual is the broad definition of the fundamental aim of education. (Learning to be, a UNESCO publication)? ?
?
There is a general agreement that a fundamental aim in education should be the development of intelligence. Intelligence is that which brings balance, harmony, beauty and proportion to life
?
If education aims at the development of the physical and intellectual aspect of the child, neglecting his aesthetic, moral and spiritual aspect is not a total education and it will not produce individuals with totally?developed personalities.? ?
Therefore the schools must provide opportunities for the child to strengthen his growing body, his skills, to train the nerves and muscles, to teach him good hygienic and dietary habits, and above all to struggle and resist the temptation offered to him to destroy his moral personality by modern society in the form of alcohol, drugs, sex etc.? ?
The child should be helped through education to understand that self-confidence, emotional balance, aesthetic enjoyment are all dependent upon the harmony, health and the vitality of the body.? ?
The role of a teacher is very vital for the success of any educational system. But today, the teacher?s role has assumed a new form and meaning. There were times in which teachers were considered as those who imparted knowledge, who store the pupil?s brain with information.? ?
The pupils were receptors of this information in a passive manner without any active involvement in the learning process. At times it was considered irreverent to ask question from teachers.? ?
Therefore an autocratic social climate prevailed throughout the classroom which was not at all conducive to a child?s total development. But in the modern educational system the teachers assume a new role. They are no longer ones who impart knowledge.?
They are the ones who partake in the process of learning, along with the child. Today?s education is a child-centred one in which the whole attention is focused on the child.?
Teachers must back every effort to arouse the spirit of inquiry in the child by relating the environment to academic work. Children must be encouraged to discuss by themselves, various aspects related to their lives, personality and environment. In this task the teacher acts as a stimulus.?
The teacher must create in the child the love for nature and must help the child to find delight in beauty that nature had created. Moral development of the child should engage the primary attention of the teacher. Their conduct must be exemplary and they must love the children with a spirit of understanding.? ?
The teacher?s task especially in a developing country like Sri Lanka with a traditional culture, is of great responsibility. Today?s children are open to a number of educative influences and TV, radio, internet, DVDs, social media etc have tremendous impacts in shaping the attitude of children to life, world and their?
immediate environment.? ?
The teacher?s task is to study these factors from which children imbibe their values and relate it to formal education in such a way that they may not find a conflict or confusion between what is taught in the school and what they learn from the environment.?
Thus, today the teachers cannot claim to have the monopoly of education. They are co-ordinators of educative influences. It is said, ?Ages of changes are ages of conflict.?? ?
Today our country and society are on the verge of great changes and upheavals. Traditional values are being threatened by the values that are being propagated through the mass media.? ?
The children are bound to be affected and influenced by all these forces of social changes. They are bound to encounter mental confusion. It is the duty of a teacher to understand the emotional problems of the children generated by these social changes and to liberate them from such mental confusion. The teacher must create in them values that are beneficial to the individual and society. They must broaden their outlook and provide them with noble ideals.? ?
I wish to conclude this article with a passage in ?Towards Relevance in Education? (Bogoda Premaratne Report of the Educational Reform Committee, 1979; p.130)? ?
?The teachers can no longer consider themselves as dispensers, rather, they are sharers of knowledge. They do not lord it over their class. Humble and willing to learn through professional training and from their pupils, they will go with them hand in hand as an adventure?.? ? ?

US investments can save nations like SL from debt traps: US
	
Investments backed by the US government provide a financially-sound alternative to state-led solutions which lead nations like Sri Lanka into debt traps, a top US government official said.
Executive Vice President of the US Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), David Bohigian, who visited Sri Lanka from October 3 to 5, said OPIC was committed to supporting projects that promote free and open societies while adhering to strong environmental and labour standards.
?We look forward to partnering with Sri Lanka and other regional allies to identify opportunities for investment in ports and other infrastructure, which will fuel sustainable economic growth, create jobs, and leave countries better off,? he said adding Sri Lanka is a hub of maritime activity in the Indian Ocean and serves a vital role in the global economy.
The US Embassy said in a statement that OPIC, the US government?s development finance institution, has invested $118 million in Sri Lanka and currently has almost $20 million invested across four projects.
It said the visiting US delegation met Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera as well as representatives of American businesses active in the Sri Lankan market.
Meanwhile, Charg? d'affaires Robert Hilton said they were working with the Sri Lankan government to ensure that American companies were given the opportunity to compete for government tenders and that tenders were conducted fairly and free from corruption.
He said the US was the single largest export market for ?Made in Sri Lanka? garments. ?We would like to grow US exports to Sri Lanka, from agricultural products to manufactured goods to software and entertainment,? Mr. Hilton said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Visa regulations to be relaxed to boost tourism: Dept.
	
The existing regulations on extending Sri Lankan online visa facility would be relaxed to encourage tourists, an official of the Immigration and Emigration Department said yesterday.
The Visa and Border Controller of the Immigration and Emigration Department Chaminda Hettiarachchi said the Department was planning to relax the online visa regulations.
?Already online applications are available. But conditions like sponsorship will be relaxed,? he said.
The Department is issuing visas for 30 days from the date of arrival although it may be extended up to six months, the Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) said.
The ETA is the visa issuing authority attached to the Immigration and Emigration Department.
?Discussions are underway to provide facilities to extend the online visa facility without any hurdles,? Hettiarachchi said.
Meanwhile, the Government?s attention had been drawn to relax the visa regulations for countries such as China, India, France, German, the United Kingdom and the Middle Eastern countries to promote tourism.
Tourism Development Minister John Amaratunga earlier said the visa issuing regulations would be relaxed to meet the tourist arrival targets in the country. (Indika Sri Aravinda)

What next for GMOA cartel? SC ruling compels Health Minister to revamp Medical Council
	
?
SC ruling left the GMOA and its allies in complete disarray
	What would now be the fate of their two-year plus ?Anti-SAITM? campaign?
?
The Supreme Court (SC) on September 21, 2018 upheld the Court of Appeal (CA) ruling of January 2017 that requires the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to provisionally register the petitioner, a medical graduate of SAITM.??
The SC ruling had left the GMOA and its protesting allies in complete disarray as to what would now be the fate of their two-year plus ?Anti-SAITM? campaign.??
The SC ruling also raises issues as to what the fate of the present SLMC should be.??
Everything about the medical faculty of SAITM very plainly revolves around the SLMC -- its refusal to accept the SAITM medical faculty as good enough a medical education institute to teach and train medical practitioners.??
The CA decided otherwise in January 2017. It was in line with the petitioner?s position that the SAITM medical faculty is far better equipped than even the Kotelawala Defence University(KDU)?medical faculty.??
This was said in plain language by Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne in Parliament on February 9, 2017.??
Responding to JVP MP Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa, Minister Senaratne said, ???a hospital with 1,000 beds (referring to SAITM) was decided not enough for ?clinical? practice. How was KDU given approval? KDU was approved in 45 minutes. That report had only two pages. You know the SLMC report, don?t you? What was said?
?
If SLMC members have any self-respect left with them, they should all resign from the SLMC for such open and public condemnation of their conduct
?
?Excellent training? it said. But there was no hospital. Even without a hospital (SLMC) said ?excellent training??..? (Sinhala/Column 1144 in Hansard)??
The competency and bona fide of this same SLMC were very much questioned and left in serious doubt by the SC itself on September 21, when it delivered its ruling on the petition filed by the SLMC, requesting the SC to rescind the ruling given earlier by the CA.??
In delivering its ruling the SC wrote:??
?The SLMC has claimed that it is the sole regulatory authority with regard to the medical profession and has professed that it is deeply concerned with the standards of medical education.??
?If that was the case and if the SLMC was bona fide of the view that SAITM was not entitled to be recognised as a ?degree awarding institute,? the SLMC would have, undoubtedly, sought to challenge the validity of ?P4? and ?P5? when they were issued in 2011 and 2013.??
?However, the SLMC did not make any application to a court disputing the validity of ?P4? and ?P5?.???
The SLMC under Prof. Carlo Fonseka?s presidency was also proved to have altered the ?10-member? committee report on the ?status and quality of medical education at SAITM medical faculty? with all but three members opposing such indecency and incivility.??
?Now it is public knowledge, Professors Narada Warnasuriya, Nilantha de Silva and Colvin Goonaratna opposed any alterations to the committee report. Those who wanted it altered to suit their uncompromising ?Anti-SAITM? stand, were all medical professionals representing trade unions (GMOA and FMTA) that publicly stood for the abolition of the SAITM?medical faculty.??
The alteration, therefore, was made to say the SAITM medical faculty degree cannot be accepted by the SLMC for registration.
The alterations in Page 18 of the said committee report was mentioned by the CA as well and had mentioned in the SC ruling too.?
It says, ?In this connection, SAITM has annexed, as part of the documents annexed to P-20, an unsigned report said to have been prepared by the ten-member team appointed by the SLMC.??
The body of this unsigned report is on similar lines to the detailed report P-19 (d).??
However, the conclusion is a recommendation by the team that the SLMC ?recognizes graduates of the Faculty of Medicine SAITM as suitable for provisional registration, subject to following conditions:?These conditions include the provision of access to a ?busy state hospital, so that students can be given intensive clinical exposure of one month each in Medicine, Surgery, Paediatrics and Obstetrics and Gynaecology?..?, (emphasis added)??
We thus have an SLMC whose conduct and bona fide was twice condemned and deplored, once in Parliament by the Health Minister under, whose purview the SLMC is and now for the second time, by the apex body in our judicial system, the SC.??
If SLMC members have any self-respect left with them, they should all resign now from the SLMC for such open and public condemnation of their conduct.
They don?t seem to have such self-respect even the often ridiculed politicians have in this country. During the last three years, we saw three ministers resign, condemned by the public. Not so, the medical professionals in the SLMC, even after the SC questioned and doubted their bona fide very much.??
All of it now demands a total revamp of the SLMC on public interest. The present SLMC loaded with medical professionals elected and nominated by two trade unions, with the rest also being medical professionals have proved, it decides solely on the interest of trade union representatives.??
On the present Medical Ordinance, the GMOA has the muscle power to elect eight members to the SLMC.
Another nine deans of national university medical faculties sit, with their nominations endorsed by Faculty of Medicine Teachers? Associations (FMTA), who have often given into pressures of the university students as well.
This, as Prof. Colvin Goonaratne publicly said, totals 17 TU representatives out of 23 members in the SLMC.??
This was said to be the main reason for his resignation as SLMC President for a mere nine months.??
These ?trade unionists? it is claimed, don?t even allow any serious discussion at SLMC meetings, forcing their pre-decided TU positions on the SLMC. The SLMC altering its ?10-member? committee report was none but that.??
With the existing Medical Ordinance, this number will keep increasing further.??
Two medical faculties have already been approved for Sabaragamuwa and Wayamba Universities. These would be functional in about four months from now. Thus in 2019, there will be not 9 but 11 deans sitting in the SLMC. These numbers are not restricted and depend on the number of State university medical faculties.??
Therefore, there is no guarantee this number would remain as 11 deans in the SLMC, with two more medical faculties proposed for Moratuwa and Uva-Wellassa Universities by a private member motion in Parliament, mooted by JVP MP Dr. Jayatissa.??
The SLMC should not be under medical professionals alone for reasons that are best known to the minister.??
The conduct of this SLMC was exposed by Minister Rajitha Senaratne in Parliament on February 9, 2017, who said it had double standards. One for KDU and another for SAITM.??
?Taking registration for that (KDU), they now send students to the Sri Jayawardenepura General Hospital. Now that?s how registration was taken. If Neville Fernando appointed Gotabaya as CEO then, it would have been approved then itself,? he said.?
Health Minister Senaratne, therefore, should not allow this to continue. It is his responsibility and duty to immediately intervene in revamping the SLMC, in the interest of public and national health. In public interest, the SLMC should not be ?the sole regulatory authority with regard to the medical profession.? It is said, Prof. Colvin Goonaratne has provided Minister Senaratne with a proposal, outlining how the SLMC could and should be restructured anew with other professionals and civil society representatives included. Perhaps, he has a time frame too for this restructuring proposal.??
I have written in these pages, how modern and democratic Medical Councils are constituted in countries like the UK, Australia and Canada.
Perhaps, Minister Senaratne has better and more access to such democratic ?models? that can be adopted to suit our national?health needs.??
It would be best if the minister entrusts the responsibility of restructuring the SLMC to Prof. Goonaratne, a medical teacher, SLPC Chairman continuously for almost a decade, a member of the SLMC till his appointment as its President, apart from his other achievements the minister may know better, if, as we have heard, he has already made a proposal for restructuring of the SLMC.??
It is also the responsibility of Minister Senaratne to have the proposal for restructuring in public domain. Restructuring SLMC should not be a closed door, politico-academic exercise. It is also the social responsibility of Prof. Goonaratne to now make it a public document if he had handed over such to the minister.??
These restructurings need serious social discourse before they get into legal form. Now is the time for that with the SC further consolidating the CA ruling with an emphatic mention, ?.?.if the SLMC was bona fide of the view that SAITM was not entitled to be recognised as a ?Degree Awarding Institute?, then the SLMC should have challenged it without delay.??
Yet, ?the SLMC did not make any application to a court disputing the validity of P4 and P5,? that defines the validity of SAITM as a medical degree awarding institute. That, therefore, makes SLMC and GMOA irrelevant in deciding a total revamp of this discredited SLMC. The decision is with the Health Minister and wishes he would stand up to?that responsibility.??

Woman's paramour sent her nude photos of daughter
	
A story of a young man having love affairs with a mother and daughter duo, both at the same time, was reported from a village in the Siyane Korale area.
The mother, a good looking woman, was a teacher who had been separated from her husband and had been living with her daughter. On her way to school one day she had spotted a well-built good looking youth who captured her attention. They started a conversation and from there they fell in love. Phone conversations between the two often lasted for several hours and with that they even started texting and sending each other photos of their activities apart.
Meanwhile, the women's daughter, who was a beauty in her own right, started using her mother's mobile phone. Quite by chance she came across the photos sent to her mother by her mother's new 'catch'. It was love at first sight for her. She too started seeing the young man on the sly. Both the mother and the daughter continued their love affairs keeping it secret from each other.
As the days passed by the teacher began to feel suspicious of her daughter's movements and then discovered that her paramour was having a secret affair with her daughter as well. The youth had sent several photos of her daughter to the mother?s phone and while browsing through them she observed some nude photos of her daughter taken by her paramour. Losing her temper, she dragged her daughter and went to the police station, taking her phone with her in order to see that justice was served and the youth taught a lesson by the police.
Seeing the photos on the phone after it was activated by the policeman she became agitated and started blaming the daughter who in return rebuked her saying that she should have been more concerned about her own daughter. The mother, feeling humiliated as a result of this, made a hasty exit from the police station while her daughter exited from the back of the police station in a happy mood. (Ignatius Anthony)

World Court orders US to ensure Iran sanctions don?t hit humanitarian aid
	
?
REUTERS, 04th OCTOBER, 2018-The World Court ordered the United States on Wednesday to ensure that sanctions against Iran, due to be tightened next month, do not affect humanitarian aid or civil aviation safety.
Judges at the International Court Of Justice (ICJ) handed a small victory to Tehran, which had argued that sanctions imposed since May by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump violate terms of a 1955 Treaty of Amity between the two countries.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rejected the decision. He said the United Nations court, often called the ?World Court?, had no jurisdiction over the sanctions, which Pompeo said were essential to U.S. security interests, and that Washington would ?terminate? the little-known treaty with Iran.
?This is a decision frankly that is 39 years overdue,? Pompeo told a news conference. ?Iran is abusing the ICJ for political and propaganda purposes and their case, as you can see from the decision, lacked merit.?
