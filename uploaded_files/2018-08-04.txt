No one objected on pay hike: Kiriella
	
Public Enterprise Development Minister and House Leader Lakshman Kiriella said yesterday there was no objection from anyone at the July 17 party leaders meeting to the proposed pay hike of parliamentarians in line with the salary scales of judicial officers.
He told Daily Mirror the salary of an MP is linked to that of a High Court Judge, the salary of a deputy minister to that of an Appeal Court judged and a Cabinet minister's salary equated to a Supreme Court Judge.
The minister said Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and Deputy Chairman of Committees Selvam Adaikkalanathan and party representatives such as, Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan, TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran, Ministers Mahinda Samarasinghe, Nimal Siripala de Silva and Mano Ganeshan, JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, joint opposition?s parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardane and EPDP leader Douglas Devananda, attended the meeting.
When asked for a comment, Mr. Sumanthiran said there was no proposal for any salary increase and pointed out that the salary scales of lawmakers were linked to those of judges.
He said there was an upward revision of salaries of judges in January, 2018 and accordingly, the salaries of law makers were bound to rise. (Kelum Bandara)

PC polls delay- JO members to meet EC
	
The representatives of political parties functioning under the joint opposition will meet the Elections Commission on Monday to discuss matters relating to the provincial council elections, an official said yesterday.
Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman G.L. Peiris told Daily Mirror yesterday he and Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) leader Dinesh Gunawardane and some other MPs would attend the meeting.
According to the EC there is a gridlock with regard to conducting the elections because of the enactment of new legislation to change the electoral system for such elections.
However, Prof. Peiris said the EC must take action to conduct the polls and in case there were problems with the new law, it should conduct the polls under the old system.
He said the Interpretation Ordinance provided for it and pointed out that three PCs had been dissolved some ten months ago while three more councils would be dissolved in October and that his party would take legal action if the EC delayed the polls any further. (Kelum Bandara)

Prez, PM won't allow pay hike: Mannaperuma
	
President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will never permit any salary increases to ministers and MPs, Deputy Environment Minister Ajith Mannaperuma told a media briefing yesterday.
?I am telling you with responsibility that neither the President nor the Prime Minister will not allow the proposed salary increase to MPs and ministers,? he said. ?I can confirm that those who have opposed the move are the very same people who had proposed such an increase at the recent party leaders meeting."
The deputy minister said no final decision had been made by the government on the salary hike.
Focusing on the joint opposition-led protest rally at the Town Hall on Thursday, he said the statement made by former president Mahinda Rajapaksa that the government had failed to keep its promises to penalize corrupt individuals was correct.
?Mr. Rajapaksa was correct when he said the present government had failed to penalize the corrupt. This is because there has been a delay in the judicial procedures. The FCID has finalized more than 100 files on corruption and have handed them to the Attorney General to file action but there has been a delay,? he said and added that hearing such cases would be expedited through the newly set up Trial-at-Bar.
Referring to another statement made by Mr. Rajapaksa that a future government led by him would pay attention to the assets offered to various countries by the present government under various agreements, the deputy minister said it was the former government which sold the land opposite Galle Face Green and sold outright reclaimed land under the Port City Project.

Reminiscing the ?golden era? of Visakha
	
?
A mixture of basic emotions like fear, excitement, amusement and surprise besieged the two school-leavers- in their early twenties-when the Director recommended to their supervisor that they would assist in carrying out Visakha Vidyalaya?s Hostel audit for the year 1966. Visakha, as we knew, is one of the most prestigious Girl?s schools established in Colombo. It was B.R de Silva & Co,-Chartered Accountants, that entrusted the writer, who joined them as a trainee, to visit Vajira Road, with specific instructions on adhering to the organisation?s code of conduct. Behaviour within client?s premises regarding the first stirrings of admiration, passion, desire and the more lasting kind of feelings occur under restricted freedoms. This was five decades ago. However we were confident that upholding the company?s dignity and decorum wasn?t a phenomenal task.? ?
?Being inside the state-of-the-art new auditorium on the 23rd instant in itself was a cause for pride for this writer. This was when I saw the Portrait of Mrs Jeramius Dias?, a gracious lady, born Selesthina Rodrigo and a descendant of his home town, Panadura, pompously displayed right below the clock on right end of the wall. However, I was stunned when the organisers commenced the event ?on the dot?: considering the usual practice of thirty to 45-minute delays, a rare accomplishment indeed, that made the clock insignificant.?
?
Was there a dearth of English medium science teachers in the country during 1950s and 60s? Like Visakha, quite a few semi-government/Board managed schools employed South Indian Madras or Keralyte Science graduates
?
The gracious lady, Mrs. Dias, a well-known philanthropist, who together with her husband lavishly helped my Alma Mater too in Panadura. Mrs Dias initiated a tradition with the schools she attended. Even her great-grand children have been students at Sri Sumangala College and Girl?s School.? ?
?A natural curiosity that cropped up after reading the Sunday Times? write-up on the Annual Pulimood Oration, hauled the writer to the girl?s school at Vajira Road to be greeted by a ?circle? of young misses- exquisitely clad in gold & blue sarees- and young past pupils who were extremely courteous at the entrance to the auditorium. The respect and care extended towards the elderly were admirable. These kind acts brought back memories of the smart school prefect, who directed me to the Registrar?s office, when I reported on my first day at Visakha 51 years ago. This was during their golden jubilee celebrations.? ?
Going further back to early1960s, to the time of the Advanced Level class at Sri Sumangala College, our Botany teacher was Mr Chandirasekhari, an Indian. He frequently suggested referring to Pullimood and Joshua for more details. ?A Text Book of Botany? by Pulimood and Joshua, though happened to be the standard Botany text that firmly established as English medium bio-science students? ?encyclopedia? on flora which the Education Department recommended to the OL curriculum. Pulimood & Joshua became a useful text even at higher tertiary levels for all Botany lovers who used it as a precious reference book.? ?
?
Dearth of teachers?
Was there a dearth of English medium science teachers in the country during 1950s and 60s? Like Visakha, quite a few semi-government/Board managed schools employed South Indian Madras or Keralyte Science graduates. It was Kailasapathy and Siva Alexander, the two outstanding teachers who taught Chemistry and Zoology respectively at the A Level classes in college. While discussing a plant in its botanical name, some ??bergia grandiflora? a species more akin to Indian soil as given in ?a text book of botany? by Pulimood, I refreshed my memory travelling back in time to the days when we nick-named our lady botany teacher at the OL class, ??grandiflora?, [the blue sky-flower] for the beautiful lady always dressed in bluish attire, perhaps her favourite colour. Among tens of thousands greens on this wonderland called planet Earth as scripted by Ms Pullimood and Anna K. Joshua, her bellowed sister who co-authored the text, our land is inundated with exotic ?grandifloras?. Isn?t two sisters co-authoring a science text something unique? Over to you, undergrads of Library Science, this is a? research topic for a project!? ?
?It is indeed amazingly inspiring to learn that Visakha continues without a break, dedicating a day to remember the former principal of the school.? The birthday of this respected lady falls on July 23. The Pulimood Era heralds the ?Golden Age? of Visakha. She undoubtedly had an extremely successful career as a farsighted educationist; perhaps more importantly as a much-loved teacher and principal. In modern societies gratitude and other intrinsic values are often concealed and suppressed, and are obscured by other concerns.? ?

Another distinguished old Visakhian, a linguist and a literati?s first appointment was with Sri Sumangala. I had the good fortune to be her pupil. Young Miss Sita Wickramaarachchi commenced a short stint as our class teacher during the O? Lvel First year for six months in 1961. When she ended this period she had become Mrs Sita Kulatunga. She invited the entire class to her wedding held at her hometown in Bandaragama. Some of us continued the teacher-pupil relationship with her in the decades that followed, though not so strong as the Pullimood-Visakhian bond. Mrs Kulathunga, the well-known writer, who authored the short novel ?Dari, the third wife??the story of a beautiful young girl from Northern Nigeria who was forced to abandon schooling to please her parents and enter into a polygamous matrimony with an older man. In the story the lady ultimately finds it hard to come to terms in the company of two ?senior? wives of the husband. She wrote it based on her familiarity with Nigerian culture where for two years she taught English. Mrs Sita Kulathunga invited the writer for the Susan George Pullimood Oration which she delivered on July 23 either in 2007 or 2008 at Visakha under the theme, ?Creative Writer?s role which he begged to be excused of. A few years before her untimely death the writer was fascinated when a Sunday newspaper carried on the same page articles by the teacher and her pupil [the writer].? ?
?
Alavaka yakkha
Reflecting on Alavaka yakkha, who ordered, ?Get out, you recluse!? as The Buddha entered his abode, and later threatened him with, ?I will ask you a question, recluse. If you do not answer me, I will confound your thoughts, or cleave your heart, or take you by your feet and fling you over to the further shore of the ocean?, two of us approached the lady in-charge of the Hostel knowing well that we would be subjected to a series of questions, and memorizing the answer to the fourteenth by Alavaka, Pa??aya Parisujjhati, the Visakhian?s motto now familiar with us after learning it from Registrar Mr Ranasinghe and his assistant my name sake Mr Perera. We have just completed two weeks within the walls of the feminine charm when we entered her office to be greeted by the pleasant lady.? ?
It all happened with our supervisor deciding to keep away without intimation, and we were ?left in the lurch ..? not knowing what work to attend to. My colleague did not waste time though; he glanced through the pages of Audit-Programme/Schedule to end up on a folio that revitalised us and put some spark into kick-start the day.
Check inventory at Dormitories! It said..? ?
?Ten thousand thundering typhoons!? Yelled my Captain Archibald Haddock fan, and Royalist colleague who retired a few years ago as Director Finance in a conglomerate.? ?
?In the previous years they didn?t go there?? Mr Ranasinghe, the middle-aged Registrar who on an earlier occasion remarked about ?distractions? during intervals, queries.? ?
?Just to say thank you to the lady who provides us with sumptuous lunch? I quipped.? ?
?I understand my dear fellow?? ?
?Let me first alert the girls who are on sick list? the Matron proceeded leaving us at the door.? ?
Back in Mr Ranasinghe?s office after an hour or so, within which time our head office had called to give instructions, had repeated the call ten minutes later leaving a message instead, ?RETURN TO OFFICE IMMEDIATELY?.? ?
Leaving all the pretty floras, Saraca Indicas, Althea roseas, Sweitenia mahogi and Rosa Rosaceaes of the great lady Susan George Pullimood behind we bade good bye to Mr Ranasinghe and his staff, with all emotions reduced to fear, worry and speculation, but not forgetting to clasp our hands and bow down at Vajiraramaya as we walked past Vajira Road 51 years ago.

SAITM Scholarship: Students seek Presidential intervention
	
The SAITM Student Action Committee (SSAC) yesterday sought the immediate intervention of President Maithripala Sirisena with regard to the cancellation of students? scholarships granted by the SAITM.
While thanking the President for the decision he took to absorb SAITM students to the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (KDU), the students had also sought the President?s attention over the higher course fees asked by the KDU.
In a letter to the President, the students had stated the they were informed by the KDU that all scholarships granted by the SAITM institute had been cancelled and they have to pay Rs. 1.3 million as annual course fee.
The students said they were depressed with the 9-year long SAITM controversy and were happy with the President?s decision to absorb the students to the KDU however again were discouraged with this latest issue as the KDU rejected registering those who failed to pay before Monday (6).
The students said they have now facing a worst situation than then, as it was impossible to find such money without settling the loans already obtained to receive SAITM education.
They have stated in their letter that they had to sell or mortgage their land or any other valuables to receive education at the SAITM.
?We were surprised when they rejected us who were having remarkable examination results. We kept hopes for years and received our education at SAITM on scholarship basis as we had financial difficulties. We kindly request the President to intervene on the matter and serve us justice,? the students said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Sri Lanka hosts Asian Law Students? Forum
	
Organisers are seen making preparations to host The Asian Law Students? Forum
?
The Asian Law Students? Forum is a major event in the calendar of the Asian Law Student?s Association (ALSA). This year the forum will be held from August 5-11. ALSA enjoys the privilege of hosting the forum in Sri Lanka for the first time. As many as 200 law students from Asia are expected to attend the forum. The forum will also include the ALSA General Assembly, Governing Council Meetings and International Board elections. In addition, various talks and table discussion have been scheduled by the organisers in line with the overarching theme for the conference and various non-academic activities to build a strong sense of fellowship.? ?
?Shamal Fernando, Deputy Executive Director (Non Academic) ALSA Forum 2018 and President ALSA-SL, further elaborated on the significance of the forum. ?The ALSA Forum is the flagship activity of the association, which is a week-long conference that brings together law students from its member countries for a series of academic and non-academic activities. The primary objective of the ALSA Forum is to bring law students from all over Asia onto one platform to form a strong network and make connections with each other and among the locals. The significance of hosting the forum in Sri Lanka is that the country is now in its peak of development and tourism has spiked and the country is booming with opportunities to grow and prosper. The ALSA SL is a sphere for all local law undergraduates to explore ones possibilities and future opportunities.?? ?
?
The forum will also include the ALSA General Assembly, Governing Council Meetings and International Board elections. In addition, various talks and table discussion have been scheduled
?
Joshua Surendraraj Media Director ALSA Forum 2018 said , ?We?ve been having this forum since 2004. The primary objective is to appoint the governing board for the Asian law students body for the coming year. We?ll be hosting both academic sessions and the general assembly where there will be voting process. We?ll have to elect the international board and produce an accountability report. The main goal is to build connections with local law students and the Asian law students.?? ?
He also spoke about the significance of hosting the forum for the first time in Sri Lanka, ?We have hosted the ALSA Annual Conference of 2015 and AIMCC 2016 (ALSA International Moot Court Competition). But hosting the ALSA forum is a huge privilege because it is the biggest event in the ALSA calendar. It was only last year that we won the bid to host the forum. The ALSA body is a growing body in Sri Lanka and we started off under the patronage of C.G Weeramanthry, former president of the International Court of Justice. This is almost a student version of CHOGM.?? ?
Navindu Mendis Director of Graphic Designing further stated, ?ALSA is a very large organisation and having a small nation like Sri Lanka hosting a forum of this calibre is a huge leap forward for us law students and the nation as a whole. I believe that the two sessions, academic and non-academic are of great importance. During the academic sessions ideas and perceptions of the law can be exchanged and the non-academic sessions would act as a cross cultural exchange where fellowship between nations would be built.?? ?

UGC raises awareness on ragging in State universities
	
The University Grants Commission (UGC) is carrying out a series of advertising campaigns in national newspapers to make students and parents aware of possible methods to mitigate ragging and violence in State universities, sources said.
The UGC in a newspaper advertisement on Thursday said it treated all students enrolled in State universities and other higher educational institutes on equal level as guaranteed by the Constitution.
It also said no student should cause any inhumane treatment, mental torture, physical or sexual violence or humiliation to another student on personal integrity. It said the Prohibition of Ragging and other forms of Violence in Educational Act prohibited such behaviour.
?Anyone found guilty of such offences will be non-bailable and can be punished by court with rigorous imprisonment up to ten years followed by permanent expulsion from the university. The UGC hotline 0112123700 is open 24-hours for students to inform the authorities of such incidents. This is also possible via the newly-launched mobile application for university students. There is a special centre established at the UGC to look into such matters. All parents are advised to be vigilant on the behaviour of their children,? it said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Burqa-clad suicide bombers kill at least 29 inside Afghan Shiite mosque
	
?
Burqa-clad suicide bombers struck a Shiite mosque in eastern Afghanistan Friday as it was crowded with worshippers for weekly prayers, killing at least 29 people and wounding more than 80 in the latest attack on the minority.? ?
Officials said they feared the death toll could rise after the assault, the latest targeting civilians who have borne the brunt of the violence in Afghanistan?s long conflict.? ?
??Two suicide explosions occurred during Friday prayers in the Khwaja Hasan area of Gardez,? said Abdullah Hasrat, spokesman for Paktia province near the Pakistan border.? ?
He told AFP the toll had risen to 29 killed and 81 wounded, with children among the victims.? ?
The bombers wore ?women?s clothing?, he said, and shot first at the mosque?s security guards before opening fire on worshippers then detonating their explosives.? ?
Local resident Sayed Naimatullah said he could hear the blasts from inside his home and rushed to the mosque.?There were body parts, heads, limbs and arms scattered everywhere. The blood of the worshippers had painted the walls of the mosque... There were pieces of glass scattered all over,? the 30-year-old told AFP.? ?
Afghan civilians have taken the brunt of the gruesome war that began after the 2001 US-led invasion uprooted the Taliban regime.? ? A total of 1,692 civilians were killed, the highest number for the period since the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan began keeping records in 2009.

Can Imran Khan end Pakistan?s war like hostility towards India?
	
Imran Khan
?
I haven?t played cricket with Imran Khan, the newly elected prime minister of Pakistan, but I did interview him back in 2005 when only a rare foreign journalist was interested in him despite his fame as having been the world?s best cricketer. Now he has won a handsome political victory.??
We did talk about Kashmir, the number one foreign policy issue then and today. He didn?t think the Indian government of that time, when Manmohan Singh was prime minister, was strong enough to make a deal. On the Pakistani side he didn?t think an army man could do it despite the army?s large influence on politics. He went on to say, ?A civilian prime minister could do it if a real leader emerged like Zulfikar Ali Bhutto? (who was prime minister in the 1960s). Maybe he meant himself.??
The issue of Kashmir has dominated Pakistani and Indian foreign policy ever since colonial India was partitioned into predominantly Hindu India and Moslem Pakistan in 1947. The British left Kashmir with a majority Muslim population and a Hindu ruler. Both Pakistan and India claimed this beautiful piece of Himalayan real estate.?
?
America could have used the muscle that the nuclear deal gave it to help push India to sign on to Musharraf?s magnanimous offer
?
The conflict has led to three wars with President Bill Clinton saying he was worried the next clash might lead to nuclear war.??
India missed its great opportunity to settle the burning dispute while the military president, Pervez Musharraf, who ruled Pakistan from 2001 until his overthrow in 2008, was in power.??
According to diplomats I talked to, both British and American, in New Delhi and Islamabad, a deal was tantalisingly close. One British ambassador told me that the main barrier to a deal was ?psychological? and that India had to make very few concessions to make a final deal.??
If Musharraf wasn?t prepared to give away the store, the Pakistani compromises came close to it. But India, despite the seemingly friendly diplomacy of Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee and the un-warlike prime minister, Manmohan Singh, couldn?t bring itself to go the extra mile.??
Observers had different explanations for the Indian intransigence- that the Indian army, the intelligence services and senior bureaucrats in the foreign ministry were resisting an accord; that the leadership had not made an effort to educate the electorate as Pakistan?s had done; that the prime minister was weak and over preoccupied with the economy; that his (highly successful) attempt to lower the grinding poverty in the rural areas was also a preoccupation; that the time consuming nuclear deal with the U.S was critically important; and that India rather liked the status quo, since stubbornness fitted in with its self-image of being the sub continent?s super power. There was also the failure of the George W. Bush Administration that was, in Singh?s words, ?loved? by India for pushing a deal through Congress that lifted the long standing embargo on selling nuclear materials and reactors to India. America could have used the muscle that the nuclear deal gave it to help push India to sign on to Musharraf?s magnanimous offer.??
After his re-election Prime Minister Singh unexpectedly found himself riding high. Not only did Congress win hands down, but the grumbling that Singh was a weak prime minister had disappeared. But Singh still wouldn?t bite the bullet. As he had said to me eighteen months before, ?How can you expect me to push a peace deal when militants are coming from Pakistan every few months to set off bombs in India.? Needless to say, the big bombing in Bombay in 2010 reinforced his argument. But when I repeated this in my interview with Musharraf, he responded sharply. ?I don?t agree with his way of looking at it. If everyone in the world looked for calm and peace before reaching a solution, we would never achieve peace anywhere. It is the political deal itself that can produce calm. Bomb blasts are a result of the problem. Let?s not put the cart before the horse.?? ?Musharraf had his own good reasons for compromising. The conflict has led to Pakistan-based guerrillas fighting for a free Kashmir, (which Pakistan?s intelligence service has long secretly supported, although much less these days). But these militants have given aid, men and advice to the Taliban in Afghanistan. In turn the Afghani Taliban have helped the Pakistani Taliban, although they have not gone along with the attacks made by factions of Pakistan?s Taliban- such as when they tried to kill Musharraf, did kill Benazir Bhutto as she campaigned to be prime minister and when they have blown up schools and clinics. Settling Kashmir could have been and would be still a major contribution towards taming the Pakistani Taliban.??
Is Imran Khan the civilian leader who could do the job of making peace with India? Could he carry the army with him? Can he neutralise the Pakistani Taliban? Is India ready this time if he does? We wait and we will see.??

Cinematic politics Of Dravidian Patriarch ?Kalaignar? Karunanidhi
	
?
By
D.B.S. Jeyaraj?
Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena reportedly sent two special representatives early this week to India with a letter to the ailing Dravidian Tamil political patriarch Muttuvel Karunanidhi wishing him a speedy recovery. Karunanidhi known widely as ?Kalaignar?(artiste) has been leader of the Dravida Munnera Kazhagham (Dravidian Progressive Federation) since 1969 and served as chief minister of India?s Tamil Nadu state for a total of 19 years. The nonagenarian ?Kalaignar? Karunanidhi who celebrated his 94th birthday on June 3rd has held office as Tamil Nadu chief minister five times from 1969 -71, 1971-76, 1989 -91,1996-2001 and 2006-11.? ?
Karunanidhi was admitted to the Kauvery hospital in Chennai last week due to a urinary tract infection and steep decline in blood pressure. He also underwent some tracheotomy procedural changes to help him in breathing.The latest medical bulletin issued by the hospital stated that Karunanidhi?s vital signs have gradually normalised, but he would continue to be hospitalised due to the overall decline in his general health given his age (94). Karunanidhi?s health has been on the decline since 2016. The silver tongued orator renowned for his powerful speeches over the years has been ?silenced? due to a speech impairment. His movements too are restricted and has to be pushed around in a wheel chair. Still he has been receiving and meeting dignitaries and also visiting the DMK part office ?Arivaalayam? (Temple of Knowledge) from time to time. Karunanidhi still remains the Party leader, a post he has held for more than 49 years. While Karunanidhi remains as ?De Jure? DMK leader, his son M.K. Stalin functions as ?De-Facto? DMK leader and heir apparent in his capacity as ?Seyal Thalaiver? or working leader.?

			A unique feature of the relationship between the movie stars of the Indian south and their fans was the proliferation of fan clubs. M.G. Ramachandran probably encouraged the phenomenon of fan clubs from late 1940s onwards, and the clubs ended up as a well-knit federation that counted its membership in the millions
			
		Indian news reports said that former Sri Lankan Cabinet minister and Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC) Parliamentarian Arumugan Thondaman along with CWC stalwart and Uva Provincial minister Senthil Thondaman visited the Kauvery hospital at Aalwaarpaettai in the Tamil Nadu capital of Chennai where Karunanidhi is currently recuperating. After visiting Kauvery hospital Arumugan and Senthil Thondaman also called on M.K. Stalin the son and political heir of Karunanidhi who is the ?Seyal Thalaiver? (working leader)of the DMK and handed over the ?get well soon? letter sent by Maithripala Sirisena.The Indian media described the two Thondamans as special emissaries of the Sri Lankan president.? ?
?
Meanwhile thousands of DMK members and supporters from all over Tamil Nadu have flocked to the hospital premises mounting vigil over their leaders health.They keep chanting ?Neendu Vaazhha Thalaivar? (live long leader) and ?Meendu Vaa Thalaiva,? (come back leader). There have been widespread outpourings of grief in the state and despite the ?atheist/agnostic/rationalist? ethos of the Dravidian movement, special poojas seeking the blessings of the almighty have been conducted in different places of worship. A very large number of Indian political leaders including Indian Vice-president Venkiah Naidu, Defence Minister Nirmala Sitaraman and Congress party chief Rahul Gandhi have visited Kauvery hospital. Many others including Prime Minister Narendra Mody keep inquiring about the DMK leader?s physical condition. Many eminent personalities issue statements and tweets expressing concern over Karunanidhi?s health. In Tamil Nadu despite deep political differences there is a genuine consensus of concern over the DMK patriarch?s health.?
?
India?s Elder Statesman?
Whatever may be his faults and foibles in his colourful yet chequered political past, Muttuvel Karunanidhi is no ordinary politico but a veritable political institution. Although the patriarch of Dravidian politics in Tamil Nadu state, the veteran politician Karunanidhi is arguably India?s elder statesman. He was first elected to the State legislative assembly in 1957 and has not lost an election since. No Indian politician can boast of such an unbroken record. He has been at the helm of the DMK for 49 years leading the party through thick and thin. He was dismissed as state chief minister twice by the central Government of India. His party was defeated several times at the polls. On one occasion Karunanidhi was the sole victor from his party at Assembly polls. In spite of all these setbacks the indefatigable Karunanidhi has always bounced back. His ardent supporters would fervently hope that their leader would once again ?return? this time too.? ?
Karunanidhi was born on June 3rd 1924 in the village of Thirukkuvalai now in the Thiruvaaroor district of Tamil Nadu. His parents Muttuvel and Anjugam were of Isai Vailalar stock. The Isai Vailalar community has been historically a talented artistic community. Some of India?s greats in the spheres of music, dance, drama and cinema hail from this caste group. Karunanidhi?s given name at birth was Daksinamoorthy. He later changed the ?sanskritized? Dakshinamoorthy to the more Tamil sounding Karunanidhi. His foray into active politics was in 1938 when he participated in an anti-Hindi agitation at the age of 14. He formed a student political organization while a high school student and started the journal ?Murasoli?(drum beat) which still remains as the DMK flagship newspaper.? ?
Karunanidhi quit secondary school studies and became a political activist while working freelance in newspapers and contributing articles. He also became a stage actor and playwright. Later he ventured into films as a script writer. This brought him much recognition and more remuneration which helped him greatly to carve out a name for himself as a politician. He was a versatile, multi-talented writer and stage actor. It was the well-known actor M.R. Radha who bestowed upon him the title ?Kalaignar?(artiste) when the drama ?Thookumaedai?(Gallows) was staged for the 100th time. Karunanidhi wrote and acted in the play.? ?
?Kalaignar? Karunanidhi developed a writing style for cinema that was flowery and alliterative (adukku Mozhi), and soon became very popular. Court room scenes, inquiries in royal courts in historical movies and short dramas introduced into films that had a modern setting, provided ample scope for Karunanidhi?s captivating prose. His reputation had producers advertising their movies by proclaiming, ?Story and Dialogue by ?Kalaignar Mu. Karunanidhi?. When film titles were projected in the cinema halls, his name would be shown ahead of the stars and greeted with applause. There were others to follow Karunanidhi in both content and style from the DMK camp ? Aasaithamby, Krishnaswamy, Maaran and Kannadasan etc. But Karunanidhi was the master in that genre surpassing even his mentor and leader Annadurai.? ?
?
Screenplay and Dialogues?
Karunanidhi has written the screenplay and dialogues for over 60 films. The first two films he wrote scripts for were ?Rajakumari? and ?Abhimanyu?. However Karunanidhi was not credited for those films. It was his third film ?Marutha Naattu Ilavarasi? released in 1950 for which Karunanidhi was first credited as script writer in the titles. Among the films scripted by Karunanidhi are Manthiri Kumari, Parasakthy, Manamahal, Panam, Manohara, Thirumbi paar, Malaikkallan, Pudumaippithan, Kuravanji, Raja Rani,Arasilankumari, Iruvar Ullam, Rangoon Radha, Pudaiyal, Kaanchi Thalaivan, Poom buhaar, Poomaalai, Avan Pithanaa, Marakka Mudiyumaa, Pillaiyo Pillai, Paalaivana Rojakkal, Uliyin Oasai and Ponnar Shankar. It is said that he received 3000 rupees for his first film. However in later years he got up to 75 lakhs of rupees to script a film.?
?
Muttuvel Karunanidhi is no ordinary politico but a veritable political institution. Although the patriarch of Dravidian politics in Tamil Nadu state, the veteran politician Karunanidhi is arguably India?s elder statesman
Kalaignar also formed a film company called Mekala Pictures in partnership with others and produced several films. Later his nephew and former Indian Cabinet minister ?Murasoli? M.K. Maaran took over the company. In addition to being a script writer and playwright, Karunanidhi has also written film songs. He is also a reputed writer having written many novels and short stories. He is also well-known for explaining classical Tamil literature in elegant yet simple prose. Two of his outstanding works are ?Kuraloaviyam? and ?Sangath Thamizh?. He has also written a four-part auto-biography named ?Nenjukku Neethi?.?
Interestingly Karunanidhi?s family has had and continues to maintain close links with the Tamil film industry. Apart from Karunanidhi, his nephew and former cabinet minister M.K. Maran - who is no more - was also a former film script writer. Maran?s brother Amirtham was a cinematographer. Maran?s sons Kalanidhi and Dayanidhi are co-owners of the ?Sun? group TV network. They also produce films under the banner ?Sun Pictures?. Karunanidhi?s son and heir apparent M.K. Stalin too has dabbled in acting, as the hero of a TV serial ?Kurinji Malar?. Stalin?s son Udhayanidhi is both a successful film producer as well as actor who has played the hero in many Tamil films. His wife Kiruthiga directs films. Karunanidhi?s younger son Thamizharasu?s son, Arulnidhi, has made his mark as lead actor in some films. His elder son Azhaghiri?s son Dayanidhi is a film producer and distributor. Karunanidhi?s eldest son M.K. Muthu also had a short lived film career as an actor-singer. Moreover the DMK chief?s ?second wife? Rajathi was also a stage actress who got involved with Karunanidhi as his ?Thunaivi? when acting in dramas penned by Kalaignar. Their daughter Kanimozhi who is a Rajya Sabha MP is the owner of ?Kalaignar TV?. If cinema and politcs are inter-twined in Tamil Nadu then Karunanithi?s family seems to be immersed in both.? ?
?
Karunanidhi - Sivaji Ganesan Combo?
The Dravidian movement also spawned a school of actors who could effectively mouth the lines written by script writers of their ilk.. One of the early greats was the comedian N.S. Krishnan, known as Kalaivaanar, who made the audience both laugh and think. Krishnan was followed by a host of ?Dravidian School? actors like K.R. Ramaswamy, M.R. Radha, T.V. Narayanaswamy, S.S. Rajendran (SSR) and Sivaji Ganesan. The last two in particular were able to deliver the powerful prose of Karunanidhi with great conviction and style. The Karunanidhi- Sivaji Ganesan combo was a great success.? ?
The big break in Sivaji?s career came in 1952, when he acted as the hero in ?Parasakthi,? a film directed by Krishnan-Panju. The dialogue, written by M. Karunanidhi in fiery and flowery prose with a surfeit of alliterations, the hallmark of Karunanidhi?s style, came powerfully alive in a stunning performance by Sivaji, unparalleled in Tamil cinema. The monologue uttered as an address to Tamil Nadu in the earlier scenes and the courthouse speech in the closing stages of the film were classic instances of delightful oratory. The Karunanidhi-Sivaji combination made an explosive impact. The writer?s rich prose, brimming with vitality, was given emotive and impressive expression by the actor. Every film in which they collaborated was a success. Notable among them were Thirumbi Paar, Manohara, Kuravanji and Iruvar Ullam.?
Sivaji had an extraordinary flair for dialogue delivery. He pioneered an exquisite style, diction, tone and tenor.Soon personal differences arose between Sivaji Ganesan and Karunanidhi, and the actor crossed over to the Congress party . To make up for Ganesan, Karunanidhi, whose dialogues were increasingly getting political, weaned an actor from the Congress camp into the DMK fold. This was M.G. Ramachandran, until then a popular hero playing?
swashbuckling action roles.? ?
A unique feature of the relationship between the movie stars of the Indian south and their fans was the proliferation of fan clubs. M.G. Ramachandran probably encouraged the phenomenon of fan clubs from late 1940s onwards, and the clubs ended up as a well-knit federation that counted its membership in millions. The clubs held annual conventions and also participated in social service projects. When MGR entered active politics, his fan clubs were in turn politicised and soon became an indispensable component of the DMK propaganda machine.? ?
?
Popularity of MGR?within DMK?
The popularity of MGR within the party and state caused major convulsions. In a bid to counteract the phenomenon, Karunanidhi encouraged his eldest son M.K. Muthu to enter movies. The father, while in office as chief minister, wrote the story and dialogue for Muthu?s first film Pillaiyo Pillai (Oh, What a Son). Muthu Fan clubs were set up overnight, with father Karunanidhi?s backing. MGR, realising what was in store, engineered a split within the party in 1972 on the grounds of corruption charges against the incumbent regime. Incidentally, MGR did not have any problems in setting up new party structures ?he merely converted his fan clubs into party branches. In 1977 the MGR led AIADMK defeated the Karunanidhi led DMK. The bitter irony was that MGR had been brought into DMK politics by Karunanidhi and Karunanidhi had been helped to succeed Annadurai as chief minister in?
1969 by MGR himself.? ?
Although Karunanidhi is known nowadays as a political leader(and rightly so) there is no denying that it was his association with films that gave him the necessary popularity with the masses of Tamil Nadu. This is due to the peculiar course of politics in Tamil Nadu where the influence of cinema on politics has been of a phenomenal nature. Popular film personalities have enjoyed great support among the masses. Unlike in North India, Tamil Nadu film personalities served as an integral component of their parties. In most cases, they were the ?axles? around whom their party wheel revolved. Significantly, from 1967, most chief ministers in Tamil Nadu have had connections to the silver screen - Annadurai,Karunanidhi, M.G.Ramachandran, Janaki Ramachandran and Jayalalithaa Jayaram. The exceptions have been the current chief minister Edappaadi Palaniswamy and earlier O. Panneerselvam nominated as ?caretaker? CM on three occasions.? ?
With a population of more than 70 million, Tamil Nadu has the third highest literacy rate among the states of India. The state is also home to India?s original rationalist movement, started by E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker (Periyar). Known as the Suyamariyaathai lyakkam, or self-respect movement, it promoted healthy political protest against caste oppression, the imposition of Hindi as national language and superstition in religion. Periyar also founded the Dravida Kazhagham or Dravidian Party in 1943, to which both today?s ruling party All-India Ann-Dravida Munnetra Kazhagham(AIADMK) and chief opposition Dravida Munnetra Kazhagham(DMK) trace their lineage. In spite of this ?Dravidian? heritage of rationalism and self-respect, it is Tamil Nadu that has allowed film stars to exercise political hegemony like no other. How this situation came about is a bizarrely unique story.? ?
?
Struggle for Indian independence?
The involvement of popular artistes in Indian politics dates back to the struggle for Indian independence. Back then it was more a case of singers, musicians and drama artistes involving themselves at a provincial level, where explicit and implicit messages extolling the virtues of Mahatma Gandhi and independence were conveyed to the audience. Social reform was also advocated. Congress party leader Sathiyamurthy was one who recognised the political potential of actors and singers and began utilising their services in the Tamil speaking areas of the former Madras presidency. The singer-actor K.B. Sundarambal and the TKS Brothers Drama troupe being glittering examples in this sphere.? ?
The message of Swarajya was projected through song recitals, street dramas, folk theatre, stage plays and later through silent and ?talkie?films. Logic gave way to patriotism in many instances. For example the mythological film ?Sathi Anasuya? had women of the Puranic era weave ?Khadar? on the hand loom in keeping with Mahatma Gandhi?s tenets. As the film industry bloomed, some films were perceived by the erstwhile British rulers as possessing seditious content. The authorities clamped down on some ?objectionable? films, a notable example being the Tamil film Thyaga Bhoomi (Land of Sacrifice) made in -1938. It was written originally for the screen by ?Kalki? Krishnamurthy and serialised in the Tamil journal Ananda Vikatan. The film directed by K. Subramaniam spoke eloquently against oppression of women as well as against British rule.? ?

Ramaswamy Naicker (Periyar). Known as the Suyamariyaathai lyakkam, or self-respect movement, it promoted healthy political protest against caste oppression, the imposition of Hindi as national language and superstition in religion
?
?The advent of Independence and the early post-Independence years saw cinema and politics take different directions in North India. Though there was some political content in certain movies, there was no overt politicisation. Likewise, a few movie stars did get involved in politics but never played a pivotal role. In recent times many actors north of the Vindhyas have been involved in election campaigns. Several have been elected MP?s with a few becoming ministers too. To generalise, Northern film stars are essentially ?ornaments? for the respective political parties and not decision makers wielding real power.
?However, in South India, and particularly in Tamil Nadu, politics and cinema have been inextricably intertwined in a big way. The larger-than-life images of actors like N.S. Krishnan, M.G.
Ramachandran, Sivaji Ganesan, S.S. Rajendran, N.T. Rama Rao and Jayalalitha, dominated the political scene. As stated earlier political leaders like former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi and his mentor and predecessor C.N. Annadurai also came in from careers in cinema, as screenplay and dialogue writers.? ?
?
Dravidian consciousness and ideology?
The role of cinema in the political history of Tamil Nadu provides interesting insights into present-day developments. The politics of Tamil Nadu for the past 75 years has been pervaded by notions of the Aryan-Dravidian divide. This concept itself is not very scientific and has been greatly mythologised. Nevertheless, this Dravidian consciousness and ideology has helped politicise significant sections of the Tamil masses and has sustained whole political parties and movements.? ?
?According to its proponents, the original inhabitants of India were the Dravidians and it was the invading Aryans who took over the north and pushed the Dravidians southward. In addition, the Aryans also imposed their caste structure on the Dravidians, who had until then a classless society. This hierarchy placed the Brahmins on top. Dravidian ideologues maintained that Tamil Brahmins were not Tamil even though they spoke the language, but were alien Aryan relics. While its social reform platform was quite progressive, the Dravidian movement?s crude version of the Aryan-Dravidian interface and its venomous antipathy towards Tamil Brahmins left much to be desired.?
?Socio-historical reasons had enabled the Brahmins to remain the ruling elite in the state. They were better educated and dominated most fields, including the professions. In addition there was the stamp of authority provided by orthodox Hinduism. The emerging non-Brahmin elites chose to adopt the Dravidian ideology to overthrow what they saw as Brahminic hegemony. The clearly perceived position of power that the numerically inferior Brahmins enjoyed, made them vulnerable targets. The democratic process made easy the mobilisation of non-Brahmin caste groups on the basis of the Dravidian ideology.? ?
Dravidian languages are 19 in all, of which Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Tulu and Kannada are the most prominent. Interestingly, there were few takers for the ?Dravidian? ideology among the other South Indian states of Andhra Pradesh (Telugu), Kerala (Malayalam) and Karnataka (Kannada). However, it took firm root in Tamil Nadu. The original political demand of the Dravidian parties was a Dravidian state comprising present-day Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Pondicherry, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. It later modified itself into a secessionist movement, focused on Tamil Nadu alone. It was only after the 1962 war with China that the DMK dropped its separatist demand in the interests of national unity and security. It now agitates for greater autonomy within the Indian union.? ?
?
Dravida Munnetra Kazhagham (DMK)?
The DMK was born in post-independence India. Karunanidhi?s ascendancy in politics basically corresponded with that of the DMK?s rise in Tamil Nadu. The parent Dravidian movement of the DMK was the Dravida Kazhagham (DK) founded by E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker known as ?periyaar? (great person) opposed to participation in politics. It was also very much under his autocratic control. A group of dissidents, including Karunanidhi, revolted under the leadership of Conjeevaram Natarajan Annadurai and formed the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagham (DMK) in 1949. Starting out as a social reform movement, the DMK later decided that change was impossible without capturing political power through democratic means.? ?
?In 1957, the DMK decided to enter electoral politics and secured 15 seats in the state assembly and two in Parliament. In 1962, the figure went up to 50 in the state assembly and eight in Parliament. 1967 saw it capture power for the first time when it got 138 out of the 234 seats in the state. The DMK also won all the seats (25) it contested for the Lok Sabha. Annadurai became chief minister. He changed the name of the State from the previous Madras to the present Tamil Nadu (Tamil Country/Land). Annadurai died in 1969. He was succeeded by Karunanidhi who was earlier the Public Works Minister. In 1971, the party registered a landslide victory when it captured 184 seats in the state and 23 in Parliament. The party seemed invincible.? ?
?But 1972 saw a major split. The DMK?s chief vote gatherer and matinee idol Maruthoor Gopalamenon Ramachandran, or MGR, broke away from the party and floated his own that year. He named it after Annadurai and called it Anna DMK. It was later changed to All India Anna-DMK. MGR?s party won three elections in succession, securing 125 seats in 1977, 130 in 1980 and 125 in 1984. Karunanidhi had to remain content as opposition leader for 11 years. When MGR died in 1987 December, his wife Janaki succeeded him. But the government fell after one month due to Congress machinations. With MGR?s leading lady and then propaganda secretary Jayalalitha also staking her claim to party leadership, a split resulted. In 1989, a divided ADMK contested as two factions led by Janaki and Jayalalitha. The Janaki faction (one seat) was trounced by Jayalalitha (24 seats) but the DMK under Karunanidhi romped home the winner.? ?
?
Karunanidhi?s political life is over
After Rajiv Gandhi?s death, the Jayalalitha-Congress combine routed the DMK in 1991. Only its leader, Karunanidhi, managed to win. In 1996, the DMK was returned to power and retained it till 2001. Jayalalithaa returned to power in 2001 and was de-throned by Karunanidhi and the DMK in 2006. The wheel turned again in 2011 and Jayalalithaa became Chief Minister. She followed it up by winning again in 2016. However she fell ill and passed away in December that year. Her arch rival Karunanidhi too had begun to decline in health since 2016 and is now hospitalised. The doughty political fighter of yore may very well pull through to live for some more years. But it is certain that his political life is over.? ?
It is against this backdrop that popular actors Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan have both started political parties. The chief reason for Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan forming their own political parties at this time is because the political climate seems ripe for their entry into active politics in Tamil Nadu. The state has been ruled since 1967 by either the DMK and/or the AIADMK. Currently there seems to be a political vacuum in the state.? ?
After AIADMK supremo Jayalalithaa Jayaram passed away, her party, though still ruling the state, has fractured into four factions led by ex-Chief Minister O. S. Panneerselvam, present Chief minister Edappaadi Palaniswamy, Jayalalithaa?s ?UyirThozhi? (life friend) Sasikala Natarajan (currently in jail) who was also appointed AIADMK interim General Secretary and Jayalalithaa?s niece Deepa Jayakumar. The BJP Central Government has ?unified? the Panneerselvam-Palaniswamy factions temporarily and is manipulating the AIADMK State Government like a puppet on a string. The recent by-election at R.K. Nagar saw Sashikala?s nephew T. T. V. Dhinakaran contesting as an independent defeating both the AIADMK and DMK candidates. It?s a fragile situation for the AIADMK administration in Tamil Nadu. C.M. Palaniswamy?s days are numbered.? ?
?
Karunanidhi?s son M.K. Stalin?
The DMK is not doing well either. As is known the ailing party leader and former Chief Minister Muttuvel Karunanidhi (94), is hospitalised and virtually dysfunctional. Karunanidhi?s son M. K. Stalin has donned the leadership mantle but there are strong doubts whether he can deliver. The recent R.K. Nagar by-election was a shock to the DMK. It was expected that the DMK would win because the AIADMK votes were split among the official candidate and the dissident independent candidate. In spite of split votes, the independent candidate came first and AIADMK candidate second. DMK finished a poor third. Of course the ?cash for votes? syndrome was rampant.? ?
Attempts by smaller parties including the leftists to form a common front as a third alternative failed miserably at the 2016 polls. Casteist and parochial parties have a community vote bank but are unable to transcend those barriers. The BJP and Congress have again and again demonstrated that their national appeal does not work in Tamil land. Against that backdrop it is felt that a political leadership vacuum exists in the state. There is a need for change from 50 years of Dravidian politics. Kamal Haasan and/or Rajinikanth with their millions of fans may very well step in and become political forces to be reckoned within the state.? ?
?
Death-knell of Dravidianism?
If that happens the days of Dravidian ideology dominance in the state are numbered. It remains to be seen whether the impending demise of Dravidian patriarch Karunanidhi will sound the death-knell of Dravidianism in Tamil Nadu or not.? ?

Doctors? Strike: are they loyal to the Hippocratic Oath?
	
?
The health service began as a vocation like the priesthood. Top priority was given to the welfare and well being of patients. Medical doctors when they pass out still take the Hippocratic Oath which says in part : ?I swear to fulfill, to the best of my ability and judgment, this covenant: I will respect the hard-won scientific gains of those physicians in whose steps I walk, and gladly share such knowledge as is mine with those who are to follow. I will apply, for the benefit of the sick, all measures which are required, avoiding those twin traps of over-treatment and therapeutic nihilism. I will remember that there is art to medicine as well as science, and that warmth, sympathy, and understanding may outweigh the surgeon?s knife or the chemist?s drug.?? ?
These immortal words come to mind as we reflect on the consequences of another strike launched yesterday by the Government Medical Officer?s Association (GMOA) which often boast of being one of the biggest and most powerful trade unions in Asia. Those who suffered most because of this strike were tens of thousands of poor patients who came to public hospitals as early as 5.00 am but were turned away without treatment.? ?
Over the past few decades, especially after 1977 when Sri Lanka swallowed wholesale the globalized capitalist market economic system, the health service priorities have changed. No longer is the highest priority given to the well-being of? patients. Instead we see more and more private hospitals being set up with the wealthiest business people investing money in them because private hospitals have become one of the biggest profit making businesses. With the change of priorities the medical doctors? vocation, with some exceptions of course, became a profession and is now a profit making business. So the patients? well-being has been degraded to priority number 03 if not lower.? ?
GMOA leaders say their strike was launched on various demands ranging from their income tax payments being raised from 12% to 24% and the admission of their children to prestigious national schools, to issues connected with the free trade agreement between Sri Lanka and Singapore. But government leaders have pointed out that the income tax increase will apply only to medical doctors? earning more than Rs. 350,000 a month while for others it will remain at 12%. Government leaders also accused GMOA leaders, mainly its President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya, of indulging in party politics.? ?
Social analysts are also raising major questions on the regular strikes in the health service and other essential services. They are asking whether the government should consider a ban on strikes in essential services, because essentially those who suffer most are millions of poor, innocent and helpless people. They say that just as strikes are not allowed in the security forces, the government should consider a ban on strikes in essential services such as health, transport, postal and telecommunications.? ?
Instead, there is a better and more effective way of conflict resolution through dialogue. For this both parties need to have the dialogue with an open mind, with awareness that their view or understanding of the situation is always relative and never absolute. This paradigm shift is essential. Then the two or more parties could come to some accommodation on the hallowed middle path. This is known as synergy, where one plus one will make not two but three. That means something new or a reasonable solution on the middle path.? ?
For decades, patients? rights groups had campaigned for a national medicinal drugs policy based on the principles of Professor Senaka Bibile, widely acclaimed as a prophet of modern medicine.
Transnational drug giants or mafias had campaigned against the Bibile policy which was essentially intended to provide quality drugs to the people at affordable prices. Transnational drug mafias are reported to have given billions to politicians to prevent the implementation of the Bibile policies. The new government however implemented the Bibile policies, but much more needs to be done to restore the priority given to patients in the health service and dialogue is the best way of resolving conflicts which arise in this vision and mission.? ?

Expressway: Illegal motor racing a public inconvenience
	
Illegal motor races at night on the Southern Expressway entry road between Devata and Pinnaduwa are continuing unchecked causing much inconvenience to the people.
Residents of the area said the deafening noise emanating from motorcycles and trishaws racing along the road between 11.30 p.m. and 2.30 a.m. disturbed their sleep and their children's studies. They pointed out that a group of individuals receiving political patronage was organizing night motor races for high stakes.
The people living in houses by the roadside said they were the worst affected by the noise and that invalid elders and patients were forced to forgo sound sleep, while children attending to their studies were severely disturbed.
A senior police official said the Akmeemana and Galle police had received several complaints in this regard and legal action had been taken against several motorcyclists and trishaw drivers engaging in illegal motor races. He said motorcyclists and trishaw drivers from distant areas were taking part in the races organised through Facebook advertisements. (D.G. Sugathapala)

Govt. ignored undertaking given to SC: GK depositors
	
A group of Golden Key depositors said the government had ignored the undertaking given to the the Supreme Court in August 2015 by failing to pay the depositors within a year 41% of the funds deposited with the company.
On August 4, 2015, the court case filed by Golden Key depositors in the Supreme Court was concluded after six years, based on an undertaking given by the Central Bank Monetary Board, the Treasury Secretary, the then Finance Minister and the then Governor of the CBSL.
The undertaking was to pay:
* Within a month of the termination of the FR case a 41% of the deposits to those who had deposited less than Rs.2 million while those with deposits of more than Rs.2 million and less than Rs.10 million to be paid 41% of their deposits within two months. These two categories were repaid as stipulated.
* Those who had deposited more than Rs.10 million were to be paid 41% of their deposits within a year but this repayment was not carried out as undertaken.
The depositors claim that the CBSL had failed to make the repayments even by November 2016 though the reimbursement was undertaken to be carried out within a year from August 4, 2015.
Consequently, these depositors filed another application in the SC in November 2016 against the Monetary Board, its members, the CB Governor, the Minister of Finance and the Secretary to the Treasury alleging Contempt of Court for failing to comply with the court order.
The undertaking was given following an intervention into the ongoing fundamental rights petition, where the aggrieved depositors? money was being paid according to tSC orders, the then Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake and then Governor Arjun Mahendran, on May 18, 2015, had requested the Court to appoint an auditor to conduct a financial and a legal audit of GKCCL to formulate a repayment plan to settle the depositors.
They also sought S C approval to give a time bound repayment plan to be implemented under the CBSL and therefore to conclude the ongoing FR application.
What the Monetary Board of the Central Bank actually undertook to pay was the 41% of the deposit value after deducting payments already made on a time scale.
However, speaking to the Daily Mirror Senior Counsel Heejaz Hisbulla who appeared for the petitioners sai at that moment he had requested the Court to loo into the undertaking more deeply since the case itself was the only way that depositors could obtain a relief.
According to Mr. Hejaaz, the then Chief Justice Sripavan had also looked into whether there was an actual approval from the Cabinet to repay such amount. However, the Attorney General was of the view at that time that the undertaking was a legitimate one.
"During the hearing of the case, Attorney General?s Department assured at the Supreme Court that due amount would be paid soon. Then the repayment process started for the depositors who had deposits above Rs. 10 million at the GKCCL," Counsel Hisbulla said.
However, some of the depositors claim that some Rs.1 billion was still to be paid to the depositors by the government but not a single payment made for 13 months. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

?Teaching isn?t merely a profession; rather it?s a service to the country.? However, it?s very rare to see the? teachers being felicitated for their services. There?s no other big pleasure for teachers than to see their students become illustrious people. Teachers make a vital contribution in identifying and honing the talents of their students. These teachers are leaders and tailor-made for this task.? Teachers always inspire, empower and guide their students. As such, it?s always essential to felicitate the shepherds of our lives at least once a year.? ?
Mahanama College, one of the leading schools in Colombo, gave a great example last Sunday (July 29) with regard to honouring its teachers. This event was titled? ?Mahanamabiwandana?. At the event the founders of the school, principals, teachers and parents were? commemorated.? ?
The event, organized by the Old Boys Association (OBA) of the school, was held under the guidance of OBA Chief Executive Officer Indunil Silva. This event is a concept of one of the school?s past head prefects Kumara Galhenage? ?

Medical Ordinance: Not fulfilling primary objective- Prof. Gunaratne
	
Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) Chairman Colvin Gunaratne said yesterday even though the primary objective of the Medical Ordinance was to safeguard the rights of patients, it was catering to the needs of the doctors because of its composition.
He told a news conference that 16 out of the 25 members of the SLMC were elected from Trade Unions of doctors and asked how such a body could mete out justice to the patients.
?The Medical Ordinance is meant to safeguard the rights of the patients. But it is not fulfilling its primary objective because of its shortcomings such as its composition,? Prof. Gunaratne said
He said the struggled to introduce amendments to the ordnance for four years as a SLMC member and for nine months as the chairman of the SLMC was for no avail.
?No SLMC chairmen had attempted to amend the Medical ordinance so far. In other countries, it is changed in about four or five years. Medical ordinance in Sri Lanka has not been amended for 80 years despite some minor amendments. A fresh ordinance should be introduced instead of the present archaic ordinance,? he said.
