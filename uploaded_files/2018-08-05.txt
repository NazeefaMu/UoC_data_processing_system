Hendricks century clinches ODI series for SA
	
South Africa continued their dominance when they coasted to a convincing 78-run win as they clinched the five-match ODI series with their third successive victory over Sri Lanka played at the Pallekele Stadium in Kandy this evening.
Sri Lanka who were facing a must win situation in pursuit of a mammoth target of 364 runs never looked like making a match of it after they collapsed to 124 for five.
Despite a partnership of 95 runs for the seventh-wicket between Dhananjaya de Silva (who made a top score of 84 in just 66 balls with eight boundaries and three sixes) and Akila Dananjaya, it only delayed an inevitable win for South Africa.

KDU has no scholarship scheme: Wijeyadasa
	
Although the SAITM institute had awarded scholarships to its students they would not be entitled financial scholarships at the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (KDU), Minister of Higher Education Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said today.
?KDU has no scholarship scheme,? he told the Daily Mirror.
Minister Rajapakshe explained that the SAITM had awarded scholarships under political grounds.
?SAITM scholarships are given on political patronage, not on merit,? he said.
He also said that SAITM founder Dr Neville Fernando accepted SAITM had awarded Rs. 400 million worth scholarships under the influence of politicians.
Minister Rajapakshe said that Dr Fernando had informed him that among them there were ten students who received Rs. 10 million worth scholarship each, under the influence of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
He said the absorbing students at the KDU under the current financial ground were also agreed by SAITM parents then.
?KDU course fee is one-third of what they had to pay at the SAITM. By awarding scholarships to the students, we cannot make the KDU another SAITM. The Government had served the justice at its best to the students,? he added. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Venezuela President Maduro 'survives drone attack'
	
Venezuelan President Nicol?s Maduro says he has survived an assassination attempt involving explosive drones.
Mr Maduro was speaking at an military event in Caracas when the alleged attack occurred.
Live footage of Mr Maduro's speech shows the president suddenly looking upwards - startled - and dozens of soldiers running away.
Mr Maduro has blamed Colombia for the attack - something denied by Bogota as a "baseless" accusation.
Seven soldiers were injured, and several people were later arrested, the Venezuelan authorities said.
Two drones loaded with explosives went off near the president's stand, Communications Minister Jorge Rodriguez said.
Mr Maduro later said in a national address: "A flying object exploded near me, a big explosion. Seconds later there was a second explosion."
Photos on social media showed bodyguards protecting Mr Maduro with bulletproof shields after the alleged attack.
Mr Maduro accused neighbouring Colombia and elements within the US of instigating "a right-wing plot" to kill him.
He added that he had "no doubt" Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos was "behind this attack".
The Venezuelan leader, who has previously accused the US of plotting against him, provided no evidence to back his claim.
The Colombian government has denied any involvement, saying there is "no basis" to Mr Maduro's allegations.
Meanwhile, Mr Rodriguez accused Venezuela's right-wing opposition of carrying out the attack.
"After losing the vote, they failed again," Mr Rodriguez said.
He was referring to May's presidential elections, where Mr Maduro was re-elected for another six-year term.(BBC)
