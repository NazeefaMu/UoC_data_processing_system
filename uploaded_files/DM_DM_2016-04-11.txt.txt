## Title: Asians relying on savings for unexpected events but gaps remain: HSBC survey

Asians relying on savings for unexpected events but gaps remain: HSBC survey
	
Over six in 10 Asians (64 percent) claim they hold savings and investments or insurance to help them manage financially in the wake of unforeseen events. Globally, 54 percent say they have financial plans in place, according to HSBCs new global report, The Power of Protection Confidence in the Future.
However, this does not mean individuals are well-prepared as the measures in place might be not sufficient at all. HSBC Global Head of Distribution for Insurance John Goddard said, It is important for customers to continually review their protection needs as their financial goals and the cost of achieving them change over time. Insufficient protection means one might have to use the savings set aside for other purposes to pay for expenses incurred by unexpected events, for example it could impact their ability to pay for a childs education or save for retirement.
According to Swiss Re, the mortality protection gap in Asia Pacific increased to US $ 58 trillion in 2014 from US $ 42 trillion in 2010 while the health protection gap increased to US $ 54.2 billion in 2014 from US $ 9 billion in 2011.
According to the HSBCs survey, 37 percent of working people surveyed in Taiwan (46 percent), Singapore (40 percent), Malaysia (37 percent), Hong Kong (37 percent), Indonesia (33 percent) and China (24 percent), on average, would not manage well financially or have no savings or protection to rely on should the unexpected happen.
Across respondents in Asia, 66 percent on average say that in life, they worry most about their health, followed by long-term financial security (49 percent) and quality of life (42 percent). Over a third of those who worry the most about health (33 percent) and long-term financial stability (39 percent) in Asia say they are financially unprepared if something unforeseen happens.
While health is the main concern for many, 57 percent of Asians think that someone else should be responsible for the cost of their personal healthcare: the state/government (22 percent), employer (18 percent), family (17 percent). People in China are most likely to think someone else should be responsible for funding their personal healthcare (71 percent) with 35 percent expecting this to be funded by the state.
It is important that people are aware of the limitations of protection plans offered by employers or the government as they usually cover only general needs with a basic level of protection. With their traditional saving habits and the higher economic growth prospects in Greater China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Asians are comparatively better positioned to build a personal safety net for unforeseen events, added Goddard.
In Asia, our survey found that 71 percent of those who actively plan for the future believe that their future quality of life will be very good or excellent. This drops to 41 percent for people who are not active planners.
Goddard said, We believe there is a strong link between being protected or prepared and peoples positivity about the future. A sound financial plan with insurance as the foundation should help secure your financial well-being and bring peace of mind, allowing you to look to the future with confidence.
While the majority (more than 40 percent) of those who are not prepared say they believe they cannot afford it, four in 10 in Asia, on average, say they believe there is nothing they can do to prepare for the unknown versus the global average of around 30 percent.
Misunderstanding of insurance is another common barrier. Of those who are considering health insurance but have not yet purchased it, the main barrier is cost-related; 59 percent of people in Asia say they either know or expect it to be too expensive while 43 percent say they do not know how to go about it or are concerned
about exclusions.
Goddard said, People can sometimes find insurance complex and there are often misconceptions about the costs involved, which is why they should seek financial advice from a trusted provider to help identify the right solution for them.
HSBCs research identified four actions that may help individuals to better prepare for the future:
1. Identify your biggest concerns
Review the financial protection you have in place today. See if it is enough to cover any concerns you have about providing for you and your familys lifestyle, home, health and future, if something unexpected should happen.
2. Know your future aspirations
Think about your aspirations for the future. Seeking professional advice could help you understand what protection you may need to put in place to achieve them.
3. Have an action plan
Once you understand what protection you have and what you need, explore the options available and take action to bridge the gap.
4. Review it regularly
Employer and state provision may not be sufficient for all your needs and your circumstances will change over time. Review your plan regularly so you can take corrective action early.

Beware of Indians: GMOA on Malaria fears
	
Speaking on the incident where an Indian national had been diagnosed with malaria in Nuwara Eliya, the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today warned the public to be cautious, if there were Indian nationals nearby because saying India was one of countries with worst epidemic diseases.
The GMOA doctors said in the wake of the country being prepared to gain Malaria-free certification from World Health Organization (WHO) with a zero number of local cases of Malaria since October 2012, the health authorities should stay vigilant to make no room for the epidemic to spread in the country again.
GMOA General Secretary Dr. Nalinda Herath said Sri Lanka would have to face serious health problems at this rate, with the increasing number of Indians arriving and working in the country, without undergoing necessary medical screening.
Even though we are a country with no serious diseases and maintaining a good health status in Asia, having a big country like India as the nearest country, which has reports of various epidemics is dangerous to us, the doctor said.
He also urged the Health Ministry to launch an investigation into the finding of the Malaria patient, who had been working in Sri Lanka on an expired visiting Visa.
He stressed that the Government should carry out an island wide raid to curb the foreigners, who are working in Sri Lanka on visiting Visas.
As recently as the year 2000, Sri Lanka had over 100,000 cases of Malaria. Our doctors and health officials worked hard to gain this remarkable achievement of country making free of local cases of Malaria. We should not let it to destroy it by any one. Indians have already started to work in our country even before the proposed ETCA is finalised. And as a result of that, our health status is dragging into danger slowly.
"If the ETCA is finalised, the situation will get worse. The authorities should do something to this in advance, the doctors said. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Ceylon Dollar Bond Fund records 8.82% dollar return
	
The Ceylon Dollar Bond Fund (CDBF) that invests in Sri Lanka dollar sovereign bonds and bank bonds has recorded an 8.82 percent p.a. annualized return (10.60 percent p.a. in rupee terms) during the first quarter of 2016. The only dollar-denominated fund in Sri Lanka is managed by Ceylon Asset Management while Deutsche Bank is the trustee and custodian of the fund. The fund has been awarded a B+ rating by Fitch Ratings that mirrors Sri Lankas country dollar rating.
The tax exempted unit trust is operated out of Colombo and Singapore. The fund is open to investment exclusively for Sri Lankans living or working overseas, the Board of Investment (BoI) companies and all foreign nationals and companies. The fund is open to retail investors from US $ 1,000 upwards, as well as institutional investors who can invest via Singapore or Colombo.
The open-ended fund structure enables investors easy exit whenever they please, without being locked-in for a fixed deposit. The fund has invested in dollar-denominated sovereign bonds issued by the Government of Sri Lanka and dollar bonds issued by Bank of Ceylon, National Savings Bank and DFCC Bank. Ceylon Asset Management Economic Advisor and Director Rainer Michael Preiss in Singapore said, The CDBF has been able to capitalize on high interest rates available in Sri Lankan bonds following the US Federal Reserve raising interest rates last December and Sri Lankas rating downgrade.
Commenting on the fund, Preiss went on to note that as Sri Lankas economy gains momentum, the high interest rates will decline as the countrys rating is potentially upgraded once again.
The Fed is unlikely to raise interest rates again in the near future. Therefore, investors should take advantage of the current interest rate scenario and a strong US dollar by investing in the CDBF sooner than later, he pointed out.
The returns on the Ceylon Dollar Bonds are attractive, compared to regional and international fund returns, Preiss said, upbeat on Sri Lankan government plans to increasingly engage in international capital markets.
The fund will surely attract foreign investor capital into Sri Lanka bonds, he alluded.Ceylon Asset Management Managing Director Dulindra Fernando said, The Ceylon Dollar Bond Fund has the potential to begin what non-resident Indians have done for Indian capital markets.
We believe it is time for Sri Lankan diaspora as well as Lankans living abroad, to begin investing in Sri Lankan capital markets due to attractive valuations available, expressed Fernando.The CDBF has been approved for investment by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, while it is the first dollar-denominated unit trust licensed by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka. Ceylon Asset Management is an associate company of Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd and Commercial Credit & Finance PLC.

Govt. bows down to reality: Wimal
	
The Joint Opposition said today the Government was eventually compelled to go behind China for assistance to revive Sri Lankas economy despite their vituperative anti-Chinese campaign in the pre-election period.
National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader MP Wimal Weerawansa said anti Chinese sentiments were whipped up at that time to send the previous government home.
The Government has realised that its so called masters wont give a dime to them and therefore had turned towards China. The Government in the past said that Sri Lanka would become a colony of China at the rate that country is assisting us, he told a news conference held at the N. M. Perera Centre in Borella.
He said the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had said at the end of his tour to China that the Colombo Port City would be developed as commercial hub and a land of acre 3,000 would be given to China to construct an industrial zone at Hambantota Port.
All these project were launched by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Many alleged that the Hambantota Port was not commercially viable and there was a giant rock in the middle of it. Today, it had been proved otherwise, he said.
The MP said these actions only prove that the government had no proper strategic plan to develop the country and said that it had announced to launch a plan after the President Maithripala Sirisena returns from G7 Summit.
For over a year, the government had run the country without a proper plan, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

US embassy launches Interview Waiver Program
	
The US Embassy in Colombo today launched the Interview Waiver Program (IWP) for eligible visa applicants in Sri Lanka and Maldives.

The embassy said in a statement that the program allows eligible applicants to renew their visas without appearing for a personal interview. IWP may be used only by applicants who have previously traveled to the United States and are renewing B1/B2 visitor visas issued after April 2008. First-time applicants are not eligible. The U.S. Embassy in Colombo will accept applications only from Sri Lankans and Maldivians resident in the Consular District.
This new program will streamline visa processing while enhancing our customer service to Sri Lankan and Maldivian visa applicants, U.S. Ambassador Atul Keshap said. The program is meant to help facilitate travel to the United States.
All visa applicants will be automatically considered for the program after completing the DS160 online application form and paying the regular processing fees. Previous travel history will determine eligibility for IWP. The online program will prompt those not meeting program requirements to schedule a regular visa appointment.
Eligibility for IWP does not guarantee visa issuance. Approved applications will be ready for pick-up within two weeks of document submission to the U.S. Embassy. Applicants that have already scheduled appointments with the Embassy are not eligible for the program. For more information on IWP or other visa issues, visit the Embassy website srilanka.usembassy.gov, it added.

Video: Vesting of lands with security forces
	
A tense atmosphere prevailed at the Jaffna District Secretariat this morning when a group of individuals including Member of the Northern Provincial Council M.K. Shivajilingam (TNA) staged a protest at the Jaffna District Secretariat against vesting several lands in Manippai, Anekkoddai, and Kulawadi areas with the security forces.
They obstructed the entrance to the District Secretaries office and the District Secretary was compelled to enter the office through a rear door. The Provincial Council member said lands in several areas had been vested with the security forces and that it was a serious injustice to the residents of the area.
They handed over a memorandum requesting him to resolve the issue. (Pix by Romesh Madusanka)
