Video: Akila Viraj disputes Rajitha's claims
	
Denying the statement made by Minister Rajitha Senaratne that the Cabinet had decided to hold the next general election under a new electoral system, his colleague and United National Party (UNP) official Spokesman and Deputy General Secretary Akila Viraj Kaiyawasam today said the Cabinet had not made such a decision.
Minister Kariyawasam told a media briefing in Colombo that no final decision had been made on the election reforms yet.
He said the UNP had agreed that the present Proportional Representation system should be abolished but believed that general elections should be held after the present regime completed hundred days in office.
He said the general elections would be held as soon as possible.
The election may be delayed by a few days but it will be held soon after the 100-day programme is over, Mr. Kariyawasam said.
He said UNP would play a major role in making the final decision.
At the same time he mentioned that discussions were on with regard to the electoral reforms and the constitutional reforms as a whole among all political parties.
He said that it was his party which got the incumbent President Maithripala Sirisena elected and that he was more or less a UNP President.
He defied the claim made by some SLFP members that Mr. Sirisena is their President.

Those SLFPers who criticised Mr. Sirisena during the Presidential Election cannot claim him to be their president now, he said. (Yohan Perera and Sanath Desmond)Video by Sanath Desmond

Ban on full-face helmets suspended
	
	The recently announced ban on full-face helmets due to a series of armed robberies had temporarily been lifted on a directive made by Minister of Public Order John Amaratunga amidst another motorcycle heist reported from Athurugiriya a short while ago.
	Minister Amaratunga speaking to the Daily Mirror said a number of requests from the public led to the temporary lift on the ban.
	As a Parliamentarian representing the public we should always listen to their woes and the ban was lifted as a result.
	However, the decision to impose the law will be reconsidered in the future, concerning the on going crime pattern committed wearing full-face helmets, the Minister said.
	The Minister had ordered IGP N. K. Illangakoon to lift the ban on full-face helmets, which was to come into effect from March 21.
	Police Spokesman SSP Ajith Rohana at a media briefing held last week announced that the full-face helmets would be implemented from March 21 following a series of armed robberies carried out at leading banks and financial institutes.
	Meanwhile, a sum of Rs.140, 000 being transported from a financial institute in Athurugirya was robbed at gun point by two motorcyclists this evening, the Police said.
	Meanwhile, a bus owner who was about to get married tomorrow in Hikkaduwa was gunned down in broad daylight this morning by two armed men with full-face helmets. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana and Sanath Desmond)

Video: Colombo Port City Projects main contractor expresses hope
	
	Expressing hopefulness that the government would give its nod to continue the Colombo Port City Project without delay, the projects main contractor CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt.) Ltd, today said that the completed work would be washed away leaving only half of it if the suspension continues for two weeks.
	The Company had completed 13 per cent of the entire project as at last Thursday, when the Cabinet suspended the Chinese-funded Project citing it had failed to provide relevant approvals from the concerned institutions.
	The Cabinet gave two weeks time for the company to submit approvals, a media statement said.
	Projects Health Safety and Environmental (HSE) Manager Kosala Perera explained that a marine project was extremely different to a land project, and that a marine project would be severely affected if it was suspended at any point before completion. 
	If a marine project was halted halfway, the sea would keep damaging the project until the project continues. About 150 metres of an armour rock (protective wall) that was built had already been washed away because of the suspension. Even if we were told to continue from the next day, we wont be able to start from where we stopped, he said adding that it would have been sensible to allow the project to continue while waiting for approval.
	Meanwhile, Projects Environmental Manager Tusitha Chandrasekara said they have obtained all the necessary reports and approvals from relevant government authorities to start the project, and that they have continued to obtain monthly reports through the Coast Conservation Department (CCD).
	 
	We have obtained all the approvals from relevant authorities. Otherwise the then government wouldnt have let us start the project. There is no basis on the reports that the approvals were given without a proper study because of previous governments tilting towards China, he said.
	He said they resubmitted the reports and approvals to fulfill the current governments call for approvals after its decision to suspend the project. We gave the same set of approvals and reports which we already had given. We hope the government would do a study within the two weeks and permit us to continue, he said.
	Deputy Project Manager Chandana Gunawardane said their employees and service providers would be gravely affected if the project was halted. We have 943 direct employees and about 5,000 people benefit from the project directly and indirectly. The livelihood of these people will be in risk if the project terminates, he said while complaining that authorities have forgotten the plights of the project employees.

Karuna condemns Ranil's remarks
	
	Slamming Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe for his remarks that Indian fishermen may be shot if they intruded into Lankan waters, DMK on Monday said it amounted to a slap on Prime Minister Narendra Modis face ahead of his tour to the island nation.
	It is not proper for the Lankan Prime Minister to give an interview amounting to a slap on the Indian Prime Ministers face ahead of his goodwill tour, DMK president M. Karunanidhi said.
	He was responding to the Lankan Prime Ministers interview to a Tamil TV channel about killing of Indian fishermen by Lankan Navy where he had said If someone tries to break into my house, I can shoot. If he gets killed...Law allows me to do that.
	Condemning the statement, Mr. Karunanidhi said such comments would not help address the issue but further complicate it.
	However, it was heartening to see External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj insist that the issue should be dealt in a humanitarian way and not legally, he said.
	Mr. Karunanidhi said it was not possible for fishermen in mid-seas to identify the international boundary and took exception to Mr. Wickramasinghes remarks in which he compared them to thieves breaking into a house, since fishing was their source of livelihood and wondered if law allowed gunning them down.
	Holding that not much headway was achieved in solving the vexed Tamils issue in that country during President Maithripala Sirisenas recent Indian visit, Mr. Karunanidhi urged Mr. Modi to take up the issue during his visit.
	Mr. Modis agenda should not be confined to implementing the 13th Amendment to the Sri Lankan Constitution, an Indian initiative aimed at giving more powers to provinces, but should also cover demilitarisation of north and east, retrieving Tamils owned land from Sinhalese and restoring it to them.
	During his discussions with the Sri Lankan President, (Modi) should also in detail take up the Tamils issue and the fishermen problem, Mr. Karunanidhi said in a statement.
	Since the Sri Lankan President valued relations with India, Mr. Modi should use the opportunity to solve the Tamils issues, he said. (Source: The Hindu)

Maithri: I belong to all
	
	From Sandun A Jayasekera in London
	Forming a national government in Sri Lanka was not an easy task as we aspired because our political culture was such that political parties always attempted to undermine and weaken the other, President Maithripala Sirisena said in London today.
	He made these remarks when he met a delegation from a 'Maithri Support Group in UK' affiliated to the UK branch of the UNP at his hotel, Park Lane Hilton.
	I am the common candidate and I am common and belong to all. I can't treat any one more or less and discriminate any one against others. This is not an easy task. But we must always try to do the difficult things for success. But the problem is that many can't realise this, President Sirisena said.
	A monumental challenge that lied between death and life had been mounted during the last Presidential Election and if something went wrong, the repercussions would have been devastating.
	We had a number of opportunities in the last few years in the form of tsunami in 2004, victory against separatist terrorism in 2009 and victory of the common candidate in 2015, since gaining independence to rebuild and unite the nation. But unfortunately we failed to exploit those opportunities to our benefit after the first two and now we are left with the last chance, he said.
	We must use the victory in 2015 for our advantage and use it to unite and rebuild the divided nation and develop the weakened economy but not to build palaces for high and mighty, President Sirisena stressed.
	President Sirisena emphasised that political parties, in the North as well as in the South must put an end to confrontational and vituperative politics.
	If the political parties were not able to put behind their opportunistic policies, no one would be able to prevent another war in ten years.
	The diplomatic corps of Sri Lanka had been subjected to humiliation and failure. A quick re-organisation is necessary to restore it on its former glory.
	Diplomatic posts should not be given as gift to friends, relatives and backers to spend their holiday in a greener pasture or to educate children in a foreign university.
	As Sri Lankans, you may have seen how members of various communities and nations live in London as one family. It is your duty to give this message to your kith and kin back home and make them aware the importance of living in peace and harmony with other communities, he said.
	The Sri Lankan delegation told the President Sirisena the difficulties they confronted when obtaining dual citizenship, the fee charged for dual citizenships and President promised to see the possibility of reducing the Rs. 500,000 fee.
	President of the 'Maithri Support Group in UK' Harshana Kannangara said even before President Sirisena decided to come forward as the common candidate at the Presidential poll, the group had decided to support him.
	The result was that the group had to face many a harassment, threat and intimidation in the similar manner those who rallied behind President Sirisena faced in Sri Lanka.
	However, it was a great relief that all ended well as we expected. We have no doubt that you will bring happiness, freedom and relief to all Sri Lankans and we will be behind you whether we are in Sri Lanka or in another country.
	We have no doubt that you would fulfil aspirations of all Sri Lankans during your rule and Sri Lanka will re-emerge as a proud and respected member of the global community once again during your rule, Mr. Kannangara stressed.
	Mr. Chatura Widyaratne, former Sri Lanka journalist also took part in the discussions.

MS to meet UNP, SLFP
	
	President Maitripala Sirisena, who is expected to return to the country this week, is expected to meet the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) for crucial talks in an effort to arrive at a consensus on the proposed constitutional amendments, political sources said yesterday.
	The President will return to the Island on March 12 after his State visit to Britain. It is learnt that he will meet the two main parties at the end of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modis visit to Sri Lanka from March 13 to 15. .
	Sources said the SLFP was insisting on electoral reforms and constitutional amendments being enacted simultaneously whereas the UNP was keen to enact them separately.
	The UNP is in favour of the total abolition of the executive presidency, to be effective from the conclusion President Sirisenas tenure. However, the SLFP is in favour of transferring some of the executive powers to the Legislature headed by a Prime Minister.
	It is in such a scenario that the President hoped to meet the two main political parties and arrive at a consensual work plan. The enactment of constitutional reforms is a key promise given to people at the January 8 presidential election and according to the 100-day programme; these reforms should be enacted by March 23. 
	Meanwhile, the Government is ready with a draft proposal on constitutional amendments to be referred this week to the Supreme Court for determination.(KB)

Narayanasamy urges PM to avoid Lanka visit
	
Former Union Minster V Narayanasamy has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to cancel his proposed visit to Sri Lanka and condemned Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes statement that the Indian fishermen trespassing into Lankan waters should be shot down.
In a statement here on Sunday, he took strong exception to Wickremesinghes comments and said that just because the Modi government sought to reap a good relationship with the neighbouring countries, the tiny island nation was threatening a mighty and strong India, due to the timid attitude of the Modi government.
He demanded that External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj return to India immediately and register condemnation of Sri Lankan Prime Minister Wickremesinghe.
Although the arrest of Indian fishermen continued unabated and at present, 285 Indian fishermen and 87 boats are under the Sri Lankan custody, the former Union Minster said that a red carpet welcome was accorded to former Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa, on his visit to India, when Modi government assumed power.
Narayanasamy said the arrest and seizure of the boats were continuing even after Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena assumed power and stated that Modi-Sirisena talks also would not give positive results in this regard.
The former Union Minster said it was natural for the fisherman of both the countries to cross their respective sea limits, since the maritime boundary is not demarcated.
Claiming that the previous Congress government at the Centre took immediate steps to secure the release of the arrested fishermen, Narayanasamy wanted the Parliament to condemn the Sri Lankan Prime Minister for his remark and pledge support to the Indian fishermen. (Express News Service)

PAFFREL to introduce criteria for party nominees
	
A series of criteria to be considered by political parties in giving nominations to their members would be introduced by the Peoples Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) on March 12th at the BMICH, its Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi said today.
He said they had invited all political party leaders to sign the official agreement March 12th Declaration comprising a set of essential qualifications peoples representatives should have.
He said they were able to introduce the proposals to some political party heads including UNP General Secretary Kabeer Hasheem and SLFP National Organiser Susil Premajayantha as they have extended their willingness already.
The March 12th Declaration was a product of a wide-ranging public discourse undertaken by the PAFFREL with the participation of experts from different sectors.
Among these criteria, eight matters have been listed as the most essential ones to be adhered to, by the respective parties in nominating persons for contesting the Parliamentary, Provincial Council and Local Authorities Election.
Speaking about the proposed election reforms, Mr. Hettiarachchi said they would emphasise on the minimum education level, political history of the nominees, the limit of money for spending for pre-election campaigns and a proper election calendar.
Further he urged that under the new election reforms, the politicians who had been accused of bribery or corruption charges and murder or criminal charges must not be nominated again. (Piyumi Fonseka and Darshana Sanjeewa)

	The Planning Director attached to the Railway Department Wijeya Samarasinghe said the arrests were launched by the Railway Security Service to put an end to the phenomenon of begging in the trains.
	According to Mr. Samarasinghe, at the moment no arrests were reported since it was the first day and the raids would be implemented in all types of trains especially in office trains.
	The raids had been started under the request of General Manager Wijeya Amaratunge, and the beggars would be produced in court after the arrests.
	Some beggars cause irritation to people. Most of them are well planned to exploit resources, to spread communicable diseases or to raise the crime rate. It is a violation of Sri Lanka Railways Authority Act. We have received considerable number of complaints from the train commuters asking for a proper solution, he added. (Piyumi Fonseka)
