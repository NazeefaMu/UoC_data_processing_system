A Shylock bankrolling wheeler-dealers
	

This papa of a leading political authority is said to be a typical Shylock lending money in billions to businessmen and he would brook no nonsense even if it is a days delay in theloan repayment.


However, unlike Shylock he would not go to the law to recover the loan plus the interest from his defaulting debtors; he would, instead, send a gang of goons who would hold a gun to the head of the defaulter to get him to cough up the money owed.
Most of this Shylocks clients are shady characters, they say.

Food: Friend or foe 
	

Food is vital for life. It provides the energy that we require to carry on with our daily activities. From cereals, pulses and legumes to fruits and vegetables, all these food items form part of a nutritious balanced diet. However there are instances when certain foods can induce allergy reactions in some people. It is important to be knowledgeable of the kinds of foods that we may be allergic to in order to prevent allergic reactions from flaring up. Some may just be mild responses whereas some can be severe. Dr. Shanthi Gunawardana, Consultant Community Physician, Ministry of Health addressed the questions that commonly arise regarding food allergies in this weeks edition of the Health Capsule. 
Food allergy is the sensitivity to certain food items. Some people may be sensitive towards some foods while others may not show any specific responses to those food items. Allergic reactions are caused by a chemical known as histamine produced by a type of white blood cell known as basophils. Histamine is responsible for bringing about allergy reactions in the body, mentioned Dr. Gunawardana. 

Common allergens 
She informed that fruits like pineapples, passion fruits and certain types of plantains and tomatoes and legumes such as green gram, lentils could induce allergies in some people. Some people may be allergic to vegetables and food preservatives used in certain food items. Allergies to peanuts and peanut products such as peanut butter is also prevalent. 

Allergy reactions 
Once a patient is exposed to an allergy, allergic reactions are displayed by the body due to histamine. Itching, rashes, breathing difficulties and swelling are some allergy responses. Sometimes a cough, runny nose or even sore throat or even wheezing is an indication of allergy, explained Dr. Gunawardana . She further explained that the severity of food allergies range from mild to moderate to severe. Certain foods bring about mild allergy reactions such as itching and a small rash as soon as it is consumed. Breathing difficulties and shocks are results of more severe forms of allergy. The allergy reaction and severity depends on the person and may vary from individual to individual. 
It is important to identify and be aware of foods that the body cannot tolerate as well as the allergies that one is susceptible to, in order to prevent allergy complications. This is best accomplished during infancy and complementary feeding. When complimentary feeding is commenced the infant should only be introduced to one food at a time. In this manner if an infant develops an allergy reaction, the causative food can be recognized immediately. A mixture of 2 or 3 foods should not be given at the same time. In these cases if an allergic reaction springs up, the causative food can not be identified easily if more than one food item is fed to the infant. Infants may show symptoms such as indigestion, runny nose and sneezing to particular foods indicating an allergy, explicated Dr. Gunawardana.


More about allergies 
Heaty and cold food classifications are very common in the Sri Lankan society. According to Dr. Gunawardana, Vegetables such as snake gourd that have a huge water content are believed to be cold foods and are often said to cause colds. Certain types of plantains cause runny nose and wheezing in some. Parents believe that it is not good to consume such foods at night as it may give children coughs and colds. The reality is that such symptoms are experienced due to allergic reactions. Some people may not experience these symptoms while others may show such symptoms to these foods, she stated. The consumption of certain fish can also induce allergies in people. 
It should be understood that one person being allergic to a certain type of food does not mean that other people would also be allergic to it. It depends on the individuals body structure and also family history. 
Passion fruit is a fruit that people commonly show allergies to. There are severe cases of the allergy where even coming into contact with the juice of the fruit can lead to allergic reaction. Certain drugs and antibiotics also induce allergies in some people, she indicated. 
Dr. Gunawardana further pointed out that there are instances when people may develop symptoms of allergy later in life even though they do not have a family history of allergies. This occurs when a genetically vulnerable situation is created. This could be due to environmental pollution, hair dyes and even some food, she mentioned.

 
Recovery
Diagnosis of the allergy is conducted through examination of patients and inquiries of the food that they had recently had. Usually anti histamine drugs are prescribed as treatment. The patient is advised to drink a lot of water. Allergy investigations can also be done through skin tests, added the doctor. 
The recovery from an allergy attack depends on the severity of the allergy. A mild reaction will only take 1-2 days to subside. Moderate to severe allergies may take about a week, she stated. On a final note, Dr. Gunawardana added that it is important to have knowledge of ones allergies and avoid the foods that cause them.

Former French President Sarkozy facing corruption charges
	

France (Daily Mail), 29 March 2018 - 
Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy has been ordered to stand trial for corruption and influence peddling involving a judge, from whom he tried to get information about an investigation, a legal source said Thursday. 
According to prosecutors, Sarkozys lawyer tried to get information from judge Gilbert Azibert over the status of a campaign financing investigation. 
In that inquiry, Sarkozy was suspected of accepting illicit payments from the LOreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt for his 2007 presidential campaign. 
Sarkozys lawyer Thierry Herzog and Azibert must also stand trial in the case dating back to 2014, the source said, confirming a report in French daily Le Monde.The decision to send the case to trial comes a week after Sarkozy - who already faces a trial for illegal campaign financing in his 2012 re-election campaign - was charged with accepting millions of euros in funding from late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi 
The new trial came about after investigators using phone-taps to examine the alleged links to Gaddafi began to suspect he had kept tabs on a separate case through a network of informants.

Good Friday: Thy slayers dear Jesus
	
Pic by Kishanie S. Fernando
This six-foot four-inch (64) mahogany sculpture shows the tortured and disfigured body of Jesus Christ after it was taken down from the cross and before it was laid to rest in the sepulcher. The image shows the almost life-like marks of the wounds made by the nails on his two hands and feet and gashes from the lances on his breast. The facial muscles with its hooded eyes and the mouth slightly open shows the agony He had undergone as he hung to death on the cross. 
The image reclines in a glass case made especially for the purpose. There are few ancient images in this same style found in our churches. However these images are painted. This image is completed in the natural finish of the wood, on the most part retaining its natural colour. It is carefully chiselled to retain the tension and texture of the muscles, the growth of the hair, and the linen cloth around the waist. Only the teeth in the mouth are done in white sandalwood while the hair and the waist cloth have been stained a darker shade to add contrast. 
The sculptor of this extraordinary piece of art is Raymond Fernando of Moratuwa, who also sculptured the St. Joseph Vaz statue that adorned the stage at the Canonization of the Saint at Galle Face Green in 2015. This is his 130th statue. Many of his masterpieces of the crucified Christ on the cross, Mother Mary and the Saints adorn our local churches while it was his statue of Our Lady of Madhu that was gifted to Pope Francis on his visit to Sri Lanka for the Canonization. Mr. Fernando says that the success of this image which began as a mere 6 5 log from a saw mill in Koralawella was due to prayers, perseverance and the encouragement of his wife, Shiranthi, family and friends. The image took him a full two months to complete.

The sculpture can be seen at All Saints Church Borella and will be used for the veneration after the Good Friday Service this year.

Govt. invited China, India power struggle into SL: Gota
	
The government has invited the power struggle between China and India into the country by handing over national assets to these two countries, former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa said.
He said the Hambantota Port was leased out to China by the government citing false reasons and India was offered the Mattala Airport afterwards.
We had plans to make the port viable. After coming to power, this government stopped all projects for two years. Then, it leased out the Hambantota Port to China after creating a bogus debt trap. When India became nervous, the government offered them the Mattala Airport. Any upcoming government or leader will have to address this issue and overcome it, he told a Viyath Maga Seminar held in Kuliyapitiya on Wednesday.
He said the monopoly of the world economy was shifting towards the Asian Region and Sri Lanka should seize the opportunity to successfully face this economic transition.
We should gear ourselves to seize the opportunity to develop the country and to uplift the economy of the people. We should not rely too heavily on our youth to generate an income working as labourers. The skills of our youth should be improved and for that, we need to change our education policy, he said.
Mr. Rajapaksa said those who are attempting to topple the government should have a backup plan ready on how to run the country afterwards.
"You cant simply defeat the government and then start thinking of policies and plans. We have to think about them now and make long-term and short-term plans to develop the country and to uplift the livelihoods of the people, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

The incumbent provincial bigwig is being increasingly sidelined by the powers that be these days giving the credence to a current rumour that a close kinsman of a very high political authority is now being groomed for this high post, they say.

The incumbent being given the cold shoulder, now a highly disillusioned one, is not even being invited to important public functions in the province. The provincial politicos who now ignore the incumbent are said to be racing to warm their way into the graces of the character expected to succeed the latter shortly.
The dejected incumbent is said to have begun telling all and sundry that he has decided to quit politics.

He is not here; He is risen from the dead
	
In an Easter message the Sri Lanka Catholic Bishops Conference (SLCBC) said yesterday the words of two heavenly messengers resound in our ears, Why do you look for the living among the dead He is not here; He has risen. (Luke 24: 5)
The joyful season of Easter invites us to deepen our knowledge of Jesus and to be renewed in the awareness that the Risen Saviour is alive in our midst, the SLCBC said.
At Easter we bring the Liturgical Year to its climax proclaiming Jesus of Nazareth as the Risen Lord and Saviour. We let the words of the two heavenly messengers resound in our ears, Why do you look for the living among the dead He is not here; He has risen. (Luke 24: 5). We rejoice that the Lord Jesus by His Resurrection conquered sin and death and gave a new hope for us to live on and to share in His own Resurrection. Easter invites us to die to sin and selfishness and begin a new life in Christ.
At Easter we also thank God for the gift of our faith in the Person of Jesus, the Christ. God has bestowed upon us this unique gift of our faith in Gods only begotten Son to experience His loving mercy towards us. In return we too are called to radiate Gods Love and Mercy to others in our day to day life.
The joyful season of Easter invites us to deepen our knowledge of Jesus and to be renewed in the awareness that the Risen Saviour is alive in our midst. Our faith in the Risen Saviour gives us comfort as He journeys and accompanies us (Cf. Luke 24:13-32) amid the uncertainties, trials and challenges life consists of. Easter reminds us that Christ does not abandon His flock and that He is always with us. This becomes the root cause of Christian joy.
Our special concern should be directed to children who are impoverished and exposed to drugs and other social evils
The Risen Saviour appeared to His disciples and granted them His gift of peace. Let us invoke the same gift of peace as we strive to foster peace through reconciliation in our country. We cannot forget that true peace is a result of justice. It is the responsibility of those who govern our country to establish a true democratic framework where all citizens irrespective of their caste, creed or colour are able to live in dignity and freedom.
We as a nation are living in the midst of socio-political uncertainties. Peoples needs have to be addressed with more understanding and sensitivity. We see the poor struggling and crying out asking for the basic requirements in life. There is also an ever widening gap between the rich and the poor in our Motherland. Amidst the sky rocketing prices of consumer items, day-to-day life is being made more and more burdensome to the poor.
Our Christian discipleship always invites us to care for those in need. It is our duty to recognize the face of Jesus in those who suffer. Our special concern should be directed to children who are impoverished as they are exposed to drugs and other social evils. May they recognize in and through us the joy and the beauty of believing in Jesus and of becoming His disciples. May we become the agents of the Peace and Reconciliation that the Risen Saviour communicated to
His disciples.
We wish all our faithful and our readers the Joy and the Peace of theRisen Saviour.

Introducing bond report in court illegal: Gamini Marapana PC
	
Gamini Marapana PC who appeared for Arjun Aloysius and Kasun Palisena in the revision bail application filed before the Court of Appeal yesterday, challenged the introduction of the bond report into the Magisterial Inquiry as it was inadmissible in a court of law. Therefore, the materials, based on which the Fort Magistrate had given the bail order on the suspects, cannot be regarded as evidence, the PC said.
He argued that the insertion of the bond report into evidence had prejudiced the court by contaminating the Magistrates mind against his clients to take away the 'presumption of innocence' that his clients are entitled by the law.
At the onset of the case, Presidents Counsel Gamini Marapana, who supported the revision bail application filed on behalf of Arjun Aloysius and Kasun Palisena, drew the attention of the court to the repercussions his clients had to face due to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the bond controversy, arguing that his clients had been tried and convicted by the press.
Mr. Marapana was of the view that the prosecution in the Magisterial Inquiry had attempted to link the Public Property Act to the case for the simple reason that the Bail Act cannot be applied in the inquiry with regard to the suspects. He said it was a clear abuse of the law aimed at his clients, as there was no danger of them fleeing the country.
Mr. Marapana reasoned that the 1982 Public Property Act (PPA) was introduced during a period where a lot of terrorist activities were prevalent and therefore it gave court the provision to safeguard public properties by imposing heavy sanctions on the culprits who misused them. He said that the PPA is now being used merely to lock people up.
Mr. Marapana formulated his main legal argument in the backdrop of the legal concept of the Rule of Law considering the notion of the presumption of innocence.
Mr. Marapana challenged the inclusion of the Presidential Commission of Inquirys report on the bond issue as evidence by the prosecution.
He said, even though, the Attorney General can initiate criminal actions against individuals based on the material gathered during the commissions inquiry under the section 24 of the Commissions inquiry Act, the material of the Commission cannot be regarded as evidence in the court proceedings.
Elaborating on the legal nature of such Commissions, Mr. Marapana was of the view that commissions materials are inadmissible in the court of law as commissions are not identified as judicial or quasi-judicial body by the law.
Citing several previous Supreme Court judgments in connection with the nature of such commissions reports and recommendations, he said a report of a Commission will not be regarded as evidence in any court according to the law. Thereby, he challenged prosecution placing the bond report into the magisterial inquiry and said this is itself illegal.
He contested that the material (bond report) on which the Magistrate had given the bail order is inadmissible in court since the report of a commission cannot be taken as evidence in court according to the law.
Citing several precedents, Mr. Marapana argued that commissions recommendations have no consequential effect in nature; hence its findings or the report has no legal or binding effect by the court of law.
The reason behind placing bond commissions report in Magistrates court by the state (prosecution) was to prejudice the court, thereby contaminating the mind of the Judge against the suspects Mr. Marapana said.
He also said that the Magistrate in her bail order had also quoted the bond report frequently by citing various findings of the Commissions inquiry, hence, the illegal inclusion of the bond report had flawed the entire magisterial inquiry.
Mr. Marapana in his submission also contested the inclusion of the Public Property Act into the incident. He said that under the PPA, the public property is identified as a movable property, however, the allegations levelled against Arjuna Mahendran was in respect of criminally misappropriating and breaching the trust over a duty assigned upon him (duty to collect borrowings for the government), therefore, the offence doesnt fall under the Public Property Act.
Thereby, he requested the court to issue notices to the respondents of the revision petition and also requested for an interim relief to be given granting bail for his clients.
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda PC was also present in the court of appeal while Mr. Marapana was submitting his arguments and addressing the court, ASG Kodagoda said that he also wished to reply to the attorney for the petitioners submission as it was relating to the legality of the magisterial inquiry and also said he wished to apprise the court on the legal jurisdiction of the court to hear the petition.
However, he was told that there was no time for this, hence, the bench comprising Justice Shiran Gunaratne and Prithi Padman Surasena (President) re-fixed the case for further submissions for May 18.
Presidents Counsel Gamini Marapana, Presidents Counsel Kalinga Indatissa and Counsel Naveen Marapana appeared for the petitioners.
Earlier, the Fort Magistrate remanded the suspects considering the allegations levelled against them under the Public Property Act. Later, the case was shifted to the High Court as it was found that the magistrate cannot release them on bail as per the PPA, where one who misappropriated public property causing more than Rs.25, 000 damage to the State had no chance of being given bail relief except in exceptional circumstances or by a High Court Judge.
However, Colombo High Court also refused to grant bail to the suspects, setting aside the suspects petitions. As a result, the suspects had filed a revision bail petition in the Court of Appeal, asking to revise the bail order of the Magistrate and the decision of the High Court. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Is hay fever incurable 
	

The term Allergic rhinitis, may not sound familiar to some of our readers. But if you think in the more familiar term of Hay fever, its very likely that visuals of an annoying array of symptoms including incessant sneezing, runny nose and itchy eyes will surface in your minds. Like Asthma, Allergic rhinitis is believed to be one of the diseases which are becoming increasingly common in the society due to urbanization and industrialization. Furthermore, even though not usually serious, it can cause extreme discomfort to the sufferer. This is why we decided to consult Dr. Bodhika Samarasekera, Consultant Respiratory Physician, District General Hospital, Hambantota and the Joint Secretary of the Sri Lanka College of Pulmonologists, to obtain more information on allergic rhinitis.


Getting to know hay fever
Allergic rhinitis, commonly known as hay fever, is a common chronic respiratory condition marked by a group of symptoms affecting mainly the nose, explained Dr. Samarasekera. 
These symptoms usually occur as a result of inhaling something that the person is allergic to. The common allergens that cause these symptoms are dust, animal dander and pollen. However symptoms can also occur when you eat foods that you are allergic to. 
Even though allergic rhinitis itself is not life threatening, morbidity from the condition can be significant. This condition can coexist with other disorders such as asthma and may be associated with asthma exacerbation, explained the doctor. 
Allergic rhinitis may keep children away from school and make adults absent at work. Hence, in addition to the physical effects on the individual, it causes an economical burden on the society overall. According to Dr. Samarasekera, the prevalence of the allergic rhinitis is increasing throughout the world and may be associated with upward trend of outdoor and indoor pollution. Currently, approximately 10% to 30% of the adult population of the world and 40% of children are affected by this respiratory condition. 

Presentation
A runny nose (frequently watering nose) is the commonest symptom of allergic rhinitis. Along with this they can get itching of the nose and itching and watering eyes as well. However these symptoms can be minimal and can disappear quickly once allergen is no longer present, explained the doctor. 
Sneezing is the other common symptom that these individuals are frequently complaining of and the swelling of the nasal tissues may lead to impaired smell and the taste. 
Allergic rhinitis may also cause itching in mouth, throat and skin. In addition, you may develop nasal congestion, sore throat, headache and coughing. Furthermore some patients may complain of a plugged in feeling in the ears and under eye puffiness, he continued. 
Even though symptoms of allergic rhinitis could occur at any stage of life, most of these individuals develop this condition during childhood. It is also important to remember that intensity, frequency and duration of the symptoms may vary according to the individual.

 
Causes
Allergens, together with the response of our immune system to those allergens cause the symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Indoor or outdoor dust, pollen, pet dander, grasses and moulds are just a few examples of common irritants. A person can be exposed to these irritant in outdoors or indoors. 
When an allergen hits your system, your body will try to fight it off with a chemical substance called histamine. It is histamine that causes your body to produce mucus and tears to fight with the allergen and this process leads to the group of symptoms of allergic rhinitis. 
In addition to those common allergens, there are several other allergens that can cause allergic rhinitis. Cockroach excrement, tobacco, latex and chemicals are a few examples, according to Dr. Samarasekera. Furthermore, certain food allergies such as nuts, eggs, milk and wheat can also cause allergic rhinitis. However it is also important to remember that the response to these allergens may vary according to individuals, stresses the doctor. 

Genetic and Allergic rhinitis
The tendency to develop allergic reaction to extrinsic allergens has a genetic component, explained Dr. Samarasekera. In susceptible individuals, exposure to certain foreign proteins leads to allergic sensitization. Hence allergic rhinitis is also associated with a group of other conditions such as asthma, eczema, sinusitis, and nasal polyps. 

Treatment
Allergic rhinitis is not a curable disease, proclaimed the doctor, at the same time, assuring that with a well integrated, medically monitored plan of care, a person can have a normal active life. 
The best treatment plan differs from individual to individual. It depends on several factors including a persons severity of symptoms, specific allergen type etc. The most important part of the management is to prevent from the exposure of specific allergens that cause symptoms such as dust, animal dander, cockroaches, pollen and moulds, according to Dr. Samarasekera. Hence environmental control measures to prevent outdoor pollution and indoor pollution play a crucial role in preventing episodes of allergic rhinitis exacerbations. Bed linen should be clean and free from dust and all carpets should be vacuumed frequently. Not keeping pets such as cats is also an important part of care plan, especially because animal dander is well known to precipitate symptoms of allergic rhinitis.
He explains that in our country the smoke from firewood, mosquito coils and joss sticks (Handun Kooru) may also precipitate symptoms. 
He stresses the importance of seeking a doctors advice with regard to patients who are suffering from symptoms of allergic rhinitis. The doctors will then asses you to start a management plan, which may require you to undergo a few blood tests and skin tests for specific allergens. 
Medications are also needed for the effective control of symptoms and your doctor may prescribe oral antihistamine and corticosteroid nasal spray in your treatment plan. It is very important to remember that these medications should be taken for longer duration in order to effectively control of the condition. By following the correct treatment plan and by adjusting life accordingly, a person suffering from allergic rhinitis can lead a normal and a productive life, concluded the doctor.

Light of Easter amid uncertainty of social change
	
The modern world can learn from the earliest Christianity that diffused this culture in ancient middle-eastern cities like Corinth, Ephesus and Colossae
This planet, our common home, has to be saved together or nations must be ready to run the risk of perishing in its flames together
On Easter Sunday, Christians worldwide celebrate the Glorious Resurrection of Jesus Christ, the core-truth of their religious faith and spirituality. Jesus of Nazareth thus became an Eternal Galilean who will rule the world and human history till the end of time. The crucified Nazarene, the carpenters son, the authoritative preacher, the healer of the sick and the possessed, the threat of the demons has vanquished the gloom of the grave and the darkness of that cave having emerged glorious in the brilliance of the Risen Life. Death has been defeated, doubts have been cleared, fears have been destroyed, hope reassured, peace dawned as the divine teacher triumphed in glory. For all what technology and science can do to prolong life, it would be clearly impossible to resist death and its rampage through humankind. Here lies the radical weakness of human endeavour and the ultimate failure of human resources to ensure life and even succeed in their fight for defeating terminal diseases like cancer, chronic heart disease and aids, the trinityof death.
Two days had lapsed without any sign of their master coming back alive from the tomb. But then, dawned the third day and it was all changed. Christ was alive. He came in through their closed doors exorcising their gripping fears and dispelling the doubts that had crippled all his disciples

Light of the Risen Christ
Easter means a rising and a new dawn. The brilliance of the light of the Risen Christ fills the Easter season. The stories of the close followers of Jesus show that they were a distraught lot after the condemnation and the death of their master. A pale of sorrow, fear and restlessness had overtaken them. Two days had lapsed without any sign of their master coming back alive from the tomb. But then, dawned the third day and it was all changed. Christ was alive. He came in through their closed doors exorcising their gripping fears and dispelling the doubts that had crippled all his disciples. He came to them with the greetings and blessings of peace. He would stalk the beaches of Galilee once again and wait for them to return to land to partake of a meal in the open and windy beach. He would be a travelling companion to them during their journeys, listening patiently to their stories of frustration and sit down to break bread with them in an inn to reveal his glory. He would appear to the doubting companions, showing the wounds of his crucifixion, challenging their disbelief and leading them to have faith in him as the Risen Lord. The Jewish Sabbath that was Saturday would now be replaced by Sunday, the glorious day of the resurrection. Fifty days later, the disciples empowered by the Spirit of the Risen Lord, would openly and courageously preach the news about the crucifixion and resurrection of the Lord and would even dare death for his names sake. They would criss-cross lands beyond the city of Jerusalem and Palestine to take this good news to many middle-eastern cities and even reach imperial Rome to challenge its idolatry and immorality demanding that they believe in Jesus the Redeemer and change their lives for the better into a new lifestyle of holiness, sanctity and righteous living. Simon Peter who was once a humble fisherman from Northern Galilee would choose to be crucified with the head down and Paul the die-hard Pharisee who converted would reach Rome and be beheaded because of his brave preaching. The later Christian believers in Rome under severe persecution from Roman pagan emperors would bravely face martyrdom for the sake of the faith they had in the crucified and Risen Lord. Under the severe anti-Christian culture of politics and prevailing idolatry of the cosmic pantheon, Christians underwent cruel forms of persecution with the first popes, practically all of them, ending their lives as martyrs. 
It has been said often in Christian tradition, that the blood of the martyrs is the seed of faith and so has it been as history of Christianity has unfolded in the first 500 years. However, in the middle ages, it was the golden age of Christianity in the Western European continent. Then came the modern and post-modern times, when the Christianity stabilized, traversed through various other continents but not without having to face and being challenged inevitably by newer and more subtle anti-Christian ideologies, philosophies and socio-cultural currents of different hues. The greatest danger and threat to religions and religious practice in the modern world is secularism that radically marginalizes them and other social ideologies that are extreme forms of social conflict. But, we also see that a world without religious values is more and more turning inhuman and decadent societies are emerging on our horizons, much to the regret of all wise thinkers, who like to see a humanity become more human and a world becoming more peaceful and secure. Libertine thinking and nuclear arms race are the twin hydras that seem to sway over the world-scene today. They create fear, anxiety and insecurity on the entire world-stage and have to be dispelled, sooner the better with good understanding, solidarity and collaboration among the nations. Dialogue appears to be the language that is most suited for our modern age of diversity in our daily conversations. This planet, our common home, has to be saved together or nations must be ready to run the risk of perishing in its flames together. Collective wisdom and mutual understanding are the two wings that will soar the nations to the noble heights of world-peace and collaboration for a better and safer world. One has to rise from a false provincialism, a die-hard extremism that is the bane of modern world.
It has been said often in Christian tradition, that the blood of the martyrs is the seed of faith and so has it been as history of Christianity has unfolded in the first 500 years
Christianity: Agent of social change and transformation
Our present world has risen from the dust and ashes of two world-wars. It has learnt its lessons that have been bitter, overwhelming and fraught with untold anxiety, fear and suffering. These wars and the present racial, ethnic, religious and cultural conflicts are wreaking havoc on entire nations and their future prospects for prosperity and stability. The spirit of the risen Christ, on the contrary, has gripped his followers world-wide to spread the spirit of solidarity among nations and peoples, peace and concord among warring factions making the world capable of transcending language, ethnic and socio-cultural differences thus leading nations to build a world of good understanding, mutual appreciation and collaboration. Beginning from the time of Constantine the Great emperor on the fourth century AD down to different epochs wherever Christianity had penetrated, it had raised schools and hospitals to serve in the cause of education and caring for the sick and infirm. It has favoured all democratic forms of government and civil life, fostered human rights in favour of human dignity and social justice in favour of human liberation. It readily welcomes an economic system of abundance but with sharing. Compared with the paucity of failures and defects, Christianity has contributed much for a more humane, peaceful and better world throughout the past 20 centuries. The culture of human solidarity that was introduced by St. Paul, the first evangelizer of the ancient nations helping people to sink religious differences, social class distinctions and even gender differences has penetrated even todays thinking. There is so much effort to make all religions respected, all human beings honoured and the femininity of womanhood restored to its proper dignity with equal opportunities open to them. The modern world can learn from the earliest Christianity that diffused this culture in ancient middle-eastern cities like Corinth, Ephesus and Colossae, and even in imperial Rome and its colonies. This brought in a revolutionary social transformation in that world and this good trend continues unabated ever since, penetrating even the 21st century. World society is clamouring for human dignity, human rights, democratic freedoms, sharing and the care of the poor and the socially marginalized. We need the blending of the wisdom of the spiritual gurus, sages and saints (Gnosis) with that of the skills (techn) of the technicians and scientists to carry the present world-society forward. 
Easter has ushered in a new world where courage, hope and solidarity constitute the basic features that can engender a new era
Easter has ushered in a new world where courage, hope and solidarity constitute the basic features that can engender a new era. It is a world society whose culture would be characterized by moral and ethical values, respect for human life and dignity with social justice ensuring prosperity for all. The spiritual and ethical concerns would play a decisive role even in regulating socio-political and social life without which it would be extremely difficult, nay almost impossible, to build a society of righteousness and justice. Even medical science must delve into the field of mental and spiritual health. If theres an area where truth, justice and honesty are to be most desired , it is politics wherein much of greed, bribery and corruption, in fact, the most dangerous social evils, have to be weeded out and eradicated for good by effective reforms and change The primacy of the ethical and the spiritual is non-negotiable. Let us call it simply a categorical imperative in the subtle words of Emmanuel Kant, the renowned German ethicist and philosopher. The spirit of the Christian Easter challenges us to spread and diffuse this spirit of hope and solidarity and thereby usher in a new world that is worthy of its creator.

## Title: Managing MetS to live healthy

Managing MetS to live healthy
	

The present day food consumption patterns have shifted leading to several adverse effects on human health. Modern food habits, regular consumption of fast food and the unhealthy lifestyles of people cause weight gain and increase the risk of developing 03 sisters of chronic diseases named diabetes, hypertension and increased blood lipids. The harmony of these metabolic disorders is associated with the metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is not a disease, but indicates the health risk.
According to some research studies, metabolic syndrome is a growing epidemic worldwide where the prevalence reaches 25-50% in some urban areas of South Asia. This may be due to unhealthy eating habits and lifestyles.
Dietician and Nutritionist Wasundara Rathnaweera spoke about metabolic syndrome and highlighted the following information related to this topic.

Metabolic Syndrome (MetS)
MetS also known as cardio-metabolic syndrome, is a cluster of conditions, comprising abnormal glucose metabolism, abnormal lipid metabolism, abdominal obesity and high blood pressure, explained Rathnaweera.
MetS is strongly associated with developing cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and Type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Risk factors
Rathnaweera mentioned the causes of MetS. There are two major factors. The first involves significant factors including insulin resistance, abdominal obesity (modifiable risk factors), physical inactivity, age, gender and genetic. Second involves insignificant factors which include hormonal changes and people with specific medication (ex: medication for mental disorders), she explained.

Symptoms
Rathnaweera spoke about the symptoms of MetS. Most of the metabolic risk factors except large waist circumference have no signs or symptoms until the condition becomes serious. However, sometimes people with high blood glucose levels, especially Type 2 diabetes mellitus may experience frequent urination, increased thirst, tiredness, sweating and blurred vision.
Sometimes high blood pressure may be indicative by headaches; but most of the time patients with this condition do not showany symptoms.

Diagnosis
According to the latest definition of International Diabetes Federation (IDF), for a person to be identified with MetS, that person should have;
Large waist circumference - a waistline that measures = 90cm for men and = 80 cm for
Women (For South Asians including
Sri Lankans)
Plus any two of followings,
1. High triglyceride levels - =150 mg / dL or specific treatment for this lipid abnormality
2. Reduced high density lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol levels - less than 40 mg/dL (1.03 mmol/L) in men or less than 50 mg/dL (1.29 mmol/L) in women of this good cholesterol.
3. High blood pressure - 130/85 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or higher.
4. Elevated fasting plasma glucose levels (FPG) - = 100 mg/ dL or previously diagnosed type 2 diabetes.

Treatment
In terms of treatment Rathnaweera proposes two interventions; Primary management of MetS is achieving a healthy lifestyle with moderate calorie restriction (aiming for a healthy weight), moderate increase in physical activity, change in dietary composition and other lifestyle changes such as managing stress, smoking cessation.

Next intervention is drug therapy or medicine.Recommendations
Rathnaweera opined that prevention is better than cure. Therefore, if you are a person prone to this risk, you should aim at avoiding complications or at least to delay the emergence. If you have already developed the conditions or any, still you should try to minimize the complications as first line treatment.
She has recommended changes in lifestyle, including a healthy diet and increasing physical activity. Because, a small weight reduction would greatly help to increase the insulin sensitivity, select healthy types of carbohydrates and fats, limit simple sugars as sweets, sugar and refined carbohydrates (Ex; polished rice, flour preparations), have a healthy blend of dietary fats and limit or avoid saturated fat intake. (Ex; red meat, fast food), incorporate healthy fat sources (Ex; nuts) into your diet, limit salt intake, cut down excess calorie intake, have a variety in food, engage in physical activity (Ex; walking, jogging), stop smoking, and manage stress by engaging in activities such as meditation and yoga.
In conclusion, metabolic syndrome puts you in a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases and also increases the risk of mortality due to cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, it is very important to be away from risk factors that you can control to live a healthy life.

Millions of Indian students to resit exam after test paper leaked
	

NEW DELHI AFP March29, 2018-India on Thursday vowed to strengthen its online security after high school exam papers were leaked ahead of crucial tests, forcing millions of students to resit their finals.
Education Minister Prakash Javadekar said an investigation was underway into how the mathematics and economics papers were accessed and spread via WhatsApp before the exam.
The criminals who did this wont be spared. I am sure police will catch these people soon. Let me assure that we will further improve the system and make it foolproof, he told reporters Thursday.
It is another embarrassment for a government which has weathered storms around alleged cracks in its Aadhaar system, a database containing the personal details of more than one billion Indians.

Buddhasasana Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera said today the government had decided to prohibit pandals on Vesak and Poson Poya Days to stress the need to focus on the spiritual aspect of religion rather than on mundane activities.
He told Daily Mirror that the government had made this decision to safeguard Buddhist principles and encourage Buddhists to engage in spiritual activities during Vesak and Poson.
The minister said this move had also been approved by the Mahanayake Theras.
He said short films based on Jataka stories would be distributed to temples.
The minister said it would be preferable to hold dansals near temples or within temple premises and pointed out that the prohibition on pandals would only apply for specific days and pandals could be put up on other days. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Only option for the PM is to step down: Dilan
	
The only option to prevent the removal of the prime minister on a no-confidence motion and protect the yahapalana government was for Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to step down before April 4, State Minister Dilan Perera said today.
He said the UPFA, SLFP and the UNP wanted to protect the government and continue till 2020 but the only roadblock was the Prime Minister and therefore he should resign from the post and save himself, President Maithripala Sirisena, the government and the country from embarrassment and indignity.
The state minister told a media conference no one wants an election or to topple the government but for more that two and half years the SLFP did its best to minimize the damages caused by the bond scam to the economy, country and to good governance but the PM blocked them all.
"The constituent partners of good governance like the TNA, the SLMC, the ACMC, the National Union of Workers and the Democratic Peoples Front must vote for the motion if they want to save the government," the state minister said. We wanted political and legal measures against perpetrators of the bond scam and the damages recovered. Nothing happened. Then we proposed to the President to appoint a committee and the result was a 11-member committee led by Minister Nimal Siriripala De Silva. We submitted a report after a thorough inquiry of the bond scandal. Most of the allegations in the motion against the Prime Minister were based on the findings of this report. Legal and political remedial measures on the bond scandal have started now.
Commenting on Minister Wajira Abeywardana's comments that the Premier could be replaced only if he commited suicide, was assassinated or stepped down was wrong because the President was mandated to appoint a Prime Minister if and when a no-confidence motion was passed in Parliament.

Precious stones as a medium for deriving Vishvashakti To fulfil human needs and aspirations
	

The value of precious stones is a subject extensively dealt with in both Astrology and Numerology.
We have already discussed the value of precious stones from Astrological points of view in a series of articles earlier. We propose to discuss the value of precious stones as dealt with in Numerology in a new series beginning with this article.
Maha Rishis of ancient India and sages from great ancient civilizations that flourished in countries like Babylon and Mesopotamia had discovered the existence of a Great Universal Scheme of Rhythm or harmony encompassing every element manifest in whatever form in our world. And it had also dawned on them that man being an integral part of the world system, had to be in tune with this great scheme if he was to bring to fruition his full potential as a human being.
Ancient sages also had discovered that man could derive immense power from the rays emitted by planets through the medium of precious stones to be harnessed for the fulfillment of his worldly needs and aspirations.
Peoples in Asian countries which had come under the influence of the Indo-Aryan civilization even today use precious stones as a medium for not only receiving the beneficial effects of the rays of planets, but also for dispelling the malefic planetary influences.
(To be continued next week)

Precious stones or gems serve as a medium for deriving the Vishvashakti or the subtle power pervading the entire universe to:
(1) Acquire our worldly needs
(2) Fulfill our aspirations
(3) Cure ailments that afflict us physically and mentally
(4) Dispel and protect ourselves from malefic planetary influences
(5) reinforce our moral strength and
(6) To bring good luck.

Gemstones and the purposes for which they have been recommended by ancient sages are:
<U+F03C>Ruby: To gain political power and high political office, good health and to ward off diseases of the liver
<U+F03C>Pearl: To gain wealth, peace of mind and popularity
<U+F03C>Emerald: To get relief from neurological problems, to gain prosperity from trade
<U+F03C>Coral: For overpowering enemies, gaining wealth, love and happiness
<U+F03C>Diamond: Winning love and comfortable living free from want
<U+F03C>Yellow sapphire: Good health, relief from blood pressure, affluence
<U+F03C>Garnet: Good health, recovery from skin diseases, high status
<U+F03C>Cats Eye: Overpowering enemies, Relief from pains and wounds
<U+F03C>Turquoise: Peace of mind, Winning love, marital happiness

President closes stable after horse bolted: JO
	
While welcoming the Presidents decision to move the Central Bank which was under the Prime Ministers purview back to the Finance Ministry, the joint opposition yesterday said however, the said decision could be regarded as closing the stable after the horse had bolted.
President Maithripala Sirisena, in an Extraordinary Gazette issued on Wednesday, moved two key institutions; the Central Bank and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); which were under the National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry headed by the Prime Minister, back to the Finance Ministry.
Joint opposition member MP Bandula Gunawardena told a news conference that the said decision taken by the President was really important at this juncture and added that it was also appreciable that the President had scraped the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management headed by the Prime Minister.
The Prime Minister has taken the Central Bank to his purview, appointed Arjuna Mahendran as its governor and the controversial Central Banks bond scam took place thereafter incurred a staggering Rs.2,000 billion loss, which have resulted his fate at present, he said.
He said the Prime Minister was still safeguarding Arjuna Mahendran. He also said the No-Confidence motion brought by the Joint Opposition against the PM was mainly based on the irregularities which had taken place on his part with regard to the bond scam.
He said however, the Presidents decision could be regarded as closing the stable after the horse had bolted, because he was instrumental for bringing in irreparable loss to the country, even if he had step down from his post or had lost the No-confidence motion.
He also said following the said decision of the President, he had still hinted that it would be difficult to run the country in this manner. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

The joint opposition today said President Maithripala Sirisena should ask Sri Lanka Freedom Partys (SLFP) parliamentarians to support the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe so that he could be removed from the position without pruning his portfolios.
Joint Opposition member MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena told a news conference that there was no use of pruning the Prime Ministers portfolios one by one.
There is no use of cutting down branches of a tree randomly. In order to remove the tree completely, the President should ask SLFP parliamentarians to support the no-confidence motion against the Prime Minister, he said.
He said government members were now fighting against each other because of this no-confidence motion and added that the SLFP was in an attempt to expel the Prime Minister from his post they had appointed three years ago.
He also said it was better that these SLFP parliamentarians were wise enough to understand the matter even at this juncture.
At present, a riot has been created in the United National Party (UNP) and the leaders of it are having nightmares because they know the gravity of this no-confidence motion. Earlier, the President saved the Prime Minister despite him being incapable of handling the UNP, he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

President Maithripala Sirisena and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) are reported to have pledged their support to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe with regard to the no-confidence motion against him, the United National Party (UNP) said today.
UNP MP Kavinda Jayawardana said according to reports received from sources the President is backing the Prime Minister.
However, we are not sure to what extent the reports are true. What we know is that the President will protect the government which he created and the UNP will protect the President. When others defamed him, we stood by him. Even if all SLFPers leave the President tomorrow, we wont leave him. He is one of ours, he told a news briefing held at Sirikotha.
The MP said the objective of the joint oppositions no-confidence motion was to isolate the President and to destabilize the country.
MP Hirunika Premachandra said SLFP General Secretary and Minister Duminda Dissanayake has confirmed they would also back the Prime Minister.
The SLFP Secretary has said they will vote against the motion. Its the opinion of the party leader President Sirisena which is being expressed through the secretary. Therefore, the statements made by other SLFP members cannot be held as the official views of the party, she said.
Ms. Premachandra said the SLFP members at the Dehiwala- Mt.Lavinia Municipal Council decided to support the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) at the last moment due to the ambiguity in SLFP's decision-making prosess.
When I asked why they supported the SLPP, the SLFP members said they received contradictory instructions from President Sirisena, Minister Duminda Dissanayake and Minister Mahinda Amaraweera. The President has to resolve this, she said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

I looked upon Christ on the Cross 
A mangled body, a broken frame,

This God _man subject toabject shame.

A crown of thorns, as droplets trickle 
Of blood, sweat and tears co-mingled 
A spear-thrust causes a trickleonce again

As straining ribs and hanging arms

Reflect excruciating pain, 
I pause to ponder; Why hangs he there

Not Pilate, not the maddened mob, not even Judas Propelled him there. 
twas my sins and mine alone that nailed him to the tree 
That tree of salvation thatredeemed me. 
And yet what a poor return I make to thee 
I humbly beseech; Oh Lord I grope, I seek 
The spirit indeed is willing Lord 
But the flesh is weak.

Russian spys daughter is improving and expected to survive
	

The daughter of poisoned spy Sergei Skripal is improving rapidly in hospital and her condition is now stable, doctors have said.
In a statement, Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust said Yulia Skripal is improving rapidly and is no longer in a critical condition.
The development could prove key to the investigation into the chemical weapons attack - as it may mean Ms Skripal could soon be able to tell police about the moments before she and her father collapsed in a park.
She could also potentially identify whoever carried out the attack - which is now thought to have taken place at Mr Skripals suburban home.
Her father remains in a critical but stable condition after the nerve attack three and a half weeks ago, the NHS trust said.
Dr Christine Blanshard, medical director for Salisbury District Hospital, said: Im pleased to be able to report an improvement in the condition of Yulia Skripal.
She has responded well to treatment but continues to receive expert clinical care 24 hours a day.
I want to take this opportunity to once again thank the staff of Salisbury District Hospital for delivering such high quality care to these patients over the last few weeks. I am very proud both of our front-line staff and all those who support them.
The NHS trust has not said whether Ms Skripal is conscious or speaking.

Small cars drive vehicle registrations in February
	
Sri Lankas small car registrations continued its strong momentum in February although the total vehicle registrations slightly slipped from its January high, perhaps due to less number of days, according to registration data tracked by Colombo-based stock brokerage, JB Securities.
Motorcar registrations in February were slightly down to 4,881 units from 5,089 units in January but more than doubled from 2,091 units 12 months ago.
Vehicle registrations trended downwards in February perhaps due to a fewer number of days in the month. Small cars continued to show strong momentum, JB Securities Managing Director Murtaza Jafferjee said.
The month saw 778 units of brand new car registrations, slightly down from 842 units in January and marginally down from 786 units 12 months ago.
In the brand new category, Suzuki leads the market with 278 units, mostly Wagon R models. Maruti Alto came second with the registration of 200 units.
Deteriorating public transport service, growing population, migration of people to cities for jobs and rising incomes have resulted in more cars on the roads causing massive traffic jams in and around Colombo.
Many governments all around the world have grasped the issue, albeit too late, and are devising plans at the national level to tackle the growing congestion. Sri Lankan government however so far has shown lack of commitment to find a durable solution to the growing social and economic issue.
This week the government of New York proposed to impose a fee on vehicles entering Manhattans central business district, as a form of congestion pricing in a bid to help fund the citys faltering subway system.
Last month Singapore government cut the annual growth rate for cars and motorcycles to zero from 0.25 percent in view of land constraints for further expansion of the road network.
However, every month, Sri Lanka sees a whopping 30,000 motorcycle registrations. In February the number was 27, 139, out of which 16,279 units being scooters, the second biggest menace on Lankan roads after three-wheelers.
Meanwhile, three-wheeler registrations during the month came in at 1,477 units, slightly down from 1,544 units in January but up from 903 units 12 months ago.
As a point of reference in November 2015 this number was 13,688, Jafferjee said.
The taxation on a three-wheeler is approximately Rs.420, 000 pushing up the retail price to around Rs.750,000. Financing has been restricted by the regulator to 25 percent on macro-prudential grounds thus a potential buyer has to mobilize Rs.562,500 up front  a sum too far for many.
Three-wheelers may be a menace on the streets of Colombo and many a car owner will wish for its curtailment, but it is the lifeblood of rural Sri Lanka, in some cases literally for it acts as a make-do ambulance, he added.
Meanwhile, in February 182 units of premium cars were registered, down from 206 units in January but significantly up from 54 units 12 months ago.
Electric cars recorded 27 units in February, up from 18 units in January and marginally up from 26 units 12 months ago. Nissan Leaf accounted for 23 of the units for the month.
Although it was highlighted in the budget of 2018 that a preferential tariff would be provided for electric vehicles, volumes are yet to pick up.
In total, Sri Lanka saw 37, 354 vehicles being registered in February, down from 42, 783 units in January.

Trump ousts secretary of veterans affairs in cabinet shakeup
	

DPA, 29th MARCH, 2018- US President Donald Trump on Wednesday dismissed his secretary of veterans affairs, a move that had been expected for weeks amid a shakeup of personnel on Trumps team.
Trump announced in a tweet his intention to replace Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin, a medical doctor and former hospital executive, with White House doctor Ronny L Jackson. He thanked Shulkin for his service to the country and its veterans.
Jackson, a Navy admiral, was in the spotlight in January when he declared Trump fit for duty and mentally very sharp, very intact after conducting his first physical examination since taking office.
He has served as White House physician during the administrations of presidents George W Bush and Barack Obama, a White House statement said. After joining the Marines in 2005 he served in Iraq as an emergency doctor.
Shulkin, the only holdover from the Obama administration to join Trumps cabinet, appeared to lose favour with Trump when the Department of Veterans Affairs suffered a series of negative headlines.

Wax museum to host statues of politicos
	

A group of political authorities at provincial level has reportedly set their collective hearts on a novel project; to establish a wax museum.

The proposed museum is not to be a home for celebrities like eminent scientists, artistes or musicians, but for politicos. The project estimated to cost a whopping Rs.150 million has already raised eyebrows in many quarters, they say.
A powerful politico in the province is said to be behind this museum project. Plans are already underway to sculpt the figures of several prominent politicos, they say.

Why Is The Police Commission So Inefficient 
	
Especially the senior cadres of the commission and the senior police officers seem to be frustrated over the actions and intermediation of IGP Pujith Jayasundera
During these instances the Police Commission hadnt provided redress to the grievances of those affected
Everybody was puzzled as to how it was illegal to take into custody a lorry that was transporting timberwithout a permit
The Constitutional Council so appointed establishes the Police Commission in accordance with clause number 155 of the Constitution
As far as the law is concerned the Commission is answerable to the Parliament and not tothe Minister
Therefore the present Police Commission takes decisions regarding matters that cover grades above ASP


Law and Order has become the most controversial subject the Yahapalana Government has had to deal with for the past three years. Very recentlyA. Ranjith Madduma Bandara took over as Minister-Law and Order. 
When handing over this Ministry, which till then came under the purview of Ranil Wickremesinghe, to Bandara the Premier gave specific instructions to the new Minister to compile a report on the National Police Commission and its working.
The Premier had stated that the commission in the past had been gearing up only when there were shortcomings, which was due to the absence of a practical methodology. This statement by the Premier had led to a dialogue among legal experts on the Constitution and the legality of the Minister concerned having power to investigate into the affairs of an independent commission. 
However notwithstanding these factors there were many articles written on probing and exposing the activities of the Police Commission. Such articles on several occasions hitherto had failed to attract the attention of the commission. This revealed the lackadaisical attitude of the commission towards public complaints. 
This investigation is based on the situation that has arisen regarding the internal activities of the Commission which are now challenging its existence as an independent institution. 
The 19th Amendment to the Constitution empowers the Constitutional Council to appoint members to all other Commissions. The Constitutional Council chaired by the Speaker includes the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition as ex-officio members. On the recommendation of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, five members (two of whom are Parliamentarians) are appointed by the President. A Member of Parliament, not belonging to the political parties or independent groups which represent the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, but accepted jointly by other parties in the Parliament and appointed by the President is also included. The Constitutional Council so appointed establishes the Police Commission in accordance with clause number 155 of the Constitution. Accordingly the Police Comm
ission consists of seven members appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Constitutional Council. 
From the members appointed, one should be a retired police officer in the rank of a Deputy Inspector General of Police. The chairman of the Police Commission is appointed from among the members of the commission by the President on the recommendation of the Constitutional Council. 
The present Chairman of the Police Commission is P.H.Manatunge. The other members include Prof. Siri Hettige, Attorney Savithri D. Wijesekera, B.A. Jeyanathan, Y.L.M. Zavahir, Thilak Collure, and Dr Frank De Silva. 
The complaints that are received by the Police Commission includes Public Complaints on injustices caused to citizens by the police and injustices caused to the members of the Police Force by the Police. Even on an earlier occasion these writers had highlighted the same subject with regard to the injustices caused to the public. During these instances the Police Commission hadnt provided redress to the grievances of those affected. This time the report is on the injustice suffered by an Inspector of Police owing to a delay in the investigations regarding his appeal.
The Sub Inspector was acquitted of charges made against him. From that day the DIG concerned started taking revenge on the Sub Inspector
THE GRIEVANCE OF A 'COP' 
He had joined Sri Lanka Police as a Sub- Inspector and served in a number of police stations. On being promoted as an Inspector, and while serving as the OIC of a police station in the South, he had taken into custody a lorry transporting Timber without a permit. This was following a tip-off he had received. 
This incident was followed by a call from a DIG who had ordered him to release the stock of timber. As the investigations had already commenced under legal provisions, he had rejected the particular order and informed the incident to a Senior DIG, who in return instructed him to take appropriate legal action. Accordingly the suspects were produced in courts. 
Just a few days passed and the Sub Inspector was arrested by a team of police officers on charges of illegally taking into custody a lorry transporting timber. Everybody was puzzled as to how it was illegal to take into custody a lorry that was transporting timber without a permit. The owner of the lorry had shown a permit later which appeared to have been obtained after the lorry was taken into custody. 
The Sub Inspector was produced in courts and during the hearing the evidence proved that the Sub Inspector had taken the lorry into custody legally. The Sub Inspector had mentioned in his statement that he had obtained confirmation from the officers at the Divisional Secretariat that a permit hadnt been issued for the lorry to transport timber at the time of the arrest. The Sub Inspector was acquitted of charges made against him. From that day the DIG concerned started taking revenge on the Sub Inspector. He was deprived of promotions and under the tenure of the present IGP he was demoted to the grade of Inspector from the grade of Chief Inspector. All these maneuvres were made even without a basic inquiry. He lodged a complaint with the Police Commission and his appeal was held back for more than one and half years. The reason given for this was that the IGPs report hadnt been received. Meanwhile the IGP had taken steps to frame bogus charges and terminate his services from the department of police. The police officer concerned took steps to make an appeal. This too dragged on for more than one and half years. However he didnt give up. Despite being frustrated he continued in his pursuit of resorting to legal avenues. After two years he returned to his job and was reinstated in the post of Chief Inspector. The administrative authority had ordered that the officer be assigned the post of ASP. However he has not received the increments that he was denied of. 
He had made another appeal in this regard and one year has lapsed without him receiving a reply. It is not worth when a period spanning one to two years of an individuals life is filled with anguish. Such individuals await in vain hoping for a response; something that would never see the light of day. Who is to blame in this regard Why have commissions if the grieved parties are forced to waste time 
This is only one story, but there are many similar episodes kept in abeyance for want of space.
The Police Commission meets regularly every Thursday. The appeals taken up at the last meeting were postponed
 
MOTIVE DERAILED 
What we are trying to infer is that the motive behind the establishment of the Police Commission appears to be derailed, humiliating the members of the police. Especially the senior cadres of the commission and the senior police officers seem to be frustrated over the actions and intermediation of IGP Pujith Jayasundera in the decision making of the Police Commission. The IGP isnt a member of this commission and therefore he has no voting power at the meetings of the commission. He has the right to attend the meetings as outlined by the Constitution Council. According to internal sources the IGP is appearing to be misusing this right to attend the meetings. 
The quorum at these meetings is four. Decisions are taken based on the majority vote and at any crucial time the individual who chairs the meeting has the right of a decisive vote. Internal sources also reveal that though the IGP has no vote his behaviour underscores there was interference on his part in voting in arriving at certain decisions. 
This has resulted in the delay of responding to appeals. The Police Commission meets regularly every Thursday. The appeals taken up at the last meeting were postponed. They had said that the appeals would be subject to further reconsideration. The main reason was the non-submission of reports by the IGP in relation to these appeals. Few examples are: Number 2885/91/29 June/2017 SI G. Wilfred Silva, number3367/112/09th November/2017PC 46919 H.M. Gamini. Ranasinghe, 3504/115/30th November/201/PC C.M. Ransinghe, number 2475//89/ 20th June/2017 SI S.M.S. Sisira, number 2485/89/20th June/2017 Police Inspector U.W. Senevirathne, number2574/91/ 29th June/2017 PC S. Nimal Shantha, number 2892/100/24th August/2017 Police Inspector Sivaraman Shivakumar, number 3208/107/ 04th October/2017 and 3705/119 SI K.L.G. Pushpakumara Perera.
AUTHORITY VESTED ON THE IGP
The Police Commission could confer on a committee its powers and authority on disciplinary matters and transfers or promotions of Police Officers in grades identified by the commission according to the Constitution. Therefore the present Police Commission takes decisions regarding matters that cover grades above ASP. This authority is again vested with the IGP by a Gazette notification. This limits the number of appointments and promotions that now come under the ambit of the Commission to about 3000 out of a number of above 80,000.
From among them 3000 senior police officers who are second only to the IGP made an appeal to the Commission to take over the administration of the Police Department. The Police Special Investigation Unit established to inquire into the wrong doings of police officers has now become a cats paw, used by interested parties to facilitate their own private agendas. This fact was stated before the Commission by senior DIGs themselves. Even then it appears that this Commission is yet to understand its priorities. Therefore its evident that a group of senior officers are contemplating complaining directly to the Constitutional Council shortly. 
They are also getting ready to bring to the notice of the Council, the telephone calls that are being made to a senior person of the Commission, by a powerful Minister. 
Meanwhile a group of permanent employees of the Police Commission had also addressed a petition to the Auditor General, requesting for a justifiable investigation on the administration and finance control of the Police Commission. They allege that the Commission appointed under the 19th amendment to the Constitution had failed to achieve its objectives and charge that the Commission has now turned into a white Elephant, devouring public funds. 
The Police Special Investigation Unit established to inquire into the wrong doings of police officers has now become a cats paw, used by interested parties to facilitate their own private agendas

MONEY WASTED ON RENT 
They further charge that by unnecessarily renting out a number of rooms at the BMICH, a colossal sum of money is spent monthly as rent. Some rooms obtained on rent are used only for short periods of time. At the time of the establishment of this Commission, in 2015, there were only 25 staff members. The staff now exceeds100. The appeal boards are also in an unsatisfactory state. Its apparent at a glance that most of these appeals are likely to get rejected as many have lapsed and some of the victims have left the service. 
Its evident that the powers of the commission, its objectives and in setting out operations had all gone haywire. As far as the law is concerned the Commission is answerable to the Parliament and not to the Minister. The Annual Reports of its working are compiled on that basis. Our sister paper had on many occasions pointed out the serious lapses of the Commission, but they failed to wake up the authorities from deep slumber. 

Its pertinent to mention that UN Activists on a recent tour to the island held a press briefing and stressed that the Police Commission is not stable. Ose Guvera, a member of the group, emphasized that arbitrary detentions and torture by the police should have drawn the attention of the Commission and they should strengthen the procedure in conducting investigations into such matters. This newspaper is only striving to depict only a single profile of the Police Commission. 
The above foreign activists collected much details during their stay, which lasted 11 days, in the island, and expected to present their findings to the UNHRC at their sessions scheduled for September. 
If the authorities are really keen on this matter they have another five months to pull their socks up! 

IGP was summoned and instructions were given
According to Media spokesperson of the Police Commission 
G.D. Liyanarachchi the delay in receiving reports from the police was a matter that has been present for some time. We directed the attention of the Police Commission to this issue. Accordingly we sent reminders from time to time. Finally we summoned the IGP and after a discussion suggested a definite date before which the relevant reports should be sent. We discussed this matter with the DIGs too. We will continue to strive in obtaining these reports from the IGP without any delay said Liyanarachchi. 
NO REPLY TO THE INFORMATION SOUGHT
Many individuals claim that when requests are made to obtain information from the Police Commission that there is no reply. With the intention of obtaining veracity, we too directed a request for information from the Police Commission to which too there wasnt a reply. When an inquiry was made over the phone the reply was that the request has been received. After having waited for nearly a month, another inquiry was made, to which the reply was that if information had not been received the grieved parties should make an appeal. An information officers duty is to reveal the information and not to hide it. If they are unable to provide the information requested for they should accept this inability in writing. But it appears that it is not relevant to the Police Commission. An appeal was submitted in writing to the mentioned officer of the Police Commission, but there was no reply till this edition went to print.

## Title: World Autism Awareness Day When parents play the role of therapist

World Autism Awareness Day When parents play the role of therapist
	

April 2nd is named as World Autism Awareness Day with the view of spreading awareness and sensitizing people about the brain disorder. An international campaign Light It Up Blue is observed on this day. However, knowledge of Autism in Sri Lankans is still limited. Here, in this report, we will be discussing what Autism is, its causative factors, complications and so on. 

What type of a disorder is Autism
Autism is a disorder associated with brain development. In a patient who has autism there are abnormalities in connectivity and the function of nerves in some parts of the brain. 

How do you identify Autism
Autism is characterized by a triad of features i.e. difficulties with social connectedness, difficulties in communication and repetitive and restricted interests and activities. Difficulties in social connectedness is seen as; poor eye contact, not showing interest in people, not pointing to things that they are interested in, not looking at where the parents are pointing at, preferring isolation, not imitating others and the absence of greeting gestures like waving goodbye. 
The feature parents notice most in such people and worry about most is the difficulties they have in communicating. These difficulties include speech delay and other verbal and non-verbal communication abnormalities. By the time they reach one year most of the children would have started babbling which is commonly known as baby talk and by 6 months a baby should use at least a few meaningful single words when communicating. However, a child with Autism may not show these developments. By 24 months babies are able to communicate using two-word sentences, but this may not be seen in babies with Autism. Some babies with Autism start speech appropriately, but then lose this ability between 1  - 3 years of age. Yet another group of children with Autism starts speech development normally, but it will not progress as expected and they will lag behind in speech development. Sometimes, these children show parroting in speech. They repeat what others say or what they heard on the radio or TV. 
Children with autism also show a restricted and repetitive pattern of interests and activities. For example, a child developing normally will be interested in a variety of toys, but their liking will be limited to one or very few toys. Even with those toys they do not play appropriately. Children with Autism will not play appropriately with toys. Instead of pulling or pushing the toy car they will just stare at rotating wheels. They do not imitate the actions of others or facial expressions or do not pretend they are playing ; like feeding or bathing a doll. 
The IQ level of children with autism can range from very superior to normal to poor or very poor. 

Causes and treatments for Autism
Up to now a definite cause hasnt been identified. However, it has been found that genes play a big role in Autism. In addition some adverse conditions during pregnancy, childbirth and early period after childbirth and adverse environmental conditions may also play a role in Autism. 
The main modes of treatment are therapies. These include occupational and speech therapy. Speech therapy is used to improve social connectedness and communication and Occupational therapy mainly targets the social connectedness and restricted and repetitive interests and activities.
Medications are used only to manage behaviour problems like aggression and self-mutilating behaviours. 

Parental responsibility
Trained therapists in hospitals teach parents therapies to be used for their child. The parents will be the main therapists for their children. It is the responsibility of parents to learn and practise these therapies with their child as advised. 

How common is Autism
Autism is found to be on the rise. About 30 years ago Autism was relatively a rare disorder with a prevalence of 1in 2000 children. About 8 years back Prof. Hemamali Perera did a survey on Autism and found that in Sri Lanka about 1 in 93 children have Autism. At present 1 in 68 children has autism worldwide. This increase may be the result of a true increase of the illness and result of increased awareness in the community. 

Can Autism be identified during pregnancy
Autism cant be diagnosed antenatally. However, if a family already has a child with the risk of autism, the potential for their next child to be born with this condition is greater when compared to a family that doesnt have a trace of this history. From around six months of age children may show red flag signs of Autism. If you are concern about the development of the child, it is better to go to the nearest Government hospital and get the opinion of a specialist. 

Common myths about Autism
Autism is four times commoner in boys than in girls. Our society believes that boys start speech later than girls and therefore do not seek medical advice and wait until the child is about 2-3 years of age. Sometimes people attribute the delay in speech to bad times or planetary influence and do not seek medical advice until quite late.
