20A- Will talk to Prez, PM after they reveal their stance: JVP
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said today they would discuss the 20th Amendment with the President and the Prime Minister only after they revealed their stance on abolishing the executive presidency.
He told a news conference that the JVP needed the support of 150 MPs in Parliament to get this approved and added that President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and former president Mahinda Rajapaksa should advise their parliamentarians to support this Bill.
"We are ready to have talks with anyone regarding the 20A. We have only six members in Parliament but we need 150 votes to get the Bill approved. The President and the Prime Minister and former president Rajapaksa have repeatedly pledged to abolish the executive presidency. We dont see any point in asking them whether they are willing to abolish it. We will talk to them only about the 20A after they reveal their stance," he said.
Mr. Dissanayake said they had organized seminars with university lecturers, artistes, journalists, civil society groups and professionals to discuss the 20A
"We dont see the 20A as a final document. We are ready to talk with anyone regarding this. We are ready to talk with the Buddhist monks who were against this Bill if they pointed out the matters leading to the division of the country," he said.
Referring to the draft of the 20A, he said the Bill proposed to scrap the extreme powers of the President and assign most of the powers to the Prime Minister, Cabinet and Parliament.
However, the President under the 20A will retain powers vested on him by the 13th Amendment. His powers on the Public Security Ordinance to declare State of Emergency will also be intact. He cannot dissolve Parliament or prorogue it according to 20A, Mr. Dissanayake said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Colombia heads for divisive runoff with peace deal at stake
	

REUTERS, 28th MAY, 2018 - Colombia headed for its most divisive presidential race in decades after right-winger Ivan Duque won Sundays first-round vote, triggering a runoff with leftist Gustavo Petro that could upset a historic peace deal or derail business friendly reforms.
It is the first time in Colombias modern history that an openly leftist candidate has reached the second round of a presidential vote, a prospect that unnerved some investors in Latin Americas fourth largest economy. (Graphic on Latin American elections)
Duque, a 41-year-old former official of the Washington-based InterAmerican Development Bank, was the convincing winner of Sundays ballot with 39 percent of votes, ahead of Petro, an outspoken ex-mayor of Bogota, with 25 percent, broadly in line with polls.

Country could face epidemic if flu not controlled
	
Doctors of the Karapitiya Hospital said yesterday warned that influenza that had blighted much of the the Southern Province could spread to other parts of the country unless steps are taken to contain it.
Dr. Janith Liyanage head of the GMOA Karapitiya Hospital branch said that this would lead to a lack of specialists, medical equipment and bed space at Intensive Care Units across the country, putting a severe strain on the medical service.
Dr. Liyanage further stated, Only the Karapitiya hospital has an Intensive Care Unit for children in the Southern Province, and even this unit has only seven beds. More beds can be placed on the upper floor of the building to accommodate more patients but the government has to urgently look into this need and take action. The ICU is fully occupied by influenza patients at present. This means there is no room to treat children suffering from illnesses such as cancer, kidney ailments and heart related ailments. There are only four ICU's for children in the entire country, which is a big problem. It takes about 12 hours to clean out a bed after a patient gets discharged in order to get it ready for another. Additionally there are only two specialist doctors for the childen's ICU at the Karapitiya hospital. There are only ten such doctors in the country.
Due to the hospital overflowing with influenza patients there is no way to admit patients who need urgent medical attention for other ailments, he complained, adding that while influenza has now escalated to epidemic proportions the authorities are strangely silent on this aspect.
Joint Secretary of the GMOA branch Dr. Kanchitha Samararatne said that it was wrong to presume that the disease had been contained merely because of a drop in the number of patients being admitted. "The media has dealt with the spread of the disease extensively.
However, there are pluses and minuses involved in it. One of the bad ones is that people are now resorting to getting themselves admitted to private hospitals as a result of government hospitals getting full because of the panic that has set in. All the private hospitals in the Galle District are full today. This disease is contagious and spreads by coming into contact with the secretions of patients. It is important to stop too many visitors to see these patients. Those who do visit a patient should be extremely careful to take precautions such as covering one's face with a face mask or a handkerchief in order to minimise the risk of contracting the disease," he advised.(Sirangika Loku Karawita, Premathilake de Silva and D.G.Sugathapala)

Doubts over a death
	
	Family urges for reasonable relief, not blood money as in Rizanas incident
	
	
	The employer says Priyanka was shot dead by a mentally unstable person; family says she never talked about such a person in the house
	

A mother, who engaged in an employment ambitiously to bring prosperity to her family ultimately destined to arrive in the country in a coffin, after being a target of gunshot of a mentally retarded Saudi Arabian national.
She was Priyanka of Katumburawa, Wanduramba, Galle.
She married Upul, 22 years ago and they became loving parents of three daughters.
When died, Priyanka Jayasekera was 38, while her husband Lelwala Guruge Upul is 48.
Their elder daughter Chamila Asiri (21) is now married and a mother. Her second daughter Amitha Keshani (12) a grade eight student at the Urala Vidyalaya and youngest, Nethmi Pamodya (08) is in Grade three of the same school.
As the children were growing, the young couple thought of a good future for their children- to educate them well and build a house.
About nine years ago, Priyanka was offered to go for employment abroad with the blessing of her husband, with the hope to usher in a better future for the children.
On May 12th Upuls phone rang, knowing it was a foreign number, he anxiously began to speak to his wife. But from the other end he was told it was not Priyanka. The voice demanded: Withdraw the complaint made to the Foreign Employment Bureau.
Stunned Upul asked:
Why
The other end repeated the same demand.

"On May 12th Upuls phone rang. Knowing it was a foreign number, he anxiously began to speak to his wife but from the other end he was told it was not Priyanka..."
Madam might have withdrawn the complaint by now, Upul replied.
There are doubts about the official version on the death of Priyanka.
However, the Saudi Police reported that Priyankas death had been caused by a gunshot fired by a mentally unstable man.
According to a statement of the Saudi Embassy Priyanka had died after being shot by the mentally retarded 31-year-son of the household.
Foreign media reports said that the domestic aide was killed with a gun used for hunting
Her body was brought to the Al Ras Hospital in Saudi Arabia. The gunman also had shot himself.
Whether the suspect is actually mentally retarded or not, can one believe the official version of that country
These doubts linger over her death.
Whatever the cause of death, it is a loss of a kind mother of three daughters and an affectionate wife to a husband.
My wifes death left us helpless. I earn for the sustenance of our family with hard labour. What she earned working in a foreign country, is some relief for our family. But now she had left us in misery, Upul said.
Priyankas body has not been sent yet. It is likely to come after few months.
Upul said that he had appealed to the Ministers and officials to intervene and take actions to punish the murderer and to compel relevant officials for compensation for the children.
The Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau (SLFEB) said that procedures related to foreign employment services had been now improved to a satisfactory level.
But still, thousands of Sri Lankans are subject to harassment and abuse at the hands of their employers in the Middle East.
Priyanka of Wanduramba seems to be another victim of such abuse.

Floods, Landslides, Disasters and Corruption - EDITORIAL
	
re-monsoonal rains by May 26 have resulted in 16 deaths and 138,292 persons from 35,129 families being displaced. The monsoon proper has not even commenced, but the number of deaths and displaced continue to rise 
According to the Disaster Management Centre, in May 2016, 301,602 people were affected by the floods and landslides. 104 people died and 99 people went missing. 
An estimated 623 houses were destroyed and 4,414 damaged. Due to a landslide in Aranayake, in the Kegalle District which devastated three villages, at least 104 people are known to have died and 99 reported missing. 
In the aftermath of the floods in May 2016, media reports quoted Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe and then Finance Minister Ravi Karunaratne, as saying affected persons would be compensated through disaster insurance which the government purchased the previous year. 
Unfortunately though government officials visited affected homes and entire villages which were badly damaged, drew up lists of the quantum of damages incurred, most of the the victims of the May 2016 flood still await the promised compensation for the damage they suffered. 
A year later, in May 2017, according to statistics provided by the Red Cross and the UN, over half-a-million million people were de-housed after two days of incessant rain, with 46 deaths reported in Ratnapura alone. By 21 June that year, according to UN estimates 415,600 people were affected. A total of 213 deaths were confirmed and 76 people remained missing. Over 3,000 houses were destroyed, 21,000 partially damaged. Over 3,400 people remained temporarily displaced even after the floods subsided. 
According to the Disaster Management Centre 213 people died as a result of flooding and landslides caused by heavy rainfall and strong monsoon winds that hit on May 25 and 26, 2017. 
The worst damage has been taking place in the hilly areas of the country as a result of landslides. 
Landslides are not new to this country. Statistics over the past two years show ever increasing numbers of deaths, damage to house and numbers of people displaced. Yet again on May 20 this year, the National Building Research Organization (NBRO) issued a landslide warning for districts of Kalutara, Kegalle, Nuwara Eliya, Badulla, Kurunegala, and Galle - the hilly regions of the country. Landslides keep occurring with monotonous regularity, year-in-and-year-out . 
Much of the hill country was heavily deforested to make way for export crops such as tea and rubber, leaving the near treeless hillsides exposed to possible landslides. The NBRO has pointed out that 4/5th of landslides occur due to continuing human activity. 
While villages in hilly areas have been subjected to landslides during the monsoon seasons, city dwellers and those living in sub-urban areas too have on an annual basis been subject to flooding 
Back in May 2016, the Acting Director-General of the Irrigation Department pointed out a major contributory factor to floods in the city has been the filling of marshlands for development purposes, shrinking open spaces, illegal constructions, the lack of proper waste disposal and inefficient drainage systems. 
A government survey in 2006 shows 54% (647,100 persons) of Colombo citys population live in slums; in illegal constructions. Most of these shanty dwellings are built up in low-lying areas which get flooded during heavy rains, a result of migration from villages, in search of employment in Colombo. With the low status afforded to agricultural workers and the poor economic returns for their labour, even today, more and more people keep coming to the urban centres to better their economic prospects and social standing. 
Many of these unfortunate people end up in the city slums in overcrowded dwellings and some of which are built beside canals, or river banks on state-owned highway/railway reservation lands. 
The 2006 survey found that 43,462 families in Colombo do not have access to clean drinking water. The shanties often suffer from inadequate drainage and accumulated garbage. The majority of the residents do not have any form of solid waste collection service. 
The solution to the problem of landslides in the hill country districts and flooding in the urban areas, calls for massive tree-planting programmes and planned storied housing in the urban areas. But the government has insufficient funds to implement such programmes. Corruption on a massive scale drains funds which could be used for these purposes into private pockets. 
Unless stern action is taken to root out the unbridled corruption taking place in the country, there is little chance that the cause of landslides or flooding could be tackled in the foreseeable future.

Gammanpila challenges Anura for public debate on 20A
	
While claiming that the 20th amendment to the constitution had been drafted in an immature manner and full of mistakes, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader and MP Udaya Gammanpila challenged Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) leader Anura Kumara for a public debate to point out the shortcomings of the draft.
According to the draft, the executive Presidency would be abolished on January 09, 2020. The term of the present president will end on January 09, 2020. Hence, the next presidential election should be held on a date between November 9 and December 9, 2019, he said in a news briefing.
The newly elected president will have two weeks to take his oaths. It means he can assume office on December 23, 2019. The executive presidency will be abolished in 16 days after the newly elected president assumes office. Why should we waste billions of Rupees of public funds for a presidential election if the president can hold the office only for 16 days he asked. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

GMOA condemns Thewarapperuma's unruly behaviour
	
The GMOA today condemned the alleged conduct of Deputy Minister Palitha Thewarapperuma who had sabotaged a disaster preparedness programme being conducted at the Galewela District Hospital.
GMOA Secretary Haritha Aluthge said Sri Lanka was a climate risk country as reported in the media, and the country would experience more and more natural disasters in future and as such it was essential to carry out such awareness programmes.
He said it was inappropriate for the deputy minister to forcibly enter the Galewela hospital and disrupt the programme organized by the Disaster Management Ministry.
The deputy minister has disrupting the duties of public servants lawfully involved in the programme, Dr. Aluthge said and urged the government to inquire into this incident.
Meanwhile, the GMOA requested Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to hold a workshop to educate parliamentarians on how to act when faced with a disaster situation.
It said Deputy Minister Palitha Thewarapperumas unruly behaviour during a disaster preparedness rehearsal at the Galewela District Hospital on Friday was a bad precedent to all public representatives.
Dr. Aluthge said apart from the public the MPs should also know about handling a disaster situation.
Yahapalana was brought to end an administration where government servants were tied to trees and and made to kneel down. Such a dark age cannot let repeated, he said.
GMOA also criticized Minister Duminda Dissanayake for apologizing to Deputy Minister Thewarapperuma for the incident.
What made Minister Duminda apologise to Thewarapperuma. It should have been the other way round, he added.
Dr. Aluthge warned the deputy minister to keep his business out of the health sector or he will face the consequence. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Hands thae heal: Pharmacists in dilemma
	

	The purchase of drugs is completely different from purchasing goods at a supermarket
	
	
	The pharmacist is medically responsible to the patient and legally responsible to the Government
	

The subject of studying, preparing, formulating, dispensing and storing medicine is often referred to as Pharmacy.
The Pharmacy is also the place where drugs are stored under proper storage conditions and put up for sale, according to the rules and regulations imposed by the Government under the drug ordinance.
Earlier, doctors used to prescribe mixtures, powders and gargles to be prepared by the Pharmacist. The role of the Pharmacist was important back in the day, when Pharmacists took great care in dispensing drugs to the ill.
But at present a majority of the medicines are prepared and ready to use, and are manufactured under the precision and care of large scale drug manufacturers.
Many drugs that are now being imported as one generic drug, under various trade or brand names, which is more than necessary.
Attractive display of drugs
It is quite apparent that in some pharmacies, owners or proprietors embrace luxury and attraction when storing drugs.
Drugs are displayed attractively in some medical practices similar to the products displayed in supermarkets, in an attempt to lure consumers.
Pharmacists however are required to store and dispense drugs according to the rules and regulations in the Cosmetic Devices and Drugs Act.
Drugs are to be stored only under its appropriate storage conditions.
For instance insulin preparations are to be stored between the temperatures of 2 C to 8 C to avoid freezing, while Amoxicillin capsules are to be stored in amber coloured glass bottles or plastic containers, preventing exposure to sunlight and moisture.
What we observe in most pharmacies, is however a different situation. The attractive display and storage of drugs results in enriching a commercial background for numerous brand names to overpopulate the market.
This incessant import of one generic drug under different brand names is in fact due to the great demand shown by the public as a result of doctors prescribing these brand names. Little do the consumers realise that theres a silent danger in this practice.
Dispensing dangerous drugs
While pharmacists have adopted similar measures as salesmen to persuade customers to purchase drugs, it is imperative that the consumer knows that the purchase of drugs is completely different from purchasing goods at a supermarket.
When a patient is prescribed a certain drug by a doctor, there is absolutely no need for the patient to be attracted to the drug.
There is no need for the drugs to be advertised or for the pharmacist to persuade patients to buy drugs at all. It is simply an act of the pharmacist dispensing the drugs in the prescription.
Drugs must be dispensed according to the following schedule
Malpractices among pharmacists
Pharmacists are not businessmen or salesmen. He or she is an authorised person to dispense drugs according to the Act.
As such, this is a profession of great responsibility. A pharmacist must enter into record all details of each drug he dispenses. This record should be made available to the food and drug inspectors at any given time.
There are two types of Pharmacies in Sri Lanka. In the first, the pharmacist is the proprietor of the pharmacy. In others, the proprietor of the Pharmacy is not a registered pharmacist and therefore has to seek the services of a qualified pharmacist, who is registered with the Sri Lanka Medical Council.
However, it is with the latter that most problems have been reported from.
There have been reports of some proprietors forcing pharmacists to dispense drugs, against the schedule, with the hope of reaping economic benefits. This is clearly illegal.
The pharmacist is the person who will be indicted or prosecuted in the event a patient is harmed by the issue of an incorrect drug.
Therefore proprietors have no right to dictate terms to the pharmacist. The pharmacist is medically responsible to the patient and legally responsible to the Government.
Some pharmacy owners are absolutely business minded. They are eager only to develop their pharmacy in terms of profit, even if it caused harm to patients.
If a pharmacist refuses to dispense any drug to a patient, it is usually for the patients own good. Some proprietors, who want to build a network of returning customers, tend to issue schedule 2B drugs on oral request, with a view to reinforce the commercial stability of the pharmacy.
Pharmacists should maintain their professional conduct at all times even if he is forced by the proprietors in some establishments.

Indictment on the Judiciary  by Suganthika Fernando
	

The critical comments made by the Attorney-at-Law Suganthika Fernando on the conduct of a judicial officer and the happenings at Marawila Magistrates Court should prompt us to take a realistic and dispassionate look at the whole judicial process of this country. Her allegations which are of serious nature would have tremendous negative impact on the image of the whole judicial system. Therefore in fairness to all those who are involved in the judicial process without rejecting her allegations outright, I would urge that a fair and impartial inquiry be held to determine the truthfulness or otherwise of the allegations made. 
In any realistic appraisal of the judicial system, we cannot overlook its shortcomings and weaknesses. Therefore in the light of the critical comments made by her, the following considerations are clearly warranted. 
Today, we live in an age when all our traditional institutions are under close scrutiny and attack. In an age when our traditional institutions are under close surveillance by the media and the members of the public, only a rational and dispassionate appreciation of how our judicial system works can protect its integrity and survival of the system which we have nurtured and developed over several centuries. 
It must be admitted that the Judges today unlike in the past, live and work in full glare of publicity and is no longer immune from constructive and reasonable criticism by the members of public and media. As any other institution, the judicial institution and the men who work it are critically watched, observed and assailed by the members of the public and the media. Their decisions and judgements are subject to scrutiny, analysis and evaluation by them. Therefore, it is of paramount importance that nothing should be done to diminish the prestige of the judicial system. 
It cannot be said that criticism levelled against some aspects of the judicial system are unjustified, as Judges are not infallible and they are not beyond reproach. It is said that justice is not cloistered virtue and she must be allowed to suffer the scrutiny and outspoken comments of the ordinary men who are interested in the system. (Lord Atkin in Ambard vs. Attorney General of Trinidad and Tobago 1936 AC 322 at 335). 

	The Judges today unlike in the past, live and work in full glare of publicity
	
	
	Criticism levelled against some aspects of the judicial system are unjustified
	

This country is still blessed with distinguished tradition of judicial independence and excellence and our judicial system has inbuilt qualities of objectivity, independence and impartiality. If the public is to retain their confidence in the judicial process, nothing should be done to undermine its credibility. 
The confidence placed by the public in the judicial system and its process is the most precious asset. The forfeiture of that confidence will inevitably lead to the end of the ordered society. 
It is in the lower courts that the citizens most often have contacts with the judiciary. From the moment an accused is presented to court by the police, until final determination of the case the accused faces the Judge whenever decisions affecting his life and future are made. 
It is there that the public form their first impression of the whole judicial process. Public impression of the whole system is moulded and shaped to a great extent by the conduct and the demeanour of the Judge. Lord Denning observed When a Judge sits to try a case, he himself on trial before his fellow men, Therefore it is on his conduct and behaviour that they will form their own opinion about the system of justice prevailing in the country. It is the Judge who must bring honour to the seat of justice. The quality of justice depends greatly on the quality of those who dispense it. As the American Jurist Benjamin Cardozo once observed in the long run, there is no guarantee of justice except the personality of the Judge.
When the workings of the Magistrates Courts are examined it would be evident that there are extreme variations and differences between their own practices and that of others. There are in fact considerable variations in the way different magistrates use their authority and powers. 

	The quality of justice depends greatly on the quality of those who dispense it
	
	
	Judges should display some degree of rationality and coherence in the orders they make
	
Even within the same court vast disparities and differences are seen in such matters as sentencing and approach to bail applications. People assume that the law is something that is clear cut and the remedies applicable to violations are clearly laid down. When we really look at the workings of Magistrate courts it becomes clear to us that this assumption that the law in a given situation is clearly laid down is completely erroneous and misconceived. For some judges most of the law is a matter of discretion and discretion is whatever they think is right. Even authoritative decisions handed down by some of our eminent judges of the superior courts are of little relevance to them. Substantive and procedural law are also of little significance to them. 
In this connection, I am reminded of the great American legal realist Karl Llewellyn who observed in his writings the theory that rules decide cases seems for centuries to have fooled not only library ridden recluses, but Judges. He believed that the focal point of legal research should be shifted from the study of rules to the observances of real behaviour of law officials particularly of Judges. 
Jerome Frank another radical realist in his writings argued that judicial decisions are conditioned by emotion prejudices, tempers and other irrational factors and the knowledge of substantive and prescriptive law would be of little help in predicting the decision of a particular Judge. He further observed no one knows the law about any case with respect to any given situation, transaction or event until there has been a specific decision with regard thereto. For him what the Judges do in court is the law. Therefore it is evident that the assumption that the law is something that is clearly laid down and remedies applicable in a given situation in belied by their own conduct and practices. It is true that comparisons of cases and offences may be difficult as facts in one may be dissimilar to another case. Disparities and lack of uniformity in the orders made by Judges can be justified as long they are within the parameters of the law and based on strictly legal criteria. But it is important that Judges should display some degree of rationality and coherence in the orders they make. 
As far as the bail system in many magistrate courts is concerned it should be stated that it is far from the ideal. Purpose of bail is to ensure the presence of suspect in court to answer the charges and submit to trial. In matters concerning bail Criminal Procedure Code and other laws relating to bail now govern what should be done to a suspect awaiting trial in court. 
Despite the general rule which strongly favours pre-trial release pending trial setting unattainable and excessive bail which suspects cannot afford even in circumstances where they could be released on their own recognizance is an abusive judicial practice some Judges resort to in order to make them plead guilty to charges which sometimes they did not commit. Although a great weight is traditionally attached to the fundamental principle of the presumption of innocence some Judges often seem to be guided and influenced by the principle of guilt in the process of making orders from the time a suspect is presented to court. For them what the police say is the gospel truth. 
Corruption and perception of corruption in court is also an enduring problem. It is pervasive and none can deny that corruption and other irregular practices exist in the field of office administration in courts. It must be remembered that judges functions are not primarily concerned with presiding over courts but their work extends to other parts of judicial process such as administration of the office work. Therefore, it is their responsibility to see that corruption and other irregular practices are completely eliminated or at least minimised in their courts.as it leads to the erosion of the public confidence of the whole judicial process. 
Criticisms have also been levelled against certain Judges for the use of inelegant inappropriate and abrasive language in the course of judicial proceedings. Judges should treat all parties equally with utmost courtesy and they should be restrained in their speech when addressing lawyers and other litigants before them. It has to be remembered that use of unrestrained language by a Judge in judicial proceedings tends to diminish fairness and effectiveness of judicial process. In the course of judicial proceedings, a Judge may honestly err which is pardonable, but he should not consciously and deliberately deviate from the correct path. 
Finally, in regard to the critical comments made by the attorney, I must state I can neither discount nor accept what she uttered in regard to the conduct of the judicial officer or the alleged happenings at this particular court, as I was not an eye witness to the incident, which can only be proven at an impartial and fair inquiry. 
My primary objective in writing this is neither to castigate the judiciary as a whole nor even to impugn the conduct of a particular Judge. I write this solely in the interest of an institution, which we have nurtured and preserved for generations.

JHU opposed to 20A: Champika
	
The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) said today it was opposed to the 20th Amendment to the Constitution presented by the Janatha Vimuthi Peramuna (JVP) and pointed out that such a move would unstabilise the country and be a threat to democracy.
JHU General Secretary and Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka told a news conference that they were opposed to Constitutional Amendments in a piecemeal manner.
The Prime Minister is proposed to be the Head of State in the 20th Amendment proposed by the JVP. A similar provision was included in the 19th Amendment originally. But, the Supreme Court struck it off. The Supreme Court ruled it needed approval of people by referendum, he said.
Mr. Ranawaka said the 20A had been proposed to abolish executive presidency without reforming the current electoral system and other related matters. Therefore, he said it would lead to instability in the country in politics, posing a threat to democracy.
He said they were ready to study and support if anyone introduced a new constitution along with a fresh electoral system enabling a stable Parliament to be formed. (Ajith Siriwardana)

My father liked to watch my matches with the fans: Dhananjaya reminisces
	
Test cricketer Dhananjaya de Silva said that his father, who was gunned down, was the person that encouraged him and was most satisfied by the progress he had in his cricketing career. He said his father was an avid cricket fan who liked to view matches while sitting among fans.
"With the loss of my father, I feel like I have lost what I loved most in life," he said.
Dhananjaya's father, Dehiwala Mount Lavinia Municipal Council (DMMC) member K. Ranjan de Silva, was shot dead an unidentified group of persons who had arrived in a motor vehicle at his home in Ratmalana on Thursday (24) night. Police said Mr. de Silva had sustained 12 shots to the body fired by a T-56 machine gun.
Two other injured persons had been admitted to the South Colombo Teaching hospital but their condition was not serious according to Dr. Asela Gunawardene.
Unable to contain his grief at the sudden loss of his father, Dhananjaya said, "Whatever he did, my father gave priority to us, his three sons. He watched my matches with great pleasure. I was busy because I was getting ready for the West Indies tour. I met him only two days before his death. Upon hearing that my father was shot, I rushed to the hospital. By the time I got there he was no more", he cried.(Reka Tharangani Fonseka and H.M.Dharmapala)

Despite its youth, TSG has remained focused on building a strong culture based on its core values of: Care, Commitment, Integrity, Innovation, and Excellence. This has allowed the team to rapidly adapt and grow as it scaled. It is not just the companys age, Third Space Globals workforce too is unusually young, with an average employee age of 23.3 years.

Third Space Global continues to break with tradition as female staff represent 62% of the workforce. This figure is nearly twice that of the disappointing 36% female representation in the national labour force  the successes and challenges of which were discussed by Countess Sophie during her recent visit to Sri Lanka. TRH Prince Edward and the Countess also visited Third Space Global during their February trip.
Ms. Ratnayaka also commented on how exciting it is for Sri Lanka to have Third Space Global provide education services to the UK in such an innovative method. Currently, Third Space Global is the only company in the world that delivers one-to-one Maths online teaching to a state school education sector. By working directly with the schools, TSG are able to work with at-risk children who need extra support, thus allowing TSG to pursue its social mission We seek social change by cultivating a global community of the most ambitious talent to make effective online teaching more accessible than ever before.

For Roshan Nilaweera, this award is deserving recognition of the staff and culture at TSG. Going forward, Third Space Global intends to build upon this success by expanding its CSR programmes in collaboration with Sri Lankas Department of Education as well as Commercial Bank whilst also looking at the development of a new technology platform to create jobs and opportunities across the whole of Sri Lanka.

For years, the British Council Colombo Library has challenged the traditional perception of a library. While being home to the best selection of books and learning resources in Colombo the venue is also well known as a gathering space for artists, thinkers and thought leaders. On Sunday 3 June, the British Council Library will reopen as a space that embodies this role it plays as both a repository of knowledge and convener of people and ideas. To celebrate, an open day will present an exciting programme of events that capture the librarys vibe- It all happens here!
The British Council is the UKs international organisation for cultural relations and education opportunities. In Sri Lanka, they have been active for almost seven decades in the spaces of English language education, education and society, and the arts. The British Council Library is an extension of its commitment to these three pillars; with over 25,000 Sri Lankan members and centres in Colombo, Kandy and Jaffna, the library is an institution. In addition to the usual resources, members have access to an online library with over 14,000 e-journals and over 119,000 e-books on various subjects.
Over the years the library has morphed into the ideal getaway for anyone. In a mood to read Then browse through the extensive, diverse selection of books on the shelves. In the mood for some company and good art Attend one of the many open mics, theatre nights, book readings and signings, storytelling sessions, panel discussions, and movie screenings. This is a space where thousands of people- both young and old-have met and forged connections and long-lasting friendships.

With the refurbishment, the British Council Colombo Library builds on this convening capacity. The young learner area will be bigger, with more space for stretching out with a good book or poring over a magazine. An instrumental area with a piano will serve some light entertainment. There will also be a coffee corner- after all, what pairs better with a book than a steaming hot mug of tea or coffee
On 3 June, its open day at the library- inclusive of a book club discussion, a story telling session and drama workshop for kids, art therapy for adults, monologues, acoustic performances, and even an open mic session. Drop by between 10 am and 8 pm on Sunday 3 June to catch the programme; and dont forget- it all happens here.

Police probing if anti-drug sentiments led to Councillor's killing
	
The police today said they were probing to establish whether test cricketer Dhananjaya de Silva's father Dehiwala-Mt. Lavinia Municipal Councillor Ranjan de Silvaskilling was linked to the Councillor's opposition to drug smuggling.
Ranjan de Silva was gunned down by three men armed with T-56 weapons outside his residence in Ratmalana on Thursday night.
A senior police officer investigating the incident today said that several police teams were conducting investigations into the shooting.
He said the Councillor was targeted by either drug smugglers or underworld gangsters as he was reported to have revealed the identity of drug smugglers and spoken against them.
The investigating officers said they believed they could be able to identify the shooters and the cause within a few days as a comprehensive investigation had been launched into the incident. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Real estate hotspots in Sri Lankas South-West quadrant
	
Much has been made in the media lately, about foreign direct investment in infrastructure in Sri Lanka, principally from China, and concerns about Sri Lanka becoming over reliant on such sources for its development. There has been less discussion as to how new infrastructure feeds into other sectors, such as commercial, hospitality and residential real estate, and the trickle down benefits to all, as wealth is distributed throughout the economy.
A number of recent road infrastructure projects, have been instrumental in making vast tracts of land in Sri Lankas south west quadrant more accessible. Reduced travel times from key entry points have opened previously redundant land to development possibilities, especially in the hospitality sector.
Once sustainable tourist numbers are established, commercial enterprises, including retail as well as food & beverage outlets, enter the market to service tourist requirements, and these are quickly followed by residential developments, in all price segments, as demand can be verified. This process is not limited to roads, as over time, other methods of moving people and goods become necessary, driving rail improvements and the development of regional airports to meet additional demand.
Perhaps the best known example of this effect in Sri Lanka is the 126 km, E01 Southern highway, opened in November 2011, between Colombo and Galle, extended to reach Matara in 2014 and now being pushed through to Hambantota. Other routes that are having positive outcomes for real estate include the 99 km Colombo to Kandy Expressway, being developed over two phases, and scheduled in time to be extended northwards to Jaffna and eastwards to Trincomalee. 29.2 km of the Colombo Outer Circular Highway (OCH), funded by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) opened in March 2014 between Kottawa and Kaduwela, being one of several planned phases to create an orbital belt around Colombo, linking highways and easing congestion.
Negombo is perhaps one of the clearest examples of the infrastructure effect, enjoying more overnight stays than any other beach destination in Sri Lanka - 90% of which from leisure travellers. The closest resort to this key entry point currently has an inventory of 1400 keys and is dominated by the Jetwing group with 6 facilities and 400 rooms. However, recent infrastructure improvements, including the Peliyagoda, Negombo, Puttlam Expressway extension has resulted in some 300 rooms being added, representing a growth of 17%, and a future supply of 800 rooms in the pipeline, an explosive 57% increase!
The coastal stretch from Bentota through Hikkaduwa to Balapitiya, close to the Southern Expressway and the mooted Southern Railway Line improvement scheme, is witnessing meteoric growth. International hotel operators from as far afield as Spain, India, Thailand and Japan are adding significant inventory, and local brand John Keells is adding 150 new keys by redeveloping the Bentota Beach Hotel. Other schemes that have leveraged reduced travel times include the government initiative, led by the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, Dedduwa Lake Resort, which plans to develop 1800 hectares of wetlands to the east of Bentota, into an integrated resort facility, utilizing existing waterways and enhanced connectivity.
Further south, the historic fort city of Galle was one of the first beneficiaries of improved infrastructure. The extension to Matara has opened up 64 km of coastline as far as Tangalle, for development. Previously, the scale and height of development was restricted to reflect the landscape and height of coconut palms, but now two 12 storey residential complexes by Fairway dominate the vista and further along the coast at Weligama the 14 storey, 198 suite Marriott Hotel & Spa certainly stands out. In the luxury hospitality sector, the 172 room Amari Galle is a notable new entrant and in the luxury residential space, Serenia Talpe, just along the coast, with 47 units, is scaled to blend with the beachscape environment, while Elysian, Mirissa, takes a different approach, with 5 towers, up to 14 storeys over podium level, set to tower over the neighboring area.
Municipal authorities are struggling to keep abreast of the scramble for development applications, but the Coastal Conservation Department has flexed its muscles, recently, bulldozing 21 allegedly illegal structures being used for hospitality, mainly food and beverage purposes, on Mirissa beach, following complaints from concerned persons.
Moving inland to Sri Lankas fabled hill country, the commercial centres of Kandy and Nuwara Eliya are yet to realise the full impact of the infrastructure bonanza, as modern standard road and rail connections are yet to reach these important tourist destinations and regional commercial centres. Land prices have, nevertheless, been rising steadily in expectation of a boom in development activity when connectivity improves. Today there is a lack of internationally recognized hoteliers in either location, but Hilton Group have recently signed up to operate a 150 room Hilton Kandy Resort and Double Tree by Hilton will operate a 96 key hotel in Nuwara Eliya. The residential sector is still finding its feet in Kandy although the 18 storey, 93 unit, Dynasty Kandy, catches the eye and in Nuwara Eliya, Span 20 Tower, by Span Engineering will offer 56 units

Twelve Sri Lankan migrant workers stranded as a result of a labour dispute in Somaliland, a self-declared state of Somalia, would return toSri Lanka shortly, the Foreign Affairs Ministry said.
The Ministry said the workers would be brought back safely in coordination with the Sri Lankan Embassy in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and with the assistance of the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
In a statement, the Ministry said Sri Lanka does not have diplomatic and consular presence in Somaliland.
Therefore, the Ministry and the Sri Lanka Embassy in Addis Ababa worked with the IOM Office in Hargeisa which interceded to negotiate with the employer concerned in Somaliland to resolve the labour dispute, to secure the release of the Sri Lankans, and facilitate their safe return, it said.
The Sri Lankan Government expressed its gratitude to the IOM for the role it played by providing assistance to the Government and people of Sri Lanka on this particular occasion as well as in the past in many similar situations.
The Foreign Affairs Ministry urged all Sri Lankans to be cautious in undertaking employment in high risk territories in which Sri Lanka does not have resident diplomatic and consular presence.

The ever expanding balloon  of plastic
	
I recently toured Cairo and was horrified to witness the mountains of plastic garbage stacked on all corners of the streets. In a city that receives less than 4mm of annual rainfall, there is hardly any chance for even biodegradable plastics to fragment. Soon Cairo will experience pyramids of plastic thanks to their recycling policies. 
In neurosurgery, when a tumour expands inside the skull or when there is bleeding into the brain, we tag that as a space occupying lesion/haematoma. As the skull has a compact arrangement if some intruder expands inside, the brain which usually occupies this territory is pushed aside. This ultimately results in death. 
Similarly I foresee danger in the heavy use of plastic and the ever expanding balloon of plastics.Unlike balloons, plastic containers do not burst and they tend to occupy space. Even if finely crushed the amazing nature of plastic does not allow compact forms. 
There are two types of plastic, thermoplastic and thermo-sets. Thermo plastics can be reheated and moulded into many shapes. These are ideal for recycling. Thermo-sets on the other hand can be heated only once. The only way to get rid of thermo-sets is to burn them. These are not suitable for recycling. Burning released toxic gases which are extremely hazardous. And also result in tiny fragments which pollute air and water without being wiped away . 
	Sri Lanka needs to rapidly impose laws on importing plastic
	
	
	Will the grounded plastic affect agriculture one day 
	
	
	Worldwide statistics show that only 30% of plastic waste is recycled
	
	
	Man created plastic and only man has the ability to halt plastic industry
	
Imagine a world filled with plastic dumps surrounding houses or even disrupting nice landscapes. Plastics that become a playground to pests and harvest infections. Plastic bottles gently strolling the roads in wind and rain, causing traffic jams. Mountains of polymer dumps which collapse and cause casualties. (We failed to identify, that the Meethotamulla garbage dumps do not undergo natural degradation because of plastics ; the true culprit). 
So you may wonder what to do with plastic The amazing substance which created unimaginable possibilities even in aviation industry is becoming a menace now. Worldwide statistic show that only 30% of plastic waste is recycled. The rest will lie out there in dumps for centuries to come. What about plastic energy There is some hope on using plastic as an energy source although data shows that the toxic waste and carbon monoxide generated is worse than a thermal power plant. 
Will the grounded plastic affect agriculture one day Will plastic dumps affect the marine biodiversity Man created plastic and only man has the ability to halt the plastic industry. As a country Sri Lanka needs to rapidly impose laws on importing plastic. Or else our country will be one of the leading plastic disposals in a few decades.

Thousands in Berlin for far-right demo and counter-protests
	
DPA, 27th MAY, 2018 - Several thousand demonstrators from across Germany gathered in the capital on Sunday to rally for freedom and democracy in an event organized by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, with anti-AfD protesters lining the route in central Berlin.
About 2,000 police provided strict security for the group and estimated the rough head count as the AfD demonstration made its way to the Brandenburg Gate.Attendees were expected to hear speeches by party leaders Joerg Meuthen and Alexander Gauland.
The party estimated that about 5,000 had turned out for their A Future for Germany event. Previously, they had said about 1,000 would attend.
Started as a Eurosceptic party, the AfD got a boost in 2015 after Chancellor Angela Merkel announced an open-door policy to refugees fleeing places like Syria and Afghanistan. The surge in foreigners stoked public concerns that helped the AfD enter the national parliament last year as the main opposition party. But the partys success has also prompted a pushback from various groups under the umbrella organization Stop the Hate.

Tobacco: Let us stop the carnage right now
	
Let us kill our customers can be the un-stated marketing objective of only one industry. It is not the arms industry, industries peddling lethal chemicals of many guises or unhealthy food for different manufactured needs. This industry manufactures, markets and profits from substance that kill over seven million of their customers every year and seriously harming and maiming others. Worldwide it caused over US$ 1.4 trillion in healthcare costs. Despite this, it is one of the most profitable industries in the world, with an income larger than the GDP of some countries, giving it ample resources to peddle influence, buy loyalty and keep profiting through killing. 
Manipulation of the unaware and the unmindful for corporate gains has become the norm even in the so-called liberal, democratic, rich and educated societies. There are many examples of such profiteering from products, services and even from the new-fangled norm  social media. Tobacco is different. It kills its customers. Its purveyors know it, understand it and accept it. Most of them do not use it. 
Tobacco is the most preventable cause of death in the world. One in two tobacco users will die because of a disease caused by tobacco. It can be through a heart disease, stroke, cancer or any one of the other numerous diseases caused by this product. This is well known. Thousands of studies attest to the devastating harm of tobacco on the human body. Many studies have proven the massive economic and social costs that occur as a result. Then, how can such a substance be sold legally Why do people keep using it 
It is a game, using 3 Ds. Deception, Doubt and Deceit. And Resources with a capital R.

"Do those earning a living from this industry realize what they earn to pay for spending on their children result in other children losing their fathers Do they realize that the objective of what they do in their jobs daily is to create demand and increase the use of a deadly product"
Deception A cigarette is made to be a tool of liberation, sophistication and individual choice for its users. How this is done so is well documented from the time when Edward Bernayce stated the Torches of Freedom campaign that shamelessly aimed to get women to smoke as an act of liberation. Fortunately, no longer can it be marked a rebel product, as smoking marketed to our grandfathers. If it was tried, it would be stretching things too far, so that even the most uninformed and the vacuous brains will register that a habit of our grandfather could not possibly be rebellious, or even fashionable after all this time. 
Do those earning a living from this industry realize what they earn to pay for spending on their children result in other children losing their fathers Do they realize that the objective of what they do in their jobs daily is to create demand and increase the use of a deadly product To snare children and make them smoke Perhaps they too are deceived just like the unfortunate users of this product. 
Doubt Doubt is a weapon of this industry. Academic papers, newspaper articles and even films record how they sow doubt about the scientific findings on the harms of tobacco. It has been well documented how scientists were hired to write scientific articles and appear in the media, casting doubt on the substantial body of research that show the true colours of this deadly substance. 
Deceit All around the world, this industry is not shy of using outright lies to make governments hesitate in implementing measures that protect their people from this industry and its products. The most familiar to us are smuggling is rampant following price increases of cigarettes, and smokers switch to other alternatives such as beedi when the price of cigarettes are increased, both which reduce government revenue. Nothing of this sort has happened in the past, despite the repeated squawking. There are many other such true sounding lies that are used. 

"The current laws and regulations on tobacco will control and reduce the misery but will not eliminate it. There is no scientific, social, moral or economic reason for allowing this to carry on. Governments are not meant to cover, quiver or salivate before unbridled corporate greed"
They also rob entire countries. In Sri Lanka, as in many Asian countries this industry is owned by trans-national corporations that take almost all of its profits away to their homes in the West. Even so, rational and technically sound taxation can reduce this drain of wealth from the poor to the rich world. However in Sri Lanka, such a safety net does not function. 
How does the profits of an industry increase almost ten-fold, just over 10 years, while the number of its products sold has decreased steadilyIs the tax that can be collected being gifted to the industry How can successive governments allow this industry to rip the country off by allowing the tax collected from this industry to erode in real-terms, costing the country billions of rupees every year Why are even the senior citizens taxed on their paltry interest income and even the poorest of the poor burdened by more and more taxes while the taxation of tobacco has not changed over 18 months Accident Design Neglect Incompetence Or something more putrid 
The current laws and regulations on tobacco will control and reduce the misery but will not eliminate it. There is no scientific, social, moral or economic reason for allowing this to carry on. Governments are not meant to cover, quiver or salivate before unbridled corporate greed. After all, governments and government institutions exist to protect people. People, whose money is sucked to maintain them. The time to stop allowing this intentional, targeted and heartless carnage that is going on is right now. If not, millions more would have died or will become incapacitated, families pushed into poverty and an untold numbers of children would have lost their fathers by the time World No Tobacco Day arrives again on 31st May next year. Guess who would be still laughing all the way to the bank
