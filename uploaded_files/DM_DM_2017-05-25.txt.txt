Arrest Muslim racists before arresting Gnanasara Thera
	
Sinhala Ravaya General Secretary Magalkande Sudaththa Thera said today stern action should be taken to arrest Muslim minsters who supported Muslim extremism before Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Gnanasara Thera was arrested.
Sudaththa Thera told a news conference that Muslim political factions were trying to label Gnanasara Thera as another Prabhakaran who was igniting racism and causing harm to the Muslim community.
According to them Gnanasara Thera is the worst criminal in the country and the one who is destroying the archaeological sites in the country, the one who has destroyed forest reservations and the one who bring drugs into the country, the Thera said.
He said Gnanasara Thera raised his voice against the destruction of the Sinhala Buddhist archaeological sites and the clearing of forest reserves in the country.
He has done nothing bad to the country, the Thera said.
Sudaththa Thera said several attempts had been made by several extremists groups to assassinate Gnanasara Thera and contracts had been offered to these groups.
Today, a warrant had been issued to arrest Gnanasara Thera. However, there is no one in charge of issuing the warrant. No police department had been informed to arrest him, the minister who is in charge of the police department or the Justice and Buddha Sasana Minister does not know about the arrest. Therefore, its reasonable to believe that there is an attempt to abduct Gnanasara Thera and assassinate him, Sudantta Thera said.
He said the BBS was not responsible for the attacks on Muslim religious centers and that there should be credible inquiries regarding these attacks.
We also condemn these attacks. Investigations should be made to arrest Muslims who attacked their mosques, he said.
The Thera said, Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran should be arrested first followed by Northern Provincial Councillor M.K. Sivajilingam.
He said Mr. Sivajilingam has allegedly said that even President Maithripala Sirisena could be arrested if he comes to Jaffna and make statements which ignite racism.
Then State Minister of Child Affairs, Vijayakala Maheswaran should be arrested. Later, Trade and Investment Minister Rishard Bathiudeen, National Unity Front Leader Azath Sally should also be arrested for issuing statements igniting racism, Gnanasara Thera could be the last one to be arrested, the Thera said. Now the Muslim extremists claim that they are having a problem of having archaeological sites in their living areas such as in Eastern Province. However, the Archaeological Department Director had been removed to ease their work, the Thera said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

CIA ex-chief cites signs
	

Former CIA Director John Brennan said on Tuesday that he does not know whether President Donald Trumps 2016 presidential campaign colluded with Russia but that he saw information and intelligence that was worthy of investigation. 
In addition, the countrys top intelligence official, Dan Coats, declined to say, as reported by the Washington Post, whether Trump had asked him to publicly deny that any evidence exists on collusion between his campaign and Moscow. 
The two men testified at separate congressional hearings amid a political storm in Washington over the fallout from Trumps firing on May 9 of FBI Director James Comey. Comeys dismissal came in the middle of an FBI probe into Russian meddling in the election and possible collusion with Trumps campaign, leading to accusations by Trump critics that the Republican president has sought to curtail the FBI inquiry, which could potentially amount to obstruction of justice. Brennan, testifying to the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, said it became clear last summer that Russia was trying to interfere in the presidential election, and that he warned the head of Russias FSB security service that such interference would hurt U.S. ties. 
It should be clear to everyone Russia brazenly interfered in our 2016 presidential election process and that they undertook these activities despite our strong protests and explicit warning that they do not do so, Brennan said. 
Republican Representative Trey Gowdy asked Brennan, Did you see evidence of collusion, coordination and conspiracy between Donald Trump and Russian state actors

Ehelepola Kumarihamy- a heroic figure
	
Womens Organisations in the country have not shown any interest in martyrs like Ehelepola Kumarihamy but have always drawn attention to the lives of women in foreign countries. Ehelepola Kumarihamy not only gave her life but those of her children and family to uphold her honour. She resisted the advances of a mighty king, which led to her drowning and the barbaric massacre of her children. 
Ehelepola Kumarihamy was considered the most beautiful woman in the Court of Kandy, surpassing Subamma, the mother of Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe. She was the sister of Maha Adikaram Keppetipola and wife of Disava Ehelepola. When Subamma arrived in the Kandyan Kingdom with the nine-year-old Kannaswamy, who became Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe, she was considered to be the most beautiful woman in Kandyan territory. This would have been the reason for Pilamatalawa fostering her and bringing up Kannaswamy, later to be elevated to the throne against the wishes of the Court. 
By placing Kannaswamy on the throne, he had other motives and thought young Kannaswamy, who was 18-years-old, could be used as a pawn in his hands. However he was beheaded on a flimsy suspicion. It is in this background that events took a turn in the Kandyan Court. 
Kandyan law at the time though considered by the British as barbaric , were really following the actions taken by the British soldiers during the rebellion that followed after 1815. 
As one would say, King Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe bent the law for his own ends against the advice of one of his confidantes in Court, Tennakoon Rajapakse Mudiyanselage Punchi Banda. He said the law did not permit children to be pounded. But Molligoda who had an axe to grind with Ehelepola, read out the order of the King. It is a known fact that the King by this time was a drunkard and whether he really understood Molligoda is questionable. 
It was said by British observers at the time that Ehelepola Kumarihamy only took the pounder in her hand and laid it on the mortar. She did this in order to avoid the shame that it was given by a Gahalaya  (low-caste man ). 
The man who advised the King, his confidante Punchi Banda, was banished from the inner city.
The Walauwa of Ehelapola Kumarihamy was the official residence within the inner city.

Irresistibly Italian: sixty years of the Fiat 500
	

DPA, 24th MAY, 2017- To children, it seems like a giant toy car; to senior citizens, its a reminder of their carefree youth. The Fiat 500 puts a smile on peoples faces wherever it goes. This cuddly classic was an instant hit 60 years ago, and has been an enduring and affordable classic ever since.
Unmistakably Italian, the Fiat 500 evokes sunny days in Mediterranean climes. The tiny classic from Turin stands for the good life, the dolce vita, and is the automotive equivalent of that other Italian icon, the Vespa motor scooter.
Enthusiasts like German owner Christian Besser do not regard the Fiat 500 solely as a lifestyle vehicle but as a marvel of economical engineering. After all, when the car first appeared in July 1957, the term lifestyle was unknown.

Lotus Tower -A controversy standing tall
	
The spiralling Lotus Tower is on its way to becoming South Asias tallest building, dominating the Colombo skyline. This 350 metre tall structure will serve as a transmission tower for several TV and FM broadcasting stations.
This towering structure which commenced its construction during the previous regime was quite an over-priced deal and halfway through, its construction was halted.
While the land it stands on belongs to the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), there are allegations that the Ministry of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure hasnt paid a cent for this transaction. In an attempt to shed light on this project and to uncover its current status, the Dailymirrorspoke to a few individuals of varied expertise

Do you think the Lotus Tower is the need of the hour now that it seems to be a waste of public funds
a) Yes
b) No
c) Don't know
online surveys






The construction
This Chinese EXIM bank-funded US $ 104.3 million project was commenced on January 20, 2012 and was expected to be completed within 912 days as per the initial plan, but by the said finishing date only the concrete structure was completed. Although its main function is that of a telecommunication tower, it will be designed to serve as a multi-functional building. Its three-storied tower base will house various shopping centres, food courts and possibly even a walk-through museum. The tower itself will house banquet halls and an observation deck on the eighth floor. The Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) estimates that its petals will be in place by August of this year. The TRC also has plans of building an interactive app to improve visitor experience in the tower. This app will enable users to, for instance, check the availability of seats for a movie and make immediate bookings or remotely reserve seats at a restaurant. According to the original plan the construction should have completed by 2014.
However, a recent media report indicated that it is expected to be completed by October this year.


The SLPA didnt receive a cent for the land
- Arjuna Ranatunga
In his comments to the Dailymirror, former Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said the constructions were going on and the project was done on land belonging to the SLPA. We never received a cent for it. Im still trying to get some money from the Telecommunications Ministry. I feel most of the decisions taken by the previous government were bad and we had to face many inconveniences because of that. Even the Htota Port could have been built at a lesser cost than what they have spent. They should have done a feasibility report and even projects such as the Port city could have been done in a proper way. Some of the contracts cannot be changed and we dont want to antagonize some of the countries. When a massive project comes in, governments from other countries get involved and we dont want to cause issues with them. They have started to build friendly ties with the new government and we want to strengthen these relationships.

We need to move into digital broadcasting
-Prof. Rohan Samarajiva
The also contacted telecommunications expert Professor Rohan Samarajiva to find out whether this costly tower will serve its purpose in this digital era. Prof. Samarajiva is also the founding Chair of LIRNEasia, an ICT policy and regulation think tank active across the Asia-Pacific region, The age of satellites was back in the 60s and 70s. Now we are in the age of smartphones. There are emerging trends in technology and we need to keep up with them. Satellites could be used for purposes such as remote sensing and GPS. This symbol of modernity was established after various other structures around the world. Although it was established as a solution for TV broadcasting tower many more additions will be done to it. Speaking in terms of broadcasting, we are using analogue broadcasting methods which are highly inefficient. This is mainly due to the interference in frequencies between towers. Once you get a conventional antenna, you need to adjust it to pair with the tower in either Depanama or Pannipitiya. Still you will not get a clear view of the channel you need to watch. This is old technology and we need to look at implementing digital broadcasting instead. If we auction the 700MHz band used for analogue broadcasting and instead use it for digital broadcasting it will be more convenient for the users and will generate more revenue as well. We also dont have people watching TV on big screens anymore. They watch TV on their smart devices. People are stuck in the thinking of the analogue age. On the other hand, Colombo is still not a very interesting city to tourists. There should be more restaurants and attractions to make it an interesting place to visit. The need of the hour is to move to digital broadcasting. There is a limited number of channels in advanced economies and they all use digital broadcasting. We are trying to find a solution through a method used back in the 60s. We could call in private broadcasters to buy frequencies and some frequencies will yield enormous benefits. Therefore we need to consider this option rather than investing on mega-scale projects such as this Lotus Tower. 
Now we are in the age of smartphones. There are emerging trends in technology and we need to keep up with them. Satellites could be used for purposes such as remote sensing and GPS


There was a problem with the technology
-Rosmand Senaratne
The Dailymirror also learned that Rosmand Senaratne, the former Chairman of Independent Television Network (ITN) was one of the key persons who had requested for a tower of this nature during the previous regime. Speaking to the Daily Mirror Mr. Senaratne said that there was a need transfer telecommunication signals to a central point. In order to receive signals we had to turn our antennae in all directions. But in developed countries they have a central point in which they house a tower to transmit signals to all television channels. Therefore we too had to implement such a system. Through this the viewers will be greatly benefitted. The cost factor of course is a different topic.
When asked as to why they wanted to go proceed with an analog system in the digital age, Mr. Senaratne said that there was a prevailing issue about which technology they would implement. The Germans had one plan, the Chinese had another and the Japanese had their own system.

The project is now under the purview of the President
-Harin Fernando
Minister of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure, Harin Fernando said the Lotus Tower Project was now under the purview of the President. The proposal was to establish a telecommunication tower, facilitating 50 TV channels and 35 FM radio stations. It will also house a shopping mall, restaurants and eventually develop into a tourist attraction. Since it was too costly, the construction was halted for a while but is now underway.

Muslims will be compelled to seek int'l community support: EPC Opposition Leader
	
If the incumbent government continued to overlook the racist acts perpetrated on the Muslim community, it would lead to a situation to lodge the complaint with the international community, EPC Leader of the Opposition M.S Uthumalebbe said.
Hence, the government and the defence sector should take action to contain the racist acts inflicted upon the Muslim community, he said.
The EPC Leader of the Opposition made the above comments after presenting an emergency Bill on Tuesday to institute legal action on those who perpetrated racist acts on the Muslim community in various places across the country when the House met presided over by Chairman Chandradasa Galappaththi.
Muslims in Sri Lanka voted for a change of regime since the previous government did not take any action on the attacks inflicted upon the Muslim community and their places of worship. Sadly, even in the regime of good governance racist acts on Muslims were increasing at an alarming level. That had led to a situation for the Muslims to live in constant fear. Many business establishments owned by the Muslims and their places of worship were attacked during last month. Moreover, incidents of grabbing the ancestral lands owned by Muslims living in border villages continued unabated, the EPC Opposition Leader said.
He said that the EPC should appeal to the President and the Prime Minister to take legal action against the racist groups indulged in these unlawful acts and to bring the situation under control.
"Ampara is the only district where Muslims are in the majority. Lands in Ampara are not issued based on the ratio of the population. I have requested the District Secretary of Ampara to distribute lands based on the ratio of the population," he said. (Riyaz Adam)

Pace of reforms have slowed considerably: EU
	
The European Union (EU) noted that the pace of reforms in Sri Lanka had slowed significantly with straightforward deliverables such as the operationalisation of the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) yet to materialise.
Ambassador of the EU to Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Tung-La Margue said that more needed to be done quickly to hasten reconciliation efforts.
He expressed these views when he met National Integration and Reconciliation State Minister A.H.M. Fowzie at his ministry last week.
Issuing a statement, the EU delegation yesterday said Ambassador Margue and Minister Fowzie had discussed the Government's priorities with regards to reconciliation as well as the EU's wide-ranging support to the Government's reforms.
During the discussion on resettlement, Minister Fowzie had noted the progress in land returns and underscored the complex realities of resettlement and land restitution in the former conflict zones.
Minister Fowzie had assured greater cooperation between his ministry and the EU and expressed the country's appreciation to it for funding already pledged towards strengthening the reconciliation process in Sri Lanka.
The EU is providing EUR 12 million to strengthen the reconciliation process by seeking institutional consensus across various government entities and civil society, in addition to contributing to strengthening the linkages between the government and the people at the grass-roots.
The programme will also facilitate initiatives that link reconciliation and non-recurrence by addressing language barriers and psycho-social needs as well as using arts and culture to break down barriers between communities.
The statement said the EU will provide a further EUR 8.1 million to support long-term peace-building efforts.

Restoring lost  pride the Veheragoda MeEgaHawela Temple
	
In the Badulla district lies a small hamlet called Veheragoda, which King Dutugemunu was said to have passed on his way to Anuradhapura to fight King Elara. The villagers believe that there were temples here in ancient times. Although there are no material remains left, this story has been passed down from generation to generation. 
One of the villagers, Nalin Premachandra RSP who had once been an army officer attached to the first Medical Corps., decided to restore this lost pride to his hometown. Accordingly he embarked on an ambitious move to raise the village temple to a historical place of worship. We have had a proud history but we dont have anything left to prove it. Therefore my objective is to see that we have a temple which could go down in history some day. If I achieve this goal, my village will regain its lost pride, Premachandra said, explaining his lone effort to develop the village temple. Determination seemed to be one of his personality traits as he related how he saved the lives of 58 injured army personnel during a bloody battle against the LTTE in Kilinochchi, during his days in the army.
The livelihood of almost everyone in this village is agriculture and they cant afford to assist the temple financially as they dont earn much
Premachandra raised funds to construct the chaithya of Veheragoda Megawela Temple all by himself. I got ticket books printed myself and went to seek financial help from donors. I even went around in buses to get help from the public, Premachandra said. He had managed to raise around Rs.1 million for the project. 
The Chaithya is built on a strong foundation which reaches 11 feet into the ground. The most attractive parts of it are the parapet walls with elephant carvings. When one looks at it from outside one can feel as if the chaithya is surrounded by a herd of elephants. 
According to the Chief Incumbent of the temple,Ven. Pussallakande Senananda Thera, this temple was constructed in the year 2000. The temple comprises of a Dharma Shalawa and the Viharageya. However, these need repairs now and we need funds, he said.
According to the Ven. thera villagers alone cannot afford to provide financial assistance. The livelihood of almost everyone in this village is agriculture and they cant afford to assist the temple financially as they dont earn much, the Thera said.

Why aren't disabled soldiers entitled to a pension: War heroes
	
If the Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka is entitled to a lifetime pension and other benefits then why are soldiers disabled in the line of duty not entitled to such benefits, the National Movement for the Protection of War Heroes asked.
The disabled soldiers staged a protest opposite the presidential secretariat to urge the government to pay them a pension and said they had been neglected despite the sacrifices they made to safeguard Sri Lanka's sovereignty and integrity during a three-decade armed conflict.
Convener Nishantha Pradeep Kumara said the war was won at a huge cost with some 27,000 soldiers dead, 2,000 gone missing and may more injured. Victory was gained not by Mr. Fonseka alone but by way of a collective effort.
He said the government was duty-bound to ensure a better live for for disabled war heroes.(Thilanka Kanakarathna)
