An unstable Maldives will lead to an unstable Indian Ocean President Yameen has to go - Nasheed
	
Former President of Maldives, currently in exile and stationed in Colombo, Mohamed Nasheed in a candid interview with the Daily mirror insisted that the current President must step down in order to resolve the ongoing political turmoil the country is engulfed in. 

On the night of my exile Sri Lankan Ministers were in Male 
	I have the ground support ofmy people
	China seems to support autocratic Governments

QPresident Nasheed, to start off with, in December 2011 there was a political crisis in which the former Chief Justice was arrested under your leadership. How do you see todays crisis in the light of the then turmoil 
Thank you very much. In 2011, it wasnt the former Chief Justice. In 2010 we came up with the new Judiciary. In 2008 we established a new Constitution which called for the establishment of the three branches of the Government: The Judiciary, the Legislature and the Executive. But unfortunately we were only able to set up the Supreme Court and the High Court. The Lower Courts were transferred en masse from the previous judiciary. So at that time there were differences regarding a Judge in the Criminal Court who was then removed from office by the Judicial Services Commission, but he continued to come to office, but there was some difficulty there. But what is happening now is President Yameen has arrested the Chief Justice, another Supreme Court justice and the Judicial administrator. And President Yameen has also imposed emergency rule, curtailed a number of rights in the Constitution and he has effectively overrun the state and imposed marshal law. He has also arrested former President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who is his own brother, and he has also arrested his own nephew. He has also arrested the husband of his niece. This is apart from the other political leaders and the members of his own party he has arrested. So he has not only purged his own party, he has gone ahead and arrested members of his family, imposed emergency rule and has arrested a number of Judges, including the Chief Justice. He has also intimidated a Private Media Channel and forced its closure. 
QPresident Nasheed, I need to take you back to what led to this current turmoil. According to you what was the catalyst which escalated to what we are seeing today. 
The elections in 2013 itself were questionable. But we relented and President Yameen was sworn in. He was sworn in an alliance, which included the Jumhuri Party- led by the Hon. Cassim- and also the religious party Adalath. These parties came together. But as soon as President Yameen took over power he marginalised Hon, Cassim, the Adalath Party and President Gayoom. All of them left President Yameen. 
Whilst that was happening he started purging his own party. He first arrested his own Defence Minister and framed him. Then he went on to arrest me and every single other opposition leader. That created a necessity for the Opposition to come together. So when we came together and the injustices were observed by the International Community, especially the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the ICJ, and much of the legal fraternity in the world, including NGOs from Sri Lanka including the Government of Sri Lanka, said that the charges were politically motivated and the trials along with the sentences were also wrong. They were asked to reverse the sentences, but President Yameen refused. Finally the Supreme Court hearing the views of all these quarters decided to reverse the sentences. 

During the past 4 years we have had 23 unresolved murders. They havent been unresolved. The Deep State identified their foes, who are free thinkers, ordinary bloggers and mainly young people
QPresident Nasheed, you take us back to two pertinent points. One is that you listed down these various international organisations. But there is a notion that locally, you dont have the support you claim to have and that you have been puffed up by the International Community instead. How do you respond to this Do you actually have on the ground support 
We started a political party whilst I was in exile. This was around 2005-2006. We were able to galvanise our people into political activism and we won the elections in 2008. When we came to 2013 we were voted in as the single biggest political party with 47% of the votes. After that, very recently, in fact a few months back, we had our local council elections which we won handsomely. It was a landslide victory for us. I think its very obvious where the support lies. So it is a little confusing why anyone would want to read election results otherwise and try to come to an analysis or understanding that we dont have the support in Maldives. There is brute force. We are suppressed and we are unable to show our strength at home. 
QTo take you back, you were charged and convicted with offences related to terrorism. You were released from prison for medication and now you are in exile. Can you recall the circumstances which led to this 
Well, the Government of Sri Lanka for instance, after my arrest, together with a number of other governments robustly engaged with the Maldivian Government. Especially, given the fact that the International Legal bodies ruled that my arrest was politically motivated, many people felt that they had a moral obligation to intervene. So those interventions led to the decision by President Yameen to release me for medication. But it was very obvious when he let me out that there was a clear understanding in the Government that I was going to be in exile. 
QHow did that happen 
Well on that night your ministers were in Male. 
QWho were they 
Your Foreign Minister and Your Finance Minister 
QOne question that crops up in our minds is whether this experiment of democracy has failed in the Maldives 
Democracy is a process and the people of Sri Lanka will very well understand that. This country (Sri Lanka) has far greater capacity in democratic institutions than we do. But we are in our infancy. And we are getting more and more confident in the democratic process each day. 
For example the MDP is only 12 years old unlike your political parties. So this is going to take time. We havent succeeded as much as we would have liked to. But I woudnt term it as a failure. The democratic gains we have had post 2008 have not slipped to say 1970s standards. So yes we are improving. 
QPresident Nasheed this question is about the international community. You have called for India to act as liberators and on the other side you have China and this power struggle between these two powers. Where do you fit in How do you see this play out 
We are in the Indian Ocean. We are ocean people. We need both safety and security for our countries and the Indian Ocean as well. It is very clear that to achieve this it is fundamental that we have democratic governance. Dictatorship and autocracy hollow out the State. It leads you into bad projects. It leads you into debt traps. It opens you up to land grabs by other Governments. 
QHow uncomfortable are you in joining forces with President Maumoon Gayoom, whom you fought against and who is the half brother of the current President 
During the past15 to 20 years we have learned a lot. The Maldives have had so many experiences. These are experiences that other countries took 50 years to have. And I think all of us have a combining interest including President Gayoom. Our combining interest is democracy. We want to have a free and fair election. 
QBut isnt it ironic that President Gayoom is now on the side of holding a free and fair election, when he was accused by you of being a despot or a dictator 
Yes President Gayoom ruled with a single party and at that time we had a constitution which didnt allow for multi party politics. I would credit President Gayoom for facilitating multi party politics in the Maldives. The reformed road map by President Gayoom finally bought us toward free and fair elections and multi party politics. Now I would like to look towards the future. 
Yes we have to gain experience from the past, but we must work for generations to come and not for what was in the past. So I think we must work in unity having understood the commonalities between us and see that we have free and fair elections. 
QPresident Nasheed, the role of China in the current crisis has come into question. I dont know if you are able to say this in public or if you agree with me, but China has at least on the face of it sided with President Yameen. What importance does Chinas role play in all of this 
I am very candid in my views. China seems to support autocratic Governments and China has a number of projects in the Maldives. Once dictatorship is established and strengthened they start getting projects without a proper tendering process, without transparency and without democratic oversight. So these projects very often become vanity projects. You have roads leading to nowhere, you have harbours and airports that cant be used. All you are left with is a huge debt. Even now over 70% of our foreign debts is owed to a single country- China. And these are commercial loans, they either come from supplier credit or Exim Bank. So there are commercial interest rates and they are mostly infrastructure projects. You cant turn them around enough to be able to service the debt and you end up in a debt trap. Once you are in it, they leverage- the debt is used as a disciplining regime. Of course I understand that there is this difficulty, but we want to see direct foreign investment by the Chinese. We arent against that. We are a centre right party and we want a market economy to function. But we have to have a proper tendering process, democratic oversight and transparency. The absence of those contracts creates drivers for land grab. 
QDo you think that as a former President and someone who has been in control of a State in the Indian Ocean, that Sri Lanka has also fallen or is falling into this trap you described 
Well I must focus on The Maldives.
QWith regard to The Maldives, from here on wards, how do you see the current crisis really unfolding 
President Yameen has to go. He has to step down. And we must install an interim arrangement that would lead us to a Unity Government and thereafter an inclusive and free and fair election at the end of the year. 
QDo you think the atmosphere is conducive for it The latest reports suggest that President Yameen isnt relenting and the Supreme Court has overturned its previous decision, which led to the current crisis, and the Police and the Military have sided with him. 
Well a very small element of the Police and the Military are siding with him. The vast majority of The Maldives Military and Police arent with the President. Of course, we dont want to encourage mutiny, but we do want to see solutions and results. We will be talking to everyone to see that President Yameen steps down. I hope that the International Community would be more robust in its actions and asks President Yameen to step down. 
The President must now step down. And if he wants to contest a free and fair election in 2018, in my view, he must be in a position to contest. This cant happen if Yameen remains as President. We must have an interim arrangement. 

China seems to support autocratic Governments and China has a number of projects in the Maldives. Once dictatorship is established and strengthened they start getting projects without a proper tendering process, without transparency and without democratic oversight
QFrom the time you assumed power in 1998, we have seen internal power struggles. You accused your Deputy President of instigating the coup against you. President Yameen is experiencing the same situation and his Vice President and Defence Minister are out.
Our political system is very feudal in its outlook. This is because we are very new to democracy. It is very feudal. What we are trying to do is to overcome that. One fundamental nature of feudal politics is taking revenge. We want to break that. In fact we did. When we took over power we did not arrest President Gayoom. We wanted to break our historical and very feudal circle of arresting and targeting previous leaders. There is a pattern of this in other South Asian countries as well. But you know in Maldives it has been a bit more spectacular. But we are trying to overcome that. 
QYou have spoken about an Islamist threat and spoken of a strand of fundamentalist Islamism inherent within President Yameens Government. How do you see this and what are your reasons for such conclusions 
You see, for the past few years a very narrow version of Islam has been propagated in the Maldives. This has created a breeding ground for Jihadist movements and recruiting networks. We are now left with a very unfortunate situation where we have 300- 400 Maldivians fighting with ISIS ( Islamic State) in Syria and Iraq. That doesnt happen without a very strong network at home. The Islamists have embedded themselves in sections of the Military, Police, Immigration, Customs, and also in Education. So they are running a state within the state in the Maldives. 
QIs this happening with State sanction 
Well there is a very grey relationship that exists between the State and the Islamist Deep State. The Deep State has an understanding that they will maintain President Yameen in power. Now you earlier said that President Yameen has the support of the Military and the Police. No. He has the support of this Deep State. He has the support of the State within the State. 
During the past 4 years we have had 23 unresolved murders. They havent been unresolved. The Deep State identified their foes, who are free thinkers, ordinary bloggers and mainly young people. They ( the Deep State) identified their foes, they judged them, sentenced them and then they executed them. They were beheadings. 
This is very very worrying. We have two main issues. One is land grab, the other is the state within the State. If we do not have free and fair elections by the end of this year it would leave room for these two issues to infest to such an extent that we will not be able to pull it back. I think this is very worrying for the Indian ocean. An unstable Maldives will lead to an unstable Indian Ocean. 
QBut isnt this just fear mongering to garner support from your neighbours for your political ambitions 
There are academic papers and books written on this issue. We can hide you know and we can conceal the truth. But it will come and hit you. And when it does, it will hurt. When it spirals down to chaos it would become very difficult. As a Sri Lankan Journalist and I suppose the Sri Lankan people will understand this. This is not fear mongering. Intelligence departments, analysts, think tanks, journalists, diplomats and writers are very aware of this. 
QIf you do take over, how do you propose to quell this threat 
There is no magic to it. It will take time, but there is no magic to it. 
QAre you confident of victory in the event of an election 
Yes I am very confident. We will win, hands down. 
QHave you spoken to President Yameen during this period Has there been any conversation going on between you 
No there hasnt. He became a very different person once he took over. He left the fort of decency. And so there has been no conversation.

As a US citizen, I can't accept PMs post: Gota
	
Former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who returned yesterday to Sri Lanka from the US, said he could not accept the Prime Ministerial portfolio because he was an American citizen.
He said this when asked by the journalists at the Airport whether he would accept the Post of Prime Minister if it was offered by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).
I can't. I am an American citizen. So I cannot accept that portfolio. Besides, who wants to become a Prime Minister in a scenario such as what exists today, he said and added that he had still not decided to enter politics.
Commenting on the results of local government elections, he said everyone has come to realize former president Mahinda Rajapaksas value.
He made a great contribution to the country. Some people were misled about his achievements. After three years, they have realised that they have been misled. Therefore, people have shown that they need a Mahinda Rajapaksa administration, the former defence secretary said.
When asked about any of former presidents political decisions, the former defence secretary said it was up to the former president.
Meanwhile, he rejected the allegations levelled against him on the Avant Garde issue by the Presidential Commission.
There is nothing new about these allegations. The Commission does not even know what Avant Garde is, Mr. Rajapaksa said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Australia to deport LTTE suspect
	
A Sri Lankan asylum seeker, who is an LTTEsuspect,has been ordered for deportation next week, despite the UN requesting Australia not to move him while it investigates whether he will be tortured if he is returned, the Guardian reported on Monday.
It said the deportation order issued for asylum seeker Shantaruban by the Australian Border Force says he will be deported on February22.
He will not be permitted any visitors at the airport when he is removed and he will be escorted on his flight to Colombo. He has refused to sign the order.
In October last year the UN committee against torture issued an interim measure request, formally asking that Australia refrain from returning [Shantaruban] to Sri Lanka while his complaint is under consideration.
Shantaruban has arrived in Australia by boat in 2012. Having been released to live in the community, he was redetained in 2015 and has remained in immigration detention since.
He fled Sri Lanka fearing repercussions from government security forces for his involvement with the LTTE.
According to the brief before the UN committee, Shantaruban was an active and senior member of the LTTE in particular working as a boat-builder for its naval wing, the Sea Tigers.
The UN and other governments and human rights groups have consistently raised serious concerns over the return of Tamil asylum seekers to Sri Lanka, particularly those with known links to the LTTE.
There have been widespread reports of the mistreatment and torture of prisoners by Sri Lankan security forces, including the systematic use of rape, the Guardian reported.
The Sri Lankan government has consistently denied mistreatment is occurring.
Shantarubans claim for protection turns on his association with the LTTE, which has not been considered by Australian authorities.
Several letters attached to Shantarubans submission  including from refugees granted protection in Australia and Sri Lankan members of parliament  declare that he was a senior member of the LTTE.
But Shantaruban was initially reluctant to reveal his connection to the Tigers when he arrived in Australia seeking asylum because he feared he would face deportation or punishment.
Other former members of the LTTE have declared their association and have had their claims to persecution recognised by the Australian government.

Central Bank bombing survivor describes near-death experience
	
On Thursday, February 1, 1996, I walked towards my workplace in the Bank of Ceylon Headquarters building with total depression. Yes, it was happening everywhere but this time it had happened to us! The most destructive bomb in Sri Lanka hit us the previous day.
Just before noon on January 31, we heard gunshots. Naturally, we dashed to the windows. I saw people frantically running towards Galle Face. Not understanding, we looked towards the Central Bank and saw this old lorry going back and forth, ramming the gates of the Central Bank and back, over and over again. Since then I have never been able to look at a lorry without apprehension. When the bomb blew, black thick smoke spread into the Bank of Ceylon building through shattered glass and ripped venetian blinds. Repeated fire drills came to mind and we ran for the smoke lobby and then down the stairs. I had escaped with a piece of glass in my foot!
People were praying and climbing down, some 30 floors. Everyone made it to their allotted places on the lawn, but from there we had to work our way home. There was absolute chaos all over Fort. Down the stairs hobbled injured people, some carrying others, the chairman and the peon, and all of us united in fear. The last straw was when word came that another bomb may explode, but thankfully this did not happen.
The mayhem and havoc on Thursday was a pathetic sight. People in the Central Bank and Ceylinco did not have to report for work to those buildings. But to my horror I saw vehicles piled up like accordions on the road. A shaky small steel ladder poised from the top floor of Ceylinco to the next below. This had been the means of escape for some. The steel stair escape had been smouldering hot and the stairway on fire. Blood stains along the staircase in our bank building, the stench still in my nostrils. Bank employees with stitches and eyes in bandages were back at their desks. The hub of the lorry was found on the top most floor of the Bank of Ceylon and that is how as Kipling said we summoned up vestiges of courage and stooped and built them up 

Can we ever forget or live down that day All communities were affected. The bomb echoed from Fort to Ratmalana. It was the most violent and widespread we ever experienced.
Up to the Bank of Ceylon floors we could hear people trapped in the Central Bank, screaming! Did they die there Slowly... with no hope Did the President, PM, politicians of that time do nothing What of our engineers, doctors, construction workers Why were they not alerted to do something without ignoring the situation Anywhere else in the world, rescue missions would be ongoing 24/7. As of now, I did not hear of any rescue operations. Only huge loaders, tractors, shoveling bodies, rubble and where were they dumped
The exterior and interior of the bank building was damaged to a semicircle around the circumference on every floor. It took years to get back to normal.
I wonder if we ever will get back to normal after such harrowing experiences. It is now 21 years since this horrendous event -- and what was achieved

Changing the jockey is pointless: JO
	
Commenting on a move to replace Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe with Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, the joint opposition (JO) said today there was no point in changing the jockey without changing the direction the horse is moving.
The countrys horse is the government and the jockey is the Prime Minister. They should both be changed. The old horse is limping. Without changing the horse and the jockey, we cant revive the country, MP Bandula Gunawardena told a news briefing.
He said the only option available to solve the political instability in the country was to go for an election.
If the government is unwilling to do that right away, we can wait till its mandate expires. We have waited for three years and waiting for another 500 days is not an issue. Even the Supreme Court has given a clear ruling that the presidential election should be held on time. We need a new President, a Prime Minister and a brand new Government, the MP said.
He went on to say that the Government cannot resolve the issues that confront it without a proper peoples mandate. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

While claiming that Parliament should be dissolved immediately, Democratic Left Front (DLF) Leader and MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara said yesterday they were ready to discuss with other political parties to gain two-third majority to do so.
He told a news conference that a caretaker government should be formed after dissolving Parliament and added that it should take steps to hold a general election.
There should be a two-third majority to dissolve parliament. We are ready to join with other political parties specially anti-UNP forces despite any political differences to get their support. A caretaker government should be appointed, which should announce a general election. We will suggest Chamal Rajapaksa as the leader of the caretaker government, he said.
He said this government could not be removed legally from office but it had no mandate to remain in power any more.
Mr. Nanayakkara said a huge turmoil had emerged after the Local Government election results and added that even the World Bank and the IMF would ask the government to withdraw.
When asked whether they would join the SLFP, he said both the SLFP and they had been forced to do so and added that the SLFP MPs in the government should sit in the Opposition now.
They should come to the Opposition now. It means not to the Joint Opposition. People have rejected the national government with the UNP. People have rejected the UNPs policy, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Former Chairman of the Carlton Sports Network (CSN) Rohan Welivita had been summoned to the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) this morning to record a statement.
Speaking to Daily Mirror Mr. Welivita said the FCID had recorded a statement from him for three hours into an incident of selling a CSN property to a state bank.
He said the FCID was probing the incident that CSN had committed a crime by selling the property in violation of a Court order.
However he said CSN had sold the property with the necessary permission of the Court to settle a sum of Rupees 78 million loan which had obtained through a state bank.
After the CSN license was canceled without any valid reason, it was unable to settle the liabilities it had, he said.
Mr. Welivita said that he was summoned soon after the Governments defeat in the Local Government Election.
This could be an act of revenge, he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

A cooked provisions supplier to a central province council had lost his contract when he entered the local polls fray as an opposition candidate.

The food supplier had been informed of the termination of his contract soon after he filed his nomination to contest on the ticket of a budding political party.
The food supply contract was later awarded to a former chairman of a local body in the area, they say. Not to be outdone, the candidate had used the contract issue as a plank for his propaganda to win a sympathy vote.

## Title: Maha Shivarathri  The best day for Hindus to make  spiritual progress
## Section: News Features

Maha Shivarathri  The best day for Hindus to make  spiritual progress
	
As explained by Indian Hindu astrologists Maha Shivarathri is a purely religious ceremony of day time fast and vigil throughout the night. The rituals for the festival are observed by Hindus the world over with the aim of washing away all sins and to pave the way for eternal bliss. This spiritual bliss is experienced through basic religious practices of Ahinsa (non injury), Satya (truthfulness), Brahmacharya (Celibacy), Daya (Compassion), Karuna (forgiveness) and Anissa (absence of jealousy). 
Maha Shivarathri offers a solemn occasion to worship Lord Shiva on the longest night in the year. 
Maha Shivarathri is celebrated on the fourteenth night of Phalguna (February) according to the Hindu calendar which is the longest night in the year. 
Maha Shivarathri is a solemn occasion to worship Lord Shiva who is regarded as the Ocean of love, Ocean of knowledge, Ocean of mercy, Ocean of peace and Ocean of happiness. 
God Shiva is formless (Arupa). However, out of compassion for devotees he appears in the form of luminous light arising out of Shiva Lingam. He takes the form in this way for the sake of devotees who otherwise would be left in perpetual darkness. 

The origin of Shiva Rathri is explained in Purana legends. In the war between Suras and Asuras (demons or titans) Gods were likely to get defeated at one stage
Object of veneration 
Lingam has become the object of veneration of Hindus. Lingam worship signifies that Lord Shiva is prevalent in Shiva temples from ancient times. It is believed that Lord Shiva is in Shiva temples wearing a leopard skin and is in meditation and contemplation. 
Trident, the three pointed spear is his weapon. Udakkiya or Udukku, the drum which is small in the middle, is his musical instrument. His vehicle is an ox. 
The triad of Gods 
God Shiva is also known as God Iswara and is one of the Triad of gods. Brahma created the world. God Vishnu, who is mild, is kind and gentle and protects virtuous people and builds the world which has been created by Brahma. During God Sivas period, which is known as Iswara Vinsatiya, unrighteous and unlawful people are punished, just as righteous people are protected by God Shiva.
Great God in Hinduism 
In Hinduism he is the great God. It is said that out of his three wives, Uma or Umangana is the most beautiful and is a Goddess. Goddess Parwathie has excelled in dancing and music. His third wife Ganga is only a sign or a gesture. The stream of water flowing from god Shivas matted hair is believed to be his third wife, Goddess Ganga. They believe that Ganga purifies the whole of India. God of wisdom, Ganesh, and God of war, Skanda Kumara or Karthikeya are God Shivas sons. 
The origin of Shiva Rathri 
The origin of Shiva Rathri is explained in Purana legends. In the war between Suras (gods) and Asuras (demons or titans) Gods were likely to get defeated at one stage. So gods got round their survivor, God Vishnu and begged him to find a way to defeat the Asuras who were unrighteous and unlawful. While he was contemplating on a plan to defeat Asuras God Siva got an idea. He felt that if they could find Amurtaya, the medicine of immortality, ambrosia, the Asuras could be defeated because in that case Gods could remain immortal. Ambrosia or Nectar, the medicine of immortality of gods was deposited in the bed of the Milk Sea. 
Auspiciousness
A hunter who had killed many birds was being chased by a lion in the forest. In order to escape from the lion he had climbed a Vilva (Beli) tree. After sunset too he remained on the tree. To keep himself awake, without falling down from the tree, he went on plucking leaves of the tree and dropping them. This kept him awake the whole night. 
Vilva or Beli leaves fell on the Siva Lingam which was at the foot of the tree. This had pleased Lord Shiva and he had saved the hunter despite his sins of killing birds. Later, the people started worshipping Shiva lingam. 
Waking up early 
To mark the Sivarathri Festival devotees wake up early, take a ritual bath and after wearing fresh clothes visit the nearest Shiva Temple for Abhishekam or anointing the Shiva Lingam with milk, honey, ghee, sugar and water. In the temple priests perform pujas every three hours accompanied by the sound of temple bells. Devotees spend the night singing hymns and chanting Mantras, repeating the words Om Nama Sivaya. Flowers and leaves are used when performing pujas. The leaves of the Vilva tree are used because it is believed that the meritorious effect of the leaves of the Vilva tree is more. Usually puja ceremonies are conducted four times (Quarterly) during the night. 
The first quarter or Muthalaam Samaam commences at 8.00 P.M. Lotus flowers are given preference for the poojas performed during the first quarter. For this session hundred and eight water Kumbams are used. 
At 10.30 P.M. the second quarterly ritual commences. This puja is performed with forty nine Kumbams. In the second quarter puja Thulasi leaves are given preference. The most important part of the Sivarathri ceremony is performed during the third quarter commencing at mid night. This is called Linootpava Puja. It is believed that Lord Shiva, although formless, reveals himself in the form of a glowing light before devotees. This is an exalted, holy and a rare occurrence from the point of devotees. It is the climax of the ceremony where five priests participate with five Kumbams. The fourth quarter ceremony called Naankaam Saamam is the last and the auspicious part which commences at 3.00 am and comes to an end at dawn.
Apart from all night pujas devotees attend prayer sessions or bajans in the morning and evening at home or in parks and at river banks, situated near the temples. Devotees recite Sanskrit verses day and night. Some devotees keep awake the whole night. They offer coconuts, Vilva leaves, fruits and prepared food to Lord Shiva and his devine consort, Parvathie Devi. 
Cycle of death and rebirth
For the liberation from the cycle of death and rebirth and from pain or suffering Gautama Buddha enunciated the Four Noble Truths (Chathutarya Satya) and showed the way to liberation by following the exalted the Eight-fold Path ( Arya Asthangika Marga) which leads to attaining of Nibbana (Enlightenment). 
Hindu way of liberation 
The Hindu way of liberation is almost similar to that of Buddhism. Hindus believe that the layman could achieve Moksha or liberation through self realization and spiritual development. They attempt to achieve this target through fasting and prayers and believe that such practices have a tremendous influence over the mind and body. 
It is believed that a man who indulges himself in holy thoughts could achieve moksha and Maha Sivarathri is the best opportunity for the layman to engage in prayers and fasting and seek devine favours and achieve the state of Moksha through meditation.

Never shied away from taking responsibility in UN system: SL
	
Sri Lanka has never shied away from taking its fair share of responsibility in the UN system, which has helped Sri Lanka build an image as a moderate and progressive partner, able to bridge differences and build consensus, Sri Lanka's Ambassador to the UN Ravinatha Aryasinha said.
He made these observations when he addressed representatives of the diplomatic community, UN and other international organizations at a ceremony held to celebrate Sri Lanka's 70th Anniversary of Independence at the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) on February 6.
Ambassador Aryasinha also said Sri Lanka continues to give leadership on a wide range of issues such as disarmament, migration, human rights, health, intellectual property, science and technology and international trade policy in Geneva.
Sri Lanka's Permanent Representative to the World Trade Organization Ambassador R.D.S. Kumararatne, Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Mrs. Samantha Jayasuriya and Mission staff were associated with the Ambassador at the event.
The centre piece of the Geneva celebrations was an exhibition titled 'Facets of Sri Lanka', conceptualized and organized by the Sri Lanka Permanent Mission in Geneva, in collaboration with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).
Ambassador Aryasinha said 'Facets of Sri Lanka' was an opportunity to salute the work done by all the previous Ambassadors and staff who served in the Mission in Geneva, Sri Lankans in the International Civil Service and other Missions in Geneva, colleagues from diplomatic Missions, the UNOG, UN agencies, WTO and other international organizations, who over the years, have supported Sri Lanka, and contributed to Sri Lankas standing in Geneva.

NFF says replacing PM not the solution
	
While claiming that there is a move by the government to hand over the Prime Minister post to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, the National Freedom Front (NFF) asserted that a change of personnel was not what was needed.
Addressing a news briefing, NFF Media Spokesperson Mohammed Muzammil said the people appear to be disgusted with the government and added there should be a change of government.
It is crystal clear that people are disappointed with the way this government has been ruling the country. Therefore they cast their vote in favour of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) which has as its leader former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Muzammil said.
The citizens of the country have rejected both the President and the Prime Minister as witnessed during Local Government election held last Saturday (10). This government no longer has a mandate to run the country," he said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Officials accuse ex-president, judges of wanting to overthrow govt
	

HINDUSTAN TIMES, 12th FEBRUARY, 2018-Two arrested Supreme Court justices and a former president had been plotting to overthrow the government of the Maldives, officials in the Indian Ocean nation said, announcing they had found more than $200,000 in suspicious money in searches since a state of emergency was declared last week in the high-end tourist haven.
Lawyers and opposition leaders quickly rejected the accusations, saying President Yameen Abdul Gayoom was using the state of emergency to weaken his political opponents. A proper investigation would not hide under cover of the State of Emergency, or shy away from the clear light of rule of law, Maumoon Hameed, the lawyer for former dictator Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, wrote on Twitter.
Gayoom, now an opposition leader, was among a group of prominent Maldivians arrested last week.
Hamid Abdul Gaffoor, a spokesman for the opposition Maldivian Democratic Party, dismissed the accusations. All you can say is that its a big joke, he said.

Oxfam warned it could lose millions in funding over sex crimes scandal
	

Oxfam announced a new raft of measures to tackle sexual abuse cases after being ordered to meet the British government on Monday to explain its handling of a 2011 prostitution scandal involving its aid workers in Haiti. 
The British-based charity will reexamine the episode as part of an independent review started this year to drive out unacceptable behaviour, while pledging to improving the recruitment, vetting and management of staff. 
It is not sufficient to be appalled by the behaviour of our former staff -- we must and will learn from it and use it as a spur to improvement, Caroline Thomson, Oxfams chair of trustees, said in a statement. 
She confirmed the charity would meet with the Department for International Development (DFID) on Monday and the Charity Commission, which regulates the sector, later this week. 
Earlier Sunday Britains International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt warned Oxfam to cooperate with a renewed probe into the scandal or face repercussions. 
If they do not hand over all the information that they have from their investigation... then I cannot work with them any more as an aid delivery partner -- and any other organisation in those circumstances, she told the BBC. 
In a sign of widening fallout, the Sunday Times reported more than 120 workers for Britains leading charities were accused of sexual abuse in the past year, fuelling fears paedophiles are targeting overseas aid organisations. 
Mordaunt said she was writing to all charities that receive state aid demanding they step up efforts to tackle sexual misconduct among staff or face funding cut-offs.

Thereafter a fixed rate of 14.5 percent will be applicable from 3rd to 5th year and 15.5 percent will be applicable from 6th to 10th year.
Pan Asia Bank Nivasa housing loan can be obtained for multiple purposes including building a house, buying a block of land to build a house, completing, renovating or extending a partially built house, repaying an existing housing loan from a recognized financial institution.
Under this loan scheme customers can obtain loan facilities from 3 million to 25 million with repayment options of up to 25 years.
In order to make it more convenient, the bank has introduced a special hassle free documentation handling service to obtain various clearance certificates from local authorities such as street line and building line clearance certificate, certificate of non-vesting and certificate of ownership.

The United States may be looking more favourably at diplomatic engagement with North Korea, possibly holding dialogue, as South Korea pushes forward with plans to establish grounds for a rare summit between the two Koreas.
Vice President Mike Pence said in a newspaper interview the United States and South Korea had agreed on terms for further diplomatic engagement with North Korea, first with Seoul and then possibly leading to direct talks with Washington without pre-conditions.
The prospect of talks comes after months of tension between Pyongyang, Seoul and Washington over North Koreas nuclear and missile programmes, with U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un trading insults and threats of destruction amid tightening sanctions from the

HINDUSTAN TIMES, 12th FEBRUARY, 2018
Foreign secretary Boris Johnson has sharpened criticism of Myanmars state counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi over the Rohingya issue, doubting if she understood the full horror of the crisis that led the UN to describe it as a textbook case of ethnic cleansing.
Johnson, on a visit to Bangladesh and Myanmar, has been articulating growing concern in London in recent months over the refugee crisis that has seen a large number of Rohingya Muslims flee state persecution from the Myanmars Rakhine state.
After meeting Suu Kyi in Yangon, Johnson told BBC: To be honest, I dont really think she understands the full horror. I dont think she has been up in a helicopter to see what we have seen. I believe in her leadership but am sad to see what is happening to Burma now.

## Title: The death of Sinhala

The death of Sinhala
	
Its fashionable now and then to lament the death of this or that. Most if not much of the time, though, this act of lamenting is a way in which the elders exert and express their superiority over the young, with the most typical excuse trotted out being that the young dont care. Probably no other artefact, treasured by these elders, has been so lamented like this than the mother tongue, Sinhala, with its supposedly impending death. (Since I dont know Tamil, or how its venerated by the old and how the young treat it to the consternation of the old, Im not sure what the situation is over there.)
The elders will confidently point out that the young dont read. True. They dont. No language can be sustained in the long run without recourse to literature and no literature can survive if this demographic refuses to read. Ive pointed out countless times, here and elsewhere, that a nation that doesnt read eventually becomes a nation that doesnt write, and in turn a nation that doesnt produce any critics. This, I think, is truer for English than for Sinhala, because despite all that it has suffered at the hands of a non-reading public the Sinhala press has produced and continues to produce cohesive critics who surpass their English counterparts by a considerable margin. But then the absence of such cohesive critics isnt the only or even the main problem.
When I interviewed the late Ajantha Ranasinghe several years ago, he pointed out that the ability of a lyricist to root the social in the personal has, more or less, been lost today. What we have today, he implied (correctly, I believe), is a set of lyricists (barring the occasional exception) who dilute the social in the personal, which was manifestly different and inferior. What resulted from this was a culture of banality in our literature, where what is puritanically termed as kunuharapa (filth) would be confused for a higher vocabulary. Such kunuharapa is best suited for a very self-referential musical form: rap and baila are the two examples that come to my mind at once. In the long run, however, this can only spell out a deterioration, and not just in music.
A refreshingly novel culture 
Its a vicious circle at one level; if people dont read, their vocabulary is limited, and with a limited vocabulary even the most banal words acquire the status of high-flown erudition. Thats why we are so obsessed, as a people and a culture, over each and every music video and new star that pops up. We think that they will herald something new, something that will do away with the old, but in reality becomes just a rehashed, recycled version of what is considered to be old. This is bad on both fronts; it leaves the young with nothing to work on and the old, especially the puritans, with something which they can engage with in their battle against the young. What is lost is a culture that is refreshingly novel; what is retained is a culture of Puritanism.
I have been overwhelmed and in a good way, by what is advertised as new in our recent popular culture: Sanuka Wickramasinghe, Tehan Perera, the team behind Koombiyo and Sahodaraya, especially the main star in the latter two, Thumudu Dodantanne, and from the movies, Ho Gana Pokuna, Premaya Nam, Adaraneeya Kathawak and Adareyi Mang. There is a freshness in these works that excite the young in a way which leaves the puritans in the dark. What differentiates them from those who precede them is that they are no longer bothered by the need to reject the old. A few months ago, for instance, I reflected on Sanuka and I noted the following: He is a New Voice because he no longer makes it necessary to defy the [old] line to gain new territory.

So where are we today The elders, on the one hand, will continue to lament. As they do. The youngsters, on the other hand, will either defy the elders or try out something constructively new
Theres an honesty in these that transcends their cosmetic artificiality. People are quoting and creating memes out of Koombiyo (though not Sahodarayo) in ways that makes a laughing stock out of the conventional mega-series, though not in a way that makes it evident for us that they are rejecting what preceded them. Its this kind of novelty  they arent bothered by their predecessors and arent paying attention to what the puritans among their elders are doing  which comforts me. But then will this be enough to counter the attacks that the young are enduring, rightly and justifiably, with respect to the death of their own language This brings me to another problem, another issue.
Many of those who market themselves as New eschew the need to be nurtured by literature before embarking on their musical, cinematic, television, and theatrical careers. They are enraptured by the techniques of their craft, but when it comes to the written word, which more than anything else  at times, more than even the visuals  is what captures immediate attention, they are pitifully below par. To a considerable extent this has to do with the fact that at school they have not (and this is what I have picked up from conversations with them) been explicitly encouraged to read. When your language is limited to the grammar you have to memorise, what happens is that your interest in that language is limited to the societies you join, literary, drama, and debating. Even that isnt a guarantee, since very few of those who join such societies continue with what they picked up, and loved, later on.
Doing the hard yards
When neither the school culture nor the popular culture (remember what the former Warden of S. Thomas College, whom I referred to about two weeks ago, said) emboldens the idealists to venture out into the arts with a healthy awareness of language and literature, only an aberration can result. Yes, they may be more than adequately endowed with the ability to transform the most mundane material to a technically and visually rich product, they may be able more than any of their elders to work with the production house, the camera, and Photoshop and Illustrator, because these are physical enterprises and they prefer hard labour, doing the hard yards, over using their imagination in terms of words. This is to be seen in a more insidious form in our vocalists; they are more concerned with the melody, the tone, the correct accent, the correct inflection, than actually making sense of what they are crooning.
If I am talking about music here rather too much the reason is painfully clear; as I noted a month or so back, music is largely self-referential (even when its not a self-referential genre like rap and baila), and its probably the only art form in the world in which the two levels of consciousness  of the producer and of the consumer  are never, even for one instant, dichotomised. What is produced is, simply put, what is consumed, so what is put out is what is digested. Probably second only to television, which is called the idiot box precisely because it has something of this quality (i.e. the ability to make the audience gullibly understand what the producer intends them to understand), the three-minute popular song is the yardstick with which the progress or regression of a language can be measured, today, in virtually any society.
What is exciting about Sanuka is that even in terms of the techniques he uses, he is miles ahead of these depressingly and frequently resorted to clichs of that three-minute song.
He is no longer the star of his own videos; he is not crooning about fulfilled or cruelly denied love, rather about romances that never really pick up (Perawadanak is in that sense more enjoyable than Saragayaye, the latter of which, I am told, spurred certain schoolboys to form up their own schoolboy bands); he never really dilutes the social in the personal, but instead tries to reflect the most potent dreams of romance and young love that we never dare to have.
The same can be said, accounting for the differences in the themes they tackle, with respect to those other examples I pointed out above, not just in music or on television, but in the movies too: Adareyi Mang, for instance, carefully plays around with the tropes of the mainstream romantic film in a way that makes us come back asking for more.
So where are we today The elders, on the one hand, will continue to lament. As they do. The youngsters, on the other hand, will either defy the elders or try out something constructively new despite those lamentations. Munidasa Cumaratunga once wrote that a race that doesnt try out anything new can never hope to reckon with the outside world.
He was correct, I am convinced, particularly when it comes to the best efforts of the old to rein in on the young and the most sincere attempts of the new to pander to those efforts of reining them in by providing the old with excuses to say, The language is dying, and these young artistes, and with them our children, are responsible for its death!
We have a choice here. We either continue with what our predecessors left us in all its pristine forms, or we add to it in a way which appeals to the young and the old alike. Sameness, whether from the elders or the youngsters, ends up promoting a singular vision, the sort that castrates a language of its ability to live, breathe, and flourish. The destiny of a language lies in our hands, and with it the destiny of an entire gamut of art forms, whatever the medium.
