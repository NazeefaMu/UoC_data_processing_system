A maverick left in the lurch!
	
?
A yahapalanaya purohita from Rajarata holding a high post in the party as well had found himself deep in a crisis in the recent past.?
?
It was the decision taken by a section of the party following the recent mini-poll to sit in the opposition along with the JO group-led by the former strongman that plunged him into the crisis.?
The Rajarata man was placed in a very awkward situation, because the way he attacked the former strongman during the recent mini-poll campaign was so harsh that he could not dare think of any truck with the latter in Diyawanna or elsewhere. So he decided to remain in yahapalanaya with the Greens even if the entire Blue set crossed over to the opposition to join hands with the JO group.
Having made his decision, the young Rajarata politico called on the new boss at his official residence to convey his decision.?
However, the new boss? angry reaction to his decision to play lone wolf leaving his pack was something he hardly expected.
The tongue- lashing he got from new boss had stunned him and left him speechless.?
The new boss would have proceeded to take serious action against the Rajarata man if not for the timely intervention of a senior purohita who showed up at this juncture, they say.?

Approach of the SLIM ? Nielsen People?s Awards
	
President of SLIM ? Mr. Karthik Elangovan and Project Chairperson - Mr. Lakshitha Wijesinghe
The most awaited awards program among marketers and brand custodians, which reveals the true place of a brand/organization, is mere weeks away.?
At the approach of the SLIM ? Nielsen People?s Awards, the President of SLIM and the Project Chairperson give us a glimpse into the innovation, influence and inspiration behind one of the most renowned awards in Sri Lanka.?
President of SLIM ? Mr. Karthik Elangovan
What was the thought behind the initiation of the SLIM ? Nielsen People?s Awards?
The idea behind the People?s Awards was to get a non-biased view of a brand?s occupation in the consumers? minds. There are many panel-judged award ceremonies but none of these check the people?s pulse on their preference through a systematic research process, which will capture the true nature of a brand?s imprint in the minds of the consumers.
?Has it achieved the initial objective of creating the award?
?
It has been more than a decade now and organizations as well as the consumers value the true choice of the people, and it helps the companies to improve their performance as well as get an insight into their brand?s bearing in the market, which helps them in their future strategies.
From a consumer point of view, it helps the general population get an idea of the brands most preferred by the consumers, since association by nature is a key component of a human psyche when making purchase decisions. As we all know, one always tends to buy something when it is referred to us by a friend.
These are the two key objectives, which are imperative for People?s Awards recipients and this has been elevated over the years to greater levels with the commercialization of the awards and the acceptance of both the participating organizations and the consumers.? ??
How has the People?s Awards been able to contribute to the marketing fraternity and the country?
The quality of service is one area where the People?s Awards have contributed most.? Products that are placed in the market by organizations need to improve if they are to stand out in the mind of the consumer. So continuous improvements have happened in order to compete for these awards and thus industries have improved areas such as product quality, offerings, channels and communication.? ?
Also, from a marketer?s perspective the awards enable them to understand the consumer?s requirements and strategize accordingly in order to make their brand more appealing to their customers.?
Project Chairperson - Mr. Lakshitha Wijesinghe
What makes the SLIM ? Nielsen People?s Awards stand apart from the many other industry awards?
The selection of the winners in most awards in Sri Lanka is based on either a selection criterion or the judgment of a panel of judges. People?s Awards is the only award where the winners are selected based on island-wide research. More importantly the Nielsen Company carries out the research, which is one of the largest and most recognized research companies in the world. This greatly improves the credibility of the selection process.??
Explain the criteria by which the winners are chosen. How different is it from an evaluation from a panel of judges?
The winners of the People?s Awards are selected based on the Sri Lankan?s top of the mind recall, identified through an island wide research program. The People?s Award tag line, ?The True Voice of Sri Lanka?, clearly projects the essence of the selection criteria. Therefore, this award evaluates the last mile of the brand effort, whether it has been successful in winning the people?s hearts and minds. There is no better testament for the success of a brand than the endorsement of the general public.? In contrast, evaluation by a panel of judges takes in to account the judgment of the panel, which is based on a particular criterion. When it is necessary to scrutinize something in detail that requires in-depth understanding in the respective subject matter, evaluation by a judging panel is suitable.?
How important is public opinion for a brand to be successful?
The success of the brand completely depends on how it is perceived by the public, which includes both its current consumers and non-consumers. The public owns this perception, not the brands.? A brand custodian might want to project a particular image of their brand, but its success depends on whether or not the public perceives it the same way. Every brand manager wants his or her brand to be more loved by the public than any other brand. The People?s Awards put their brands into a test in this aspect.?
What benefits does a brand receive from the SLIM ? Nielsen People?s Awards?
Like I mentioned previously, there is no better testament to the success of the brand than the endorsement of the general public. The People?s Awards confirms that the winning brand is the most popular brand in its category among Sri Lankans. Since the research is carried out by the leading research agency Nielsen, an award is valid anywhere in the world. Winning an award will further drive awareness and usage. We humans always love to be associated with the best and the most popular. Further, the popularity of the brand tells the market about the superior quality of the product/service, which improves the consumer?s confidence in the brand, making it easier and faster for the consumer to traverse through the buying process

Child Protection in Sri Lanka lapses....Right of Reply
	
With reference to our article ?Child Protection in Sri Lanka lapses at NCPA - pose questions about competency,? dated February 22, National Child Protection Authority Chairperson, Marini de Livera has sent the following response. The Daily Mirror as a responsible newspaper which respects rights and views of all parties publishes the letter sent by the NCPA Chairperson.The Excerpts:-
I refer to the news item titled ?Child Protection in Sri Lanka lapses at NCPA - pose questions about competency,? published on February 22, 2018 in the?
Daily Mirror.??
The content under the heading ?Alleged protection of Child Abuser? is false and inaccurate. This concerned an anonymous complaint against an NCPA officer which was received to our 24-hour child-line during the tenure of the previous Chairperson in 2016. The Attorney General [AG] by letter dated 26/12/2017 (WPI/47/2017) has informed the Director of Women and Children?s Bureau of the Police that there is no evidence to institute Criminal Proceedings against the said NCPA Officer. The Director of Women and Children?s Bureau of Sri Lanka Police has informed the Gangodawila Magistrate Courts that on the advice of the AG, the case would be closed. The said officer had also earlier lodged a complaint with the Police Commission and it was incidentally, the Police Commission had directed the Complaint to the AG. It is deplorable that even after the said officer?s name has been cleared by the AG, your newspaper published this misleading and distorted news item without checking the accuracy of its contents.??
Further, you have also made imprecise, untrue statements with regard to the National Child Policy which is being prepared according to provisions of the National Child Protection Authority [NCPA] No. 50 of l998. Public comments were sought with regard to the draft policy and these comments are being incorporated into the final draft of the said policy by a Committee headed by the world-renowned Child Protection Expert and Founder Chairman of NCPA, Prof. Harendra de Silva. The present issues relating to Child Protection too are being incorporated to the policy.??
It is beyond truth to state in your article that there are lapses at the NCPA. The functions of the NCPA are going on smoothly at Central, District and Divisional levels despite the obstacles set by anti-social elements. The 24-hour toll free help line functions 365 days, the special Police investigation team is working round the clock, so are the Surveillance, Video Evidence Recording, Psycho-Social, Law Enforcement, Programme and Legal Units. NCPA personally gets involved in Court Cases Island-wide and appears on behalf of Child victims where it seems that cases are being dragged on. NCPA also intervened and obtained assistance from UNICEF to reduce the huge backlog of cases relating to Child Abuse at the AG?s Department.?
?
It is unpardonable that when the NCPA is functioning so well and endeavouring to serve the community to the best of its ability with such passion and vigour, that a newspaper such as yours instead of partnering with NCPA to promote and protect Child Rights, publishes distorted and fallacious material which could cause the erosion of public trust placed in the institution.??
It is also a fabrication that I stopped and prevented a meeting set up by the NCPA Secretary. It also untrue that salaries of employees were not paid for February 2018.??
Although you have given prominence to ideas of the NCPA union, whereas such a union has not been legitimately recognized by the Board of the NCPA. No information relating to this the composition of union has been received by NCPA so far and there is no intimation to the authority about a genuine industrial dispute.??
I strive hard to do exemplary work in keeping with the rule of law and its allied principle and I wish to state that as Chairperson, I work with all officers and at head office and field officers in the peripheral areas attached to NCPA, and I am not partial towards any officer or employee of NCPA.??

He fears that Geneva is too cold for him!
	
?
The government has received a forewarning that the human rights commission in Geneva is set to take Sri Lanka to task at the annual sessions due next month.
?
Having decided to meet fire with fire, the government leadership had hand-picked a group of officials capable of rising to any occasion for the country?s delegation to Geneva and a yahapalanaya heavyweight to lead it.
The group of officials picked for the delegation had later called on the political heavyweight to discuss their strategy at the Geneva sessions.?
However, the visitors had been aback by the lukewarm attitude of the bigwig. ?I say, how can I go to Geneva these days? They say it is terribly cold there.? My health is such I cannot stand cold weather!? The officials had left the place wondering as to why of all those available fit to fill the bill, this man was chosen to lead the delegation to Geneva.?

A purohita who held high hopes about the party?s showing in his district at the recent mini-poll, had planned to present one tourist bus each to seven schools in the area.?

However, this purohita who took to politics following the footsteps of his great father, founding his political base in a distant district where another family continues to hold sway, suffered a severe setback at the recent mini-poll.?
The defeat at the mini-poll had given the purohita a severe jolt because he had expected the people in the district to be grateful to him for the numerous goodies he had distributed among them ahead of the poll.? Unhappy over the poll result, the purohita had returned the seven tourist buses to their source.
The purohita had learnt a bitter lesson about the people?s unpredictable conduct at elections, they say.?

The Blue party lost to Pohottuwa an electorate in the upcountry which is being looked after by no lesser person than the political chief of the province.
?
The political chief the other day called on the yahapalanaya big boss who is also the party boss with a sheaf of betel to offer his explanation for the poll defeat.?
The moment the provincial political chief showed up, the big boss asked him why he lost the electorate given his high office which enables him to do much for the people.
The provincial political chief offered the sheaf of betel to the big boss, greeted him in the typical oriental fashion and proceeded to give reasons for his defeat.
His explanation was that the governing one of the province was mainly responsible for his defeat because the things she had said and done against him ahead of the poll had greatly undermined the faith people had in him.?
The big boss immediately dismissed with disdain his explanation.
?Isn?t the person you are accusing of undermining your standing with the people, a close relative of yours? Don?t you know how to deal at least with your relatives??
The provincial political chief quietly faded from the scene making no further excuses, they say.?

Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said today the party would support a no-faith motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on the basis that he had not carried out his duties properly and with allegations of fraud and corruption and on allegations of protecting thieves.
However, he also said protecting Mr. Wickremesinghe?s Premiership or helping to continue it was not a matter of the JVP.
He told a news conference that they would consider the political motives of bringing in the no-faith-motion and whether it was brought in as a result of a power struggle or as a political game.
?We will support a no-confidence-motion brought in for certain facts such as Mr Wickremesinghe involved in fraud and corruption and protecting fraudsters.
?We will consider whether the motion was brought in against attempting to appoint Central Bank Governor, being part of the Central Bank Bond issuance, attempting to protect fraud and corruption of the Rajapaksa regime, not allowing Shiranthi Rajapaksa being brought to the CID for defrauding money of the Siriliya Account and protecting certain people, who involved in passport frauds,? he said.

Kachchatheevu An island that promises peace and reconciliation
	
Pix by Pradeep Pathirana
Though the history of St. Anthony?s Church is not clearly known some believe that it was constructed in 1905 by an Indian Catholic named Seenikuppa Padaiyatchi. Chief of Defense Staff Admiral Ravindra Wijegunawardene?s opinion is that it was constructed by Indian fishermen. The Admiral, who gave a brief description of the history of the church, said it had been constructed by Indian fishermen who managed to save their lives after being forced onto the island by a storm. The fishermen who were shipwrecked on the island had constructed the church as a gesture of thanks to St. Anthony, whom they believe saved their lives.??
?
A report published in the Indian Express some time back states that Kachchatheevu was a 285-acre island which was located 17 km away from Rameswaram in India.?
?
According to this report there are historical documents dating back to 1609. According to the report the island belonged to the Sethupathis, a royal family who ruled over the district at the time. Two centuries later, the British officials leased Kachchatheevu and maintained it. After 1947, the island became an owner-less land as the members of the royal family could not claim ownership to it any more under Vallabhbhai Patel?s watch.??
?
The island was never suitable for habitation as there were no basic facilities on it such as water. Neither the army nor the LTTE had occupied the island during the conflict period due to this fact
?
The Indian Government held the island till 1974. It is a fact that Kachchatheevu was handed over to Sri Lanka by the Indira Gandhi led Government of India in 1974 when an agreement was signed in two parts ? on June 26 in Colombo and June 28 in New Delhi. The island was ceded to Sri Lanka, but Indian fishermen were allowed access to Kachchatheevu ?hitherto?. The agreement did not specify fishing rights.??
?
Drafting of the agreement??
After emergency was imposed in 1975 and the Tamil Nadu Government was dismissed in 1976, a series of letters were exchanged between the foreign secretaries of India and Sri Lanka. Both Parliament and the state Assembly were non-functional and, without consulting either, another agreement was drafted. This agreement stated, ?The fishing vessels and fishermen of India shall not engage in fishing in the Exclusive Economic Zone of Sri Lanka.? While the 1974 Agreement was to settle the maritime boundary in the Palk Bay, the 1976 pact was to determine the boundary in the Gulf of Mannar and Bay of Bengal.??
In 1991, the Tamil Nadu Assembly again sought the retrieval of Kachchatheevu and restoration of fishing rights of Tamil fishermen. The Northern Province and maritime boundaries were not guarded tightly, and Indian trawlers routinely entered Sri Lankan waters.??
In 2008, ADMK Leader J. Jayalalitha filed a petition saying Kachchatheevu could not be ceded to another country without a constitutional amendment. The petition argued that the 1974 Agreement had affected the traditional fishing rights and livelihoods of Indian fishermen. After becoming chief minister in 2011, she moved a resolution in the Assembly and in 2012 went back to the Supreme Court requesting her petition be expedited in the wake of increasing arrests of Indian fishermen by the?Sri Lankan authorities.??
The Congress has always been defensive regarding the role of Indira Gandhi?s Government in handing Katchchatheevu to Sri Lanka. Before the Lok Sabha Polls, the BJP endorsed the demand of Tamil parties to restore the island to the state. BJP leaders promised to take measures to revisit the agreement?with Colombo.??
In August 2014, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi told the Supreme Court that the matter was closed, and it would require ?war? to get the island back. ?Katchchatheevu went to Sri Lanka by an agreement in 1974. It was ceded and now acts as a boundary. How can it be taken back today? If you want it back you will have to go to war,? he said at that time.?
?Transit point??
Archbishop Emeritus Oswald Gomis in his book ?Contribution of Catholics for Sri Lanka?s well-being? states that there was a debate regarding the ownership of Kachchatheevu during the post independence era till Prime Ministers Indira Gandhi and Sirimavo Bandaranaike reached an agreement under which the island was handed over to Sri Lanka. The Bishop in this book claims that the island was not a private property. The evidence to suggest that the island was owned by Sri Lanka was provided by the Catholic Church according to Bishop Gomis. It was found out that the buildings in the island were constructed by Catholics. The buildings comprised a church and a mission house. The annual feast of the church was organized by the Jaffna Diocese for many years.
This fact suggests that the island was controlled by Sri Lanka for a long time. Bishop Gomis in his book explains that South Indians, who had secretly migrated to the central hills in Sri Lanka, had used Kachchatheevu as a transit point. The church has been blamed for providing opportunities for illegal immigrants to enter Sri Lanka. This caused the then Bishop of Jaffna, the late Emaliyanas Pillai, to stop celebrating the feast. However the celebration of the feast re-started following the advice of the late Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike some time later.
Accordingly, the priest in charge of the church Fr. J B Devarajah was sent back to the island to take charge of the church once again.??
According to the Sri Lanka Navy the island was never suitable for habitation as there were no basic facilities on it such as water. Neither the army nor the LTTE had occupied the island during the conflict period due to this fact.??
Due to Indian politicians calling on their Government to reclaim the island and Sri Lanka claiming ownership of Kachchatheevu, the Island has become a catalyst on the lines of reconciliation among Sinhalese and Tamils in Sri Lanka.
The festive mass of the annual feast was conducted in both Sinhalese and Tamil for the first time this year. The event serves as a platform for peoples of the two neighbouring countries to meet at least once a year to venerate the saint they both believe in. This was evident with the visit of 1920 Indian Catholics to the feast this year. Among them were six Indian priests who were led by Fr. Anthoney Swamy of St. Joseph?s Church in Wellapudu, Rameshwaram. Some of the Indian fishermen who visited called for a peaceful settlement to the fishermen?s issue between Sri Lanka and India. Apart from the Indians more than 7000 people from Sri Lanka had arrived for the feast. People were seen roughing it out by lying down on mats laid among the shrubs.??
Both Bishop Justin Gnanapragasam of Jaffna and Bishop Raymond Wickramasinghe from Galle, who jointly conducted the festive mass, called for reconciliation in Sri Lanka. ?We have been wounded by a war, but a miracle has happened today as a bishop from the South had been invited to participate in the mass at this Kachchatheevu Church for the first time in its history. It is important to share peace with everyone and give life to the Bible. The Bible is not just a book read by Christians which can always give life to it by living a kind of life which it recommends,? Bishop Wickramasinghe said. He added that there is no point in talking of reconciliation if people cannot love each other. Bishop Gnanapragasam also called for reconciliation and lauded the Navy and the Government for facilitating the devotees who visited the island for the feast.??
Mariyam Pushpam, a middle aged woman, said she visited the church to offer thanks to St. Anthony for granting her a wish. ?I came here last year and asked St. Anthony to give me and my family a chance to go on a pilgrimage to The Vatican. I have got an opportunity to visit The Vatican and I came here to thank the dear saint with my three sons,? she said. Mariyam had arrived in a boat from Chilaw. Maxwell Perera, from Ja-Ela, said that he came to Jaffna by road and then proceeded towards Kachchatheevu by boat. He thanked the Navy and the security forces for providing people with the facilities needed on their visit to the island. He said that he was happy to venerate the saint together with the Indian devotees.??
There are historical documents dating back to 1609. According to the report the island belonged to the Sethupathis, a royal family who ruled over the district at the time
Chief of Defense Staff Admiral Ravindra Wijegunawardene said that he attended the mass also as a devotee. ?I was sailing with my crew several years ago in the Northern waters and got caught in a storm. The boat nearly capsized. I began to think of St. Anthony for some reason and we were saved. I began to have faith in St. Anthony from that day onwards. I have attended the feast since then without fail,? he said.??
Accordingly it was clear that the military personnel and devotes from both India and Sri Lanka had visited Kachchatheevu for two main purposes; to venerate a saint and pray for peace. Peace prevailed in Kachchatheevu on that day, but will it prevail in the island of Sri Lanka???

Kings and Pawns on our political chessboard
	
Defeat for the governing party at local govt polls is not the norm
Maithripala did not become SLFP leader in a succession struggle
SLFP does not have any example to follow
Recent polls? passed a different kind of verdict on the President?s leadership
?I am not an old, experienced hand at politics. But I am now seasoned enough to have learned that the hardest thing about any political campaign is how to win without proving that you are unworthy of winning?~Adlai E. Stevenson?
This is a sequel to my previous column. In an utterly unclear and uncertain, yet potentially explosive endgame, pieces that are being moved and re-moved on the political chessboard, seem to be many and diverse. Who is moving and who was moved is now obvious.The much-talked about reshuffle became an anti-climax of shameful proportions. Once again, our political leaders have resorted to the easy way out. Band-Aid solutions are the refuge of the mediocre. They promise instant relief of pain and discomfort. But their temporary nature is known only to the manufacturer of Band-Aid product. Complex issues and malignant diseases are not cured by simpleton-remedies. Defeat for the governing party at local government elections is not the norm. It is an exception. By-elections are different as they are held for parliamentary seats and, more often than not, are held as a referendum on the sitting powers. People vote at the local government elections as a means to strengthen their chances to ?get things done? at the local level as it seems that the governing party could help each local authority if the power in the local authority is held by those who represent the governing coalitions.? ?
Yet the current coalition government managed to convert the recently held local government elections into a referendum on the continuance of their power at the centre. Clever politicians who are in power have learnt not to offer the electorate a binary choice. It always goes against the power holders. It?s the opposition that gains from a binary choice because the opposition manages to define the issues in their own terms. It is a fundamental in politics in general and in electioneering in particular that the party that controls the national conversation controls the election issues. In the absence of an aggressive media thrust, tumbling of control of discussion to the rival is normal. It is this fundamental aspect of politics that the Ranil/Maithri duo have not understood, it seems. Ranasinghe Premadasa was a master of controlling the national discussion and in the current global context, Donald Trump showing how it could be done even to a crude end in a cruder manner. Lalith Athulathmudali too in the United National Party (UNP)-led government, time and time again proved the validity and incalculable advantage of control of the?national conversation.? ?
Examples and precedents are aplenty and many. One has to learn from such mind-expanding experiences. Instead, it seems that our leaders have got bogged down in retail politics, without being proactive, always reacting to the opposition. This mind-screwing exercise has crippled the nuanced aspects of political thinking, making them total slaves to meandering beings with no clear view of their journey and no clear objectives at the end of such meaningless journeys. It is indeed a tragedy beyond compare. When textbook precedents and modalities are available at their bidding, why these so-called experienced political leaders don?t avail themselves of the wisdom of such clever modus operandi could be sourced only to one inescapable reason: deliberate casting aside of such methods and means due to the insecure and brittle structure of their own weak minds.? ?
In such unfortunate circumstances, the brighter and bold ones would resort to extremely innovative measures, which to some observers appear as bordering on political adventurism. Yet action needs to be taken on an urgent basis as a non-political matter. It is in that sphere of political calculus the current reshuffle of the Cabinet of Ministers is being observed. The internal adjustments and revamping of the workings of each Party, namely the United National Party and Sri Lanka Freedom Party are on the table, so to speak.? ?
Defeat for the governing party at local govt elections is not the norm. It is an exception. By-elections are different as they are held as a referendum on the sitting powers
Both political parties are being manned by politicos at the highest levels. The SLFP had been following that pattern from their birth to date. However, the UNP, after JR Jayewardene took over its reins, departed from its traditional path and he introduced a novel system of the key portfolios of the party machinery being handled by non-politicians who did not have a vested interest in who becomes what Minister and who would not. That division, a clear and unambiguous disunion between those who run the government and those who run the Party lent a rich and distinct character to the structure of a political entity bent on coming to power and sustaining it on a very scientific and modern footing.? ?
Being burdened with numerous tasks and demands on their respective portfolios, a Minister has hardly any spare time to attend to his own personal family matters. How the heck he finds the time to run the administrative affairs of his political party with no prejudicial interests riding into his decisions and unforgivable procrastination of crucial decisions that need to be taken in regard to appointment of an organizer in this district and another party sympathizer that needs to be taken is beyond the pale. As a result of politicos occupying the positions of Chairman and Secretary of the party will result in forced cancellation of appointments, in procrastination of some others, and in an inevitable sense of prejudice running into his decisions and because he would be forced to safeguard his vested interests.? ?
Whichever way one looks, it is more than obvious that the present arrangement is not conducive to a just, fair and beneficial arrangement for the Party. If one does not accept such an obvious truth, it is more than tragic. It is treacherous.? ?
Maithripala Sirisena did not become the leader of the SLFP in a succession struggle. His capture of Presidency, thanks mainly to the UNP, Tamils and Muslims in Sri Lanka, after defeating the then leader of the SLFP
As far as the official SLFP is concerned, it is even worse. The Sri Lanka Freedom Party does not have any example to follow. It never had a leader who could see far enough-in the broad context of the country?s advance in democratic principles and structures- to establish a system where there is always room at the top. The SLFP is a political entity that has been centred on family rule. After the Bandaranaikes, it revolved around the Rajapaksas. Holding subservient attachments to the Man or Woman at the top and currying favour with other members of the ?First Family? was a ready-made passport, not to climb the hierarchical ladder of succession, but to receive residual good-effects, or more bluntly put, bones with a residue of meat. Maithripala Sirisena did not become the leader of the SLFP in a succession struggle. His capture of Presidency, thanks mainly to the UNP, Tamils and Muslims in Sri Lanka, after defeating the then leader of the SLFP, paved the way for him to be named the leader. The recently concluded local government elections passed a different kind of verdict on his leadership. The Family-oriented party decided that it would remain so-a party leadership stubbornly entrenched in family rule. The grassroots of the SLFP decided that they would rather be led by a set of family members, however corrupt and dishonest they are.? ?
Yet the current coalition government managed to convert the recently held local government elections into a referendum on the continuance of their power at the centre
But the cruel truth is that the majority of Sinhalese Buddhists are with the ?Family Rule?. Such clannish tendencies on the part of our main component of population, its obstinate allegiance to a cult of personality were broken in 1977. But that was after a long, cleverly structured drive led by strong and unbending personalities who were willing to make enormous and unthinkable sacrifices. Genghis Khan once stated that ?It is not sufficient that I succeed, all others must fail?. Leaders in any field, whether in politics or any other must follow that recipe. That is the core element in JR Jayewardene?s leadership. He not only succeeded. He also saw to it that others failed. Such results are reaped in whatever circumstances, whether in a context of social media and instant news being available to all or not, with devotion to a selected way of pursuit without ?taking prisoners? along the way.? ?
The delay in bringing justice to the wrong-doers of the last regime is very much in the mind of the voter. The very platform on which the current President was voted in and a majority of UNPers elected to parliament
It is not possible to win elections without hard work. Both the UNP and SLFP realized that unpalatable political dynamic at enormous cost to themselves. For the UNP, it is palpably clear that, in order to attract a majority of the Sinhalese Buddhist voting bloc, needs to indicate, in whatever manner the leader chooses, to name as to who is going to succeed Ranil. A clear indication is of paramount significance, especially in the context of the murky picture that has been painted around Ranil Wickremasinghe, the current leader of the UNP.? ?
However, the UNP, after JR Jayewardene took over its reins, departed from its traditional path and he introduced a novel system of the key portfolios of the party machinery being handled by non-politicians who did not have a vested interest in who becomes what Minister and who would not
The delay in bringing justice to the wrong-doers of the last regime is very much in the mind of the voter. The very platform on which the current President was voted in and a majority of UNPers elected to parliament was this nagging demand of the voter, punishment to the Rajapaksas who attempted to perpetuate a corrupt family clan in power. The core of the public demand needs to be satisfied. There is no doubt that the Prime Minister took over the Ministry of Law and Order on a temporary measure. There is still hope that this Ministry would end up in the hands of a person who is a?proven deliverer.? ?

The Northern Provincial Council (NPC) yesterday passed a resolution to request the UNHRC to establish an International Court to look into the alleged war crimes committed by the armed forces during the wartime in the province.
The resolution, which was submitted by Councillor M.K. Shivajilingam, was passed with a majority at the 117th council session held at the Provincial Council premises at Kaithady.
Mr Shivajilingam said the government had failed to probe into war crime charges though the UNHRC had requested it?to do so during the previous UNHRC sessions in Geneva.
?A probe by the Government to solve human rights violations cannot be trusted. Since the latest UNHRC session has begun, a resolution should be sent to it,? he said. (Romesh Madushanka)

PM pledges to declare war on drugs
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who took over the Ministry of Law and Order few days ago pledged to declare war against drugs yesterday.
The Prime Minister made this pledge at a ceremony held to mark the 35th anniversary of STF which also coincided with the passing out of 169 STF personnel l at Katukurunda Police straining school last evening.
?We have to stop the drug trafficking and distribution. You cannot be soft on drugs. We have to be strict with it. If there is one loop-hole that will do a great damage. In USA they say you cannot be soft on drugs whether you are law enforcement institution, whether you are administering justice or doing correction services. Therefore let us not be soft on drugs,? he said.
Pledging to bring in strict laws to curb drugs, the Prime Minister said he will discuss bringing in new laws with the Attorney General. ?Some laws pertaining to drug trafficking, illegal use of drugs and other laws pertaining to the police have become outdated and we need to modify these laws. I will discuss this matter with the Attorney General and other stake holders on the matter,? he added.
Mr. Wickremesinghe said a Buddhist monk once told him that the country is currently facing an issue which is more dangerous than terrorism. ? I asked this monk as to what he was talking about, he told me that it was drugs trafficking which had spread all over the country. He advised me to focus on this issue and save the youth from this social ill ,? he said.
He recalled that STF was first established in the 1980s when police stations in the North were overrun by the terrorists. STF was established to protect the police stations. Terrorists were not successful in attacking police stations during the war after STF was established. He said Sri Lankan STF is a role model for many other countries. The Prime Minister said this while highlighting that Sri Lanka is the first country in Asia to introduce a national police force. He therefore urged the STF personnel to safeguard its reputation.
IGP Pujith Jayasundara told the newly passed out officers not to engage in acts which tarnishes the image of STF. ?Perform your duty towards the nation with zest and pride,? he told the officers.
Commanding officer of STF M. R. Latheef paid tribute to the founder of STF late Ravi Jayewardene and 483 STF personnel who had sacrificed their lives in the war since 1987. A commemorative coin was issued to mark the STF anniversary while two books were also launched. One is about the history of STF and the other about the history of the police. (Yohan Perera)

Power Ministry wants Rs.2.5 Bn to buy extra electricity
	
The Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy has submitted a Cabinet paper requesting for Rs.2.5 billion to purchase supplementary electricity from private power generating sources. Sources said the document was submitted by Minister Ranjith Siyamabalapitiya at the Cabinet meeting presided over by the President yesterday.
The request for the immediate purchase 100 megawatts of electricity was made because of the drought which prevailed in the country and because of the delay in constructing new power plants.
Sources said the electricity is to be purchased from the private sector at a cost of Rs.28.20 a unit.
Meanwhile, Ministry Secretary Dr. Suren Batagoda confirmed that the ministry planned to purchase as a buffer stock.
?Yes we want to purchase 100 megawatts at Rs.28.20 per unit. This is to fulfil the requirements for buffer stock of electricity and ensure there was no sudden shortage, like this country experienced with fertiliser and oil,? he said.
Dr. Batagoda said power was currently purchased at prices between Rs.30 and 35 per unit and that intended purchase was economical to the ministry. (Ajantha Kumara Agalakada)

Highly dismayed that his supplications to the gods in yahapalanaya have proved fruitless, the man has begun making them to those in the heavens.
Furious that all his appeals to the bigwigs in yahapalanaya had fallen on deaf ears, he prayers are directed more at punishing the latter than at restoring him to his previous glory, they say.?
Nowadays the politico is reportedly spending most of his time in devalayas and Kovils holding Poojas and other rituals to invoke the intervention of the deities. Whenever, he visits a devalaya or a Kovil, his personal aides accompanying him would invariably carry a bag of coconuts for the coconut breaking ritual to curse his ?enemies? including bigwigs who have failed to help him.?

When the trial of two cases filed against Shashi Weerawansa for holding diplomatic and general passports illegally, were taken up before the Colombo Chief Magistrate?s Court yesterday, the eleventh witness of the case, former Commissioner of the Department for Registration of Persons Jagath Wijeweera informed Court that he gave special instructions to approve Shashi Weerawansa?s application based on trust, regardless of necessary documents being not furnished.
He told the Court that former Minister Wimal Weerawansa had personally contacted him and said that Shashi Weerawansa had lost all her documents when they shifted to their new residence in Colombo 07 and she has to obtain a new ID immediately.
Mr. Wijeweera also said that he had issued a special written statement to the approval section of the Department, noting that Shashi Weerawansa had lost all her relevant documents and she would submit them later.
Accordingly, Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara fixed the two cases for further trial on April 23.
Shashi Weerawansa was arrested in February, 2015 over the charge of obtaining diplomatic and general passport illegally. She had allegedly submitted birth certificates with forged names and dates of birth to obtain those passports. She is currently out on bail.

Shungite ? The stone with the power to protect
	
In the highly techno centric life we live today, we are equally aware of our dependence on electrical and technical equipment as well as the health hazards in the extensive usage of it. However, the negative aspects are often neglected to give way to convenience. Therefore, would it not be ideal to have a source that would eliminate all negative rays that emit from such equipment that we surround ourselves with, like computers, mobile phones and microwaves??
Shungite, a 2 billion year old mineral, discovered in the 1700s in Shunga, in the Karelia area in Russia has proven to be the answer to our need. This ancient stone with several beliefs to its origin is claimed to be one of the only known natural sources of Fullerenes (a powerful anti-oxidant). The stone attracted attention when a group of scientists won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1996 for their study on Fullerenes.?
The high concentration of Fullerenes in Shungite embodies energy in the stone, which is capable of eliminating anything that is a health hazard to the human body, including acting as a shield against electromagnetic radiation from electrical equipment. It is also believed to have active metaphysical properties with strong healing powers. For centuries, Fullerenes has been used to cleanse water. It is also found as an ingredient in skin care products, balms, hair care products as well as building products and paint.?
Taking these elements into consideration, Dimensions has introduced the latest Shungite Phone Platesto Sri Lanka. These plates can simply be placed at the back of a mobile phone or its cover since it comes with adhesive. The plate successfully neutralizes harmful electromagnetic waves, which affect one?s energetic balance, and cerebral and auditory functions. It is able to correct and transform the waves into biocompatible emanation and does so continuously because Shungite does not become saturated or take on a negative charge. The plate can also be instrumental in providing powerful and positive energetic effects, which result in relieving stress and irritation, increasing productivity and performance, and contributing to psycho-emotional balance.
In addition, Shungite is at present been investigated for several potential industrial uses such as in solar generating devices where it could replace silicone to screen off damage caused by Ultra Violet rays. It can possibly help healing allergic conditions, including asthma. The Shungite stone can be found in different classes, the Noble or Elite Shungite, a.k.a. the Silver Shungite, being the one with the highest concentration of Carbon and Fullerenes.
In a more mystical sense, Shungite is believed to be good to keep within one?s aura since its deep primordial energy brings ancient spirits into the process in a protective role. Furthermore, it infuses the auric field with light and allows only positive and beneficial energy to reach you, and its ancient energy apparently provides psychic protection. Therefore, Shungite is a helpful stone, which can be worn as jewelry or kept closer to oneself.?
Shungite stones are available at Dimensions, situated at No. 555/2/b/2, Kaduwela Road, Thalangama North, Battaramulla. For more details, please contact 0710707070 or dimensionslk@gmail.com

The Art of Making it Rain
	
Rain-making method developed by Thai monarch set to ease dry spells in Sri Lanka
It is no mystery that prolonged dry spells have caused difficulties for power generation in Sri Lanka. While sporadic rains in several parts of the island have brought much needed relief, officials have long warned that the conditions of drought would be unrelenting for many areas.? ?
According to Power and Energy Ministry spokesman Sulakshana Jayawardenathe generation of hydro power has been a challenge as water levels at reservoirs are currently around an estimated 59%. 1,350MW of Sri Lanka?s total power capacity, is generated employing large scare hydro-power plants while another 350 MW is generated by small-scale hydro-power plants. The Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy together with the Ceylon Electricity Board is attempting to remedy this state of affairs by ?making? rain.? ?
?Sri Lanka usually expects precipitation during the two monsoon seasons, namely the North-East and South-West monsoons. Over the past two years however we didn?t receive sufficient rain which caused difficulty in producing energy. With this experience, the Ministry decided to explore the possibility of rainmaking,? he said.?
?
What is rainmaking?
Humans have been attempting to control weather since ancient times. ?Rainmaking? isn?t just an indigenous ritual to invoke rains practised by many ancient cultures. Rainmaking is also a scientific weather modification process or a technique of intentionally manipulating the atmosphere, backed by years of research. It involves a process of impregnating clouds to instigate the precipitation process.? ?
We requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to assist us in bringing down expertise from other countries where rainmaking is used for diverse purposes, including agriculture. Out of many countries where cloud seeding is practised, Thailand was selected on the premise that they assisted us to create rain in Sri Lanka when the island was struck with a severe drought in 1981
?Our attempt was to induce rains during the monsoons and not to create ?artificial? rain during the dry seasons. During the monsoons there are ideal cloud conditions, but most often we experience no rain. The challenge is to create enough rainfall in the catchment areas where the major reservoirs are located, namely the Samanala Wewa, Castereigh, Kotmale, Randenigala and Victoria reservoirs,? Jayawardena explained? ?
?If we receive rainfall as expected we can use it during the dry season when water is scarce. There have been many misconceptions about this project as some have mistakenly reported that we will induce rain during the dry seasons. This is not our objective,? the spokesperson stressed.? ?
Sri Lanka experienced heavy rains in areas such as Kalutara, Galle and Matara, even causing floods and widespread destruction. However this precipitation is of no avail as it is not received in catchment areas in the central highlands.? ?
They visited the reservoirs Maussakele, Castlereagh, Victoria and Kotmale to gather data for the feasibility study.? With the preliminary findings presented towards the end of the visit, the experts had concluded that rainmaking was a possibility in Sri Lanka
??We requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to assist us in bringing down expertise from other countries where rainmaking is used for diverse purposes, including agriculture. Out of many countries where cloud seeding is practised, Thailand was selected on the premise that they assisted us to create rain in Sri Lanka when the island was struck with a severe drought in 1981,? Jayawardena said. At that time the project was carried out by several stakeholders including the Sri Lanka Air Force, Ceylon Electricity Board, Meteorological Department and the Mahaweli Authority.? ?
A delegation of five engineers including the Director General of Department of Royal Rainmaking and Agricultural Aviation (DRRAA) arrived in the island on Monday. (February 22). Following a knowledge sharing session, the experts embarked on a fact finding mission in Central Highlands where a drastic drop in water levels has been recorded. They visited the reservoirs Maussakele, Castlereagh, Victoria and Kotmale to gather data for the feasibility study.? ?
With the preliminary findings presented towards the end of the visit, the experts had concluded that rainmaking was a possibility in Sri Lanka. ?The experts agreed to share their knowledge with us. We are now in the process of obtaining Cabinet approval to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the two countries to proceed with this venture,? Jayawardena said.? ?
The project is expected to be expensive. However Jayewardene noted that expenditure estimates have not been drafted as the two countries are still examining the feasibility. ?The Thai team requested that weather information be provided from the Sri Lankan authorities. They noted that existing aircraft in possession of the Sri Lanka Air Force can be used with some digital modifications for this project,? he said.? ?
Over the course of the next month, a Sri Lankan team will visit Thailand to observe the practical methodology of cloud seeding. ?They agreed to host Sri Lankan professionals, so that we can receive the practical exposure to their technology before we embark on the project,? Jayawardena said.?
??
Cloud seeding
The study of the height of the clouds, humidity, wind flow and other weather information are some prerequisites for the act of rainmaking. Officials at the Department of Meteorology will collaborate with this project by providing technical assistance. An officer of the Met Department said they would assist this project in providing details such as atmospheric data. Speaking on the concerns raised over the project the Met Department said that the project is likely to result in positive outcomes rather than negative. However the Met Department official said as weather is inherently an uncertain phenomenon, caution should be exercised as theory may differ from reality.?
?The Thai experts are in possession of the scientific know-how and the technology. We do not know of the result until it is practically applied,? the officer cautioned.? ?
As of February 21, 91, 858 families across five districts: Puttlam, Kurunegala, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Mannar have been affected by this drought. Even though change of weather patterns possesses a greater challenge to countries highly dependent on agriculture such as Sri Lanka, it is not alone in grappling with the issue.? ?
According to the World Meteorological Organization, more than 50 countries across the world have adopted operational programmes to modify the weather.?
Dubbed cloud seeding programmes are often carried out by 34 private weather modification companies in countries including the United States, China, Indonesia, Russia and several Middle Eastern and?European countries.?
?
History?
?
Thailand?s rainmaking techniques however share an interesting historical account with the country?s beloved monarch who ruled the country from 1946 until his demise in 2016. Late King Bhumibol Adulyadej was adored by his countrymen for he was the definition of royal benevolence. One area he was particularly interested in constantly improving was agriculture.? ?
Disaster statistics from the 1900s to 2000s indicated that the droughts affected more than 10 million people in Thailand. The country was affected by droughts frequently and repeatedly, raising the need to address the issue immediately. In 1955, during a visit to the remote north-eastern provinces, the King had observed how cloudy conditions were ideal for rain, yet failed to produce any precipitation.? ?
In 1969 the first trial of the artificial rain carried out under the supervision of the King himself was hailed a success. Rainfall was recorded in targeted areas in Pak Chong District, Nakhon Ratchasima and subsequently known as the Royal Rainmaking Project. In 1999, Bhumibol discovered an innovative technique to gain more cloud density and increase the amount and extent of rainfall. He named the new cloud-seeding technique ?Super Sandwich?.? ?

The Thai King was the world?s first monarch to apply for and be granted a patent for this own invention in 2003. The success has led to the establishment of the Thai Department of Royal Rainmaking and Agricultural Aviation, involved with design and implementation of a series of experiments which resulted in the establishment of five Royal Rainmaking operations centre in every region of the country.? ?
The Director of the National Centre for Meteorology and Seismology in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Dr. Abdullah Al Mandoos more than once cautioned that ?any country with a plan to implement cloud seeding projects requires to investigate the physical and chemical properties of the frequent and available clouds in their territory.? Despite decades of research and success stories, scepticism divides scientists and Governments on cloud seeding -especially due to the challenge of verifying the efficacy of the technique, establishing cause and effect and the overall variability of weather systems.? ?

The bombs stop falling in Syria... for five hours
	
?
Russia has ordered a five-hour ?humanitarian pause? in the Syrian rebel-held enclave of eastern Ghouta near Damascus. The truce has been set up to allow civilians to leave eastern Ghouta, after an eight-day surge of government bombardment has killed more than 500 people, including more than 120 children, according to reports.??
However, human rights workers claim that while there has been no violence in Ghouta, there have been no immediate signs of any corridors set up for people to use.? The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said calm had generally prevailed in eastern Ghouta overnight, though four rockets had hit the nearby town of Douma in the morning before the five-hour window began at 9am local time (7am GMT).?
The Russian defence ministry said on Monday the measures, decided in agreement with Syrian forces, were intended to help civilians leave and to evacuate the sick and wounded. A spokesperson for the international Red Cross said that in order for a humanitarian corridor to work, it needs to be well planned and implemented with the consent of all parties in the conflict.? ?
The five-hour respite announced by the Syrian government?s Russian ally, is nowhere near the month-long ceasefire ordered by the UN this weekend.Eastern Ghouta is a rebel stronghold on the edge of the capital Damascus which has been outside government control since 2012 and is thought to be home to some 400,000 civilians.?

When leadership training moves from daredevilry to death
	
School principal dies during ?Rope Climbing?
Rope climbing is a sport in which competitors attempt to climb up a suspended vertical rope using only their hands. Rope climbing is practiced regularly at the World Police and Fire Games.? ?
In Sri Lanka, with more emphasis on leadership training, the youth who are aspiring to become future leaders are wooed to undergo various types of physical training, some of which are indoor and most of it being outdoors.
School principals are also ?roped? into these physical training activities in the expectation that they would pass on their experiences to their students who are being groomed as future leaders.? ?
The former Principal of Tzuchi National school Rohini Kumari Atapattu (52), the mother of four daughters, opted to undergo this training as she felt that it would help her brighten the future of so many children. She thought that the training would help her to widen their outlook and also make them successful future leaders. In the aftermath of the Tsunami, the Taiwan Government?s Tzuchi Foundation launched the Tzuchi village in Hambantota to provide those displaced people with houses. This foundation established the Tzuchi National School as a gift to the children of this village affected by the Tsunami. Inaugurated as the Tzuchi National School it was soon added to the National School chain of the Education Ministry.? ?
Rohini became the second Principal of this school. She was the wife of Thilakarathne Abeysinghe an administrative officer serving at the Hambantota District Secretariat. They were residing in a rented house in Mayurapura Hambantota. They had purchased a plot of land in Mayurapura with the idea of constructing a house of their own.?
?
The accident?
Rohini had been participating at a leadership training in Wariyapola in the Kurunegala District. During one of the events which was Rope Climbing, she had lost her grip of the rope when attempting to come down. She had lost her balance in the process and fell to the ground sustaining injuries to her head. She had been rushed to the Kurunegala hospital, but was later transferred to the National Hospital Colombo where she passed away.? ?
Her husband stricken with grief and shock related the events of this pathetic episode.? ?
?We lost a mother under very unfortunate circumstances. My earnest request is to conduct an inquiry into this incident. As a Government servant I have reason to believe that sufficient security measures had not been adhered to by the authorities. I have my suspicions regarding this issue. My wife had taken part in many training programmes held in Rantembe and Kuda Oya. She informed me that security systems were very good at these locations. When she was notified of this programme, she asked for my permission. Despite there being some shortcomings we agreed . Now I demand justice for the sake of my four daughters. The eldest Lakshani, is a trained laboratory technician, the second Dilini a trained nurse, the third Piumi is HNBIT and the youngest Isiri sat for her O/Level Examination. My wife had much dreams about their futures. I do not know how they are going to be realized,? said Abeysinghe.?
Lakshani in a tearful manner stated that her mother had looked after the members of the family so well and that they can?t get over her absence. They were anxiously awaiting the day when they would move into their own house
?
Shattered hopes?
Lakshani in a tearful manner stated that her mother had looked after the members of the family so well and that they can?t get over her absence. They were anxiously awaiting the day when they would move into their own house. These hopes are now shattered.? ?
Rohini?s mother, being unable to bear the news of the tragic accident, said that the deceased was the first of four children she had mothered. She received her appointment in 1987 to the Deduwala school. After obtaining her external degree she functioned as the Principal and later was appointed as the Principal of Tzuchi National School. She said that she just could not understand the logic behind providing an army training?to principals.? ?
The Hambantota Zonal Director of Education A.G. Samanthi, speaking to the media, said that as Tzuchi National School also came under the ambit of national schools, this academic institute too was listed for the training programme. ?This programme is conducted by the Human Resources unit of the National Schools. It is a pity that we lost a skilled Principal in the process,? said Samanthi.?

?
The Divisional Secretary of the The Ceylon Teachers Association Hambantota M.P.S. Chinthaka demanded an investigation into this unfortunate death of the principal. The authorities should first look into the shortcomings presently experienced at all schools before deploying Principals to do ?Rope Climbing?. Instead of forcing them to undergo military training they should provide training in human relations and tap the physical resources that are available. It is regrettable to known that the authorities had not learned a lesson from the earlier death of another Principal during a training of this type.?

Why? Oh! Why?
	
The senior purohita long aspiring to wear the prime ministerial mantle rang up his astrologer -? a fair one ? soon after his latest disappointment.?
?
?Highly dismayed and dejected that the much coveted plum job was almost within his reach this time round when it was suddenly snatched away, the man turned to the faithful astrologer for solace.? After all, numerous Poojas and other rituals conducted on her advice and guidance should produce some result, he thought.?
He wanted to know why certain bigwigs who held out hope for him let him down at the eleventh hour. ?Why? Oh! Why?? he lamented.
The woman who got on the defensive had explained quoting chapter and verse that his own misconduct had sent? ?all her settings awry. As the woman began giving a list of his faults and foibles, the purohita had rung off saying that they could discuss all that later, they say.

Yala Gemunu loses one tusk in fight
	
The Yala National Park today confirmed that the majestic tusker known as Gemunu in the sanctuary had lost one of its tusks following an attack by two other single tuskers a few days ago.
According to Yala National Park officials, Gemunu had been attacked at the Sandun Oruwa area near Menik River.
The well-known tusker Gemunu, had earned the reputation of getting close to safari jeeps in search of food.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Deputy Park Warden Ranjith Sisira Kumara who was attached to the Yala Range-II said the tusker was attacked by tuskers known as Sando and Perakum, who are also, interestingly, single tuskers.
According to Yala Wild life database, records indicate that there are five single tuskers living in the sanctuary and them always known to be violent and try to attack others.
?The first three months of each year, elephants come out from the deep jungle for mating and for foods. Several herds come out from the jungle and single tusker elephants also follow them,? Mr Sisira Kumara said.
During the mating season, many single tuskers mostly males challenge other males.
A special team had been sent to the scene in-search for the broken tusk. (Chaturanga Samarawicrama)
