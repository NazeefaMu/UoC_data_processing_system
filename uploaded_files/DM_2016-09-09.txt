ADBs tie-up to open more market borrowings for HNB: Moodys
	
Last weeks Asian Development Banks (ADBs) investment in Hatton National Bank PLCs (HNB) stock will open up further market borrowing opportunities for the latter with increased access to longer tenor funds, according to Moodys Investors Service.
Last week ADB decided to invest US $ 50 million in an approximately 10 percent stake in HNB  the first such investment by ADB in a Sri Lankan bank.
The tie-up with ADB, the first for a Sri Lankan bank, will likely further improve the maturity profile of HNBs market borrowings by facilitating market access for longer-tenor funds, the rating agency said in a brief note.
The fresh capital will improve the Tier I capital base of the bank and the funds will be used to expand the loan book, as the demand for credit still remainshigh. 
The bank grew its loan book by 23 percent year-on-year during the six months to June and this higher credit growth, which picked up from 2014, had weighed on the Tier I capital.
However, the fresh capital will put HNBs Tier I  which increased to pro-forma 11.5 percent from 10.2 percent as of June 30  ahead of both State lenders as well as Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC.
HNB has a credit rating of B1, Negative, from Moodys.
The transaction is expected to be completed during the fourth quarter of 2016 after approval is received from the Colombo Stock Exchange and the HNB shareholders.
HNB, Sri Lankas second largest private lender by assets, in recent times has leaned on market borrowings to fund the strong demand for lending.
The funds raised from the market boosted its assets to 14.4 percent as at June 30, 2016 from 10.6 percent at end 2014 with the share of its long-term tenor funds increasing from 43 percent to 64 percent.
ADB in 2015 loaned US $ 100 million 7-year facility to HNB, which caused this strength in the maturity profile of the market funding portfolio.
we expect that additional long-term funds could become available to HNB from international investors, Moodys opined.
Sri Lankas banks and finance companies, in particular, in recent times have raised capital from emerging market funds and international capital markets to fund the aggressive growth in lending, over and above the deposits they raised.
This was further exacerbated by the Central Bank credit created through printed money.
In July however, Sri Lanka tightened its monetary policy for the third time for the year by hiking the key policy rates by 50 basis points to soften the growth in credit to the private sector.
The treasury bill and bonds rates have been easing lately and the liquidity shortage has also ended with the Central Bank buying dollars.
The foreigners have also returned to the government securities, but not at the pace seen before the surprise 50 basis point rate cut in April 2015, which chased away most of the foreigners who held Lankan rupee bonds.
Meanwhile, Moodys said the ADBs funding support to HNB is credit positive as it not just increases the capital buffers but also the banks loss absorption buffer.
The issuance also increases HNBs loss-absorption buffer. Its ratio of nonperforming loans to total shareholders equity and loan loss reserves will decrease to 12.5 percent after the capital raise from 13.4 percent at end June 2016.
This provides an additional buffer in the event of asset quality deterioration on the back of HNBs rapid loan growth, the rating agency added.

Chinas overdue credit card payments rise 5 pct in Q2
	
Chinas overdue credit card payments rose 4.91 percent in the second quarter from the quarter before, the countrys central bank said yesterday in a report posted on its official website. As the speed of growth in the country slows, borrowers have been finding it harder to repay debt, leading to an increase in soured loans.

Such overdue payments made up 1.43 percent of the total amount outstanding on credit cards.

Dutch finance minister seeks 20% cap on all corporate bonuses
	
AFP - Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem yesterday called for bonuses for company bosses to be capped at 20 percent of annual pay, saying huge payouts were out of balance with other staff.
Writing in the centre-left De Volkskrant daily, Dijsselbloem argued that while the Dutch economy was doing better most peoples purchasing power was still recovering after the economic downturn.
But the rewards at the top are already way out of the starting blocks, he wrote.
Under Dutch law enacted in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, the top bosses of Dutch state-owned companies cannot receive bonuses higher than a fifth of their annual pay.
But the executives of companies like Ahold, Heineken and Unilever can earn over a hundred times more than the average worker in their company, Dijsselbloem complained.
Relations within companies are put off balance by this disparity, he warned.
And in years when everyones income is under pressure, such developments at these are not justified.
The issue of huge golden handshakes and massive payouts for corporate bosses has fuelled anger in many European countries.
And bankers bonuses were widely blamed for encouraging the risk-taking culture that ultimately left banks over-stretched and in need of massive government bailouts costing billions.
Dijsselbloem, who is also heads the 19-country eurozone group, said there was huge dissatisfaction with the gap between the elite and ordinary citizens.
Company directors and auditors need to be aware of the discontent, he warned and find ways to manage it, including by being transparent about wages.

Finance ministry officials blocking 90% tax on Tobacco, Cigerettes
	
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said today certain officials in the Finance Ministry were sabotaging the governments effort to control the use of tobacco and cigarettes by scuttling the cabinet proposal to increase tobacco tax to 90%.
A joint proposal was made to the Cabinet by President Maithripala Sirisena and me to increase the tax on tobacco to 90% with the Finance Ministry wanting to study the proposal and submit its observations. Whenever this matter was discussed the officials raised several concerns saying the tax increase will affect the industry and its 300,000 employees. I am sad to say that these officials spoke like agents of the cigarette company with no concern about the huge cost which as to be borne by the Health Ministry to treat the thousands of patients suffering from tobacco-related diseases such as lung cancer and respiratory complications. I must tell that the government's aim is to weaken the tobacco industry and prevent people from smoking and we can save billions of rupees if that happens, the minister said. "Finance Ministry officials even attempted to teach us about the data on smoking and related diseases and said the tax increase will be a loss to the Treasury and not an increase on income."
He said despite the many obstacles he was determined to the 90% tax levy sooner than later and a three-member ministerial committee has been appointed to report to the Cabinet before its next meeting.
The minister said he was confident of Cabinet approving the tax increase at its next meeting and pointed out that he was determined to reduce the prices of medicinal drug prices through the National Medicinal Drugs Regulatory Authority (NMRA).
The NMRA has to carry out a meticulous survey on current prices of drugs and the 500% profit made by drug companies, importers and distributors. It is a mammoth task to regulate and price some 10,000 drug varieties imported to Sri Lanka. My target is to limit the profit to about 80%, he said.
The minister said the World Health Organization had commended Sri Lanka on its national immunization programme and the eradication of Malaria, Filaria and polio.
The WHO categorizes Sri Lanka among the ten best countries in the world on the control, treatment and prevention of many a disease and on its free health policy. We are on the verge of eradicating tetanus, hepatitis and measles. Diseases like rabies are under control and our National Immunization Programme in one of the best in the world. Our health service is the best in the region and lowest in child mortality rate, maternal deaths and premature births, he said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Monitoring mechanism to prevent abuse of news
	
Deputy Mass Media and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Karunaratne Paranawithana said yesterday that the government would set up a Monitoring Mechanism for news broadcast and publications in the print and electronic media under the proposed Press Commission to prevent the abuse of news in print and electronic media.
He added that the new measure would not anyway attempt to control or dictate to media personnel or media establishments on the media but to arrest the current degeneration of news broadcast and publication in the newspapers, radio, TV and websites.
The Monitoring Mechanism will be set up after consulting all stakeholders in the media such as journalists, media institutions, the academia, the public at large and the readers, listeners and TV watchers in particular and added it will not thrust upon the media by force.
There is no argument that the media - print and electronic  has come down to its lowest ebb in quality, news value and usage. What we want is to arrest this sad situation. There are instances on daily basis news in both medium being used for mud slinging, character assassinations. In addition, publication in the print media and airing in TV and radio of lies, absolute lies, fabrications, distortions, misinterpretations and canard are not rare. The Press Complaints Commission and Press Council are toothless and have no influence at all on erroneous and unethical acts by media institutions or journalists. Therefore, it is our duty to put a stop to this sorry state of affairs in the media before long, Deputy Minister Paranawithana stressed.
Deputy Minister Paranawithana said there was no way at the moment to amply compensate or erase the damage caused to a citizen by character assassinations in the media except by legal action that takes years to conclude and costs a huge amount of money.
He added that by introducing the Right to Information (RTI) Act, the government gave the media unrestricted freedom and opportunity to access any government institution for information. If the media is to get the full benefits of the RTI, journalists must act as fully qualified and highly educated professionals. There is no space for gutter journalism in this set up. What we want is to put an end to gutter journalism and create a media that upholds ethical, social and family values and respect the rule of law and democracy. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

New premises for Foreign Affairs Ministry
	
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be relocated in a modern building in a plot of land about two acres in extent at Jawatta Road, Colombo.
The memo submitted to relocate the Foreign Affairs Ministry from the current location by Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera was approved by the cabinet on Tuesday, Cabinet spokesman, Mass Media and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Gayantha Karunatilaka said.
Minister Samaraweera told the cabinet in his memo that the Republic Building, which the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently situated was built during the British colonial era and has been identified as heritage that should be conserved and hence the relocation.
Due to the insufficient office space, extensive repairs and maintenance of the Republic Building, several efforts were taken since 2011 to relocate the Ministry in a suitable place. However, all such efforts taken so far have not been successful due to numerous reasons and it has now been essential to find a suitable place to relocate the Ministry. It may also be necessitated to relocate the Ministry in accordance with the future plans of relocating all the government buildings outside the Colombo city limit.
The Cabinet in 2011 allocated 3.5 acres of land within the Waters Edge premises at Battaramulla owned by the UDA for the relocation of the MOFA. Accordingly, a land in extent of 2 acres has been identified by the UDA within the Waters Edge premises due to the limited extent of land at the above location.
As the said 2 acres of land was not suitable for the relocation of the MOFA, another UDA land closer to the Jana-kala Kendraya premises was identified. Subsequently, the UDA has decided to allocate the same land in extent of 9 acres 2 rood 19 perch to the MOFA, he said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Northern resettlement to finish by next year
	
Resettlement of over 3,000 people displaced in the northern Jaffna will be completed by mid next year, an official has said, days after UN chief Ban Ki-Moon called for expediting reconciliation efforts with the minority Tamils.
Jaffnas security forces commander Mahesh Senanayake said a little over 3,000 people are remaining to be resettled.
There are 3,388 people from 971 families living in 71 displaced camps in Jaffna. All of them will be resettled in their places of origin by June next year, he said at a new housing settlement built in Keeramalai in Jaffna on Wednesday.
He said 88 per cent of the heavily booby-trapped lands in Jaffna have been cleared of anti-personnel mines. The de-mining work in the areas will take a lot more time. This is no easy job to clear all areas of mines.
Some 300,000 people were displaced during the last phase of the war with the LTTE in 2009. They were housed in relief camps in the northern town of Vavuniya. Following a concerted international effort to grant relief to them, the governments resettlement campaign became a success. Officials said the remaining people to be resettled are those who are mostly from areas heavily booby-trapped during the war by both the LTTE and the army.
After the war ended, the government had come under increasing international pressure to resettle the displaced and release the lands held for military purposes.
There has been phased out release of civilian lands which was stepped up since January last year. UN Secretary General Ban, during his visit to Sri Lanka, highlighted the importance of addressing the question of the war displaced and other outstanding issues in the former battle zones.

REUTERS: The Sri Lankan rupee ended firmer yesterday as late inward remittances ahead of the annual Haj pilgrimage surpassed the mild dollar demand from importers, dealers said.
The spot rupee ended at 145.00/15 per dollar, compared with Wednesdays close of 145.40/45. One-week forwards were quoting at 145.15/30, compared with previous days close of 145.65/70, but were not traded as the spot was actively traded.
The spot rupee is usually managed by the Central Bank, and market participants use the forward market levels for guidance on the currency.
There were inward remittances in the latter part of the day ahead of the festival, a currency dealer said, asking not to be named.
Muslims in Sri Lanka will celebrate Eid al-Adha on Monday.
Dealers said seasonal importer demand would pick up from mid-October. Central Bank Governor Indrajith Coomaraswamy said last week that the currency was not under upward pressure as capital inflows had not been of sufficient magnitude to exert such pressure.

The 6-month yield fell 23 basis points to 9.94 percent, and the 3-month yield fell 28 basis points to 8.75 percent.
The debt office offered to roll over Rs11 billion of bills and bought only exactly Rs11 billion, made up of Rs1.0 billion of 3-month, Rs2.0 billion of 6-month and Rs8.0 billion of 12-month bills.
In bond markets, yields have also fallen several basis points over the week, dealers said.
In money markets, a liquidity shortage has ended with the Central Bank buying dollars to create rupees and the market becoming excess from August 29.
The Central Bank, however, did not mop the liquidity by outright sales of Treasury bills and stopped collecting forex reserves from that day.
Unless liquidity is mopped up, banks will loan the liquidity again and imports will be generated, and the Central Bank will have to sell the reserves it collected to maintain the peg.
Excess liquidity, which is up as much at Rs20 billion on 31 August, has since fallen again.

Sri Lankan refugees in HK sheltered Snowden
	
A group of Sri Lankan and Filipino refugees in Hong Kong had sheltered US whistleblower Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor, until he fled to Russia from Hong Kong, the New York Times reported on Wednesday.
The news article said at least four residents of Hong Kong had taken Mr. Snowden in when he fled the US in June 2013.
Only now have they decided to speak about the experience, revealing a new chapter in the odyssey that riveted the world after Mr. Snowden disclosed that the N.S.A. had been monitoring the calls, emails and web activity of millions of Americans and others.
At the time, governments and news outlets were scrambling to find the source of the leaks, which were published in The Guardian and The Washington Post. In an interview recorded in a hotel room, Mr. Snowden identified himself and revealed that he was in Hong Kong. Then he went into hiding. About two weeks later he turned up in Moscow.
It was never clear where Mr. Snowden was holed up during those critical days after leaving his room at the five-star Mira Hotel, when the US was demanding his return. As it turns out, he was staying with one Vanessa Mae Bondalian Rodel and her daughter who are from Philippines.
They were also seeking political asylum in Hong Kong and live in cramped, substandard apartment blocks in some of the citys poorest districts.
They were all clients of one of Mr. Snowdens Hong Kong lawyers, Robert Tibbo, who arranged for him to stay with them.

After a few days with Ms. Rodel and her daughter, Mr. Snowden spent a night with Ajith Pushpakumara, 44, who said he fled to Hong Kong after being chained to a wall and tortured for deserting the army in his native Sri Lanka.
Mr. Pushpakumara said he had listened to online radio broadcasts about Mr. Snowden and was surprised to suddenly find him in the dingy apartment that he shared with several men. He realized Mr. Snowden was in the same situation he was, hiding in a small room. I was worried about him, he said.
Supun Thilina Kellapatha, his wife and their toddler also sheltered Mr. Snowden, putting him up for about three days in their 250-square-foot apartment.
Mr. Kellapatha, 32, who said he sought protection in Hong Kong after being tortured in Sri Lanka, described their guest as a tired man who was unfailingly polite.
He said, You are a good man,  when he arrived at the apartment, Mr. Kellapatha recalled. But I feel he is better than me, because he respected me.
Mr. Kellapatha and his wife, Nadeeka Dilrukshi Nonis, said they were not worried about hosting Mr. Snowden. I dont think I take the risk, he said. He is the one who take the big risk.
When Mr. Snowden left, he left the couple $200 under a pillow, which they said they used to buy necessities for their daughter. Sometimes I tell Supun, maybe he forgot us, Ms. Nonis said. I want to tell him: Edward, how are you We will never forget you. 
After fleeing Hong Kong, Mr. Snowden was granted asylum in Russia. He has been unable to leave that country because he is wanted on espionage charges in the United States, but he routinely speaks to the press and at international conferences on government surveillance and civil liberties via video conference.

Work to rule at SriLankan: Management not informed
	
Though the pilots of SriLankan Airlines had decided to conduct a work-to-rule campaign with effect from Thursday midnight, sources at SriLankan Airlines said its management had not been informed of the trade union's decision.
The move by pilots belonging to the Airline Pilots Guild of Sri Lanka (ALPGSL) follows a decision by the SriLankan Airlines Flight Operations Management to conduct random breathalyzer tests on pilots.
The management had decided to go in for breathalyzer tests because of an incident in Frankfurt, where a SriLankan Airlines pilot was found to be unfit to operate the aircraft as he was under the influence of alcohol.
Soon after the tests were introduced, a pilot was suspended for refusing to undergo the test, sources said.
However, the Guild had said the particular pilot had not turned down the test but only questioned the procedure of breathalyzer testing.
Attempts to contact the ALPGSL over their not officially informing the SriLankan Airlines management about the TU action were not successful. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
