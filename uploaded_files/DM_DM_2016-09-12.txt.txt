Assault on envoy: Lax security, corruption blamed for poor Malaysian response
	
An appalling lack of security at the Kuala Lumpur Airport (KLIA) and a corrupt Malaysian administration are blamed for the brutal assault on the Sri Lankan High Commissioner in Malaysia, Ibrahim Sahib Ansar, by a group of local Indian Tamil radicals at airport on September 4.
Informed sources had told Indian Express that security at the KLIA is lax that anyone can enter it and go up to the immigration area without any security check of their person and bags. There is no concept of VVIP security to ensure that high risk individuals are protected against demonstrators, thugs or terrorists.
In fact the Sri Lankan envoy was beaten up by intruding thugs in the No Entry (High Security) area.
Envoy Ansar had alerted the police well in advance about a potential threat to Sri Lankan dignitaries in view of former President Mahinda Rajapaksas visit to Kuala Lumpur to attend an international political parties conference. But no special security systems were put in place.
A day before the assault on him at the airport, the Malaysian police had informed the envoy of a plan to throw petrol bombs at his residence. Security at the house was stepped up but only for a day. Subsequent to the attack on him on September 4, no security was given to him despite a specific request put in by the Sri Lankan government.

Hirunika posts a shot in the head photo
	
A photo of the late Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra, which shows a gunshot wound in the head, was posted on Facebook by his daughter UNP MP Hirunika Premachandra yesterday.
The photo has been taken on the day he was killed.
MP Premachandra said her intention of releasing the photo, was not to gain sympathy but to make the public aware of how a 'shot in the head' looked like.
Every time I see this picture I don't think it's real, because I only remember his handsome face with a smile on, she said.
For the first time in my life I am posting this picture. Not for your sympathy, but for you to understand this is how a 'shot in the head' looks like.
Its impossible to live even a second after a shot like this... something to think about, she has said in her Facebook post.
Last week, former MP Duminda Silva and four others were sentenced to death by the Colombo High Court over the 2011 killing of Mr. Premachandra and three others in Mulleriyawa.

More SL women go for beer: President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena today lamented the fact that an increasing number of Sri Lankan women were taking to drinking beer even though it was heartening to see a decline in the smoking habit.
He said the control and prevention of alcoholism and drug abuse was a collective responsibility of all concerned.
The President said every effort should be made to prevent schoolchildren falling victim to narcotics and alcohol because if not it will end up as a national disaster.
He sounded this cautionary note at a ceremony held at the BMICH today to distribute Life time Achievement National Awards of the Mithuru Mithuro, a non profit local NGO dedicated to rehabilitate and socially integrate young drug addicts.
We must ask ourselves whether we have fulfilled our responsibilities to the satisfaction of the family, society and the country If we have done that then drug abuse cannot be a problem. But we all are aware that drug abuse has become a pressing national issue worldwide, the President said. "It is extremely vital for politicians, officials, the business community, clergy, teachers and parents to perform their duty and the nation and only then that we can save the nation and wean away the younger generation in particular from drugs, alcohol and smoking."

MR shouldnt seek office, but support SLFP: Duminda
	
Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) General Secretary Minister Duminda Dissanayake said the SLFP, expects former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, will cooperate with the party rather than seeking office at future elections.
In an interview with the Daily Mirror, the Minister said the party will be reorganised further in the event of its Convention.
We are in the process of reorganising and restructuring the party to propel it to new heights in politics. We do it by appointing new organisers when and where necessary, he said. 
Q: The Convention was boycotted by the SLFP MPs sitting in the Joint Opposition which is the faction loyal to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Is the party contemplating action against them
It is not needed actually. I think the rank and file of the party sent a message to them. If you look at the mammoth crowd at the Convention in Kurunegala, it will be easy to determine whether party people stand. They understand where peoples heart lies. It remains with the party, not with a group. The Joint Opposition members can well learn a lesson from this.
Q: Is a SLFP-led government possible without the support of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who is popular among the rank and file of the party
We hope he will support the formation of a SLFP government. Mr. Rajapaksa cannot contest the next Presidential Election due to constitutional bars for it. Also, he does not stand the chance for becoming the next Prime Minister within the remaining period. He has held all positions starting from the MP post to presidency. He has been the party chairman. He is well aware that he has passed his time now.
Since he knows he cannot take over power again, we believe he will cooperate with the party to gain power. He will use his popularity to ensure victory for the party. That is the only option. If he cannot win, he should work for the partys victory at least. (Kelum Bandara)

New legislation to restructure State Ventures: PM
	
The government will introduce legislation to deal with the process of converting loss making state ventures into viable entities under a new formula, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament last week.
The Prime Minister said a board would be established under the provisions of this legislation to act in this regard, and it would report to Parliament.
In my personal view, if a state venture is riddled with frauds or run at losses, either MPs or any other group should have the right to go to court. In the private sector, when a company is collapsing due to incompetence of administration, provisions are there providing for such action. We dont find such provisions in the government sector. If such provisions were available, these ventures would not be incurring losses, he said.
The Prime Minister said once the draft legislation was ready, Parliament could submit its views in this respect.
He was responding to a question by JVP MP Nalinda Jayastissa. He asked whether the government had planned to privatize state ventures and if so the modalities for it.
Mr. Wickremesinghe replied that state corporations were not profiteering, or otherwise the profit margin was very low.
Then, we are grappling with a debt burden. Administration has collapsed. There are issues in state enterprises. When the 2016 budget was formulating, there were debts which were unaccounted for. Such borrowings not accounted for as part of national debt amounts top Rs.1300 billion, he said. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)

Paranagama Com. recommends Intl technical assistance and observers
	
The Maxwell Paranagama Presidential Commission on Missing Persons has strongly recommended in its final report that in the event of Sri Lanka were to set up a purely domestic tribunal without the participation of any foreign judges, there must be an international technical assistance and observers to ensure the acceptance of the mechanism, the Daily Mirror learns.
The Commission has wound up its activities after the enactment of the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) and handed over its final report to the President last month.
While it is the view of the Paranagama Commission that a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) should be at the heart of a reconciliation process, the Commission recognizes that there may well be cases relating to disappearances or abductions that may amount to a violation of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) or International Human Rights Law (IHRL). In such cases there may well be a need to mark the severity of such in offence or offences by means of a prosecution, the Commission said.
In addition, provision, may be necessary for a criminal trial in a High Court, in the event of failure of those appearing before the TRC to tell the truth.
The recommendation of this Commission in this regard are the same as the recommendation made by this Commission in dealing with the Second Mandate Report where this Commission set out in the clearest possible in a language that the proposed mechanism should be a combination of a domestic TRC and a purely local judicial mechanism to achieve peace and reconciliation, it said.
It is for the political authorities to determine whether a South African-style Peace and Reconciliation Commission under appropriate amnesties for truth telling is the most appropriate mechanism or if the judicial model which combines the prosecution of those who bear the greatest responsibility coupled with a Truth and Reconciliation Commission will better meet Sri Lankas post conflict needs.

Residents of Bamba flats in two minds on re-development
	
An event organized on Sunday by the Bambalapitiya flats Welfare Association to collect signatures from residents for a memorandum to be sent to the President against the Re-development of Bambalapitiya Flats ended inconclusively.
The residents, who refused to sign the document, asked the committee members of Welfare Association how future proceedings will be carried out by the Association to urge the government to stop the proposed re-development plan.
That was when heated arguments took place between the committee members and some of the residents among who had gathered at the Community Center Hall.
Even though the committee members including the Associations president N. Ragunanthan attempted to explain the steps being taken by the Association to prevent project going ahead, about four residents continued to vehemently argue with the committee members.
The residents meanwhile, were unaware that the Cabinet at its meeting on March 2, 2016 had already given its approval to the Housing and Constructions Ministry to go ahead with the re-development project planned for the Bambalapitiya flats under a public-private partnership (PPP) agreement.
DM journo intimidated by some residents
Despite the media being invited to cover the meeting, it was unfortunate that a Daily Mirror female journalist had to undergo an unpleasant experience due to the action of some residents when she attempted to explain the Cabinet decision on the project.
She was intimidated by some of the residents who warned her not to write anything about the incidents that occurred at the meeting.
The journalist, who walked out of the meeting after realizing that it was not the best time to have a discussion with those few seemingly angry residents, but she was again intimidated by three of them, including a middle-aged woman who appeared to be leading the group of disgruntled residents.
She was even asked to erase the recorded copy on her recorder in their presence.
However, Mr. Ragunanthan who invited the media to cover their so-called meeting came to the scene and explained what had transpired to them and requested the journalist including Daily Mirror journalist to attend a separate discussion with the members of the Welfare Association on this contentious matter.
But the journalists left not being too keen to attend any other discussion.
The committee members of the Bambalapitiya Flats Welfare Association had later apologized to the Daily Mirror journalist. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Why is the Govt. silent: PHU
	
The Foreign Affairs Ministry is remaining silent in the wake of the Danish Immigration Department recognizing Tamil Eelam as one of the countries from which foreigners could apply for a visa to enter Denmark, the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) said today.
It said Danish Immigration website shows Tamil Eelam as one of the options to be selected under the category nationality when filling out the application.
PHU General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila said Australia too had included Eelam as a country at a recent e-census carried out by the Australian Census and Statistics Department.
The Sri Lankan Embassy did nothing to convey its opposition to this move. Australian government agreed to remove Eelam from the list because of the objections raised by Sri Lankans living there. Our Foreign Affairs Ministry expressed its objection after the name was removed from the list, he told a news conference today.
The MP said international recognition was important than a piece of land when creating a new independent country. The MP said Palestine and Tibet were recognized by other nations as independent countries as opposed to Taiwan.
He said Tamil separatists formed the Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam (TGTE) after the defeat of the LTTE in 2009.
This is also a country which has no land. The TGTE is considered as the governing body of Tamil Eelam which has spread internationally. It is requesting the governments to recognize it. If Sri Lankan government remains silent, separatists will achieve what the terrorists failed to do, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
