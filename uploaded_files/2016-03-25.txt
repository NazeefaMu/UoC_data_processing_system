CEB assures uninterrupted power supply
	
The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has curtailed hydro power generation at some of the plants because of the the prevailing dry spell but will not lead to constant power cuts, Chairman Anura Wijepala said.
He said consumers need not panic because the CEB was capable of providing an uninterrupted power supply.
Mr. Wijepala said the drought which is wreaking havoc in the country has drastically reduced the water levels in almost all the hydro-power generating reservoirs and that currently only one-fifth of the total demand is generated by these plants as opposed to the 40% to 45% generated under normal conditions.
"Electricity demand in the country is met by nine thermal power stations, 15 large hydro- power stations and 15 wind farms, with a smaller share from small hydro facilities and solar power," Mr. Wijepala said. ?The problem we have been confronted with right now, is that the hydro-power generation has dropped to 22% of the total capacity and the gap has to be filled by Private Power Providers (PPP) which costs the CEB dearly."
The water levels have drastically reduced at reservoirs in Broadland, Canyon, Castlereagh, Laxapana, Norton, Mausakelle and Bowatenna, Deduruoya, Moragahakanda, Kotmale, Polgolla, Rantambe, Randenigala, Upper Kotmale, Victoria and Kukuleganga that come under the Mahaweli Authority, which the CEB utilizes for power generation. In some reservoirs the water level has dropped to more than 40% of the total capacity.
?The Mahaweli Authority gives priority to release water for drinking and agricultural purposes and only then releases water for power generation. For instance, the CEB does not use the Rantembe reservoir for power generation for about two weeks, as the water has to be released for the Yala Season,? Mr. Wijepala said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Finding truth behind war imperative: CBK
	
Discussing the circumstances that led to the violence that took place in the North as well as what took place during the war was essential if we are to move forward with the reconciliation process, Ex-President and National Unity and Reconciliation Office Chairperson Chandrika Kumaratunga said yesterday.
Mrs. Kumaratunga, who was one of those present at the panel discussion organised by the Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA) to mark the International Right to Truth Day which fell yesterday, said finding out the truth about what took place during the war, talking about it and knowing that it is recognised, was the most important factor in coping with the results of such violence.
?The truth is essential for coping with loss and the pain that accompanies such loss. Some political elements try to prevent the people from learning the truth, especially with regard to the Tamil people during the conflict and the end of the war. They try to create division in the society,? she said.
She said all the victims of the violence including the families of missing persons and those who have lost loved ones, not only in the North and East but also in the South including the families of soldiers who were victims of bomb attacks have the right to the truth.
?We have to discuss all of this and accept the right of all these people to know the truth. Discussing the issues is essential to coming to terms with what happened. The new regime has accepted this and has put various mechanisms into places to seek the truth,? Kumaratunga said.
She said that previously the authorities had appointed many commissions without really being convinced about the need for them and added that there was hope for those seeking the truth under the new regime.
?The political will is there now but a lot of work has to be done in the future. The vision and the way forward are clear and have been worked out. The basic spadework has been done. What we need now is for everyone to give us their fullest support to complete this task, which is a messy operation which deals with millions of victims,? she said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Fitch affirms and withdraws HSBC SL at ?AAA?(lka) over commercial reasons
	
Fitch Ratings Lanka has affirmed and simultaneously withdrawn the rating of HSBC Sri Lanka branch?s (HSBCSL) national long-term rating at ?AAA(lka)? with a stable outlook due to commercial reasons.
HSBCSL?s rating is at the highest end of the national rating scale and reflects the credit profile and financial strength of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HKSB; long-term issuer default rating (IDR): AA-/Stable).
The rating is tied to HKSB?s IDR because of HSBCSL?s legal status as a branch of HKSB, making HSBCSL an extension of the same legal entity as HKSB. HKSB?s rating is higher than Sri Lanka?s long-term local- and foreign-currency IDRs of ?B+? with a negative outlook. As a result, HSBCSL?s rating on the national rating scale is mapped to ?AAA(lka)?. Fitch believes support from HKSB would be forthcoming if required, subject to regulatory constraints on remitting money into Sri Lanka.

Govt. has no mandate to sign ECTA -- Ex- FUTA president
	
The former president of the Federation of University Teachers' Associations (FUTA), Dr Nirmal Ranjith Devasiri said yesterday that the government had no mandate to sign any trade agreement such as the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ECTA), and that its keenness to sign the agreement over the objections of the professionals was a dubious act.
Dr. Devasiri said so at a rally organised by the United Professionals? Movement, and held at Hyde Park, in opposition to ECTA.
?The government is keen to sign ECTA despite the continued objections of the professionals. This itself raises doubts even before we consider the content of the agreement,? he said.
The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) president Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya said the government was attempting to expand the Indo-Lanka trade agreement, which was restricted to goods, but which had been disadvantageous to the service sector as well.
He said the government was going against democratic principles and disregarding their just criticism of ECTA.
He said the GMOA had proposed five principles that should be adhered to when signing such an agreement. These included establishing a national policy, qualifying and quantifying the expected outcome and establishing a methodology for the security of the sectors exposed to the trade.
He said the government should study the terms of an agreement thoroughly before signing it. He said New Zealand had studied an international trade agreement for seven and half years before signing it. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Parliament to meet as Constitutional Assembly on April 5
	
Parliament will meet on April 5 for the first time as the Constitutional Assembly to appoint committees to work on the Constitution-making process, House Leader Lakshman Kiriella said today.
The Constitutional Assembly is a committee of the entire House mandated to draft a new Constitution. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya is its chairman by virtue of his office.
Mr. Kiriella said the Constitutional Assembly would appoint various sub-committees and the Steering Committee on April 5.
?Its proceedings will be opened to the media. There is nothing to hide. People can know what we are doing to ensure transparency. If we have closed door sessions, the opposition members may say something inside and another thing outside to embarrass the Government. It happened regarding the proposal to increase allowances of the MPs. Some party leaders agreed to it at the meeting, but were critical of it outside. We want to avoid that scenario regarding the constitution-making process,? he said.
After initial work, the evolution of the Constitution will begin in May. In April, the House will only meet during its first week. Already, the Committee on Constitutional Reforms has completed deliberations with the people.
The committee, headed by senior lawyer Lal Wijenayake, is presently discussing with the political parties and organizations to obtain their views on the constitutional changes.
Mr. Wijenayake said his committee would submit its report in April for consideration by the Constitutional Assembly. (Kelum Bandara)

UN backs genuine consultations with victims in SL: Moon
	
The UN has advocated for genuine consultations with victims and affected groups, especially women and children, who are far too often excluded and marginalized in countries like Sri Lanka, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon said.
?From Colombia to Tunisia, from Mali to Sri Lanka, from Nepal to South Sudan, the UN has advocated for inclusive and genuine consultations with victims and affected groups, especially women, girls and those who are far too often excluded and marginalized. Their meaningful participation must be ensured in all relevant stages of transitional justice processes and their specific needs must be fully recognized in any reparation measures,? he said observing the International Day for right to truth, which fell yesterday.
To advance this effort, he said the UN supports fact-finding missions, commissions of inquiry, mapping exercises and truth commissions, which document human rights violations and make recommendations to ensure accountability, reconciliation and other reforms.
?Across the world, every victim has the right to know the truth about violations that affected her or him. But the truth also has to be told for the benefit of all people and communities as a vital safeguard against the recurrence of violations. The right to the truth is closely linked to the right to justice,? Mr. Ban said in a message on the Day.
He also stressed the need to secure the testimonies of victims and witnesses to ensure the rights to know the truth and to justice. Appropriate mechanisms for the protection of victims and witnesses, including their physical and psychological integrity, privacy, and dignity, must be put in place.
Moreover, the preservation of archives and other documentation relating to human rights violations is crucial for ensuring undistorted historical record and preservation of memory, he added.
He urged States to adopt measures to promote truth, justice and reparations for victims, which is so crucial to ensuring that gross human rights violations are not repeated.

USS blue ridge to visit SL on March 26
	
The U.S. 7th Fleet flagship USS Blue Ridge (LCC 19) will arrive in Colombo for a port call March 26, the first visit by a U.S. Navy ship since October 2011.?
The visit builds upon last month?s Partnership Dialogue in Washington D.C., where both nations pledged to strengthen maritime security cooperation efforts in the Indian Ocean Region in order to counter piracy, provide humanitarian assistance, and ensure free and safe navigation in the region?s vital shipping lanes.
?A strong relationship between United States and Sri Lanka will help foster greater stability, security, prosperity, and a rules-based order for the Indo-Pacific region and around the world,? said U.S. Ambassador Atul Keshap.? ?This U.S. Navy ship visit demonstrates the U.S. commitment to partners such as Sri Lanka.?
The USS Blue Ridge team consists of more than 900 sailors, who will interact with their Sri Lanka Navy counterparts, experience Sri Lanka?s vibrant culture, and engage with its people.? The sailors will also use their shore leave to volunteer at a community center by refurbishing its walls and furniture, building playground equipment, and serving food to the needy. ?
Members of the U.S. Navy?s 7th Fleet Band will arrive with the ship and stage free public performances in Colombo, including a joint performance with the Sri Lanka Navy, Army, and Air Force bands on March 26 at Viharamahadevi Amphitheatre from 6 to 8 pm.? On March 27 free solo public performances are scheduled at Majestic City at 12 noon and at the Dutch Hospital complex from 6 to 7 pm.? On March 29, they will also perform for students from several area schools at Ananda College.
The USS Blue Ridge has been forward deployed to Yokosuka, Japan for 36 years.? As the command and control flagship for the U.S. 7th Fleet Commander, Vice Admiral Joseph Aucoin, the USS Blue Ridge is committed to strengthening and fostering relationships within the Indo-Asia Pacific region.
The last U.S. Navy ship to visit to Sri Lanka was the USS Ford (FFG 54), which conducted a port call in Galle October 11-14, 2011. (usembassy)
