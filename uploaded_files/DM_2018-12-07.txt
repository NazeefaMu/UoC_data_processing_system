A Kekille judgment to favour a friend!
	

A female white collar one who was functioning as the provincial education head was recently transferred out, holding her accountable for a minor offence committed by one of her subordinates.

Reports say that there is a move afoot now to appoint a close relative of a very high political authority to fill this vacancy which had been deliberately created to accommodate the latter.
The white-collar one, described as a charming lady, about to be appointed to fill the vacancy does not possess the necessary qualifications and she is among the so-called political victims, who had recently been given compensatory promotions to the administrative service.

A rise of incidence in Sri Lanka
	
                   Teenage Pregnancies                 

Theoretically, a girl reaching her menarche (attainment) gives a green light for her to keep one step ahead in the journey of life with the capability to give birth to offspring. Sri Lankan girls usually attain menarche around the age of 12. Does this really mean that they are fully grown up and meet the ultimate physical and psychological requirements to reach this important milestone of life-motherhood
On todays Health Capsule, we are going to shed light on Teenage pregnancy. This is one of the most important issues we get to see in our Gyaenocology and Obstetric wards, probably due to lack of awareness superimposed by amateurish practices and unacceptable social norms.
According to Dr. Suranga Hettipathirana, Consultant Gyaecologist and Obstetrician at Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH), teenage pregnancy is a global phenomenon and is described as a pregnancy occurring in a young woman who has not reached her 20th birthday. This definition, more importantly is applicable irrespective of the legal status of the marriage of the woman or legal age to consider an individual as an adult (A couple whose marriage is registered by the Registrar of marriage is considered as a legal marriage).
The pregnancy rate among teenagers in USA was 67.8 pregnancies per 1,000 women aged 1519 in 2008 and among the countries in the Western Europe, the United Kingdom (UK) has the highest teenage conception and abortion rates. The rate of conception rate among those under 18 years in the UK was 40.5 per 1000 in 2008. This is five times higher than the rate in Netherlands, more than twice the rate in Germany and twice the rate in France. As far as South Asian countries are concerned, Bangladesh, Nepal and India own a teenage pregnancy rate of 35%, 21% and 21%, respectively. However, the teenage pregnancy rate in Sri Lanka is much lower than the rates noted in the rest of South Asian countries. Reproductive health information database of Family Health Bureau of the Ministry of Health, Sri Lanka, indicates that 6.5% of the total pregnancies registered during the year 2010 were teenage pregnancies and in addition to that the Demographic and Health Survey, Sri Lanka, 2006/07 revealed that 6.4% of women had begun childbearing when theywere teens.

A full -term pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks and a baby that is delivered before 37 weeks is a premature baby (preemie)

Also facts reveal that the prevalence is significantly higher in rural areas, estate sectors of Sri Lanka and areas affected by the war that concluded. According to the UNFPA fact sheet ensuring Womens Health, the highest incidence of teenage pregnancy has been recorded in Trincomalee, Batticaloa and Mullativu districts and lowest rates in Matale and Colombo.
Although, there arent any recent studies done, pertaining to this topic, the rate has definitely risen as a result of various socio-economic factors including-low socio-economic status, low educational background, disrupted family structure, having older sexually active siblings or pregnant/parenting teenage sisters, a victim of sexual abuse, poor sexual health practices and lack of knowledge about contraception (birth control), poor parent/child closeness and poor parental supervision or regulation of childrens activities, bringing about a range of lamentable aftermaths Dr Hettipatirana highlights.
According to him, this is more of a vicious cycle where children of those affected teenage mothers have a higher tendency to maintain the same life patterns, normalising unacceptable social practices, ending up becoming teenage mothers.

Are you pregnant
Missing one or more menstrual periods with bodily changes is the classic sign of pregnancy. But this can be quite tricky for teenage girls, whose periods arent yet regular. It can also be vague for girls whose cycles are off due to uncurbed dieting and exercise, low body fat from sports or anorexia.
It is like a baby giving birth to another baby because during the teenage life, neither your body nor your mind is completely ready to accept the poundage of carrying another life inside you saysDr. Hettipathirana.
In fact, this can create much trouble not only to the teenage mother, but also for the baby he added.
Sequels on health cannot be brushed aside
nHigh blood pressure-Pregnant teens have a higher risk of getting high blood pressure -- called pregnancy-induced hypertension compared those in their 20s or 30s. They also have a higher risk of preeclampsia which is a dangerous medical condition that combines high blood pressure with excess protein in the urine, swelling of a mothers hands and face and organ damage.
nSexually transmitted diseases-Teens who have unsafe sexual intercourse during pregnancy, are vulnerable to get STDs such as chlamydia and HIV which can potentially infect the uterus and growing baby.

Iron deficiency anaemia and other vitamin deficiencies
	Urinary tract infections
	Pre-mature delivery-
A full-term pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks and a baby that is delivered before 37 weeks is a premature baby (preemie). These babies are vulnerable to have various complications such as poor lung maturity, intra-ventricular haemorrhage (bleeding in the brain), poor breathing and heart functioning (PDA), inability to maintain body heat, immature gastrointestinal system, retinopathy of prematurity (potentially blinding eye disorder), Necrotizing enterocolitis (poor blood supply to bowel resulting in the infection of bowel wall), sepsis (infection in the blood stream) and many more which can even be fatal.

Prolonged labour
	Obstructed Labour
	Low birth weight babies
Effects on mental health
Antepartum and post-partum depression
	Addiction to smoking, alcoholand drugs
	Neglecting the baby
Once the baby is born, these under-age mothers might not be willing to cater to their child with the due attention, needed. This can often lead to anxiety and annoyance, possibly with the inability to support the healthy growth of a baby.

Financial burden and single parenthood
The burden doesnt stop here! Once the baby is born, his growth and development can further get affected over a period of time which can possibly result in delayed intellectual and motor development with or without behavioural issues. Therefore ongoing medical care and follow-up is crucial to prevent these complications not only to facilitate a normal pregnancy but also to maintain the mothers well-being. This is where the role of MOH becomes important and rather than isolating the affected mothers- traumatising them more with the social blame-games and criticism, a satisfactory quality of life should be ensured thus encouraging and spreading awareness among the society to get away from
similar circumstances.
As medical professionals, things we can do are very limited and it is the responsibility of the entire society to be open on this issue and spread awareness, without considering it as amere anathema
On a concluding thought, Dr. Hettipathirana underscored the importance of having open conversations about the sexual aspect of life, contraception and safe sexual practices in the family setting, strengthening and expansion of social support services, educational programmes at school-targeting early adolescents in order to empower self-integrity in making wise decisions and the augmentation of advocacy to ensure increased awareness and sensibility among girls, their families and communities on the negative consequences of teenage pregnancy not only on sexual and reproductive health but also the overall quality of life of the girl herself, baby and the entire family.

Astrology and Rebirth Natal Chart, key to unlock our past births
	

It is no secret that almost all believers in the Law of Karma and rebirth are curious to know what they were in their previous births, particularly in their immediately previous lifetime.
With the concept of rebirth gaining ground across the world, many scholars, those in the West in particular had begun research into the fascinating phenomenon of rebirth and reams have already been written on their findings.

Past Life regression techniques
Meanwhile, some scholars have taken the initiative to develop techniques for accessing the past life. All these techniques are based on the presumption that ones subconscious mind is the storehouse of all information about ones past births. And some individuals have developed the skill to access persons past lifetimes by sending him into a trance through hypnosis or meditation. This technique is referred to as the Past Life
Regression (PLR). This is a technique that enables you to extend your memory lane to lifetimes beyond your current life.

Psychiatric treatment therapy
In fact, this PLR technique is being widely used across the world as a form of therapy to heal the psychiatric ailments of patients. Life Research Academy in Hyderabad in India is a well- known place where psychiatric patients are treated using the Past Life Regression therapy.

Natal Chart, the Key to unlock ourpaST births
What we have already said is only incidental to our main subject, Astrology and Rebirth. In fact, rebirth is the quintessence of Astrology, whether it belongs to the Western, Chinese or the Vedic school. Both Western and Vedic astrologers accept that the ones Natal Chart provides the clue to what one had been in his previous lifetime.

Teachings of Vedic Astrology and Western Astrology
Vedic Astrology teaches that the 9th House and the ruler of the decanate (Drekanna) occupied by the Sun or the Moon (whichever is stronger) placed in the Natal Chart provides the key to unlock ones past birth. Meanwhile the Western Astrology says that North Node and the South node of the Moon  Rahu and Ketu in a Natal Chart provide the key to access ones past life.
Western astrologers maintain that the lunar nodes representing the points where Moons orbit crosses the ecliptic the apparent path of the Sun moving around the earth  (it is really the earth that moves around the Sun. However, from our vantage positions we see as the Sun moving round the earth)  hold the clue to unraveling the mystery of our previous births. They say that the South Node represents the karmic path in our current lifetime and the North Node unfolds challenges and fortunes we have brought forward to the current lifetime from our previous births.

China demands clarity over arrest of Huawei CFO
	

Beijing on Thursday demanded the US and Canada clarify why Ottawa has detained Chinese telecom equipment giant Huaweis Chief Financial Officer Sabrina Meng Wanzhou at the request of the US Government.
Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Geng Shuang said that both the US and Canadian authorities had yet to clarify their reason for arresting Meng, who is also one of Huaweis deputy chairpersons and a daughter of its founder and Chief Executive Ren Zhengfei.
Geng said Beijing had lodged protests with Washington and Ottawa and offered consular assistance to Meng soon after she was detained.
Her arrest in Vancouver raises more doubts about a 90-day truce on trade struck between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping on December 1, the day she was detained. Wanzhou Meng was arrested in Vancouver on December 1, Ian McLeod, a Canadian Justice Department spokesman, said. She is sought for extradition by the United States, and a bail hearing has been set for Friday.
As there is a publication ban in effect, we cannot provide any further detail at this time. The ban was sought by Ms Meng, McLeod said.
She was arrested because she attempted to evade the trade embargo placed by the US on Iran, The Globe and Mail reported, citing a Canadian source with knowledge of the arrest. No other details were available.
The Chinese side has lodged stern representations with the US and Canadian sides, urged them to immediately correct the wrongdoing and restore the personal liberty of Ms Meng Wanzhou.

## Title: CKDu The silent grim reaper

CKDu The silent grim reaper
	

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is defined as the gradual impairment of kidney functions over a period of time due to a certain disease or condition. The predominant causes of CKD globally are diabetes (high blood sugar) and hypertension (high blood pressure) especially in developed countries. However, for more than two decades now a new form of CKD has emerged, wreaking havoc in certain low- and middle-income countries across the globe. This affliction, now known as Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown origin (CKDu) has been commonly seen to be prevalent in areas of Central America, the North-Central Province of Sri Lanka, the state of Andhra Pradhesh of India and possibly in Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco and Saudi Arabia. The emergence of CKDu poses a far greater threat to the Sri Lankan health sector as no proper identifiable cause has been implicated so far. Following are some frequent question asked about CKDu and these my answersfor them.
Q What are the functions of the human kidney
The human kidneys are a pair of bean shaped organs located on either side of the spine, below the rib cage within the abdominal cavity. The length of a healthy kidney varies from 10-14cm with a width of roughly 3-4cm and typically the right kidney is located slightly lower to that of the left. The kidneys are essentially the filtration unit of the human body and each kidney comprises a million tiny filters called nephrons which form its functional unit. The following are some of the main functions this important organ carries out,

Excretion of metabolicwaste products
	Regulation of blood pressure and maintenance of overall fluid balance
	Management of electrolyte levels (Sodium, Potassium, Bicarbonate etc.) and preserving theacid-base equilibrium
	Production of hormones that induce creation of red blood cells (Erythropoietin), control blood pressure (Renin) and facilitate the promotion of bonehealth (Calcitriol)
Q What is CKDu
CKDu is defined as a form of chronic tubule-interstitial disease that involves progressive kidney damage in the absence of recognizable causes of renal disease such as diabetes mellitus, chronic or severe hypertension, snake bite, glomerulonephritis (acute inflammation of kidneys) or urological diseases (kidney stones, urinary tract infections etc.) in conjunction with a normal glycated hemoglobin level (HbA1C) and an untreated blood pressure value of < 160/90 or a blood pressure value of <140/90 controlled by up to two antihypertensive medications. The disease is classified into four stages based on proteinuria and cut-off values of the estimated glomerular filtration rateor eGFR.

No specific guidelines or recommendations exist currently for treatment. Control of hypertension and prevention of further exposure to toxins is the best course of action
Q Is there a correlation between Agrochemical usage and CKDu
The late 1950s experienced a paradigm shift on a global level with the advent of the Green Revolution. Funded heavily by the Rockefeller Foundation and Ford Foundation this movement promoted a heavy reliance on chemical fertilizer, synthetic herbicides, pesticides and select high-yield crop varieties (cereals, dwarf wheats and rice etc.) to increase the overall agricultural output. In 1960, following the establishment of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in Philippines these revolutionary methodologies were introduced to India-which was on the brink of a mass famine- where astounding results were reaped. As a result, our island nation too embraced this agricultural phenomenon. Agrochemical usage further increased in Sri Lanka with the introduction of the Open Economy and trade liberalization policies of 1977.
During the early 1990s several cases of CKD followed by deaths were reported in the remote farming community of Padaviya in the Anuradhapura district. As time progressed similar cases cropped up from nearby regions such as Medawachchiya and Medirigiriya in the Polonnaruwa district, Girandurukotte and Mahiyanganaya in the Uva province and Dehiaththakandiya located in the Eastern province. A community based cross-sectional study conducted in 2010 across five provinces displayed that previously established etiologies of CKD were not seen in 84%, 81% and 72% of patients of the North-Central, Uva and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka respectively, which were the three provinces most severely affected by CKDu. Analyzing the data aggregated, it could be ascertained that this affliction was predominantly seen in males (Age 40-60) who live in rural agricultural farming communities. Recent efforts of leading academics thus far, have concluded that CKDu is a multi-factorial environmentally acquired disease and that Glyphosate (a broad-spectrum systemic herbicide and crop desiccant) maybe a major contributory cause.

People living in endemic areas must be subject to regular screening tests so as to detect CKDu early on.
Q What are the symptomsof CKDu
Nearly 80% of CKDu sufferers die within 2 years of diagnosis. This is because they only display symptoms when they have reached the End stage renal failure phase. Occasionally patients exhibit non-specific symptoms such as painful urination (dysuria), lower abdomen or flank pain and a generalized feeling of being unwell. More suggestive symptoms are,

Nausea and Vomiting
	Loss of weight and Loss of appetite
	Accumulation of fluid in the abdomen (ascites), swollen ankles, feet and legs(edema)
	Generalized body itching
	Decreased urine output
	Easy fatiguability and difficulty in breathing
	Sleep disturbance
	Anemia
Q How do we diagnose CKDu
People living in endemic areas must be subject to regular screening tests so as to detect CKDu early on. At present eGFR and urinary albumincreatinine ratio is used for screening. An Ultrasound scan of the abdomen to assess the kidneys is also an important diagnostic method. Apart from the afore mentioned, the following urine and blood tests would also reveal important data,

Urine tests  Urine Full Report (UFR), Urine albumin
	Blood tests  Serum Electrolytes, Creatinine clearance, Serum creatinine, Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) Full Blood count (FBC), Serumtotal protein
Q What is the treatment and prevention of CKDu
No specific guidelines or recommendations exist currently for treatment. Control of hypertension and prevention of further exposure to toxins is the best course of action. General treatment strategies of CKD-such as control of anaemia, decrease intake of high protein diets, haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and Kidney transplantation- are meanwhile used in most settings.
Drinking from good water sources, adequate occupational safety precautions, lifestyle modifications (reduce smoking, minimize alcohol consumption) and good drug compliance are some of the best ways to prevent CKDu.

Coping with Bipolar Disorder
	

Have you ever come across someone; perhaps a child or an adult who has expressed extreme moods swings that may vary from being either emotionally high or low Have you ever come across the term, Bipolar Disorder or has it ever crossed your mind Todays Health Capsule is dedicated to a topic that sheds more light on a psychiatric disorder that does prevail in society, but often goes unnoticed due to the complicated nature in which this health condition presents itself. Providing more insight into the topic, Dr. Udena Attygalle, Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist at the Teaching Hospital, Karapitiya elucidated the various aspects of Bipolar Disorder while further explaining how the condition could affect an individuals mental and social well being.

What is Bipolar Disorder
Explaining the condition, Dr. Attygalle said that Bipolar Disorder is a psychiatric disorder, that is usually characterised by episodes of both mania and depression. According to him, episodes of mania only are also classified as part of Bipolar Disorder as depressive episodes may occur at a later stage. Although seemingly easy to understand, this is a complicated disorder with many variations.

Symptoms of manic and depressive episodes
An episode of mania is where there are symptoms of elated mood, increased energy levels, grandiosity, lack of need for sleep, being suddenly over talkative as well as not keeping social boundaries as before. On the other hand, an episode of depression is characterised by a low mood, lethargy, feelings of hopelessness, guilt and worthlessness . In some there may be a loss of appetite and sleep as well as suicidal ideation Dr. Attygalle explained. Both types of episodes need to be clinically significant periods with deterioration in function. However, normal periods of mood swings are not considered as a part of Bipolar Disorder.

Patient Diagnosis
Though to diagnose Bipolar Disorder you need distinct episodes of depression and mania, it should also be noted that the affected persons are often well with a normal mood (euthymic mood) in between these episodes. In some cases, there may be long periods of depression that are difficult to identify as an episode, In other instances the condition can present itself with mixed episodes featuring both depression and manic symptoms  he added. Dr. Attygalle further noted that since this is a complicated illness, it is best treated by a psychiatrist with training and experience in the condition.

Differentiating between a child and adult suffering from
Bipolar Disorder, Dr. Attygalle said that adults can present with the typical symptoms as mentioned earlier. He stated that children and adolescents can present with a slightly different picture in comparison to adults. According to him, Paediatric Bipolar Disorder is a rare condition relative to Adult Bipolar Disorder, and has to be differentiated from other conditions in childhood with similar presentations. As such this condition can be easily misdiagnosed and is best diagnosed by a Child andAdolescent Psychiatrist.
Children and adolescents with Bipolar Disorder tend to present with both elation and irritability. They also tend to have more rapid and complex mood cycles. Mixed mood states may be more common in this age group.
Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder is a childhood condition characterized by extreme irritability and frequent temper tantrums. To be diagnosed with this condition, the child must have these symptoms for at least 12 months. This is a similar condition, but different from Paediatric Bipolar Disorder, and is limited to childhood and is a less sever condition.
Among children, around 70% of those with Paediatric Bipolar Disorder also have been identified to have had Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). However, this does not mean that having ADHD is a risk factor for Paediatric Bipolar Disorder he explained.
Adding that the median age of onset for Bipolar Disorder is between 18-25 years, he further noted that during early years, less sever episodes tend to be missed, until they are present again with more severe episodes later in life. When inquired if patients with Bipolar Disorder tend to indicate suicidal or self - harming tendencies, he said that while this may not be the normal case, there can be a high risk for such tendencies especially during periods ofBipolar Depression.

Hereditary 
Affirming that it could also be hereditary, he said that the heritability of Bipolar Disorder has been reported to be as high as 70%. This means that 70% of the variation in a population with regard to the disorder can be attributed to genetic factors as opposed to environmental factors. However according to Dr. Attygalle, this genetic contribution is not straight forward since many genes of small effect are involved and the manifestation of the disorder is dependent on manyother factors.
Treatment avenues and family support
Treatment mainly involves medication. A category of medication described as mood stabilizers are used to reduce episodes of mania and depression and to prevent cycles of low and high moods. However during an episode other medication such as antidepressant and anti-psychotics may need to be used.
Hospitalization may also be required due to aggressive behaviour during manic episodes or suicidal tendencies or when there is a deterioration of function during depression. Family interventions like reducing environmental triggers/stress, early identification of an episode as well a supportive work environment are also useful. Since medication needs to be taken as prophylactic to prevent relapses for long periods of time, the regular monitoring for side effects is also important he said.
When asked how the illness could affect the relationships with family, friends and work colleagues and how people could extend help to an individual suffering with Bipolar Disorder, Dr. Attygalle had the following answer. When the condition occurs in children and adolescents, it can affect the normal development trajectory of the child by affecting their day to day activities. Missing school, not being able to participate in activities with friends can all have an effect on social development as well as on academic attainment. As such minimizing disruptions to their day to day activities is an important part in the management of this condition he concluded.

Empowering women through nutrition
	
The World Food Program addresses hunger and promotes food security 

The United Nations World Food Program (WFP) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNPF) in Sri Lanka launched their new joint project in Colombo on November 26, as the agencies commenced their activities highlighting the Global 16 days of activism against gender based violence campaign 
USD 458,000 ( LKR 81.9 million) has been contributed by the Government of Denmark, to the UN World Food Program for this initiative to empower women through nutrition and to promote gender equality. 
Human rights violations, such as gender based violence, arise due to lack of education, empowerment and adequate nutrition. The project focuses on empowering women entrepreneurs by improving their skills. This will in turn enhance their income, ultimately providing them with nutritional security. 
Six districts including Monaragala, Matale, Mullaitivu,Mannar, Batticaloa and Nuwara Eliya, have been handpicked to implement this project. The areas have been selected based on the vulnerability of the residing communities to climate and nutritional shock.
Sri Lanka is currently number four on the global risk index for climate shock and the communities in the said districts have high indicators for nutritional insecurity. The initiative will be carried out in close cooperation with the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine. 
Lack of adequate exposure and access to sexual and reproductive health is also an underlying cause of gender based violence. Educating women on reproductive health and rights, and paving access to reproductive health services is vital to ensure an end to womenbeing victims. 

"Sri Lanka is currently number four on the global risk index for climate shock"
Women eat last is a way of life in many areas around the globe, especially in Asia. In socio-economically challenged families women have been noted to sacrifice their meals for their male family members, thus compromising their health and nutrional well/being, resulting in a myriad of reproductive health issues and susceptibility to gender based violence. Educating women to be aware of nutritional impact is hoped to instil proper gender balance in households, and is vital to building a healthy community. 
Livelihood programmes designed to help people to be sustainable entrepreneurs have already been planned with the involvement of communities and government officials, and will be implemented in a way that it becomes seed money, and the people would be able to carry it forward.
This project is designed to work in a synergised manner and would be layered on, on other livelihood projects being carried out by the WPF and UNFPA. 
Addressing hunger 
The World Food Program is the food assistance branch of the United Nations and is the worlds largest humanitarian organization addressing hunger and promoting food security. The organization has been operational in Sri Lanka since 1968. 
Fostering social and economic empowerment among Sri Lankas women would help break the vicious intergenerational cycle of malnutrition, said Brenda Barton, The UN WFP Representative. Poor nutrition early in life reduces learning potential, increases reproductive and maternal health risks, and lowers productivity. 
Despite Sri Lankas significant achievements in terms of overall health indicators, one in six children under the age of five is too thin for their height indicating a critical public health situation, while almost one in six newborns has low birth weight.
This indicates a vicious cycle of malnutrition and the need for improved maternal nutrition and nutrion in general. 
Substantial evidence demonstrates that better nourished girls are more likely to remain in school. If young people are also provided with comprehensive knowledge and access to services on sexual and reproductive health, it would unleash the potential of young people to make important contributions to the social and economic development of their communities and the country overall. 
The United Nations Population Fund, formerly known as United Nations Fund for Population Activities, calls for the realization of reproductive rights for all and supports access to a wide range of sexual and reproductive health services including voluntary family planning, maternal health care and comprehensive sexuality education. 

"This project is designed to work in a synergised manner"
Health and well-being 
UNFPA is delighted to start this new collaborative project with WFP, which looks at health and well-being of women and girls in a holistic way. Through this project, we aim to expand choices for women and girls in Sri Lanka, part of the efforts to leave no one behind, said Ritsu Nacken, UNFPA Representative. 
The 16 days of activism campaign begins on November 25 every year, marking the international day for the elimination of violence against women, and concludes on December 10, which is the International Human Rights Day. Despite it being called a 16- day activism campaign, the initiatives and projects launched are actively carried out throughout the year to achieve the set goals. 
The international campaign originated from the first Womens Global Leadership Institute coordinated by the Centre for Womens Global Leadership in 1991. One in three women is a victim of gender based violence, worldwide. Gender based violence abuse has become a pandemic that needs to be addressed and contained, and such projects are a step forward. 
A theme for this campaign is set annually based on the most recent and relevant social issues that need to be addressed. The theme for the year 2018 is Orange the world: End violence against women #HearMeToo. Iconic buildings around the globe will be oranged to attract attention to the cause, to create a future free of gender based violence.

## Title: Lanka on judicial cliffhanger: A lesson from Pakistan

Lanka on judicial cliffhanger: A lesson from Pakistan
	
ri Lankas constitutional coup or crisis, as the case may be, has an eerie similarity to a constitutional coup that took place in Pakistan in 1953  and the evolution of that countrys judiciary  from servility to supremacy  stresses the importance of judicial activism.
The Pakistan coup, that countrys first in a series of coups, teaches us an important lesson: It tells us that generations to come will suffer if any one of the governments arms is to make a mistake, when called upon to play their constitutional role, particularly at a time when the nations existence as a democratic entity is threatened.
Sixty-five years after that constitutional coup and a judicial ruling favouring it, Pakistan is still struggling to establish itself as a fully-fledged democratic state  with the biggest threat to democracy being the military hanging on to that appallingjudicial decision.
If only the Federal Court that was called upon to judge the legalities of the 1953 coup had sided with justice and understood how important democracy was to the nascent state, Pakistan would have been spared of its many military coups that have only contributed negatively to the countrys stability and socio-economic development.
First, the details of the doomful coup which overthrew the government of Prime Minister Khawaja Nazimuddin, a prominent figure in the Pakistan movement: The new nation was struggling to stand on its feet as an independent state. Muhammad Ali Jinnah had died. The country had already faced its first war with India. Its first Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan had been assassinated. The countrys stability was being shaken by never-ending protests and demonstrations. Religious tension was high with Sunni groups urging the government to declare that the Qadianis or the Ahmadis as non-Muslims. Adding to the governments woes were agitations over the Bengali language issue in East Pakistan. Accusing the prime minister of mismanaging the situation, Governor General Ghulam Mohammed dismissed the government in April 1954, although the prime minister had won a confidence vote only a fortnight earlier. Military chief Ayub Khan, who took over the government a few years later as Pakistans first military dictator in the countrys first ever military coup, openly backed the Governor Generals decision.
The coup happened at a time when the country was drafting its first constitution. In the absence of a constitution, governance was subjected to the Government of India Act 1935, a British colonial law which served as an interim constitution.
In September 1954, sensing the danger to democracy, the Constituent Assembly curtailed the Governor Generals power to dissolve the government by amending the Government of India Act 1935. The amendment decreed that the Governor General could do so only with the approval of the Cabinet.
An angry Governor General dissolved the Constituent Assembly itself. The head of the Assembly challenged the dissolution of the Assembly in the Federal Court of Pakistan. In a major blow to the foundation of Pakistans democracy edifice being built, the bench, except for one dissenting opinion, backed the dissolution. The bench, headed by Chief Justice Mohammed Munir built its judgment on the grounds of the doctrine of necessity -- a doctrine that recognises that the well-being of the people is the supreme law. The judgment was also built on the assumption that Pakistan was still a British dominion with the Sovereign being the British Crown and, therefore, not a republic where the supremacy of the Assembly or the sovereignty of the people was upheld. Many analysts say this verdict by a group of conservative judges gave licence for military chiefs to topple democratic governments in Pakistan and interpret their actions in terms of the doctrine of necessity.
In his widely acclaimed book, the Destruction of Pakistans democracy, Allen McGrath notes that Pakistan moved from democracy to military dictatorship, not so much because the military was waiting in the wings to capture power, but because the judiciary gave its stamp of approval for the nations chief executives immoral and democracy-killing move.
He says when Chief Justice Munir denied the existence of the Assemblys sovereignty, he destroyed Pakistans existing constitutional basis.
Seven decades later, Pakistan has evolved from a nation of judicial servility that justified coups to one of judicial proactivism which upholds the democratic spirit of the nation. So much so that the Supreme Court has, in recent years, unseated not one but two prime ministers, in a zealous display of judicial independence. Supporters of the ousted prime ministers, however, decried the judges behaviour as judicial dictatorship.

"The coup happened at a time when the country was drafting its first constitution. In the absence of a constitution, governance was subjected to the Government of India Act 1935, a British colonial law which served as an interim constitution"
Whatever the criticism, Pakistans judiciary has come of age to check the excesses of the executive and it is the only institution the military is scared of. This is more so after the judiciarys courageous stand against the excesses of former military strongman Pervez Musharraf.
In 2012, Pakistans Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, who became internationally known for giving moral leadership to a countrywide movement to topple the Musharraf regime, disqualified Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani after he was found guilty of contempt of court for not carrying out a Supreme Court order.
The court had ordered Gilani to write to the Swiss authorities to reopen fraud investigations against Pakistans then President Asif Ali Zardari. Gilani was summoned to the Supreme Court and told he had been convicted and, therefore, he was disqualified from being a member of Parliament or
prime minister.
In April this year, Pakistans Supreme Court stripped the then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of his premiership saying a person who had been found guilty of corruption was not fit to hold such a high post. The court ruled that anyone disqualified under a constitutional clause requiring legislators to be honest and trustworthy would be considered banned for life. Sharif was hauled before court after the Panama Papers expos by a team of international investigative journalists showed he had secret offshore accounts.
Judicial activism in Pakistan, in recent years, has made the military to think several times before venturing out to stage a coup and capture power. Musharraf is today a fugitive from law. He is facing several cases in the Supreme and High Courts, including one for treason -- for allegedly subverting the constitution.
Judicial activism is part of democracy. At a time when President Maithripala Sirisena has placed Sri Lanka on a cliff, it is only judicial activism that can save the country from doom and save democracy.
The constitution has a body and a spirit. While the body consists of the letters and the wordings, the spirit is found in Article 1 of the Constitution. It says: Sri Lanka is a Free, Sovereign, Independent and Democratic Socialist Republic and shall be known as the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. Every adjective in this Article describes what Sri Lanka is and what it should be. Ours is essentially a democracy and a republic where the supreme power resides in people and elected representatives responsible to them and governing according to law. Therefore, any move to undermine democracy is an attempt to subvert the constitution and its spirit. Protecting democracy is, therefore, not only judicial activism, but also the sacred duty of the judiciary and every citizen of this country.

May holds crisis talks with Cabinet
	

UK, (Daily Mail), 6 December 2018 - Theresa May is holding crisis talks with her inner Cabinet today as she stares down the barrel of catastrophic defeat on her Brexit plan.
The PM summoned senior ministers to Downing Street hours after she vowed to push ahead with the crunch vote.
But several members of the Cabinet are urging her to think again in the face of hardening opposition from Tory rebels and the DUP.
It is understood the meeting is taking stock of the situation on the meaningful vote, with sources playing down the idea that the vote could be put off. 
Earlier, Mrs May struck a defiant tone as she warned there is no other deal on the table, and that killing her proposal off would either end up with the UK crashing out of the EU - or Brexit not happening at all. 
Asked repeatedly about calls from senior ministers to put off the Commons showdown on Tuesday, Mrs May said: We are in the middle of five days of debate in Parliament which will lead up to a vote on this issue.

No personal reason to re-appoint Ranil: Bathiudeen
	
The All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC) yesterday said that they did not have any personal liking for United National Party Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe but they stood with the UNP chiefly to safeguard democracy and to uphold the Constitution that has been violated repeatedly.
Speaking to the media yesterday, Leader of ACMC Rishad Bathiudeen said there was no personal relationship between the ACMC and the UNP but we joined with them as a mark of protest against the blatant violation of the Constitution by the government and the President in particular.
He said all Sri Lankans were bound to act according to the Constitution and no one is allowed to violate it. The removal of Mr. Wickremesinghe from the Prime Minister's post was a clear violation of the Constitution and that was why we have joined to fight against this injustice, the ACMC leader said.
All Sri Lankans are bound to act according to the Constitution and no one can violate it. President Sirisena claimed that even if all 225 MPs accepted want to bring deposed PM Wickremesinghe back he would not allow it. This statement itself is a violation of the Constitution. We oppose all these anti-constitutional acts and statements by President Sirisena, MP Bathiudeen said, adding certain media outlets have been misled into believing that the ACMC was colluding with the UNP to re-appoint Ranil Wickremesinghe as PM which is not true".

Not yet decided on contesting: Dilshan
	
Former Sri Lanka Cricket Captain Tillakaratne Dilshan yesterday said he has not yet made a decision to contest any election though he obtained the membership of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP).
Speaking at a news conference under the banner Voice for Justice, the former skipper explained that the programme was a social welfare programme which helps thousands of poor and homeless people and that was what he was happy to be doing at the moment.
I have not yet made a decision to contest an election because Im so busy with this programme which is a real need at the moment. I did obtain the SLPP membership but it doesnt mean that I will contest. Not everyone who obtains party membership is called upon to contest elections, he said.
However, he said he had always stood by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and would continue to back him because of the role he played in ending the war.
Mr. Rajapaksa ended the war and stood firm in the face of foreign influence. Im someone who knows the impact of war. I first went to a school in Jaffna. My father is a police officer and his life was at risk at least on two separate occasions. Even today, no cricket team goes to Pakistan because of the war. I remember in 1996, some teams refused to visit Sri Lanka. Had the war not been ended, we would still be going through that situation, he said.
Commenting on the current political crisis, Dilshan said the best solution available was to go for a General Election.
There is a conflict between the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary. To resolve this and to prevent the country from heading towards an abyss, the people should be given the opportunity to express their opinion at an election in order to establish a stable government.
Today, I help provide facilities to 5,000 families as a part of my social welfare programme. And under the Dilshan with Youth programme, we distribute sports equipment among national schools. All principals are welcome to contact us so that we could help them. Even after I retired from cricket, I stayed close to the people as they love me and stayed with me through thick and thin. They know I have maintained my credibility. As long as you maintain your credibility, the field you choose doesnt matter, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

O/L candidate, invigilator nabbed with SMS answers
	
An external Ordinary Level examination candidate and an invigilator had been arrested for allegedly using a mobile phone to answer the English question paper in a school in Balangoda, Police said.
They said the candidate had kept his mobile phone and answered the English Language paper yesterday.
The invigilator, who was on duty at another exam centre, had sent the answers to the candidate over the phone, according to the Police.
The candidate was arrested following a complaint to the Balangoda Police by the Balangoda Zonal Education Director.
The suspect was taken to the Balangoda Police and during questioning details of the teacher who sent the answers via SMS was revealed.
The case was reported from the Jeilani Central College, Balangoda.
When contacted the Balangoda Zonal Education Director P.G. Ariyapala said that the hall supervisor had lodged a complaint with him about the incident.
The invigilator claimed that the candidate had come to the examination hall 20 minutes late.
Answering of the English paper started at 8.30 a.m, but the candidate came to the hall at 8.50 a.m.
The invigilator did instruct the candidate to keep irrelevant belongings out of the examination hall.
However despite his instructions using the delay as a pretext the candidate had gone to his table without leaving his belongings outside the hall.
Later, when the examination was in progress, the invigilator had heard the vibration sound of a phone and he informed the hall supervisor.
When the Supervisor had taken the mobile phone, the supervisor had noted that the answers were coming to the phone continuously as SMS messages, he said.
Then he gave the phone again to the candidate and let him write the answers. But he informed the zonal education director and the Department lodged a complaint with the Balangoda Police.
A team of Police officers had gone to the hall and the candidate was taken into custody alone with the phone.
During questioning, the suspect revealed the answers had come from an exam invigilator from another examination hall in Balangoda, Mr Ariyapala said.
The Balangoda Police are conducting investigations.
Mr Ariyapala said relevant action would be taken by the Examinations Department after Police investigations.
The candidate was an Advance Level student, Mr Ariyapala said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

President Maithripala Sirisena today ruled out a snap presidential election despite several parties such as the United National Party (UNP) urging him to so.
He told Daily Mirror that he would not act according to the political agendas of others.
Under the country's Constitution, the President can declare a presidential election at any time after four years if he intended to seek a fresh mandate.
If there is a snap presidential election, only I have to declare it. I have no intention of doing so. I am not ready to comply with the political agendas of others, the President said.
When asked whether he would contest for a second term at the presidential election scheduled for later next year, he said it was too early to decide on it.
There is no need to decide on it now. If you look at the past one month, politics has been riddled with happenings on an hourly basis. As media personnel, you all have so many news stories. That is what happened during the past five weeks. Who could say what will happen in a period of one year from now We cannot say anything now, he said. (Kelum Bandara)

Professionals speak up for democracy
	

The country is at a standstill and it has given an opportunity for people from various walks of life to speak out for their democratic rights. The fight is still on as more groups are flocking together to alert President Sirisena himself about the undemocratic moves he made overnight. From removing the Prime Minister to dissolving the cabinet and proroguing Parliament, policy makers argue how he could resort to such powerful decisions when he himself was instrumental in bringing about the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. In a fruitful discussion organised by Professionals for Democracy, the impact of the present political crisis on various spheres were discussed. These included shedding light on the Constitution, impact on the economy and reconciliation.

This is an issue with the Vinaya Pitaka: Wickremesinghe
"We hoped for democracy, development and reconciliation. The events that took place since October 26 have kept us wondering about what our elected representative is up to. We commenced this journey to instill a society where we couldlive peacefully"
In his opening remarks ousted Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that it is the pan (thachchiya) speaking and that everybody got together to make a hopper. We hoped for democracy, development and reconciliation. The events that took place since October 26 have kept us wondering about what our elected representative is up to. We commenced this journey to instill a society where we could live peacefully.
People started to become active on social media and fight for democracy. People participated in our rallies. With that we can be happy that we have strengthened democracy over the past three years. We established procedures to elect officials to office. We were able to allow institutions to function independently, Wickremesinghe said.
Meanwhile speaking at the SLFP convention, President Sirisena explained the present crisis in relation to duties carried out by a Viharadipathi (chief incumbent of a temple ) and Maha Nayaka (chief prelate). In his response, Wickremesinghe mentioned that this has nothing to do with a Viharadipathi or a Maha Nayaka, but it is an issue with the Vinaya Pitaka in reference to the Constitution. The country is governed by the Government and not the Executive. We have to take action against those who are violating the principles of the Constitution. We also have to abolish the Executive powers of the president, Wickremesinghe went on.

Good to see the democracy live and kicking
: Dr. Wickramaratne

"The elected representative has joined hands with the person we wanted to overthrow and has posed a threat on democracy. So we have to rescue democracy from the hands of both these individuals and thats the struggle we arefacing now"

We experienced an authoritarian regime sometime ago, Presidents Counsel and member of Parliament Dr. Jayampathy Wickramaratne said while delivering a speech under the topic Constitution Usurped. In order to overthrow that regime we appointed Maithripala Sirisena as the President. Three and a half years afterwards we are once again faced with an issue in terms of democracy. The elected representative has joined hands with the person we wanted to overthrow and has posed a threat on democracy. So we have to rescue democracy from the hands of both these individuals and thats the struggle we are facing now. Although it has been referred to as a constitutional coup, I would like to rephrase it as a political coup. On October 25 and 26 we passed various bills in Parliament and one of them was a Finance bill. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes Government showed a clear majority when the regulations were passed. That night, the President removed the Prime Minister against the powers vested upon him through the Constitution.
Then the person we overthrew, since he was a threat to democracy, was reappointed as the Prime Minister, he continued. He then decided to prorogue Parliament thinking that he would be able to secure 113 votes. But despite a few who decided to crossover and may return during the next few days, we have to be proud about our MPs for standing their ground and staying true to their principles. Even I was offered a sum, but we all know how important it was to bring about a change. Thereafter he dissolved Parliament; which was an unconstitutional move. We see people talking about the Constitution. Its good to see the democracy live and kicking, he added.
He further said that the 19A was brought to strengthen democracy of this country. It limited the powers of the President, functions of independent commissions were strengthened and the functioning of the judiciary was strengthened. This is why people are having high hopes on judgments. We removed his power to remove a Prime Minister. Therefore a Prime Minister could be removed only through the Parliament. This could be done either by defeating the budget, his manifesto or a No-Confidence Motion. But none of these events took place. The President would have expected MPs to support him, but that didnt happen as well. Wickremesinghe had the majority on October 26 as well, so hes the legitimate Prime Minister of the country. We have witnessed the crisis that the country has faced and it is quite evident that this situation arose due to misinterpretation of clauses in the Constitution, he said.

Political crisis will worsen economic crisis
: Abeyratne

"We should ensure that the present political litigation could be resolved through democratic debate and non-violent interventions. Since October 25 we have been a nation gripped in fear, confusion, angerand disrupt"
Sirimal Abeyratne, Professor of Economics at the University of Colombo, shed light on the impacts of the economy as a result of the present political crisis. Before we talk about where we are heading in terms of our economy, it is important to look at where we stand today. Asian countries are supposed to be the fastest developing economies. Out of these, China and countries in North Asia top the lists. But now it has shifted to countries in South Asia.This is because capital started flowing in from Western economies such as USA and they were directed towards Asian countries. It is in this backdrop that I received the report done by World Bank titled The South Asia Economic Focus. Unfortunately, Sri Lanka is not one of the countries with a fast developing economy. Sri Lanka lies just before Afghanistan and all other countries in South Asia are very much above Sri Lanka. As a result of a slowly developing economy we are unable to earn more income and even find employment, he explained.
Therefore we would face issues with regard to the Budget and foreign exchange, he continued. This affects tax rates and exports. The rupee was a currency that was continuously weakened. It was this rupee that got depreciated against the dollar over the past few months. This was due to the short-term impacts of foreign exchange which were feeding into the stock exchange and started moving out all of a sudden. Hence this political crisis occurred during a crucial moment where we required some strong policies to secure the rupee and strengthen the economy. Of course the Central Bank can release money, but how will we pay off our debts in that case Back in 2004, we exported goods amounting to USD 7 billion while Bangladesh also exported goods that summed to the same amount. But today, Bangladesh exports goods summing up to USD 38 billion while we export only USD 19 billion. We could have obtained more loans from other countries, but recently credit rating agencies ranked Sri Lanka as a weak country for acquiring loans. Hence even if we recover our stability in another week or two, the unpleasant precedence created through the series of events over the past few days will have a long term impact on the country, he added.

We shouldnt take time for granted
: Rajasingam
Speaking on the topic of democratic reforms and reconciliation, social activist and attorney-at-law Maithreyi Rajasingam said that the last few weeks have been exhilarating and stressful at the same time. We should ensure that the present political crisis could be resolved through democratic debate and non-violent interventions. Since October 25 we have been a nation gripped in fear, confusion, anger and disrupt, regardless of where we stand in the political spectrum,. One factor that has stood out is the Constitution . As citizens of Sri Lanka, we have been unsure about what the Constitution says and what the rights of the people are. We have heard arguments and counter-arguments, legal interpretations and loopholes from time to time. In every instance it is either unclear or lines have been manipulated to suit their own personal agendas.
said Rajasingam.
We have been a country devastated with an armed conflict. We have seen abductions, kidnappings and massacres. Now is the time to really ask if we are going to sit back and watch or stand up and voice out against unlawful practices. We need to take steps towards change and not take time for granted, she said in her concluding remarks.

	A Prime Minister could be removed only through the Parliament
	
	
	The President would have expected MPs to support him, but that didnt happen as well
	
	
	We need to take steps towards change and not take time for granted
	
	
	As citizens of Sri Lanka, we have been unsure about what the Constitution says and what the rights of the people are
	

Towards the end of the event a few participants aired their views.

We are in a crisis situation
- Harsha Ranasinghe
Todays programme is a huge success. We are in a crisis situation with no Prime Minister and no Government. There are many problems in the country because of the President. So he has to take a decision to
restore democracy.

We need to safeguard democracy
-Kanishka Banagala
This is all about democracy. Irrelevant of parties people have gotten together to fight for democracy. We obtained democracy after a huge struggle and we need to respect and safeguard it.


I think RW has won his battle
-Shereena Abdulla
People raised their voice for democracy. We are all here for democracy and we are happy to have a large number of professionals join in today. The Party deserves this support because the President has been disgracing the Prime Minister and has set a bad example. I think RW has won his battle.

I want to have democracy
-Kalani Waduge


The main objective is the democracy. I want to have democracy in this country and thats why I came here today.


It is also important to talk about reconciliation
- Eesha Wedasinghe
We were not talking about the economy at all. So that was new to us. It is also important to talk about reconciliation. Now we need to take this message to therural sector.

The country is experiencing a dark era
- Chithrangani Mubarak
I basically wanted to get everything from the horses mouth. The country is experiencing a dark era and we need to get out of it.



Im very much passionate about the country
- Niranjali Silva
I want to support the democratic rights and the upholding of democracy. I dont live here, but Im very much passionate about the country and want it to be the way it used to be.

Removing power of dissolution seeks to cannibalize Constitution: Counsel
	
Presidents Counsel Sanjeeva Jayawardena in his submission stated that what the Petitioners invoke to the Court is to distort the Constitution virtually to cannibalize it and to take away the check and balance by removing the power of dissolution of Parliament by the President.
Counsel Jayawardena appearing for Intervenient Petitioner Prof. G.L.Peiris of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) made his submission before the Supreme Court Bench of seven judges on the fundamental rights petition against the declaration of dissolution of Parliament by President.

Presidents Counsel Jayawardena continuing his submission said they are doing so by invoking merely a proviso and to ignore main substantive Articles 62(2) and 33(2)(C ) of the Constitution which goes to substantiate the power to President to dissolve Parliament.
Petitioners wrongfully advocated to the cannibalization of the Constitution and virtually extracting the teeth of power of the President engaging in the process of surgical transplant of mere proviso in a complete different Chapter of the Constitution and transpose that proviso artificially to a different Chapter of the Constitution, he said.
It also makes a mockery of the sovereign right of the people vested in the President to use the process of dissolution in a fit case by as check and balance of Parliament, he stated.
This is important in a situation where there is a complete breakdown of Parliamentary function as well as irresolvable impasse and a total breakdown of governance which ultimately affects the people of the country and constituency, he added.
Only way to resolve to resolve the crisis is to re-impose the franchise of the people by directing the conduct of a general election for the governance can duly resume otherwise ultimately the people not the politicians who are affected, and the people can be made to suffer the breakdown of governance, he said.
There were 10 fundamental rights petition filed against the declaration of dissolution of Parliament by the President. Five sought to intervene to counter the main petitions.
Petitions seek a declaration that proclamation of dissolving Parliament infringes the fundamental rights.
They ask the Court for a declaration that the decisions and/or directions in the proclamation is null and void ab initio (ineffective from the beginning) and of no force or effect in law.
The petitions were filed by Kabir Hashim and Akila Viraj Kariyawasam of UNP, Lal Wijenayeke of United Left Front, CPA, Member of the Election Commission Prof. Ratnajeevan. H. Hoole, Attorney-at-Law G.C.T. Perera, Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, All Ceylon Makkal Congress, Mano Ganesan MP.

SLPP blasts RW for meeting envoys at Temple Trees
	
The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) today criticized United National Party (UNP) Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe for meeting foreign ambassadors and high commissioners at Temple Trees on Wednesday.
MP Shehan Semasinghe said entertaining foreign envoys at Temple Trees was a misuse of public property.
The UNP still continues to venerate foreign embassies and high commissions. How can a prime minister who was removed from the post entertain envoys at Temple Trees Today, the official residence of the prime minister is being used for conspiracies. It has become a haven for conspirators," he told a news briefing.
Mr. Semasinghe said the UNP had failed to nominate someone other than Mr. Wickremesinghe to the post of Prime Minister because of an internal crisis in the party.
President Maithripala Sirisena has clearly said he would not reappoint Mr. Wickremesinghe to the post of prime minister. But the UNP has been unable to put nominate another member because of internal issues," he said.
Commenting on the recent parliamentary sessions, Mr. Semasinghe said Speaker Karu Jayasuriya should be held responsible for convening these sessions by spending tax payers money. All these sessions were held to promote one political party, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

TELOs demands and the national  question - EDITORIAL
	

he support of Tamil minority parties to elect a government has never received such importance as of now. The United National Party (UNP) is hellbent on obtaining the support of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) in its bid to form a Government which will have a nominee from the Green Party for the prime ministerial post.
But one party of the alliance, Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO) maintains quite staunchly that its support would only be offered if several demands are met.
Some of these demands are rather sensitive, but TELO finds itself in a position to make a key player in the political equation like the UNP listen to the voice of the Tamils.
Out of these demands, the ones to release LTTE suspects (who they term as Tamil political prisoners) and to repeal and prevent the Prevention of Terrorism Act are disturbing. This is because we still hear of violent acts taking place in the north; often those disturbing the peace there have been gangs armed with swords.
Recently the killing of two policemen in Vavunathevu raised some eyebrows in Colombo and posed questions as to whether the security is adequate in the north
Going by the pulse of the people in the North, the northerners dread a war again and say that much was lost during the almost three-decade strife which brought buildings to the ground and took the lives of thousands of innocent Tamils. Some say its a miracle that a Tamil community up in the north survived to tell a story of blood, tears and bombs. The sporadic incidents of violence however give the indication that the north is still not fully stable and demands some form of a military presence.
The TNA is not so aggressive with these demands and maintains that they should not be presented in writing. In fact the majority forming the TNA is said to be on a different line of thinking when it comes to presenting the grievances of the Tamil community.
The perspective of the Tamils has never been included in the countrys thinking machine which decides which way the country is progressing. A good example is the recent decision taken by president Sirisena to dissolve parliament. The Tamils now pose the question why on earth he did that when the majority of Sri Lankans including most Tamils voted for Sirisena having faith that he would continue with his Cabinet for a period of five years. Tamils now feel betrayed by Sirisena.
Wanni Parliamentarian Shanthi Sriskandarajah has said that the Tamils have been sidelined as a community. But she is quick to point out that the present times are such that the major National parties have to kneel down before Tamil parties to obtain support and survive in politics.
The TELO maintains that the TNA didnt resolve the problems of the Tamils and that it cant trust the UNP.
Politics in Sri Lanka has boiled down to a question of trust. One must fathom that if the majority Sinhalese cant trust their own lawmakers then what helpless position would a minority community like the Tamils be in at present!
In this context the TELO has decided to seize the opportunity when the UNP now can be brought to the negotiating table, for the sake of the
Tamil community.
The TELO has also decided to be vociferous with its demands given that the TNA has been rather passive in its dealings with Government decision makers. The controlling party of the alliance ITAK is said to be maintaining a stark silence these days; hence the rhetoric of the TELO.
If there was one good thing which came out of the whole Yahapalama regime it was the absence of a fear psychosis in the north. Military surveillance was almost absent there. This is a past, even if its small as three and half years, that Tamils would cherish. This is one reason why the TELO is eager to negotiate and strike a deal with the UNP. Can anyone blame the TELO for its thinking

125th Anniversary of St Sylvesters Church at Ettukala: St. Sylvester: much known in Sri Lanka
	
When proceeding from Negombo to Chilaw on the main road, turning to seaside from the Kattuwa Junction and continuing a few meters on Ettukala Road, one would not miss the sight of a beautiful Church of great architectural value.
This Church, dedicated to Saint Sylvester, is now ready to celebrate its 125th Jubilee.
Saint Sylvester is much known in Sri Lanka and the Church at Ettukala is a church dedicated to the Saint.
He was born in 1177 AD in Italy to a rich and an elite family. His father was an attorney. The young Sylvester was admitted to the University in Bologna with the aim of making him also an Attorney.
However, at the University he chose Theology instead of Law and completed his higher studies in this field. His father disliked him for choosing Theology instead of Law.
On most occasions when he was absorbed in prayer he had visions inviting him to join religious congregations.
In one of these visions, Saint Benedict appeared to him and invited him to accept the Holy Law and Priestly vestments.
Sylvester selected a lonely area where wild animals roamed about, known as Montefano to set up a hermitage. There had been many followers, who preferred to live the simple life.
There were many youths who emulated Sylvester and joined his mission.
It is believed that many ferocious animals were at his feet and obeying his commands. Those who came to visit him feared a large number of animals around Sylvester, but none of them attacked the people.
In one instance it is believed that a youth who opted to be a follower of Sylvester came to the hermitage but he was forcibly dragged away by his parents while one of the parents slapped Sylvester. Later on, the parent who slapped Sylvester had suffered from Leprosy in the hand.
Many miracles had been attributed to this Saint. Many blind persons had their visions restored. Deaf and dumb had been cured.
Later, with the commencement of the Sylvester Benedictine Order, there were a large number of followers flocked to join this order, which was inaugurated with the blessings of the Holy Father, Pope Innocent 1V. In Sri Lanka, the Ampitiya Montefano, Mother House of the Sylvester Benedictine Order stands tall as the Premier Seminary, where a large number of Priests undergo training and do their higher studies.
History records that Sylvester lived for ninety years and died on November 26, 1267.
At the time of his death, those who were at his bedside had seen a vision of Angels carrying away his Soul into heaven.
In 1598 he was Canonized by Pope Clement VIII.
Annually, the feast of Saint Sylvester was celebrated on November 26 each year.
As the 125th Jubilee of this Church falls this year the feast of Saint Sylvester would be celebrated on December 9.
Relics of this great Saint and those of Saint Benedict, are placed inside a statue of Saint Sylvester at this church for veneration by the devotees.

## Section: Opinion

The Rajapaksas, the SLPP and the unfolding Indo-Pacific Great Game
	

he current political impasse in Sri Lanka marks an important opportunity for Mahinda and Gotabaya Rajapaksa to think about the consequences of their current actions for future support from the United States and others for a government a Rajapaksa could be elected to lead next year. 
Despite two no-confidence motions against Prime Minister Rajapaksas Government and two motions to halt funding for government ministries, Mr. Rajapaksa has refused tostep down. 

"The Rajapaksas enjoyed famously good relations with China during Mahindas presidency"
His refusal not only calls into question his and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramunas (SLPPs) adherence to Sri Lankas Constitution, it begs the question why they are inflicting unnecessary wounds on their and the SLPPs future. 
The strong showing of Rajapaksa and the SLPP in local council elections earlier this year demonstrated the support Rajapaksa continues to enjoy in Sri Lanka. New presidential elections could be called early next year. Although Mahinda Rajapaksa is prohibited by the Constitution from running again for presidency, his brother Gotabaya could be a strong contender. 

"A new MCC programme for Sri Lanka is now under consideration"
The Rajapaksas enjoyed famously good relations with China during Mahindas presidency. China financed the port of Hambantota and several other mega projects. The Hambantota port project has since become a cautionary tale for all recipients of Chinas Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) largesse. When Sri Lanka could not service its debt payments, China instead negotiated equity control of the port for itself. 
Since then, newly-elected governments in the Maldives, Pakistan and Malaysia all have announced reviews of BRI projects in their countries to be sure these projects benefit their countries and will generate good rates of return that would enable them to service their debt to China.
Indeed, as Xi Jinping doubles down on BRI and continues projects that will give Beijing the capacity to exert control over international waters in the South China Sea, countries across Asia increasingly want to maintain good relations with the United States, Japan, India and others to counter-balance Chinas growing economic and military influence. 

	SL well-positioned to benefit from new Indo-Pacific initiatives
	
	
	Results of recent mid-term polls in US to bring added scrutiny on SL
	
The United States, and other members of the Quad - India, Japan and Australia  have responded by enunciating a broad Indo-Pacific strategy to ensure a free, open and prosperous Indo-Pacific. The US also passed the Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development (BUILD) Act earlier this year, creating a new International Development Finance Corporation (IDFC) to incentivize US corporations and institutional investors to invest in developing countries and provide an alternative financing mechanism to Chinas BRI. The IDFC complements new US Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) projects in countries that meet a host of good governance criteria. A new MCC programme for Sri Lanka is now under consideration. Japan and others have developed their own international infrastructure and Indo-Pacific initiatives. 

	Hambantota port project a cautionary tale for all recipients of Chinas Belt and Road Initiative(BRI) largesse
	
	
	SL should expect more intensive congressional review of its recent actions, which could impact SLs access to financing from the new IDFC or the MCC
	
Sri Lanka -- with its strategic location on the busiest sea lanes in the Indian Ocean, its literate population and the tentative steps it had taken to achieve reconciliation after its bloody war with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) -- had been well-positioned to benefit from these new Indo-Pacific initiatives. 
But President Sirisenas and Prime Minister Rajapaksas recent actions have raised serious questions in Washington, New Delhi, Tokyo and elsewhere, about their commitment to democracy and good governance. The results of the recent mid-term elections in the United States will bring added scrutiny on Sri Lanka. The Democratic Party won back control of the House of Representatives and announced that promotion of human rights and democracy would be a priority. So Sri Lanka should expect more intensive congressional review of its recent actions, which could impact Sri Lankas access to financing from the new IDFC or the MCC.
The above analysis suggests that Mr. Rajapaksa would be wise to step down as Prime Minister, and instead put his considerable political skills toward helping the SLPP win next years presidential elections through a free and fair contest. This would resolve the current political impasse and position Sri Lanka to be a leader and winner as the new Indo-Pacific great game unfolds.

Ambassador Robert Blake served as US Ambassador to Sri Lanka from 2006 to 2009 and then as Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia from 2009 to 2013.
He retired from the US Government in 2016 and now advises US business overseas on behalf of
McLarty Associates.

TNA could be the saviour
	
Can the TNA by supporting the UNP to form a Government save the day

he essence of the special statement made on Sunday by Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was prevented from acting as Prime Minister by the Appeal Court on Monday, was nothing new.
While attempting to find parallels between the dissolution of Parliament by President Maithripala Sirisena on November 9 and dissolution of Parliaments of several other countries under various circumstances, he stressed the need to go for a General Election in order to bring in a stable Government through a fresh composition of Parliament.
Apart from his comparison of dissolution of Parliament in Sri Lanka last month and in other countries in the past is misleading, as the Lawyers for Democracy pointed out, the main point he was attempting to drive home the need for a General Election- was something that had been canvassed by his group for the past several weeks.Hence, it is puzzling as to how the statement became special.
However, an important aspect that has to be taken into account in his address was his open attempt to influence the Judiciary that had already taken up for Consideration 13 petitions against the dissolution of Parliament by the President.

"An important aspect that has to be taken into account in his address was his open attempt to influence the Judiciary that had already taken up for Consideration 13 petitions against the dissolution of Parliament by the President"
The Supreme Court had heard the submissions on the dissolution on November 12 and 13 and was to resume hearing on December 4 when he made this special statement.
Besides indirectly influencing the case by his comparison of dissolution of Parliament in Sri Lanka and other countries, he made a direct reference to Article 70 (1) of the Constitution as well which is under consideration by the Supreme Court.
A Rajapaksa loyalist might contend that his statement was not sub-judice since many people discuss in the media the issues currently under consideration by the Supreme Court.
Yet, the propriety of a statement by a person who identifies himself as the Prime Minister of the country and more importantly, who is a stakeholder of the said case, is questionable.
On the same day, Ven. Athureliye Rathana Thera, who has now teamed up with Rajapaksa, after contesting the Parliamentary Elections in August 2015 under the Elephant symbol of the United National Party (UNP) directly addressed to the Court, while calling for a General Election.
He said that the court had to take into account the current political impasse when it delivered the Judgment.
This was not only influencing the court but also against the court procedures we know. Normally courts are expected to consider only the facts and arguments placed before them, disregarding other happenings outside the courtroom.
These attempts to influence the Court seem to be calculated and not accidental, as posters with slogans Nadukara Hamuduruwane apata ape chandaya denna (Ven. judges, give us our vote- meaning give us a General Election) had sprung up in many parts of the country, while they were making these statements.
Given these developments, what can one expect if such cases are heard when Rajapaksa is in power
With Rajapaksa loyalists also taking one issue before the Judiciary, the country is waiting for the outcome of three petitions pertaining to the current political quagmire, with bated breath.

"A statement by a stakeholder of the said case is questionable if it was sub-Judice"
Apart from the petition against the dissolution, another one had been filed by the former head of Civil Security Department Sarath Weerasekara, seeking a declaration against the convening of Parliament, in the light of the dissolution of it.
A third one has been filed by Ranil Wickremesinghe who was ousted as Prime Minister by the President on October 26 and 121 other Parliamentarians seeking a declaration preventing Rajapaksa and 48 MPs from functioning as Prime Minister and Ministers.
Already two interim orders have been delivered by the Supreme Court and the Appeal Court, to the disappointment of President Maithripala Sirisena and Mahinda Rajapaksa.The Supreme Court on November 13 issued an order temporarily suspending the Gazette notification issued by the President dissolving the Parliament, while the Appeal Court issued another order on Monday (December 3) preventing Rajapaksa and another 48 persons from acting as Prime Minister and ministers.
In fact, the submissions before the courts sometimes highly tilted- by the high ranking lawyers in the country on these matters and the interim and final outcomes of these cases would no doubt be highly valuable for the students of law and those interested in politics.
However, very few even among the educated people seem to be looking at them objectively. A large majority is highly politicized and they want to see their point of view is carried by hook or by crook, come what may.
Now a strange situation has been created by the interim orders of the courts and the two no-confidence motions passed in the Parliament against Rajapaksa and his Cabinet. Following the interim order on the Quo-Warranto Writ Petition against Rajapaksas purported premiership and his purported ministers, the country is for the first time in the history without a government accepted at least by a section of the Parliament. Earlier, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had announced that neither Wickremesinghe nor Rajapaksa was acceptable as Prime Minister. Yet, he convened the Parliament. After the interim order on the Quo-Warranto Writ Petition also he convened the Parliament on Wednesday. Can the Parliament meet under a situation where there is no government in the country

"Very few even among the educated people seem to be looking at them objectively."
One has to look forward to one of four scenarios depending on the final outcome of the hearing on the petition against the dissolution of Parliament and the Quo-Warranto Writ Petition. One is a situation where dissolution of the Parliament might be upheld while the legality of the Rajapaksa government might also be endorsed by the court. Another situation that might arise is where Dissolution is upheld but the legality of the Rajapaksa government is not. Thirdly, the Supreme Court might declare the gazette notification on the dissolution null and void while the Rajapaksa regime could be declared legal. Also, there is a possibility of both the dissolution and the legality of the Rajapaksa government might be declared invalid. In the first scenario, an immediate general election will be held under a caretaker government headed by Rajapaksa while the second will produce a situation where there is no Parliament as well as a caretaker government. If the third option has to be accepted Rajapaksa would have to rule the country at least until February 2020 without a majority in Parliament. And fourthly, current Parliament would continue but the President would have to appoint a Prime Minister.
Rajapaksa and his Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) will prefer the first scenario immediate election under Rajapaksas caretaker Government- and Wickremesinghe and the UNP will prefer the last option  Parliament continuing with a new Prime Minister.
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party led by President Sirisena will be benefitted only by the third scenario- a Rajapaksa rule without a majority- as Rajapaksa would have to depend heavily on the executive powers of President Sirisena.
The best option for the UNP would be the worst for the President as he would have to appoint a new Premier, most likely from the ranks of the UNP.
He says he would never appoint Wickremesinghe. Now, that the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) has announced that it would support the UNP to form a Government, can the President reject Wickremesinghe in case all MPs of the two parties request him to do so in writing
The Constitution says The President shall appoint as Prime Minister the member of Parliament, who in Presidents opinion is most likely to command the confidence of Parliament.

"These attempts to influence the Court seem to be calculated and not accidental, as posters.. Given these developments, what can one expect if such cases are heard when Rajapaksa is in power"

It uses the word shall and not may.Even if such a UNP Government is formed again, needless to say, that only a general election would save the country from the current quagmire, despite it causing the danger of bringing about a hung Parliament again. Though Wickremesinghe says that country can go for an election under a legitimate government, meaning a UNP led government, one cannot give an assurance that the UNP would stick to its words and support a motion in Parliament to dissolve it.
Hence, only the TNA by supporting the UNP to form a Government with a condition to dissolve Parliament can save the day.

Towards  a school of radicals
	

Sri Lanka is witnessing a constitutional experiment that is fast turning out to be elitist and exclusionary. A popular mandate seems to be dwarfed by an unelected Regency. (Sarath de Alwis, in 2015)
Somewhere in 2016, Thisuri Wanniarachchi wrote an article criticising, among other things, the culture of Big Matches and school fraternities in Sri Lanka. She seemed to believe that these were symptomatic of; a) social and intellectual backwardness, since for her they seemed to indicate that past pupils believed school was the farthest they can get in life; b) misogyny, with regard to the segregation between boys and girls schools; and c) homophobia, since students from boys schools revel in flaunting themselves as drag queens at cycle parades. If ever an award is presented for articles that attracted the most hype in a given year, Thisuris article will get top honours for 2016. People wrote about it, people wrote against it, some supported her stance, and many others (including myself) wrote it off as set of rants and raves and sweeping, crass generalisations. Still, in hindsight, I believe it was valid.
A close friend of mine, who calls himself a child of 1956, once lamented that most of our schools, especially those demarcated as privileged and popular, tend to de-radicalise those who enter them. For the record, this person was a past student of one of these popular schools, though he had cut off virtually all contact with it after he left. He argued (cogently, I should think), that an education system over which we spend more time spawning its own sense of self-worth, in the form of those notions of what is popular and elite and what is not, can only lead to the intensification of the rifts and deficits that have assailed our society for so long.
My friend got the point Thisuri didnt (or almost got): at present, our education system, particularly when it comes to our schools, are (as she put it correctly) socially malnourished. But this is not ONLY because they reflect misogyny and homophobia and what not, even though these are problems that are relevant and pressing. Rather, it is because they dont teach us enough to look beyond the four walls within which we are sheltered; in short, that they dont teach us to open up our minds.
No, this is not about whether our schools (can) breed original thinkers. Theres no denying that they do. But thinkers who go as far as to question the very institutions of power that nurture them: these are, I feel, sorely lacking today.
Im not suggesting that we do not have radicals; rather, the radicalism they spout tends to be undone by ideological obfuscations. Just look at the radicals who made the headlines with their links with a State-owned corporation that is alleged to have doled money to them in return for their radicalism (I am talking about those Yahalapanist propagandists, by the way). Just look at the protestors who were there, ostensibly out of a love for democracy, but in fact out of a love for the person who had been ousted by the President. Given this, where are the REAL radicals
We live in a country where out of 10,162 national schools, only 867 have adequate facilities for science education. We live in a country where regions recording the highest income disparities, especially Moneragala, produce the highest number of arts graduates, many of whom, because of those prejudiced views of artistes we cherish dearly, end up on the road as picketers, protesters, and peddlers. Given that the system has been geared for the few, then, what should the role of the few be In other words, how should we address the deficit between the 867 and the 10,162 It is a question that no amount of reforms and commissions has resolved.
What makes it even worse is the fact that, for the most, the system runs on a fiction of equality in terms of teaching and exam material. A student in Kekirawa may get the same paper a student in Kurunduwatte does (dumbed down, so the defenders of the system tell us, to accommodate the Kekirawa student), but it will not compensate for the fact that the Kekirawa school does not have labs and adequate provisions to hold practical exams for potential science stream students.
The counter-argument to this is that the standardisation of results (the Z-score) ensures that a student from Kekirawa has as much a chance as a student from Kurunduwatte to enter university. Again, however, even if the Kurunduwatte student gets 3As and still cant enter, and a student from a less privileged background gets 2As and 1 B and does, this will not conceal the deeper structural rifts, in terms of qualified teachers, classroom facilities, and so on, between Kekirawa and Kurunduwatte.

"Max Weber observed that in every structure of domination, there is a mechanism through which power relations are transformed to sanctified rights "
The most typical response I get from the entrenched (read, privileged) young is that there is no point in gearing the system to the advantage of the unprivileged, since the unprivileged are driven by a campaign of resentment and envy against them: Theres no point talking about it, because at the end of the day they will always want to deny us the things we were born to, through no fault of our own.
Was this not the same perception that coloured the prejudices of those from Ranil Wickremesinghes Reid Avenue clique against the multitude, the same multitude over whom were imposed, in the aftermath of the UNP victory in 2015, a set of beliefs that (as Dayan Jayatilleka wrote) affronted their national identity What else could explain the cabalistic, ineffable elitism of the crowd that rallied around Ranil and the UNP for no reason other than the fact that they belonged to a certain class: a class of first-class thieves and robbers, who perpetuated the myth that gentlemen dont rob (as my friend the poet of Thimbirigasyaya put it, we are wont to call thugs with names like Soththi Upali and Baddegana Sanjeewa, but we are shy to refer to the former Central Bank Governor, even in jest or half-jest, as Pamankada Arjuna).
The privileged, in other words, have been de-radicalised from an early age, and it is this problem, rather than the problem of misogyny and homophobia Thisuri wrote on, that has prevented elite schools from nurturing progressivism in their vicinity. This problem, however, is more complex than a simple/simplistic battle between the elite and the subaltern, and while I will say that such a battle exists and is being waged within our schools even now (the many against the few), it does not deserve the kind of generalisations commentators tend to paste over their tracts against it.
The fact is that these institutions of privilege are no longer the preserve of the wealthy; rather, they are now the preserve of a multitude of milieus from the elite AND the subaltern, both affiliated to that cabalistic, ineffable culture of elitism. Ranil and his regency were hence not celebrated from this subset by the English-speaking crowd only: they were celebrated by the monolingual subaltern as well, many of whom probably couldnt put five English words together.
In other words, they were revelling in a kind of anti-radical elitism that superficially was based on membership of a clan not rooted in money or power, but was in actual fact rooted in a compradore, petty merchant class. The subaltern section of this young bourgeoisie (which included the rural petite bourgeoisie, i.e. those who hail from the scholarship milieu), in other words, were (mindlessly) celebrating the victory of a group of privileged, bewildered, and outmoded dinosaurs.

"Out of 10,162 national schools, only 867 have adequate facilities for science education"
This underclass, thus relishing in their membership of that elitist hub, laid aside the reality of the social stratifications which had relegated them, from birth, to the lower orders. I find this to be less of a farce than a tragedy, and Im sure Marx would agree. Some people are fond of comparing sections of the ethnic minorities calling for the return of Mahinda Rajapaksa to Jews calling for the triumph of the Third Reich. By that logic, the Reid Avenue subalterns allied with Ranil Wickremesinghe and his Colombo 7 clique can be compared to serfs celebrating the return of the Tsar.
Max Weber, whom I never fail to go back to, observed that in every structure of domination, there is a mechanism through which power relations (which are material) are transformed to sanctified rights (which are symbolic). In feudal societies, Loc Wacquant once observed, it was the church that facilitated this transformation; in modern societies, he surmised, it was the school.
Wacquant made this point in his foreword to the seminal work of the role that schools play in perpetuating rifts in society, The State Nobility. It was written by another eminent sociologist, in my opinion one of the greatest from the second half of the preceding century, Pierre Bourdieu. Now I am not a social theorist by any stretch of the imagination, but I feel that what Bourdieu wrote can be applied to our schools as well; a fiction of equality, celebrated by educationists, thrives on a set of structural anomalies, all of which rest on the advantages gained by the 867 over the 10,162. We need to address that. And fast. For that though, we need radicals. Are they ready

UNP to decide on next move after SC verdict
	
The UNP will decide on its next course of action including the likelihood of a secret ballot to select a candidate for the premiership after the Supreme Court delivers its Judgment today, with regard to the petition filed against the dissolution of Parliament, Party Spokesman Harin Fernando said yesterday.
Mr. Fernando was responding to reports that the UNF was preparing to have a secret ballot to decide on a suitable person to take over the Premiership.
We will decide on the next course of action only after the Supreme Court delivers its judgment on the dissolution of Parliament today, he said.
We will have to think of our next move especially if an election is going to be held, he added.
President Maithriapala Sirisena on Tuesday said current leader of UNP Ranil Wickremeisnghe will not be appointed as the Prime Minister even if all 225 MPs tell him to do so. (Yohan Perera)

Where are the PEOPLE 
	
Hectic behind-the-scene manipulations, manoeuvrings, scheming and negotiations taking place

Searching for truth is not searching for what you like-Albert Camus
Sri Lanka now lives with two temporary Stay Orders from the Judiciary; the Appeal Court and the Supreme Court. Sri Lanka now lives with a Parliament that is dysfunctional and in chaos every time it meets.
It is now without a proper elected Government with a cabinet of Ministers. This would drag on for a few more days at least, with speculations as to what the outcome of the presently deliberated FR petitions in the Supreme Court would be. It is now expected the Supreme Court would provide a final answer within the Constitution, early next week, perhaps on Monday.Meanwhile, hectic behind-the-scene manipulations, manoeuvrings, scheming and negotiations take place as never heard of, in post independent Ceylon, now Sri Lanka.
The crisis or rather the political brawl erupted is over the Premiership that President Sirisena changed from Wickramasinghe to Rajapaksa on 26 of October.The first such tussle for Premiership in post independent Ceylon emerged within the UNP after the untimely death of Prime Minister D.S. Senanayake in March 1952.
With Bandaranaike out of running having left the UNP in July 1951, Sir John Kotalawala was a strong contender to the PM post.
That saw many deals being bargained and negotiated by Senator and Minister of Home Affairs and Rural Development Sir Oliver Goonatilleke, a formidable figure among elites in Colombo politics and a strong and an efficient negotiator, the diminutive General Secretary of the UNP, Sir Ukwatte Jayasundera QC.
They were obliged to honour the request made by DS to have his son Dudley as PM.
The deals were done and over within a few days and Dudley was sworn in as PM in a week. A crisis around appointing a new PM, never felt by the people, never stalled the Parliament and the need of judicial intervention never arising nor even thought of.

"Supreme Court expected to provide a final answer within the Constitution, early next week"
Those were good old days where politicians were far more civilised than now and political parties behaved with decency.
Today, with a group of peoples representatives that can teach how street brawls should be fought, this conflict over who the constitutionally and rightfully appointed PM is, have gone out of the Legislature into the Judiciary, it keeps the ExecutivePresident working right round the clock and political leaders split hairs working out their Plan B in case things go out of their hands.
In this rush, perhaps for the first time in independent Sri Lanka, most saintly and honourable public personalities had their respected images exposed in public.The soft but emotional public speaker Sirisena, who came as the Common Candidate against President Rajapaksa and was voted as President in 2015 January, was then hugged by the Colombo middleclass as the Asian reincarnation of Mandela.
Today he is left ridiculed and detested by the very same urban middleclass.
PM Wickremesinghe was the trusted political leader, the Western allies wanted in charge of the Government and was dubbed Mr. Clean.Today he is with a heavy baggage accused of mega corruption beginning with the CBSL Bond Scam and is accused of a badly run economy fast on the decline.The conflicts between the two main partners in a Government that was installed to keep Rajapaksa permanently at bay, has failed in every aspect of governing (2017 GDP growth slumped to an all time low in a decade to 3.7%) and has bred frustration among people.
The two leaders that came together on a rainbow revolution are thus responsible for Rajapaksas return to centre stage.The return of Rajapaksa to the main stage, exposes the few Western diplomats, who advise Sri Lanka as friends to behave democratically.
In this post WW II world, many countries they walked through are living with bleeding tragedies despite their preaching on democracy.
With no lack of funds, the Colombo civil society is on the streets, also demanding democracy but does not want Parliament dissolved, denying the people of their sovereign right to elect a Government of their choice.

"People should be brought back as the final Decision Makers"
As argued in these pages before, this political brawl for power that allows access to everything profitable in this open market economy, cannot be resolved to a finish through constitutional and legal processes.
The Constitution itself is flawed, more after the much venerated 19A, and is reflected in how the two parties in this political brawl use different Articles and Clauses from the same Constitution.Despite such contradictions and confusions over who is right and what is right, the whole conflict is yet restricted to higher judicial forums and to a wild and corrupt parliament that no more represents the People.
The Supreme Court (SC) decision is the most important decision awaited for on Monday and can only be one of two; accept the November 09 Gazette Notification dissolving Parliament as valid, or ruling it unconstitutional, on whatever grounds the seven-member bench reads as right and justifiable.
It could even be a divided decision, but the majority ruling goes as the SC decision when read out in open Court.
While one could only keep guessing what their decision could be, on a hypothetical note, if the SC decides the Gazette is invalid and is unconstitutional, then the status quo that has to be accepted is that of November 08, the day before the Gazette was issued.
That brings back Rajapaksa as PM and the Cabinet of Ministers sworn in after the October 26 Gazette that appointed him as PM.
In fact, that Gazette has not been challenged in any Court of Law and also moving two No Confidence Motions against PM Rajapaksa meant the UNP, the TNA and the JVP accepted him as PM, they only argued had no majority in Parliament.
Yet, there are two more hurdles Rajapaksa has to clear, before he emerges as the constitutionally accepted head of government in such political scenario.His appeal to the SC against the temporary stay order issued by the Appeal Court on a Quo Warranto writ application and the hearing of the same writ application on 12 December in the Appeal Court, if the SC leaves the decision for the Appeal Court to decide.A Quo Warranto is one exclusively used to test a persons legal right to hold a public office.

"A Quo Warranto is one exclusively used to test a persons legal right to hold a public office."
In this case, what is tested is the post of Prime Minister and posts of Cabinet Ministers. The interpretation of a Public Officer in Article 170 of the Constitution, says, Public officer means a person who holds any paid office under the Republic other than a judicial officer, but does not include  (a) the President (b) the Prime Minister (c) the Speaker (d) a Minister (e) a Deputy Minister (f) a Member of Parliament and also all members of the Constitutional Council and members of independent Commissions.
Be that as it may, whatever decisions the judiciary finally reach, this parliament cannot get back to decent and civilised handling of business, unless there is a sound compromise between the two main contenders, the UNP leadership and Rajapaksa. The only possibility of a compromise now lies with Wickramasinghe publicly saying, the UNP would agree to a Parliamentary election under a legitimate Government.
What he basically says is, he would agree to an election if he is allowed to head the Government as PM, with his Cabinet of Ministers.There no doubt is a barrier for now. President Sirisena with his illogical and angry statements made against Wickremesinghe remains to be tamed for a compromise. Sirisenas empty and angry statements apart, there is no reason why Rajapaksa cannot and should not agree to Wickremesinghes offer with a public statement.
If an election is what Rajapaksa and his SLPP wants, who heads the Government is not one that should scare him from compromising with Wickremesinghe.Elections are held under the National Elections Commission (NEC) and not under any Government.Rajapaksa did face the 2018 February LG elections held by the NEC with a UNP government in office headed by Wickramasinghe as PM and President Sirisena also against his SLPP. One only needs an immediate Resolution in Parliament presented by Wickramasinghe as PM to dissolve itself and hold elections in three months for a compromise to take effect.Bottom line is, as I have previously argued in these pages, people who were completely left out of this political brawl, should be brought back as the final Decision Makers at an election for some stability and civility to be achieved in a new parliament.

"This political brawl for power that allows access to everything profitable in this open market economy, cannot be resolved to a finish through constitutional and legal processes."
Whatever the outcome of judicial interventions would be next week, whatever placards the funded democracy activists in Colombo may raise, it is Wickremesinghes offer for an election under his Government that should be compromised upon for sanity to prevail and personal egos to die.
Wish Rajapaksa and his SLPP would seize that opportunity to end this ugly political brawl.

Winning brownie points at the expense of subordinates!
	

A star-sporting khaki high-up in a district South of the city is said to be deploying his subordinates in a diverse extraneous activity designed to win brownie points from political bigwigs in the district, they say.

His subordinates are not granted leave even for an urgent purpose like taking a sick child to a physician as they are constantly required for certain odd jobs which have nothing to do with their normal duties.
This high  up has made it a practice to summon subordinates away on leave for special traffic duty and arresting army deserters and suspects under court warrants.
This high-up has the knack for getting around the political bigwigs in the district no matter what the government is, for his personal benefits, they say.
