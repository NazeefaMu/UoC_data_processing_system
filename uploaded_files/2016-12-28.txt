Another victim of the game that knows no rules
	
?
A move made to appoint an ambassador to head our diplomatic mission in Berlin has run into a tangle, they say.
?
Government initially decided to appoint a senior foreign service diplomat to fill this key post now vacant and the concurrence of the German government for the appointment too was duly obtained. And then came a communication from a high authority recommending that a certain lady much junior to the initial choice be appointed. So they cancelled the first appointment and sought German government?s concurrence for the second choice.?
Meanwhile, the senior high-ups in the foreign service got highly perturbed on hearing that an injustice had been done to a senior colleague of theirs to make way for a political favorite, and they made a complaint to Number One in yahapalanaya.?
Number One who gave them an attentive hearing immediately suspended the appointment given to the junior lady.?
However, given the wrangling going on over the choice of an appointee, all indications are that the chair in Berlin will remain vacant for a further period, they say.?

Dev. Bill should have been discussed with CMs
	
State Minister of Finance, Laklshman Yapa Abeywarda today blamed the UNP for not discussing the Development (Special Provisions) Bill with the nine chief ministers and said the Bill would be redrafted and presented to the Provincial Councils before tabling it in Parliament.
He told journalists that the government should have updated the chief ministers and obtained their views before presenting the Bill to the PCs.
?If that was done, the Bill would not have been rejected by the Provincial Councils and the Government would not have been embarrassed with what happened,? he added.
The state minister said the SLFP supported the setting up of a mechanism to expedite investment, industrial development and tourism and has a help to investors to make their investments without the hassles of red tape and bureaucratize bungling.
Responding to a journalist, he said the SLFP was opposed to the the concentration of power in a single minister as it is against the concept of good governance.
He said there was a 'super minister' in the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime but ultimately the people rejected the super minister and the then government.
The minister said the government would act speedily on the bond scam soon after the COPE report was debated in Parliament next year.
"I admit to a delay in dealing with the bond scam but until Speaker Karu Jayasuriya sends the report to the Attorney General for necessary action after a debate we cannot do anything about it. We in the SLFP take the responsibility to accelerate the legal process on the bond scam," he said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

?
The second in command in yahapalanaya recently ordered the reversal of a transaction carried out by the country?s oldest state-owned bank.
?
The order had been issued following a complaint that the deal had not been carried out adhering to the stipulated rules and regulations. ?
Worried that the deal with foreign funds had been clinched at a time the government was under fire from the opposition for selling government assets one after another, the second in command had reprimanded some purohitas handling affairs related to banks and had even pulled up the head of the bourse as well, they say.
Some maintain that the big guns at the management level in the bank should take the rap for the transaction.
Meanwhile, some others assert that misinformation provided by an affluent political son- in- law in yahapalanaya is responsible for turning the transaction into a serious issue. ?However, confusion over the issue is expected to clear up soon, they say.

Ganeshan accuses Dilan, SB of batting for the JO
	
Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) Leader and Minister Mano Ganeshan today accused some government members of helping the joint opposition which is trying to sabotage the activities of the government.
He said ministers Dilan Perera and S.B. Dissanayake were siding with the joint opposition and helping the cause of the joint opposition.
?There is a reactionary group within the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) who are not with President Maithripala Sirisena or with former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and are only helping the joint opposition.
"We have formed the national government not to play around but to settle the national issue permanently. The new constitution is not to divide but to unite the country. My friend minister Dilan Perera who is a member of the steering committee knows the mood of the committee," Mr. Ganeshan said said. "The constitutional proposals are being politically misinterpreted by JO members. It is Dilan Perera's duty to express the mood existing within constitutional making steering committee. But instead his behavior indirectly helps the JO agenda. A minority-friendly Dilan should realize that JO is trying to destroy the government by propagating lies about the proposed constitution. We of the TPA want both major parties together until the arrival of the new constitution. We can part ways later if necessary. SLFP can form a UPFA government. UNP can form a UNF government. Or we can go for a snap general election. We of the TPA are ready for all options but now we stand for the protection of the national government led by the President and the Prime Minister," he added.
Minister P Thigambaram said the national government formed by the SLFP and the UNP should run its full term based on the pledges given by the President and the Prime Minister.
He said it was the duty of the government members to see that it serves the full term. ?We urge all members of the government to see that pledge made by the prime minister and the government is kept," Mr Thigambaram said. (Yohan Perera)

Govt. attempting to postpone LG polls: JO
	
The Government is attempting to postpone the Local Government election by diverting the delimitation committee report to political parties, joint opposition MP Dullas Alahapperuma said today.
He told the media that the five member committee headed by Asoka Peiris would maintain their position and make not changes to the report.
?There is no need to divert the report to political parties,? he said.
The five-member delimitation committee comprises Asoka Peiris (Chairman), Prof. P. Balasundaram Pillay, C.N.S.W. Mathew, Upul Kumarapperuma and A.S.M. Misbah.
?The JO did not make any representations to the delimitation committee. As such it is we who should request for a copy of the report to express our views,? the MP said. ?We have come to know that some politicians in this government had requested this diversion as a tactic to postpone the election.?
The delimitation committee report was to be handed over to the subject minister on Tuesday but the Tamil translation had been rejected by the committee secretary because of a technical error.
Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha had assured Parliament that the elections to the local authorities would be held soon after he received the delimitation-committee report on December 30. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

They all shared the same table and were having a friendly chat.?
?Rice prices have gone sky high. What do you say?? the former strongman asked. ?
?Yes, Sir. Eatery owners say that they have to increase the price of a meal packet at least by Rs. 10,? the provincial chief readily agreed.?
?How do you account for this sudden sharp rise in rice prices?? the former strongman asked again.
?Traders have sent stocks underground, they say, Sir!? the provincial chief replied.
?If the traders have sent stocks underground, it?s your job to unearth them. Bring out hoarded stocks!? the former strongman urged the provincial chief.
The provincial chief smiled and made no reply.?
?Ok. I?ll tell you how you can get the hidden stocks disgorged. You ask ahawala (that person) ? He will tell you??

?
A grand ceremony followed by a tournament was held in the cool climes of the central hills on the eve of the holiday season.?
?
A purohita, an artiste to boot and a lovely young star from the neighbouring country were the chief guests.?
The organizers had hired a helicopter, at a high cost, for the chief guest duo to travel comfortably to the venue of the function and back to Colombo.
The function over, the purohita had invited the comely star to dinner in a high-end hotel in the area. She had accepted the invite without unnecessary demur and the purohita left for the hotel with the young star after assuring the organizers they would leave for Colombo soon after the dinner.?
The duo had enjoyed a sumptuous dinner after saying cheers to taste the flavour of a drink or two of a kind more suited for royalty and the time spent in fun and laughter had flown without their knowledge. And it was nearly 12 hours later when they left the hotel.?
The organizers had a hard time in explaining to some people the ?disappearance? of the purohita and the lovely star, but what worried them most was the unexpected situation where they had to pocket out several hundred thousand for using the helicopter for 12 extra hours!?

?
There were recent reports that a major crisis was threatening to uproot the Tree party. Even the party?s supreme body failed in its attempts to resolve the crisis triggered by accusations levelled against party leadership itself.
?
It has now transpired that it all started when the powerful secretarial one decided to take the bull by the horns for the failure to offer him a seat in Diyawanna in terms of an agreement reached before the last?general polls.
Highly ruffled secretarial one commanding a sizable power base in the East began giving the party leader jolts one after another and the latter ? ?highly shaken by the growing opposition to him finally held out the olive branch,?they say.
So the secretarial one is going to take the Diyawanna seat vacated by a party member in January and the ousted one is to have the solace of being offered an ambassadorial post.
However, some party members say it is too early to say that crisis is over. There are smoldering cinders still lying under the ashes, they say.

Web media which carried out a major role in bringing the yahapalanaya into power has become the whipping boy of several sections of the society.
?
Government, unhappy about the conduct of this media, has now placed before its top team a proposal that calls for legislation to regulate it.?
An important and powerful political authority in the country who has taken into his heart to properly discipline the web media has already gone out of the way to get the necessary legislation beaten into shape, they say.
Some say that it is a strange quirk of fate that the political authority directly involved in drafting the legislation is none other than a member hailing from a political family holding a major stake in several media institutions.

Patrol bike issued to escort bride and groom
	
Heads of the Police Traffic Headquarters are baffled by the act of a junior officer who had permitted a powerful highway patrol motorcycle (worth Rs.3.5 million) to be used to escort a wedding car in Modera last week.
The Chief Inspector at the Traffic Police Headquarters had given permission to send a 600 cc Yamaha motorcycle -- which according to an order given by IGP Pujith Jayasundara should be solely used for highway and express way patrolling, .
Daily Mirror learns that motorcycle No. BAS 6534 had been sent to escort a car carrying the newly weds from Kotahena to Modera last Thursday (22) evening.
The motorcycle had escorted the car to the couple's wedding reception at the ?Jesu Jeewamanai? Church in Aluthmawatha Road, Modera, where President Maithripala Sirisena had been a special dignitary.
A request by one of the wedding organisers on the previous day to the Superintendent of Traffic Headquarters to issue a powerful motorcycle to escort the wedding car had been refused as it was strictly against orders.
A recent circular by the IGP had stated that such bikes should only be used for highway patrolling, and special permission should be sought from the Senior DIG if it was to be used for any other purpose, such as escorting a foreign dignitary or a religious leader.
The said CI had issued the motorcycle without such permission and caused a stir among the police top brass for defying orders.
The same officer had had to face an inquiry earlier for issuing a Police radio patrol car for a non-official purpose on his own initiative.(Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

The world?s tallest Christmas Tree built on the Galle Face Green came under flak from various quarters from the very outset.
?
The Church protested first. And it was settled with the intervention of the second in command. ?The construction work on the Tree was nearing completion when the project came under attack again. The political authority handling Christian affairs was the villain of the piece this time round, they say.
Asked about his alleged involvement in sabotaging the X-mas Tree project, this worthy had maintained that he had had nothing to do with such an attempt. And he had added: ?As a matter of fact, I have no liking for this kind of showy things. I believe only in the kind of activity that one may engage in with devotion.?
However, the actual reason behind the X-mas Tree concept as well as protests against it is linked to the ongoing cold war over the preference vote in the Gampaha district, informed sources say.
People say that any attempt either to use a religious affair or to create a controversy over such affair for the sole purpose of winning preference votes is to be deplored.

Rising price of rice/Rice miller blames minister
	
The main reason for the price of rice rising is that the Rural Economic Affairs Minister does not release the paddy stocks held by the government into the market in a systematic manner, a major rice miller said yesterday.
Mr. Dudley Sirisena, the rice miller, said that, although the President and the Prime Minister had given instructions to issue the paddy belonging to the Paddy Marketing Board, the minster had not followed the correct tender procedure and had sold the paddy to his friends and the friends of other politicians, and that they sold the paddy at exorbitant rates to the rice millers, including himself. Therefore, the rice millers had to sell the rice at high prices, he said.
He said the rice millers had stocks of Samba and Keeri Samba that would suffice till April but that there were insufficient stocks of Nadu. He said the government had a large stock of Nadu.
He said it was unfair to blame the rice mill owners for the rise in the price of rice.
He expressed these views at a media briefing, yesterday (27) at the Hilton Colombo Residences.
He said he had decided to meet the media, as a responsible rice producer and rice buyer and a person with a political background, because a large number of allegations had been made against him.
I am the main person who is blamed for the rise in the price of rice. As a responsible businessman I have to explain the situation to the public. I will fight until the authorities implement a proper programme, he said.

Taped conversation  between  Lasantha and MR  - It?s twists and turns
	
With last week?s release of a taped conversation between the Editor of The Sunday Leader Lasantha Wickrematunge and former President Mahinda Rajapakse, there has been a buzz of speculation as to who released the tape and why the tape was released at this particular time. The contents of the tape, the tone and manner of the conversation and the relationship between the two has been dissected and analysed by media pundits and the public alike but all questions are yet unanswered and the emergence of the tape remains a mystery. ??
Then, as if that wasn?t mysterious enough, this week a second tape emerged of a conversation between the two, and it mainly centred around a ?joourno hit list? sent to foreign embassies in Colombo. ??
As someone who closely associated with the assassinated journalist and thus privy to many things that went on at the time surrounding his life and work, I can say that the conversation which has been dated at May 08, 2008, was in fact the ?mending fences? or burying-the-hatchet conversation. To explain what this means, I need to go back a little in time and put things in perspective as well as reveal what Wickrematunge himself felt about his friendship with Mahinda. ?
The Editor and the former President had known each other since the late eighties. During the Presidency of Chandrika Kumaratunga, Mahinda who was a minister of that government, was certainly not one of her blue-eyed boys. In fact the two clashed quite a bit and Kumaratunga referred to Rajapakse as the ?Reporter? hinting that he leaked many government and cabinet secrets to the media, in particular Lasantha Wickrematunge. The friendship spanned many years and indeed Mahinda did provide a great deal of grist to Wickrematunge?s journalistic mill. When Rajapakse became Prime Minister in 2004, the Sunday Leader warmly congratulated him in its editorial.
Towards 2008 however, the President seemed to have had a change of heart. For whatever reason, he was keen to mend fences with Wickrematunge and directed his physician Lindsay Eliyantha White to do the needful....
However, the friendship was doomed for disaster after Wickrematunge broke the Helping Hambantota scandal in January 2005 and continued with weekly follow-ups. At the heart of the scandal was Prime Minister Rajapakse who was enraged as a result, and the one-time buddies turned enemies. ??
After Rajapakse was elected President in November of that year, the animosity between the two boiled over to a now infamous screaming match on the telephone after the President was wrongly informed by a diplomat that The Leader was most likely to be the newspaper that would carry a story regarding a visit by the President and his wife to a hallowed temple in India. ?
The two were from then on sworn enemies and The Leader continued to week after week splash investigative stories on corruption in the government. ??
Towards 2008 however, the President seemed to have had a change of heart. For whatever reason, he was keen to mend fences with Wickrematunge and directed his physician Lindsay Eliyantha White to do the needful. White was introduced to Wickrematunge by a businessman relative of White who was known to Wickrematunge. The Editor however steadfastly refused to meet the President. What the motivations of the President to mend fences or to be seen to be mending fences can only be conjectured, but Wickrematunge seems to have had some idea. ??
He said in that email, ?There is a doctor who is also a faith healer. He is part British and part Sinhala. He is Mahinda?s doctor. He is the man whom Mahinda sent to meet me through another friend saying he wants to get friendly etc. He is the one who attends to all his medical needs etc. He keeps a low profile and not many people know him or about him. He cures cancers etc. ??
Anyway I am taking some treatment from him for my pressure. He said some of my nerves on the right side of the brain was damaged leading to the pressure. The medicine involves applying some oil for three days and some kasaya and stuff. My friend ***** whose relation he is, is the person that brought him to me. I of course refused to meet Mahinda. because he can always kill me thereafter and say we were once again friends and that I had even met him....? ??
However, at some point, Wickrematunge gave in to the pressure by his businessman friend and Lindsay White to talk with the President.. The telephone conversation on the tape in question is that ?mending fences? conversation. That is the reason why there is a great deal of awkward laughter at the beginning of that call initiated by the President. ??
Wickrematunge was known to tape important telephone conversations but my guess is that this one was taped by Mahinda. Why it was leaked at this point is unknown, however it seems that with the CID team covering a great deal of ground in recent times in the Wickrematunge murder case, people are feeling the heat and keen to show the world that he and the slain editor were good friends. ??
The Wickrematunge family are adamant the tape was not released from their quarter and there is no rhyme or reason as to why anyone from his camp would release this tape, which on the contrary has only caused confusion in the minds of people with regards to this outstanding journalist and fine human being. ??

I still recall as a schoolboy, how I used to carry the ?Fourth International Flag? and march around the Maharagama-Pamunuwa area shouting slogans, together with my cousin Dr. Haris Deen (now residing in UK). ??
I was one of those ambitious youngsters who joined the famed hartal of 1953. That year, on 12th August I joined a group of demonstrators, among whom were comrades brought from Kosgama, under the leadership of Robert ?Sahodaraya.? The crowd that gathered on the High Level Road at Maharagama-Nawinna junction cut trees in protest against the Danapathi Aanduwa and blocked traffic on the road. At that time my father was employed in the Port Commission at the Colombo harbour.
He used to cycle to work from Nawinna. When the harbour workers struck work to join the hartal, my father returned home early, purchasing a honey patta from Pettah. As he reached Nawinna, a tree that was being cut fell onto my father?s new Raleigh bike, badly damaging it. Mercifully he escaped with no injury to him. The honey too trickled out of the patta, and a group of women baking ?Rotti? on the roadside were quick to collect it and savour the ?Rottis? with it chanting the slogan ?Hameed Baas Ta (my father) Jayawewa.? They enjoyed it to the extent of even ignoring the arrival of MP Robert Gunawardena on the scene.
What a difference a pot of honey could make! An eminent writer and broadcaster of that era, Mahinda Abeysundara (who produced the popular ITN ?Puwath Pasubima?) later commenting on the event, described how the ?Hameed Baas ta Jayawewa? slogan was on air for a while instead of ?Robert Sahodaraya ta Jayawewa!? ??
Sri Lanka missed the opportunity of forming a ?Govi - Kamkaru Aanduwa? of the Leftist movement. A golden opportunity missed by the working class
Despite this hype of activities by the Leftists, the Marxist philosophy and principle suffered a slide due to ideological differences that unfortunately surfaced in the thought and activity of the Sama Samaja leadership. According to prominent journalist and diplomat S. Piyasena, if it had not been for this division, the first Prime Minister of Independent Ceylon in 1947 would have been Dr. N.M. Perera of the Sama Samaja Party . A quick glance at the results of the first parliamentary elections in
Ceylon provides ample evidence supporting this observation: ??
Party Seats
United National Party - 42 ??
Lanka Sama Samaja party - 10 ??
Indian Congress - 07 ??
Lanka Tamil Congress - 07 ??
Bolshevik Sama Samajaya - 05 ??
Communist Party - 05 ??
Independent Parties - 19 ??
Of the 19 independent candidates, 11 were of left leaning. The Ceylon - Indian Congress too at that time was closely associated with the leftist movements as the Sama Samaja leadership drew inspiration from the independent struggle or Suwaraj of India ? some of the Sama Samaja leaders like N.M Perera and Philip Gunawardene were associated with the Leftistsin India when they were hibernating there evading arrest by the British rulers in Ceylon. ??
If they contested under a single banner without being divided as Trotskyite LSSP and Stalinist LSSP, the results would have been: UNP 42 and the Leftist block 45. In addition to this majority of elected members, 06 more appointed members would have made it a strong government of the progressive forces, with 51 MPs. ??
Thus, Sri Lanka missed the opportunity of forming a ?Govi - Kamkaru Aanduwa? of the Leftist movement. A golden opportunity missed by the working class to establish a government of theirs under universal suffrage. That was a sad chapter in history, in the government making process. This in cricketing parlance - ?a chance going a begging?- NM lost the crown! , purely due to a rift through a battle of ideologies between the Trotskyites and Stalinists. ??
The LSSP from its inception based its political ideology on anti-capitalism, anti-colonialism and anti-bourgeois. There were many an artful strategy adopted by this party to propagate their political activity, even when their leaders went underground. The Britishers recruited soldiers for the second world war from the countries under their colonial rule. It was the LSSP that mainly carried on a secret campaign against such arbitrary recruitment.
The LSSP leaders were under the close scrutiny of British rulers and the latter even imposed a strict ban on any type of publications by the left leaders. In order to overcome this obnoxious restriction, they distributed secretly, leaflets throughout the country, to instill patriotism among the people. At the Uramangas Handiya Junction, the LSSP branch distributed leaflets sending down inspirational messages in the form of poems. One of them was written in this manner: ??
?Harara Dilliye ??
Uramangas Handiye ??
Suddagey Yuddeta Jalliye ??
Gihilla Mariyaw Malliye? ??
?Oh our ?Mallila? (youths) do not fall in to this trap set by the colonial masters. If you want to die, then go and join the Suddhas army ..? The Sama Samajists were patriotic then and are patriotic now. They will never be a party to sell the country to any foreign powers or help divide the motherland in any form. ??
Today we are celebrating the 81st Anniversary of the LSSP. Let us learn the bitter lesson from the past history, and join to form a well-knit progressive movement under Mahinda Rajapaksa, encompassing all communities and races ? Sinhalese, Tamil, Muslim and others, to establish a strong and united government in the not too distant future. ? ?

US threat on UN, a further waning of US influence: Kohona
	
Former chief of the UN treaty section and a former permanent representative of Sri Lanka to the UN, Palitha Kohona said that the US threatening the UN with financial sanctions would only result in the further waning of US influence in the UN and globally.
?To threaten the UN with financial sanctions would only result in the further waning of US influence in the UN and globally. All countries, especially countries like the US, must continue to work together to make the world a better place,? he told IPS.
Kohona also said that the US was a key player in the creation of the UN and the organisation has served US interests well over the years.
?One might even say that the US has manipulated the UN to serve its global interests,? he argued.
Mr. Kohana said against this background, to return to the confrontational attitudes of the early 1990s, when the US withheld its dues, would be self-defeating.
He said the US was no longer the only country with overwhelming financial clout.
US president-elect Donald Trump, peeved over a Security Council resolution last week chastising Israel over its continued settlements in the occupied territories, has signalled an implicit warning he will review his relationship with the UN.
Immediately after the resolution was adopted by a vote of 14?nil, with the US abstaining, Trump held out a warning: ?As to the UN, things will be different after January 20.?
Currently, the US is the biggest single contributor accounting for 22% of the UN?s regular biennium budget, followed by Japan (9.7%), China (7.9%), Germany (6.7%) and France (4.8%) ? all based on a country?s ?capacity to pay?.
