Court bars President?s TV show
	
The District Court of Kaduwela issued an enjoining order against four television stations from broadcasting a programme titled ?Janapathi Janahamuwa? or a programme of similar nature featuring President Mahinda Rajapakse.
Issuing the enjoining order on an application filed by lawyers for the common opposition candidate Maithripala Sirisena, the District Court barred the Independent Television Network (ITN), Rupavahini, Swarnawahini and Derana from broadcasting the said show.
The lawyers for the common candidate pointed out that January 5th would be the last day for broadcasting propaganda and that if the programme, whether by the name 'Janapathi Janahamuwa' or any other name, was broadcast, the common candidate would not get similar airtime or an opportunity to reply. The enjoining orders prevent the broadcast of 'Janapathi Janahamuwa' by that name or any other name, or any other similar programme.
Lawyers for Sirisena said that the programme was sought to promote the candidacy of the incumbent President and since it was the last day for propaganda, no other candidate would be provided similar airtime.
Ronald Perera PC appeared with Suren Fernando and Nalin Amarajeewa for the Plaintiff.
President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka Upul Jayasuriya said that the decision was an encouragement to the citizens who strive for an independent judiciary. (Susitha Fernando and Hafeel Farisz)

EC warns of re-poll in case of violence
	
	Elections Commissioner Mahinda Desapriya said today election violence appeared to be increasing and warned that he would have to call for re-polling in areas where such violence continued unabated.
	He told a hurriedly summoned news conference that there was the possibility of election violence rising in the wake of the shooting incidents and attacks reported during the past few days, along with some assault cases. ?
	?I am sad that this trend of violence is increasing and is a serious form of election law violation, Mr. Deshapriya said.
	Also, he said the prevention of voters from turning up at polling stations, and the collection of their poll cards and Identity Documents??? were serious offences. He noted he had derived powers to annul the poll in such instances, from a court ruling delivered in 1990s.
	?During that period, voters were not allowed to proceed to their polling stations citing security reasons.? A fundamental right case was filed. The court ruled against officials responsible for it. There are several important court rulings that legally strengthen my hands in taking action against wrongdoers. There is fear that voters will be blocked this time.? I want to allay such fears. I have powers to act in such instances against anyone trying to block voters,? he said.
	Mr. Desapriya said only the police personnel would be assigned for election related duties.
	?I am sure the military will not be involved in any duty at this election. The Inspector General of Police has assured me his fullest co-operation. Only, the police officers in uniform can carry firearms??? within the premises of polling stations. Security officers, accompanying political leaders, are now allowed into polling stations,? he said.? (Kelum Bandara)

Kurunegala Bishop plans to resign
	
	The Anglican Bishop of Kurunegala, the Rt. Revd. Shantha Francis said today that he would resign from his position as he, being a Tamil, was under pressure?? from Tamil Diaspora groups to toe their line.
	Addressing a press conference he said he had always stood for a unitary state and the sovereignty of Sri Lanka and, therefore, had earned the wrath of these groups.? He said he had been threatened by them during his visit to London last month.
	?I value and stand for the unitary state and sovereignty of the country. I came under pressure from the Diaspora groups due to my position in this regard despite being a Tamil priest.? They asked me why I had taken up such a position instead of speaking for the rights of minorities. I have two options ? to resign from my priesthood or to embrace their agenda.? I will stick to my position. That is to appear for the unitary state and sovereignty of the?? country. This is what we have achieved after 30 years of war. I will quit my position as the Bishop of the Kurunegala Diocese to serve the interests of the country,? he said.
	Asked whether he would take to politics, he said he would not side with any political party but rather serve the interests of the common people.
	He said he was constantly threatened by Tamil Diaspora groups living elsewhere in the world.
	?I received threatening letters in London. I faced this problem during the latter half of last month,? he said.
	Also, he said he had spoken against the swindling of Rs.138 million at a leading school in Kandy.
	?I spoke about it with the school principal and the old boys. But I was threatened and told to stop,? he said. (Kelum Bandara and Sanath Desmond)

I will win by huge margin: Mahinda
	
	While expressing confidence that he would win Thursday?s Presidential Election by a huge margin, President Mahinda Rajapaksa said yesterday that he would dedicate his third term for the future generation and make Sri Lanka a prosperous, safe and beautiful country for the unborn Sri Lankan child.?
Addressing the final election propaganda rally at Kesbewa today the President said he came to Kesbewa after touring the North, East, South and the Central provinces and by the massive crowds that gathered in thousands at UPFA propaganda rallies he was fully confident that he would win the Presidential Election by a huge margin.
President Rajapaksa lamented saying that Common Opposition candidate Maithrpala Sirisena was set to sell the free education in the country by pledging to create a loan scheme for GCE A/L students who failed to enter University to study further.?
He pointed out that the Common Opposition manifesto had pledged on page 41 in his manifesto to launch a bank loan scheme for GCE A/L students who failed to enter the university to continue studies further was meant to destroy free education.?
??This is a covert scheme aimed at charging students from kindergarten level. The manifesto also pledges to re-organize the state administration in line of the Tamasec system in Singapore in order to increase efficiency and productivity in the public sector. But we can still remember that how Chandrika planned to privatize about 40 state ventures and Ranil another 40 which I saved later,? President Rajapaksa said.
He said important state ventures like SriLankan Airlines, Pelawatta and Sevanagala Sugar Factories and Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation had been privatized under this scheme which later took over by the government under his leadership.
President Rajapaksa pointed out that former President Chandrika Kumaratunga had sold valuable prime lands in Battaramulla as cheap as Rs. 200 a acre to Ronny Peiris and he re-sold it to Sumal Perera. However, the court after an inquiry abolished the deal and fined Mrs. Kumaratunga as it was a national fraud. The regime under Ranil had decided to prune the public service to 300,000 from 700,000 saying it was a burden to the Treasury but the UPFA government under him has now increased the public service to 1.4 million as the government does not think the public service a burden to the government.
Outlining the development achieved in education under the UPFA government President Rajapaksa said plans were afoot to construct 1,000 Mahindodaya science labs, new technology labs and several University Colleges and also to enroll 100,000 students to universities.?
The government has launched the Port City project by reclaiming the sea and creating thousands of employment opportunities. Those mega development projects had been launched without incurring a cent to the Sri Lankan government, he said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Brito Fernando said the severed dog head was hanging in his gate last night.
?Last night, I along with my daughter and my wife went out for dinner around 7.00 pm and got back home at 10.30 pm. By the time we got back I saw three shopping bags hanging in the gate. At first I thought that it is a bag of garbage but when I inspected, I saw something similar to ears of a dog. Since both my wife and daughter were scared I let it be. In the morning when I looked, I found out it was a severed neck of a dog. It looked fresh as the blood was there,? he said.
Fernando said he lodged a complaint with the Negombo Police Station.

	In the event President Mahinda Rajapaksa wins Thursday?s election, legal action will be taken against foreign agencies and individuals who allegedly funded the common opposition election campaign and induced government members to join the opposition, Minister Dulles Alahapperuma said.
	He told the Government?s final news briefing today that the government had identified ?three foreign hands? and certain foreign intelligence arms involved in helping the opposition candidate to win the elections. ?They will be exposed and punished,? the minister said.
	He said the Government had made a mistake during President Rajapaksa?s second term by failing to take action against those who had reportedly given money and weapons to the LTTE and helped it to kill the country?s political leaders.
	The minister said the conspiracies against the Government had been discussed and hatched in Singapore by foreign and local agents and the government was in possession of video evidence to prove it.
	?Opposition attempts to highlight a culture of violence in the run-up to the presidential election to convince voters that the Government has a hand in the attacks is a myth. We have statistics to show that this election is one of the most peaceful elections ever with only 314 complaints being received by police stations up to today. Most of them were minor incidents like the pulling down of banners and tearing of posters,? he said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
