Finance Ministry angers MS
	
President Maithripala Sirisena is reported to be perturbed over the Finance Ministry allegedly placing conditions for the allocation he sought for development work in the Polonnaruwa district.
The President submitted a Cabinet paper seeking financial allocations to execute the development projects in the district.
However, it is learnt that the Finance Ministry has reportedly made some reservations about the President's paper. In its observations, the Ministry has even asked for tender procedure to be followed in carrying out work in the district.
The President, apparently angered over the Ministry, conveyed his displeasure at the Cabinet meeting on Wednesday.
Referring to the award of contract to construct the first phase of the central expressway without calling for tenders, the President sarcastically asked for permission from the Ministry for his work in the same fashion, it is learnt. (Kelum Bandara)

Laws to control Buddhist monks will fail: BBS
	
	The activities of certain monks who support political leaders seeking benefits have a negative impact on the entire Buddhist mission, BBS General Secretary Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera said today.
	We are facing these problems because of not taking the right decision at the right time, a point which has not been understood by our political leaders, the Ven. Thera said.
	As a Buddhist organisation we urged the government to establish a commission to identify anti-Buddhist activities. Unfortunately, the government is not concerned about our request, he said.
	However the Government is planning to bring an Act in the Parliament which can take the control of the activities of Buddhist monks. We will not let the Act to be brought to the parliament. Ordinary people cannot put conditions on the clergy. If rules are to be implemented they should be proposed by the Chief Sangha Nayaka, the Thera said.
	We have so many invasive forces in the country which are against Buddhism. But it seems even the Mahanayakas are silent on these matters. Thats why we need a Sanghadikaranaya - a special court to hear cases of Buddhist monks. Its high time that we do away with these worn out British laws, the Prelate said.
	This measure proposed by the government will only draw the attention of Sinhala Buddhists to a different path without allowing them to concentrate on the development of the country, the Thera said.
	If the laws are to be implemented they should be made according to Buddhist Laws and regulations. Not according to the laws of the white colonialists.
	From now onwards, we will not present ourselves before any court or magistrate until we are called before a Sanghadikaranaya. We respect the countrys law, but we are not going to bow before the white mans law unless it is relevant to our country. We request all Buddhist monks to boycott the courts of this country. If the government fails to call for a Sanghadikaranaya we will break the civil law. Then the government has to convert every coconut tree into a gallows and every school into a prison to suppress the Sinhala Buddhist people.
	So do not try to put your hands on the heart of the Buddha Sasanaya, the Prelate warned. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Reconciliation vital for economic growth: Hugo
	
Visiting Britains Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Hugo Swire has said reconciliation would be key to Sri Lanka future economic growth.
It is reconciliation that will, I believe, be the bedrock on which Sri Lankas future economic success will be built," State Minister Hugo Swire told a business forum in Colombo today.
"That is why, in recognition of these commitments  and following talks between Prime Minister David Cameron and President Sirisena at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Malta in December - we were delighted to announce the provision of 6.6 million pounds of UK Government funding to support peace and reconciliation in Sri Lanka," he added.
Swire pointed out that one vital aspect of reconciliation and economic development and a growing area of cooperation between the UK and Sri Lanka is tackling corruption.The full speech as follows,
Remarks for Council of British Business (CBB) Honourable Deputy Minister Wickramaratne, Mr Shirendra Lawrence, Chairman of the Council for Business with Britain; Ladies and Gentlemen.
It is an honour to address such a distinguished audience and I thank you for your warm welcome. I am delighted to be back in Sri Lanka. And I want to take this opportunity to share my thoughts on the exciting prospects for this country  and for the political and economic ties between Sri Lanka and the United Kingdom.
What a difference a year makes! Since the election of President Sirisena last January, there has been a distinct and welcome change of atmosphere in the bilateral relationship between our two countries.
I was delighted to be the first overseas Minister to visit Sri Lanka following the Presidential elections. And our ties have gone from strength to strength  most notably when President Sirisena met Her Majesty The Queen and Prime Minister
David Cameron in London in March.
And I think this improvement in relations is largely down to the positive developments we have seen in Sri Lanka over this remarkable year. For me, perhaps the most significant of these developments were the commitments Sri Lanka made at the Human Rights Council in September. Those commitments to take meaningful steps towards truth and accountability after the long conflict here are key to bringing about lasting reconciliation.
And that is important because it is reconciliation that will, I believe, be the bedrock on which Sri Lankas future economic success will be built.
That is why, in recognition of these commitments  and following talks between Prime Minister David Cameron and President Sirisena at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Malta in December - we were delighted to announce the provision of 6.6 million pounds of UK Government funding to support peace and reconciliation in Sri Lanka. 
Incidentally, let me also mention another significant announcement coming out of that meeting - the appointment of a non-Resident UK Defence Adviser. Historically, our bilateral military relations have been very close and I know that the resumption of cooperation and collaboration in this field is very welcome by the armed forces of both our countries.
I will be going to the North tomorrow with the President and Sri Lankan Prime Minister Wickremesinghe to participate in National Thai Pongal celebrations.
Celebrations that have even more powerful meaning at this time of new beginnings for Sri Lanka. And while there, I also look forward to meeting resettled families, members of civil society and religious leaders to hear directly from them about the progress in reconciliation and economic development.
One vital aspect of reconciliation and economic development  and a growing area of cooperation between the UK and Sri Lanka - is tackling corruption. This was, of course, a key election promise of President Sirisena. And answering his request for international assistance, the UK is providing anti-corruption training and anti-bribery expertise to the Sri Lankan authorities. 
Why are we doing that Because the elimination of corruption improves business confidence, not only for the existing business community, but it also helps make Sri Lanka a destination of choice for new foreign direct investment. 
That is good for the UK, as well as for Sri Lanka - because building our prosperity through increasing exports and investment; opening markets; ensuring access to resources; and promoting sustainable global growth is a key element of the UK Governments long term economic plan - and a cornerstone our foreign policy.
The latest figures released in December show the UK economy continued to grow strongly, with GDP in Q3 increasing 2.1% on a year ago. The unemployment rate fell to 5.2%, the lowest rate in nearly ten years, while average wages and productivity measured by hour worked continued to grow.
However, both our countries cannot afford to be complacent.
We are only two weeks into the New Year, and already weve had worrying news about stock market falls around the world, the slowdown in China, deep problems in Brazil and in Russia.
Commodity prices have fallen very significantly.
Oil, which was over $120 a barrel in 2012, dipped below $35 earlier this week.
That is good for consumers and business customers both in Britain and Sri Lanka, but bad news for the oil and gas industry, worrying for the creditors who have lent to it, and a massive problem for the countries that depend on it.
And all of it adds to the volatility and sense of uncertainty in the world.
However, through its actions, the government of Sri Lanka has sent a very clear message to the international community across the world that it is open for business from all corners of the globe. Attracting Foreign Direct Investment is I know a top priority for the Government as it seeks to strengthen the Sri Lankan economy and put Sri Lanka in a stronger position to deal with the global challenges both our countries face.
And I am pleased to report that the past year has been a very busy one for the High Commission Trade and Investment team. With their support, British companies are now competing for around 1 billion of business across a range of sectors. We are hopeful that many will be successful in a transparent and accountable competitive bidding process. 
I was also pleased that the Lord Mayor of the City of London visited in May. Many of you may have met him while he was here, promoting the City of London as a hub of global financial excellence - and fostering closer links with the Colombo Stock
The UK also continues to be among the top 10 investors in Sri Lanka and I am delighted that around 150 companies in Sri Lanka with a UK affiliation currently operate here. I hope and expect that that those numbers will continue to rise.
On exports, the UK is Sri Lankas third largest market, with exports in 2014 growing a remarkable 36%, to well over 1 billion. While British exports to Sri Lanka were only 165 million in the same year, we have made reducing that trade gap a priority - and the latest figures show UK exports to Sri Lanka increased by nearly 50% last. But while this is all good progress, we are not resting on our laurels. Next week, for example, the High Commission is hosting a Food is GREAT event - highlighting the excellence of British food and drink.
And I hope you have secured your tickets for the Marco Pierre White Gala dinner, to taste the finest produce from all over the UK. 
Sadly I shall not be there but I am sure the High Commissioner will enjoy telling me what I missed.
After that, the team here will be hosting a multi-sectoral trade mission in February to further bolster our bilateral trading links. 
I will end there, and take some questions in a moment, but to summarise: it is clear from the steps that Sri Lankas government has taken so far that it is serious about delivering on the commitments it has made on accountability and reconciliation.
Addressing problems from the past will create the right conditions for greater prosperity in the future.
It is equally clear that the administration is serious about tackling corruption and attracting the investment it needs to deliver long-term, sustainable growth.
The British Government is proud to help in any way we can. And I am pleased that British businesses are contributing to Sri Lankas success. I am confident that when I next visit I will hear about more British companies winning business and doing business here I am in no doubt that this will be thanks, in no small part, to the valuable work of the Council for Business with Britain. Shirendra, thank you for all the help and support you give to the High Commission in its trade promotion activities.
By working together, the Council and the British and Sri Lankan governments are making great strides in bringing security and prosperity to the people of Sri Lanka, of the United Kingdom and of the wider world.
So I am of the firm view that the prospects for our shared future are indeed bright.
And all of us here can help turn those prospects into reality.

	Allegations had been made against the principals of ten popular schools in Colombo and the outstations, and they are to be investigated by the Ministry of Education, said a senior official of the ministry.
	He said the main charges against them were that they had admitted children to their schools in violation of the ministry's circulars, and collected money illegally from parents and pupils. He said that audits were being carried out in the schools and disciplinary action would be taken if the audits proved that the principals were guilty of offences.
	Preliminary investigations had shown that additional classes had been conducted without the approval of the ministry, and money had been collected from parents on the pretext that it was required for the construction of new buildings and the provision of facilities. (Ranjan Kasthuri)

US to conduct thorough inquiry says Rajitha
	
	The US Federal Reserve in Washington DC, has given an undertaking to Sri Lanka that it would conduct a thorough inquiry on the illegal dollar deposits of Sri Lankans and provide all information with the amount hoarded and the names of account holders, Cabinet spokesman and Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
	He told the weekly cabinet news briefing yesterday that the government had information that three persons close to the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime had deposited nearly US$ 3 billion in banks in Dubai and Ukraine.
	One, a member of the Rajapaksa family has allegedly deposited US$ 1.086 billion, another person closely related to the former first family has deposited US$ 1.8 billion and a powerful Secretary and a former chairman of a leading state establishment has deposited US$ 500 million according to information we have access to, Minister Senaratne said.
	Responding to a journalist on the delay in apprehending and prosecuting those who have allegedly amassed ill lucre in foreign banks, Minister Senaratne said it will take a few more months for the US Federal Reserve to give Sri Lankan government a detailed report on alleged money laundering.
	It will happen for sure. But the problem is the US Central Bank receives hundreds if not thousands of similar complaints from all over the world daily. Therefore, it takes time. But it has responded positively to our request as the US Federal Reserve monitor each and every dollar it prints and in circulation all over the world, he stressed. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
