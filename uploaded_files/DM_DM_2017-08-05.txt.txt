Bangladesh graft hotline gets 75,000 calls in first week
	

DAILY MAIL, 4 AUGUST, 2017 - Bangladeshs new anti-graft hotline has been overwhelmed with tens of thousands of calls about acts of corruption in its first week, an official said Thursday.

Hotline number 106 was launched last Thursday by state authorities in an effort to crack down on graft in Bangladesh, which has been listed by a global watchdog as one of the worlds most corrupt nations. 
Since July 27 around 75,000 people called our hotline, Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) spokesman Pranab Kumar Bhattacharya told AFP. 
The commission is empowered to investigate bribes in government offices and agencies, misappropriation of state assets or money, embezzlement of state funds, amassing of wealth through illegal means, money laundering and bank fraud. Local English daily The New Age said most complaints were against land record offices, followed by utility services, state-run hospitals,
government-run schools and railway and road transport authorities.

China warns Indian troops to get out of contested region
	

BLOOMBERG, 04th AUGUST, 2017 - Beijing is intensifying its warnings to Indian troops to get out of a contested region high in the Himalayas where China, India and Bhutan meet, saying China has been restrained but restraint has its limits.
India says its troops entered the area in the Doklam Plateau in June after its ally Bhutan complained a Chinese military construction party was building a road inside Bhutans territory. Beijing says the dispute has nothing to do with India, and has demanded that Indian troops

CMA challenge lawsuits to define loud noise
	
The Ceylon Motorcyclists' Association (CMA) yesterday questioned the Police Department as to how they define loud noise which causes public nuisance and how they gauged such a noise.
Speaking to Daily Mirror CMA Secretary Chirantha Amarasinghe said the association had noticed a sudden increase in the laws regarding loud machinery which the police categorized as a public nuisance.
Amarasinghe said the police had no way of measuring the level of sounds in machines without a Sound Level Meter (SLM), especially in modified vehicles.
He also stated that the public nuisance where vehicles were concerned were only for horns, a law which was yet to fully implemented.
Motorists were often fined as much as Rs. 100,000 for the sound of modified vehicles and for the fact that the original structure of the vehicle was changed despite performance accessories and modification parts being freely available in the market.
It is not a crime to import these parts in to the country. The government is charging taxes when importing these parts and the customers also pay a tax when they purchase the items. But suddenly it has become a crime to use these body kits for the vehicles, he said.
Amarasinghe said though the vehicles were fined for the high noise, the police often filed cases in court for motorists changing the original structure of the vehicle. This was done in to ensure they were not inconvenienced in court.
The police should not fine motorists for one thing and write something else in the charge sheet, he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

His future linked to solving national question: Sampanthan
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes political future and the future of the country largely depend on resolving the national question and bringing about economic development, Opposition Leader R Sampanthan said.
He said this during the ceremony in Parliament to felicitate Prime Minister Ranil Wickrmesinghe's 40 years as a parliamentarian.
Premier by nature is calm and stable person and a person who cannot be ruffled easily. We are felicitating him on his outstanding achievement of being 40 years in Parliament but the concern is his future. He and President Maithripala Sirisena should work together to come up with a political solution to the national question, Mr. Sampanthan said.
Economic development and the national question are closely associated. Much needed economic development could be achieved only if the national question is resolved, he said. (Yohan Perera)

PCoI to rule on legal issues raised by lawyers
	
The Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) yesterday considered giving certain appropriate orders pursuant to a few legal issues raised by lawyers appearing for Central Bank's former governor Arjun Mahendran, PTL owner Arjun Aloysius and PTL CEO Kasun Palisena.
Presidents Counsel Kalinga Indatissa appearing for Mr. Palisena drew attention to the legal powers vested in the commission to call for material belonging to individuals for investigation. He said the PCoI had no power to do so under the provisions contained in the mentioned Acts.
He also questioned the legality of the engagement of the officials at Attorney Generals Department in the bond sale inquiry, because it was not a normal court of law.
There was another legal issue raised by Counsel Chanaka de Silva, who appeared for Mr. Mahendran on whether a representative should be allowed when experts extract information from the devices handed over to the Commission.
However, there was an issue of what was the best practice in such instance in the criminal justice process. ASG Yasantha Kodagoda submitting some international references said there was no practice of allowing outsiders when experts extract information from case productions.
The Commission also allowed Mr. Mahendran's counsel to submit his stance on the matter and subsequently reserved the order.
Meanwhile, Presidents Counsel Anuja Premaratne who appeared for Arjun Aloysius requested the commission to furnish a copy of the all matters extracted from his clients phone.
ASG Kodagoda drew the Commissions attention to the fact that the extraction of the data was not completed because they were facing the difficulties in the absence of the Apple phone password.
The PCoI said the copies would be made available no sooner the extraction of the required information was completed. ASG Dappula de Livera said they were still at the initial stages of investigating whatever was extracted.
Raising objections on the extracted details presented on August 2, in relation to Mr. Aloysius mobile phone, Mr de Silva said the manner in which such details were presented when Minister Ravi Karunanayake was testifying.
However, the Commission was of the view that the details relating to Mr. Aloysius phone were subject be proved and if parties mentioned in those details denied them then the Attorney Generals Department had to prove its credibility.
ASG de Livera said the authenticity of the details has to be proven and that is why the messages extracted from Mr. Aloysius' phone in reference to RK and Ravi K were presented to the Minster the other day.
The ASG said if the Minister had accepted them then the authenticity of the extraction would have been proved. He said they will prove the credibility of the details in due course.
The Commission yesterday also ascertained that it had given a two fold order earlier over Aloysius apple account.
The order says, that the Commission is not satisfied that the provisions of the Commission of Inquiry Act no.17 1948 provides to issue an order prohibiting Mr. Aloysius from accessing his apple ID or apple account, since they are personal property of the individual and therefore the Commission should give due regard to the right of a person to access his property.
However, the order says the position is different with regard to the second request made by ASG Yasantha Kodagoda, which is to prohibit Mr. Aloysius from tampering with or altering the data in the apple account.
The Commission was of the view that the mobile phone belonging to Mr. Aloysius was duly produced to the Commission and now it is in its custody. On that circumstance the commission has a power to ensure an item in the custody of the Commission is not tampered with or altered because the data in the apple account is integral to the mobile.
Thereby the order issued on August 3 was delivered only prohibiting Mr. Aloysius from tampering with or altering in any manner, the data in that apple account, and prohibiting his agents or others acting on his behalf from doing so.
Referring the provisions of sections 201 of chapter XI of the penal Code read with section 9 of the Commission Act, the Commission had mentioned that any act which could make causing destruction or rendering illegible such data before the Commission would be an offence punishable with a term of imprisonment.
Thereby, the commission had warned Mr. Aloysius over any act on his part which attempts to or commit may result in the commission of an offence and consequently it may result of taking appropriate criminal proceedings against him (Shehan Chamika Silva)

President Maithripala Sirisena has asked Foreign Affairs Minister and former finance minister Ravi Karunanayake to resign from his portfolio in the face of the allegations levelled against him in connection with the Central Bank bond sale, government sources said yesterday.
They said the President had told the minister that if he continued to function as a Cabinet minister, it would create serious issues not only to the government but also to the minister himself and as such the President had pointed out that the best solution available to the minister is to resign from his ministerial portfolio.
President Sirisena is reported to have conveyed this to the minister during a dinner held on Thursday night at Temple Trees to celebrate Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's completion of 40 years as a Member of Parliament.
Minister Karunanayake was also summoned to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) to testify with regard to the evidence submitted to it. (Ajantha Kumara Agalakada)

SL cricket runs by bad people,ICC should go after them:Arjuna
	
Even as the current crop of Sri Lankan cricketers struggle against India in the ongoing Test series, former captain Arjuna Ranatunga has lashed out at the current administration, saying that the sport in the country is being run by people with 'bad reputation' and the ICC should go after such people instead of going after small players, News 18 reported.
During an exclusive chat with News18, Ranatunga said that he would write to Sri Lanka's Prime Minister soon and seek government intervention to improve the standards of the game in the country.
"I don't want to watch Sri Lankan cricket anymore because the people who are running it are bad people. Their family business is gambling. If such people administer Cricket, what will happen to the game All of us know what happens. The ICC should go after such people instead of going after small players. I request the ICC. Sri Lankan Cricket is in a bad shape because of people with bad reputation running it. It can't go on like this forever," Ranatunga said during a telephonic conversation.
It was under Ranatunga's captaincy that Sri Lanka stunned the world by winning the 1996 World Cup and started their journey to becoming a powerhouse in international cricket. Currently a cabinet minister of Petroleum and National Development, Ranatunga is ready to provide his service to clean up the current mess.
"I have nothing against them. They are my boys. They are good. They need a good guidance and clean administration. I am concerned about the future of cricket and cricketers".
"If the President and Prime Minister want me to head an interim board, I will do that. I will offer my services. I can clean it up," the former chairman of Sri Lanka Cricket said.
Ranatunga, who played 93 Tests scoring 5,105 runs, and 269 ODIs accumulating 7,456 runs, recently told a Sri Lankan daily that cricketers and cricket administrators were more worried about earnings, foreign trips and perks rather than commitment of winning for the country.

The Churchs one foundation: the word of God
	

Sri Lankas cream of singing voices gathered from leading Christian school choirs and sang in unison of Gods wonder in the presence of over 1,500 at the Cathedral of Christ the Living Saviour for a worthy cause-the Education Fund for the less privileged children.
Raising their voices, feeling the presence of Jesus Christ with feel of the Holy Spirit, feel for one another, feel of compassion, feel of spiritual love and the feel of oneness, the youngsters and the not so young, poured out of their hearts to the wondrous conducting of the popular De Lanerolle brother, who spared no pain to make it a success.
They were joined by Organists Dr. Jonathan Clarke (London) Neranjan de Silva (Sri Lanka) and Battista Prada (Italy) as Orchestra Conductor.
In between the programme, the Vicar of the Cathedral, Ven. Perry Brohier made a brief appearance to thank and praise the magnanimity of all who thronged to make the event a great success. He thanked all for their dedication and commitment.
After the heavenly strains died down and a sense of spirituality prevailed, the Lord Bishop of Colombo Rt. Rev. Delo Canagasaby wound up the evenings praise to the Lord, when everyone sat to listen in
pin-drop silence.
In his usual style delivered with simplicity and clarity, the Bishop emphasised on the unfinished Word of God.
Step by step he led us on the unfinished journey towards its spiritual meaning and when ready to complete his mission, he said:-
This church represents the symbol of God and therein lies His deliverance, His word. This is where he abides until he is ready for our ultimate salvation and when the time is right, it will be wholesome. No danger, no fear within but as strong as his word: Beautiful Home he has prepared for all his followers, all Christians: As his children we have to have faith in his word.
Many times when I worshipped at the Cathedral, my eyes strayed around the massive structure of the church, so imposing in all grandeur and architecture. Strong and steadfast but not complete and why the church is not putting to right where it matters: The dripping and dried cement flow from its columns, the need of plaster in many places, the dome half opened to the sky and many more
unfinished work.
The more I looked at them, the more puzzled I became, but forgot the issue when I Left the church. Did the church have no money to complete it And the Bishop had the answer.
Then it dawned on me as I listened to our shepherd when he spoke of the unfinished work of God like our church, the walls though strong, have to wait. They represent and remind us of our long wait for salvation until He is ready.
That evening I got the answer of the incomplete church that had puzzled me. Bishop Canagasaby is the Father, the gentle and genial shepherd to all Christians no matter to what Christian sect one belongs as he look upon one and all with infinite, undivided love for all as well as for non- Christians in trouble, who seek compassion and strong and sturdy as his , this towering Cathedral where God abides.

How great Thou Art
De Lanerolle Brothers
O Lord my God , when I in awesome wonder,
Consider all the worlds thy hand have made,
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,
Thy power throughout the universe displayed:
Choir 
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to thee
How great thou art,
Great thou art
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to thee
How great thou art,
How great thou art.

Vital to fast track reconciliation and economic development: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday stressed the need to speed up the process of finding a political solution to the national question and the development of the economy.
He said this during the vote of felicitation to mark his 40 years as a parliamentarian.
The two main factors we have to focus are on securing permanent peace and economic development and it is essential to speed up our effort to achieve these objectives, the Premier said and added that the two main parties should work together for this purpose.
World politics was based on Europe during the time I joined politics but today the region that is emerging is Asia and we Sri Lankans should understand this situation, he said.
Mr Wickremesinghe earlier highlighted the major political events during the last 40 years.
I was initially elected to the National Assembly in 1997 and the present Parliament complex was built in the middle of an island. We witnessed the 1983 riots, an impeachment motion being brought against a president, the assassination of a president, the assassination of an opposition leader, the end of a war and the jailing of a candidate who contested the presidential elections. This was the kind of political arena I have been working in during the past 40 years, he said. One thing I learnt during my career is that one must take to heart the advise given by one's elders and the value of learning from experience. As an experienced politician the advice I can give is that one should maintain discipline and gracefully accept both victory and defeat.
He thanked his family, the former Presidents J R Jayawardene, R. Premadasa and former ministers Lalith Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayake for positively influencing his career. (Yohan Perera)

We appreciate PM's good qualities: Nimal Siripala
	
Differences between the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) are not an obstacle for to appreciate Prime Minister Ranil Wickremeisnghe's good qualities, SLFP Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva told Parliament yesterday.
He said this when the motion of felicitation was taken up in the House to mark Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes 40th year in Parliament last morning.
The line of thinking of SLFP including its economic policy defers from the UNP but that does not stop the SLFP from appreciating the Premier Wickremesinghe's good qualities, the minister said.
He said the SLFP would not hesitate to felicitate others in Parliament as and when they reach millstones in their political careers like the premier.
SLFP has been battling with the UNP since 1977 and had been criticizing Premier Wickremsinghe many times but he had taken these criticisms in good spirit. Many of us have been treated with smiles when we come to the lobby after criticizing him during our speeches inside the chambers. I have seen with my own eyes the maturity shown by Mr Wickremeisnghe when dealing with foreign delegates, the minister said. (Yohan Perera)

Will Sri Lanka be able to challenge the Indians
	


It would have been more gracious had the entire selection committee decided to call it a day at the end of the Zimbabwe tour, leaving room for a new set of selectors to be appointed for the Indian tour, because it is the responsibility of not only the captain or the Chairman of selectors but also the entire selection committee.

The Sri Lanka cricket team suffered one of its worst defeats against India in the first Test played in Galle, a venue where the Sri Lankans normally dictate terms to the opposition.
With this defeat, one wonders whether the Sri Lankan team will be able to get anywhere near the world number one test team India, during this tour.
Taking a closer look at Sri Lanka Cricket, it looked like the administration was falling into disarray with the appointment of White Lightning Allan Donald to be in charge of the Sri Lankan fast bowlers and 1996 World Cup winning team batting star, Asanka Gurusinha, as Cricket Manager, on their tour to England for the ICC Champions Trophy.

Things did not go according to plan and with the series on par at all. Accusations were directed at a player manager, who incidentally was in charge of the captain, for influencing the selectors.


Part of this prompted the former Sri Lankan batting great Aravinda de Silva to move out of Sri Lanka Cricket. While in England, former skipper Angelo Mathews made himself available to lead Sri Lanka in the first Champions Trophy match against South Africa but was not allowed to do so by the teams management.
Had Mathews played, with Sri Lanka at 116 for 3 in 18 overs, and joined Upul Tharanga at the crease, things could have changed and we might have got the better of South Africa.
However, the Sri Lankans did well to beat India where the captain showed his class, and even though they lost to Pakistan due to poor fielding and had to bow out of the tournament, the Sri Lankan team had not done badly.
At the end of the tournament the Sri Lankan coach, whom Sri Lanka cricket had managed to recruit just 18 months ago, tendered his resignation for reasons best known to SLC officials.
Meanwhile, the Minister of Sports decided to publicly state that the players should improve their fitness standards if they wanted to play for Sri Lanka in the future, if not the team would not be ratified by him. One of the Vice Presidents of Sri Lanka Cricket has decided to keep away from all functions and it is rumoured that he has decided to call it quits.

Fingers were pointed at the selectors, the cricket manager and the captain. Two of our former captains, Mahela Jayawardena and Arjuna Ranatunga went on record to question the selectors...

This has been kept as a State secret, while the other Vice President is busy conducting investigations on the match-fixing scandal which took place during a Premier Tournament game.
There was some doubt about whether the selectors, whose terms were ending on June 30 would get an extension.
However, the Minister after getting some valuable input decided to extend their term until 31st December 2017.
With the arrival of the Zimbabwe team, one expected Sri Lanka to win the One Day Series with a clear margin.
However, things did not go according to plan and with the series on par at all. Accusations were directed at a player manager, who incidentally was in charge of the captain, for influencing the selectors.
This was flatly denied by the Chairman of Selectors. More accusations were thrown in public such as the ill fated Pakistan Tour in 2009 and the 2011 World Cup Final, which did not help to lift the morale of the players before the all-important final one-dayer which Sri Lanka lost.
Fingers were pointed at the selectors, the cricket manager and the captain. Two of our former captains, Mahela Jayawardena and Arjuna Ranatunga went on record to question the selectors by asking why the two best spinners did not play together to win matches and the series. The chairman and the cricket manager had different explanations which made us understand that their plans had to be put on hold after Sri Lanka lost the first match.
The captain, on the other hand, safeguarded his self-respect and the team by gracefully accepting responsibility for the defeat before submitting his resignation from all three formats of the game.
It would have been more gracious had the entire selection committee decided to call it a day at the end of the Zimbabwe tour, leaving room for a new set of Selectors to be appointed for the Indian tour, because it is the responsibility of not only the captain or the Chairman of selectors but also the entire selection committee.
One wonders at the end of the Indian tour whether the two present captains would submit their resignations and the selectors will still hold on to their reins.
In a recent TV show it was revealed that Sri Lanka Cricket employs nearly fifty well qualified coaches, who I presume, are well paid for their coaching assignments.
The future of Sri Lanka Cricket can be rosy if all these coaches can produce at least one quality cricketer each, whereas in time to come Sri Lanka will have a significant number of good cricketers. But the million dollar question is whether they can do it.
The Minister of Sports agreed to carry out an investigation on the 2009 Pakistan Tour and the 2011 World Cup Final which seems to be put on hold due to the Indian tour.
I wonder whether he has decided to open a can of worms. Yes, the cricket crazy public are keen to know what had taken place behind closed doors, but is this the right time to do so Or is it a ploy to divert our attention from cricket being played like politics in this country
Furthermore, the 1996 World Cup winning Captain Arjuna Ranatunga went on to state, that if given the opportunity he would bring Sri Lanka Cricket its due recognition before the next World Cup in 2019.
I wonder if he is aware that eleven of his fourteen comrades  including the skipper himself, with the exception of Roshan Mahanama, Muttiah Muralidharan and Kumar Dharmasena, that went on tour for the World Cup has had stints with Sri Lanka Cricket but failed to deliver what was expected of them.
With this backdrop, it will be interesting to see whether the Sri Lankan cricketers will be able to stand up to the challenge put in by the Indian cricket team who are already on our shores playing exciting cricket.
It is advisable for all of us toput all this on the back of our minds and hope the selectors will put up the best available teams for each and every game, and the team management will boost the confidence of the players.
The cricket crazy fans will rally round our Test captain Dinesh Chandimal, One Day and T20 Captain Upul Tharanga and support the boys to up their game, play the best cricket and give us something to cheer about.
