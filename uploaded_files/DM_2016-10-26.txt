The second round of talks is due to be held at the official residence of the secretarial one from Rajarata. However, the flamboyant one from Badulla who is said to be sulking over being reduced to state status has already predicted that the peace moves are destined to endin smoke.
Meanwhile, some sources say that the good lady does not want yahapalanaya in shambles at a time her son is to make his much- talked-about debut on the national political scene.

Rupee weaker on importer dollar demand; stocks up
	
REUTERS: The Sri Lankan rupee edged down yesterday due to importer dollar demand and a lack of exporter sales, but selling of the greenback by a state bank capped further fall in the domestic currency, dealers said.
They added the moral suasion by the Central Bank discouraged trading in the spot currency market.
Rupee forwards were active, with the spot-next trading at 148.05/15 per dollar, weaker than its previous close of 147.95/148.05.
The spot rupee was quoted at 146.90/95 per dollar, but there were hardly any trades.
The (importer dollar) demand is there and the rupee is under pressure as there are not much of inflows, a currency dealer said, asking not to be named.
A state bank was seen selling dollars, but we are not sure if it was on the instructions of Central Bank or it was selling its
own positions.
The spot rupee is usually managed by the central bank, and market participants use the forward market levels for guidance on the currency. Officials from the Central Bank were not available for comment.
Dealers also said foreign selling in government securities also put pressure on the currency. Foreign investors sold Rs.8.79 billion ($59.84 million) worth of government securities in the week ended October 19, data from the Central Bank showed.
Dealers said the market was waiting for some direction from the national budget due on November 10. Sri Lankan shares trading firmer, with the benchmark Colombo stock index 0.2 percent firmer at 6,431.28 as of 0630 GMT. Turnover stood at
Rs.49.9 million.

Separate lane for buses from December: Gemunu
	
The Megapolis and Western Region Development Minister had approved the separate lane for buses during peak hours from Battaramulla to Colombo Fort from December 1, Lanka Private Bus Owners Association Chairman (LPBOA) Gemunu Wijeyaratne said yesterday.
While addressing a media briefing yesterday, he said the request that he had made to the relevant authorities long time ago and it had now become a reality.
We had discussed this separate bus lane issue with the Megapolis Minister and it had been decided to come in to operation from December first week, he said.
We decided to use low flow buses. While using low flow buses we hope many people will get used to it instead using their own vehicles and thereby minimise the road traffic.
Unfortunately, the new bus lane had not been approved on the expressways. But Minister Ranawaka had intervened to provide us with a good solution. We are thankful to the Minister and now we could see there is a Minister who can really get the work done, Mr. Wijerathne said.
There are lots of government institutions situated in Battaramulla and those institutions can request buses for their transport services.
Those allocated transport services will be operated with half the normal fare for the government employees, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Shares recover from 12-week low in dull trading
	
REUTERS: Sri Lankan shares edged up yesterday from a 12-week closing low hit in the previous session, but trading volume slumped to a more than 2-1/2-year low as investors awaited cues from the government budget and five-year plan as well as corporate earnings.
Sri Lankas quarterly earnings season started two weeks ago, but most of the firms listed locally reports in late October or early November. The national budget is scheduled to be presented on Nov. 10.
The benchmark index of the Colombo Stock Exchange ended 0.29 percent or 18.63 points higher at 6,436.97, edging up from Mondays close of 6,418.34, its lowest since August 1. The index fell 0.54 percent last week, its second straight weekly loss.
Tuesdays turnover was Rs.135.9 million, its lowest since March 17, 2014 and lower than a fifth of this years daily average of around Rs.736.2 million.
It was a very dull day. Its a waiting game now and nothing is happening, said Dimantha Mathew, Head of research at First Capital Equities (Pvt) Ltd.
The equity market is dead and all are waiting for the governments five-year plan and the budget.
Stockbrokers said the market was also digesting political concerns over the resignation of the head of Sri Lankas anti-corruption body on October 17, a few days after President Maithripala Sirisena implied that the agency was favouring the rival party of his Prime Minister.
This is likely to delay one of the promises of Sirisenas coalition government, eliminating corruption, and could hurt business confidence, analysts said.
Foreign investors bought a net Rs.17.6 million worth of equities, in the eleventh straight session of net foreign inflows and bringing the total net inflows to RS.1.23 billion over that period.
They have sold a net RS.1.74 billion worth of shares this year. Shares in Ceylon Tobacco Company rose 2 percent, while Carson Cumberbatch rose 1.65 percent.

To sell wild elephants to fill the depleted state coffers!
	
A number of political and white collar bigwigs in the country had participated in a high level conference held recently at an office handling the responsibility for countrys public finance.
The participants were putting their thick heads together to discover new ways and means of increasing the revenue for the public coffers.
Political authorities presiding over public finance and the international trade were among the pundits present at the conference.
At the outset, a participant presented a proposal to fell trees on state-owned lands for timber for sale. He pointed out that that they could raise an income of about Rs. 4 billion from this exercise. This proposal was accepted with none raising any objection to it.
Thereafter, a big-made top team member announced his revenue-generating proposal. There is another source of income as lucrative as logging. There is a good demand for elephants. Why dont we capture a good number of wild elephants for sale While making wild elephants a good source of income for public coffers, we will be able to meet the demand for elephants for peraheras and above everything, we will be able to ease the human -elephant conflict to a great extent. Dont we hear practically every day a story or two about wild elephants raiding some village or other in the backwoods of the country and destroying the crops of poor peasants and killing people Once we implement this proposal, there will be no need to spend public funds on erecting electric fences either. So we can kill several birds with one stone
All participants greeted this proposal with loud guffaws. The purohita who stared angrily at the visibly amused participants kept quiet making no further effort to justify his proposal.

Trinco oil tanks issue still unresolved despite Indian envoys visit
	
Despite the visit of the Indian Foreign Secretary S. Jaishankar accompanied by a high-level team from the Indian Oil Corporation over the weekend, differences between the Lanka IOC (LIOC) and the government of Sri Lanka over the Trincomalee oil storage tanks persist, the New Indian Express reported today.
Sources told Express on Tuesday that the basic technical and legal issues which have been preventing the full use of the giant oil tanks remain unresolved though the tanks were handed over to the LIOC, a subsidiary of IOC, way back in 2002 for joint development with the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC).
Because of the war in North-East Sri Lanka, LIOC and CPC could not develop the tanks as desired though the LIOC, PRIMA and the Sri Lanka Air Force were using some. The LIOC had renovated 15 of the 99 tanks at a cost of US$ 15 million and was ready to invest US$ 17 more for further refurbishment. The PRIMA wheat company and the Air Force were using four.
The end of the war in 2009 did not being any relief as relations between India and the Mahinda Rajapaksa government deteriorated over the Tamil issue. In 2013, India abstained from supporting Sri Lanka in the UN Human Rights Council, and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh did not attend the Commonwealth summit held in Colombo.
Given the downturn in relations, the Rajapaksa government unofficially said in 2013, that it might ask the LIOC to quit because the original agreement was not entered into in a proper manner and that the land on which the tanks stood had not been handed over to LIOC legally. And the CPC had no authority to give permission to the LIOC to use the tanks because the CPC did not own the tank farm, which was government property. LIOC was also paying only a nominal fee for the use of the tanks.
However, the government of India unofficially warned Sri Lanka that the IOC-CPC deal was the result of the India-Sri Lanka Accord of 1987 and was a government to government agreement which cannot be unilaterally abrogated. The Sri Lankan government thereafter stopped talking of a takeover but full development of the tanks did not proceed as originally envisaged.
But India was keen on participating in the energy sector in Sri Lanka and had an eye on Trincomalee for development as an Indian Ocean energy hub. 
The tank farm consisting of 99 tanks is located on an 850-acre block of land. Each of the tanks has a holding capacity of 12,100 metric tons of oil. The total storage capacity is about one million metric tines.
After the change of government in Sri Lanka in January 2015, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe took the proposed an India-Sri Lanka joint venture to develop 30 storage tanks in the first phase. The Government proposes to establish a new venture between Lanka IOC and the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) to develop the 84 tanks located within the Trincomalee Upper Tank Farm. However, the resoration will cost a lot of money.
The Minister of Petroleum, Chandima Weerakkody, told Parliament that CPC had said that nine could be used after minor repairs. The government wants to increase the total storage capacity to 90,000 MT, enabling it to benefit from the global oil price fluctuations.
However, technical and legal issues relating to the on-going joint venture with the LIOC still persist preventing the implementation of plans of the governments of India and Sri Lanka. (New Indian Express)

VAT Bill passed
	
The Value Added Tax (VAT) which received public criticism will now come into force, as Parliament passed the legislation with a comfortable majority today.
The Valued Added Tax (Amendment) Bill was taken up for debate in the House after the Supreme Court determined that its provisions were consistent with the Constitution.
After a lengthy debate involving arguments and counter arguments it was put to the vote -- as the Joint Opposition called for a division by name.
It was passed with 112 votes for and 46 against during the second reading. 65 MPs were absent during the vote. As per the procedure, it was referred to the committee stage for the incorporation of amendments.
Joint Opposition MP Bandula Gunawardane moved an amendment calling for the exemption of health services from VAT. Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake declined to accept it saying VAT would be imposed only on medical consultation fees and in-house hospital charges. He said he would issue the necessary regulations under the bill later.
During the third reading, a division was called for again. At that time, there were 76 votes for it and 23 against. The rest of the members who had voted during the second reading had left the chamber by that time.
Along with the Joint Opposition, the JVP also voted against the Bill. However, the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) which is the main Opposition party was absent during the vote. The Joint Opposition MPs were seen wearing black bands around their necks or on their arms as a mark of protest against the VAT hike.
Minister Karunanayake said 81 goods and services would be exempt from VAT. He said some opposition members had created a misconception. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)

Aged woman locked in poultry shed
	
An eighty four year old woman who had been locked up in a poultry shed behind a house in Wanni Kudawewa, in Kudawewa was found by the Galgamuwa Police yesterday. Police had taken her daughter into custody on suspicion.
The woman had been locked up in an abandoned poultry shed about twenty feet away from the suspect's house. When police raided the place they had found the woman seated on a plastic chair, a police spokesperson said. Police sources said that the thatched roof of the poultry shed had decayed and plastic sheets had been laid over them. The poultry shed was constructed of iron mesh. The woman had also been compelled to use the shed as a lavatory: as a result the place had a nauseating smell.
The daughter had admitted that she chained her mother at night to prevent her from wandering about and falling. Police had also found a bed without a mattress or pillows as the aged woman was hunchbacked and could not straighten her back. The daughter had told the police that her mother had been given medical treatment twenty years ago. The daughter was residing in a house with four rooms and a tiled roof.
The police had straightaway admitted the woman, N.M.H. Umma, to the Galgamuwa base hospital. The daughter was taken into custody on suspicion and is to be produced in court. (Nihal Jayaweera)

Bank of Ceylon offers an account for everyone during Thrift Week
	
Along with the government initiatives for financial inclusion, Bank of Ceylon has brought forward Samata Ginumak initiative to open an account for unbanked Sri Lankans to become bankable through thrift/saving among them during this
Thrift Week.

The Bank promotes accounts for non account holders in the country by making the initial deposit from BOC to encourage every citizen to maintain a bank account and save. As a state Bank we are carrying out this campaign in line with the Government policy and initiated the program Samata Ginumak during the thrift week,  said  Deputy General Manager Sales and Channel Management Senarath Bandara. BOC boasts of over 1200 customer touch points that includes the recently added CDM Network to give a unique modern day digital banking experience to all our customers, Bandara further added.

COPE will present a landmark report: Ajith P. Perera
	
The Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) would present a landmark report which will hold all those responsible for the alleged bond scam culpable and call for their arrest, said Deputy Minister and COPE member Ajith P Perera at a media briefing last evening.
He said the report would hold the owners and directors and others responsible for the scam, and call for their arrest.
Asked whether former Central Bank governor Arjuna Mahendran would not be held responsible, Mr Perera told journalists to wait till Thursday and find out. "Do you want all the news today" he asked, when they questioned him.
He said the United National Party (UNP) MPs only wanted to see that the COPE report did not leave any loopholes in the event of a court case.
The draft report prepared by Mr. Handunnetti only states that there is evidence to suggest that the Central Bank governor had been involved in the scam. This is far from satisfactory, as it should have named the offenders," he said.
"It was we who suggested that Perpetual Treasuries should be held responsible, and that its directors should be arrested," he said.
He refuted the allegation that the UNP MPs had threatened the Auditor General, and said the MPs had had a cordial discussion with him. "We agreed with the Auditor General's statement that he did not have a mandate to do certain things," he said.
He denied that COPE chief Sunil Handunnetti had decided keep away temporarily. We all place our trust in Mr. Handunnetti," he said. (Yohan Perera and Kelum Bandara)

GSP+: Committee to look into Muslim Marriage, Divorce Act
	
A committee had been appointed to consider reforms to the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act to the norms stipulated in international conventions, Cabinet Co-Spokesman Gayantha Karunathilaka said today.
He said as some provisions in the Muslim Law, including the minimum age of marriage, were not in conform with the norms stipulated in international conventions, which Sri Lanka was holding membership, and that it was necessary to amend those provisions.
While addressing the media Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake said the country had to obey the international conventions as in a situation like preparing to get the GSP +.
Amending of the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act is also a part of international protocol, which is a requirement to obtain GSP +, he said.

His influence has failed this time round
	
A certain political authority with ties to sports has begun feeling unhappy and uncomfortable in yahapalanaya, they say.
By the way, the politico once said that he felt a strong inclination to function as an independent member in the council.
Some government high ups who had made discreet inquiries as to why this sporty one had suddenly gone sulky, have stumbled upon the cause: a ladylove of our man has been making an easy buck through the lucrative printing contract and the political authority handling the public purse has now made a move to award this contract to another person.
Fireworks are expected to break out in the august assembly shortly over this affair, informed ones say.

Korean investor did not come back for the 45th time
	
Disposal of the city garbage has now reached national crisis proportions.
While the residents of Meetotamulla are demanding that the garbage heap there be removed without further delay, people in Ja-ela area are up in arms against a reported move to dump the city garbage on an already identified site there.
Amid these agitations, a leading Korean entrepreneur who visited this country looking for an investment opportunity, made preparations with a local business partner to launch a multi-purpose garbage re-cycling project which included a bio-gas-fired power plant.
Later, the Korean investor who had to go through a miles-long procedure to obtain official approval for the project had failed to receive the necessary co-operation from some of the state agencies involved. Finally, he had met the countrys highest political authority along with the local partner and placed their case before him.
The highest authority who gave an attentive ear to them, immediately summoned all political and white collar authorities involved with the subject for a discussion and instructed them to extend their support to the foreign investor and his local partner.
The Korean investor took advantage of this meeting to explain the hardship he had to undergo in trying to get his project off the ground. He told the countrys highest authority that he was visiting the country for the 44th time in connection with the proposed project and hoped that he would get the assistance from all authorities concerned to get his project going without any further undue delay. 
The highest authority who listened to the travails that the foreigner had to undergo ordered all political and white collar big guns not to disappoint the investor this time round.
The Korean investor and his local partner inspired by the encouraging words of the countrys highest authority went round with renewed vigor to clear the hurdles in their way. But alas! They discovered after two months of going from pillar to post they were still at square one. Following discreet inquiries made about the failure on the part of the authorities to expedite procedural formalities, they learnt that a top team member in yahapalanaya handling affairs related to international trade had upset the apple cart.
A highly dejected Korean investor finally left the country having decided not or return here for the 45th time.
By the way, the Korean entrepreneur is said to be now in Bangladesh busy ploughing his monies into some projects launched in that country.

Kudos withheld because his bona fides were suspect!
	
Highly elated over the hard-hitting SLFI speech by the Big Boss, a  group of JO stalwarts had got ready to issue a media statement showering their praise on him.
However, another faction of the JO had expressed misgivings about the genuineness of the sentiments expressed by the Big Boss. And this had led to a clash of opinion within the JO, informed sources say. The talkative one from Nawalapitiya and young Ramesh from Galle were among the JO members who wanted to issue a statement hailing the speech. However, a large majority in the JO had referred to the controversial speech as just another episode from the drama being enacted by the Big Boss and as a result, the proposal to hail the speech had taken a backseat.
Both factions had later consulted the former strongman who is now leading the JO group. Dont be in a hurry to commend the speech, had been his advice.

Making a turnaround for political survival!
	
A certain newly appointed chief purohita who had been a virulent critic of the former strongman and the JO has of late begun playing a different political tune, they say.
This chief wielding administrative powers over a comparatively prosperous province has a strong reason to re-set his political battle lines.
The majority of the Betel leaf members in this council are supporters of the former strongman and his survival in the main chair depends on their support. Meanwhile, these pro-JO members had warned the chief purohita that they were prepared to teach him the same lesson as the one taught to a purohita in another council some time ago if he continued to criticize the former strongman or the JO. Struck by the fear of losing his coveted office, the chief purohita has not only stopped criticizing the former strongman, but has gone so far as to talk about the possibility of forming a government under his leadership, they say.

NFF brandishes unofficial COPE Report
	
National Freedom Front MP and COPE member Weerakumara Dissanayake yesterday claimed he would release a report, which would hold all those responsible for the alleged bond scam if the official COPE Report was not released this week.
Addressing a media briefing, Mr. Dissanayake said that he would no longer follow the ethics of Parliament and the Committee On Public Enterprises (COPE) from next week if the COPE Report is not released in Parliament.
All information regarding the controversial alleged bond scam in the Central Bank (CB) had been gathered and it is clear who should be held responsible. The COPE Report was to be released in Parliament last Tuesday, but it was purposely avoided by several parties, he added.
Mr. Dissanayake said if the COPE Report would not be released this week it would be postponed till next January according to Parliament schedule.
He said the bigwigs, who were involved in the alleged scam, had hired State officials to conceal the large scale thievery and added that the NFF would not let them to conceal it any longer.
Fortunately, the Joint Opposition members were privileged to take up this issue in Parliament. But the majority of the COPE members are in favour of former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran, and they are not concerned about the country, he said.
He said the responsibility of the COPE members was just to question on matters that were risk to the countrys economy and added that they were now doing its opposite by safeguarding Mr. Mahendran. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Nobody pushed AG to change his findings: Harsha
	
Deputy Minister Harsha De Silva posting a comment on his Facebook account yesterday said that at no time did any of the members of COPE push the Auditor General to change his findings.
The full post follows:
Notwithstanding the practice of not speaking on matters of COPE until its report is submitted, an exception has to be made, after all what has gone on these last few days.
By staying quiet we were subject to all kinds of wild allegations by those who spoke to the press. I heard tonight that on some TV channels it had been reported we misused our 'power' in the committee to get the Auditor General (AG) to change his recommendations. For the record, yes we discussed and debated several technical issues and recorded matters of disagreement, and sought clarity by asking him several times to add one more sentence to his report to clarify a certain important point, but at no time did any of the members push the AG to change his findings. (Today I spoke to him and he agreed with me that no such thing happened between us.)
Generally, the accusation was the 'UNP members' were hell bent on saying nothing wrong had happened.
The truth is far from it. We, the 'UNP members' agreed with every one of the 14 observations of the AG. We did not agree with all his recommendations in the way they were presented but we went much further than those who got up and left (members of the JO and JVP and some from UPFA) with our own recommendations. It is unfortunate that the usually flexible Chairman didn't stay through to the end.
Now this story in the Daily Mirror is based on the first recommendation made by us; not by those who got up and left. We are the ones who went through para by para and discussed in committee the entire draft with the AG with the honest intention of getting to the bottom of this issue. Not those who used the COPE purely to make political statements.
While I don't plan to go in to technical details of the investigation, one thing I must divulge is that the Central Bank had violated it's own mandate on issuing bonds since January 2009 all the way up to January 2015. Just as nothing during that era was ever investigated this violation too was ignored. Lot more details will come out in the final report.
Await the remaining recommendations dealing with the other characters involved in this matter including the Governor and other senior officials when we meet on Thursday to finalise the report.
Best if we don't make our minds too early based on partial and biased information. I will certainly stand for the truth. That means to do the right thing; not to please anyone or harm anyone for political ends but be just and fair.

Now they can play both games
	
A Bill on Sports was drafted in the recent past incorporating provisions that disqualify politicians from holding high office in the recognized sports associations in the country.
Meanwhile, perturbed over the new provisions in the draft Bill, some interested parties made representations to the powers that be saying that if the new law were enacted it would cause much disappointment and grief to a certain big name associated with sports and a politico taking an abiding interest in the gentlemens game. Taking pity on the duo facing exile from the sports world, the powers that be had requested the authorities involved to suitably amend the draft.
Now that a rider has been added to the grief-causing provisions saying that the ban is not applicable to those politicians who had actively participated in sports, two to three politicians  all willow wielders of yester year  are walking on air these days, they say.

One cope report including dissenting views: Sujeewa
	
Member of the Parliamentary oversight committee COPE, and State Minister of International Trade Sujeewa Semasinghe Senasinghe said there would be only one COPE Report, which would be presented to Parliament by COPE Chairman Sunil Handunetti, with the comments of different or dissenting views of a number of other members.
He admitted that there was an issue of Conflict of Interest, if and when one of the primary dealers, Perpetual Treasuries, among 17 other dealers registered with the Central Bank, had earned an unusual and un-proportional profit in the bond market because this particular company was managed by the son-in-law of former CB Governor Arjuna Mahendran.
State Minister Senasinghe addressing the weekly Cabinet news briefing at the Parliament complex said yesterday the UNP in anyway did not attempt to save any individual or establishment involved in the bond scam or sweep it under the carpet.
But the objective was to go to the bottom of the scandal and tell the public the absolute truth on the issue, COPE member and State Minister of International Trade Sujeewa Semasinghe said.
There will be only one COPE report and we try our best to submit it to Parliament within this week. There are no dissenting reports as suggested by certain media and the Joint Opposition. The FCID, CID and the Bribery Commission are free to open a formal inquiry, if the COPE Report incriminated any individual or establishment over the bond issue and huge profits recorded by the Perpetual Treasuries in such a short period of time. We support fully such an action, he added. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
