A chat with fathers critic  !
	

The sons of the former strongman along with several buddies visited the book fair in the city the other day. The first stall the Diyawanna son was to visit was that of his Sinhala language teacher. And he bought a book and got it autographed by the teacher. He spent some time at this stall recalling humorous incidents dating back to his school days and sharing jokes with his buddies.
The next stall the Diyawanna son was to visit with his buddies was that of the varsity don, who once fought shoulder to shoulder with the late Maduluwawe Sobhita Maha Thera to usher in a Just Society.
The varsity don warmly welcomed the Diyawanna son of the political leader, who was the main target of attack of the movement he spearheaded along with the late Thera in its heyday and holding his hand said:

Looking back, I feel theres justification for certain things your father had done!
Thereafter, he launched a scathing attack on certain political leaders and some of the charges he made are too sensitive to put into print, they say.

Akila comes to Parliament by motorbike due to heavy traffic
	
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said he had to come to parliament on a motorbike in the rain yesterday afternoon due to the heavy traffic along Parliament Road.
He requested the speaker to formulate a mechanism to find a solution to the traffic congestion as they had to face difficulty in attending parliament every day.
I had three questions to answer yesterday. I left my residence in Colombo at 12 noon to reach parliament but I was stuck in a traffic more than an hour. I got on to a motorbike travelling on the road from Rajagiriya and came in the rain, he complained. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Bargaining has begun  !
	
King Rooster from the upcountry plantations domain had recently called on Number One in yahapalanaya.
Given the speculation rife in political circles these days that a major change in the Government is in the offing, King rooster had considered it was the ideal time for him to press for a place in the top team when a new set was to take over the new administration.
He had reportedly appealed to the Number One to consider the role played by his great ancestor in successive regimes in the past and concede to him the due niche in the new set up following the precedent set by the latters illustrious predecessors.
The Number One, who had reportedly given an attentive ear to King Rooster, had told him that the change which was going to take place was to be a minor one which did not necessitate forming new political links. Shaken by this reply the man had said: Be it minor or major, please remember we too wish to be part of it!

Champika introduces economic package to face economic crisis
	
While introducing an economic package to face the current economic crisis, Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) General Secretary, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Champika Ranawaka said the crisis could be turned into a blessing and could be overcome if the proposals could be adopted.
Addressing a press conference held at the JHU head office yesterday he made this remark.
In order to rescue the depreciating rupee Minister Ranawaka said that the Countrys exports should be doubled.
There are free trade zones every corner of the country. But there are no investors to invest on those. Without just implementing free trade zones for each village, we must create strong zones based on new innovations, he said.
Minister also said that there are around two million Lankans living abroad and if the Government can request them to invest in Sri Lanka USD 1,000 each there will be no trade deficit.
He also said the capacity of the ports and the airports had been exceeded therefore they should be expanded in order to earn more dollars.
He further said that those who earn dollars from exports should be given special concessions for their imports.
Minister Ranawaka said that measures should be taken to prevent concealing income from imports and exports by over and under invoicing,
He proposed that the investors bringing over USD 100 million should also give special concessions under steady tax policy in order to encourage them more.
Minister also said that he was the first who shot the warning fire on todays economic crisis in June 2016 and the same crisis could be a blessing if we work according to the proposed economic package.
He requested the President and the Prime Minister to give priority to these proposals in order to overcome the situation. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Conference on renewable secure power systems
	
The Round Table Conference 2018, organised by the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Moratuwa, will be held on October 12 under the theme Renewable Integrated Secure Power System for Sri Lanka : Challenges and Solutions at Jasmine Conference Hall at the BMICH in Colombo. 
With the purpose of highlighting the critical and contemporary issues in the Sri Lankan Power Sector, the round table conference is a panel discussion organised annually by the Department of Electrical Engineering through the Electrical Engineering Society (EESoc), its prominent social arm. This years Round Table Conference is the 18th panel discussion in the history of EESoc. State Minister of Power and Renewable Energy, Ajith P. Perera has been invited as the Chief Guest of the event while the discussion will be moderated by Dr. Tilak Siyambalapitiya, Managing Director of Resource Management Associates (Pvt) Ltd. The panellists of the discussion will be Prof. John Fletcher (Head of Power and Energy Systems, University of New South Wales, Australia), Dr. B.M.S. Batagoda (Secretary, Ministry of Power and Renewable energy), Dr. Narendra de Silva (Head of Engineering, Lanka Electricity Company (Pvt) Ltd), Dr. H. M. Wijekoon Banda (Chief Engineer, Transmission Planning Division, Ceylon Electricity Board), Eng. Champika Periyapperuma (Director  Technical Regen Renewables (Pvt) Ltd) and Eng. Harsha Wickramasinghe (Deputy Director General  Operations, Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority). The Department of Electrical Engineering is one of the oldest and key departments in the Faculty of Engineering of University of Moratuwa and it closely deals with the Sri Lankan power sector with many leaders from power utilities coming from its studentship.
Department and industry
EESoc acts as a place for aspiring electrical engineers of the department to develop their personalities and to interact with the industry to enhance their skills and social awareness. It also acts as a place for the undergraduates to showcase their talents and abilities. Collaborating with multiple entities in the field of electrical engineering, EESoc acts to bridge the gap between the department and the industry.

The annual flagship event Round Table Conference provides a unique podium for academics and industry experts to unfold remarks on a prevailing issue which has a relevance to the power sector of Sri Lanka. A panel of professionals examines and exchanges views on a matter impartially to deliver explanations and solutions to all stakeholders. Since the power sector is one holding great importance for the nation and is decisive to many other sectors, the concerned parties are large and diverse. As it is a field which is core to the national economy and its fast growth, a platform such as this is critical to Sri Lanka.
The energy scenario of the world is strongly tied with politics and the future of the world. This is because of the role it plays in the world economy, with fast depleting reserves and environmental impacts. Fossil fuel and natural gas resources hold a higher priority in power industry worldwide.
Hydro power
Sri Lanka is a country highly dependent on hydro power. Despite this, possible sites for hydro power implementation are being saturated and cannot meet the growing energy demands.The macro-scale implementation of renewable energy in the national power sector is a debatable issue, due to practical and technical constraints. 
With current trends in the world, nuclear power will be a possible solution. Yet, is it a feasible solution for a country like ours Sri Lanka receives an abundant supply of free solar radiation year round. How far can we utilize solar energy to fulfil our demand with its present technical limitations Even though there is considerable wind energy potential in Sri Lanka, are we harvesting the maximum How should the distribution network and consumer behaviour change according to possible changes These are some of the timely issues that need to be addressed and Round Table Conference 2018 is taking extensive steps towards that. 
Sunpower Renewables (Pvt) Ltd has partnered as the Diamond sponsor and LTL Holdings (Pvt) Ltd as the Gold sponsor. LECO, ACL Cables and NSB have joined hands as Silver sponsors while IDP Sri Lanka is a bronze sponsor.

Disappearing Muthurajawela Another case of doing before thinking
	

Colombo is surrounded by wetlands which not only add some colour to its pale concrete landscape, but serves multiple purposes in terms of protecting its citizens from natural disasters. One of the wetlands in the country and situated 19 kms off North of Colombo is Muthurajawela which is identified as the most important wetland with its contribution to controlling floods. However, over the past few years Muthurajawela has been filled and used to the point that its 6300 hectare expanse of land has now been reduced to 3068 hectares. On top of that, it also turns out that the Government is eyeing its only buffer zone, imposing greater threats to the overall ecosystem on the long-run. In its run-up to install as many power plants as possible, the next bait seems to be Muthurajawela for all the valid reasons which from an environmental perspective seem invalid. Hence the Daily Mirror sheds light on the current status of Muthurajawela, the proposed LNG power plant and the importance of protecting this wetland.

Environmentalists concerned over 110 acres of protected area being de-gazetted and the proposal to setup a LNG power plant
The Deputy Minister of Environment and Mahaweli Development held two meetings and in both it was suggested that this particular area will be taken for the project in the national interest
HEMANTHA JAYASINGHE


Therefore the purpose of the buffer zone was to insulate the protected area up to a certain degree. But in the filledup area everything from heavy industries was allowed while in the buffer zone several low intensity activities were allowed
JAGATH GUNAWARDENA


Now this area is outside the buffer zone, so it doesnt have any impact. There are groups who are trying to stop us from moving forward with these projects. So far we have had to stop 11 such projects due to various interferences
DR BATAGODA


The project 
As one of the most important ecosystems in the country, Muthurajawela boasts of a rich biodiversity spanning across 6300 hectares of land. According to a study done by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Muthurajawela consists of 209 species of animals along with 194 species of trees, 40 species of fish, 31 species of reptiles, 102 species of birds and 48 species of butterflies. In addition to that 18 out of 22 mangrove species could also be found at the Muthurajawela wetland. However the Daily Mirror learns that with adverse developmental projects the entire area has now been reduced to 3068 hectares of land. Out of this area, 1777 hectares of land has been demarcated as a wildlife sanctuary. Environmental enthusiasts opine that measures should be taken to protect it. But despite such attempts, the Ministry of Power and Energy recently took steps to de-gazette a 110 acre area of land for a proposed LNG power plant. This would in turn affect the fisheries and the tourism industries which have sought potential within the area. While the President himself has taken up the responsibility to be the subject minister, it is quite appalling to find out that he himself has given the green light for this project. 

The main urban wetland in Sri Lanka 
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Convener of Rainforest Protectors Sri Lanka (RFPSL) Jayantha Wijesinghe said that the Ministry of Power and Energy had declared an extent of 110 acres for this proposed LNG power plant project. Filling the Muthurajawela protected area is already illegal and its not a justification to set up a power plant. Any wetland, whether filled illegally or whether its a private land that they have claimed ownership over, cannot have an industrial operation running. Even Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) which are being done dont have reliable information. LNG is better than coal, but we are pushing the Government to implement several renewable power generation projects which are pending. Muthurajawela is the main urban wetland in Sri Lanka. Recently there were claims that Colombo has been nominated as a Ramsar Focal Point when its wetlands are getting filled up almost every day. It is appalling to find that the so-called experts and academics do not see the bigger picture. We will have to restrict the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agenda. At the Paris Agreement we setup compliance strategies. But setting up an LNG power plant is against the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) discussed at the Paris Agreement. The Ministry of Power and Energy should focus on solar and wind energy. 

UTHURAJAWELAHAS NOW BEEN REDUCED TO 3068 HECTARES


Wijesinghe further said that wetlands such as Bellanwila/Attidiya, Kotte/Beddagana, Bolgoda/Karadiyana and Diyawannawa/Thalangama need to be protected. Applying for RAMSAR doesnt look at the history of the wetland. I see that the Government is greenwashing the problems at hand by blindly going for such nominations. Urban wetlands are an absolute necessity in terms of flood regulation. They control the ground water table. Muthurajawela is the main place that charges the ground water table. Only 1777 acres are being protected by the Flora and Fauna Protection Ordinance, but there are no demarcations done as yet. Therefore theres no monitoring nor regulation being done, said Wijesinghe. 


110 acres of protected area de-gazetted 
Airing his views regarding this issue, Director General of the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) Hemantha Jayasinghe said that Cabinet approval was submitted through the Ministry of Power and Energy to release 110 acres of land from Muthurajawela. This was from the environmentally protected area. The Deputy Minister of Environment and Mahaweli Development held two meetings and in both it was suggested that this particular area will be taken for the project in the national interest. The justification came about with the fact that the energy load was identified in and around Colombo and the LNG power plant should be in the vicinity of Colombo. Therefore if taken further away the transmission lines would have to be upgraded and there could be a loss. Hence, Muthurajawela was the best option for them. According to them, in order to fulfill the future energy requirement, the country needed more power plants. Therefore as the CEA we had to consider and then the President himself intervened with his powers and the area was de-gazetted. But we had an issue in moving forward without an EIA. So far they havent decided who the contractor would be, but the site selection has been made. We are concerned about the EIA and if it fails we would not allow them to go ahead with the project. But in the long-run we are identifying the areas that need to be protected and will be demarcating a wildlife zone. This will be done in compliance with the FFPO, said Jayasinghe. 

Identification as a LNG park 
When contacted Secretary to the Ministry of Power and Energy, Dr. B.M.S Batagoda said that the said area had already been identified as an LNG park. It has the West Coast Power Plant on one side, the Litro Gas  gas filling terminal on the other and a sand-filling point owned by the SLLRDC. The buffer zone has already been filled and the entire site is used for developmental purposes. Now this area is outside the buffer zone, so it doesnt have any impact. There are groups who are trying to stop us from moving forward with these projects. So far we have had to stop 11 such projects due to various interferences. said Batagoda.


MUTHURAJAWELA CONSISTS OF 209 SPECIES OF ANIMALS ALONG WITH 194 SPECIES OF TREES


Bad precedent 
Airing his concerns, senior environmental lawyer Jagath Gunawardena said that the story starts with the Muthurajawela Master Plan where they decided that a certain area would be reclaimed and developed while another area would be declared as a wildlife sanctuary to help the lagoon to thrive as a fisheries area. It was also done for the sake of wildlife protection and flood prevention. In between the filled-up area and the sanctuary a buffer zone was declared, so that it would reduce the human impacts on the protected area. Therefore the purpose of the buffer zone was to insulate the protected area up to a certain degree. But in the filled-up area everything from heavy industries was allowed while in the buffer zone several low intensity activities were allowed. At that time the buffer zone could have been declared only under one law which is the National Environment Act under the provision of Section 22c to declare it as an environmental protection area. This was very positive when compared to other laws that conditions could be decided depending on the situation. The conditions are given under Section 24 d which provides for modifications according to the needs and sensitivities of the particular system. Here certain activities were permitted while others were prohibited. said Gunawardena. 
So many years after the declaration we find that this area is well-preserved because it is somewhat looked after by the CEA, he continued. The developed area is filled with factories and other industries. In the context of the present day, in comparison to the period when it was first designated, the necessity of the buffer zone has become an absolute necessity in view of all the development and other activities that have taken place. Here suddenly we find out that one portion of this buffer zone will be declared as outside the buffer zone and they are going to setup an LNG power plant. The LNG plant may or may not have an effect on the surrounding areas. But firstly they need to conduct an EIA and find out whether this area is suitable for this project and what mitigation measures need to be taken. But before they wanted this area to be taken out, the Ministry of Power and Energy should have tentatively earmarked this area and done an EIA report before getting it from the other end. What they are doing now is that they have identified the land, de-gazetted it, gotten the President to lay the foundation stone and then they conduct the EIA. They should have checked for other possible land before arriving here. Then they could have negotiated with the environmental authority and presented a compromised solution. As a compromise they should have done an EIA  an EIA is done to identify the localities where less environmental harm could occur, and if there was no solution they should have selected the land in the national interest, Gunawardena added. 

ENVIRONMENTAL ENTHUSIASTS OPINE THAT MEASURES SHOULD BE TAKEN TO PROTECT IT

He further said that in the present context, the Ministry of Environment, the CEA, the Wildlife Conservation Department and the President himself as the Environment Minister are in a rather embarrassing position because of the short-sightedness of certain bureaucrats and officials.
This act is creating a bad precedent because most of the time when an area is declared as a buffer zone and protected as the environmental protection area, in most instances the authority has maintained the position that no one can go beyond the permitted uses. But because of this incident, if there are people who are big enough to throw their weight about they can even cut off parts of the protected area totally disregarding the needs of this area to maintain the ecological balance and other situations. The officials havent checked the status of the land ; firstly the Master Plan and they havent made inquiries from the relevant ministries. If the relevant ministries havent provided the relevant information then they too should be held accountable. Im quite unhappy about the fact that the Ministry of Mahaweli Developement and Environment didnt come forward stating that this is a protected area because in that case the President would never have given the green light for such projects. On the other hand they should have sought other areas rather than look at their convenience  in other words they are going against a sustainable concept. Hence the above concerns need further probing. said Gunawardena.

Drunk couple buy Sri Lankan hotel while on honeymoon
	
A couple got so drunk on honeymoon in Sri Lanka that they woke to find they had agreed to buy the hotel.
Gina Lyons, 33, and Mark Lee, 35, had checked in and struck up a friendship with some of the staff, spending their first night drinking rum on the beach with one of the bartenders, who told them that the lease on the hotel was almost up.
During their trip, the London-based couple checked into a rustic hotel on the beach and immediately hit it off with some of the staff members there.
On their first night, they took to the beach with several bottles of rum and drank with one of the hotel's bartenders, where they were told the current lease on the hotel was almost up
Twelve glasses later, the couple decided to take it on for three years at a cost of 30,000, despite living in a tiny flat near Croydon in south London and still paying off their wedding.
As of July 1 this year, producer Gina and Mark, a sales director, officially own the hotel they drunkenly agreed to buy and have renamed it 'Lucky Beach Tangalle'.
Gina said: "When we walked into the hotel we saw a group of old Sri Lankan men who were still drunk from the night before, so we started drinking with them.
"The hotel looked grotty and very cheap, but it was by the beach and had the 'wooden tree house' feel that we like.
"When we were on the beach drinking rum, we were told that the lease was almost up for the hotel.
"After finding out that it was 10,000 a year, myself and Mark thought that it would be a brilliant idea to buy it - because we were so drunk.
"Now, almost a year on from our drunken idea, we own the hotel and have started doing the hotel up and making it ours."
Despite having had the initial conversation about purchasing the hotel whilst they were drunk, Gina explained the couple were also tipsy during the following, more serious, chats.
She said: "The next day we went and met an old couple who we had to speak to about renewing the lease ourselves.
"We had to take two friends we had made with us so they could translate for us, as the couple didn't speak English themselves.
"Because we didn't understand most of the conversation, Mark and I were just sat drinking more rum and slowly getting drunk again.
"After some bartering, we finally agreed that we would pay 30,000 for the three year lease and pay 15,000 in the first year and the other half by March 2019.
"But on top of that we had to pay about 7,000 legal fees in obtaining licenses and then 6,000 to refurbish, so it wasn't cheap."
Despite struggling financially, the couple managed to pay the first half of the lease - however they stumbled into an unexpected debt three months after agreeing the purchase in March this year, when Gina discovered she was pregnant.
Gina said: "When we had paid 8,000 of the lease, we found out that we were expecting a baby.
"I felt like I was already a bad mother because I felt guilty that I'd wasted all of this money buying a business that might not work.
"Even our friends and family think we're idiots and shouldn't have been doing it - we owed a lot of money from the wedding and only lived in a tiny flat, and now we had a baby on the way.
"I was plagued with feeling irresponsible, but it was either sink or swim - so we decided we'd have to make it work.
"That's when we decided to throw our all into it, both for ourselves and for the baby, and in July we officially became owners of the business."
Despite initially doubting their decision, the couple opened their seven-bedroom B&B at the end of July and have since had an inflow of regular customers.
And although the business venture has paid off for them, the couple insist that their decisions to expand will be made sober. (Source: mirror.co.uk)

Empowering sellers is the way forward in online retail
	
Naresh Krishnan, Head of Marketing and Traffic Ops Daraz Sri Lanka
With a mere 1% of the retail market, online retail is a high potential industry in countries of the South Asian region. Introducing the technology and knowledge to countries such as Sri Lanka has always been a challenge, as a result of varying barriers such as infrastructure, logistics and finance. At the event of completing 2 years since inception in Sri Lanka, Naresh Krishnan  Head of Marketing and Traffic Ops of Daraz Sri Lanka spoke about how the online retail platform has been revolutionized and the many enabling systems that have been introduced, for sellers and buyers alike.
According to Naresh, the online retail industry has undergone remarkable change over the past 2 years, with FMCG giants beginning to use the platform in large scale. The trend is a global shift as one sees all major brands investing more on online retail, as they see where the future lies. Sri Lanka too is fast absorbing the tendency where one sees many FMCG, mobile, automobile, health and beauty, and electronic brands increasing their online presence. The wide range of brands accessible on Daraz.lk is evidence enough for this growing trend. With our success in sales such as Black Friday, we saw a leap in the number of merchants, from well-known brands wanting to join us. They have realized that online retail allows them to engage with their customers better. This has been a boost for the platform, and as a result we have been constantly trying to empower them more by introducing new systems, stated Naresh.
Accordingly, as Daraz Turns 2, the company introduced an upscale seller system which enables the sellers to build their own brand. Daraz has developed a Smart Selling system, which breaks away from the traditional listing of a product on the platform under several categories. Through this merchants on Daraz receive their own store which can be designed according to their preference and used as their website to which other digital platforms can be connected and the traffic directed to it. As Daraz takes care of the infrastructure, logistics and customer care, the seller can concentrate on building the brand. In addition, sellers can create their own sales, vouchers and promotions. The Seller App which will be launched in the near future will enable sellers to monitor their sales in real-time and on the go, providing more selling opportunities.
Apart from focusing on the direct selling facilities, Daraz has also concentrated on enhancing the support service for a seamless process. The company has developed their own logistics arm with its own fleet to ensure timely distribution. In addition to a warehouse in Kelaniya, Daraz also owns a sorting center in Armour Street. 11 Daraz hubs in key towns in the island ensure the widespread reach, as the hubs have their own teams including a customer service agent, store manager and logistics wing. With these systems in place, sellers are ensured of speedy and safe delivery to their customers. The internal support system also includes a separate Seller Support team which exclusively addresses issues of the merchants. We at Daraz are very ambitious. We are preparing ourselves for the future market while serving at the present. Therefore our goal is not to only increase traffic to the platform and sell, but also ensure that a reliable system is put to place, commented Naresh.
The Daraz Seller University is an initiative no other platform has created for local merchants. This includes the Seller Self Sign-up system which enables merchants to sign up digitally without the hassle of manual documentation or personally meeting agents from Daraz. The University consists of an online course for merchants, which on completion ensures that they are able to use the whole system efficiently; from effective selling to creating promotions, store branding, packaging your product, dispatching and payment collection. As a result Daraz has around 20  30 sellers signing up on a daily basis.
Naresh further stated, Operating in 5 countries in the South Asian region, Daraz is one of the biggest players in the market. With our affiliation to Alibaba, we have further developed our technology and know-how, which we are keen to bring to Sri Lanka. We have seen an amazing response from the local merchants, as they are interested to learn and try out the new systems. Within a few days of the launch they were building their own stores, and creating their own promotions. This is what we want to see happening and we do our best to create a platform that is efficient and enabling for sellers. We are eager to see these systems falling to place as Daraz Turns 2.
All these systems were launched alongside the 2nd anniversary and is a smaller stepping stone to the next big campaign that Daraz will be introducing to Sri Lanka; 11/11. Also known as the Singles Day, 11/11 is one of the worlds biggest online sales, surpassing Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Sri Lanka will be fortunate to experience 11/11 for the very first time through Daraz.

Even I'm unable to comprehend pricing formula: Mangala
	
The Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said yesterday that even he cannot comprehend what this pricing formula was.
He said further that when people come to know what this formula was, they will also be affected mentally.
Minister Mangala Samaraweera made this comment at a media briefing held yesterday at the UNP head quarters Sirikotha in Pitakotte, replying to a question posed by a journalist. With the Pricing Formula on the Fuel pricing is in operation, it cannot be expected that there would be a price reduction today.
He also stated that until the beginning of February next year, one cannot have any hopes of a reduction in the price of oil in the World Market. The price increase of oil in the World Market and the value of the rupee are directly having their impact on the fuel price and it is expected to have a media briefing somewhere next week on the declaration of the pricing formula.

Fuel prices to increase with pricing formula
	
In accordance with the pricing formula activated by the Ministry of Finance, there is the possibility of the price of fuel being increased from today said the general secretary of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Trade Union D.J. Rajakaruna.
He said that in view of the appreciation of the Dollar and the price of crude oil in the world market rising an increase in the price of Fuel in the local market could be expected. During the past three months in which the pricing formula was in operation the price of Petrol and Diesel increased.
During the first three months from 10th July to 10th September the price of Octane 92 Petrol increased by Rs 12, Octane 95 Petrol increased by Rs 11, Supiri Diesel Litre by Rs 13 and Auto Diesel by Rs 14 the Petroleum Corporation stated. (Mahinda Nissanka)

Fuel prices up again
	
The retail prices of fuel have been revised with effect from midnight today based on the fuel pricing formula, the Finance Ministry said.
The breakdown of the fuel price increase are as follows: Lanka Petrol (Octane 92) by Rs.6 per litre where the revised price is Rs.155, Lanka Petrol (Octane 95) Euro 4 has seen an increase of Rs.8 per litre and will be sold at Rs.169. A litre of Lanka Super Diesel four Star Euro 4 will be increased by Rs.8 and the revised price is Rs.141.
The prices of Auto Diesel would remain unchanged.
According to the pricing formula implemented by the government to determine monthly fuel prices, the price of diesel needed to be increased by Rs.11, the Finance Ministry said.
However, the government had decided not to increase diesel prices due to the adverse effect it would have on the public, especially in relation to the transport sector and the fishing industry, they said.
Last May Cabinet approved the fuel pricing formula to help determine local fuel prices according to the fluctuation of international crude oil prices and the exchange rate of Sri Lankan currency.
The previous month's fuel price revision was calculated according to this fuel pricing formula. At that time, the price of a barrel of crude oil was USD 75 which had now risen to USD 84.
In Parliament yesterday Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said as a sensitive government they did not increase the fuel prices in line with international fuel price increases.This is why we took the decision not to increase the price of diesel due to the adverse effects it would have on key sectors.

Grade 5 Scholarship; to scrap  or not - EDITORIAL
	
While the debate whether the government should go ahead with the Grade 5 scholarship exam continues another set of young candidates, mostly from not so prestigious schools, has emerged top rankers at this years exam as well.
Interestingly five of the ten top slots, including a first place for which there was a tie, went to a relatively unknown school in the Kesbewa electorate. For the past decade or so Somaweera Chandrasiri Primary School in Piliyandala has been churning out Grade 5 Scholarship winners at a rate that it can give the so called prestigious Colombo schools a run for their money.
Unknown to many tens of thousands of parents struggle to get their children enrolled at Somaweera Chandrasiri Primary School for grade 1 every year. Largely owing to a team of dedicated staff this peripheral school in the Colombo district has been performing a miracle of sorts for years and one hopes that the Ministry of Education makes a note of that.
Besides once again proving the fact Gampaha is giving a tough competition to Colombo as a seat of primary education two candidates from Gampaha have got first and second slots while none of the so-called prestigious schools has got any. Its also heartening to witness the rise in the numbers of the northern and eastern students who clinch top slots. Jaffna Hindu College continues to shine with a student of its primary school emerging second tied with a candidate from Reggie Ranatunga Primary School Minuwangoda. Besides, students from small towns like Tellippallai in Jaffna and Nelukkulam in Vavuniya too have fared exceptionally well.
For the bulk of nearly 15,000 young candidates who got through the exam this is the only opportunity they get to join a school in their provincial capitals or Colombo before the O/Ls. Given the disparities in the standards of education between the village schools and the city ones from grade 6 onward, these young achievers hardly have a choice in the matter. 
While the winners are feted its difficult to forget the fact that the results have given heartache to another nearly 285,000 of ten year olds who could not get through the exam. Besides, the tortuous path trodden by both the winners and losers for nearly three years is certainly not something that these youngsters deserve to walk on at that tender age. Psychiatrists and many others have already protested against the decision to continue with the examination. 
Education Minister AkilaViraj Kariyawasam is on record that he would take a decision on the exam next year.
Several countries in the world have done away with challenging exams such as GCE O/L and Grade 5 scholarship exams which impose a mental pressure on the students and parents as well. We have still not decided on anything yet, but a decision would be taken on the two exams after speaking to educationists, Minister Kariyawasam has reportedly said. 
However still theres no guarantee that the minister would do away with the exam as for majority of students especially those in outstation schools this is the sole opportunity they get to get enrolled at a leading school in a city before the O/Ls. One may well argue that government should improve the standards of the outstation schools before taking such a decision. While that is not something thats going to happen in the near future it is also not ethical to subjecting a batch of nearly 300,000 ten-year-olds every year to this harassment.

Harping on price formula immaterial: PM
	
Talking of fuel price formula was becoming immaterial as oil prices could go up to $ 90 a barrel in the near future as a result of the global economic crisis, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament today.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, who was responding to a question raised by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake, said some countries believed that the price of oil could go up to $90 a barrel as a result of the global economic crisis.
Some countries believe that the price of oil could go up to $90 a barrel by November, with the US economic sanctions on Iran, he said.
Such a price hike could take place if the stocks of oil that the market could lose as a result of the sanctions, cannot be filled by other means, he said.
I discussed this matter with the UK and Norway during my visit and they said things were uncertain.
Therefore, what we should consider is how to face this global situation. We need to focus on this matter, not about price formula, Mr Wickremesinghe said.
What we should focus on is how to face the global economic issues and ensure concessions to people, he added.
He said Sri Lanka could be affected by the trade war between China and the US as well.
Elaborating on the fuel formula, he said it was introduced after receiving the Cabinet nod from May this year.
He said the unloading cost, operating cost, pipeline fees, the cost of fuel lost through evaporation, warehouse cost, and commissions given to sales agents, taxes were taken into consideration when deciding the price as per the formula.
This Government reduced the prices as soon as it was elected. However the prices have increased due to global developments but the current prices are still less than the price, which prevailed prior to 2015, he added. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardene)

He didnt want to be  the co-chief guest  !
	
A group of civil society leaders including some prominent academics and intellectuals had recently organized a commemorative ceremony in honour of the revered Indian national leader Mahatma Gandhi.
They had invited the Yahapalanaya Top Two to grace the occasion as the chief guests. The issuance of a commemorative stamp to honour the great leader too had been arranged for the occasion.
The Top Two had readily accepted the invitation. However, one of them had a few days later informed the organizers of the inability to attend the function giving no reason.
The highly disconcerted organizers had made indiscreet inquiries as to why one of them declined to attend the function. And they had learnt that he had confided the reason to his intimates: Why should I attend this function if the other leader too is attending it as a chief guest
Now that they knew the reason, they found a solution to get both leaders to attend the event. They had organized two separate functions on the same day to mark the same event. And while one of the Top Two attended one function as the chief guest, the other attended the other function in the same capacity! 
Those who are in the know of this story pose the question: How can two leaders unwilling to appear on the same stage together, rule a country together

He has yet to quit the official residence  !
	
The sporty Diyawanna politico from Wayamba, who had to quit yahapalanaya along with 15 other colleagues, is yet to quit the official residence assigned to him when he was a purohita. He continues to stay put in this residence disregarding several quit notices already served on him, they say.
His other 15 colleagues have now reportedly disowned the politico for his policy of trying to have one leg in yahapalanaya while having the other in the Opposition. Now they often refer to him by the nickname they themselves have coined for him: Gandabbha Siri.
Now a loner in the Opposition, the politico between two worlds as his nickname suggests, is said to be sticking to the official residence in the hope of getting once again a portfolio of the same status possibly carrying the same subject, they say.

I broke no protocols: ASP Liyanage
	
Responding to reports of preferential treatment to former President Mahinda Rajapaksas sons upon arrival in Qatar, Sri Lankan Ambassador to that country A.S.P Liyanage said that he broke no diplomatic protocols and therefore did nothing wrong.
Liyanage faced criticism when photographs of him carrying the bags of Yoshitha and Rohitha Rajapaksa at an airport in Doha went viral earlier this month.
The ambassador carried a bag, while a colleague brought two other bags in a trolley.
I did nothing wrong. These are boys that I have seen grow up and when I saw them struggling with several bags I naturally stepped in to help. I would have done that to anyone in such a situation, he said.
The two Rajapaksa sons were part of the team of Sri Lankan rugby players invited by the embassy to participate in the Ambassadors Rugby Cup.
As the embassy had invited the team to participate in the matches, we thought it was only right that we welcome the team at the airport. The Sri Lanka Navy rugby team will also be arriving in Qatar for a match soon and we will accord them the same privileges, Liyanage concluded.
Meanwhile, MP Namal Rajapaksa said earlier that his brothers were very capable of handling malicious personal attacks on nonsensical matters.
CH&FC was invited by the Doha Rugby Football Centre for a friendly match. The Sri Lankan Ambassador was at the airport to receive the team. My brothers are very capable of handling malicious personal attacks on nonsensical matters but keep CH&FC out from this delirious claims, he tweeted.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

Is the coalition in crisis or is it  fake-news
	
It is highly unlikely that any member would leave power for a coming administration

Any idiot can face a crisis - its day to day living that wears you out.- ~Anton Chekhov

Those who are greedily awaiting the comeback of the Rajapaksas are intensely engaged in this campaign- one of gossip and rumour-mongering.
Their wish that the current Parliament led by the United National Party (UNP) could be defeated by this method or that has gained currency at many a quarter, especially amongst the Colombo-based commission-traders, whose only ambition is to facilitate a return of the Rajapaksas to the office. These ugly and avaricious merchants of political power seek no limits; they seem to be answerable to no one; their thirst for illegitimate commissions and ill-gotten money is unquenchable and the insatiable desire of the fairer gender of this commission-cabal has overtaken the commonsensical pursuit of a place in the sun among the elite of Colombo.
Their sarees and jewellery purchased in the Indian marketplace cannot be left to gather dust. Attendance at the various cocktail parties hosted by the Rajapaksa allies is a must for that obscene ride to the top of the elite.
In order to topple the current coalition Government, crossover of a sizeable number of UNP Parliamentarians is indispensable; in the context of Ranil Wickremesinghes unchallenged leadership in the Party, it is unthinkable that, leave alone a sizeable number, a possibility of even one single Parliamentarian crossing over is far too remote. If there is one political party that is united today it is the United National Party; it is not owing to the genius of its leader but due to the fact that what is in power is a UNP-led Government.
It is never or highly unlikely that any member of the Government would leave power in search of or a mirage of position in a coming administration. It doesnt happen, period.
Most of these pundits and so-called intelligentsia do not understand that simple truth; political power is enormously attractive and its aphrodisiacal powers are unmatchable. There is only one incident in our post-independence history that a number of parliamentarians crossed over from government ranks and joined the then Opposition and that was in 1964 when C P de Silva and some of his SLFP-clan did the political somersault. As was related to this writer by J. R. Jayewardene himself, the architect of that political coup de grace, the only concession C. P. de Silva demanded from Dudley/JR duo was that his crossover would result in the toppling of the then Sirimavo-led SLFP Government. And it did happen. Therefore, in the absence of such a defection of UNP Parliamentarians from the Party, it is inconceivable even to theorize that the dream of the Joint Opposition (JO) could come true. Much trust and faith have been placed on Basil Rajapaksa, the younger brother of Mahinda, to negotiate a deal between the parties.
Basil, whose interest in politics had been sparked by his one-time close associate Anura Bandaranaike, when both were young. Basils performance as the virtual second-in-command in the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime, has come into question since the fall of that regime in 2015.
His reputation now is one of suspect, to say the least. Being in charge of allegedly uncountable and unaccountable stash of cash, he, during the 2015 Presidential Election campaign, had apparently attempted to literally purchase the votes of an unsuspecting public. And he failed.
Once again, it is he who is supposed to have come forward to negotiate a deal between the opposing parties. What is even more astonishing than anything else is the inclusion of President Maithripala Sirisena as a piece in the proverbial political chess game. Whether President Maithripala Sirisena would willingly take part in such a diabolical political dynamic is anybodys guess. What seems to have left the curious minds of all those who are grossly engaged in the current stream of politics is Sirisenas pledge at the time he took oaths as the new President of Sri Lanka on January 9, 2015, that his Presidency would be limited to one term. As was reported in the breaking news at the time, newly elected President Maithripala Sirisena says he will not contest for another term. Addressing the nation soon after being sworn in as the sixth President of Sri Lanka Maithripala Sirisena vouched he had no intention to run for a Presidential Election for the second time at the end of his first term.
We are notorious for having rather a very short memory; what is broadcast from atop a political platform is, more often than not, considered frivolous and short-lived. Yet at a time when one dictatorial President, who Mahinda Rajapaksa was, was dethroned and a new Master is enthroned, the people would undoubtedly take the term of office as one of a grave character, not only of the nature of the pledge, but more so of the man who is making such a pledge.
It is still not officially known whether Maithripala Sirisena has any intention of offering himself as a candidate at the forthcoming Presidential Election in 2020.
But what we must essentially bear in mind is the corrupting character of the institution of political power. Political power, among its debasing features, has the total capacity to corrupt its holder beyond all imagination. The political power, as much as its capacity for corrupting its holders, also has that intrinsic ability to being an obsessive charm of luxurious life; its glories have been penned and stored in history books so that the readers themselves get glued to its riveting nuances and society-changing appeals. However, to place Maithripala Sirisena among such dregs of politics is a disservice to the man.
With all his shortcomings, one cannot discard his simplicity in character and be ever ready to be identified with the commoner, Maithripala Sirisena, in fact, is a blessing that befell our nation in 2015.
The fastened bond that put President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe together has apparently loosened and its not too late to bond them once again. Yet, what must be emphasized is the term of office President Sirisena talked about in the wake of his being sworn in on 2015 January 9 as the new President of Sri Lanka. But if President Sirisena has changed his mind about the term of office, due to whatever reason, it is his responsibility and burdensome duty to declare it to the country with valid and legitimate arguments.
If such arguments are forthcoming and they appear to be authentic and credible, then its up to the electorate firstly and the coalition partners secondly, to accept or reject those arguments. Keeping the whole electorate in limbo is neither favourable to the current political equilibrium nor is it acceptable in a real sense of morality and ethics. Taken in such a dubious context of political uncertainty, the rumoured discussions among the trio of Sirisena and Rajapaksa brothers do matter. It affects the marketplace badly. The most effective way of affecting the economy of the country, especially its equity market, is this lingering uncertainty among its key players.
It seems to have had its repercussions; coupled with the depreciation of the rupee, our currency, the ballooning prices of essential commodities, this uncertainty needs to be exiled in a hurry. If not, the worst material conditions to follow, would result in a crisis the current administration doesnt look to be equipped to handle. Ranil Wickremesinghe, with all his reputation and experience in governance, seems to have lost his grip on priorities.
His abject failure to be realistic and down-to-earth is being exploited to the fullest by the JO and its chief propagandists. What is even more appalling is
Wickremesinghes failure to be decisive when it is of crucial significance. His failure to recognize the enormity of the ramifications of the infamous Bond-Scam has had its ill effects running to the core of the United National Party. What could have been nipped in the bud by asking the responsible parties to leave their respective offices, such as Governor of the Central Bank and the Minister of Finance is now coming to haunt not only Ranil Wickremesinghe himself, it is affecting the UNP and its parliamentarians in a thoroughly adverse way.
Dwelling on what has happened is of zero value unless one learns the lessons it teaches us. The UNP and its leadership seem to have lost their way down in the middle of their governing stretch.
Political power, as was repeatedly enunciated in this column itself, is a maddening dose that could either cleanse the whole system or act like an obsessive drug that can destroy very adventurous cells in a body. Right throughout history, its destructive powers have shown their ugly way. It has produced such cruel leaders as Hitler, Stalin and Idi Amin, to mention a very few in our post-industrial revolution times.
Although Ceylon has not had the misfortune of being cursed by such demonic leaders, we have also not been blessed with truly great ones whose moral compass had not been broken. The real tragedy is not realizing the nuanced characteristics of our own history and trying to follow them.

JO to request release of comm. report on Singapore FTA
	
The joint opposition (JO) yesterday said it would request the government to release the report on the Sri Lanka and Singapore Foreign Trade Agreement (SLSFTA) compiled by a committee of experts.
Addressing a news briefing, JO MP Bandula Gunawardana said they would stop opposing the SL-Singapore FTA if the Expert Committee appointed by the President says the it was not detrimental to Sri Lankan interests.
Meanwhile, he said it was unfortunate that neither the President nor the Prime Minister is in Sri Lanka to make important decisions when the country was facing a financial crisis.
The Finance Ministry Secretary and Fiscal Policy Directer are also not in the country at the moment. This is a grave situation. The rupee keeps depreciating and we just keep on blaming the US, Gunawardana said.
He said the foreigners have pulled out USD 193 million worth of funds invested in bonds as a result of the Central Bank bond scam. In addition, the government has released USD 1,090 billion invested in the Stock Exchange to the market in order to stabilise the value of the rupee, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Informal high-level talks are said to be going on behind the scene these days to bring about a rapprochement between the two Diyawanna factions of the Blue Party.
The one playing the main mediator role to unify the two factions is said to be Senior Bee from the central hills and all his efforts are now concentrated on winning over the Pohottuwa architect, who is said to be the main stumbling block to the move.
The arch-mediator had occasion to rendezvous with the Pohottuwa architect soon after the latters premature return from his vacation in Europe and used all his persuasive powers not sparing any trick in his political bag to get him on board with the peace move. However, the Pohottuwa architect had been cagey from the very outset and kept holding all his cards close to his chest.
Meanwhile, the Pohottuwa heavyweights have reportedly taken a decision to enter formal negotiations only if certain conditions they were to put down initially were met, they say.
Meanwhile, another issue, namely, which of the two parties, Pohottuwa or the Blue party should be conceded the right to nominate a candidate for the upcoming big poll has set a major poser to the leadership of both parties, informed sources say.

Remembering the lovable  Shibly  Aziz PC
	
In life he shared a radiant smile and in death I saw him, without any exaggeration, retaining that smile, as I paid my last respects to SHIBLY AZIZ on October 8 at his residence in Lake Drive, Colombo. The residence was packed to capacity with mourners. They were from all walks of life, but with a noticeable representation from the legal fraternity. I was privileged to pay my respects in the company of former Chief Justice Asoka de Silva.
Presidents Counsel Aziz was the Leader of the Official Bar as the then Attorney General of Sri Lanka (1995 to 1996), but more importantly he became the only one in recent times to be also elected as the Leader of the Unofficial Bar when he was voted to office as President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (2010-2012). There is little doubt that he earned this unique recognition of the countrys influential Bar not only because of his 50 years of contribution to the development of our legal system, but also because of his unwavering humility, a wonderful feature of a highly respected man the country just lost. He passed away in the early hours of Monday (October 8) and was laid to rest at the Jawatte Mosque Cemetery, the same evening amidst a very large gathering.
He was a member of the Constitutional Council of Sri Lanka representing the civil society, the last of several high positions that he held. He had also served as a member of the Law Commission of Sri Lanka and was also a member of the Council of Legal Education. He was widely recognised as the most knowledgeable authority in Sri Lanka on aviation and shipping law and was also a lecturer both at the Sri Lanka Law College in shipping and aviation law as well as at the University of Colombo. 
Shibly Azeez PC was well-known as an eminent Legal Counsel. But he was not motivated by the craze to become a money making machine. I do remember a number of instances when he gave free advice and at times appeared for individuals who were in financial difficulty.
He also served as an active President of the Ahadiya Association, the Sunday School of religious education which is an islandwide network of schools. Ahadiya movement was founded by his late father Marhoom Advocate M H Abdul Aziz of Galle. It remains a great institution that has guided many. It continues to guide thousands of youth away from wrongful conduct and take the path of offering a beneficial service to others. He has left us leaving an endearing smile in our hearts. May the Almighty grant him Jennathul Firdouse.

Singer found a novel way to end his song
	
It was a musical show organized by the youth of a town, where the artistes consisted of popular reputed singers.
The organizers had allowed some youth in the town who were amateurs also to come on stage and display their skills in singing.
The amateur who stepped onto the stage at the end of the show started to display his talents by singing a much quick tempo song, but half way his voice became silent and instead the thumping thud sound came out of the speakers that were on the stage. The organizer observing this unusual sound quickly began to check the sound system, while the musical band continued. In the rush the youth who was at the mike rendering his song quickly alighted from the stage. His friends who got round him began to congratulate him on his debut, and said if not for that upset in the sound it would have been a super hit.
The friends were in for a surprise when the songster declared it had nothing to do with the sound, I forgot a line of that song and made a sound with my mouth to time up with the music the band was playing and completed my act. (Christopher Cyprian)

Sri Lanka Army celebrates 69 years of its glory today : Soldiers Turned Nation-Builders
	
Soldiering in Sri Lanka during ancient, medieval, colonial, post-independent and contemporary times undoubtedly mirrors how the exercise of military power, as in the case of many countries around us, turned our Nation to Statesmanship while ensuring a potent and dynamic force for defence of the new nation-state in place. These histories, many of which are replete with sagas of gallantry and selfless dedication stand out as sources of inspiration to budding generations and serving troops alike and remind us that The art of war is of vital importance to the State. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or its ruin. Hence, it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected, as the great Art of War strategist Sun Tzu had quipped in his famous Treatise. 
The birth of Sri Lanka Army (then Ceylon Army) in 1949 on a day like today (October 10), just 20 months after severing servitude with colonial powers of Portugal, Holland and Britain, to gain our independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty, testifies to the foresight and wisdom the founding fathers of the new nation state have had at a time growing political communism was replacing imperialism in the aftermath of decolonization that began to occur in Asia after the World War II.
This pragmatic and visionary founding of a defence force, consequent upon a Defence Pact signed in 1947 with the Britishers on the verge of Ceylon gaining independence from the British Empire was purely to reinforce already existing armed wings (for example Volunteer forces, etc) in the country which also subsequently paved the way for founding of the then Ceylon Army. 
Cycles of Violence
With humble beginnings as a ceremonial outfit, the Armys life span after post-independence era was also of national significance since the support of Army troops was sought when ethnic tensions and internal strife occurred in 1952 (Hartal), 1959 (anti-Muslim riots), 1971 (JVP insurrection), 1983 (ethnic clashes), 1989 - 1990 (JVP terror), etc. The murder of 13 Army soldiers in one single incident in 1983 by Tamil Tigers in Jaffna and the subsequent threats that began developing in relation to the Northern security concerns made the Army play a more formidable role by virtue of the requirements considering ground realities. 
The escalation of LTTE violence in the North and East incurring huge human and public property losses compelled all service commanders, Police and defence authorities to think afresh, assess ground realities and devise new defensive strategies to take on the enemy who with the advance of time emerged as the most ruthless terrorist organization in the world, particularly after the assassination of Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi (1991), President Premadasa (1993), Ministers Ranjan Wijeratne, Gamini Dissanayake, Lalith Athulathmudali, et al. The Army assisted by sister services continued to hold their strongholds in the North despite fierce armed encounters with the LTTE terrorists. 
By September this year, the Army is busy either renovating or completely repairing nearly 2000 medium and small tanks in remote areas in Trincomalee, Polonnaruwa and the latest in Wellassa
Turning Point
The final quarter of 1999 and the period between 2004 was one of the most unpredictable milestones in the recent history since the LTTE making use of temporary cease-fires went on strengthening their armoury and replenished their fighting cadres. Yet, the Army remained confined to their barracks and camps across the North and East, honouring its commitment to peace. However, as in the case during the presence of the Indian Peacekeeping Force (IPKF) (1989-1992), the LTTE used the ceasefire to their maximum advantage both here and abroad. 
Win Over Terrorism
The notable closure of the Mavil Aru anicut by LTTE terrorists that supplies water for agriculture to more than 35,000 inhabitants in the East initialled the beginning of the road to the annihilation of the LTTE by ground troops as the public pressure was mounting against LTTE atrocities due to their non-ending spate of murder of innocent civilians, passengers, Buddhist monks, etc. Army troops as instructed from there onwards moved into dense eastern jungles and took on LTTE hideouts and cleared the entire east of the LTTE violence. Those battles of the Army, needless to reiterate, caused no harm to any civilian as reported and ended up effectively before ground troops began moving northwards. Sri Lanka Armys outstanding achievements in the northern theatre of violence between 2006-2009 have already gone on record. But one of the most humane approaches that had ever been made by any army in the world, for that matter, was the Sri Lanka Armys rehabilitation of near 13,000 LTTE terrorists, either caught alive or surrendered to the Army. 
Nation Re-building
The daunting task of nation-building, coupled with equally important restoration of moves of reconciliation, to avert any recurrence of violence in future is another landmark project that has now been undertaken by the Army since it possesses required manpower as well as the technical expertise. By September this year, the Army is busy either renovating or completely repairing nearly 2000 medium and small tanks in remote areas in Trincomalee, Polonnaruwa and the latest in Wellassa in order to boost agriculture and economy in respective areas. So much so, Army troops are engaged in multifarious construction projects at the request of the government and other sectors including religious places, schools, utility buildings etc for the benefit of the masses. 
After the year 2015, the Sri Lanka Army having engaged in bitter fighting for over 30 years has been instrumental in addressing their own structural and operational requirements to be in line with professional standards. In this regard, various new reforms are being executed with strict focus on extensive training modules and right-sizing of all units throughout the island to be in compliance with the incumbent Commanders visionary approach in terms of nation-building, training and administration of the organization. 
Additionally, the quick and rapid deployment of Army troops in the event of large scale national disasters and catastrophes, like landslides, floods, storms, garbage slides, etc has come in for praise of all quarters due to their unmatched skills to face any eventualities. Therefore, the present day Army has turned out to be the most sought service provider in the island who are capable of minimizing wastage and estimated costs in an impressive manner. 
SLA, now gaining recognition at foreign levels as a matured entity, has been proud to continue with its mega annual flagship projects, like Defence Seminar, Field Exercise, CormorantStrike, Army to Army Staff Talks etc.,
Foreign Recognition
Sri Lanka Army, now gaining recognition at foreign levels as a matured entity, has been proud to continue with its mega annual flagship projects, like Defence Seminar, Field Exercise, CormorantStrike, Army to Army Staff Talks and Defence Dialogues on routine basis. Its participation in overseas UN assignments as peace-keepers, observers or staffers has also brought fame and dividends to all ranks while achievements in the field of athletics and sports have also added special significance to the Army both at national and foreign spheres. Participation of its cultural troupes and band teams in international events is another landmark achievement of the Army in the most recent past. 
As the Roman poet, Horace once wrote encompassing ethos of bravery, It is sweet and fitting to die for ones country and brave sons and daughters of the Army in future too would explicitly exhibit their valour and determination to safeguard the interests of this nation at this milestone 69th Army Anniversary, commemorated on Wednesday (10). May our brave soldiers have the strength and wisdom to steer clear of all hurdles and take this beautiful isle of ours to prosperity and righteousness.

The Pidurangala fiasco and the inner dynamics of social media
	
Richkids image gives extravagant lifestyle and spread the idea among other youth
	It was the social media craze that prompted the youth to misbihave
	They should should have paid respect to the Sacred Buddishist shrine in the vicinity

Last month the Pidurangala Challenge became well-known for all the wrong reasons. The bare-bottom boys who found themselves behind bars for what they all though was a Facebook prank, must be thinking what really happened to them.

A lot of us wondered why these kids, some of whom had just sat for the A/Ls, did not realize what they were doing was insanely stupid. Hailing from the predominantly Buddhist Kurunegala District, they should have known better than to do what they did in a Buddhist sacred site. 
But why did they did they do that
During the initial questioning one of them gave a hint. He said that they wanted to be hits on FB. That they had taken up the challenge of a foreign woman, who had done the same baring the rear business, but was presumably now in a country outside of Sri Lanka, anticipating that the images would get loads of hits, interactions and shares. A simple web search of Pidurangala showed that the unfortunate group was not the first such miscreants on that rock. At the end of it, the images became more popular than they could have ever imagined. 
That these kids thought it cool to bare their buttocks to become popular on social media, tells us lot of about the platforms themselves, their inner dynamics and why they are so popular and money making machines. 

Social media thrives on interaction and engagement. But with millions playing the same field, the best way to attract attention is by being out of the ordinary
Because they pander to our innate want to feel good about ourselves, sometimes at the expense of others. Social media is like a mirror that we can project only what we want into the world and let it think, feel and exasperate that our lives are extraordinarily cool, rich and beyond compare. So social media is all about showing the best side about ourselves, the coolest side and richest side. In other words the most attractive side, or what we think is the most attractive side. 
There is a craze on Instagram tagged #richkids, there are rich kids of everywhere  even rich kids of Sri Lanka. The stream is full of images of exorbitantly expensive cars, jewellery, gadgetry, wads of cash, canines and even firearms. There are a few rich kids, or those who pretend to be such, who have posed with pistols and at least one with a larger firearm. The whole idea is to show the world that those in the pictures are coolest and richest kids around. 
Other kids who are growing up and easily influenced try to match the images  thus we end up with situations of young men baring their rears for no particular reason other than to get a few more likes on Facebook.
But this is also the attraction of social media and how the algorithms are set. Social media thrives on interaction and engagement. But with millions playing the same field, the best way to attract attention is by being out of the ordinary  so you show that you have more Bentleys than the chap who posted the pictures just before you, or more cash or if it is not cash, lets just add a pistol to the mix. 
And the profit machine will make sure that the platforms play up the most attractive posts as well as show you the posts that are most like the earlier posts you searched.
Without these gimmicks, web-based platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Google would not be billion dollar industries. 
So we are always going to come across the next one who will try to outmatch the Pidurangala fiasco. It is just question of when and how.

He told parliament that this government was not prepared nor had it any mandate to form a government with the political parties that were rejected by the people.

Some junior Diyawanna Greens are said to be in an ugly mood, they say.
Wherever they go, it seems, people ask them one common question which they are unable to answer. The question is what exactly is the Governments Oil Price Formula
The only person in yahapalanaya, who seems to know what this formula is Mangie, the one handling the countrys purse, they say.
So, the junior Greens have written to Mangies Ministry asking that the formula be made available to them, but they all have yet to receive a response.
They all have now decided to make their complaint to the party chief who happens to spend more time abroad than in the country these days and they are awaiting his return from his latest foreign tour, they say. These Junior Greens say that whenever they go to a village or meet media personnel they are invariably asked this question and they have to look dumb for they do not know what to say in reply.

Today is World Mental Health Day : A touch of counselling  to cure the troubled mind
	

The need to remove the stigma attached around mental health has been discussed in various platforms and the need to support and empower the well-being of those struggling with mental illnesses is crucial at all cost. The World Mental Health Day is commemorated today and it should be noted that many institutions are committed to raising awareness on the importance of mental health and how to address such issues in a positive note.
Safa Counselling Centre is one such institution that is recognized as a registered, non-governmental organization and is a project led by the Sri Lanka Muslim Womens Conference. Spearheaded by the President of the Sri Lanka Muslim Womens Conference and the President of the Safa Counselling Centre,Sikhamani Ameena Faisz Musthapha is also a senior and professional counsellor, who has committed her precious time for the upliftment of the mental well-being of many individuals through insightful lectures and counseling sessions. She was formerly a lecturer at the Family Studies and Services Institute which is a pioneer organization in marriage and pre-marriage counselling. The organization was formerly headed by the late Rev. Fr. Mervin. 
Because we are very much involved with mental health and counselling, we thought of commemorating World Mental Health Day, which falls on October 10. We have planned to host an event in the near future to fall in line with the World Mental Health Day says Ms. Musthapha. She said that the event would focus its attention on breaking the stigma attached around mental illness while making an appeal to educate families on why it is important to not overlook matters related to mental health at any cost.While emphasizing the need to treat those affected with mental illness in a kind and humane manner, she also noted the vital need for the diagnosis of the illness and professional assistance. 
When I came back, I noticed that the divorced rate is high among the Muslim community and I wanted to do something for our community. I wanted to start a counselling centre and a pre- marriage programme for them. When I suggested this to others, there were many good responses from counsellors, motivation speakers and successful professionals. We, together started preparing modules for pre-marriage counselling courses and other programmes. I received a big donation of thirty million rupees from IDB, which was utilized for establishing the large counselling centre at Kalubowila, namely the Safa Counselling Centre. The Centre was established in November 2015. We commenced our programmes at this establishment and also opened a counselling centre in the same premises where different types of problems were addressed such as parenting, marital stress etc. We have a very professional and confidential team of professionals to attend to such matters. We commenced our pre-marriage programme simultaneously for young couples who are planning to get married and for those who have just got married. These programmes were all conducted in English medium and were very successful in delivering a good service she added.The Centre also promotes self enhancing programmes such as anger management, stress relief and addiction.

People friendly counselling sessions
Despite its initial success, after realizing that the majority of people preferred to have the programme conducted in Tamil, arrangement was made to deliver the service in the preferred medium of language. Following a consultation with Azmiyas Saheed, the Director of the National Institute of Social Development, arrangements were done to conduct programmes in Tamil. We have conducted several programmes in the Tamil medium at the YMMA (Young Mens Muslim Association) in Dematagoda, Malwana, Akurana and Kahatowita. Since our knowledge was communicated to a very limited number of people, We decided to conduct a three day training programme known as the Training of Trainee Counsellors (TOT) to start Pre-Marital Counselling services around the island under Safa Counselling Centre. They can take back the message to any part of the island. These programmes were held in Akurana, Kandy and Matale. Now we are planning to have another similar session conducted in the eastern province. We dont receive any funds except for what we get from generous donors to maintain the centre. The Safa Counselling Centre is purely a service oriented institution committed to the welfare of people. The counselling centre is open for anyone in need of professional help Musthapha said. Reflecting on how grateful the participant were, Mustapha said that the programme has facilitated in raising much awareness on marriage and in shifting the participants focus beyond the horizons of wedding plans only. 
Safa Counselling Centre is one such institution that is recognized as a registered, non-governmental organization and is a project led by the Sri Lanka Muslim Womens Conference
Safa Counselling Centre has been instrumental in launching several projects such as marriage workshops mainly to enlighten young men and women aspiring to marry or who are already married on how to overcome the increasing risks of divorces which have significantly increased in the country. As much as minimizing the risks of divorce rates in Sri Lanka, the workshop also focuses on the avenues to build, improve and maintain healthy relationship that should be nurtured and developed between a husband and wife. 
Shantialaya Home for Mentally Ill Patients
Adding to the above, it is also worthy of note that the Richmond Fellowship Lanka has been in operation in Sri Lanka for over twenty years and contributing immensely to the cause of mental health in this country. Richmond Fellowship was inaugurated in 1998 under the guidance of late Ms. Malini Balasingham, who had a vision to institute a half way home for in house rehabilitation, where inmates referred to as clients, would be admitted to the home for a maximum period of two years.
According to Musthapha, a meeting with Ms. Ellen Jansen, Founder Member of the Richmond Fellowship in London paved Balasingham the way to lay the set up for a Richmond Fellowship to be inaugurated in Sri Lanka. In addition to its objective of setting up an in house rehabilitation centre for clients suffering with mental illnesses, the institution also focuses its attention on advocating on all aspects related to mental illness among the community. The Richmond Fellowship Sri Lanka is a non-profit and registered company with the Ministry of Social Services and the Ministry of Health of Sri Lanka.
When patients are discharged from the Mulleriyawa hospital, they are often sent back to their homes where often family members do not know how to treat or take care of them. Under the supervision of late Balasingham, a home was established for such inmates at Bopitiya as Shantialaya  a heaven of peace, care and tranquility. With the contributions of generous donors, we were able to purchase a 40-perch block of land from Bopitiya, close to Ja-Ela where we built the home. The two storeyed building can comfortably accommodate 25-30 residents. Currently, I work in the capacity of the Patron for Shantialaya Home for Mentally ill Patients.
During my visit to London, I received sufficient funds to have two homes built for males and females separately. We conduct different therapies here, that range from vocational therapy to dancing and music. Once the patients are discharged from the hospital in Mulleriyawa, they are often directed to our home where we have a nurse, doctor, matron and a warden who run the place very well Musthapha added. She concluded by saying that there were many cases of successfully rehabilitated individuals who have left the half way homes to live within the community.

UNDERSTATED IMPORTANCE!!!
	

A picture is worth a thousand words they say, well, in this case, it is worth billions!!! Starting this column off today, it is a real pleasure to dwell on these gentlemen, for they are gentlemen in every sense of the word!!! Self-made, in no way inclined to boast, to show off, they dont have to, dont need to and more importantly, dont want to!!! Why then do the billionaires and millionaires of our country, mercifully not all of them though, find this compelling need to boast about what they have, how they acquired their wealth, find a greater compelling need to be recognized wherever they go, dressed to kill, flashing their wealth, talking loudly, so loud they could be heard in the next street WHY, WHO ARE THEY HOPING TO IMPRESS Conversely, take a look at the picture above; supremely confident, devoid of the need to show off.!!! They each had an idea that changed the world, they took one step that started their journey and achieved what others thought was impossible!!! Never stop looking for opportunities, possibilities are endless; even when it seems like there is only one door, there almost always are!!!


Caught in the web
Restricting Internet access to children is something this column talked about a long time ago, especially when we highlighted how drugs were being sold in schools under the guise of sweets!!! Our children today have absolutely no childhood as we did; sadly their lives are spent with iPhones, smartphones, iPads, tabs, and the competition is to see who has the most sophisticated one!!!
They are glued to these devices and some have even started Cyber Violations, but the Government is still waiting till next year to impose restrictions on use!!!Unlike in our days, children are burdened with the hassle of tuition because it is only then they actually learn anything, never in school!!!


Who is fooling whom
One newspaper says the Prime Minister lauds Police for achieving progress in crime-control, but we read in others that the majority of crimes seem to be perpetrated within the Police Department per se with question marks over the IGP himself!!! Who is fooling whom


Who isnt afraid
Pathalaya, the Underworld, is King we are told!!! They had gone underground for some time but have resurrected again!!! Apparently, when someone, anyone, sells land or anything of value, the advertisement and the sale are followed and closely monitored!!! Monitored to the extent where you get a telephone call asking at what price you sold your land or vehicle or whatever and they go on to say Aparadai meaning What a shame, we would have bought it for so much more, we understand how valuable it is!!!
One week later you are visited by an unknown quantity with either a revolver or a knife in hand and asked to hand over a certain amount of money; the Pathalaya is at work and God help you if you dont pay!!! Telling the Police is of no avail, they have already disappeared; no one knows from where they come or where they go to!!! The organization is so closely knit that no one talks and those who talk know they are facing certain death!!! In the temple areas like Bellanwilla, Pillaywa, Kelaniya and other places where flowers and incense are sold, they boldly walk the streets and with the same bravado walk into those little shops demanding their contribution, which they get from one and all and on a daily basis at that!!! In the Colombo city bus centre, they watch the buses going outstation and just go and stand by the entrance door of the bus and without any fuss, the conductor comes up with 100/- or 200/- and the bus is allowed to go!!! This is demanded from every bus!!! These demands are negligible compared to the lives they take, as far as we have heard, two in Tangalle, two in Kokkuvil, two in the Hikkaduwa area and counting!!! The people are afraid, the Police are afraid, who isnt afraid when the ultimate sacrifice is precious Human Life!!!

UNHRC resolution: SL has made considerable progress: Marapana
	
As regard to the UNHRC resolution 30/1 co-sponsored by the US and Sri Lanka and adopted in early October 2015, Foreign Affairs Minister Tilak Marapana said Sri Lanka has made considerable progress on complying with the requirements expected of Sri Lanka.
Further more, the resolution overlapped undertakings in the EU for Sri Lanka to obtain GSP+ facilities and the lifting of the export of fish ban, Minister Marapana told Daily Mirror yesterday.
The establishment of the Office of Missing Persons (OMP), passing of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance Act, tabling of Reparations Bill and the Counter Terrorism Bill are the steps taken in the right direction by Sri Lanka to fulfil her obligations.
We have had regular consultations with other co-sponsors, EU, UK and Canada and those who voted for the resolution at the UNHRC who have expressed their appreciation on the progress that has been made by Sri Lanka. Further, anyone could see himself how this government has restored democracy, rule of law, the independence of judiciary and media. Today, no one has the feeling of insecurity, abduction or disappearance. The government has also constituted the Constitution Council and through it established independent commissions. No suppression of media and harassment on media personnel, critical on the government, Minister Marapana emphasized.
Many diplomats met him had acknowledged the vast difference witnessed in Sri Lanka with the advent of the unity government, he said.
They have commended Sri Lanka for the progress that had been made and noted that other countries could emulate Sri Lanka to achieve similar results.
What is significant is that Sri Lanka has achieved this progress without sacrificing its core policies or individuals, Minister Marapana stressed.
As regards to myths of alleged international pressure, Minister Marapana said there was no pressure as such.
We have taken upon ourselves the reforms which are beneficial to our people. In this regard, the government is well aware of where we should draw the line. We are confident that the International Community will defend us to the hilt at the March 2019 sessions of the UNHRC and therefore no one must unnecessarily worry about it, Minister Marapana stressed.

US-SL Navies rescue fishermen stranded off Galle Harbour
	
The Sri Lanka Navy with the assistance of the US Navy rescued seven fishermen in distress in the seas off the Galle harbour yesterday.
The Navy said the fishermen aboard the vessel Suma Baba-03 had left the Galle harbour on October 3 for fishing and were stranded when the vessel engine failed.
The USS Decatur, an American warship which was sailing on a close passage had observed the distressed trawler and rescued its crew.
Thereafter, the US ship had reported the incident to the Maritime Rescue Coordinating Centre (MRCC) in Colombo.
The Sri Lanka Navy then deployed SLNS Jayasagara from the Southern Naval Command to bring the fishermen and trawler ashore.
The fishermen boarded SLNS Jayasagara about 130 nautical miles south of the Galle Harbour and the trawler was safely towed back, the Navy said.

Voices of Peace speak loud and clear
	
Panel of speakers (Pix Waruna Wanniarachchi)

It is through their eyes that we will attempt to understand their struggles. The beauty of it, as well as its ugliness - (Bilbatua, 2014)
The latest book on the most discussed, yet seldom reflected topic of the once war-ridden countrys recent past, Voices of Peace was launched recently at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute, Colombo. The memoirs of ten ex-Sri Lankan soldiers and ten former LTTE cadres have been compiled after more than 2 years of extensive research and interviews. 
Sarah Kabir, a researcher and humanitarian worker whose focus has primarily been on peace-building and development work has authored this balanced narrative, accompanied by compelling images captured by photographer Munira Mutaher. 
They were just like us is the pang of realisation the author has attempted to invoke in the reader. However, it is apparent that this realisation has already dawned upon this group of storytellers, for, it was the same battle they faced despite them having fought on opposite sides. Empowering through storytelling is a novel and effective approach to reconciliation. The empathy and compassion that follow after one listens to the accounts of the spoils of war, first-hand from those who battled at the front lines, is what will move our nation forward from this stagnant state of negative peace. 
Empowering through storytelling is a novel and effective approach to reconciliation
Negative peace, or, the absence of war/ overt violence, is only a transient state and its high time the country moved past and proceeds to build positive peace, which creates approaches to reconciliation, addresses past injustices and moves toward long-term, sustainable peace. The recent tensions between the Sinhalese and Muslim communities further stresses the crucial need for sustainable peace, in a culturally diverse country as ours. 
It was my interactions with the other side that truly changed how I feel about them- (Ponkalan, a storyteller)
The launch of Voices of peace was attended by a diverse audience including the former Defense Secretary, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Economist and Parliamentarian Dr. Harsha de Silva, Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa, members of foreign missions in Sri Lanka, political luminaries, media personnel, academics, professionals, activists and book enthusiasts. 
Your presence is a first step said Sarah Kabir, as she addressed and acknowledged the invitees and those present. Hopefully this leads to more listening; listening to the people whom you actually want to help. Drawing her inspiration from the internationally acclaimed Tunisian activist Aya Chebbi, who urged the world to listen, Sarah implored the audience to view both sides of a story, thus, to be protected from the danger of falling prey to binaries of us and them. 
Dr. Jehan Perera, the Executive Director at the National Peace Council of Sri Lanka moderated a distinguished panel of invited speakers. Dr. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, Saliya Pieris (PC) and Aranya Rajasingham each offered their perspective and shared their insights. 
Communication is absolutely pivotal remarked Dr. Saravanamuttu, the Executive Director of the Centre for Policy Alternatives, as he pointed out that the testimonies of the sufferers are not being given the prime time that they deserve. He also lauded the sheer commitment and determination of the author in her journey of bringing together this commendable and controversial project. 
Saliya Pieris (PC), Chairman of the Office on Missing Persons, stressed that it is of importance that we as a nation recognise that there are multiple narratives to the conflict. He invited the author to include a third point of view, that of the civilians in her next project. 
Aranya Rajasingham, a womens rights and peace activist, urged to see the humanity in those at the battlefront, regardless of the factions they represented. She persuaded that they need not be defined, or rather, reduced a to a mere uniform. She also noted that the combatants were seldom included in policy making and as beneficiaries. Apart from the obvious binary of the LTTE and the Sri Lankan Army, there are multiple angles to be considered such as the para military groups, different political factions, Aranya stated, dwelling deeper into the subject. 
A question and answer session took place, where the concerns and insights of the visitors were entertained. 
The author, in her final remarks, added that she hoped that the book would offer insights on the conflict and the post-conflict situation in Sri Lanka and that she also welcomed constructive criticism and feedback. The content is narrated to the reader along a timeline, and one is able to journey with the storyteller throughout the decades of struggle towards the present day. Even though it is close to impossible to fact check the stories told, this project is not about fact-finding or a quest for the absolute truth, but rather highlighting what these experiences meant and the impressions left on them. 
Hopefully this leads to more listening; listening to the people whom you actually want to help
More than just a book, Voices of Peace is more of a tool to influence policy on peace-building and it is hoped that the ownership of the peace building process be shifted to those on the front line, and also thereby relieving the veterans and victims of the burden of untold stories.We, the readers, need not await those who are tasked with reconciliation efforts, to make a difference. An abundance of opportunities exist and await our attention. We need only open our minds and welcome any effort that promotes peace, and this case, by listening to the Voices of Peace. 
Voices of peace is the first book Kabir has authored. She hopes to have this book translated into Sinhala and Tamil, for a wider readership. Priced at LKR 1200, the English Edition will be available soon at leading bookstores.

Were the varsity students incited  
	
When a group of cinema lovers and artistes from the South took the initiative to hold an international film festival in Jaffna they had to face opposition from several quarters. In fact, they had been much dismayed when a certain group from the Jaffna University vowed they would not allow the event to take place.
The organizers who made inquiries had later traced the driving force behind the anti-festival University group to the main chair of a major administrative body in the North. The Chief had reportedly inflamed the young University students with an exhortation carrying a racialist undertone.
The leadership of the main alliance in the North had reacted angrily to the news that the Chief was behind the protest by the University boys. The party leadership has many scores to settle with the provincial chief. This affair has become yet another score! a source from Jaffna said.
