Video: 6,000 Avant Garde employees risk losing jobs
	
Days after the operations of Avant Garde Maritime Security Limited (AGMSL) was taken over by the Sri Lanka Navy, thousands of its employees today claimed that they risked of losing their jobs.
AGMSL's Former Senior Manager of Commercial Vessels Protection Operations, Lt. Colonel (Rtd) Nilantha Jayaweera said despite legal assurances that the Avant Garde security firm had defence ministry clearance to operate, the taking over of the weapons on board ?MV Mahanuwara? and ?MV Avant Garde? would result in some 6,000 employees losing their jobs and it is totally unfair.
?The Avant Garde is being talked about by politicians who do not have any proof against our company. This company was established with the intention of providing a respectable and prosperous profession for those who retired from the tri-forces. By providing security to foreign vessels we were involved in earning a large amount of foreign exchange for our country,? he said.
?While our employees earned millions a month, we spent a large portion of our income for charitable works. Nearly 227 families having no links to either the tri-forces or to Avant Garde are dependent on the income we earn. The baseless allegations levelled against our company is a ruse to mislead the people and grab the ownership of our company,? Mr. Jayaweera claimed.
However, he said if the allegations were proved then Rakna Arakshaka Lanka Ltd (RALL) should be prosecuted because Avant Garde is connected to agreements with RALL which had issued permission for all operations carried out by Avant Garde until last week.
Meanwhile, retired Navy Commander Nilupul De Silva who handled the operations of MV Avant Garde said the vessel was forcibly taken into Navy custody on Friday even though the AGMSL did not violate any maritime law.
He said the truth had been glossed over by a few powerful persons by painting a wrong picture in the people?s minds on the Avant Garde controversy.
They requested President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Health Minister, Cabinet Spokesman Rajitha Senaratne and Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake to give them an opportunity to have a direct discussion on this matter before losing their jobs.

Rajitha rubbishes Wijeyadasa's allegations as baseless
	
	Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senaratne has rejected Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe's allegations that Dr. Senaratne was found guilty of importing substandard drugs.
	Addressing a public rally at Polegoda in Bulathsinghala, he said he did not have any personal animosity against Minister Rajapakshe and that he had a cordial discussion with him at the recent cabinet meeting.
	?He remained silent at the cabinet meeting when I mentioned the Avant Garde controversy. But he gives interviews to the media. He had told the media that I was found guilty of importing substandard drugs and lost my parliamentary membership. It is absolutely false. Justice Mahanama Tilakaratne who heard the case held that it was a fabrication and exonerated and acquitted me. His judgment ran into 400 pages. Minister Rajapakshe should have read the judgment. He has accused me of procuring medical equipment. This is another false allegation. I was victimized by filing false charges against me for criticizing the government. However, It was Minister Rajapakshe who appeared for the cases of the government and earned money. Medical equipment is procured by import companies under a contract with the government. He has accused me of issuing a letter to Avant Garde company requesting for employment to some individuals. If a supporter requests a letter of recommendation for employment I comply with such a request. I am also in possession of similar letters issued by Minister Rajapakshe,? Minister Senaratne said.

Another twist in Grand Hyatt saga
	
	A letter from Public Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim revealed that he intends to change the entire board of directors of the state-owned Grand Hyatt Hotel holding company Canwill Holdings (Pvt.) Ltd (Canwill).
	??A letter dated November 5, 2015 to Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (SLIC) said that the minister intends to appoint a new board. Somebody has said that we are the Finance Minister?s people. We have also been told not to open tenders and we?re awaiting further instructions,? a top Canwill Holdings official confirmed.
	Neither Minister Hashim nor his Deputy Minister Eran Wickremaratne was available for comment.
	Canwill Holdings was transferred to Hashim?s ministry from the Finance Ministry during the Cabinet restructuring in September. Company sources said that Minister Hashim was not happy with the procedures followed by the company in awarding tenders. ?
	However, the official said that all tenders since the new management was elected this February have been opened with the approval of the three shareholders of Canwill Holdings?SLIC, which has 45.95 percent of the shares, the Employees? Provident Fund (EPF), which has 27.03 percent, and Litro Lanka, which has another 27.03 percent.
	The current board includes Chairman Hemaka Amarasuriya, who is the Chairman of SLIC, Managing Director D.R.P. Abeysinghe, construction sector professional Dr. Rohan Karunaratne, an engineer, Litro Gas Chairman S. Munasinghe, Finance Ministry Deputy Director P. Liyanage, EPF Superintendent R.A.A. Jayalath and S.D. Martino representing the private sector. ?
	All tenders were published in newspapers and have adhered to the strict guidelines of the national procurement processes, according to the official.
	Employees of Canwill Holdings told Mirror Business that they have already received proposals for two tenders on interior decorations worth Rs.2 billion, which have been placed on hold for nearly two months, while two other tenders concerning interior decoration and power supply have not been opened.
	They said that the idling of construction and not opening the hotel on time as planned in 2017 could cost the public millions of rupees.
	The employees added that both they and the foreign partners in the project are happy with the environment created by the current board of directors.
	Hashim has recommended that two individuals from the hotel trade to be appointed as the new Chairman and Managing Director.
	Employees criticized the appointment of hoteliers, saying that officials of engineering and financial backgrounds are required during the construction phase and said that the past regime too had retained a hospitality staff under the company?s payroll for years during construction, causing losses.
	Further, upon completion, management of the hotel will fall under the world famous Hyatt brand.
	The project was initially estimated to be Rs.18.5 billion but Canwill Holdings employees said that the cost had increased to Rs.31 billion under the past regime amid gross mismanagement, leading to the project being halted.
	The official said that an unqualified project manager and inexperienced engineers and accountants were replaced with ?the most qualified? Chartered Architect in the country and other qualified personnel, respectively at a fraction of the costs.
	?The past contractors are still on board and we have negotiated with them to save Rs.400 million from the contracts. We have saved Rs.500 million since February when we appointed the new project manager and engineers,? the official added.
	Meanwhile, President Maithripala Sirisena during the Cabinet swearing in ceremony in September said that changes to boards of directors and heads of state-owned entities must go through a joint Presidential and Prime Ministerial panel.(Chandeepa Wettasinghe)

During this powwow, one purohita asked his colleagues: ?Why on earth are they trying so hard to white-wash the high ups of this company??
?Don?t you know that the son of that one ? is running this show from behind the scene!? the reply came from a yahapalanaya purohita who trotted out the name of a colleague and his son.
?Ah! That son! He is a very young chap?He was doing a job in a key Ministry,? the purohita who raised the question recalled.
?He is the man!? the other confirmed. ?He claims that he has the blessings of the dear and near ones of those in the highest echelons in yahapalanaya!?
?It means that a full expose of this affair could leave egg on the face of those in the highest echelons as well! Then it is our duty to warn our bosses on time,? another purohita said.

EU urges govt. to repeal PTA
	
The Council of European Union (EU) yesterday encouraged the Sri Lankan Government to take early steps to build the confidence of communities, including releasing the identity of the detainees and accelerating their prosecution or release, repealing the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA).The full statement by the EU
The EU welcomes the significant advances made by the Government of Sri Lanka since the presidential elections held in January 2015 to restore democratic governance, initiate a process of national reconciliation and re-engage with the international community and the United Nations (UN).
Following the invitation by the Government of Sri Lanka, the European Union deployed an Election Observation Mission (EU EOM) to observe the parliamentary elections in August, which were assessed positively by the EU EOM. The elections saw a strong endorsement of the change in policies initiated since January. In line with the Government's commitment for electoral reform, it will be key to implement the recommendations provided by the EU EOM.
There are now new opportunities for the EU to engage with the Government of Sri Lanka in making further progress on reconciliation, strengthening good governance and tackling corruption, promoting respect for human rights and the rule of law, and fostering inclusive economic growth and sustainable development, while continuing work to reduce poverty and addressing global issues such as climate change and sustainable development. The EU and its Member States actively support the new reform-oriented dynamism in Sri Lanka in order to overcome underlying causes of the past conflict. In this spirit, they will review their respective assistance programmes to support these objectives, including ensuring coordination with other donors.
The Council welcomes the resolution "Promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka" adopted at the 30th session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva as a crucial step towards a credible transitional justice process in the country. The Council commends the Government of Sri Lanka and the Tamil National Alliance for respectively sponsoring and supporting the resolution. Continued political leadership will be needed from all sides to ensure the implementation of a comprehensive approach to deal with the past and at the same time establish a lasting foundation for a peaceful future. In this regard, the Council takes positive note of Sri Lanka's proposal to establish a Commission for Truth, Justice, Reconciliation and Non-Recurrence, and to set up with the expertise from the International Committee of the Red Cross, an Office on Missing Persons.
Accountability is essential to uphold the rule of law and build confidence in the people of all communities of Sri Lanka in the justice system. The EU welcomes Government of Sri Lanka's proposal for the establishment of a judicial mechanism to investigate allegations of violations and abuses of human rights, including allegations of sexual violence. The participation of foreign judges, defence lawyers, prosecutors and investigators will be important in ensuring that the process is both credible and perceived as such by all sides. The Council underlines the importance of continued cooperation with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.
Addressing the underlying causes of the conflict will be key to uniting the people of Sri Lanka. The EU welcomes the steps that have been taken to strengthen civilian administration in the North and East and calls on the Government to move swiftly to find durable solutions for all Internally Displaced Persons. The devolution of political power to the provinces, as originally envisaged in the Thirteenth Constitutional Amendment, will be a vital step in allowing communities to have their say in how they are governed and a positive contribution to the reconciliation process. The EU takes note of the Government's plans for a new Constitution. Initiation of a broad domestic dialogue and consultation on wider constitutional change will be vital to ensure the sustainability and popular support for any changes that are ultimately proposed.
The Council encourages the Government of Sri Lanka to take early steps to build the confidence of communities, including releasing the identity of the detainees and accelerating their prosecution or release, repealing the Prevention of Terrorism Act, calibrating the military presence according to identified security needs and returning land sequestered by the military to its rightful owners. Further action is also needed on a number of human rights concerns, including sexual and gender based violence, torture and the protection of persons belonging to religious, ethnic and other minorities, Human Rights Defenders and journalists.
The Government of Sri Lanka has indicated its intention to apply at the appropriate time to be granted the tariff preferences provided under the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance (GSP+). The Council reiterates that the purpose of GSP+ is to encourage beneficiary countries to effectively implement the core international conventions on human and labour rights, environmental protection and good governance. It takes positive note of the progress recently achieved and encourages Sri Lanka to undertake all remaining necessary preparatory work. The Council calls on the High Representative and the European Commission to continue to engage with Sri Lanka to support its efforts to lay the groundwork for a renewed application for GSP+.
The Council commends the steps Sri Lanka has taken to comply with the regulations of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission and encourages the Sri Lankan authorities to take the further measures necessary to address the shortcomings established in the context of the EU legislation on Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing, so that the ban on fishery exports to the EU can be lifted as soon as possible.
The Council looks forward to regular updates on future progress and welcomes continued dialogue between the EU and the Government of Sri Lanka, including through meetings of the joint bodies established under the Cooperation Agreement on Partnership and Development.

Though the purpose of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) is to protect the people from security threats, the government is attempting to make out that the PTA as something frightening, former UPFA MP G.L. Peiris charged today.
He claimed that the government was using the PTA to arrest and punish security forces personnel while releasing former LTTE cadres detained under the PTA. He criticized the government move to release ex-LTTE cadres claiming it posed a threat to national security.
?Many people were attempting to belittle the PTA. Even the UN Human Right Commissioner called for its repeal. Therefore, the government which co-sponsored the UNHRC Resolution on Sri Lanka is attempting to describe the PTA as something detrimental,? Prof. Peiris said.
Commenting on the recent terrorist attacks in Paris, he said even that country is strengthening laws and regulations and taking security measures to protect the country from terrorism.
Claiming that TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran had requested visiting Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop to appoint an Australian prosecutor to the proposed special court to inquire into war crimes allegations, he asked what authority the TNA had to make such a request.
?TNA is not the government and they are in no position to make such a request unless the government has given them the authority to do so,? Prof. Peiris said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)WATCH

Her bid to cover mistake proved a bigger mistake
	
The New Big Boss who was on an official visit to Bangkok recently was due to meet the compatriot community in that country at a special function on the sidelines of his official engagements.?
Meanwhile, our fair envoy based in the Thai capital had also organized a dance performance by a well-known troupe from here to enliven the occasion.?
Before attending the function, the new Big Boss had wanted to know who the Sri Lankan artistes were billed to perform on the occasion. And he had been highly annoyed to learn that they had got down two artistes who had to appear before a commission probing financial crimes allegedly committed during the previous regime. He immediately cancelled this engagement and later pulled up the madam who was the livewire behind the event, they say.
Undeterred, the madam next organized a gala dinner in honour of the visiting Head of State on board a luxury ship hired for the purpose. She had arranged to entertain the New Big Boss and the other guests invite to the ?dinner while the ship was on a two-hour cruise.?
The new Big Boss this time round reacted with anger when he was informed of this offbeat arrangement obviously organized to win brownie points. ?I have no hankering for a dinner on board a ship,? he told the madam. ?Please stop squandering public funds in this fashion.?
After ordering the cancellation of the dinner on board the ship, the new Big Boss himself had taken the initiative to host a group of his guests to dinner with Sri Lankan culinary delights.?
Meanwhile, the Foreign Affairs authorities are set to hold an inquiry into the conduct of this fair envoy for marring the new Big Boss? visit to Bangkok, they say.?

Video: BBS warns Govt. of impending attack by ISIS
	
	Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thera today sounded a warning to the government over an ISIS attack on this country within a year.
	He said this while addressing a media briefing at Kirulapona yesterday.?Several bomb blasts will rock Sri Lanka within a year. We make this prediction with responsibility. As predicted by us earlier, a Sri Lankan Muslim from Galewela was killed while fighting for ISIS in Syria recently. Every prediction we have made have become reality,? the Thera said.
	The Yahapalana Government has destabilised the local intelligence service, therefore, international terrorist organizations such as ISIS can easily engage in carrying out their hidden agenda inside the country, the prelate charged.
	Due to lax VISA regulations, Sri Lanka is fast becoming a hotspot for terrorist activities for them to spread fear among our people.?Three State Intelligence Service officers were detained under a detention order and they were imprisoned for three months without any bail conditions being set. No one is bothered about their release. If the Yahapalana government and the NGO?s are contemplating the release of ex-LTTE cadres - who had been remanded for serious war crimes - why can?t the government take some initiative to release these intelligence officers?? he questioned.
	?The previous government was more concerned about national security. They were planning to build a military headquarters, but the present rulers have terminated the process and are trying to push the country into a dangerous situation. The construction site of the military headquarters was later converted into a shopping complex by this government,? he further said.
	?The present regime is pushing the country?s development process backwards due to many projects that were halted by them,? The Thera added. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Pivithuru Hela Urumaya not to take part in APC
	
	The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) today announced that it would no longer take part in the All Party Conference (APC) convened to consult the political parties? opinion on how to address UNHRC resolution on Sri Lanka, claiming that the APC was only a media show.
	Writing a letter to President?s Secretary P.B. Abeykoon, PHU General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila said despite the mandate of the APC to consult opinion of all the parties, the government had already taken a number of decisions on its own.
	He said these decisions were not only detrimental to the national security of the country, they would also entangle the country more deep in the international trap it?s already engulfed in.
	?It seems the notion of the APC is to show to the world that the opinions of all the parties are considered when making decisions. Therefore, we don?t want to take part in such a drama. However, we will not hesitate to give our assistance if the government genuinely decides to face international challenges after having discussions with other parties,? Mr. Gammanpila said.
	Addressing a news conference, he said US representative to the UN Samantha Power is scheduled to visit Sri Lanka on November 23 and questioned what?s the reason behind her visit was.
	Meanwhile, National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader MP Wimal Weerawansa said they would not allow the country to fall prey into any danger but said if the government intentionally putting the country in an international trap, they would also leave the APC.
	?We don?t want to take responsibility of placing the country in a trap by taking part in the APC. If the government continues to tighten the grip on Sri Lanka in an international trap, we will leave the APC,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Sampath Bank social responsibility feted as best in the country
	
Sampath Bank, renowned as a responsible corporate citizen, was yet again duly honoured for its genuine efforts when the bank clinched the Gold award in the category of CSR Brand of the Year at the recently concluded SLIM Brand Excellence Award Ceremony held at the BMICH.?
This award recognized Sampath Bank?s continuous efforts in giving back to society that have profoundly contributed towards the overall development of social wellbeing in Sri Lanka.?
SLIM Brand Excellence is a flagship event in the country?s corporate calendar, conducted by the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM).?
Sampath Bank was extended with this award for its entrepreneur development programme ?Sampath Saviya?. Through the programme, the bank substantially empowered micro, small and medium-scale entrepreneurs (MSMEs) with knowledge and skills in addition to providing financial support. It is the recognition of this unique philosophy and its unprecedented model of execution that resulted in the receipt of the CSR Brand of the Year Gold awards at SLIM Brand Excellence Award 2015.?
Launched in 2013, Sampath Saviya focusses on groups of MSMEs selected from different regions and develops their potential in a multitude of ways thus enabling them to become successful entrepreneurs. To this end, the bank conducts a series of three-day workshops with the selected entrepreneurs and trains them in important areas such as human resource management, administration and business planning in addition to enhancing their financial literacy. In addition to placing a special emphasis on the identification of women entrepreneurs Sampath Saviya also monitors the execution of the entrepreneur?s business plans for a period of two years, making sure that the bank steps in when support is needed.
Since its inception, three years ago, the Sampath Saviya has delivered on its promise by uplifting the lives of more than 1,000 families across the island. The systematic development of entrepreneurs targeted by the programme has already shown immense success with many of the beneficiaries having shown significant success in their businesses.?
One of the most notable of such entrepreneurs K.P. Lalith Nandika from Buttala had started ?Shakya Herbals?, his own business of unique herbal products way back in 2002. However, Nandika was able to turn the tables around and reach success when he enrolled for the Sampath Saviya in 2014.?
M.L.R.K. Senaratne, another entrepreneur who benefitted from Sampath Saviya, is an acclaimed inventor whose dream to market his inventions was made a reality through Sampath Saviya. Senaratne, whose inventive products were mainly home appliances, had been struggling to convert his passion into a successful business until he was introduced to Sampath Saviya by Sri Lanka New Inventor?s Commission in 2014.
Commenting on this recognition, Tharaka Ranwala, Deputy General Manager Marketing and Business Development and overall pillar head of CSR, Sampath Bank said, ?As a socially responsible corporate citizen, Sampath Bank always identifies the need to empower the lives of Sri Lankans. Sampath Saviya? CSR project aims to empower SMEs who are essentially the backbone of our country?s economy. We are indeed proud that our constant investment in social improvement has been recognized on such a prestigious platform and are profoundly motivated to continue our efforts to make Sri Lanka a more developed nation.?
