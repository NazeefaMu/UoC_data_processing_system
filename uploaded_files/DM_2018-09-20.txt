A President Under Threat
	
One of Sirisenas prime concerns these days is to seek solutions to the post war issues
The alleged revealing of an assassination plot on President Maithripala Sirisena and former military official now turned politician Gotabaya Rajapaksa has given the Government authorities and the defence establishment plenty to think about the security of VIPs and the countrys citizens. 
The alleged revelation is directly linked to those who are engaged in drug peddling. The person who made the revelation has said that the would be assassin (Not named yet) wanted to bump off Sirisena and Gotabaya because the duo are against the drug trade. This threat could also severely hamper Sirisenas movements in public in the run up to the elections. 
A prominent feature about Sirisena is his ability to accommodate the ideas of others
	One of Sirisenas prime concerns these days is to seek solutions to the post war issues
	sirisena is readying himself to submit a set of special proposals to the UNHRC
In the context of elections, this could be a master plan by someone who wishes to stifle the president. Sirisena is someone who moves freely with the crowd. Seeing the president mingle with people could have the effect of throwing sand in the eyes of those who oppose him as the ruler of this nation. The same analysis is applicable to Gotabaya who has given rise to so much speculation in being one of the next presidential candidates. The Premier speaking in Parliament quite rightly said that Gota should be provided with security if he makes a request, but added that no one should try to gain political advantages from this incident. 
As much as Gotabaya wishes to showcase himself as a future president, Sirisena has shown the desire to be reelected to the top seat in politics. It is no secret that there are some politicians who have links with the drug trade. So the would be assassin of the these two political figures perhaps represents a drug-dealing community which wishes to have a president wholl allow such nefarious activities to continue. 
Given the talk about assassinations, in a hypothetical sense and with all respect to the first citizen of this country, could this writer pose this question; is this the time toassassinate Sirisena 
The alleged revealing of an assassination plot on President Maithripala Sirisena and former military official now turned politician Gotabaya Rajapaksa has given the Government authorities and the defence establishment plenty to think about the security of VIPs and the countrys citizens. 
In 2015 the country voted in Sirisena as president, largely to appose Mahinda Rajapaksa and not because of any proven credentials Sirisena possessed. A prominent feature about Sirisena is his ability to accommodate the ideas of others. The current president agreed to restrict the term of a president to two terms, through the 19th Amendment, and is also said to be in agreement with the contents in the proposed 20th Amendment; which will see much of the powers of the president being taken away and the premiers portfolio in parliament being strengthened. 
A balanced man
We also see the premier exercising much power and engaging in the task of forging ties with other nations and building business bridges. 
Wickramasinghe has always been skilled in forging international relations and striking deals which are beneficial to the country. Sirisena has allowed the premier to engage in such talks and most importantly offered the opportunities to Wickramasinghe to work on his strengths. If we have seen the best of Wickramasinghe we have seen it during the Yahapalana regime. His biggest victory in politics came when he survived a no-confidence motion which was movedagainst him. 
President Sirisena has a balance when executing his duties as the head of state. He has given the minorities the opportunities to safeguard their status in the country. After being sworn into power he has worked closely with India, the super power of South Asia. The Yahapalana regime, under Sirisena, has allowed India to build houses in the north and the Central Provinces. It wouldnt be an exaggeration if this writer states that this nation has a president who possesses the ability to work even with the devil! 
One of Sirisenas prime concerns these days is to seek solutions to the post war issues. There is a threat of economic sanctions being imposed on Sri Lanka by the UNHRC. This is following an initiation taken by the Tamil Nadu Government urging the Government of India to move a resolution against Sri Lanka in connection with issues related to the war, that concluded. In response to this the president is readying himself to submit a set of special proposals to the UNHRC Commissioner on September 25. 
A friendly India would always ensure that Sri Lanka has a neighbour who doesnt rock her boat, in terms of peace. This is why two highly ambitious members of the Rajapaksa family made a recent visit to India and met Premier Narendra Modi
President Sirisena is quite aware of the importance of forging healthy ties with India. A friendly India would always ensure that Sri Lanka has a neighbour who doesnt rock her boat, in terms of peace. This is why two highly ambitious members of the Rajapaksa family made a recent visit to India and met Premier Narendra Modi. For the record the Tamil Community voting against Rajapaksa at the last presidential elections was hugely influenced by an Indian factor. 
Indias support
At present the relationship between Modi and Sirisena is well cemented. India has already pledged support to develop ports and aviation facilities in Sri Lanka. If a quick comparison is made regarding the relationship between the two nations during the Rajapaksa regime and Yahapalana Government, the latter has been preferred by India. This is because Sirisena has allowed a larger Indian presence in Sri Lanka compared to what Rajapaksa did, which was the opposite. One cant blame Sirisena for the stance taken in forging relations with India because the Indian Ocean Region is set to define the destiny of the planet in the 21st century. 
At the time of writing, the Sri Lankan President is alive and kicking despite the talk of assassination attempts on him. A close analysis of this death threat on the president makes us wonder whether anyone who was privy to the plan would spell out everything to the police given that he would later encounter untold problems. Whats alarming is that a high-ranking Police official is also privy to this alleged assassination plot. It seems that these efforts have been made to shake up the president in making him lose focus of the important task at hand; which is preparing for the run-up to the upcoming elections. 
Drug peddling and trafficking have continued for so long despite tight security measures being taken to control such activities. Even if Sirisena opposes drug peddling and wishes to reimpose the death penalty on those who deal with drugs, these narcotics would be freely available in this island. The only hassle would be to find the green notes which give one the buying power topurchase them. 
Sirisena has committed few or no errors during his tenure as president, given the financial situation the country is in. The only fault in the president, as Mahinda Rajapaksa has pointed out, is his habit of going to sleep by 10 oclock in the night.

The partnership will run from 2021 through to 2028.

The ambition of both partners is to use the power of sport to connect with new audiences via digital channels, including the Olympic Channel. Engaging with the next generation in their preferred way gives Allianz the opportunity to cover their insurance needs.

Allianz will also continue its strong partnership with the International Paralympic Committee (IPC), building on more than a decade of success.

Allianz has built a global business founded on trust. With this partnership, together we are building a foundation based on mutual trust. Allianz also has a strong sporting heritage and, in line with the Olympic Agenda 2020, we share a digital ambition of connecting with young people around the world to promote the Olympic values and the power of sport.

Allianz CEO Oliver Bte said: I am thrilled that we are joining a global community of athletes and people enthusiastic about sport and team work  in addition to our existing strong partnership with the International Paralympic Committee (IPC). Through the IOCs digital and social channels, we can connect with more people than ever before and offer them our expertise in insurance. We believe the world is a better place when people have the courage to leave differences behind and stand together to achieve better outcomes for themselves and for the societies they live in.

Tsunekazu Takeda, the IOCs Marketing Commission Chair, said: We are delighted to announce this new partnership with one of the worlds leading companies in its field, and we look forward to beginning a new, exciting journey together.

Jean-Marc Pailhol, Head of Group Market Management and Distribution at Allianz SE, added: As a world-leading insurer, Allianz is directly embedded in all the great events which make and transform our global society. That is why becoming the Worldwide TOP Partner in the insurance category of the IOC and the IPC is important for us. We will work together to take both teams to the next level  digitally, commercially and globally. Were excited about the opportunity to move Allianz into new markets, as well as strengthening our position in existing territories. Together with the IOC and the IPC, this is a perfect way to share our passion for sport and the social, physical and mental benefits it brings to humanity.

The sponsorship period will cover the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022, the Olympic Games Paris 2024, the Olympic Winter Games 2026 and the Olympic Games LA 2028. In China, France and Spain, Allianz will already have marketing rights from 2019 onwards.

In March 2018, the IOC and IPC established a long-term partnership between the two organisations through to 2032. As part of this agreement, from 2021 onwards all Worldwide TOP Partners will also be Partners of the IPC and the Paralympic Games.

Former in charge of the Terrorist Investigation Division (TID) DIG Nalaka de Silva, against whom allegations had been levelled over his alleged plot to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, had connections with the LTTE, the National Freedom Front charged today.
Addressing a news briefing, NFF National Organizer Jayantha Samaraweera said they had evidence to prove that DIG Silva had had close relationships with LTTE personnel in Chavakachcheri among whom some of them still have contacts with the DIG.
Namal Kumara who is a reliable spy attached to the Sri Lanka Police recently leaked a phone conversation, which was reported to have had with DIG Nalaka Silva, where he has revealed facts related to a conspiracy to assassinate Maithripala Sirisena and Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Samaraweera said.
When the evidence is clear, we cant fathom as to why the Governmnt is not active to take any legal action against Nalaka Silva, he added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

While stressing that he is still capable and fit enough to play cricket, Sri Lanka's legendary cricketer Tillakaratne Dilshan said today he was ready and willing to contribute for the welfare of Sri Lankan cricket either as a player or a consultant considering the continuous struggle of the current Sri Lankan cricket team.
Responding to speculations circulating in the social media hinting of his comeback to International Cricket, he told the Daily Mirror that he was ready to return to the Sri Lanka cricket team if Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) or the Ministry of Sports requested him.
I continue to play my domestic cricket. Hence, it is not a challenge for me to return to the international side again, Dilshan said.
I always think of my country. I presume I did my best in cricket prior to my retirement. However, I am of the opinion that I should do something more for my country, Dilshan added.
Dilshan last played for the Sri Lankan side (in ODIs) on August 28, 2016.
Despite speculation that he wanted to play until the 2019 World-cup, due to certain issues, he had to retire earlier. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Lentil as Anything How one Sri Lankan man created a community
     	 
  At the Daily Mirror, we believe that climate change is one of the greatest threats that we, as Sri Lankans, will face in the future.  Therefore, we intend to provide our readers with local and international content with the objective to educate and inspire. We would also like to learn from our valued readers about any ongoing initiatives in making Sri Lanka a more sustainable nation.   
 We aim to explore sustainable ways of living that have the most positive impact on not just our natural environment, but also for humans and animals.  
While topics such as global warming, pollution, and inequality are confronting, we believe it's time the media stopped shying away from these issues and became an active participant in finding solutions - and we hope you will join us. 
     
				 		 
	
	

Imagine a restaurant where individuals of different heritage, age, ethical food preference, religion and income can all enjoy a meal together without having to worry about how they are going to afford it Too good to be true It should be, but one man has done absolutely that - Shanaka Fernando, a Sri Lankan that has been living in Melbourne since leaving Sri Lanka many years ago after failing his Ordinary Level examinations.

With a catchy restaurant title Lentil As Anything (a play on words of the famous Aussie band Mental As Anything) and four locations across Australia, the premise of the restaurant is Food Without Borders  meaning that everyone should have access to a healthy meal, in a safe, warm environment with the added bonus of getting to know others in your community that you may not normally come into contact with. 
Over the last 18 years Shanaka has certainly achieved this. Lentil As Anything has provided 41 million meals to people from an ever changing a la carte menu or a lunch buffet with all the food being vegetarian/vegan in keeping with the ethos of taking care of everyone, including animals and the environment. 

With any restaurant venture there is a risk financially but taking that a step further and having a pay what you feel restaurant thats fully independent and receives no Government or external funding is an even bigger challenge

Lentil As Anything doesnt market itself as a vegetarian restaurant so as to appeal to a wide array of people who are usually very surprised that they sat down to such a filling, delicious meal that was all veg! There are handy guides located in the restaurants to explain the payment structure with the suggested amount you can contribute and how your money will fund the restaurant. Even if you are unable to contribute financially there are many other ways to pay for your meal such as volunteering. The Daily Mirror spoke to the brains behind the restaurants, Shanaka, about what inspired him to start such a venture. 
I was most provoked by the people of Sri Lanka during my growing up years. An unconditional form of generosity that cut through the class divides stood out against the backdrop of war and social injustice. People smiled, gave warmth and love despite everything indicating a state of impoverishment he advised. After three years of living in Australia, I spent six years with tribal societies in the forest experiencing the happiness that a simple life of feeling brings. This is why I came back to Melbourne and started a pay as you feel restaurant, he said. 
Considering that 60% of restaurants in Australia close within the first year, its a testament to Shanaka and the team that theyve created a sustainable business model thats successful. One of the issues they face is dishonesty among visitors. If restaurant goers follow the price guidelines it should balance out, the person at the table next to you may only be able to contribute $2, but if you can afford $20 then your small gesture of kindness has funded someone less fortunate and that is sure to make you feel good inside (and not just from the yummy food!). 

Lentil as Anything also has a strong volunteer component with at least some 1000 volunteers helping out per year. Many people help out in the kitchen to pay for their meal due to limited income

Shanaka hasnt just stopped at creating these super popular restaurants. Lentils As Anything also offers a vegan catering service in Melbourne. Theres the Urban Garden collective with locations in Melbourne which gives the community a chance to bring together their skills to grow food not only for themselves but also for the restaurants to make the business as sustainable as possible and to cut down on food miles as well as unnecessary plastic packaging.
Another brainchild of Shanaka is the Food Rescue Program. Volunteers collect good quality food that would normally be thrown out due to cosmetic reasons or dented packaging. By connecting with local businesses, farmers markets, supermarkets and bakeries this food is used in the Lentil as Anythings kitchens and the brand new Inconvenience Store the very first pay as you feel supermarket in Victoria (the concept has already been successful in Toronto). Run completely on donated and rescued plant-based food, it gives those who can afford to pay a bit extra, which in turn will help out those in the community that dont have access to healthy foods. Donations to the supermarket will also go towards their overheads such as transport, storage and bills. 
We asked Shanaka if he thought a concept like this could work in Sri Lanka Absolutely! Outside of its confused and corrupted urban culture is the heart and conscience of the country in Sri Lankas rural population which is still in the majority. These people would instinctively embrace a trust-based enterprise as its basically an ongoing dansala Shanaka said. 
As countries develop you see them move away from a village community model where people shared resources with each other and protected those who were vulnerable. Whereas developed countries are noticing that this impersonal form of society with such a rampant use of technology is actually creating loneliness and isolation. We asked Shanaka if he thinks we can get back to a community that supports and cares for each other. Shanaka thinks it is possible I have given up my mobile phone and live relatively tech free and am moving towards abandoning all forms of it. Its a toxic distraction from the essence of life. Europe is progressing rapidly into a village based value system that focuses on people connecting with each other in person, eating in a way that recognizes our custodianship of the environment which many Sri Lankans are already way ahead of in these aspects. 
Lentil as Anything also has a strong volunteer component with at least some 1000 volunteers helping out per year. Many people help out in the kitchen to pay for their meal due to limited income. Asylum seekers without English skills are able to get an opportunity for work experience and to learn English and Lentil as Anything has had volunteers from all over the world. Sufferers of mental and physical conditions who may be prevented from working full time are able to work in supportive environment, free from judgement. Its not just the vulnerable, there are many young people volunteering who just want to get experience in the hospitality industry in an environment thats positive and friendly. Although each outlet can serve thousands of meals a day, interviews with the staff show they really enjoy their work and the friendships and support systems they form with each other. The restaurants also serve as a space for local artists, musicians, and writers to express themselves through performances and exhibitions.
With such a diverse range of people coming through the restaurants we asked Shanaka if he recently had any of those feel good moments which reaffirm that he was on the right path. Recently we received a hand-written letter from the parents of a longstanding regular patron named Ben. It read as you know, our son Ben suffers from schizophrenia and has struggled to make friends or support himself independently. You have not only provided him a place to have a regular and nutritious meal, but also an opportunity to feel part of an extended family and a nurturing community. Please accept this donation as a sign of our gratitude Included was a cheque for $2000. 
While its evident from Shanakas years of helping people that he seems to have found the key to happiness we asked him what his secret is for living a healthy and happy life
Live simple
'' Be true to yourself 
Open yourself out to the people around you
Life is not a convenience store
Its more like an inconvenience store
Honor the great unknown that we inherit and push yourself to discover new experiences everyday
Your body is your temple and resum 
Treat it with respect''

Let us become channels of peace
	
Tomorrow is the United Nations World Day of Peace and we all need to be channels of peace though the big powers like the United States, while talking of peace, provide bombs to the Saudi Arabia led coalition which recently dropped one such bomb, killing scores of schoolchildren in Yemen. 
Each year the International Day of Peace is observed around the world on September 21. The UN General Assembly has declared this as a day devoted to strengthening the ideals of peace, both within and among all nations and people. The UN member states adopted the 17 Sustainable Development Goals in 2015 because they understood that it would not be possible to build a peaceful world if steps were not taken to achieve economic and social development for all people everywhere, and ensure that their rights were protected. The Sustainable Goals cover a broad range of issues, including poverty, hunger, health, education, climate change, gender equality, water, sanitation, energy, environment and social justice,the UN says. 
The theme for 2018 is The Right to Peace - The Universal Declaration of Human Rights at 70. The theme celebrates the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights - a milestone document in the history of human rights. Drafted by representatives with different legal and cultural backgrounds from all regions of the world, the Declaration was adopted by the UN General Assembly in Paris on December 10, 1948 as a common standard of achievement for all people and all nations. The Universal Declaration  the most translated document in the world, available in more than 500 languages is as relevant today as it was on the day it was adopted.
UN Secretary-General Antnio Guterres in a message to mark the event says It is time all nations and all people live up to the words of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which recognizes the inherent dignity and equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human race. This year marks the 70th anniversary of that landmark document. 
The Universal Declaration states in Article 3 Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person. These elements build the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world. Yet, the Universal Declaration does not include a separate article on Right to Peace. This is why the UN is asking the people this year What does The Right to Peace mean to you The UN urges people to share their views through #peaceday and #standup4humanright.
The UN Chief says this foundational document is a reminder that peace takes root when people are free from hunger, poverty and oppression and can thrive and prosper. With the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as our guide, we must ensure the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. I encourage you to speak up, for gender equality, for inclusive societies and for climate action. Do your part at school, at work, at home. Every stepcounts, he says. 
In Sri Lanka, President Maithripala Sirisena was elected to office in January 2015, with his rainbow coalitions main pledge being to restore sustainable peace by bringing about religious and racial unity in diversity. It is significant that President Sirisena won mainly because the majority of minority communities voted for him. After the August 2015 Parliamentary elections, the Presidents Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the United National Party which played a major role in bringing him to office pledged their priority would be racial and religious unity in diversity. But some three years and nine months after the historic election of January 8, some progress has been made towards interracial and interreligious unity in diversity but much more needs to be done. 
Party politicians will be party politicians for their personal gain or glory with bribery or corruption being rampant before January 2015 and even now. Therefore we urge the people to mark world peace day by making a pledge to make me a channel of peace, where there is hatred, let me bring love, where there is offence, let me bring pardon, where there is discord, let me bring union, where there is error, let me bring truth, where there is despair, let me bring hope, where there is darkness, let me bring light, where there is sadness, let me bring joy.

Ministry mulls holding O/L, A/L exams in December
	
The Education Ministry said discussions are underway to hold the G.C.E. Ordinary Level and Advanced Level Examinations in December and to release their results by the end of December before the start of the new school term.
Speaking to the media at the Ministry, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said after the end of the A/L examinations, the University entrance will commence and after the O/L examinations the A/L classes will begin in January.
Preparations for changing the examination dates would be done after discussions with the Department of Examinations. The Ministry is planning to save the childrens waiting time for the examinations and to help the children to get their degrees and post graduate degrees at the age of 25 years. Due to the late issuance of exam results, Advanced Level students are not in a position to apply for foreign university programmes, the minister said.
Thus, he had instructed the Examination Commissioner General to issue the results on fixed dates.
Earlier the Education Ministry had issued fixed dates for the release of Grade Five Scholarship Examination, the G.C.E. Ordinary Level Examination and the G.C.E Advance Level examination results each year.
Accordingly, the release dates of examination results are as follows: G.C.E. A/L on December 27, G.C.E. O/L on March 28 and Grade Five Scholarship exam on October 5. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Modi, MR break new ground regarding relations
	
The meeting between Premier Modi and Mahinda Rajapaksa in India is said to have laid the foundation for goodwill between them
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksas one-on-one meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has sparked fresh political debate both in Sri Lanka and India. It is more so because the 40-minute closed door discussion took place at Panchavati or the Prime Ministers official residence in New Delhi amidst perception in Sri Lanka that Indias Research and Analysis (RAW) played a clandestine role in 2015 in the installation of the present Government by unseating Rajapaksa from office. 
It is true that only Sri Lankan people voted out Rajapaksa. Be that as it may, the perception here is that the RAW played a role, particularly by ensuring the support of the Tamil political parties based in the north and the east, and the upcountry, to make President Maithripala Sirisena the common candidate at the 2015 Presidential Elections. 
In fact, President Sirisena was clad like Modi during the election campaign. It was interpreted as a move to make a symbolic psychological appeal to Tamil voters who are emotionally attached to India because they have their origins there. However, all these are matters with scope for interpretation inmultiple ways. 
Instead of engaging in a hair-splitting theorising exercise, it is worth to get down to facts in analysing Indo-Lanka ties in the current context. 
The key figures who served in the Rajapaksa Government admitted openly during their public interactions and media interviews after the 2015 electoral defeat that they enjoyed healthy relations with India during the height of war, but they were soured after the Modi Government assumed office in May, 2014. That was at the tail end of the Rajapaksa regime. 
The delegation was accorded accommodation at Le Mridien Hotel in New Delhi. Besides, a bullet-proof vehicle from the fleet assigned to Modi had been deployed to transport Rajapaksa
There is reference to the troika mechanism established at that time to sort out outstanding bilateral issues related to the war efforts here. 
In fact, the Troika mechanism is viewed as a real topic for a case study for students pursuing international relations as their major. It involved the key officials of both sides. Former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa, former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa and former Presidential Secretary Lalith Weeratunga comprised the Troika representing Sri Lanka. 
The Indian Trokia consisted of then Indian Foreign Secretary Shivshankar Menon, former National Security Advisor M.K. Narayan and former Defence Secretary Vijay Singh. 
Menon published a book Choices fleshing out details as to how the troika mechanism worked in the interests of both countries and the war being brought to a successful end. 
In an interview with this columnist, after the book was published, Menon said, I think the book makes it clear that we had a professional, productive and good working relationship with our Sri Lankan counterparts and interlocutors. The troika mechanism which we started to deal with sensitive and urgent issues, in particular, worked well and showed consistent results. 
Basil Rajapaksa also confirmed it in a similar interview. All in all, it is a known fact the Rajapaksa administration had good relations with India at one point. It is also a fact that such relations soured later during his term. 
The Modi-Rajapaksa dialogue has to be viewed through the prism of these developments only. Rajapaksa was in New Delhi to deliver a public lecture on India-Sri Lanka relation: the way ahead organised by the Virat Hindustan Sangam, led by BJP MP Subramanian Swamy. 
On the sidelines of it, Rajapaksa, and his entourage- that included his son MP Namal Rajapaksa, Kandy district MP Lohan Ratwatte and former External Affairs Minister prof. G.L. Peiris- met with the leaders of both the ruling Bharatiya Janatha Party(BJP) and the main opposition Indian National Congress, led by Rahul Gandhi. With Modi the dialogue was one-one-one. 
In his speech, Rajapaksa referred to Menons book Choices and said eradication of terrorism in Sri Lanka was an immense advantage to India as well
The two leaders decided not to divulge what was discussed. The only official line communicated was that the interaction laid down the foundation for goodwill between them. 
Prof. Peiris, who accompanied Rajapaksa, said it was for warming of ties. The rapport is now built, he said. 
Modi also referred to his friendship with Rajapaksa saying that it even preceded his becoming the Prime Minister of India. 
In this manner, India is obviously reaching out to Rajapaksa. May be, it is that India has sensed how the political wind is blowing in Sri Lanka. Accordingly, it may be trying to adjust its relations with him. 
Whatever it might be, it sent a strong message to the Sri Lankan political parties and politicians. It is learned that none of the controversial issues such as the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) and the leasing out of the Mattala Airport and the Trincomalee Oil Tank, were touched upon. So, it is purely an attempt to break new ground in terms of relations. 
The delegation was accorded accommodation at Le Mridien Hotel in New Delhi. Besides, a bullet-proof vehicle from the fleet assigned to Modi had been deployed to transport Rajapaksa. Besides, the Indian Government had informed the Sri Lankan High Commission in New Delhi that it would be ready to grant any form of assistance if required in respect of this visit. 
Rahul on economic themes and election campaigns
Besides, the delegation also met with the Congress leaders that included Rahul Gandhi, former Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh and Opposition Leader Anand Sharma. 
According to political sources, Gandhi, who is supposed to spearhead the Congress, said that the Indian society had been gripped by issues triggered after demonetisation, the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax and farmers issues. In his remarks, he tried to draw a parallel with Sri Lanka, and said that the economic themes would dominate the election campaigns of both the countries. 
Tamil Nadu MPs at dinner hostedfor MR
Alongside, Menon hosted a dinner in honour of Rajapaksa in New Delhi. On behalf of the BJP-led Indian Government, Minister Maneka Gandhi was also present at the event. Interestingly, some MPs from Tamil Nadu were also present at the event and were mingling with the invitees at the dinner. 
Actually, it was inconceivable some time ago to expect Tamil Nadu MPs at events attended by Rajapaksa. In the past, in fact, there were public protests when he visited India. There was exception this time. 
Menon was seated near the main table at the dinner function and spent two or three minutes talking to each member of the delegation. In his speech, Rajapaksa referred to Menons book Choices and said eradication of terrorism in Sri Lanka was an immense advantage to India as well. 
Menon, in his casual interaction, said he divided his time between India and the United States. He has undertaken some teaching assignments in the United States under afellowship programme. 
In this manner, India is obviously reaching out to Rajapaksa. May be, it is that India has sensed how the political wind is blowing in Sri Lanka. Accordingly, it may be trying to adjust its relations with him
Douglas seeks Indias support
Simultaneously with the visit by Rajapaksa, a Sri Lankan parliamentary delegation- headed by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya- was in New Delhi on a familiarisation tour at the invitation of the Indian Government. 
Modi held formal talks with this delegation which comprised MP Vijitha Herath of the JVP, Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan, EPDP leader Douglas Devananda, Ministers Mano Ganeshan and Rauff Hakeem. Secretary General of Parliament, Dammika Dasanayake was also present. 
Both Jayasuriya and Modi addressed the meeting engaging in diplomatic talk. Then, each member of the delegation was accorded timeto speak. 
Devananda had three suggestions to make to the Indian leader- to develop flight connectivity between Jaffna and various Indian cities, the expansion of the 50,000 housing scheme launched by India in the north and the east and a political solution based on the 13th Amendment tothe Constitution. 
Sampanthan stressed the need to evolve a political solution and cited the current juncture as the most opportune time for it. He said it should not be missed. 
Hakeem sought Indias assistance for the development of railways in the eastern province of Sri Lanka. 
This interaction was not in the limelight as such because the attention of Indian media was focused more on Rajapaksas visit. 
Sajith, others clash at Cabinet over CoL
The Cabinet of Ministers met on Tuesday as usual with President Sirisena in the chair. The topic of cost of living was discussed at great length. 
Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa struck a note of criticism on the soaring cost of living, but he was confronted by his Cabinet colleagues in this regard. 
Let alone, Premadasa remained in his conviction that the prices of essential items were sky high. 
If you talk to ten people on the road, nine of them will say that the cost of living is high. If you prove otherwise, I will retract my remarks, he said. 
President Sirisena too agreedwith Premadasa. 
Ministers Malik Samarawickrama said Kabir Hashim viewed that the prices of some items such as rice had been stabilised, but there was scant media coverage for it.

My involvement in peoples struggles delayed  my wedding
	
Everybody had been eager to comment on the wedding of Chathura Senarathne. This wedding was celebrated at Temple Trees. Chathura has become a controversial character in the political arena in the recent past. The followingare excerpts of aninterview Lanka Deepahad with him.

This was an event where Trade Unionists, Civil Society members, Farmers and workers participated
	I wish to remind those who make allegations against me that I have settled all bills
	Under this Government the health Services developed remarkably
	In addition to the number of hours Temple Trees was reserved by me, I paid for every additional hour at the rate of Rs 80,000, and in full settlement I have paid Rs2.180,000
	As the wedding couple even we did not take to the floor to dance
	The Civil society representing all 25 districts were invited for this wedding
	The food, decorations, chairs and tables were all brought from outside by us
	I am happy that I was able to treat, even in a small manner, the large crowd who helped me
Q There were many who spoke about Chathura Senarathnes wedding celebrated with much fanfare. How was it made possible 
This was not a Royal wedding, but I think the place where it was held at created all this fuss. This was an event attended by the people from the lowest rungs of the society and those in the higher echelons.
This was an event where Trade Unionists, Civil Society members, Farmers and workers participated. It was a wedding where a large number of people close to me participated in. Now everybody is worried about this wedding being held at Temple Trees.
If I had celebrated it at Hilton or Shangri-La no one would be bothered and no one would have made any comments. If that happened all that money would have gone to the hotel. I paid much more than I would have had to pay the hotels in order to reserve Temple Trees. 
There is no regulation stipulating that the weddings of only selective people can be celebrated here. Anyone can state his genuine reasons and after making the required payments obtain it.
Q Why were you so crazy about having the wedding at Temple Trees 
There were many who joined hands with us at the 2015 January 08th Elections. I wanted the majority of these people invited for my great day in life. My request was considered by the Prime Minister who allowed me to use Temple Trees. I wish to remind all those who make allegations against me that I have settled all bills up to the very cent. These bills could be made available for anyones perusal. In addition to the number of hours Temple Trees was reserved by me, I paid for every additional hour at the rate of Rs 80,000, and in full settlement I have paid Rs 2.180,000. This place can accommodate a large crowd and after I justified my reasons for holding the event there I was able to obtain it. I am happy that I was able to treat, even in a small manner, the large crowd who helped me. 

Q What made the Prime Minister heed your request and allowed you to celebrate the wedding at Temple Trees 
When I spoke to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and presented my reasons, he gave his approval. Thereafter his secretary did the coordinating. My letter of request addressed to the Prime Minister was not sent under my official letterhead. The Civil society representing all 25 districts were invited for this wedding. Initially I stated that all charges due under the circulars and the cost of time spent on prearrangements would be reimbursed. 

Q What were your justifiable reasons in obtaining Temple Trees to celebrate your wedding 
As an individual mingling with the people and as a leader who represents the two most largest Civil Societies and my invitations to these people and the keenness of many others to attend this function were all highlighted. The Prime Minister was aware of how we risked our lives in order to win the struggle on January 08. Therefore the Prime Minister decided and I should have this venue. We only got the reception hall from Temple Trees. The food, decorations, chairs and tables were all brought from outside by us. 

Q Can anyone obtain the Temple Trees bungalow to celebrate a wedding like the way you did 
There is no regulation stipulating that the weddings of only selective people can be celebrated here. Anyone can state his genuine reasons and after making the required payments obtain it. The main requirement is that the dignity of this place should always be maintained at the highest level. We observed it to the very letter. There cannot be activities like those that are witnessed at other hotels. As the wedding couple even we did not take to the floor to dance. The celebration was completely devoid of any alcohol. Anyone may be able to obtain this place by observing its rules and regulations. The state too earns revenue from this. 
This reception hall was sometime back taken care of by the Navy due to want of maintenance. The Dansalas (Places where free meals are given) that were conducted here during the previous Government are not there now. Therefore it needs regular maintenance. Our wedding generated the highest income to the Government as a result of us using this venue. I am happy that I was able help the Government earn this income through my wedding because otherwise these monies would have gone to either Hilton or Shangri-La. 
Our wedding generated the highest income to the Government as a result of we using this venue. I am happy that I was able help the Government earn this income
Q As an MP and a civil society leader didnt you think that without spending so much money to celebrate a wedding it would have been better to have done some social welfare work instead 
My involvement in civil society work and the struggle of the people delayed my wedding. I am a youth who postponed my wedding during the past 11 years. I sacrificed it for the welfare of the people and country. I am a person who is deeply involved in the welfare of the people and on the great day of my life what was more important was to be with those who were close to me. 
All the expenses incurred at my wedding were those which were necessary. My closest associates provided me with the other important requirements. There were also contributions made by my wifes party. 

Q Having criticised the previous Government of conducting Dansalas at Temple Trees, you celebrated the wedding at the same place. there are several others who are levelling charges against you. 
All those who made allegations had to backtrack when I produced all bills and receipts. During Mahinda Rajapaksas time there were many weddings registered and celebrated here. Even the expense for the milk rice that was served at those receptions was borne by the state. These facts were revealed by Lasantha Wickramatunga at that time. The cost of wedding receptions held at te Temple Trees was never borne by the couples. The peoples money was lavishly spent. We did not resort to such practices. If I had requested I could have got this place free of charge, but we did not do that. Mahinda Rajapaksas sons have no right to criticise me. We did not make Temple Trees a mad house by having a reception where liquor was served. We know what exactly took place here during those days. 

Q After your wedding party at Temple Trees the Prime Minister has now said that Temple Trees would not be given for future weddings. 
Yes. It would have been made clear that the dignified manner in which we held our function would not be observed by another party. There is also a possibility of some unscrupulous persons reserving this place and creating a situation that would endanger the security and the dignity of this place. If that happens then the Prime Minister would get the bad name. 
The state too earns revenue from this. This reception hall was sometime back taken care of by the Navy due to want of maintenance
Q Isnt it unjust that the opportunity you got is being denied to others in the country
If someone else also makes the required payments and makes a justifiable request to have the celebrations in a dignified manner, he or she might get this venue. It is true that depriving them of such an opportunity would create injustice. This is something the Prime Minister and the relevant authorities should decide on. However if there is no arrangement to invite a large crowd like I did, there appears to be no point in reserving this venue because there is an alternative of reserving a reputed hotel in Colombo. The latter is a better proposition. The cost would also be lower. 

Q Your father and Mahinda Rajapaksa were very close. How is that they were not invited for your wedding
Based on a principle only a few respectable individuals from the Joint Opposition were invited. Likewise individuals from the ruling party whose names have been mentioned for being involved in frauds and corruption were not invited. Please remember that for our wedding only 22 relatives were invited and the rest were all ordinary people of the country. 
During Mahinda Rajapaksas time there were many weddings registered and celebrated here. Even the expense for the milk rice that was served at those receptions was borne by the state.
Q Though you maintain that on principle the JO members were not invited, members of Wimal Weerawansas family are close friends of your parents. Why were they overlooked
There is no reason for me to invite Wimal Weerawansa. A person like Wimal Weerawansa, who possesses two Passports, is not wanted at my wedding or even at my funeral. I am going to write in my last will not to welcome such type of fraudsters to my funeral house. Wimal Weerawansas wife had a close association with my mother for some years. The wedding was a private affair and my father or mother never intervened in covering up their fraudulent acts. But there are some holding the highest positions in this Government who helped Wimal Weerawansa. We know who called the Airport and instructed not to take them into custody. There is no point in mentioning his name. We showed our opposition to this type of favouritism and made agitations. People are aware of it. 

Q Your father was honoured as Suwapathi, but there are hospitals in the country which do not have basic medicine. 
Do not say that. Under this Government the health Services developed remarkably. But when taken as a whole there are deficiencies, a fact which I accept. It is our concern to minimize such shortcomings and establish a superior health service in the country, which is our responsibility. 
If I had requested I could have got this place free of charge, but we did not do that. Mahinda Rajapaksas sons have no right to criticise me. We did not make Temple Trees a mad house by having a reception where liquor was served.
Q Your father organised a grand show at Nelum Pokuna to celebrate the occasion of receiving the Suwapathi award.Your comments
Winning such an award was not something easy. International fame was won for the work that was done. It is not necessary to organise such shows in our country to commemorate these events. I also think that it was quite unnecessary. Winning the award was a great achievement though.

## Title: Notes for a Manifesto: Reconciliation

Notes for a Manifesto: Reconciliation
	
There are words and terms that get bastardized due to improper usage, over-use and association with error, political noxiousness and flippancy. Reconciliation is one which has some currency in this regard and perhaps is second only to yahapalanaya (good governance). In a different time we had peace. Even seemingly benign and indeed wholesome terms such as sustainability have suffered the natural and sad consequences of being hijacked and re-defined to mean the exact opposite of the original meaning. 
And so we have yahapalanaya as a cuss word and we have reconciliation as a joke. Nevertheless good governance is and will always be a wholesome project while reconciliation is something this country needs to obtain as a non-negotiable for progress of any kind. 
Reconciliation, in its current usage, refers to unresolved issues among communities. These include all manner of grievances which include threat, vulnerability, inequality and other citizenship-anomalies. Whether they are real or perceived is another matter that also needs to be addressed because claims need to be substantiated and aspirations less than ridiculous given current realities. 
We dont have a happy starting point apart from the fact that theres no armed conflict right now. The absence of war helps. However, the lack of will on all fronts to be rational, desist from selectivity in citing history and a predisposition to let the political prerogatives of the moment, frame engagement has not helped. 
Reconciliation, in its current usage, refers to unresolved issues among communities. These include all manner of grievances which include threat, vulnerability, inequality and other citizenship-anomalies
As in most cases, there are immediate issues to sort out and there are medium and long term objectives to achieve. There are immediate issues such as people in custody, those who are said to have disappeared and lands occupied by the military. Some of these are being addressed. 
There is demilitarization, for example, perhaps not at the speed that would please some, but its happening. On the other hand, demands such as wanting the military out of the North and East are silly. We cant have the military stationed in space or at sea. Furthermore, we are talking of a 30-year armed conflagration and it is prudent always to err on the side of caution. Demilitarization, yes, but complete removal of military presence therefore, a resounding no. 
That said, there iss no reason why properties occupied by the military should not be released to owners or, in the event that strategic consideration require continued occupation, alternative land be alienated to the particular citizens. Furthermore, as makes sense in times of peace, the focus should be on reconciliation of key issues and enhancing military intelligence operations, even as military presence is decreased. 
There is the issue of those in custody. It has been made complex by Tamil politicians including those who supported the LTTE calling for the release of all LTTE suspects even as they demand military personnel accused of wrongdoing during conflict be tried. On the other side of the divide, Sinhala nationalists are hell-bent on protecting all military personnel regardless of whether or not the particular infringement had anything to do with military activities. 

In this regard, the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) came up with a decent enough proposal, citing inter alia the unofficial amnesty that sorted out similar issues pertaining to the insurrection of the late eighties. They also noted that the affirmation of the principle of equal treatment where soldiers are to be charged would require the re-arrest of some 12,000 LTTE cadres who surrendered (many with weapons) and were released almost immediately following rehabilitation way back in 2009. 
The JHU called for a classification of crimes by the LTTE, military and para military groups currently in custody in terms of whether they were related to the conflict and whether they were in the pursuit of personal matters. Any individual, regardless of which military outfit he/she belonged to or post held, accused of pursuing objectives unrelated to the war or contravened conventions related to the execution of military action (e.g. rape, abduction, theft), in or out of uniform, should be tried, they said. All others, including the 60 plus LTTE cadres in custody should be released immediately. General Amnesty is what they have called for. Finally, they have said that with such a move all claims and demands pertaining to this issue should end. This makes sense. They have not, after all, called for the abolition of the Office of Missing Persons. Thats a separate issue, a medium-term one, one might add. 
I have already addressed the issue of citizenship anomalies when it comes to religious communities in a previous article in this series (see Notes for a Manifesto: State, Religion and Rationalization) and shall not go into it. Instead, lets move to the long-term.
Its thorny, naturally. Its about grievances and addressing of the same. The biggest problem here is that people have their preferred outcome and tailor grievance (with lots of frills) as well as the terms of engagement accordingly. There is the issue of language, where the legislation is in place but operationalization lagging due to lack of political will and resources, but theres certainly progress.
There are historical claims (e.g. The Exclusive Traditional Homelands of the Tamils for example, as claimed) based on which devolution solutions are proposed with scant regard for history (the archaeological and historical records are either ignored or corrupted, myth replacing truth more often than not), demography (close to 50% of Tamils live outside the North and East), geography (boundaries have no basis in history but were drawn arbitrarily by the British for their own purposes) and economic logic (uneven distribution of resources does not support the devolutionist case). 
The vandalizing-intent of the Tamil politicians (proceeding from where the LTTE stopped) as well as moves to create a Tamil-only territory (again proceeding from where the LTTE stopped) will not help obtain reconciliation
This is where reason must come to replace emotion. An historical audit need to be done. Grievances must be shorn of frills and whats obtained should be the basis of the reconciliation proposal. These issues have always been ignored in all consultative processes so far. Moreover, as was recommended by the LLRC (Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission), devolution should satisfy all communities. Key term, all communities.
Any solution that aggrieves one community (e.g. the Sinhalese) will not resolve, but make for renewed agitation. The vandalizing-intent of the Tamil politicians (proceeding from where the LTTE stopped) as well as moves to create a Tamil-only territory (again proceeding from where the LTTE stopped) will not help obtain reconciliation. Similarly, the nonsensical moves by state authorities to establish a Buddhist mark in certain areas of the Northern Province (putting up Buddha statues) offends and can only re-open wounds that are yet to fully heal. 
The key word is rationalization. Take it out and we dont obtain reconciliation but a grotesque creature by that name; misnamed, misbegotten and made for continued tensions or worseamong communities. 
This, like the previous articles in this series, is also addressed in particular to Nagananda Kodituwakku, Rohan Pallewatte, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, Patali Champika Ranawaka, Ranil Wickremesinghe, Maithripala Sirisena and any other individual entertaining hopes of becoming the next President of Sri Lanka.

Opening of Sri Lankas First International Mall Redefines Lifestyle in Colombo
	
After months of preparation, The Mall at Colombo City Centre opens to the public today amidst an ambience of colourful celebrations. Conveniently situated by the historic Beira Lake at the heart of the city, the ultramodern lifestyle destination is billed as Sri Lankas first international mall, and is set to transform not only the lifestyles of contemporary Sri Lankans, but also the urban fabric of Colombo as it develops into one of the greatest capitals on par with the best in the world.
This is a historic moment for Sri Lanka, said Anand Sundaram, CEO of Colombo City Centre. The denizens of Colombo have long deserved a world of cosmopolitan experiences befitting of the citys urban renaissance. And today we are proud to celebrate these experiences with them as they come to life in the countrys first international mall.
Mrs. Aban Pestonjee, Chairperson  Abans Group, the local partner behind Colombo City Centre also commented: Our initial vision behind the development of the Mall was to provide a place where Sri Lankan families can enjoy quality time together. I am glad to say that, with the mix of high-end local and international brands, food court, and 6-screen Cineplex, we will be achieving that ideal and offering Sri Lanka its first ever international Mall.
While Anand Nadathur, Group CEO, Next Story Group, the Singapore based joint venture partner added Urban spaces ought to be reimagined to match how consumers live, work, play and stay in the new digital age. Integrating these functions into a coherent & compelling series of well-designed spaces & experiences allows us to create & foster unique, thriving communities.

'Our Trumps' should also manage SL rupee: Susil
	
Just like US President Donald Trump is properly managing US economy, Our Trumps should also manage the Sri Lankan Rupee (LKR) to ensure the economic stability in the country, former minister and MP Susil Premajayantha said today.
MP Premajayantha told a Joint Opposition (JO) media conference that claims made by some government ministers were baseless that only the USs economy was stable at present whilst the economy of many other countries were facing issues.
Some ministers are saying that the LKR has depreciated due to President Trump. Why should President Trump be concerned about LKR It is justifiable from his part to concern about the US economy and US Dollar, he said.
Similar to President Trumps concern over US economy, Our Trumps should give a thought on the LKR, he added.
He said though some other countries were facing economic issues at this juncture, they had not become so weak as Sri Lanka since they were able to manage their economy through the exports.
The government has failed to maintain a strong export income which resulted in a huge downfall in the economy followed by the continuous depreciation of the LKR, he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

SL holiday scandal: British MP Paisley retains seat
	
British MP Ian Paisley, who was suspended from the House of Commons over the holiday scandal in Sri Lanka, has retained his seat as an MP after fewer than 10% of his constituents signed a petition that would have forced a by-election, the BBC reported on Thursday.
The petition needed 7,543 signatures - or 10% of Mr Paisley's constituents - to force a by-election and cause Mr Paisley to lose his seat. However, it was signed by 7,099 people.
Mr Paisley, who lobbied on the Sri Lankan government's behalf after the holidays, said: "In July I apologised for a mistake made almost six years ago. The electorate was asked to pass judgement - 90.6% have accepted my apology. I would like to thank my true friends, family, the electorate who have stood by me with unwavering support. Hallelujah,"
Sinn Fin North Antrim MLA Philip McGuigan said he was disappointed "that the requisite number of signatures was not secured to oust Ian Paisley from office" but he said "the issues at the heart of this scandal remain unchanged".
MP Paisley was suspended for 30 sitting days from September 4 after he failed to declare two holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government.
The Democratic Unionist Party also suspended Mr Paisley pending further investigation into his conduct.

Sunny Leone When the medium  is the message
	
The 1970s transiting into the 80s was the zaniest and most creative decade in Bollywood film making and music as India moved from sleepy socialism and sluggish Ambassador cars to frenetic capitalism and technological upheaval. It was a seismic shift in both technology and mindsets. Bollywood plots increasingly reflected this change. 
But just imagine this scenario: An American woman of Indian origin, one of the top 13 female porn stars in the world, decides to seek a career as a mainstream film actress in India. Instead of being stoned at the airport, she is welcomed at the highest circles and gets a dream break to act with Indias biggest screen idol, and gets rave reviews. Her American porn star husband joins her and they become celebrity media personalities, promoting cosmetics, consumer products (including condoms), and become the sort of high-profile couple many upwardly mobile young Indians would love to be. 
when MTV invited her to India to be a red carpet reporter for MTV Music Awards, she was at the height of her porn movie career
	She quit porn film making in 2010 with ambitions to act in Indian mainstream commercial films
A Bollywood melodrama This is the real life story of Sunny Leone, the Canadian American who climbed to the top of US porn star rankings in a very short time, and then called it quits to seek a film career in India, and succeeded well. But first things first. I became aware of the magnitude of Sunny Leones appeal in India only after I began looking for songs dedicated to that mythical Arabic beauty called Laila. 
Pornography is a movie phenomenon which exists parallel to the mainstream. Nowhere in the world is it respectable, but it has become acceptable in parts of the world
In real life, the only Laila of our times, who became internationally famous overnight, is that female member of the Palestinian Black September team which hijacked a TWA jetliner in 1969 (She now lives with her family in Amman, Jordan). In literature, the name Laila recurs in the Arabian Nights, and in the tragic narrative poem Laila and Majnun by the Persian poet Nezam Ganjavi (the Arabic Romeo and Juliet), and Laila has been celebrated in many Arabic songs. But the lure of her name isnt limited to the Middle East. Modern India celebrates this name in a number of film songs. Even the West isnt immune. Eric Claptons soulful 1970 pop ballad (spelt Layla) is proof of that. 
Bollywood made the name famous throughout India with the song Laila o Laila sung by Amit Kumar and Kanchan in the 1980 Hindi film Qurbani (Sacrifice), with music composed by the two brothers Kalyanji Anandji. 
The delightfully flawed Qurbani starred Feroz Khan as a safe-cracking robber and Zeenat Aman as a night club dancer and his lover. The song opens with a lovely acoustic instrument melody evoking Arabic maqum scales. 
There is, too, a more recent and shorter Bollywood version of this song, with electronic music and a zappier beat. The actors are Shah Rukh Khan and Sunny Leone, from Khans 2017 film Raees. The Qurbani version is balanced between the dancing figure of Zeenat Aman and the music. The second is all Sunny Leone. She is accompanied by other dancers, and the scenes are more crowded than in Qurbani, but she dominates the screen like a sinuous, kaleidoscopic spider. She is actually the web. 
If you want to enjoy the music, best go back to Qurbani. If you want titillation with a capital T, its Sunny Leone in Raees. Its riotous. In Qurbani, what you get is a controlled riot. The hyperactive band is balanced by Zeenat Amans graceful, measured dancing and the passive audience. The audio snuggles alongside the visual. In the second, the visual overpowers the audio part. It is also more visceral and raucous, the riot threatening to get out of control, with shots of frenzied dancers juxtaposed with equally frenzied, cheering, whistling, drunken men. In the end, though, what you remember is Sunny Leone. Its a sizzling performance, and the most electrifying song-dance sequence to come out of Bollywood in recent times. 
When Sunny Leone categorises adult films as just another form of entertainment, she is making a valid point as a lot of what comes out as music videos can be described as soft porn or worse
Appeared in 21 Indian movies
Sunny Leone has appeared in 21 Indian movies in just five years, but Bollywoods top ten megastars, both male and female (except Shah Rukh Khan) have shied away from appearing with her. No one has said this in so many words but the reason is clearly her porn star past. 
Theyve got her all wrong. She didnt come to India looking for respectability or stardom. She was already a star when she came to India. Its just that, with her restless energy, she found the adult film industry limiting, hence boring. In India, shes looking for more creative scope. 
But how to explain the phenomenon of Sunny Leone, and her astounding success in India, one of the most conservative countries in the world She may not count one day as one of Indias best or most versatile actresses. But her success lies in something more than acting ability. Her impact amounts to a cultural revolution. It seems to defy rational explanation, but we can try a few theories. She is the happy synthesis of several widely differing cultural currents. But how did it come about 
Sunny Leone (Karenjit Kaur Vohra) was born in Canada to Sikh parents in 1981, and started acting in adult movies in 2001 soon after becoming a Penthouse magazine playmate and ditching her nursing studies. Within a short time, she reached the top in that sphere. Almost from the very start, she seems to have been in control of her career, deciding what to make and with whom. At first, she said shed do only girl-girl movies (shes bisexual). Then she made a number of movies with other male actors, and finally settled on doing movies exclusively with her American husband. 
In 2005, when MTV invited her to India to be a red carpet reporter for MTV Music Awards, she was at the height of her porn movie career. That itself is a major feat, and it tells us more about modern India than it does about Sunny Leone. In 2003, she began her own adult movie productions (with her husband) to be marketed by Vivid, the US porn film production company which had initially hired her. She says this was her exit strategy from adult movies. 
By some quirk of good fortune, Sunny Leone didnt come across Donald Trump at that time. But, in case that happened, her aura may have forced him to change his mind about whatever he thinks about Asians. 
She quit porn film making in 2010 with ambitions to act in Indian mainstream commercial films, and got her first major Bollywood role in Pooja Bhatts Jism 2 in 2012. Then came the big break in 2017 acting alongside Shah Rukh Khan in Raees. Altogether, she has acted in 21 Indian films till now, including regional films. These arent among the best movies made in India, but shes said to be more popular than Katrina Kaif. Her popularity is out of all proportion to the length, breadth and depth of her career. Its like a fairy tale (of course, what you do in life will follow you with a vengeance; it has been her fate to be cast mainly in sultry roles and scenes). 
But its a remarkable achievement, and something unthinkable over here in Sri Lanka. No reputed film maker here would dare cast a porn film actress even in a cameo role. Assuming that we have our equivalent of Sunny Leone, flying in here with a North American accent and passport to join the film industry, one can imagine the clergy (Buddhist and other) howling in protest, together with a good section of our film community, and the president quickly signing a deportation order. (Then again, the former president, one imagines, would have offered her a seat in our parliament). 
No Indian actress with a background in pornography can make it to the mainstream. No one would even try it. But Sunny Leone could do this partly because she came out of nowhere
But this didnt happen in India. Why didnt Indias unofficial cultural police, the BJP-allied religious ultra right who are manic enough to attack modern paintings depicting nudes, attack her The answer lies in Indias currently dominant neo-liberal political and economic mindset which has tamed cultural puritanism and religious extremism into a willing partner of the moneys everything neoliberal economic game; in that context, they would see Sunny Leone as a success story, and success is what matters. Besides, the porn was made in the West, so that Indias Hindu extremist paragons of virtue can safely ignore it (while surfing the net on the sly to keep themselves informed). 
As one recalls, a parallel game existed here between Mahinda Rajapakse and our religious extremists. Unfortunately, we didnt have a Sunny Leone to profit from it and shine. 
Maintaining composure
But it should be noted that all Indians didnt welcome Sunny Leone. One woman filed a court action against her website, claiming that it promoted pornography, and the police opened a case. But the protests have been negligible and have no way deterred her career success and public image. One has the impression that many Indians, high and low, remain awed by Sunny Leone. Most interviewers have been tactful and sympathetic, though one tried to tear her apart. The way she maintained her composure during that TV ordeal won her many admirers. 
Her husband too, is part of this charm campaign. They are a handsome and winsome couple, and a regular part of TV quiz shows and talk shows. Her husband adores her and she says they are a monogamous couple. According to what she says, she has lived a charmed life from her Penthouse days till now, without any major missteps. 
But a North American documentary about her days in the adult film industry has a male former co-star, and an adult film industry commentator, talking about her moving with the wrong people, getting messed up and into drugs. But all that sounds inconclusive. It shows too, her husband being threatened by a porn film producer when told about her decision to do adult films from that point on exclusively with her husband, followed by a fight between the couple when he returns home and asks her to do a few scenes with other guys . Whether all this is fact or fiction, its hard to say. 
Whats clear is that, whatever missteps there may have been, and whatever mistakes shed made, Sunny Leone quickly overcame them, and raced along a very linear trajectory focusing on what she really wanted  to get out of adult films into Indias cultural life as a film actress and sort of a product ambassador. Even her assumed name Sunny (its her brothers nickname. Leone was tagged on by Penthouse) is designed to reflect the sunny side of her personality  all very positive vibes no matter where she is, with whom and what she does, apparently with no dark side, moods or bad days. 
Indian movie makers, north and south, eager to cast her in sexy roles (though there is little or no sex in her Indian movies, and the level of nudity, at least by world standards, is mild), are churning out a sultry Sunny. Jism 2 (produced by Mahesh Bhatt) is possibly the best movie she had done so far. But the way shes cast, with a body over mind attitude, undermines both the movie and her acting ability. 
She can look very disingenuous and sunny, or she can fit in nicely with the famous sultry (or femme fatale) actresses in movie history, from Greta Garbo, Sophia Loren and Brigitte Bardot down to Monica Belucci and Salma Hayek. But the sultry formula can harm an actress just as much as its polar opposite, the dutiful wife and housewife of all the film industries of the subcontinent (and that includes us). 
Thats why no other Indian actresses are mentioned in the above list. Thats because they, from Meena Kumari to Madhuri Dixit and Rani Mukherjee, have been stereotyped into that dutiful wife and housewife look. On screen, they resemble housewives with expensive wardrobes and studio make up. Like our Rukmani Devi, Jeevarani, Sandhya Kumari, Shriyani Amarasena or Malani Fonseka, they didnt get many chances to get sultry. 
The reason behind her smile
Thats the paradox. It does create a sense of unreality, made all the more unreal the way she behaves in front of a TV camera. When asked by a TV interviewer if whats shown in her adult movies (she prefers that word instead of pornography, making it sound more mainstream) is real or just acting, she quips its just that, acting and no more. Then she turns towards the camera with a hi and a big smile, and says sorry, but thats the truth, as if its a huge joke at the expense of all those men (and women, too; according to a survey, 30% of Indian women have watched pornography online) who are her fans from her previous life.
She has two fan bases in India, one visible, the other invisible. Presumably, no one will admit in public to being a fan of her porn movies. Presumably, too, the two fan bases overlap. No wonder shes smiling so much. 
She always behaves in front of a camera with great poise and self-composure. Whether its just acting, or real, what impresses is the way she can merge these two lives as if its the most natural thing in the world. Some of her porn videos have nearly 200 million hits, a figure which would make Lady Gaga green with envy. When Sunny Leone categorises adult films as just another form of entertainment, she is making a valid point as a lot of what comes out as music videos in hiphop, and even pop and rock, can be described as soft porn or worse. If one is classed as entertainment, why not the other 
She is a very sophisticated and precise speaker, and uses the word objectify a lot in her interviews. In her view, acting a role is as much a matter of objectification as, say, using a tea cup as a commercial product. Actually, its not that simple. While everything from break dancing to acting in porn movies or playing Anna Karenina can be lumped together as performance, we know what it takes to brings Tolstois character to life. Its a different level of performance, and cant be dismissed as another case of objectification. But this is a very materialist point of view and fits into neoliberal thinking. 
Pornography is a movie phenomenon which exists parallel to the mainstream. Nowhere in the world is it respectable, but it has become acceptable in parts of the world. In the West, attitudes range from acceptance to opposition and hostility, and pornography is no longer a hidden grey zone, with regular film festivals and stars going public. But it still causes discomfort in many minds. While it is tolerated on the internet, many individuals and organizations oppose it. Rear Admiral Richard Williams of the US Navy lost his job in 2016 when he was discovered watching porn on his official computer. The navy called it a moral crime. 
That said, attitudes towards pornography are more tolerant in the West than in many other parts of the world, as attitudes towards sex before marriage, the death penalty, or low-level drug trafficking and usage, abortion or same-sex marriages differ. It is in this relaxed climate that Sunny Leone made her career decisions and thrived. Its important to understand that though shes of Indian parentage and looks Indian, she is a more complex cultural hybrid. 
Pain caused to parents
Shes frank about the pain she caused her parents  first by becoming a Penthouse playmate, and then going into adult movies. But she seems to have remarkable powers of persuasion, as there was no permanent rift with the family. Both her parents are now deceased, and she says shes very close to her brother. 
As such, shes no renegade who has insultingly broken away from her roots. But its important to understand, by birth and her own peculiar temperament,, shes very un-Indian. Shes a potent and novel mix of East and West plus her own daring individualism. Shes totally a product of our times, someone whom Marshal McLuhan would have called a cool person (from a cool electronic culture) making an entry a hot culture. But there is no culture clash, post-McLuhan, because India too, is now in the process of becoming cool. 
That explains her startling lack of kammic overload, when everyone else in this part of the world is saddled with it, and her exasperation with those Indian interviewers who are worried about damage done to her image. But I read every word of that script, and agreed to every scene, before signing the contract, she tells them. Whys everyone so worried about me Indeed. Sunny Leone is someone who escapes all the conventional definitions. 
Interviewers have asked if Indian women didnt feel threatened by her presence. Thats a question that only Indian women can answer. On the other hand, many Indian women could feel challenged by her imperturbable presence. Itd be interesting to know what Arundhathi Roy, for example, thinks of Sunny Leone. Roys acclaimed first novel The God of Small Things was about breaking down social, economic and caste barriers. Leone too, has done that in her own way, and her impact on the Indian psyche could well be deeper. By not attempting to deny her past, and by saying publicly that she doesnt regret it ( And why should she It got her to where she is now) she has given a startling new makeover to the stereotype image of an Indian woman, high or low, seen by outsiders as submissive. Thats the significance of her cultural revolution. 
Thats a remarkable achievement, and one shouldnt forget that no porn star has ever made the grade as a big name mainstream film star in any part of the world. In the West, a few have gone mainstream, but mostly in horror and thriller genres, movies such as Spider Man, Ghostbusters, Predator II and Police Academy Part III being the exception. Sibel Kekilli got a role in the Game of Thrones. Even in the West, the transition is hard. How can an Indian woman do it 
To start with, she is Indian by looks and something else by psyche and temperament. She is seen in India by many as a super achiever with all the right attributes, and it isnt just her looks. Her ability to talk to the world in her own terms is impressive. Plus, she was already well off when she got to India, and you cant argue with success. The producer of Kalyug, which would have been her first Indian movie, reluctantly dropped her because she demanded one million dollars for the role. Some one with that kind of bargaining power will be treated with a lot of respect. It isnt just Indians who love success  but India is on the go now, and its no wonder that Sunny Leone with her looks, charm, highly articulate manner, international aura and devil-may-care attitude has become such a big hit in India. 
In short, she is a wonder woman of international dimensions whose scope seems to be bigger than that of any Indian film star, politician or business tycoon. That the films she has made so far are unremarkable doesnt matter in the least. If she wants to make a mark in the movies, she may have to work outside the commercial mainstream, taking huge risks. Her life is one of risk taking, but artistic risks and a willingness to lose money are another matter. 
But right now Indians are thrilled by the overall package  her image (both past and present, and that includes her husband), her gloss, her sophisticated, articulate manner, and her ability to sell anything that is even remotely associated with the name Sunny Leone. 
That commercial streak is something shes proud of. She says that even as a schoolgirl she was doing door-to-door-sales. One factor in her favour is that she came in at a time when India is thinking big. It wants to be a world player. Its India, and not the US, that has become Chinas biggest rival. Many Indians like to see their most successful people as both wealthy and sophisticated. She has both those qualities, as well as charisma. Adding to that allure, there is the paradox that she looks Indian, and sounds something else (that cool vs. hot factor). Her upbringing is Western, hence she is multicultural. As all invaders from Alexander the Great to the Mughals found out, India absorbs all cultures. Sunny Leone is an invader too, and one able to settle down and have the best of both worlds. Sunny Leone is not an Indian name but no one is bothered because Indias cultural tapestry is broad enough to accommodate almost anything, East to West. They seem to love it instead. 
She is neither Canadian or American or Indian, but rather a product of all these cultures. Its a very modern cultural hybrid, and points to the way the world will go in future. She may also be admired for her cultural independence, as she has not tried to be Indian to the core or look indigenous, trying to atone for her past. None of her TV interviews show her in a sari. She is essentially what she has always been, someone who lives life at the surface but to the maximum. While those in beauty business (In India and elsewhere) are eager to show their intellectual side, Sunny Leone isnt bothered about that at all. Her take-me-for-what I am attitude must be very refreshing for all those who constantly worry about the public eye and what others including the media think of them. No wonder many Indians seem to think that Sunny Leone is a very good thing to happen to India, sort of a product ambassador, the product being herself. 
A generation ago, before Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh liberalized Indias socialist-capitalist hodgepodge economy, that would not have been the case. Her very open take it or leave it attitude about herself would have seemed brash even for a man, let alone a woman. But India has changed, and she is a product of the new age -- hard to pin down culturally, something many would find fascinating and mysterious. And mystery is what makes a woman all the more attractive. 
Coming out of nowhere
No Indian actress with a background in pornography can make it to the mainstream. No one would even try it. But Sunny Leone could do this partly because she came out of nowhere (or a cooler culture), and partly because she is not ashamed of her past, which is a peculiarly individual mindset, and not something hot or cool. She doesnt carry her eastern kamma on her shoulders; nor is she weighed down by any sense of Western original sin. In short, shes a very secular entity in what is still a very religious country, and this bold and independent approach has earned her a lot of admiration. 
Shes an achiever of a special kind, and thats why she has made it to the BBCs 100 Women list, which lists women who have distinguished themselves in various spheres from all over the world. She sits there as an actress alongside women bullfighters, political activists, students, political activists, astronomers, architects, writers, librarians, cricketers, teachers and entrepreneurs. Arundhati Roy isnt in that list, but Sunny Leone is. 
Whatever the reasons for what one may call the Sunny Leone phenomenon, the impact of her presence in Bollywood and India will be felt in many sectors of Indian life in future. Indian actresses may envy Sunny Leone because the socio-cultural parameters they must work within are too narrow for them to try and be daringly different, while she crosses over with contemptuous ease. 
Bollywood actress Pooja Bhatt (director of Sunny Leones first Bollywood movie) once told journalist Tina Mukharandi how her father (actor and producer Mahesh Bhatt) warned her about the real world behind the celluloid (nowadays digital) world. 
He told me, girl, if you want to be an actress, be ready to sacrifice whats sacred to you, your soul. It took me a while to understand what he meant. Well, Im a woman. I lost my virginity long ago. 
Sunny Leone doesnt need to talk about sacrifices because she is un-Indian in those essential areas. What sacrifices She looks as if shes enjoyed it all to the hilt. She said in one interview that she was never abused, raped or hurt during her adult movie career, which makes the adult movie industry sound safer than Hollywood or Bollywood in the wake of the Me Too movement. But that may be her own personal perspective, not the general view. 
This is precisely what makes her seem so special to many people. She can absorb India and India can absorb her. While her argument that everything boils down to entertainment sounds like an oversimplication, her ability to make her career moves look painless, even a joyride, is a considerable artistic achievement in itself. Her successful entry into and presence in India is as good an indicator of recent, profound changes in Indian society as is the recent decision by Indias Supreme Court to decriminalise homosexuality. 
In the final analysis, as she continues her exploration of Indian society, promoting everything from animal rights, cosmetics, condoms and B movies with her charming husband and sunny smile, she brings a cataclysm of change in her wake. She has neutralized the rabid religious extremists who want to keep women in the dark ages simply by being there. To a new generation of empowered Indians who are increasingly sure of their place in the world but unsure of their sexuality within the traditional, conservative societal mould, she is sending a seemingly unaggressive but highly effective message with her completely at ease so what attitude. 
And that message is:  Be yourself, and youll be OK in the end. 
In other words, Sunny Leone is both the medium and the message.

Twist in CID probe as Namal changes tune
	
The arrested Police informant Namal Kumara has contradicted the statement he made on the alleged threats on the lives of President Maithripala Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa and as such, the CID inquiry on the issue had taken a different turn, Cabinet Spokesman Dr Rajitha Senaratne said yesterday.
The media last week gave wide publicity to a press conference held by Namal Kumara in which he came up with a shocking exposure that there was an attempt on the lives of President Sirisena and Gotabaya Rajapaksa instigated by Director, Terrorist Investigation Division, (TID) Deputy Inspector General Nalaka Silva.
Responding to the media at yesterdays weekly Cabinet news briefing, Minister Senaratne said there were so many contradictions and fabrications in the statement made by Namal Kumara and nevertheless the CID would continue to investigate the allegations and find the truth.
The allegations made by this man are extremely sensitive and alarming and the CID will go to the bottom of the statement he made before the media, he said.
If his allegations were fabrications, he would be in deep trouble. If the allegations of conspiracy to harm President Sirisena and Gota were true, then DIG Nalaka Silva will also be dealt with strict legal actions against him. However, we will have to wait until the CID inquiry is over, Minister Senaratne said.
Minister Senaratne added that the Cabinet did not discuss the issue as the CID was in the process of investigation on the threat and added the inquiries revealed that he had made this allegation as a tit-for-tat because the Police had allegedly failed to pay him for some information provided to the Police by him. Whether the allegations were truthful or not, there must be a thorough investigation on them because the threats to lives were of the President and former Defence Secretary, he said.
He has been paid Rs. 500,000 by the TID but he is not satisfied and demanded more. We have information that it was this man who has provided information to the Police on the communal clashes that took place at Digana in Kandy, last March, Minister Senaratne said.
The CID has recorded two statements from him so far, he said.
Responding to a journalist as to why DIG Silva had not been arrested up to now, Minister Senaratne said a Senior Police Officer could not be arrested without hard evidence but if there were a prima-facie case against him, he would be definitely arrested and charges would be filed against him. Minister Senaratne said the Police would provide security to Namal if his life was actually under threat as claimed by him.
Answering a query raised by another journalist on the controversy involving Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne, Minister Senaratne said President Sirisena was not happy on the attempt to arrest the CDS. The CID has every right to arrest Admiral Wijegunaratne if the CID had clear evidence against him. But President has to be informed in advance of any action against CDS because he is the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Defence Minister and then the Executive President, Minister Senaratne said.
He added that the President had no problem with the arrest of any armed forces or Police personnel with provable evidence. Sandun A Jayasekera)

US MCC to improve Colombo road network and bus system
	
The proposed compact Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), would improve road networks and the bus system in the Colombo Metropolitan Region, and improve road connectivity between the central region and ports and markets in the Western Province.
The compact would upgrade more than 300 kilometers of urban and interprovincial roads. In addition, the compact would improve land administration, and strengthen land rights and tenure security.
A delegation from the U.S. Governments Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), led by Chief Operating Officer Jonathan Nash, visited Sri Lanka this week to continue progress on the proposed MCC compact  a large-scale five-year grant program. MCC is developing the compact in partnership with the Government of Sri Lanka to promote inclusive economic growth that will benefit Sri Lankans.
During the visit, COO Nash met with senior government officials, including Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Minister of Finance Mangala Samaraweera, State Minister of Finance Eran Wickramaratne, and Foreign Secretary Prasad Kariyawasam.
The proposed MCC Sri Lanka Compact is in the final stage of development. The compact is expected to be negotiated with the Government of Sri Lanka in the coming weeks. MCC will fund the compact entirely through grants which do not need to be repaid rather than loans.
The proposed MCC compact reflects our commitment to development projects that make economic sense and drive growth in a way that increases local jobs, said Charg daffaires Robert Hilton. With this compact, we have an opportunity to promote transparent decisions about Sri Lankas long-term interests in terms of costs, benefits, and sustainable development.
We are pleased that progress continues on the proposed MCC compact, said MCC COO Nash. Developed in partnership with the Government of Sri Lanka, the proposed MCC Sri Lanka Compact is designed to spur economic growth and investment by the private sector to reduce poverty and increase economic opportunities for the people of Sri Lanka,
Based on an analysis of Sri Lankas economy and the constraints that are holding back private investment and growth, MCC expects to invest in projects proposed by the Government of Sri Lanka in the transport and land sectors.
The proposed compact would improve road networks and the bus system in the Colombo Metropolitan Region, and improve road connectivity between the central region and ports and markets in the Western Province. The compact would upgrade more than 300 kilometers of urban and interprovincial roads. In addition, the compact would improve land administration, and strengthen land rights and tenure security.
MCC is an innovative foreign assistance agency of the United States Government established in 2004 that has signed compacts with 29 countries around the world. In December 2016, MCCs Board of Directors selected Sri Lanka to develop a compact.

VOICE OF PEOPLE
	
I am happy to see the growing movement of Sri Lankans who are committed to mindful living. This includes social entrepreneurs working to address social and environmental problems, responsible business leaders who choose to prioritize people and planet over short term profits, and the artists and storytellers who inspire us and help us envision a better world. It also includes the broader community of people making changes in their day to day lives: refusing plastic straws, plastic bottles and plastic bags, planting trees and home gardens, reducing waste and recycling, volunteering and contributing to causes they care about, asking where products came from, and supporting businesses that share their values. I am happy and proud that Sri Lanka is in the top 10 in the Global Giving Index.Achala SamaradiwakaraFounder  Good Market
Its great that the has come forward with this new unique concept. At a time when people go behind various possessions not knowing from where to find true happiness, I think its timely for such details to be shared specially to discover from where one could discover inner happiness and peace.Joel OutschoornNews Anchor and TV/Radio presenter

## Title: When Ming China invaded Kotte...

When Ming China invaded Kotte...
	
In AD 1405,Emperor Yung-lo, the third in the Ming Dynasty, organised and sanctioned a series of maritime voyages overseen by Admiral Zheng He. Referred to (casually and informally) today as the Ming treasure voyages, these marked the first real time that Imperial China set out to discover the world outside. 
There were seven voyages in total. It is said that if they had continued, and if the Emperor had not constrained them on account of internal conflicts, China would have outdone Columbus in the discovery of the New World. Doubtful though the intentions of these treks are - some argue that they were peaceful expeditions, others point at them as evidence of the Empires colonialist ambitions - theres no doubting the fact that they were a milestone for China. 
First voyage (1405-1407) took them to Java, Malacca, Calicut, andSri Lanka
	Zheng Hes objective, de Silva observes, was to take back the Dalada
	Parakramabahu VI actively strove to unify the fragmented country
The first voyage (1405-1407) took them to Java, Malacca, Calicut, and Sri Lanka, among other places. Originally, the voyagers had not planned on entering the Bay of Bengal, but two or three days after they left the Kingdom of Lambri (in Sumatra), one ship sailed off to Andaman and Nicobar. A week later, the fleet spotted the mountains of Sri Lanka, and two days later, they embarked on the islands western coast. But this country did not take too kindly to the visitors, since soon after embarking, the fleet had to retreat on account of the hostility of the king,Vijayabahu VI.
Just what the motives of the fleet were in landing at Sri Lanka, we dont know. K. M. de Silva contends that the Chinese harboured imperialist ambitions, and that they desired a key symbol of the islands Buddhist culture: the Sacred Tooth Relic. Zheng Hes objective, de Silva observes, was to take back the Dalada. Not that Chinese interest in the Dalada was new, since in 1284Kublai Khan himself had dispatched a mission to the island for the same purpose; it had returned to China with its main aim unaccomplished but, seemingly and fortunately for Sri Lanka, without a sense of grievance. This thesis flatly contradicts other accounts which depict the voyage to Sri Lanka as an accident. In any case, theres no doubt that Zheng He, rebuffed and forced to retreat, wanted to return, to show the islanders that they were a fleet to reckon with. 
Here it is pertinent to dwell on the paradigm shift that had transpired in China by the time of the seven maritime voyages. The Ming Dynasty had defeated the Mongols, of the Yuan Dynasty, but it was the Mongols who had opened up the sea and the desert, the two outlets through which China would soon claim prosperity. This set a precedent for the country, since as the eminent historian Fernand Braudel observed, China was, though rich and fertile, a semi-immobile economy which refused to look beyond its frontiers or to open them up to outside civilisation. 
Neither feudal nor capitalist in the Western sense of those terms, Chinese society was more secular than continental Europe, so much so that the three great religions (or theologies) which passed through it - Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism - became as favoured as Islam and Catholicism, which too got rooted in Chinese soil. Until the Yuan Dynasty, however, China kept on looking inward. And yet, while its economic record was modest compared to that of the West (which grew at a tortoises pace of 0.12% per year, according to Professor Ha Joon-Chang, at a time when the East grew at a snails pace of 0.04%) because of this, it had successfully tapped into its reserves of wheat, maize, rice, and manpower, thereby doing away with the need to look out. 
Though it was slow in catching up with the West (Braudel writes on how, even in the 18th century, sugar cane was cut, not by machines, but by craftsmen), China did not abandon the transition from pre-industrial to industrial society. For this, however, a thriving market needed to be in place. It was at the time of the Yuan Dynasty that such a market first emerged, with traders willing to spend money on the pride and vanity of public ostentation. Even in the 13th century, Kamalika Pieris observes, China had become a powerful arrival in the trade sector. 
Once the Yuan Dynasty (which had lasted for almost a century) was defeated in 1368, the Ming Dynasty shut down the sea and desert the Mongols had opened earlier, in keeping with tradition. But never again would it look inward; the new Empire sought instead to add to the gains made by the Mongols through naval conquests. 
It was this attitude, which could be taken as paternalistic or imperialist depending on how you see it, that gave the impetus to all seven of Zheng Hes voyages. Whether or not the capture of the Tooth Relic figured in his scheme of things is impossible to ascertain, regardless of de Silvas contention, but it is true that all seven voyages were premised on two objectives: discovery of the outside world, and conquest of treasures and valuables, albeit through peaceful and diplomatic means. 
Five years would pass before He and his fleet returned. Even here the records are notoriously difficult to verify. Most scholars argue that Zheng He returned to the island in 1411, while on his way back to China. Edward Dreyer, on the other hand, contends that he returned on the OUTWARD journey, in 1410. This difference of one year is significant, for if Dreyer is correct and Hes fleet did return to Sri Lanka during the outward journey, it indicates that one of its primary motives on this voyage was to display its power to the adamant Vijayabahu VI. If that is so, it confirms the thesis, sustained by some, that Sri Lanka, on the whole a peaceful civilization, was interfering in the foreign relations of the Ming Dynasty in the subcontinent to such an extent that Imperial China needed to express its discontent in military terms.

Historians are fortunately not divided on what Zheng He did once he landed in the island. Vijayabahu VI became the first monarch after Mihindu V to be defeated and held captive by an Eastern power. (It is a sign of how peaceful Zheng Hes army were that while holding the King captive, they did not telescope the invasion of Kotte into an invasion of the country; that was left for the Europeans, whose exploits were more remorseless.) But while the invasion has been conclusively sketched out, theres one aspect to it that has not been so conclusively determined: the fate of the Tooth Relic. Certain sources indicate that Zheng He took it to China, only to return it home with the captured King, while other sources indicate it was never taken, since subsequent reports on the possession of the Relic make it evident that it continued to be in Kotte.
It is said that Vijayabahu VI felt so humiliated, not only at being captured by the Chinese, but also at being allowed to return to Sri Lanka so liberally, that he gave up any hope of reclaiming his throne. The only monarch who had suffered his fate before had been Mihindu V, but that had been the result of defeat at the hands of a powerful outside army. In Vijayabahus case, the outside army had not only entered his domain, they had also left it with him. Worse, they had even groomed a (Chinese) successor to the throne, with whom they were to return to the island three years later, in AD 1414, as a show of strength, solidarity, and friendship, a telling demonstration of Chinese strength and Sinhalese weakness. 
The invasion obviously shook the fabric of Sinhala society. The Chinese encounter would explain, in part at least, why the later Parakramabahu VI actively strove to unify the fragmented country, becoming the first (and last) Sinhalese monarch since Parakramabahu I and Nissanka Malla to bring the whole country under one rule. 
In any case, no Eastern power would conquer the island again, save for one moment in the Second World War when the Japanese attacked Colombo and the Trincomalee Harbour. It is said that Winston Churchill considered this the most dangerous moment in the War. That aptly sums up Sri Lankas place in the world: in 1942 as in 1410 (or 1411), the threat of outside invasion by a power as dominant as China or Japan (and not India, which had been assimilated to Sinhalese society during the Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa periods), was just too dangerous to shrug off. It could afford to be indifferent to such threats only at the cost of a later invasion. At any rate, that was the lesson that Zheng He, predating the more aggressive Europeans, had taught us.

World Bank warns SL to take actions over climate change
	
Rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns pose a threat to Sri Lanka and could reduce GDP and living standards, a new World Bank report says.
The report South Asias Hotspots: The Impact of Temperature and Precipitation Changes on Living Standards flags that almost half of South Asias population now lives in vulnerable areas called hotspots that could see their living standards decline as a result of falling crop yields, lower labor productivity, or related health impacts. Some of these hotspots, the report notes, are already vulnerable as they are less developed, suffer from poor connectivity, and are water stressed.
According to the report, in Sri Lanka, areas in northern and north-western provinces are the most likely to experience increases in average temperature and more variable precipitation by 2050. The analysis concludes that Sri Lankas average annual temperatures could rise by 1.0C to 1.5C by 2050 even if carbon emission reduction measures are taken as recommended by the Paris Agreement of 2015. If no measures are taken average temperatures in Sri Lanka could increase by up to 2.0C.
Weather changes will result in lower per capita consumption levels that could further increase poverty and inequality across South Asia, said Muthukumara Mani, a lead economist in the World Bank South Asia Region and author of the report.
Identifying climate hotspots will help policymakers prioritize resources and actions in specific locations and communities where they are the most needed, he added.
The report provides options to prioritize investments and strategies to build local resilience to climate change. The analysis suggests that creating opportunities in less climate-sensitive sectors through enhancing education opportunities, improving market access, and generating non-agricultural jobs could reduce the overall severity of climate-related impact on the living standards of the vulnerable. If these interventions were implemented together, they would likely yield greater benefits than if implemented individually.
The World Bank is working closely with the Government of Sri Lanka to support climate resilience and adaptation to climate change. Under the Climate Resilience Improvement Project, which is supporting investments to improve flood protection and resilience to landslides. The proposed Climate Smart Irrigated Agriculture Project is scheduled for approval this year and will support improved water management for agriculture including the rehabilitation of irrigation systems in identified hotspot areas of the country.
Development is the best adaptation strategy, since it is associated with improved infrastructure, market-oriented reforms, enhanced human capabilities, and stronger institutional capacity to respond to the increasing threat of climate change and natural disasters, added Mani.
