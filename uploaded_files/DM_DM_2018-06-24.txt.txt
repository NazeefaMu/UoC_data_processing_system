Army denies withdrawing its formations in North and East
	
Sri Lanka army said some political elements are attempting to put the national security at risk by misleading the public on the grounds that the Army is in the process of withdrawing its formations in the North and East and downsizing its strength.
A canard, born out of some utterances, reportedly made by disgruntled political elements has been desperately attempting to mislead the public. We have not taken any such decision, nor has it contemplated implementing a move of that nature at all as alleged by those elements who try to showcase that they are more patriotic than members of the armed forces in the country., the Army said.
The Army while continuing amalgamation process without closing down any camp in the North and East maintains combat readiness and efficiency in combat at all times at strategic and operational level and is always committed to enhance its efficiency at all levels.
The army said in a statement that many in the civil society have no understanding on some of the military parlance, like amalgamation/combat efficiency. Similarly, the Army currently engaged in its annual recruitment drive plans to recruit 213 Officers and 8631 other rankers to the Regular Force and 97 officers and 4252 other rankers to the Sri Lanka Army Volunteer Force for the year 2018. 
The Army which has brought peace to this country after so many years would be the happiest in peacetime and is committed all the time to safeguard the national security interests of the country on a priority basis than anyone else. It is therefore requested that those supper patriots to desist from bringing this unique organization to public ridicule by spreading blatant lies and misleading false information, the Army said.

Calling for military rule is contrary to Buddhism - PM
	
If someone called for a Hitler type military rule in this country in my presence I would have condemned it right there as it is against Buddhism, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said over the weekend.
The Prime Minister said this at a ceremony held to mark the 125th anniversary of Maha Manthinda Priviena in Matara on Saturday.
He was referring to a recent statement made by Anunayake of Asgiriya Chapter Venerable Wendaruwe Upali Thera.
If someone called for a dictatorship in my presence I would have opposed it right there. This is because it is a statement against the teachings of Buddha. Media would have criticized me heavily if I made such a statement. They would have got others to issue statements about it. The story about this statement was published only in one newspaper but electronic media gave it wide publicity. Newspapers have missed the story. I did not see even an editorial about it. What would happen to media if such a military rule comes to power the Prime Minister said.
Sri Lanka is a civilized country; we have earned the respect of the world because of our Buddhist heritage. We have been able to maintain democracy in this country because of Buddhism, the Prime Minister added.
Germans were interested in Buddhism in the 19th Century and there were several organizations which promote Buddhism in Germany. However, they were closed down by Hitler when he came to power. Those who were following Buddhism and other religions in Germany during that time were jailed. I cannot understand how dictatorship and Buddhism could coexist. Everyone should have the freedom of expression but no one has the right to call for dictatorship, he also said.
The Prime Minister said what Buddha thought was to consult, confer and disperse peacefully and to respect ideologies expressed by all people. Buddha never thought anyone to become dictators and never endorsed killing people and forceful disappearances. Therefore he thought us to respect democracy, he said
Government is running the country according to the teachings in Buddhism and if Buddhism faces any danger, government wont hesitate to take action against such a move, he stressed.
Mr. Wickremesinghe also revealed that the government is looking towards amending Privena Education Bill. He said advice of most Venerable Maha Nayaka Theras will be sought for this purpose. Mr. Wickremesinghe said monks should be trained in languages so that they can go all over the world and preach Buddhism.
Maha Nayaka of Kalyana Samagri Dharma Maha Sanga Sabha Venerable Ittepane Dhammalankara Thera who also participated in the event, endorsed the governments decision to amend the Priven Education Bill. Prime minister sought my advise on amending the Privena Education Bill and I think it is essential, the Thera said. (Yohan Perera and Krishan Jeewaka Jayaruk)

Hajj agents heap charges on Hajj Committee
	
The Hajj Agencies Union of Sri Lanka today urged President Maithripala Sirisena to appoint a Commission to probe the alleged corruptions in the Hajj pilgrimage committee at the Department of Muslim Religious And Cultural Affairs, which comes under the purview of Ministry of Muslim Religious Affairs.
Addressing a press conference, All Ceylon Hajj Organisation Vice President Dr MSM Mohammad said despite the directives made by the Supreme Court on Hajj criteria and guidelines for Hajj pilgrimage, Minister A.H.M Haleem and his brother A.H.M. Fahim-who were also the Private Secretary to the Minister-were continuously violating it.
He said that the agencies had filed lawsuits on several occasions informing the arbitrary action of the authorities without much success.
Dr Mohamed said although a quota for 3,000 pilgrims received by Saudi Arabia annually, only 2,500 from the list was selected, while some 200 slots were reserved for staff and the remaining vacancies were distributed and sold among authoritys supporters.
He said that the around 20,000 pilgrims are currently in the Hajj Committees waiting list, however, the Hajj Committee overlook several individuals in the list and gave the opportunity to outsiders by obtaining bribes.
He further said that an additional quota for 600 was received last year and the Department of Muslim Religious And Cultural Affairs charged Rs 1,44,000 per head only to provide accommodation in Saudi Arabia.
Dr Mohamed charged the department had received a sum over of Rs 86 million from those 600 pilgrims, however, had not issued a receipt for the collected money.
He also said that it was learned that those pilgrims had to undergo severe inconveniences during their visit and the entire crew had stayed in two buildings which even without electricity.
He requested the information officer of the department to expose the balance sheet of the Hajj tour under the Right to Information Act.
Meanwhile, Dr Mohamed said although it was not permitted to collect a registration fee, the department collected a registration fee of Rs 2,000 while another Rs 4,000 was charged as a service charge.
The approved service charge is Rs 2,000, he said.
According to the Supreme Court verdict, Dr Mohamed said at least a four-month period should be given to Hajj pilgrims to choose their agency, however, the Hajj Committee gave only two weeks.
The Daily Mirrors attempts to contact the Subject Minister over the allegations, however, was not successful. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

University Education in imminent jeopardy- CaFFE
	
There would be a negative impact on the University Education in the long-run because of the Rs. 1 billion worth of funds of the University Grants Commission (UGC) that had been invested in the controversial bond transaction, Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) said.
Executive Director of CaFFE and Centre for Human Rights and Research (CHR) Keerthi Tennakoon told the Daily Mirror that Rs.146 million loss had been incurred by the UGC on account of the said transaction.
It has been estimated that 42 per cent of the 2017 Expenditure Estimates of the UGC had been invested in Central Bank Bonds.
Even though, the Minister of High Education had said that the loss caused to the UGC due to the bond transaction was Rs.141mn, the actual loss is Rs. 146mn and even this might exceed, Tennakoon said.
It was questionable as to who gave the endorsement to go for such massive investments that have caused colossal loss to the University education. These mega transactions have made the future higher education uncertain, Tennakoon added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
