Drought in Kilinochchi brings misery to thousands
	
A population of about 82,000 people representing 24,100 families in the Kilinochchi District have been affected by the drought prevailing in the area.
A senior official of the District Disaster Management Centre said the people of Kilinochchi, Kandawalai. Pachilipalai, Karachchi and Poonaryn divisions were the worst affected. He said all garden wells had run dry creating hardships for the people for want of drinking water.
Meanwhile farmers pointed out that all tanks and canals in Kilinochchi, Dharmapuram, Puliyanpokkanai and Kallaru areas had run dry and the cattle and other animals were dying as a result. They said the wild elephant roaming into the villages in search of water were destroying paddyfields and home garden crops. The farmers said their cultivations would be ruined and crop failure would result in a severe shortage of paddy if the drought continued.
Official said steps were being taken to provide a skeleton supply of drinking water to the affected areas. (Romesh Madushanka)

## Title: Imperative for nuclear disarmament Is Putin the puppet-master?

Imperative for nuclear disarmament Is Putin the puppet-master?
	
?
Everything gets said, nothing gets done. When President Donald Trump met President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki last month we were promised all sorts of goodies- progress in reconciliation in Ukraine and Syria, and not least nuclear disarmament. If there is progress behind the scenes it?s not noticeable to the?naked eye.??
People talk about Trump being in Putin?s pocket yet when, soon after Trump became president, Putin suggested major cuts in nuclear weapons Trump turned him down. This would have been a fantastic way to start his presidency. He could have upped Barack Obama?s achievement of getting the arsenal down to 1550 warheads each. In nearly everything else he wants to destroy Obama?s legacy or minimize it. This would have been a way to do it.??
?
Judge a person by what he does, not by what he says. The Trump? Administration in its new nuclear review suggests the deployment of? smaller nuclear bombs that will make them more usable, for example by? blocking an advance of troops
?
This doesn?t sound to me like Putin, the supposed puppet master, was pulling the strings on his marionette, Trump.??
Let that be, maybe we?ll find out the truth soon enough. Meanwhile the massive stockpile remains, despite enormous cuts (80%) since Cold War days. The US is committed to a 1.7 trillion dollars? improvement over 30 years in its nuclear arsenal, the price Obama had to pay to get the new treaty with Russia approved in the Senate. (It?s called START.)? ?
In Helsinki, Putin suggested that they extend the life of START, due to expire in 2012, since it only requires both presidents to agree. Parliamentary approval is not necessary. But again Trump seems to be procrastinating.??
Meanwhile, many rockets still remain on hair-trigger alert. Many military men worry that under pressure Trump might authorise their use and that a military used to obeying orders would initiate a launch. ?A demented commander-in-chief could start a conflagration that no one could forestall, veto or stop?, says the Arms Control Association. Added to that are false warnings caused by birds, computer malfunctions etc. There?s also the danger of rogue submarine commanders who can fire their nuclear missiles without a confirming radio signal since they have to surface to receive one. In wartime they might not be able to safely surface.??
Once a Russian attack is launched (or a US one on Russia), the presidents have only six minutes to make a decision if retaliation is to be implemented. Zibigniew Brzezinski, the former National Security Advisor, has talked about how he was awakened in the night and informed by the military that an attack might be on its way. He waited three minutes before he had to phone President Jimmy Carter who was also asleep. Fortunately, at that moment a second call came in, saying it had been a false alarm.??
Last week in an amazing statement a group of former intelligence chiefs more or less said, according to an op-ed article in the New York Times, that the military should think twice before following Trump?s orders in a crisis.??
The arms race continues. Both sides are developing hypersonic missiles, new missile defence capabilities, offensive cyber weapons and anti-satellite and counter-space weapons. Any of these could disturb the rough equilibrium of the Cold War days when it was clearly obvious that one side couldn?t have an advantage over the other. Putin is still swallowing the bitter pill of President George W Bush?s decision to pull out of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, allowing it to press ahead with a land-based missile system that Russia views as a direct, deliberate threat.??
Shuffled into a back corner is the joint statement of presidents Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev that ?a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.???
Judge a person by what he does, not by what he says. The Trump Administration in its new nuclear review suggests the deployment of smaller nuclear bombs that will make them more usable, for example by blocking an advance of troops. It is also leaning towards widening the conditions under which nuclear weapons may be used first in response to a non-nuclear act of aggression. This will revoke Obama-era assurances given to non-nuclear countries that the US would never attack them with nuclear weapons. This would sabotage the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty that has done much to keep limited the number of countries that want to develop?nuclear weapons.??
For the last seven decades, since the end of World War 2, the world is probably living in its most benign years of peace. Yes, there are a number of civil wars but interstate wars have fallen precipitously. As a result territorial conquest has nearly disappeared. Before 1928 the average state could expect to be conquered about once every lifetime. Now the average country will be subject to conquest roughly once or twice in a millennium. So write Oona Hathaway and Scott Shapiro in their book, ?The Internationalists?.??
Strategists say nuclear weapons help keep this peace. Maybe they do- until something goes wrong.?
We can?t afford to live with a gamble like that, especially so when Trump has his finger on the button.? The writer was a member of the International Commission on Common Security, chaired by Prime Minister Olaf Palme of Sweden. The subject was nuclear weapons.?
The report was published on the front page of The New York Times. I wrote for the Times the same day an?op-ed piece.)??

New proposal to increase Auditor General?s salary: Kiriella
	
A new motion will be submitted to Parliament to increase the Auditor General?s salary and allowances, House Leader Lakshman Kiriella said yesterday.
He told Parliament the new proposal would be for a salary much higher that what was proposed in the earlier proposal. ?We withdrew the earlier motion to give a greater salary increase to the Auditor General. The government never meant to harass him,? Mr. Kiriella said.
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) on Thursday charged that the government was trying to harass Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe by withdrawing the proposal presented to Parliament to increase his salary and allowances.
JVP Leader and Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake made this allegation when Mr. Kiriella announced the government?s decision to withdraw the proposal on Thursday morning.
?Auditor General is carrying on a campaign to stop corruption and had already disclosed certain facts. We feel that the government is subjecting Auditor General to political victimization,? Mr. Dissanayake said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Planting a tree is like building a palace
	
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday launched the Cascaded Tank-Village system in the Dry Zone and the second stage of the Wayamba River irrigation scheme near the Kubukulawa Tank at Polpithigama in the Kurunegala district. The Cascaded Tank-Village system in the Dry Zone has been described by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) as a globally important agricultural heritage system.? ?
Speaking at the launching ceremony President Sirisena emphasized the vital need for responsible citizens to cooperate with the government and other institutions in the battle against global warming or climate change. He said that at one time Sri Lanka was number 59 in the list of countries worst affected by global warming or climate change. Now we had plunged to number 4 mainly because of the operations of racketeers or organized gangs involved in deforestation, illegal sand mining and similar frauds.? The President quoted one of Sri Lanka?s famous kings as saying that planting a tree was more important than building a palace.? ?
Here is some enlightened? information from the Green Med info team. It says there are 3 stages people go through when they wake up to the power of food to transform their lives.? ?
The first stage of the health revolution recognizes food as the most powerful way to improve your health. Here, people start eating healthier, buying organic and maybe even exploring farmers markets.? ?
Green Med says the second stage is understanding the power of super foods. In this stage, people start using powerful plants like wheat grass, maca, chia, moringa and matcha. That is where most people stop but the next stage is where things really get interesting.? ?
This third stage is the source of Green Medicine. We bring in powerful herbs that supercharge our health and target our most persistent issues -- stress, mental focus, hormone imbalances, energy levels and even incurable chronic disease. This is the next revolution in plant-based healing and natural health.? ?
Ancient medicine for modern illness is a hard-hitting, transformative documentary series (Greenmedinfo.com) exploring the most powerful herbal medicines known to us. But it is not only ?medicine? for sick people to become healthy. It is also medicine that helps healthy people become even stronger and more vital.? ?
During the past four decades in Sri Lanka we have been using excessive amounts of imported agro-chemical fertilisers, weedicides and pesticides. As a result our mother earth has been polluted or poisoned to a great extent, so has our underground water. In addition many traders are known to be using preservatives on grains, vegetables and fruits. Some of these preservatives are known to be toxic, therefore Sri Lanka is in a crisis that with every meal we are eating a little poison and also giving it to our children.? ?
Many experts believe that this is one of the main reasons why more people are falling sick more often. Medical doctors often cannot diagnose the cause of the ailment and experiment with patients. This is happening amid another crisis where medicine which was once a sacred vocation like the priesthood later became a profession and is now a profit-making business especially in the private health sector. That is why multi billion rupee investors are putting their money into building private hospitals which have become one of the biggest profit making businesses.? ?
In 1970 the then finance minister Dr. N.M. Perera in his budget said he saw ?the dim light of a distant dawn? where Sri Lanka will grow its own food and most people would have home gardens where they could grow vegetables and fruits without using poisonous chemicals as fertilisers, weedicides or pesticides. But that did not happen and today we see the devastating consequences of importing junk foods or fake foods while using excessive stocks of imported chemical fertilisers, weedicides and pesticides most of which are toxic.? ?
In a TV interview this week Social Welfare and Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage said that despite widespread urbanisation and the building of hundreds of apartment complexes, there were still thousands of hectares of home gardens where eco friendly, responsible citizens could grow their own non-polluted vegetables and fruits and even medicinal plants. By doing this we hope that many people would go beyond selfishness, self-interest or petty party politics and help in the battle against climate change or global warming.? ?

Police acting similar to 'bulls in the China shop': SF
	
The Police are playing the fool using the freedom given by the yahapalana government, Wildlife and Regional Development Minister Sarath Foinseka told Parliament yesterday.
He said this during the debate on the provincial delimitation commission report and pointed out that some senior police officers were acting similar to ?Bulls in the china shop?.
The minister pointed his finger at STF Chief DIG Lathif and few other police officers. ?STF Chief DIG Lathif is a real bull in the china shop because he is harassing innocent youth who are supporting me,? he said.
The minister said one of his supporters in Kelaniya was arrested by the police on false allegations that he had been having narcotic drugs.
?The STF raided my supporter?s house in Kelaniya and started searching saying they got a tip off that he has drugs in his possession. However they failed to recover any from inside the house but had found a packet of cocaine on a river bank some 80 meters away from the house. STF raided the house for the second time some days later saying my supporter was keeping bombs but only found an old grenade inside a gutter. Another supporter of mine has been falsely arrested. This particular supporter is engaged in hiring machinery. He keeps the national identity cards of his customers as a guarantee. However he has been arrested for stealing identity cards,? he said.
The minister said STF Chief DIG Lathif is behind all these false arrests. ?I took this matter up with the Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara and the latter informed the DIG not to harass innocent people. However DIG Lathif continues harassing them,? he said. ?There is no point in shouting saying there is yahapalanaya in this country if we fail to discipline the police."
However, he admitted that some of his supporters have been engaged in crime in the past but had now reformed themselves.
To a question asked by MP Wimal Weerawansa whether he had not informed his leader, the minister said he had spoken to the the Prime Minister about it and he had promised to investigate. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

## Title: Significance of Nikini Full Moon Poya Day Commencement of the first convocation ?Sangayana?

Significance of Nikini Full Moon Poya Day Commencement of the first convocation ?Sangayana?
	
?
The attainment of Arahantship by Buddha?s Agraupastayake - Chief Attendant, Ven. Ananda Maha Thera, the commencement of the first Dharma Sangayana and the convocation to settle the Buddhist cannon ?Pasu Vas? or the commencement of the ?Vas? period -- rainy season sojourn by Buddhist monks who have not commenced it on the Esala Full Moon Poya Day -- are some of the significant occasions marked on the Nikini Full Moon Poya Day.?
?
RAINY SEASON SOJOURN BY ASCETICS - PERA VAS AND PASU VAS?
The rainy season in Dambadiva, India begins during the month of Esala (July/August). It is extremely cold in the snowy peaks of Himalayas and in the valleys where ascetics meditate under the shade of trees. Due to cold weather and heavy rain, it is not convenient for ascetics to sit under trees and meditate. Even birds build sheltered nests to live in during this season. Some of them even migrate to other countries where there is less rain and where the cold is not so severe. There is provision for Buddhist monks also to sojourn with householders during this season.?
The Pali word ?Vas? means rain and ?Viseema? means dwelling. Hence ?Vas Viseema? means the sojourn during the rainy season of three months which begins on Esala Full Moon Poya Day. Commencing the vas on this day is called the ?Purmikawa? or Pera Vas. However, the Buddhist monks who fail to commence their vas period on the Esala Full Moon Poya Day are allowed to start observing Vas on Nikini Full Moon Poya Day. This late commencement of Vas or rainy season sojourn is called ?Pasu Vas.??
?
SANTHAHA KARANAYA ? HARDSHIPS CAUSED TO MONKS DUE TO RAIN?
Buddhist monks commence their ?Vas? on Nikini Full Moon Poya Day in keeping with the enactment ?Santhaha Karanaya.? The circumstances which led to the enactment of Santhaha Karanaya were the hardships caused to some Bhikkhus due to rain. After the establishment of the Buddha Sasana, Bhikkhus engaged in the propagation of Dharma and meditation during all four seasons -- spring, summer, autumn and winter -- in spite of adverse weather conditions during the rainy season.?
People were concerned about the hardships caused to Bhikkhus and pains taken by them which they thought was ?Attakilamathanuyogaya? ? giving extreme pain to the body or physical exertion. Some people went to the extent of criticizing the extreme pains taken by Bhikkhus. These criticisms reached the ears of King Bimbisara.?
?
VAS IN RAJAGAHANUWARA COMMENCING FROM NIKINI FULL MOON POYA?
On the day before the Nikini Full Moon Poya Day, King Bimbisara requested the Buddha to sojourn for the rainy season in his kingdom - Rajagahanuwara from Nikini Full Moon Poya Day. The Enlightened One accepted this invitation. ?Pasuvas? or the custom of sojourning for the rainy season from Nikini Full Moon Poya came into being in that manner. Thus, Bhikkhus who fail to commence ?Vaswiseema? or sojourning for the rainy season from Esala Full Moon Poya Day can sojourn for the Vassana Kala from Nikini Full Moon Poya Day.?
Buddha himself had to be away from his place of rainy season sojourning for about a week when he went to Rajagahanuwara on the invitation of King Bimbisara. On this occasion, the Enlightened One allowed his followers to be away from the place of rainy season sojourn for a week if they had to comply with the invitation of devotees.?
?
THE FIRST DHARMA SANGAYANA?
It was on the Nikini Full Moon Poya Day, three months after the Buddha ?Parinibbana? that the first Dharma Sangayana or the convocation was held to protect the Buddhist cannon. The immediate cause for conducting the first convocation or Dharma Sangayana was the behaviour of a monk by the name of Subaddha after Parinibbana of the Enlightened One.?
?
LAMENTATION OVER PARINIBBANA OF THE ENLIGHTENED ONE?
All ordinary bhikkhus who had not attained Arahantship excepting monk Subaddha lamented over the Parinibbana of the Buddha. Buddha?s Agra Upasthayake, ?Dharma Bhandagarika?- the treasurer of Dharma, Ananda Maha Thera was among those who lamented. Monk Subaddha had become an ascetic during his old age not actually to practice it but because he had no other way of living. He had requested the monks not to mourn but to be happy as there was no one after Buddha to give them orders.?
?
REASON TO HOLD THE FIRST CONVOCATION?
Arahants led by Maha Kassapa Thera felt that the behaviour of ascetic Subaddha was an indication of problems among members of the Sangha community and on Esala Full Moon Poya Day, two months after the Parinibbana of the Buddha, decided to hold the convocation to settle the Buddhist cannon. This was the first Dharma Sangayana.?
It was conducted during a period of seven months from the following Nikini Full Moon Poya Day. Even during the time of Buddha, problems arose among the Bhikkhus such as the ?Sangha Beddha? or division among bhikkhus (those versed in morals) and ?Vinayadhara? bhikkhus (those versed in and observed the precepts of property of conduct) but the Buddha settled them amicably.?
?
ARAHANT MAHA KASSAPA THERA?
Arahant Maha Kassapa Thera was a Bhikkhu who spent most of the time in Himalayas as an ascetic. This he did presumably to avoid being mistaken by the people for the Buddha as he was physically identical with the ?Thathagatha.??
Maha Kassapa Thera was in the city of Pavaat the time of Buddha?s Parinibbana. As soon as he heard about the Maha Parinibbana, he came to Kusinara with his followers. Maha Kassapa Thera consoled the ordinary monks who mourned the Parinibbana of Gautama Buddha and after the funeral of the Thathagatha he made arrangements for the first Dharma Sangayana.?
By that time Arahant Sariputta and Arahant Moggallyana had attained Parinibbana and the convocation was held under the patronage of Arahant Maha Kassapa and the royal patronage was provided by King Ajasatta. As unanimously decided by all the Bhikkhus, the first convocation was held at Saptapanni cave at the foot of the ?Vehara rock? Rajagahanuwara, Five hundred Arahants participated in the convocation. Arahant Maha Kassapa Thera originally selected 499 Arahants and after attaining Arahantship by Ananda Maha Thera on the previous day the vacancy was filled by him.?
The convocation was held at Rajagahanuwara in Magadha Rata. Presumably, Arahant Maha Kassapa Thera was confident of Ananda Maha Thera?s attainment of Arahantship before the commencement of the Dharma Sangayana. It was because of this reason that a place was kept for him.?
?
ATTAINMENT OF ARAHANTSHIP BY ANANDA MAHA THERA?
Ananda Maha Thera had gained eminence in erudition and possessed a lot of knowledge in Dharma and was second only to Buddha in preaching. Buddha appreciated him when he preached Dharma to a group led by King Mahanama Sakya. He was ?Dharma Bhandagarika? - treasurer of Dharma having heard all the discourses of the Buddha. He was second only to Buddha in intelligence, good sense, prudence and circumspection. He had reached the apex in understanding and apprehension. In serving as ?Agra Upasthayake? - Buddha?s chief attendant, he did everything possible for the safety and comfort of the Buddha.?
?
ANANDA MAHA THERA?S DETERMINATION TO SAVE BUDDHA FROM ELEPHANT NALAGIRI?
When the furious elephant Nalagiri came chasing after the Buddha, the Thera stood in between the Buddha and the elephant exhibiting his courageousness when he felt the need. He was second only to Buddha in rationalism, prudence and wisdom. In spite of such virtues and good qualities, he did not attain Arahantship by the time of Buddha?s Parinibbana, presumably due to his desire and ambition to tender aid, to serve and wait upon the Buddha.?
He had attained ?Sowan? - the first of four paths to Nirvana, having heard the Dharma preached by Arahant Punnamattanipatha Thera a few days after entering priesthood. Since he had not attained Arahantship, he could not bear the pain of mind when he heard about Buddha?s decision to attain Parinibbana. He leaned against the door at the temple and started crying.?
?
ANANDA THERA REMINDED ABOUT THE TRANSITORY NATURE OF ALL EXISTING THINGS?
Buddha summoned Ananda Maha Thera and consoled him, reminding him about the transitory nature of all existing things from which even the Thathagatha cannot deviate. Buddha said Ananda Maha Thera had accumulated enough merit to attain Arahantship before long and advised him to be courageous. Ananda Maha Thera made up his mind and did everything what ought to have been done.?
?
ANANDA MAHA THERA INDISPENSABLE FOR THE CONVOCATION?
When the first Dharma Sangayana was held, Ananda Maha Thera attained Arahantship and was qualified to fill the vacancy kept reserved for him by Arahant Maha Kassapa Thera. The vacancy was kept reserved because Ananda Maha Thera was indispensable for the successful convocation of the?
Buddhist cannon.?
He was the most knowledgeable person in the doctrine being the ?Dharma Bhandagarika?- the treasurer of Dharma and having listened to all the discourses of the Enlightened One.?
?
SEVEN MONTHS SPENT FOR THE CONVOCATION?
The convocation went on for seven months. Dharma Pitake and Vinaya Pitake were classified into Digha Nikaya, Majjima Nikaya, Sanyutta Nikaya, Anguttara Nikaya and Kuddaka Nikaya.?
They were learnt by heart. The responsibility for each part was entrusted to leading participants of the convocation. Arahant Ananda Maha Thera and his followers were entrusted with the responsibility for Digha Nikaya. The followers of Arahant Sariputta Maha Thera were entrusted with the Majjima Nikaya. Sanyutta Nikaya was entrusted with Arahant Kassapa Maha Thera and his followers.
Anguttara Nikaya was the responsibility of Arahant Anuruddha Maha Thera and his followers. All the Theras were made responsible for the Kuddaka Nikaya. Vinaya Pitake was entrusted with Arahant Upali Maha Thera. At this convocation, the preludes or introduction to Dharma Sangati, Vibhanga Dhatukata, Puggala Pragnappti and Yamaka Pattan of Abhidharma were also rehearsed.?
?
PANCA SATHIKA SANGIKTHI?
This convocation was called ?Panca Sathika Sangikthi? as it was held with the participation of 500 Theras who had?attained Arahantship.?

SLFP dissidents: CC to decide on necessary action
	
If the 16 SLFP disidents continue to sabotage the SLFP, the party?s central committee decide on the steps to be taken about them before the SLFP?s annual convention to be held in October, Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
He told reporters that he did not know how many members still remain in this group because the numbers steadily declining.
?Former minister Dayasiri Jayasekara is not with the group now. Former deputy speaker Thilanga Sumathipala closely associates with party leader and President, Maithripala Sirisena. Several others are also not supporting the group. But there are a few who have their feet in both camps and criticize the SLFP led by the President. They are also hoping to bring the SLPP and former president Mahinda Rajapaksa to power. The SLFP cannot take anymore of this. Therefore, I believe the CC will take a decision on the traitors," the minister said.
He said a recent survey conducted by the SLFP revealed that certain disidents had done nothing in their respective constituencies or districts to promote, organize or strengthen the party and as such the CC would have take this into account and appoint new electoral and district organizers as the party had to face three crucial elections soon.
?For years they have failed to work as party organizers but worked for the benefit of the SLPP,? the minister said.
Responding to a journalist on what would happen if the delimitation report was not passed in Parliament, he said the Speaker could appoint a five-member parliamentary committee chaired by Prime Minister to review the delimitation report and make recommendations to Parliament in two months enabling the Elections Commission to conduct polls to 6 PCs next year under the old PR system.
?However, if Parliament approves the delimitation report on Friday, many of the obstacles would disappear,? the minister said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

SPIRITUAL FRIENDSHIP
	
?
?Do not associate with evil companions;?
Do not seek the fellowship of the vile.?
?Associate with good friends;?
?Seek the fellowship of noble persons.??
?(Dhammapada)?

When one is inquired about one?s close associate, companion or friend, one should be able to happily affirm it. One should deeply and thoroughly concentrate on one?s own friendship. Some of them are polite and decent or spiritual, but some of them are contrary to it. Today, especially every youth should be very careful and wise enough to choose and select a suitable friend to associate with. It is a crucial fact that solely impacts one?s own life.?
Sometimes, the person who associates with you would either direct you to fortune or misfortune, failure or success. Perhaps, someone?s downfall and success depend on one?s friendship. Many individuals have met numerous challenges in their lives due to lack of spiritual friendship.?
The Buddha was the greatest spiritual teacher who guided and encouraged people to be equipped with the energy of spirituality. He advised everyone to renounce and give up unwholesome activities not only physically but also both verbally and mentally. In that regard, good friendship is very important.?
Relevant to that matter, young men, Kolitha and Upatissa are prominent personalities during the Buddha?s time. Although they assembled together with their associates for social entertainment in their lay lives, they were pursuit of spiritual aspiration, which was why both of them finally understood the vanity and vacuity of amusement and sensual pleasure. Like-mindedness and concordance are prime factors which encouraged them to meet the great master, the Gautama Buddha and finally became the chief disciples of the Buddha. Ven. Sariputta and Ven. Moggallyana are exemplary figures in the history of the dispensation of the Buddha.?
?
Spiritual friends guide and encourage us to be virtuous and righteous. That companionship will guide us towards a very peaceful and happy state here and hereafter
?
Once the Buddha affirmed and asserted to his chief attendant, Venerable Ananda Maha Thera that good friendship was utterly and entirely supportive for the practice of the Dhamma and accomplishment of spiritual aspiration. Bad association leads to evil path and miserable end. Good friendship leads to happy and pleasant path and ultimately settles in a peaceful destination.?
?A mother is the friend in one?s own home? (The Buddha ? Samyutta Nikaya)?
?Monks, one should associate with a friend who possesses seven factors. What seven??
1. He gives what is hard to give.?
2. He does what is hard to do.?
3. He patiently endures what is hard to endure.?
4. He reveals his secret to you.?
5. He preserves your secrets.?
6. He does not forsake you when you are in trouble.?
7. He does not roughly despise you.?
One should associate with a friend who possesses these seven factors.??
?One who associate with inferior person declines?
One who associate with an equal does not decline?
Attending on a superior person one develops quickly?
Therefore you should follow one superior to yourself.??
(The Buddha)?
Once, famous Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore was asked about his friends and he has pointed out his books as his best friends. In fact, good books are good friends.?
On one occasion, Venerable Ananda, the Buddha?s chief attendant, came to the Buddha and said that in his view half the spiritual life revolves around spiritual friendship. The Buddha immediately corrected him and said, ?Do not say this, Ananda! Do not say this, Ananda! Spiritual friendship is not half the spiritual life. It is the entire spiritual life!? Then, with reference to himself, the Buddha added, ?In this whole world, I am the supreme spiritual friend of living beings, because it is in dependence upon me, by relying upon me, that those who are subject to birth, old age and death become liberated from birth, old age and death.??
One should find a spiritual friend who does practice and cultivate wholesome inner qualities. Spiritual person always concentrate on virtuous matter and never engage in any wrongdoing and unwholesome activities.?
If one associates with a person who has an unethical behaviour, one would become the same or end up in a state of turbulence.?
If one associates with a spiritual friend, one would become the same and will have a favourable outcome.?
Spiritual friends guide and encourage us to be virtuous and righteous. That companionship will guide us towards a very peaceful and happy state here and hereafter. Most people concentrate only on this life but Dhamma friend always encourages us to contemplate on next life and many more lives to come.??
The Blessed One firmly explains that it is because of an ?element? that people come together and unite. What is meant by ?element? here is the basic disposition or trait of character. Thus, the Buddha says that those of inferior disposition come together and unite with those of inferior disposition, whereas those of superior disposition come together and unite.?
As parents, they should be kindhearted friends to their children, not only by advising and lecturing them but also by profound examples. I always believe that parents are the role models for our children.?
If parents break and violate the ethics and etiquettes or some precepts in front of children, what can we expect from the young generation? They should speak refined and polite language and behave well. Parents are trainers and mentors. Parents should set the example and lead ideal lives. If they show the way correctly with compassion and respect, children will follow their footsteps.?
That is why the great master, the Buddha, encouraged parents to perform exemplary duties such as dissuading from immoral activities and persuading to do good and wholesome deeds. Giving a decent education comes as the third duty of the parents.?
Unfortunately, most parents never concentrate on spirituality or any moral conduct of their child or children but they always struggle to force their children to accomplish only academic qualification. Some incidents and findings have revealed that it is an utter failure of parents. As a Buddhist monk, I must say that Buddhist monks should be Dhamma and spiritual teachers for their devotees and children who compassionately provide all requisites and necessities for their survival.?
I would like to state that Most Venerable Ampitiye Sri Rahula Maha Thera was my spiritual teacher from the prime of my youth before I became his disciple. Though I lived nearly 200 kilometres away from his monastery, he communicated with me through letters. His numerous advices, encouragements and guidance are still resounding in my mind. That was a classic example which is personally related to me.?
As a Buddhist monk our mission should be different from lay people.?
If a Buddhist monk involves in politics and other inappropriate activities which provoke and exasperate disharmony, discord and conflict in our society, it will be unsuitable and disastrous for the Buddhist monk and the golden opportunity we have got as Buddhist monks to serve the humanity will be lost.?
Once well-known French writer, historian and philosopher Voltaire said: ?Lord, protect me from my friends; I know how to protect me from my enemies.??
?If one finds someone who points out faults and who reproves, one should follow such a wise and sagacious person as one would a guide to hidden treasure. It is always better, never worse, to cultivate such an association.??

Northern Province Chief Minister Canagasabapathy Viswalingam Wigneswaran is a retired Supreme Court judge. Much was expected of CV Wigneswaran when he was first elected chief minister of the Northern Province on behalf of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) in September 2013. Sadly those hopes turned into dupes very soon. Wigneswaran adopted a confrontational political approach that left much to be desired. Projecting himself as a Tamil hardliner, the chief minister engaged in all types of disruptive politics while the Northern provincial administration deteriorated. The Northern Provincial Council (NPC) became the worst-run provincial administration in the country. Today the NPC board of ministers is in a virtual state of paralysis due to Wigneswaran?s obstinate refusal to comply with a court directive. The people of the North who welcomed the advent of the NPC in 2013 are waiting eagerly for its term of office to end in October 2018.??

?
The provincial councils of Sri Lanka do enjoy a certain quantum of devolution. They may not have maximum devolution but the powers available are adequate to plan and implement a reasonable amount of development projects. The provincial council representing the war-afflicted people of the war-ravaged North had an extra responsibility and duty to harness all available resources for the betterment of the province. But this is not what happened. Instead of passing necessary statutes, the NPC busied itself with passing hundreds of useless, irrelevant resolutions. Finances allocated by the Treasury for development work in the province were under-utilised resulting in the remainder being returned to the Treasury. When major projects with international aid for the benefit of the North were initiated by the Government in Colombo, the NPC did not cooperate and instead obstructed them. When concerned Sri Lankan expatriates came up with blueprints to establish employment-oriented, income-generating schemes they were rebuffed and rejected. The credo adopted by Wigneswaran and his cohorts was ?Abilaashaigalae Mukkiam, Abhiviruthiyalla? (Aspirations are only important not Development).??
There was a sinister method in this seeming madness. Wigneswaran may have been a Supreme Court judge but he proved to be absolutely incompetent as a chief minister and was thoroughly inefficient as an administrator. His tough political posture helped divert attention away from his inadequacies and failures. More importantly his conduct seemed to be part of a calculated design, endorsed and encouraged by hawkish elements in the global Tamil Diaspora.
?Hardliners in the Tamil Diaspora and their fellow-travellers in Sri Lanka have a three-fold objective. Firstly they want to sabotage the working of the Northern Provincial Council and depict it as a worthless white elephant incapable of delivering the goods to the Tamil people. Secondly they want to prevent economic, educational, social and cultural upliftment of the Tamil people and keep them in a state of perpetual want and despair. Thirdly they don?t want normalcy to prevail in the Northern and Eastern provinces and try as much as possible to foment violence and strife in the Tamil- speaking regions. The various attempts to trigger violence in the North-East have been contained and checked by the law-enforcement authorities in the past. However the goals of making the Northern Provincial Council dysfunctional and preventing a socio-economic renaissance through development activities have succeeded to some extent due to Chief minister Wigneswaran and a few provincial councillors, some officials and sections of the Tamil media.??
?
Premier Political Configuration
This sad state of affairs does not mean that the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) which is the premier political configuration of the Sri Lankan Tamils, approves of all what Wigneswaran has been doing. The chief constituent of the TNA is the Ilankai Thamil Arasuk Katchi (ITAK). The TNA contests elections under the House symbol of the ITAK. The ITAK president and senior Jaffna district MP Somasundaram ?Maavai? Senathirajah and TNA spokesperson and Jaffna district parliamentarian MA Sumanthiran have been openly critical of Wigneswaran. Sumanthiran in fact called for disciplinary action against Wigneswaran for allegedly violating party discipline. There is little love lost between NPC Chairman C.V.K. Sivagnanam and Chief Minister CV Wigneswaran who are often at loggerheads with each other. Three out of four in the original board of ministers were opposed to the chief minister. One has successfully filed legal action against the chief minister. Most of the ITAK representatives in the NPC are hostile to Wigneswaran and estranged from him. On another level the NPC Opposition Leader Sinnathurai Thavarajah exposes the alleged lies, half truths, contradictions and shortcomings of chief minister Wigneswaran both within and outside the provincial council. Wigneswaran has been unable to get along with the present Northern Governor Reginald Coorayas well as past Governors H.M.G.S. Palihakkara and Maj-Gen (Retd) G. A. Chandrasiri.??
In spite of all this opposition towards him within the ITAK which nominated him as chief ministerial candidate, Wigneswaran has been able to carry on as chief minister so far due to the strength and support of TNA parliamentary group leader and Leader of the Opposition Rajavarothayam Sampanthan. For reasons which shall be discussed in detail later, Sampanthan has been mollycoddling, shielding and protecting Wigneswaran from the ?slings and arrows? of disgruntled ITAK party members in the past. In 2015 Sampanthan restrained efforts by TNA provincial councillors to present a no-confidence motion against Wigneswaran. In 2017 Sampanthan was taken unawares when a ?sudden? no-confidence motion against Wigneswaran was put to the vote. Sampanthan however intervened and prevented further follow-up action against the chief minister. According to Hindu mythology the snake around Lord Shiva?s neck (Paramasivan Kazhuthup Paambu)feels secure enough to tauntingly greet its sworn enemy the brahmini kite bird (Karudan). Likewise Wigneswaran protected by Sampanthan has been able to cock a snook at his critics within the TNA so far.??
The silver lining in this dark cloud seems to be the prospect of ?change? looming on the horizon. In spite of the octogenarian Sampanthan?s authoritative hold on the party there are increasing signs of assertive independence within the parliamentary folds of the party. Parliamentarians of the TNA are no longer ready, able and willing to follow Sampanthan blindly. This was vividly illustrated at the time of the deputy-speaker?s election a few months ago.
?
This sad state of affairs does not mean that the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) which is the premier political configuration of the Sri Lankan Tamils, approves of all what Wigneswaran has been doing
The deputy-speaker?s post fell vacant after Thilanga Sumathipala along with 16 SLFP parliamentarians quit Government ranks in the aftermath of the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Sumathipala resigned as deputy-speaker on May 25, 2018. Since the Speaker Karu Jayasuriya is from the UNP the Deputy-speaker post was allocated to the SLFP. Therefore the vacancy should have been filled by that party.??
?
Deputy Speaker?s Election??
President Maithripala Sirisena wanted to nominate national list MP Angajan Ramanathan as the SLFP deputy-speaker. But Sampanthan objected to Ramanathan who was the SLFP chief organizer in Jaffna being appointed deputy speaker. President Sirisena then gave in and the UNP nominated Moneragala district MP Ananda Kumarasiri for the deputy speaker. The ?SLFP group of 16 MP?s? who had quit the government nominated Gampaha district MP Dr. Sudharshini Fernandopulle for the post and canvassed with both the SLFP in government and within the joint opposition. The 16 MP?s also had discussions with Sampanthan at which meeting no other MP from TNA was present. It was reported then that the? SLFP sixteen? had assured Sampanthan that they had no objection to him continuing to remain opposition leader.??
When the deputy speaker election was to be held, Sampanthan spoke out against the UNP candidate and extolled the virtues of Dr. Sudharshini Fernandopulle who would have made history as the first woman deputy speaker if elected. Furthermore Sampanthan said that the deputy? speaker post should go to the SLFP and faulted the UNP for contesting. A chagrined Ranil Wickremesinghe retorted by pointing out that it was Sampanthan who had vetoed the earlier SLFP nominee Angajan Ramanathan. When it came to voting time, Sampanthan indicated that the TNA would vote in favour of Sudharshani Fernandopulle.
This was an arbitrary decision of Sampanthan who had not consulted the TNA parliamentary group. Most of the TNA parliamentarians spontaneously revolted against Sampanthan by telling TNA spokesman Sumanthiran that they will not vote for Sudharshini. The TNA parliamentarians voted with their feet by walking out en masse. Sampanthan too was compelled to save face by following his fellow MP?s reluctantly.??
A seemingly similar situation of TNA parliamentarians defying Sampanthan on crucial issues may have developed on Thursday August 23 too. Fortunately it was averted by Sampanthan himself who fell in line with the opinion of his fellow MP?s instead of trying to impose his will upon them. Again the controversial bone of contention was Wigneswaran. The issue was about the Task force appointed by President Maithripala Sirisena to oversee development work in the Northern and Eastern provinces.??
?
Presidential Task Force??
President Maithripala Sirisena had earlier appointed a high-level 48-member task force to direct, coordinate and monitor development activities in the Northern and Eastern Provinces. The task force, chaired by the President, would review the development projects so far launched in the Northern and Eastern Provinces since the end of the conflict and accelerate the development process.The task force members included Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, 15 Cabinet ministers, the Governors of the two provinces, the Chief Ministers of the two provinces, secretaries to several ministries and Commanders of the Army, Navy and Air Force.? ?
The task force is expected to review the status of progress of various sectoral plans, programmes and projects now being implemented in the two Provinces. It would also initiate and formulate new plans, programmes and subjects targeting sectors and groups that need priority attention. It will facilitate finances for projects and programmes and encourage and enlist the support and participation of the private sector, bilateral and multilateral development institutions, for investing and implementing development projects and programmes in the two Provinces.??
The task force will also coordinate work between the Government and provincial administrations and among Public and private sectors and non-governmental and civil society sections and carry out overall monitoring of the implementation of the development activities in the regions.It will also identify any constraints which impede expeditious implementation of development programmes in the regions and advise the relevant authorities on speedy solutions to overcome them. Former Rehabilitation Ministry Secretary V. Sivagnanasothy has been appointed as the task force secretary.??
A singular defect in constituting the Task force was the apparent exclusion of Parliamentarians. No elected or appointed MP from the Northern and Eastern provinces was appointed to the Task force. It is uncertain as to whether this omission was deliberate or merely an inadvertent oversight. The two chief ministers and Governors were included. There was a hitch in this too as the Eastern Provincial council is now dissolved and there is no chief minister. The Northern Provincial council?s term of office too is scheduled to end in October this year. Thus Wigneswaran as chief minister was entitled to participate in the task force.??
?
Track Record of Non-Cooperation
Any responsible chief minister of a war-battered province and war-shattered people would have jumped at the chance to be part of a Presidential task force overseeing development activity. But Wigneswaran with a track record of non - cooperation said he would boycott it. He cited the exclusion of TNA parliamentarians and inclusion of defence services chiefs in the Task Force as reasons for his decision. He also reiterated that a political settlement was necessary before economic development. It was apparent that the Northern Province chief minister was all out to undermine the Presidential Task force charged with Provincial development.??
Saner counsel prevailed within the upper echelons of the TNA who did not take umbrage at being kept out of the Task Force. Instead of confronting, the president and Prime Minister were informed by the TNA that parliamentarians from the North - East had to be accommodated in the Task Force as the Eastern Provincial council stood dissolved and the Northern Provincial council term of office would end in October. Thus participation of elected Parliamentary representatives from the two provinces was essential for the smooth functioning of the Task Force. This was accepted and the composition of the Task Force was enlarged to accommodate MP?s also. Invitation letters were sent out to the 16 MP?s elected from the TNA to participate in the Task Force meetings.( Wanni district MP Sivasakthi Ananthan has dropped?out of the TNA).??
?The main reason cited by Wigneswran in refusing to attend the Task Force meetings was the non-inclusion of TNA parliamentarians in it. Now the matter had been rectified. Even though his stated raison d?etre for spurning the Task Force was now removed, Wigneswaran remained adamant. He wrote a letter to President Sirisena saying he would not participate in the Task Force and released it to the media. He also called upon the TNA not to attend Task Force meetings. Wigneswaran began exerting pressure on TNA leader Sampanthan to comply with his call for a boycott.??
?
?Politics First;Economics Next???
An official from the chief minister?s office in Jaffna contacted Leader of the opposition Rajavarothayam Sampanthan and informed him that Wigneswaran would be in Colombo on Sunday August 26th. It was suggested that Sampanthan and Wigneswaran should meet in Colombo on Aug 26th and discuss issues including the Economic Task Force matter. Wigneswaran also wrote a personal letter to Sampanthan on August 22nd. Wigneswaran informed Sampanthan that he was boycotting the Presidential Task Force and wanted Sampanthan and other TNA parliamentarians to do the same. He said that the quest for a political settlement should receive priority over economic upliftment activity. Wigneswaran urged Sampanthan to adopt the principle of ?Arasiyal Theervu Mudhalil; Porulaathaara Munnetram Adhan Pinnar? (Political Solution First;Economic Progress Next).??
It was against this backdrop that the TNA parliamentary group met in Colombo on Thursday August 23. The meeting was held in the morning at the opposition leaders office in Parliament with Sampanthan presiding. Eleven of sixteen TNA Parliamentarians were present. The five absentee MP?s were Dharmalingam Siddharthan, Sivasakthi Ananthan, E.Saravanabavaan, Dr. S. Sivamohan and Ms. Shanthy Sriskandarajah. When the Economic Task Force issue was taken up Sampanthan informed the MP?s of Wigneswaran?s call for a boycott and read out portions of his letter. Sampanthan also said that a meeting with Wigneswaran on Sunday was on the cards.??

?
Sampanthan was somewhat taken aback by the vehement reaction of his party MP?s to Wigneswaran?s boycott call. Almost every MP present condemned Wigneswaran?s boycott call and emphasised that TNA parliamentarians should participate fully in the Task Force and ensure the speedy economic upliftment of the people. They pointed out that the people were facing much economic hardship and that the economic task force provided a very good opportunity for the MP?s to remove bottlenecks and enact positive measures. Some Northern MP?s pointed out that the Provincial council with chief minister Wigneswaran was elected to work out schemes and projects for the economic emancipation of the people but Wigneswaran had neglected his duties and engaged in?
disruptive politics.?
They said that because of this, they as MP?s had a duty to cooperate with the Govt and ensure the economic needs of the people were met. Wigneswaran was also criticised for interfering with the political duties of TNA parliamentarians. One MP quipped that Wigneswaran like the fox in the fable was asking them to cut their tails because he had lost his own tail.?
?
?
Politically Isolated Within Party??
The rising tide of discontent and criticism displayed against Wigneswaran demonstrated clearly that the TNA parliamentarians were in an angry mood. It also showed that Wigneswaran was becoming politically isolated within the party that elected him as chief minister. After each MP had his say, Sampanthan addressed the parliamentary group. The veteran Trincomalee district MP said that he too was of the opinion that the TNA should participate in the Task force instead of boycotting and cooperate with the govt to develop the North and East. Thereafter the TNA parliamentary group passed a unanimous resolution rejecting Wigneswaran?s boycott call and emphasising that all MP?s should participate whole-heartedly in the Task Force to expedite the economic progress of the people in the Northern and Eastern provinces.??
The antipathy of the TNA parliamentarians towards the politics of Wigneswaran was so great that some of them even asked Sampanthan not to communicate with the chief minister about the TNA parliamentary group decision. They told the TNA leader respectfully that if Wigneswaran approached Sampanthan then the chief minister could be informed about what had happened but it was not necessary for him to inform Wigneswaran first. They also requested Sampanthan not to reply Wigneswaran?s letter in writing and to simply ignore it. When some MP?s raised the matter of an envisaged meeting between Sampanthan and Wigneswaran, the TNA leader was quick to respond ?He has only requested that we meet. I have said I will only consider it. I have not agreed yet?. It appears therefore that the chances of a one to one meeting between Sampanthan - Wigneswaran meeting are very slim.??
The TNA parliamentary group hullabaloo over Wigneswaran?s political conduct and the unanimous rejection of his boycott call illustrates clearly that the Northern chief minister is increasingly becoming politically isolated within the TNA in general and ITAK in particular. Wigneswaran?s sheet anchor within the party and benefactor -protector has been TNA leader Sampanthan. Although Wigneswaran has bitten the hand that fed him on more than one occasion, the diplomatic Sampanthan has been extremely patient and tolerant about the chief minister?s antics. There are two reasons for this stance. One is that Wigneswaran was brought into politics and crowned chief minister by Sampanthan. Though Wigneswaran runs amok at times, Sampanthan does not find fault publicly because he does not want to acknowledge the fact that he had erred grievously in his choice of a chief minister. The second reason is Sampanthan?s concern that Wigneswaran may break away and align with other forces thereby endangering and fracturing overall Tamil political unity.??
?
Three Options Before Wigneswaran??
Wigneswaran too has been relying on Sampanthan in this respect. The chief minister has made it clear that he intends repeating his dismal performance by becoming chief minister for a second time too. Wigneswaran has said that he has three options before him. The first is to be nominated by the TNA/ITAK as chief ministerial candidate again. The second is to align with like minded parties and individuals and form a new political front and contest. The third is to form his own political party and contest. Notwithstanding the triple choices outlined by Wigeswaran, his preference is to be the TNA/ITAK chief ministerial candidate. His references to the second and third options is only a calculated ruse to intimidate and compel Sampanthan into giving him the chief minister nomination again. That is why he has not engaged in any spadework to form a new party or shown signs of aligning with other parties. He has been pointedly ignoring the public pleas of Tamil Congress leader Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam that Wigneswaran should take a firm decision and team up with him.??
Recent events however show that the political isolation of Wigneswaran within the party is so great that even Sampanthan may not be able to help him out in this regard. The anger and resentment towards Wigneswaran within party circles is of gigantic proportions. Hence Sampanthan may very likely face an internal revolt if he dares to nominate Wigneswaran as chief ministerial candidate again. Besides ITAK leader and senior Jaffna district MP ?Maavai? Senathirajah has staked his rightful claim to be the Chief ministerial candidate at the next elections. In 2013 the overwhelming desire in the TNA was for Senathirajah to be the chief minister candidate. Sampanthan however insisted that Wigneswaran should be the candidate. Senathiraja gracefully stepped down in deference to Sampanthan?s wishes. This time Senathirajah is determined to contest and even Sampanthan cannot replace Maavai with Wigneswaran even if he wants to. But there is little chances of Sampanthan backing Wigneswaran this time because the veteran politician will not support what appears to be a lost cause.??
In such a situation it is obvious that Wigneswaran has fallen from grace politically within party folds. He has his coterie of supporters in Sri Lanka and abroad nd also the backing of sections of the Tamil media. These elements have succeeded in projecting a larger than life image of Wigneswaran. An illusion has been created that Wigneswaran is widely popular and that any party or political front supported by him would be victorious. This however is a myth. The ex - Judge who got more than 130,000 preferences when he contested Provincial polls on the ITAK ticket in 2013 will find his vote tally drastically reduced if he dares to go against the TNA/ITAK. Of course he and his supporters can win a few seats but it will not be adequate to make him chief minister. The majority of people in the North are so disappointed and disgusted with Wigneswaran?s performance as chief minister that they are unwilling for a repeat performance again. The bloated balloon blown up by Wigneswaran?s acolytes will burst in such a trial of strength. It is a moot point as to whether Wigneswaran will have the political courage to venture on such a risky political course despite his verbal bravado.The ITAK however seems ready to call his bluff this time.??
?
Writing is on the Wall?
It appears therefore that the days of CV Wigneswaran as Northern Province chief minister are numbered. Politically isolated within his party, the chief minister appears to be on his way out permanently. The TNA parliamentary group reaction to the chief minister?s boycott call shows that the writing is on the wall for Wigneswaran. A political downfall seems inevitable unless of course something unexpected happens.
