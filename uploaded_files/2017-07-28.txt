?There are 7 orifices on the face.?
Great thinkers and intellectuals
Number 7 people born on the 7th, 16th or the 25th of the month are idealists. ?They live more in the world of imagination than in the real world. ?They achieve much spiritually, but their materialistic achievements are few and far between.

## Title: Against a culture of ambivalence
## Section: News Features

Against a culture of ambivalence
	
For obvious reasons, the government wants to convince us that its enemies and friends are also the people?s. Obvious, because in equalising the one with the other we are on firm ground. Obvious, because if my enemy is your enemy, the world is easier to simplify, and the decision by an official body is easier to rationalise. Obvious, because if you kill your enemy and he or she happens to be my enemy as well, everything becomes a whole lot easier to sweep under the carpet. That is how totalitarian dictatorships work. And to an extent, that is also how democracies work. ?
When a movement, an ideology, or an individual is hard to define, harder to oppose or support on the political plane, he or she or it is portrayed rather ambivalently by the government and the opposition. Much of the hype around the SAITM crisis (born of the previous regime), for instance, can be rooted in how we, the people, and those whom we have elected vilify or valorise the student movement. The government is suffering from a headache due to that movement. The Joint Opposition is having a field day. Lahiru Weerasekara is, on that count, a contemporary Rohana Wijeweera to both sides. He is a hero to the State University student population regardless of their politics, a convenience to the JO, and a pain to the government. ?
If there?s anything that can aggravate a social ill beyond its limits, it?s ambivalence. Ambivalence in negotiation and agreement, in identification and resolution, in diagnosis and prognosis. It was ambivalence which prolonged a conflict which could have been easily done away with to a 30-year war. It was ambivalence which took away 100,000 lives within three years, far greater than the number killed in that civil war. And it was ambivalence which led us to this cul-de-sac between private and public education. Weerasekara is the perfect symbol of all that. He is despised by those who hate him and only mildly liked by those who hate his opponents.
Our political culture has thrived on rhetoric for too long. We are awed by what our leaders say, and then get tired of finding out that what they say isn?t what they do. ?
Popular culture has worsened this cul-de-sac. But then that?s to be expected. Popular culture knows how to distort reality to achieve its arbitrary ends. This isn?t something particular to Sri Lanka only, after all even the United States of America suffers from it when it comes to its own president, depicted on the one hand as a harbinger against elitism by the same people who oppose him, and on the other as a populist demagogue who?s hiding that same elitism he rants against (in both instances, he sells). But we are a small country, small enough for even the smallest act of ambiguity to spell out drastic consequences. Which is why, when the ruckus over SAITM is spelt out in vague terms, we should be wary of those consequences. ?
And it?s not just the SAITM crisis, of course. Just look at how we are handling our PR when it comes to the international community. On the one hand, we have a set of representatives who seem to be conceding to the process of capitulation we are giving into with respect to institutions skewed against us. On the other hand, you have another set of representatives, sometimes even from the same political party, lambasting (mildly or otherwise) those same institutions. Who?s saying what, and what should we believe? Isn?t this just like the war years, when capitulation was described horrendously as negotiation and when negotiation was robbed of its meaning via an unhelpfully vague series of discussions and peace talks? ?
The biggest thorn on the side of the government is its lack of clarity. The previous regime had a convenient tool at its disposal to make us forget this. Nationalism. Rabble-rousing, populist, irrational nationalism. The current regime doesn?t have that privilege, especially since despite the many representatives who (claim they) are for a unitary state, freedom from external interference etc, we are led by a set of leaders who are more pragmatic than nationalist (whether or not it constitutes actual pragmatism being another debate altogether). In effect, consequently, there?s nothing the government can resort to so as to hide their indefiniteness. ?
And to top it all, the regime is trying to please everyone without pleasing anyone. It doesn?t take a political scientist to figure out that when federalists, nationalists, and members of that self-labelled intelligentsia which operates in Colombo want a piece of the pie shouting ?We voted you in, give us what we want!? there?s bound to be a lack of focus. In this process of trying to give everything to everyone, there are winners and there are losers. The winners are the rent-seekers. The losers are the people. And the moment compelling social problems are swept under the carpet, unresolved and etched in uncertain terms, they lose even more. This we ought to know. ?
Getting back to my earlier point, the student movement, like Donald Trump, sells whichever way and however positively or negatively you view them. They sell because, as heroes, they are pelted by what Marxists and other ideologues would call a ?police state? and, as villains, they themselves pelt those they disagree with. In both cases, there?s publicity involved. Publicity, ladies and gentlemen. The kind that prolongs an issue because, for interested parties, there?s money and popularity to be milked. Clarity can be a wonderful thing. Unfortunately, we lack it in this case. ?
Our political culture has thrived on rhetoric for too long. We are awed by what our leaders say, and then get tired of finding out that what they say isn?t what they do. A pragmatic government wouldn?t have, for instance, dithered over the Office of Missing Persons with vague declarations. A pragmatic government would have marketed the OMP notwithstanding the hype for and against it. Like the Right to Information Act, the OMP Bill, even with the president?s signature, was born prematurely, disliked even by those who agree with its provisions simply because of the way it was brought through. When vagueness and confusion take over the process of crystallising Acts of Parliament, we can?t really blame those who lambast them. ?
Rhetoric is one thing, however. Lack of focus is another. When we put the two together, we get what Gunadasa Amarasekara once cogently described as a kavandaya (or headless corpse): borrowing a Sinhala phrase, ?eheth naha, meheth naha? (neither here nor there). Making matters worse is the fact that this government is handling the sins of the past. With a serious communications problem, and despite the statements made condemning the preceding regime, we convenient lay that aside and instead condemn this regime. Despite your feelings about the matter, there?s no denying that the ruckus over SAITM, and those development projects and their environmental impact, was born from Mahinda Rajapaksa?s government. But what do we have today? An outfit headed by Mahinda Rajapaksa eating into the government?s popularity (what little of it there is left, anyway) over its handling of the same problems traceable to the time he was in power! Can it get any more absurd than that? ?
So what?s the solution? First and foremost, to do away this culture of ambivalence that has gripped us for so long. It?s not only the government that has compelled this culture, moreover. It?s also us. The people. Popular culture. The many industries that operate on making money out of social problems. The intellectuals who are cut off from the same people they are supposed to help out in the first place. And of course those outfits which are hell-bent against the government. Given all that, we have a clear choice between us. Either we continue with the vague, indefinite, and non-committal way of looking at social ills, or we identify a problem for what it really is, minus our personal feelings, and get our representatives to solve them (or in the least try solving them for ourselves). Feel-good protest campaigns and vigils won?t do much. Positive, committed action will. It all depends on what we choose. And the drastic consequences which follow our choices, both now and to the future.

Aloysius refuses to provide passwords
	
The Commission of Inquiry today ordered Arjun Aloysius to provide his Apple user account name and password, it to the investigating officers and directed the staff to notice him as he had earlier refused to provide this information.
The Additional Solicitor General today told the Commission that the mobile phone which was given by Aloysius is the one he was using since October 2016. He said when the investigations had revealed about an apple account belonging to Mr. Aloysius, he was questioned about its user name and the password but he refused to divulge them.
Acceding to the ASG?s request the PCoI then decided to order him to provide the details as it was required for the digital forensic examination.
In the meantime, Counsel Chanaka de Silva who appeared for Central Bank's former Governor Arjun Mahendran, sought an order from the PCoI allowing his representative to be present when experts extract information from his client?s mobile device.
However, ASGs Dappula de Livera and Yasantha Kodagoda objecting to the submission told the commission that there was a well established practice by law in the process of case production and no one should be permitted to be present when experts extract details because it could jeopardize the forensic investigation.
They also drew the Commission?s attention into few higher court precedents and said there were international standards maintained in such instances, which could also be made available if the commission requires such information based on the situation.
The Commission directed the Attorney General?s Department to provide necessary details pertaining to the practice of productions so that they could make an appropriate order in relation to that later. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Calamities conjure concerns for child care
	
The stereotypical nature of the human mind may cause the term ?adoption? to pop into thought
	Concerned authorities call for ?Child care reforms? due to the presence of institutes not conducive to the healthy development of ?children
	Foster care is parenting given to a child by an adult who may or may not be related as a member of?the family.
Devastation struck Sri Lanka on December 26, 2004 leaving behind a morbid atmosphere in the country. That was the year of the tidal wave. The tsunami brought in waves of destruction, drowning the entire island in cries of grievances and tears of lamentations. Among those lost in the lamentations of the departure of loved ones and engulfed in a sense of destitution and despair were children. Many children were left displaced due to the untimely demise of their family members whose lives had been engulfed by the depths of the dark water catastrophe. ?
?2017 has been yet another year where the people have been facing a string of natural catastrophes where many lives were once again lost. The eruption of natural calamities in the country leaves us with restlessness, as a country smack in the middle of the Indian Ocean is very much prone to facing the fury of Mother Nature. We can be assured that this isn?t the last time that we will hear of such events. In the wake of disaster, the vulnerable victims to suffer emotionally are women and children. Children are especially at risk when disaster strikes as they face the probability of being displaced when the lives of their parents or caregivers are taken away. The past turn up of adverse natural phenomena this year has rung the alarming bells calling for the promotion of child care reforms. This is largely due to a proper care mechanism for children not being in operation in the country. This can be an inconvenience especially when a child displacement occurs during a natural disaster, something we have experienced in the bygone days this year. ?
SOS Children?s homes Sri Lanka (SOS CVSL), an organization ever engaged in endeavours carried out for the betterment of children throughout the island, yet again pursues another advocacy effort. This organization is calling to attention the appalling need in the promotion of care reforms to be exercised in the case of children displaced or orphaned in the country, especially at a time of natural calamity. SOS CVSL National Advisor for Advocacy Chathuri Jayasooriya, stressed that it?s during times of disaster that the importance of child care reforms are most highlighted and called for. ?Care reforms are a dire need for child welfare in the country as a whole. The recent natural disasters which have left many children displaced, call for them urgently,? stressed Jayasooriya.
The present mechanism of alternative care we find here isn?t child friendly, especially within the context of institutionalization. Secondary victimization within institutionalization is also not uncommon?
Basically, a child receives the care and protection of its parents or guardian. But in the instance that a child is deprived of its caregiver- be it a parent or a guardian-due to an unfortunate event, the child has to be placed in alternative care. There are various forms of alternative care that a child can be placed under. These forms vary according to the needs of the child. Section 35 of the Children and Young Persons Ordinance (CYPO) articulates two forms of alternative care for children deprived of their present caregivers and thereby deprived of care and protection. One alternative is the most resorted to residential care in a children?s home while the other is the placement of the child with a ?fit? person. A ?fit? person, as we call it, is referred to as one who provides foster care to a child who could either be a relative or non-relative willing to undertake care of the child. Foster care is parenting given to a child by an adult who may or may not be related as a member of the family. Although parental care is provided to the child in foster care, it?s only a temporary assumption of parental responsibility. However, the duration of the fostering period could range from a short period to as long as a number of years. Unlike in the case of adoption, permanent parental rights won?t be acquired by the caregivers under both methods of alternative care. These caregivers also won?t acquire the legal status of the child nor will the status of parents be altered. During the duration of placement, the parental responsibility of the child will be temporarily transferred to the manager of the children?s home or the ?fit? person. ??
According to Jayasooriya, the existing predominant form of alternative care in the country- which is the placement of children in children?s homes- has created a sense of institutionalization within its framework. This has provided an ill wind on the holistic development of the child, stunting it in the process. ?The present mechanism of alternative care we find here isn?t child friendly, especially within the context of institutionalization. Secondary victimization within institutionalization is also not uncommon. Although the UN guidelines discourage children under three years being institutionalized, this is rampant in our setting,?explained Jayasooriya.?
Exploring other methods of alternative care is essential to move away from institutionalization. Foster care has yet to be given serious consideration. The national advocacy advisor of SOS CVSL stated that while foster care provided to a child under a relative is practiced in the country, foster care by a non-relative isn?t much in effect in our social setting due to the obstacle of monitoring limitations. ?Despite legal provisions being made in the CYPO for the implementation of children being placed with fit persons-through the probationary care procedure- the actual implementation lacks muscle. Although the mechanism is presently used in kinship foster care, it?s virtually not exploited in the case of non-kinship care due to monitoring challenges,? she said. But Jayasooriya envisions foster care as a concept that could be encouraged, but must be properly monitored especially in the wake of natural catastrophes that displace many children by depriving them of their families and homes. She further stated that foster care has proven to be a successful form of alternative care in countries such like Georgia, Malawi and Moldova. ??
Avoiding institutionalization isn?t easy, but when horizons are broadened, practical possibilities do cross the mind. Group foster care is one such child friendly method. Its model is similar to that adopted by the SOS children?s villages. ?It enables children to enjoy the comfort of a family, though not necessarily a biological one,? said Jayasooriya further adding that the sense of kinship created within such a system with fellow ?siblings? has a positive psychological impact on children. ?
The stereotypical nature of the human mind may cause the term ?adoption? to pop into thought when the subject of alternative care is brought up. Adoption is considered another form of alternative care for children, but this option involves a permanent change in the legal state of the child and the parent. Adoption in certain scenarios also proves to be emotionally exhausting. ?This is a very lengthy judicial process which could cause psychological dilemma to both the child and the adoptive parents,?explained Jayasooriya.
No form of alternative care outshines the other and no form of alternative care is deemed better than the rest. Each option is withheld in its own ground of benefits and which alternative is decided most suitable depends on the circumstance and differs from child to child. What has to be ensured is that the sprouting of such institutions isn?t created within the framework of these child care alternatives, reinforced with systemic surveillance. ?It?s indeed a very ambitious move with a lot of dialogue and commitment required from the state and other relevant stakeholders especially in terms of determining what kind of care is required and following up, assuring the best interest of the child,? she said.?
National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) Chairperson Marini De Livera too elaborated on the urgency of care reforms and the withdrawal from institutionalization. She asserted that the NCPA receives several complaints regarding various forms of abuse and anomalies taking place in children?s homes almost every day. She further stated that it?s crucial to move away from institutionalization and to explore other care options for children who have lost family care. ?For the year 2017, nine complaints have been made to the NCPA with regard to abuse and anomalies in children homes. After taking up my position as chairperson of the NCPA, I visited the SOS villages in Sri Lanka and spent some time there. I was very impressed with the system of care that was being followed by SOS CVSL. The SOS concept is a far cry from most of the orphanages that are functioning in Sri Lanka which are sadly not conducive to the healthy development of the children who are living there. I fully endorse the need for child care reforms and this richly deserves unstinted support,?
De Livera said.?

Commercial Bank introduces Sri Lanka?s first ?Chip and PIN? debit card
	
Commercial Bank of Ceylon has introduced Mastercard debit cards with Chip and PIN technology for the first time in Sri Lanka.
These cards replace the existing Maestro debit cards with magnetic strips. The new Chip and PIN debit card will minimise the possibility of fraudulent transactions at Point-of-Sale (POS) due to the PIN requirement.
This technology renders the new Mastercard debit cards smart and significantly increases the security level of the card when transacting. Cardholders will receive their Personal Identification Numbers (PIN) via SMS to registered mobile numbers when branches issue the card. The bank said cardholders are advised to change these PINs to PINs of their choice at a Commercial Bank ATM before they perform a point-of-sale transaction or an ATM transaction. Cardholders simply enter their PINs at POS machines to authorise transactions.?
?Commercial Bank always believes in introducing technology that matters to customers. In this day and age, security is a primary concern of customers and this new card will ensure more secure purchases not only locally, but also when they are overseas,? Commercial Bank Deputy General Manager Marketing Hasrath Munasinghe said.
The Mastercard debit card with Chip and PIN technology is deemed risk averse since it requires the card holder to authenticate each EMV transaction using a PIN, or use an OTP (One Time Password) for e-commerce transactions. ?It does not support contactless transactions and cannot be used at e-commerce sites which do not support 3D secure technology, or at POS terminals which do not support PIN.
Commercial Bank said it will issue the new cards over the counter for cardholders who require an instant replacement.
Commercial Bank cards are the fastest growing cards in Sri Lanka and enjoy market leadership in Credit and Debit Card cumulative point-of-sale usage. The bank offers a variety of credit cards in the Silver, Gold and Platinum tiers of both Visa and MasterCard as well as Visa Signature, World MasterCard and Visa Infinite cards in the premium segment. The cards are equipped with ?Tap and Go? NFC technology and are backed by a strong NFC Point-of-Sale (POS) network. Commercial Bank ?Max Loyalty Rewards? scheme is the only loyalty scheme that offers loyalty rewards points on both Credit and Debit cards.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today announced that the government would sign the agreement on the US$1.1 billion Hambantota Port Project tomorrow.
Flanked by Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera and Central Bank Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy, the Premier told a news briefing held at its auditorium that the country had lost a staggering Rs.46 billion from the Port since 2011.
?Had we saved this amount, we could have provided medicine and medical treatment for 2.5 million Sri Lankans free of charge,? he said.
The Premier said members of the Opposition were given the opportunity to debate the port project agreement on Friday but they had not availed themselves of the opportunity because they had no grounds to oppose the agreement.
Addressing the concerns of the security related to the Port, he said its commercial, civil and naval activities would be managed as a joint venture but land and security matters would be handled by Sri Lanka.
Commenting on the Mattala Airport, the Premier expressed optimism that the government would be able to enter into an agreement by the end of this year.
?However, we have bad news with regard to the Sooriyawewa Cricket Stadium. There are no takers for this stadium. We will have to pay from our taxes for this project,? he said. (By Lahiru Pothmulla)

Husband fired unintentionally, says Jaffna killing suspect?s wife
	
My husband, Selavarasa Jayanthan (39) from Jaffna, was never a member of the LTTE. It is a rumour to say that he was a former combatant. My husband fired unintentionally, the wife of the main suspect said.
Two people were arrested in connections with the shooting incident targeting Jaffna High Court Judge, M. Elancheliyan at the Nallur South Road on July 22.
The main suspect surrendered on Tuesday morning and made his statement to the Police.
"After consuming liquor with some people in my house at Nallur on Saturday, we came to the Temple Road Junction on the Point Pedro Road. At that moment my cousin pointed at a Police Officer coming on a motorcycle and challenged me to shoot him, grabbing his pistol if I had the guts. Hearing this I grabbed the pistol at once from the Police Officer which went off accidentally," the suspect said.
Following that, brandishing the pistol, I once again stopped a scooter that was coming in that direction and taking it by force, I went through the Adiyapatham Road to Kalviyankadu area and from there I went to Ariyalai.
After abandoning the scooter behind the Peychchi Amman temple, I went to my maternal aunts' house in Thirunagar.
I told my aunt that I had hit a Police Officer in my drunken state and that the Police were searching for me. I changed my clothes there and went to the Kombayanmanal cemetery, where I spent the night.
I spent the following day at a relative's house in Navanthurai. That night, I went to my uncle's place at Koddady. My uncle who had come to know the incident at Nallur, advised me to surrender to the Police. So I went with my uncle, surrendered to the Police and made my statement,? he said.
The Police, after obtaining the statement from the suspect, took the suspect to his maternal aunt's house at Thirunagar in the Police vehicle with his face covered with a black cloth.
There the Police recovered the clothes worn by the suspect during the shooting.
The suspect was produced before the Jaffna Magistrate at his official residence on Tuesday. He was ordered to be remanded till August 8. (By M.Rosanth)

It is difficult to go back to pre-1972 system
	
It may be difficult to go back to system of governance based on pre-1972 era as the parties have committed themselves to maximum devolution of power unlike those days where the Government Agents represented the state at the village level, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
The Prime Minister made this remark at the Dudley Senanayake memorial lecture organized by Dudley Senanayake foundation together with Friedrich Naumann Shiftung Fur Di Freiheit at Temple Trees last evening.
?It is difficult to go back to pre-1972 system. One reason for this is there is a devolution of power today, and we are committing towards it to the maximum extent without changing the character of the state. Earlier the GAs carried out the work of the state. However today there is a Provincial Council system. One has to consider the relationship between the periphery and the Provincial Councils. How do we share the power between them? These are important issues. In a devolved government the first thing that needs to be considered is the relationship between the central executive and the provincial executive,? he said.
?One area under discussion currently is the executive presidency and on how to increase the power of Parliament, so that it could control the government. How to steer a state that is under the control of Parliament? There are some parties who want executive presidency be abolished while a few other want it retained. Meanwhile there are a few others who want to go back to a system based on Soulbury Constitution,? he added.
?Around the past ten years, we have seen the strengthening of the presidency. We saw it except the time when I was the Prime Minister under President Chandrika Kumaratunga. Since 2005, there was strengthening of presidency at the expense of Parliament. The House actually suffered. As a result, the country fell into a deep debt and the repayment has exceeded Rs. 4 trillion. We found a Chief Justice was removed without going through an impeachment process. There was no resolution to remove the CJ. We saw Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka was imprisoned. Then we thought we should do away with the Executive Presidency. That concept had brought many forces together and a Constitutional Assembly was subsequently formed. Before doing that, the 19th Amendment was brought in, and some powers of the executive presidency were removed. Six Sub Committees of the Constitutional Assembly have made their submissions. Upon that, an interim report will be presented to the Assembly, and after necessary debate, a final decision will be made,? he said.
Prominent figures, including Ministers Rauff Hakeem, D. M. Swamynathan, Ravi Karunanayake and State Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardene participated in the event. (Yohan Perera)

It was Victor who proposed first -Hashini
	
Victor Rathnayake is held in very high esteem among the people from all walks of life both as a renown musician and singer. People began to talk about him recently as there was a radical change in his private life. This change was caused by his second marriage. When brickbats being hurled at him by a certain section of the society, he faced them with patience. He selected a young lady named Hashini Amendra as his wife. She is 30 years his junior. Amendra was born and bred in the Southern Province. In order to see how this celebrity couple has progressed in the new innings, several journalists have met them at their home in Oruwala.
Victor and Hashini (H) hadn?t fancied giving much priority to talk about love and marriage when meeting these journalists. The following are excerpts of an interview done with them.
During my childhood, I liked Victor?s songs. My mother said that she gave his cassettes to console me when I cried
	I have made my maximum contribution to all his activities. I assist his musical activities.
	We spend married life happily. I am happy because I got a husband like this. I have no words to express such feelings
QWe wish to know about the love, care and intimacy associated with this new relationship.
An intimate relationship is created between two persons purely based on their mutual understanding. It?s a strong bond that depends on this mutual relationship between the two. I think this bond becomes strong due to the understating about love and care.
QWhen did you first feel about love? Is it during your school life?
Hashini: There was no such feeling during school life. It was after school that I felt so. I didn?t think of it. But, I have blurred memories of my first love. I don?t like to recall it because it was an immature love that took place during that time. I don?t like to talk about it at all.
?
?If we are blessed with a child, we will accept it as if would be given a state or country?
QIs this the reason why you entered married life quickly?
Yes, I first got married to that person.
QWhy did you desert him? Is it due to not receiving the love you expected from him or is there some other reason?
I don?t like to talk about it at all because these memories are buried with the sands of time. I have forgotten those poignant memories and don?t wish to talk about that marriage.
QHow did you develop a love towards Victor Rathnayaka?
We have associated with each other for a long time. Later, we got married. I had an intimate relationship with Victor for about 8-9 years and it started when we met at a musical show. That relationship developed into love with the passage of time.
QA mere relationship won?t turn in to love, does it? How did the feelings about love and care develop?
During my childhood, I liked Victor?s songs. My mother said that she gave his cassettes to console me when I cried. They had helped me to stop crying. When I went to school I took his cassettes along with me. Due to this strong bond, it gradually became love. This background of him helped us identify each other.
QYou said that you had a desire to see him earlier. Then, why didn?t you go to see him earlier?
No. I have seen his ?Sa? musical shows on numerous occasions. But, I didn?t go and speak to him because I was afraid those days because I was a schoolgirl. He was a colossus. However, at a certain musical show, I got the opportunity to talk to him. It was only after that this love developed.
As Victor was listening to all what was said, this scribe didn?t forget to talk to him as well.
QWho expressed love first?
It was Victor who expressed love first. But, it was a platonic relationship. Victor expressed his love through words.
QWhat did you feel that day?
I was overjoyed and felt as if I won the whole world. We exchanged gifts and sentimental items. That maybe because our relationship was intimate.
QWhen you revealed this friendship to family members how did?they respond?
They had no reason to respond because we carried on our love affair on the sly for a long time. However, when, they came to know about this they devised various ways and means with the help of friends to stop it. Various proposals were brought to me and many things were done to stop our affair. But, we didn?t change our stance.
QBoth of you continued this affair for a long time. What made you marry suddenly?
It was after a long time, that we decided to marry. Our affair was strong. We were firmly established on the condition that there should be a single concept in marriage. But, we decided to marry when unnecessary remarks were directed at us from the relatives and the society at large. We married at our own will and until such time, we were ?living together?.
QAfter marriage what is your opinion about life? Do you still have that love and care in this relationship.
Our love affair began long ago. We lived as if we were married even before marriage. The only difference is that it was later that we signed as husband and wife. There is no change in our previous love. It exists without a change.
QVictor is your husband. Your former lover has become your husband. Do you now look at your husband through the eyes of a wife ?
Earlier we loved as immature lovers. This type of things are being done by everybody. It?s not like that now. We are firmly connected to each other. The Victor I saw earlier is the same today. The only change is that the then lover has become my husband now. It?s very easy to live with him. He is open in his ideas and understands things quickly.
QAre you carrying on with married life happily?
Yes. Really. I see no big difference today because we have spent life like this for a long time.
QIsn?t there any problem from your side of the family?
No. all such problems have been solved. They were opposed to us during the first several weeks of our marriage. They have understood now and they have allowed us to live on our own.
QHow do you contribute to Victor?s artistic activities?
I have made my maximum contribution to all his activities. I have studied eastern music. I assist his musical activities. I help him deal with quotations. I have freed Victor from doing house work like doing the shopping etc. I do it myself. I have given him full freedom to engage in his artistic activities.
QWhen you go to public places what type of response do you get?
They have a very high regard for me as the wife of Victor Rathnayake. Many people come and ask, ?Are you Victor Rathnayake?s wife??
QThe age difference between both of you is more than 30 years. Didn?t it stand in the way of your marriage?
Not at all. When you ask such a question, it reminds me that there is such a large age difference. But, it pales into insignificance when we live together. Even in those days, I didn?t think of the age difference. I think that I am living with a person who is not more than three years elder to me. He has made me understand that there is no problem regarding this age gap. We have no such problem at all because ?Victor is like a youngster now. I feel I am with a young person when Victor and I deal with love, care and sexual matters.
QHave you decided to give birth to a baby? You have already said so. Is the background prepared for such a thing?
I haven?t related that story. My comments might have been misinterpreted and published in a newspaper. I could have resorted to legal action on the grounds that they have cooked up such a story. After marriage, isn?t it the baby that a woman expects? In such a case, I told that I accept motherhood with pleasure. That is all I said.
QWhat I ask is do both of you have such an idea?
Both of us accept it happily. We are in a very happy mood. If we are blessed with a child, we will accept it as if would be given a state or country. Let time be the decider.
QWhen you had an affair with Victor, didn?t you get any undue proposal from others?
There were no such things. But, I experienced situations that unmarried women face when living in society. After marriage, I didn?t encounter these problems. Now, I am treated as his wife. Now there are little or no requests like that now.
QWhat about married life? What do you think of love, care and sexuality?
We spend married life happily. I am happy because I got a husband like this. I have no words to express such feelings. At times, he is a friend, father, brother and a teacher who teaches me. I think that I may be the luckiest wife in this world. It is such a miracle.
QDo you think that this bondage has come from a previous birth?
Yes. Somebody has expressed the same sentiments to to Victor before. I don?t know whether these statements are made using astrology. An astrologer had told him that he has got as his present wife the wife from his previous birth. Our bondage is strong like that.
As Victor was listening to all what was said, this scribe didn?t forget to talk to him as well.
QWhat do you think of your new wife?
I think the word ?wife? is suitable for Hashini in the real sense of the word. I say this because she understands me well. She has studied western music not eastern music. Therefore, I ?have a relief working in this field. She can prepare the notations and other things related to music. That is the assistance that I get from her. The assistance that a creator can get ?from his wife is immense. That is very important. ?I think Hashini may have carried with her such a ?hope from a previous birth.
?QWhat do you think of married life now?
There is nothing special. We live under one roof. But there is not much difference about married ?life and living together. ?But after signing as husband and wife we now have the power to live as a family and go anywhere. Marriage gives you the assurance that a relationship is stable. However, ?the way the society may look at us could be different.
QThat means you are familiar with the concept of living together. What do you think of it?
Living together is one thing. Married life is another. Living together can?t be continued everyday. We should be mature, isn?t it? This should be not ?in terms of age, but in terms ?of ideas and attitudes. We can?t continue living everyday sharing handkerchiefs, exchanging gifts, toffees and ?chocolates. We wanted to marry because the present society can have a different perspective with this regard.
Their comments convinced this writer that they have understood what life is. Victor didn?t like to talk about his first marriage and the children who belong to it. There was a time when this couple had to visit the police station and even produce their marriage certificate. Now these issues have subsided and they live happily. I wished ?them a happy married life. ??

## Title: Pakistan Premier Nawaz Sharif removed
## Section: Breaking News

Pakistan Premier Nawaz Sharif removed
	
Pakistan?s Supreme Court on Friday ordered the removal of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif from office over accusations of corruption, delivering a historic ruling that is likely to shift the country?s tumultuous political balance and deal a serious blow to the legacy of a man who helped define the past generation of Pakistani politics.
The removal of Mr. Sharif, who was serving his third term in office, comes roughly a year before his term was to end.
The verdict means the governing political party, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, must choose an interim prime minister to replace Mr. Sharif until the next general election, which is scheduled for mid-2018.
Announced by the five-member Supreme Court, the verdict caps more than a year of high political drama, breathless court proceedings and a piercing investigation into the finances of the Sharif family.
Watching the courtroom drama was the country?s powerful military, which has traditionally decided the fate of civilian governments. There had been hushed speculation that the court, in coming to its decision, had the tacit, if not overt, backing of powerful generals.
The charges against Mr. Sharif and three of his children ? two sons and a daughter ? stemmed from disclosures last year in the Panama Papers, which revealed that the children owned expensive residential property in London through a string of offshore companies. In their ruling on Friday, the justices also ordered the opening of criminal investigations against the Sharif family.
Imran Khan, the opposition politician who has been spearheading the campaign against Mr. Sharif since he took power in 2013, stands to gain the most politically from the removal of Mr. Sharif. Mr. Khan has doggedly and almost obsessively led the charge against Mr. Sharif and rallied a wide swath of the public against him through a mix of street agitation and court petitions.
The Supreme Court had asked the members of the Sharif family to provide a paper trail of the money they used to buy their London apartments. Investigators found that they were ?living beyond their means.?
Despite repeated court exhortations, Mr. Sharif?s family and its lawyers failed to provide satisfactory documentation, the justices said. Several of the documents they produced were declared fake or insufficient.
Mr. Sharif has called the inquiry into his family?s finances a conspiracy and has asserted that in his three terms as prime minister he has not been tarred by a major corruption scandal. He repeatedly rebuffed calls to resign and said that he had done no wrong.
The ruling, while expected, leaves unanswered the long-term fate of the man who has been a dominating force in Pakistani politics for the better part of three decades.
?I did not expect Nawaz Sharif to go scot-free,? said Hasan Askari Rizvi, a prominent political analyst who is based in Lahore.
?If he has a long-term vision, he will sit back and guide his political party,? Mr. Rizvi added. ?He and his supporters will portray the court verdict as victimization and a grave conspiracy involving international powers.?
Mr. Sharif?s removal from office throws his political succession plans into disarray. His daughter Maryam Nawaz Sharif, who was being groomed as his political heir, was also implicated in the case.
Political insiders say there are several possible contenders to replace Mr. Sharif: Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, the speaker of the national assembly; Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, the minister of petroleum; Khurram Dastgir Khan, the commerce minister; and Khawaja Muhammad Asif, the defense minister.
?Whoever they bring will be a weak prime minister, as Nawaz Sharif would want to have someone who is more or less in line with his thinking,? Mr. Rizvi said.
Mr. Khan?s supporters had laid siege to the Parliament and other government buildings in 2014 after accusing Mr. Sharif of rigging the 2013 general elections. Another attempt to blockade the capital in 2016 was unsuccessful, but it forced the Supreme Court justices to take up the Panama Papers case.
After the Supreme Court reserved judgment on the case on July 21, Mr. Khan on Wednesday urged the court to announce a verdict without delay.
?The whole country is at a standstill due to the Panama Papers case,? Mr. Khan said. Critics said Mr. Khan was pressuring the courts.
Political analysts say the court verdict hands Mr. Khan an undeniable political and moral victory.
?Imran Khan will be strengthened, but it remains to be seen how he capitalizes in Punjab Province, which is critical to winning the general elections,? Mr. Rizvi said. Punjab, the most populous and prosperous of the country?s four provinces, has remained a stronghold of Mr. Sharif for decades.
Mr. Sharif presided over a period of relative economic stability and was able to complete a few large infrastructure projects while reducing the crippling power outages that have long afflicted Pakistan.
But the stubborn scandal over the London real estate holdings sullied the reputation of the family.
Mr. Sharif?s political party nonetheless hopes that his achievements can bring it another electoral success next year even if Mr. Sharif cannot run for office. Mr. Sharif is expected to campaign for his party.
During his current tenure, Mr. Sharif had an uneven relationship with the powerful military. His overtures of more openness toward India, Pakistan?s longtime foe, backfired as generals spurned his efforts.
More recently, relations with the military took a darker turn after news reports detailed how civilian officials confronted the military over what they called a failure to act against Islamist groups. Mr. Sharif had to fire his information minister and two top aides to placate the army.
Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the chairman of the Pakistan Peoples Party, said the Panama Papers ruling was ?a real test of our system.?
Some predicted a politically volatile time ahead.
?Until the elections, this will lead to a period of political instability,? Amber Rahim Shamsi, a prominent journalist who hosts a show on Dawn TV, said of the verdict.
?The Sharif political dynasty has somehow managed to survive Pakistan?s rough and bloody politics for over three and a half decades through wheeling and dealing,? Ms. Shamsi said. ?It is hard to imagine all the family falling like a pack of cards. Nawaz Sharif has a following and could cash in on political martyrdom to stage a comeback.? (nytimes)

Pakistani girl raped in ?revenge? for a rape her brother committed
	
?
?(c) 2017, The Washington Post ? Samantha Schmidt ? Jul 27, 2017 - ? The extended family members all lived within yards of each other, in a small village in Pakistan?s Punjab.A daughter of the family, around the age of 12 or 13, was cutting the grass in nearby fields on July 16 when a teenage boy covered her with a cloth and raped her. The boy was a 16-year-old relative of hers. ??
The family?s elders gathered in shock and anguish, seeking to resolve what had happened. ?
But mourning soon led to vengeance. The elders - who effectively served as the village council - decided that justice should be served as revenge. They instructed the victim?s brother, who is about 16, to rape the teenage sister of the attacker in return for his crime, Ahsan Younis, head of the Multan city police, told The Washington Post. ? ??

PC poll postponement: PAFFREL, CaFFE express concern
	
A number of local election watchdogs yesterday raised concerns over the Cabinet decision to introduce amendments to the Provincial Councils Election Act no. 2 of 1998 enabling elections to all PCs to be conducted on a single day citing the holding of PC polls on a scattered basis was a waste of state funds and the negative effect it had on democracy.
PAFFREL Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi said if the government intended to conduct elections to all 9 provinces, the government must disclose the time frame it expects to hold polls to all provinces whether it would be after September / October of 2017 or after October 2018, after April 2019 or October 2019?.
Mr. Hettiarachchi said he was worried as it was possible to postpone the Parliamentary polls also if the PC polls were postponed despite the fact that the Supreme Court has ruled twice that the right of franchise of the people cannot be postponed.
While demanding the government not to deprive the right to vote of the people, Mr. Hettiarachchi further says that suspicion was building up among the people that the government?s decision to conduct PC polls on a single day may be a ruse to postpone all future elections.
If the government has a non political and genuine desire to save government funds and democracy the best thing to do was to discuss the matter with all provincial councils and dissolve PCs with a longer term of office and conduct the PC polls on a single day, Mr. Hettiarachchi stressed.
Meanwhile, the Campaign for Free & Fair Election (CaFFE) said the Cabinet had no legal authority to postpone the elections for the Provincial Councils.
CaFFE Executive Director Keerthi Tennakoon reiterated the election could only be postponed if the government received people?s consent at a referendum.
?Not even a two third majority of Parliament could postpone the PC election. The SLFP has a history of postponing elections unlike the UNP. However, both parties are in unison postponing elections today. Not even the opposition parties including the joint opposition keen on calling for polls,? he said.
Mr. Tennakoon said civil society organisations (CSO) also continue to keep mum over government?s anti-democratic actions in the name of ?good governance.?
The term of office of 9 provinces is scheduled to expire in four stages and they are Sabaragamuwa, Eastern and North-Central in September/October period, Central, Wayamba and Northern in October 2018, Central, Southern and Western in April 2019 and Uva in October 2019.

Police warn women motorists of trishaw con men
	
Narahenpita Police have unearthed a con of two siblings who drive trishaws that threaten and demand money from female motorists as compensation, saying that the latter had accidentally hit and damaged their taxis.
A con of ripping off money from especially female motorists of well-to-do background was reported recently in Cinnamon Gardens, where two siblings who were highly addicted to drugs had demanded money for their damages.
One of the victims, a woman who had faced the con told the Daily Mirror that her vehicle was being motioned to stop by a trishaw that came from behind (bearing the registration number GR-2656) by flashing its headlights near the Kassapa Road in Jawatte few weeks back.
The driver in the trishaw had then approached her and asked for money as compensation saying that her car had hit his vehicle and broke the side mirror.
However, the woman who was felt suspicious about this claim had denied the trishaw driver?s claim of her car hitting his side mirror. She had however asked the trishaw driver to visit her house to further discuss the matter but the suspicious character had then fled the scene.
?It was happened about three weeks ago. After I pulled over the vehicle following the light signal the pursuing trishaw driver had approached me and knocked on my shutter. Then he claimed that my vehicle had bumped into his vehicle and broke his mirror.
But I was pretty sure that I did not do so and asked him to follow my car to my residence which was in the close proximity. In the meantime I telephoned and explained my family driver of what had happened. Seeing my driver coming out of my residence the trishaw driver had quickly left place,? she said.
Making her doubts a reality, the same character had once again bumped into her committing the same racket near the Independence Square on Thursday (27), not even recognizing that it was she who he once tried to deceive.
The woman who was smart enough to realize that it was a con targeting women motorists had taken photographs of the trishaw and of the driver?s license had later lodged a complaint with the Narahenpita Police.
?He was young, looked extremely drugged out and drove recklessly. I instantly recognized that it was the same person who attempted to deceive me once before and was fortunate enough to realize that it was a con. So I complained to the police to prevent such losers prey on innocent women? she further said.
When contacted, a Narahenpita Police officer told the Daily Mirror that the police is already aware of the con and have identified the suspects behind this operation.
He said the suspect had recently been released on bail for committing the same kind of crime and his brother is still behind bars for the same offence. They both had four similar complaints against them.
?They are two brothers from Piliyandala and Pepiliyana areas that had carried out this racket in Colombo. Four incidents had been reported against them but there could be more cases as these people had especially targeted women. Both the suspects are addicted to excessive use of Heroin and Ganja,? the officer said.
He further said, in the latest incident the suspect has come from a different trishaw and the police had already informed the Department of Motor Traffic of its registration number to trace the vehicle and the suspect. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

PSO not legally approved: JO
	
The joint opposition said today the Public Security Ordinance (PSO) was not legally approved in Parliament according to Standing Orders and parliamentary tradition even though the government claimed it was properly approved.
JO MP Dinesh Gunawardane said according to the Constitution and SOs, the mace should be in the house to approve an Act of Parliament but it was not so when the public security ordinance was approved yesterday.
"The Constitution clearly mentions that parliament should act according to Standing Orders. Instead what happened yesterday was a violation of SOs," he said.
The MP said the government called for a vote after the debate on declaring fuel distribution and supply an essential service without allocating time for a reply.
He claimed that those involved in attacking trade union leaders during the petroleum strike had not been arrested so far.
Former speaker Chamal Rajapaksa said the government was trying to suppress the opinion of the opposition and pointed out that the income from the Hambantota port had reduced during the past two years when compared with 2014.
"We cannot accept the government's claim that the port had been leased because of loans and losses," he said. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

The Rs.145 million used in making the initial payment of Rs.16.5 million and thereafter to pay the monthly loan installment of Rs.11 million for the controversial purchase of the Monarch Residency Penthouse in Colombo by a company owned by Minister Ravi Karunanayake's family, has no origin nor has it been accounted for according to what was revealed at the PCoI today.
Testifying at the inquiry, Chief Financial Officer of the Global Transportation and Logistics Pvt Ltd (GTLPL), Mr B.R. Chinnaiya explained the manner in which the Monarch Residencies Penthouse had been purchased.
The witness, who has 36 years of experience in the banking field had been also appointed to the Board of Directors of the BOC in 2015 by the then Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake for a period of one year.
* ASG Yasantha Kodagoda hints at money laundering
* Rs.145 million unaccounted money in GTLPL Chairman Lakshmi Kanthan?s safe
* GTLPL Chief Financial officer B.R. Chinnaiya makes startling revelation at inquiry
It was earlier revealed that Minister Karunanayake and his family occupied a Penthouse at the Monarch Residencies for eight months on a lease basis and the monthly lease rental of Rs.1.45 million was paid by Arjun Aloysius.
Subsequently the penthouse had been purchased for Rs.165 million by GTLPL, in which Minister Karunanayake?s wife Mela and daughter Onella were directors.
According to the witness, the GTLPL has two major share holders, 30% acquired by a foreign company headed by the GTLPL Chairman and 70% owned by a company known as OSM Holdings, in which Ms. Karunanayake and their daughter Onella are directors.
The witness said he was instructed by these two directors to obtain a loan and purchase the Penthouse in July 2016 for the use of the Chairman and the family or to be uses when foreign guests are required to be accommodated.
The witness said he then negotiated with the Seylan Bank for the loan but had no negotiations with the price at which the GTLPL would buy the apartment.
It was told that there was an advance payment of Rs.16.5 million had to be paid to the owner of the Penthouse.
However, it was revealed during the evidence that the GTLPL did not have that much money in there account at the time.
He said directors Ms Karunanayake and daughter Onella, instructed him to get the Rs.16.5 million from the Chairman?s safe at the company and pay the initial payment as they had obtained his permission to do so. Mr. Chinnaiya said there was Rs.25 million in the Chairman?s safe.
Later, a loan of Rs.150 million had been granted by the bank on a mortgage to buy the Penthouse.
It was also revealed that the witness had told the bank that the Company wished to buy the Penthouse to rent it out and the rental payment would be directly allocated into the repayment, though it never happened.
The GTLPL agreed with the bank to repay the loan in 15 installments of Rs.11 million each.
The witness said nine installments had been paid so far using the liquid cash available at the Chairman?s safe at the GTLPL.
In a shocking revelation, when he was questioned about the origin of the money, the witness said Chairman ?Lakshmi Kanthan? who resides in Britain had arrived at the Company on two occasions in February 2016 and 2017 and dumped cash amounting to Rs.145 million in the Chairman's safe.
The witness said that the Chairman had handed him Rs.70 million to be kept in the safe in February 2016 and later another Rs.75 million had been given in February 2017.
It was revealed that the witness had accepted the cash on the two occasions and it had not been supported by any documentation or receipt issued to Mr. Kanthan neither were there any entries in the GTLPL accounts books regarding these two cash inflows.
It seemed that the Commission and the Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda who led the evidence were shocked with the comment of the witness and continued to question him about the origin of the money.
The witness said he never questioned his Chairman Kanthan over how the money was generated.
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena and Justice KT Chithrasiri asked the witness on what basis, being a prudent banker himself, had accepted the money by not verifying its origin. And the Commission also questioned the possibility of the practice that such a large amount of money being kept in a safe without allocating it to the business.
ASG Kodagoda was also of the view that there could be criminal aspects, such as money laundering, deriving through such practices.
On being questioned by the ASG, the witness said the Chairman's safe was of medium size and that he had brought the money in two parcels to be placed in the safe.
Adding some amusement to the query, ASG Kodagoda commented, ?the chairman?s safe is like a Perpetual Treasure Box?.
Refering to the statement of accounts presented by the witness of the GTLPL, Justice Jayawardena also questioned the witness relating to the Rs.145 million given by the chairman. The witness was unable to find such an entry in the company's statement of accounts.
The ASG finally explained to the commission that the initial payment of Rs.16.5 million and the installment of Rs.11 million for nine months had been paid from the money (Rs.145 million) placed in the chairman?s safe by Mr. Kanthan himself, while the origin of that money was not reflected in any documentation.

SC awards Rs. 500,000 to expat Tamils
	
The Supreme Court yesterday ordered the officers of Terrorists Investigation Department (TID) to hand over the premises they are occupying in Wellawatte to the owners within 8 weeks.
Court delivered its judgment on the fundamental rights petition of two expatriate Sri Lankans who are residents of Switzerland complaining of the alleged unlawful occupation of their own premises at Wellawatte by officers of the Terrorists Investigation Department.
Justice B.P.Aluvihara with Chief Justice Priyasath Dep and Justice Anil Gooneratne agreeing in his judgment held that the petitioners? fundametal right to equality has been violated by the TID and awarded Rs 500,000 to the petitioners as compensation.
The court also ordered for the payment to the Petitioners as costs.
The Court declared that the amended Emergency Regulations was ultra vires and null and void.
Petitioners Shanmugam Sivarajah Nagarajah and Sivarajah Sarojini Devi cited OIC of the TID, its Director, DIG of the TID, Inspector Abdeen and Subair of the TID, IGP, Secretary and Additional Secretary to the Defence Ministry, Lalith Weeratunge who was the Secretary to the former President and the Attorney General as Respondents.
Valarmathy Sundaralingam, who is the Power of Attorney Holder for the Petitioners Shanmugam Sivarajah and Sivarajah Sarojini Devi filed a Counter Affidavit on behalf of the Petitioners.
She stated one Sivapragasam Vijayanesan who was the cousin of the 2nd Petitioner Sarojini Devi facilitated the purchase on behalf of the Petitioner and initially was in occupation of the said premises.
The Petitioner Sivarajah left the country as a refugee due to the conditions that prevailed in the country.
Valarmathy in her affidavit stated the said Vijayanesan was entrusted with the said property on trust and he acted on the petitioners? behalf on entering in to agreements with person for the lease of the house informally namely to the Centre for Health. Later she said Vijayanesan had migrated to Australia in 2008.
She pointed out it is mysterious as to how the 1st Respondent OIC and his officers would conclude that the said property had been used to commit offences and/or illegal activities and then take action to release the employees who were arrested from the said Centre who would have been part of the said illegal activities.
The female officers of the TID commenced occupying the said premises on July 26, 2009 and the purported order made by the Defence Minister was made in December 2009 and the same had been communicated to the IGP only on December 28 of 2009, she pointed out. The OIC of the TID failed to explain the manner in which the said female officers were authorized to lodge in the said premises and if it was done under authority, there would have been some form of documentation authorizing them to occupy, she alleged.
She stated she lived in the said premises with her elderly relative and his younger daughter. Although the 1st floor is occupied by female police officers, occasionally men visited the premises even at night and whereby they were compelled to keep the gates of the said premises opened even at night.
Both parties had earlier informed Court that they were attempting to settle the matter and the Court granted time for settlement.
The Court had granted leave to proceed with this rights petition for the alleged infringement of their fundamental right to equality.
Saliya Peiris instructed by Gowry Shangary Thavarasha appeared for the Petitioners. (?S.S.Selvanayagam)

Thajudeen case:  CID to trace 'mystery man' behind
	
The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) yesterday informed the Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court that it was in the process of identifying the individual in the vehicle which had followed Wasim Thajudeen?s vehicle at the time of the incident.
When Additional Magistrate Jeyaram Trotsky enquired into the progress of the investigation, Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) Dilan Ratnayake informed court that CID is in the process of tracking the phone calls made by the victim before his death.
Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) also informed court that they had concluded the investigation on former Chief Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) Prof. Ananda Samarasekara and that the report had been submitted to court last month. The SLMC stated that it had found the former Chief JMO guilty of three of the five charges filed against him.
The SLMC further said that it had concluded investigations on two other JMOs, Shiyantha Amararatne and C. K. Rajaguru on two charges related to the missing body parts of the slain former Havelocks ruggerite and found both were not guilty.
Meanwhile, the DSG said the SLMC and the CID were collaborating on investigations related to the former Chief JMO and would report to the court if there were grounds to arrest Prof. Samarasekara.
On September 21, 2016, the CID informed court that several body parts of Wasim Thajudeen were missing and were allegedly removed from the mortuary coolers at the Colombo JMO office to 'SAITM' in Malabe.
The CID also sought to extend the period allowed to continue investigations. The Additional Magistrate fixed the case for August 24 for the next hearing. (Yoshitha Perera)

Top Sino-Indian diplomats meet amid Doklam standoff
	
?
Beijing, (Hindustan Times), 27 July 2017 - ? India?s National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval and top Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi discussed ?major problems? in bilateral relations during a meeting in Beijing on Thursday, the first substantial contact since the two sides became engaged in a military standoff in Doklam (Donglang) area near the Sikkim border in mid-June. ??
Details of their discussions were not immediately available but a brief readout from the Chinese side said Yang brought up ?bilateral issues? and ?major problems? during the meeting. ? Doval is in Beijing to attend a two-day BRICS security summit but the focus has been on his bilateral interactions with the Chinese leadership against the backdrop of the standoff and intense speculation on whether the two sides would begin a conversation to ease tensions, if not resolve the impasse.Earlier, there was a question mark on whether Doval and Yang would have a one-on-one meeting given that China had set the withdrawal of Indian troops from Donglang as a precondition for a ?meaningful dialogue? on the standoff. ? ?

Undergrads produce eco-friendly battery
	
Targets poor people to help them survive the ?solar power war?
Graphite electrodes
A research team of the North western university has made an eco-friendly low cost battery with special capacitors using local graphite and jelly polymer electric dissection in an attempt to boost inventions made using solar energy. ?
Assembling a cell
This team has used local graphite for the negative polarity and magnesium or zinc metals for the positive polarity. Jelly polymer electric dissections have been used in the batteries. The scientists claimed that they have successfully experimented with it at the laboratory level using graphite and jelly polymer electric dissections for special capacitors.
Gel polymer electrolyte
The scientists claimed that they have successfully experimented with it at the laboratory level
?This research is being done by the contributions of the post graduate students W.A.D.S.Weerasinghe and Wathsala Prasadini under the leadership of Professor Kamal Widanapathirana and Professor Kumudu Perera (Ms) of the Electronic Department attached to Applied Science Faculty of the North Western University. In this connection, financial benefits have been provided by the National Research Council, National Science Foundation and the North Western University.
Supercapacitor with graphite electrodes?
Especially, the stored electricity is essential for the nighttime. The cost of appliances and special capacitors available at present for storing electricity is very high
This is how prof. Kamal Widanapathirana expressed his views regarding the research: ?We have decided to manufacture these batteries and special capacitors targeting various electronic applications including solar panel providing programmes for one million houses in the solar power ?war? that is being implemented at present by the government. The main problem in the manufacture of solar power at present is its inability to store it as a profit. Especially, the stored electricity is essential for the nighttime. The cost of appliances and special capacitors available at present for storing electricity is very high. The solar power ?war? is specially directed at the rural poor. Therefore, it?s essential to make a battery or a special capacitor at an affordable price. We hope to use jelly polymer electric dissections that had been made earlier under several other projects. The reason for this is the problematic situation in the electric dissections of many batteries and special capacitors throughout the world,? ?
Prof K. P. Vidanapathirana

He further said that the main reason for the use of metals such as magnesium and zinc for batteries is the insecurity in the lithium. He added that there are problems in the application as well as discarding of lithium. According to him, their aim is to minimize the cost of accessories and give a value to the resources of the country. This they hope to do by using graphite for batteries and special capacitors. It is worth mentioning that they have achieved great success at tests done at the laboratory level at present. He said confidently that his team hopes to finish the project within a period of two years and that it would become a successful product in the years to come. ?
Prof K. S. Perera?
He lived life his way
In memory of Bernard Shanmuganathan
Bernard Shanmuganathan was a larger than life personality. ?We lost this great friend a couple of days back. It?s simply impossible to come to terms with this loss. The knots in the stomach for once, seem to be getting worse by the day. A sense of emptiness prevails. ?
Way back in the early 70?s, as kids, we met at the hostel of St. Anthony?s College Katugastota. We were in the boarding; ?the breeding ground for lasting friendship. Our friendship lasted for four and a half decades. The SACK 1980 batch, as we were known, was quite a popular batch in college circles. Bernard was the most popular in this circle. He was instrumental in keeping the batch together throughout with his colourful and cheerful way of life. We were like brothers and were glued together like one family.?
Dear Bernard, for you, life was a journey that was to be lived your way, in a literary sense. You were concerned about others more than of yourself. You took efforts to make everyone around you more comfortable than you were. You were a conduit behind every acquaintance, gathering or event. You were able to bring forth joy and happiness to all around you.?
Cricket your sporting passion. We remember the great feats as a wicket keeper- batsman. Your contemporary cricketers would have many?stories to relate.?
You worked very hard from scratch to build a very successful business. This business is a tribute to your focus and attention on anything that you embarked on. You built a network of friends and acquaintances that went beyond an ordinary personality.?
We recall how you loved music and sang better than anyone else to keep a session going. Not only were you present at any event, but you made sure it was memorable. You were always there when someone needed a friend. You loved people. The memories that we cherish of you will never fade away. They are firmly etched in our minds. ?
You said goodbye to your wife Shanthi and two daughters Shalini and Sharon. Their world might never be the same without you.?
Goodbye my friend. We bid goodbye to a great soul whom we can proudly call a true friend.?
May your soul rest in peace. ?

The markings which add strength to the Mount of Sun singly and in combinations are Star, Triangle, Square, Trident, and the Single Vertical Line. The Grille, Cross, Island, Dot or Spot, or Cross bars signify defects either in health or in character.
The markings on the Mount of Sun and what they signify are given below.
?
One deep straight line - Wealth or fame or both
	Two lines - Real talent, but poor success Two conflicting talents except when one of the lines is clearly a sister Line of the Line of Sun
	Many lines: - Artistic tendencies and scientific propensities. Inspiration dissipated before realization
	A spot or a dot - danger of losing reputation
	A cross with a good Line of Sun ? Success If the Line of Sun is weak - Religious insanity
	A star with a good Line of Sun - Great fame and wealth due to genius
	A star without a good Line of Sun- Fame after many obstacles and wealth coming too late - Not a good character
	A square on the Mount - Good financial success
	An ill-formed circle at the base of the finger with a poor Line of Sun- Eye sight in danger
	A circle - Much fame and foreign travel several times
	A grille: - Insane vanity
	A triangle - High honours in the field of arts
Health peculiarities of solar subjects or those with a well-developed Mount of Sun: Solar?
subjects generally enjoy good health. Their?
optimistic and positive attitude towards life, contributes to their good health. Their weak point is eye sight. Often their heart is also found in a poor condition.
