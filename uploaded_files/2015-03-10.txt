Don?t look at SL through Tamil prism
	
	India should see Sri Lanka as a whole and stop focussing just on the island?s Tamil-majority Northern Province, Sri Lankan Cabinet Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said in an interview to The Hindu on Monday.
	The Power and Energy Minister said Prime Minister Narendra Modi?s pragmatic approach to Sri Lanka could enhance trade, technological and political partnerships, paving the way for a ?win-win situation? for the neighbouring countries.
	?That India is a guarantor of the northern Tamil people?s rights should now be a thing of the past,? he said in an apparent reference to India?s push for devolution of powers in Sri Lanka as per the 13th Amendment, consequent to the Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987.
	?The Sri Lankan Tamils have to cooperate with the existing government to settle their problems without dragging India in,? said the Minister, a prominent politician in the Sinhala-nationalist Jathika Hela Urumaya (National Heritage Party), led largely by Buddhist monks. The party was a key member in former President Mahinda Rajapakasa?s coalition, before members crossed over to the joint opposition platform ahead of Sri Lanka?s January 8 presidential polls, backing President Maithripala Sirisena.
	Observing that India?s perspective on Sri Lanka needed to change, he said: ?It [Sri Lanka] is not part of India or Indian culture, we have created a unique, organic culture here.? India?s ?support? to the LTTE had caused a ?big disappointment? in the psyche of the Sinhalese people, but India could change that by engaging through music, cinema, fashion and cricket. ?There are various common things other than Hinduism and Buddhism.?
	Commenting on major infrastructure projects funded by foreign nations, Mr. Ranawaka said Sri Lanka ought to have had technical audits before clearing them, pointing to Sri Lanka?s Northern railway line project that was restored with Indian assistance. ?The line constructed by India was four times more than the benchmark costs,? he said, adding that similar infrastructure projects funded by China should have also been subjected to greater scrutiny.
	On Sri Lanka?s perceived tilt towards China, the Minister said the ?mistrust? under the Rajapaksa government could now be buried and India and Sri Lanka now had a good opportunity to engage as equal partners. ?We all have to accept that China is going to be the next economic super power. India cannot tell Sri Lanka what its China policy should be. Unfortunately Sri Lanka was a bit trapped between the undeclared cold war between US and China.?
	Even as he emphasised the need for Sri Lanka to adopt a policy of non-alignment, Minister Ranawaka clarified: ?We all have to accept one thing. China is going to be the next economic super power,? adding: ?India cannot tell Sri Lanka what its China policy should be.?
	On the ongoing power plant project in the island?s Eastern Province ? India?s NTPC is a partner in the joint venture set up for building the coal-powered plant ? the Minister said the Environment Impact Assessment report was ready and was currently being presented for public opinion.
	Sri Lanka and India are also discussing possible collaboration in the areas of power sharing and energy, revisiting the undersea power transmission project. ?Both countries have agreed to do a feasibility study,? he said. (The Hindu)

CB Bonds: JVP asks Governor to step down
	
	The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today called for the removal of Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran from his post until the investigation into the controversial bond issue was completed.
	JVP parliamentarian Sunil Handunneththi said the Governor should be removed or he should resign from his post to pave the way for a proper investigation into the one-billion-rupee bond issue, which the JVP describes as a shady deal.
	Mr. Handunneththi said the bond issue appeared questionable or controversial for several reasons. He said the bonds were to be issued at a market rate of 9.5 per cent to raise Rs.1 billion but it was ultimately issued at 12.5 per cent raising Rs.10 billion.
	Mr. Handunneththi said bonds are usually awarded to several parties in blocks so as to make the interest rates competitive but in this case bonds worth Rs.5 billion had been issued to a company owned by the governor?s son-in-law at an average of 12.3 per cent resulting in Rs.2 billion loss for the Government.(YP & DS)

Exclusive: Cameron on his meeting with Maithripala
	
	Following is the Op-ed piece by British Prime Minister David Cameron exclusively for the Daily Mirror on his scheduled meeting with visiting President Maithripala Sirisena today.Prime Minister David Cameron article for Daily Mirror:
	?
	Ever since my visit to Sri Lanka in 2013 I have been determined to help address the issues of Sri Lanka?s past and put the country on the path to a brighter, peaceful and prosperous future. Since my visit, a UN led investigation into alleged war crimes by all sides in the conflict has got underway. And the people of Sri Lanka have elected a new President who has made clear that he is fully committed to reconciliation and reform.
	?
	The new Sri Lankan government has a real opportunity to unlock Sri Lanka?s enormous potential through economic, political and social reform, and by fairly and transparently addressing the issues of the past. And that will be my message to President Sirisena when I hold my first meeting with him in Downing Street today.
	?
	President Sirisena has already taken encouraging steps - the release of some military land, the appointment of civilian governors for the North and East and the President?s visit to the North of Sri Lanka to discuss Tamil issues.
	?
	In response to this open and progressive stance by President Sirisena, which is a dramatic contrast to that of his predecessor Mr Rajapaksa, we supported the proposal from the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to extend the timetable of his report by six months.
	?
	We did this because we want to see genuine reconciliation in Sri Lanka. And we believe that the extra time enables the new Sri Lankan government to engage with the UN investigation, as it has committed to do, and to establish its own credible accountability processes.
	?
	I will encourage President Sirisena to seize this window of opportunity.? The Sri Lankan government must keep up the pace on reform. Building trust by demilitarising the North, handing more land back from the military to local communities and releasing detainees held without charge.
	?
	And I will urge President Sirisena to deliver on his commitments to tackle the challenges that are holding Sri Lanka back. Strengthening respect for human rights, eradicating corruption, improving political accountability and ensuring the freedom of the press. These are all essential elements of a democratic, fair and functioning state. If President Sirisena can achieve his ambitious programme of reform then I truly believe he can help to heal the deep wounds of war and rebuild this beautiful country.
	?
	I will never forget the faces of those I met in Jaffna over a year ago. Their stories of unbearable suffering and loss will stay with me forever and continue to drive me in pushing for change. What I saw and heard also underlined why I went there in the first place: to shine a light on the lack of progress and to help bring about international pressure for reform.
	?
	We owe it to victims and survivors across Sri Lanka to ensure that those responsible are held to account. And we will not forget them. That?s why we, and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, have made clear that the report must be published and discussed by September 2015 and we will stick to that.
	?
	In six months time the spotlight will be back on Sri Lanka. Let it shine on a nation that is prepared to address its past, reconcile its differences and reform its political structures so it can secure a bright future for all its peoples. And let it shine on a renewed and growing partnership between the UK and Sri Lanka.

I did everything according to the law: Gota
	
	Commenting on the foreign travel restriction imposed on him in connection with the floating armoury of Avant-Garde, former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa yesterday said he had never done anything illegal and always stood by the law.
	He said he had already given all the details in connection with the incident to the CID and criticized the impounding of his passport claiming even the probe into the incident was not completed.
	?We never left the country regardless what difficulties we had to face. Some people are attempting to portray us as thieves and murderers to the world. But people of this country know what we did and who we are. We never looted public properties. It is unfair to hinder us, who served the country, this way,? he said.
	Mr. Rajapaksa charged that moves against them were being plotting to gain political advantage and said the image of those behind these moves will be tarnished. ?I know that a few officers of the Attorney General?s Department are involved in this,? he said. (Sujith Hewajulige)

?No Fire Zone? movie in Sinhala
	
Channel 4 film director Callum Macrae who exposed Sri Lanka's alleged war crimes and took the famous picture of LTTE supremo Velupillai Prabhakaran's son eating a snack just before he was shot dead will release a new Sinhala version of his award winning documentary "No Fire Zone" in the premises of the House of Commons possibly souring Britain's relation with Sri Lanka.
According to the Times of India, The launch will be attended by director Callum Macrae and will have the presence of British MPs?Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh, Conservative MP Lee Scott and others from parliament.
The documentary was nominated for the prestigious Emmy award. India refused the film a censorship certificate, explaining in part that it might "strain friendly relations with Sri Lanka." India also refused a visa to director Callum Macrae.
The meeting will also be addressed by exiled Sinhalese writer Bashana Abeywardane.
The release of the version will coincide with the visit of the new Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena to the UK and will take place a day before he is due to have dinner with the Queen.
Macrae says: "The films intend to allow the majority Sinhala population to see for the first time the shocking evidence of war crimes and massacres committed at the end of the war by their own government's forces."
The producers said they will challenge the current ban on the film in India, Malaysia and Nepal.
The film was described by Prime Minister David Cameron as "one of the most chilling documentaries I have watched".
But until now the film has been effectively banned in Sri Lanka. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had asked the public to inform on anyone "secretly helping" the filmmakers.
However president Sirisena's government has repeatedly promised to lift restrictions on the internet "and end the intimidation, enforced disappearances and killings of journalists in Sri Lanka," said Macrae.

This Govt. no second to former: Anti Corruption Front
	
The Anti Corruption Front (ACF) today charged that the present government was no second to the former government considering the frauds and corruption that had occurred during the first 59 days of 100 days programme.
The ACF insisted on a fully-fledged inquiry into an alleged insider dealing that had taken place during the financial bonds issue by the Central Bank (CB).
There were reports of alleged deals made by Perpetual Treasuries, a firm with connections to Arjun Aloysius, the son-in-law of the current governor, Arjun Mahendran.
ACF member Shiral Lakthilake urged the CB Governor to make a public statement on this matter.
?Appointing a three member committee to investigate this is not enough. A formal, transparent investigation is essential. The governor should resign temporarily till the investigation is completed. That is the only way to ensure transparency,? he said.
The Front said it was necessary to conduct an internal management audit at all government institutions as a measure to eradicate frauds and corruption. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Video: Foreign Ministry has no use for super luxury coaches
	
	Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Ajith P. Perera said today that no use could be made of the two super luxury coaches found abandoned in the Ministry premises.
	?Those two coaches were not brought for the use of the Foreign Ministry and we intend to sell these in the open market for a good price. But there was a difficulty in finding persons who could use these coaches? he said.
	The present government and other officials cannot make the use of these coaches, so we use these coaches for tourism until such time as we can sell them.
	We are not like the previous government to use the country?s assets for the advancement of one family, we are not like them and we will take the necessary legal action at the right time. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
