Disintegrating order in a drifting world Global developments do not auger well for democracies
	
What we are witnessing today across the world is unprecedented, be it the triumph of Donald Trump in the United States, the fast changing political landscape in Europe, almost total failure of the United Nations to prevent the massive displacement and miserable state of civilians caught in the Syrian conflict or the worsening environmental situation in many parts of the world including global cities like Paris?to Beijing.
Global institutions and existing international agreements appear to be ineffective in reining in the forces that have been unleashed by neoliberalism and technological advances over the last several decades. While economic globalization and the ICT revolution have integrated the world as never before, governments and global institutions have failed to reduce economic inequality both within and across countries.
Increasing international competition for resources and markets has forced governments to reduce taxes and relax environmental controls, and these in turn have aggravated the problems of inequality and environmental degradation. In spite of the growing criticism of the emergent global economic order by the leftist intellectuals both within and outside many global institutions, particularly in Europe, governments have failed to curb the influence of vested interests on public policies.
It is the above policy paralysis that has often pushed the masses into the fold of demagogues and populist politicians in many countries across the world. In spite of frequent change of governments in the United States bringing into power liberally minded leaders from time to time, their ability to bring about drastic policy changes has been curbed by powerful vested interests. This has been particularly so over the last few decades, frustrating and marginalising large segments of the underprivileged strata of society.?
Most recent popular agitations about the plight of the 99 percent against the super rich 1 percent of the population exemplified by Occupy Wall Street movement in the United States were a clear warning to the comfortable middle and upper middle class leadership of centre left parties in the western world. Yet, what these parties could accomplish in the face of resistance from the corporate leaders driven by the profit motive has not been very significant.?
As is well documented today, income inequality and working conditions have continually deteriorated in many countries across the world. Often economic growth has not been accompanied by secure employment even in fast growing economies like South Korea. Growing economic and social pressure coupled with a sense of uncertainty in less developed countries have encouraged many people to become inward looking, support popular nationalist parties and find scape goats to compensate for their own inadequacies. Widespread ethnic and religious tensions in many parts of the world have been the result.?
The developments outlined above do not auger well for democracy. If the liberal and social democratic leaders are defeated by populist politicians in leading democracies in the world, the democratic process, good governance and socially just and environmentally concerned and responsible policy making are more than likely to be subverted under the influence of sectarian and vested interests. There are already signs of this happening. When the global institutions like the United Nations and long standing international conventions become ineffective in upholding the long established normative order in the world, we are likely to enter an era of great uncertainty and instability.?
Most recent popular agitations about the plight of the 99 percent against the super rich 1 percent of the population exemplified by Occupy Wall Street movement in the United States were a clear warning to the comfortable middle and upper middle class leadership of centre left parties in the western world.?
But the irony is that we are facing this prospect at a time when the need of the hour is the exact opposite. This becomes quite obvious when we look at the range of deep seated economic, social, political and environmental problems that we witness in the world today. The cases in point are massive international migration of refugees and workers, persisting mass poverty, violent ethnic?
and religious conflicts and?global warming.?
The above issues are certainly not going to get resolved on their own. They demand concerted global and national interventions fortified by scientific evidence.?
The Sustainable Development Goals unveiled by the UN in 2015 and the Paris Agreement on climate change ratified in 2016 are two initiatives that the world leaders and global and national institutions need to make all efforts to implement in the next several decades in order to save the planet and create social and economic conditions that ensure oppressed and struggling masses in different parts of the world live decent lives with human dignity. Such collective efforts are indispensable to bring about the global societal and political transformation required to make SDGs a reality.?
Yet, the persisting global economic policy environment and the current political trends in almost all parts of the world are not helpful to bring about such a transformation. So, all democratically minded people with a sense of social justice and environmentally conscious responsibility, irrespective of their station in life need to work hard to mobilise public opinion and social and political pressure to bring about the social transformation required to human induced disasters, both social and environmental.?
In Sri Lanka, we need to overcome divisions created by sectarian forces and vested interest to mobilise people and public opinion around collective goals of social justice, eradication of poverty, national reconciliation and environmental security.

India set to test launch Agni 5 missile
	
India is set to test its indigenously developed intercontinental surface-to-surface nuclear capable ballistic missile ?Agni-5? from the Wheeler Island off Odisha coast today, the ANI reported.
The three stage solid propellant missile is to be test-fired from a mobile launcher from the launch complex-4 of the Integrated Test Range (ITR).
It will be fourth developmental and second canisterised trial of the long-range missile. While the first test was conducted on April 19, 2012, the second test was carried out on September 15, 2013 and the third on January 31, 2015 from the same base.
Unlike other missiles of Agni series, the latest one ?Agni-5? is the most advanced having some new technologies incorporated with it in terms of navigation and guidance, warhead and engine.
Agni-V is a three-stage missile designed to carry over one-tonne warhead. Its 5,000 km range gives it the farthest reach among all Indian missiles.

New Pension scheme, Govt ready with draft
	
The Public Administration Ministry had drafted the bill for the introduction of a new pension scheme for Public Servants and had submitted to President Maitripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for consideration, a Minister said yesterday.
The bill, if enacted, will provide for the establishment of a contributory pension fund for public servants joining the service in future.
Subject Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara told the Daily Mirror yesterday the proposed ?National Pension Bill? had been drafted at the moment to introduce a contributory pension scheme.
?There is no Parliamentary law governing pension at the moment. We have only a minute,? he said.
?We will now enact legislation to create a fund. Similar funds exist in countries such as Japan, India and Europe. We studied all such models and worked out our own system. Ours contains features taken from all,? he said.
The Minister said Rs. 1 billion had been allocated in the budget for it.
?Alongside, we will get another Rs.3-4 billion from a separate fund. Then, we can start the fund with Rs. 5 billion. In Japan, the pension fund contains as much as Yen 71 trillion,? he said.
The Ministry is planning to hold talks with the trade union sector soon about the new bill.(Kelum Bandara)

PHU urges PM to reveal promises made to Tamil and Western forces
	
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) today urged Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to reveal the promises made by him to the Tamil separatists and Western forces before the dawn of the New Year 2017.
Addressing a media briefing, PHU General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila said earlier Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Leader C.V.Wigneswaran and MP M.A. Sumanthiran had urged the Government to fulfill the promise made by them to the TNA and other international forces.
?Everyone stresses the Government to fulfill their promises, but nobody is willing to reveal what are these promises. The Government has not even mentioned such kind of promises in the Presidential and Parliamentary Election Policies,? he added.
He said the Government had still not fulfilled even a single demand of the TNA and added that the people should have the utmost right to know what were the promises made by the Government to them.
He said perhaps President Maithripala Sirisena could be unaware of these issues since the Prime Minister and the Foreign Affairs Minister were usually engaged in matters related to the international forces in order to topple the former Government.
?The Prime Minister should immediately reveal these promises to the country. Only then we will be able to predict whether 2017 would be a prosperous year or not,? he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Pop superstar George Michael dies at 53
	
Pop star George Michael has died aged 53 at his home in Oxfordshire. The musician's publicist said that he had 'passed away peacefully' at his property in Goring at 1.42pm today, the Daily Mail reported.
Michael's former manager Michael Lippman claimed he had died in bed as a result of 'heart failure.'
Thames Valley Police said officers were called to a property in Goring-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, shortly before 2pm on Christmas Day.
A spokesman said: 'Sadly, a 53-year-old man was confirmed deceased at the scene. At this stage the death is being treated as unexplained but not suspicious.'
His Wham! bandmate Andrew Ridgeley and close friend Elton John have lead the tributes to the star on social media.
Posting on Twitter, musician Ridgeley wrote: 'Heartbroken at the loss of my beloved friend Yog. Me, his loved ones, his friends, the world of music, the world at large. 4ever loved. A xx'
While John posted a heartfelt message along with a picture of the pair together on his Instagram page.
He wrote: 'I am in deep shock. I have lost a beloved friend - the kindest, most generous soul and a brilliant artist. My heart goes out to his family and all of his fans. @GeorgeMichael #RIP'
Michael, who was set to release a documentary in 2017, rose to fame as a member of Wham! who were known for their hits Club Tropicana and Last Christmas.
The singer - whose real name is Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou - sold more than 100 million albums throughout a career spanning almost four decades.
In a statement, Michael's publicist said: 'It is with great sadness that we can confirm our beloved son, brother and friend George passed away peacefully at home over the Christmas period.
'The family would ask that their privacy be respected at this difficult and emotional time. There will be no further comment at this stage.'
The singer's death comes as he planned to work on a new album with UK producer Naughty Boy.
In an interview with the BBC earlier this month, the producer, who has worked with a list of stars including Beyonce, said: 'I can't wait. I don't know what to expect. And, to be honest, he's more mysterious than anyone else so I'm actually excited.
'I reached out and then he got back.
'He's got an album coming out next year, and he's going to be doing something for my album as well.'
Naughty Boy paid tribute tonight by tweeting the title of one of Michael's hits, he simply posted: 'jesus to a child.'
While enjoying a glittering life onstage, Michael has endured a turbulent personal life and nearly died from pneumonia while on tour in late 2011.
After receiving treatment in a Vienna hospital, he made a tearful appearance outside his London home and said it had been 'touch and go' whether he lived.
Doctors had performed a tracheotomy to keep his airways open and he was unconscious for some of his spell in hospital.
He later told the Daily Mail: 'It almost killed me. On a subconscious level, it was very frightening and I'll probably never feel quite as safe in life again.
'But I also remember experiencing incredible guilt for my family and friends, because they literally spent weeks not knowing whether I was going to make it.
'Now, if that had happened to me in reverse, if I'd had to watch one of my sisters go through that, well... it would have devastated me.
For most of the time, though, I was pretty much out of it, so I didn't realise the danger I was in until after I'd come out the other side.' ?
Michael had also struggled with drug addiction and admitted that during one period he was smoking 25 joints a day. In 2008, he was caught smoking crack cocaine in a public toilet.
As the world comes to terms with the loss of one of its greatest pop stars, celebrity fans have taken to Twitter to share their grief.
Ricky Gervais, who cast Michael in an episode of his sitcom Extras, wrote: 'Unbelievable. RIP George Michael.'
Hit producer Mark Ronson wrote: 'Other than a global pop phenom [sic], George was one of the true British soul greats a lot of us owe him an unpayable debt. Bye George xx'
Spandau Ballet's official account posted: 'We are incredibly sad at the passing of our dear friend George Michael. A brilliant artist great songwriter.'

Rice above all Rice crisis fifty years ago: In Dec 1966, JR saw an Opportunity; Dudley, the compassi
	
Sri Lanka is heading towards foreseeable crisis centring rice. This is not the first time we are up against a rice crisis, nor will it be the last. In 1943 and 1944, a rice slump was countered with a slashed half-measure all rounds. Rice is the staple food of Sri Lankans. It is a politically perceptive commodity with which delivery disruption causes people grief. ??
The National government of Dudley Senanayake [1965-1970] was National by every sense of its meaning. With de facto Tamil leader, S.J.V. Chelvanayakam, Sinhala extremist K.M.P. Rajaratne, father of Marxism Philip Gunawardane and a pillar of Western Capitalism, J.R. Jayewardene all united under statesman Dudley. ??
However, it suffered a serious setback five decades ago, when it lost all three bye-elections held on October 24, 1966. The opposition led by Sirimavo?s SLFP as usual focused on the ethnic issue during the campaign highlighting the fact that main Tamil party [Chelvanayakam Federal Party] was in an unprincipled alliance with the UNP. ??
Reeling from the loss, the government confronted an even more serious problem. The major share of rice supplies were coming from Burma as the local production then was far below the requirements. In December Burmese harvest failed drastically resulting in failure to deliver the quantity of rice contracted. The ?Hal Potha? [ration card], a legacy of World War II, introduced by colonial rulers which was considered by the people as their birthright was in operation. ?
Under this arrangement every adult citizen was entitled to two measures [2 kgs] of rice at a highly subsidized price. In fact a measure costing -/70 cents was sold at -/25 cents to the consumer. By the end of December 1966 no rice was available from any source to supply people with the ration per person per week. ??
?J.R. Jayewardene, State [Super?] Minister in 1966 ?
The Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake was presented with a problem that he never wished to avoid dealing with; either a price increase or a reduction in the ration. The Hartal of 1953 a violent mass agitation triggered by withdrawal of the subsidy was backed by Marxist parties, which in turn had led to his own resignation as PM yet haunting him. JR Jayewardene, State [Super?] Minister in 1966, advised by Esmond Wickremesinghe [father of Ranil W.] consulted an Indian economist named Professor BR Shenoy, who presented a paper proposing a reversal of popular economic policies and introduction of a radically different approach. ??
Such views had little chance of adoption in this country in 1960s though the ?Super Minister? JR was much readier to consider the need for a reduction in the rice ration, and price it at close to the price at which it was purchased from Burma as possible. But he could not convince Dudley who earlier in the year disagreed with the IMF too, when it recommended a cut in subsidy, in spite of government?s earlier undertaking that it would review the subsidy. ?
?A committee, as usually done by UNP governments, was appointed to make recommendations on the matter. The committee came up with a few alternatives; all of them required an increase in price or reduction in the ration or both. ??
Apart from that, agricultural education for farmers and development of irrigation and transport systems are other approaches that could be pursued. ?
The government was desperate realizing that it was not possible to continue with the ration of 2 kgs per person per week. The impending rice crisis saw JRJ and his PM adopt different attitudes. JR regarded the crisis as an opportunity to make radical policy change in subsidies and extend it to changes in economic and fiscal policies as well. ??
Dudley Senanayake was opposed to any tampering with food subsidies; the events of 1953 and the Hartal in August of the year were deeply etched in his memory. ??
JR?s and his chief adviser Esmond Wickremesinghe combination during the rice crisis made Dudley suspicious of JR, he felt that any recommendation to review of the policy on food subsidies, let alone for their elimination, was a trap they had laid for him, in the apparent hope that if political disturbances erupted as a result JR would be benefitted and replaced him as PM. ??
Whatever, the good intentions the Prime Minister had and no one doubted he had them?were negated by the pampering offer of free rice. His cabinet, doubtless, played on the traditional feeling that Sri Lankans welcome anything free?even a headache. But the short term lure opens the gates to long term disaster. Finally PM bowed down, ?This is a war? he declared, ?We must cushion the blow,? so two measures was reduced to one, but it would be issued free. ?
Increase in Demand during the 1940 ??
There has been an increase in demand during the 1940 and early 50 decades for rice in many parts of the world especially in China, the Middle East, Africa, India and Sri Lanka. To counteract the increase in price, the top exporting countries of rice have reduced their exports considerably to keep home prices low and to offset inflation. There were several factors that added to the rice crisis of?
which some were beyond the government?s discretion. ?
The skyrocketing crude oil prices in the world market made fertilizers in the production of rice much more expensive. It also contributed to the upward trend in the cost of rice since transportation was a charge added by providers. ?
Opposition Reacts ?
And from 1948 to 1953, an equally grim situation touched off a half measure reduction, though the price remained untouched until 1953, when the full subsidy was withdrawn. The Marxists, LSSP and CP backed by their powerful Trade Union arms IN 1966 professed violent street protest in line with 1953 Hartal. But its major partner the SLFP headed by Sirimavo Bandaranaike was not in favour. Especially Leader of Opposition Sirimavo vehemently objected to the idea. ??
The Current Rice Crisis ?
The Director General of Meteorology says that Sri Lanka will receive less rainfall in January and February. According to the Director General, even if there is rainfall there is no solution regarding the scarcity of water. ?
In areas like Polonnaruwa, Hambantota and Anuradhapura where a better harvest is expected, cultivation during the Maha season has been limited. Of the 190,000 acres of paddy land in the Kurunegala District, only 19,000 acres has been cultivated. That is a warning which has come from the Sri Lankan farmers. Lack of rain and issues surrounding fertilizer have caused a situation where the anticipated harvest for the Maha Season cannot be collected. There is a possibility that this year?s Maha season harvest would be half of what was obtained last year. ?
?The ?Hal Potha? [ration card], a legacy of World War II, introduced by colonial rulers which was considered by the people as their birthright was in operation.?
National organizer ? All Ceylon Peasants Federation has said, ?? the farmers were not provided with fertilizer on time in order to yield a successful harvest. Fertilizer is required within 45 days. Minister P. Harrison says, the Paddy Marketing Board has made a decision to release paddy stocks. He also added that there would be positive news for the consumers. ?? orders have been given to the private importers to import nadu rice, and that the price of rice would be reduced. But it would be immature to think that this crisis is restricted to Sri Lanka. According to the most recent reports, the entire region (where the staple food is rice) is facing a `rice crisis` of an unparalleled scale. Food prices are moving up globally and rice is no exception. ?
Sri Lanka is heading for a sharp drop in rice production in the main cultivation season with only a third of the area sown so far amid the worst drought in at least five years, with import restrictions already pushing rice prices up. Already rice prices have gone up, with the market reacting quickly to tighter supply conditions and the expected future position. B. V. R. Punyawardena, agro-climatologist at the Department of Agriculture has said that by early December only 30 percent of the 830,000 hectares of paddy that can be grown during Maha rice cultivation season has been sown. He added, ?I have not experienced this kind of bad season, International prices could also move up, with variable La Nina conditions. Punyawardena said.? ?
Long-term solutions to the crisis ?
The long-term solutions that are being proposed by successive governments are geared towards the country attaining self-sufficiency and aimed at revolutionizing the production process and reduction of the cost of production. It could be achieved through investments in research. Apart from that, agricultural education for farmers and development of irrigation and transport systems are other approaches that could be pursued. ?Agriculture-related technology should be improved so as to increase the quality of rice. Finally, we can certainly end this rice crisis if we stop the conversion of agricultural lands into industrial centres to a halt. ?

Snowden seeks help for SL family in Hong Kong who helped him
	
Whistleblower Edward Snowden made a Christmas request to his Twitter followers to help the refugee families living in Hong Kong that sheltered him after he left the US and while he worked to expose the scope of the National Security Agency's information-gathering.
A fundraising effort was launched earlier this month for the individuals that helped Snowden. Their lawyer says the Hong Kong government has been retaliating against him and against them.
?
Robert Tibbo, a Canadian barrister who advised Snowden in Hong Kong in 2013, also represents asylum-seekers Supun Thilina Kellapatha and his partner, Nadeeka, from Sri Lanka, and Vanessa Mae Bondalian Rodel from the Philippines, all of whom allowed the NSA whistleblower to stay in their tiny city accommodations while he hid in Hong Kong in 2013 before being granted asylum in Russia.
After two years of inactivity, 30 of Tibbo's cases were suddenly reactivated in mid-December, he told the South China Morning Post. There was no way he could meet the mass of urgent new deadlines given his other work commitments, Tibbo said, and he has missed key document filing deadlines for his clients despite proposing alternate schedules.
"I understand I have been particularly targeted. They all know I have 30 cases that have been held in limbo and now this happens," he said, the South China Morning Post reported.
Snowden also stayed with Ajith Pushpakumara, another Sri Lankan refugee whose asylum claim is not considered at risk because crucial paperwork has already been filed, but who is included in the fundraising effort.)
Hong Kong is not a signatory to the UN's refugee convention and does not grant asylum, but it is bound by the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (UNCAT) and considers protection claims on those grounds. It also considers claims based on risk of persecution, Yahoo News reports.
Many refugees spend years in waiting for the government to screen their claims. Those that are found to have merit are referred to the UNHCR, which may then try to resettle them to a third country. But fewer than one percent of cases are ever successfully substantiated by Hong Kong authorities, according to Yahoo News.
"Hong Kong's acceptance rate for asylum-seekers is effectively zero," Marc-Andr? S?guin, an immigration specialist, told Canada's Globe and Mail. S?guin is one of the three Montreal lawyers who launched the campaign to support and ultimately resettled the refugees who helped Snowden.
In a video made by AFP earlier this month, Tibbo explains that his clients were destitute. They are barred from working in Hong Kong as their cases are pending. They didn't have enough money for rent or food, he said, and their bills were not being paid by international social services, which he called a serious deprivation of their basic needs and a violation of their constitutional rights.
Rodel told the Globe and Mail, "I can't go back because something bad will happen to me, especially now with our new president," referring to Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte's support for extrajudicial killings. "I think for me he could easily shoot me. He could do anything. All I want is for me and my daughter, my family, to be safe and have freedom. And I want to work and get an education for my daughter."
Tibbo has been criticized for involving his clients, but said that they wanted to help. German Chancellor Angela Merkel ? AFP 2016/ MAURIZIO GAMBARINI Critics Corner Merkel by 'Linking Every Refugee Crime to Her Policy' "We tried to explain magnitude to the families. They said ?We understand, we understand.' They wanted to help, wanted to feel useful," Tibbo said, according to the Globe and Mail.
The group hopes to raise $100,000 by mid-March. So far, it has raised $8,735.(Sputniknews)
