I reiterate that the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) is illegal said the Minister of Science Technology and Research Susil Premajayantha yesterday.
Speaking further, he maintained that only those who are not conversant with the law are scared of these institutions and he was not one of them.
The minister made these remarks in reply to a question posed by journalists at a press briefing held at the SLFP headquarters yesterday.
He said that due to certain actions by the FCID, it led to certain individuals gaining popularity, especially when a minister or a MP is arrested and legal action is filed. He said this could translate into an election victory for the person instigating the arrest.
Referring to the formation of the FCID he said this was not an uncommon phenomenon as with the change of government new law enforcement arms also pop up.

## Title: Mexican President cancels meeting with Trump over wall

Mexican President cancels meeting with Trump over wall
	
US President Donald J. Trumps decision to build a wall along the southern border escalated into a diplomatic standoff on Thursday, with Mexicos President publicly canceling a scheduled meeting at the White House and Mr. Trump firing back, accusing Mexico of burdening the US with illegal immigrants, criminals and a trade deficit.
Mr. Trumps push to fulfill his campaign pledge and build a border wall brought to a head months of simmering tensions, culminating in a remarkable back-and-forth between the two leaders.
According to the New York Times, Mr. Trumps spokesman has said the President would pay for the border wall by imposing a 20 percent tax on imports to the United States, which he said would raise billions of dollars.
The sparring began Thursday morning when the president of Mexico announced on Twitter that he was canceling his meeting with Mr. Trump next week, rejecting the visit after the new American leader ordered the border wall between the two nations.
Having called for dialogue in the face of Mr. Trumps vows to build a wall during the American presidential campaign, President Enrique Pea Nieto ultimately bowed to public pressure in Mexico to respond more forcefully to his northern neighbor.
On Wednesday, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to beef up the nations deportation force and start construction on a new wall along the border. Adding to the perceived insult was the timing of the order: It came on the first day of talks between top Mexican officials and their counterparts in Washington, and just days before the meeting between the two presidents.
Mr. Trumps action was enough to prompt Mr. Pea Nieto to start discussing whether to scrap his plans to visit the White House, according to Mexican officials. In a video message delivered over Twitter on Wednesday night, Mr. Pea Nieto reiterated his commitment to protect the interests of Mexico and the Mexican people, and he chided the move in Washington to continue with the wall.
I regret and condemn the United States decision to continue with the construction of a wall that, for years now, far from uniting us, divides us, he said.
Then on Thursday morning, Mr. Trump fired back, warning that he might cancel the meeting himself if Mexico did not agree to pay for the wall.
Just before Mr. Trump fired off his Twitter post, the Mexican foreign minister and Mr. Trumps Homeland Security secretary, John F. Kelly, were preparing to see each other for a scheduled 11:30 a.m. meeting.
According to a senior American official, the secretary had been briefed. The appropriate flags had been arranged by the protocol staff at the Department of Homeland Security. Then, just as American officials greeted the minister outside the departments headquarters in Northwest Washington, the minister received word from Mexico that he was being pulled back, the official said. The meeting never happened.
By early afternoon, Mr. Trump said it was the United States that was being treated unfairly.
We have agreed to cancel our planned meeting, Mr. Trump said in a news conference Thursday afternoon. Unless Mexico is going to treat the U.S. fairly, with respect, such a meeting would be fruitless, and I want to go a different route. We have no choice.
In Mexico, Mr. Pea Nieto had little political room to maneuver. With Mr. Trumps order to build the wall, the perceived insults Mexico had endured during the campaign had finally turned into action. Decades of friendly relations between the nations  on matters involving trade, security and migration  seemed to be unraveling.
Calls began to come in from across the political spectrum for Mr. Pea Nieto to cancel his visit, and to respond with greater fortitude to the perceived menace from President Trump. On Twitter, Mr. Trumps action was referred to by politicians and historians as a an offense to Mexico, a slap in the face and a monument to lies.
Historians said that not since President Calvin Coolidge threatened to invade a Soviet Mexico had the United States so deeply antagonized the Mexican populace.
It is an unprecedented moment for the bilateral relationship, said Genaro Lozano, a professor at the Iberoamerican University in Mexico City. In the 19th century, we fought a war with the U.S.; now we find ourselves in a low-intensity war, a commercial one over Nafta and an immigration war due to the measures he just announced.

Mexico will NOT pay for any wall: President Nieto
	

Mexicos President Enrique Pena Nieto hit back at Donald Trumps order to start building a wall separating the country from the United States - and vowed that Mexicans would not foot the bill, despite what Trump has said. 
Mexico does not believe in walls. Ive said it time and time again: Mexico will not pay for any wall, Pena Nieto said in a video published Wednesday evening. The Mexican president said he regrets and rejects the US decision to build a wall. 
Meanwhile Trump insisted in an ABC News interview Wednesday that Mexico would absolutely pay for the wall, but failed to clearly explain how that would happen. 
Pena Nieto said in his video statement Wednesday that he had asked his government to strengthen protection for Mexican immigrants.Ive asked for the minister of Foreign Relations to re-enforce protection measures to our citizens, he said.Mexico offers and demands respect like the fully sovereign nation we are, he said. Mexico gives its friendship to the people of the United States and wishes to reach agreements with its government - agreements that will be in favor of Mexico and Mexicans. 
Trumps order came the same day Mexicos foreign relations and economy secretaries arrived in Washington for talks with his administration, and its timing was seen by many in Mexico as a slap in the face.

NARA recommends Min.of Fisheries to ban Humphead killing
	
The National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) yesterday said it would soon send its recommendations to the Ministry of Fisheries to ban the killing of Humphead fish in Sri Lanka.
Recent killing of this species was reported in the Unawatuna area because pictures of killing a Humphead went viral on social media recently.
NARAs Marine Biology division head Dr. Sisira Haputantri said the fish Humphead Wrasse scientifically identified as Cheilinus Undulates is listed as an endangered species category in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list of threatened species.
He further said that Sri Lanka had not yet implemented a law against killing this fish.
Dr. Sisira Haputantri said the Humphead Wrasse one of the largest living member of the family Labridaeis an enormous coral reef fish-growing over six feet long-with a prominent bulge on its forehead and it is a very rare fish that was identified as an endangered fish. The fish could be seen in Sri Lankas coral reef sea water areas but is nowhere common."
Spear fishing which is the greatest threat that these fish facing, in many areas of the country. Unfortunately no regulation has been implemented yet to save this fish. But we will send our recommendation immediately to the Ministry of Fisheries to implement such a rule as a measure to save this species", he said.
Spear fishing activities using spear guns also should be banned and the law should be armed with sufficient regulations to save these endangered species, he said.
Speaking on the matter, Department of the Wild Life Conservation Deputy General (Law) , S P A G B. Samarakoon confirmed that no regulation had been passed so far to protect these species but they have identified the need and working on to implement one in near future.
According to the Wild Lifes Fauna and Flora protection (Amendment) Act, No. 22 of 2009 this variety of fish has not been listed as an endangered species in Sri Lanka.
However, the Daily Mirror learns that the there is a sudden hike in fish hunting specially involving big ornamental fish which has a demand in the international market.

Never requested SL for exclusivity in HIZ: China
	
China has never asked Sri Lanka to allow only Chinese enterprises to operate inside the Hambantota Industrial Zone (HIZ), Chinas Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying said yesterday.
According to Chinas Foreign Ministry, she expressed these views in response to a question posed to her about whether China had asked Sri Lanka to ensure that the industrial zone was only for Chinese companies to operate in.
When asked whether China had forced Sri Lanka to offer them concessions with regards to the Hambantota Port because of how much Sri Lanka owed China and how concerned China was with regard to the protests that took place in Hambantota against the HIZ, Chunying said small-scale protests had taken place mainly because the locals had misconstrued the relevant policies concerning the projects.
The Sri Lankan side has made an official clarification on this. As the two countries are traditional neighbours, China is willing to provide the best assistance it can to help Sri Lanka with its economic development so as to achieve common development objectives. This is in the interests of both countries, she said.
The Spokesperson said Chinese enterprises always discussed the Hambantota Port project with the Sri Lankan side on a voluntary basis, in the spirit of equality and mutual benefit and following market rules.Relevant cooperation projects are expected to play a constructive role in the long-term development of the Hambantota Port and other parts of the country, she said.

President Sirisena brought me back to politics: MR
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said today it was President Maithripala Sirisena, who brought him back to politics whereas he had decided to retire from politics.
I was going to retire from politics and take a rest. But President Sirisena brought me back to politics, he said.
Mr. Rajapaksa said the Joint Opposition members Wimal Weerawansa, Dinesh Gunawardane and Vasudewa Nanayakkara during a meeting held at Nugegoda sometime ago forced him to return to active politics and not to retire.
Addressing a rally organised by the Joint Opposition in Nugegoda, he said the government was drafting a Constitution which would divide the country and betray the historic war victory.
The leaders and people have a responsibility to safeguard the historic victory we achieved. People gathered here urged the government to give up this new Constitution, he said.
He said what the government had promised was not to divide the country but to bestow the executive powers on the Parliament. The government has neglected its promise and trying to bring in a deceitful Constitution instead. That is what we are opposed to, he said.
Mr. Rajapaksa said he accepted that there was an issue in the country and added that they invited the government to resolve it but it rejected their invitation due to the influence by the international community. The international community forced the government not to deal with me as I did not bow down to them and I said and did what I wanted, he said.
He said the government had put the country in a debt trap and added that it had done nothing from the loans obtained.
There is noting the government has done from the loans obtained. It claims that the loans were obtained to repay the loans. But it is an utter lie. We had obtained long term loans. They are selling State institutions, lands and ports. We warn the people who purchase these State property to be careful. Those who plundered billions of rupees from the Central Bank scam are trying to launch TV channels, newspapers and banks. We warn them and we will seize all the money defrauded as soon as we came to power, he said.
The former President said the GSP+ facility was removed during his tenure as the per capita income was increased in the country and added that the present government was going to embrace the GSP+ facility when other countries were leaving it due to the conditions imposed. We urge the government not to destroy our culture and tradition by agreeing to disastrous conditions. It is a clear indication as where this government is heading to," he said.
Prof. G.L. Peiris said it was a ploy of the SLFP to invite the Joint Opposition members to join it and added that they would not get caught to it.
Several JO parliamentarians, including Gamini Lokuge, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Udhaya Gammanpila and Vasudewa Nanayakkara addressed the rally. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Rajiv's SL intervention helped him win election: CIA
	
The CIA, top American intelligence agency, had observed in 1987 that Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had intervened in Sri Lankan crisis to win Haryana State assembly election, the Indian Express reported on Thursday.
The CIA intelligence memo dated June 8, 1987, which has been declassified by the CIA observed that Indias decision to airlift humanitarian aid to Sri Lankan Tamils was to gain Hindu sympathy.
He (Rajiv Gandhi) probably believes such dramatic actions on behalf of Hindus in Sri Lanka will help win over Indian Hindus before critical election next week in Haryana state, the CIA memo said.
Over a month later, another CIA memo (July 29, 1987) criticised Rajiv Gandhi for having short-term view of things. And, that was the day when India and Sri Lanka signed a peace accord that included provision for Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF). The CIA memo reads; Sri Lanka, moreover, could become a military entanglement for India.
Gandhi tends to have a short-term view of things and may not see the pitfalls in trying to achieve a cheap victory using the tougher line on Sri Lanka.
A CIA intelligence officer memo suggested that Rajivs move in Sri Lanka was keeping in the view Indias determination to be the dominant regional power in South Asia.
We do not, however, believe Gandhi or his advisers have a greater India in mind. New Delhi may instead aspire to a relationship with Colombo that resembles its ties to Nepal, over which India exercises strong influence.
The CIA also believed certain political advantage to Rajiv Gandhi with the signing of accord and input suggested that his efforts to bring peace for Sri Lankan Tamils will help him build support among Tamils in Southern India, where the ruling Congress party has been weakest.
Before Rajivs decision, an assessment prepared in June 1984 by the CIA said that New Delhi then rules by Indira Gandhi was preparing for the possibility of direct military intervention. The CIA intelligence memo said Gandhi believes that ethnic violence in Sri Lanka can have serious repercussions for India as well as her own political future.
We believe New Delhis support for Sri Lankas Tamil separatists probably is an effort to control a movement it cannot eradicate. Gandhi cannot move against Sri Lankan Tamils in Tamil Nadu without risking the loss of India Tamil votes in this election year, the CIA memo said.
The intelligence agency said Mrs. Gandhi wants to forestall intervention in Sri Lanka by the superpowers and Indian officials reacted with dismay last summer after hearing of Sri Lankas thinly veiled pleas for security help from several countries including Pakistan, UK and USA. CIA said the Indian Navy can launch a small amphibious assault force against Sri Lanka on short notice.
In our opinion, the likelihood of a peaceful resolution of the tensions that divide Sri Lankan society is rapidly diminishing, the CIA intel note said.
In the war, the ability to see the dust storm even before the engine roars has always been critically important. The CIA memo of December 22, 1987, appears to have had ace up on its sleeve when amid the fog of war it said that Indian forces in Sri Lanka could stay for longer and that could be at least next 3 years.
The CIA said, It is not yet clear how far Gandhi intends to go in establishing dominance over Sri Lanka, but active guerrilla warfare by Tamil fighters against the Indians and over 300 combat fatalities will complicate plans to withdraw and make a long stay more likely; the Indians themselves already are talking of a three year presence. This could presage an extended period of warfare and turmoil.

According to reports, during a public protest at Ihala Madampella in the Divulapitiya Divisional Secretariat against soil excavation, Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake who had arrived at the scene had spoken to the Divulapitiya Divisional Secretary in very harsh language, making malicious allegations accusing her, using his mobile phone and activating the loud speaker system as well.
The Association said the Deputy Minister had undermined the entire public service and demanded that he publicly apologises to the Secretary and would keep away from duty on Monday in case he does not do so. (Tillekaratne Dissanayake)

REUTERS: The Sri Lankan rupee was steady in thin trade yesterday as dollar demand from importers was offset by selling of the US currency by exporters, dealers said, a day after the Central Bank revised the spot reference rate by 10 cents to a record low.
Rupee forwards were active, with two-week forwards trading at 150.90/95 per dollar at 0549 GMT. Two-week forwards closed at 150.90/151.00 on Wednesday.
The spot rupee was quoted around the Central Banks revised reference level of 150.25, dealers said.
There is no big demand and no big supply, a currency dealer said, asking not to be named.
The rupee will be under pressure (to depreciate) as we will be getting seasonal (import) demand in a month or two. There is no reason for it to appreciate unless the country gets a large inflow.
An index tracking the dollar against a basket of major currencies slid to a seven-week low of 99.793 yesterday.

Switzerland ordered to pay 30,000 to deported ex-LTTEr
	
The European Court of Human Rights has ordered Switzerland to pay 30,000 euros as compensation to a Sri Lankan who was deported from Switzerland and subsequently arrested and allegedly beaten in Colombo, The Local reported yesterday.
The unnamed man, a Tamil who had fought with the Tamil Tigers against the Sri Lankan government, requested asylum in Switzerland in 2009, telling the Swiss authorities he had been persecuted in his own country.
The request was rejected and, following an unsuccessful appeal, the man, his wife and children were deported in 2013.
On arrival at Colombo airport they were stopped and questioned, before the man was taken into custody where he was beaten and ill-treated.
He was visited by a representative of the Swiss ambassador who said the man was too frightened to speak freely, found the court.
After that visit the mans wife and children returned to live in Switzerland.
He was finally released in 2015 and requested a Swiss visa on humanitarian grounds, which was accepted by the Swiss migration office.
In its judgement on Thursday, the ECHR decided that Switzerland must have been aware that the man risked persecution when it deported him to Sri Lanka.
The court judged that Switzerland had therefore violated article three of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits torture or degrading treatment and the extradition of a person to a foreign state if they are likely to be subjected to torture there.
Switzerland must now pay the man 30,000 euros in damages and 4,770 euros in costs.

UN torture report a wakeup call to SL Govt.: Sooka
	
A UN report which was published yesterday describing a culture of torture in Sri Lanka is a wakeup call to President Maithripala Sirisenas Government to comply with its obligations under international law and to the international community to put torture prevention at the core of its engagement with the new Government, the International Truth and Justice Project (ITJP) yesterday said.
The UN report by Special Rapporteur Juan Mendez was published yesterday following his mission to Sri Lanka last year as UN Special Rapporteur on torture.
The Special Rapporteur said he received credible reports to show white van abductions have taken place under the Sirisena government in 2015 and 2016.
ITJPs executive director Yasmin Sooka said this devastating report rightly calls for an office which is independent of the Attorney Generals office to investigate and prosecute allegations of torture in Sri Lanka.
We have already offered to assist both the Foreign Minister and the Sri Lankan Human Rights Commission in identifying international experts to help set up such an investigative team. If they are serious about justice this should have been done two years ago, she said.
Ms. Sooka said there has been a deep seated reluctance to accept the evidence on the on-going violations but without security sector reform these sorts of violations will inevitably continue.
Denying the evidence of ongoing abductions because they are politically inconvenient is an unforgivable affront to the scores of victims whose cases have been painstakingly documented by ITJP, our medical colleagues and other human rights groups, she said.
The report says Sri Lankas progress in implementing UN Resolution 30/1 has been slow and transitional justice paralyzed. It stresses the need for a participatory process that earns the trust of victims, including those living outside the country.
The prevention of ongoing abduction, torture and sexual violence  including the rape of young men  must be the focus of the transitional justice process in Sri Lanka. Two years on theres been no structural reform to tackle systemic failures of the justice machinery, said Ms. Sooka.

Unloading of 40,000 diesel barrels suspended
	
The unloading of 40,000 barrels of diesel out of a total consignment of 100,000 barrels imported to Sri Lanka has been suspended after the initial testing revealed that the stock was of low quality, Petroleum Industries Minister Chandima Weerakkody said today.
Our initial testing at sea before pumping the consignment of diesel to the Kolonnawa installation, has found that 40,000 barrels was not up to the accepted standard and samples were sent for further laboratory tests," he said. "We will not hesitate to return the 40,000 barrels of substandard fuel and ask that they be replaced or request for compensation from the supplier."
The minister said there was no issue of quality pertaining to the remaining 60,000 barrels as they had been stored in separate compartments of the oil tanker that arrived from Singapore.
He said the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation kept a watchful eye on the oil tankers that bring fuel to Sri Lanka, as there were instances of sub-standard fuel entering the local market in the recent past, compelling CEYPETCO to pay millions of rupees in compensation to motorists.
We do not need another repetition of the earlier fiasco, the minister said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Wimal taking revenge on me: Prof. Marasinghe alleges
	
UNP National List MP Professor Akshuboda Marasinghe yesterday charged that he was forced to step down from his post at the State Engineering Corporation in 2011 as he refused to approve vehicles being released to close associates of former Housing Minister Wimal Weerawansa.
Professor Marasinghe came out with this allegation while responding to a statement by Joint Opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa who called for his arrest in Parliament on Tuesday. There is no truth in what MP Weerawansa said about me as I never took a single vehicle illegally, the MP added.
Coming up with more allegations about former MP Weerawansa, Professor Marasinghe said that he did not form the National Freedom Front (NFF). He said the party was formed by former MP Nandana Gunatillake and a few others and Weerawansa was invited to take up a position when he was in the political wilderness after defecting from the JVP.
