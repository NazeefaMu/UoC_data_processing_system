Afghan leaders, Taliban attend peace talks
	
?
MOSCOW AFP Nov9, 2018- Moscow on Friday hosted international talks on Afghanistan aimed at kick-starting direct negotiations between Kabul and the Taliban militant group, both of whom sent delegations.? ?
Russia hopes ?through joint efforts to open a new page in the history of Afghanistan,? Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said as the talks opened at a Moscow hotel on Friday morning.? ?
He said that the participation of both Afghan leaders and the Taliban was an ?important contribution? aimed at creating ?favourable conditions for the start of direct talks.? ?I am counting on you holding a serious and constructive conversation that will justify the hopes of the Afghan people,? he said before the talks continued behind closed doors.? Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid told AFP that the militant group was sending five representatives.? ?
They will not hold ?any sort of negotiations? with the delegation of Kabul administration, he said.? ??This conference is not about holding negotiations with any party whatsoever -- rather it is about finding a peaceful solution to the issue of Afghanistan,? he added.? ?This is the first time that a Taliban delegation is taking part in such high-level international meeting, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Thursday.?

Angela Merkel and Theresa May should head for retirement
	
?
Merkel?s big mistake was her leadership during the great economic crisis
?
May voted to stay in the EU but then made a bid for power to become PM by turning her back on her vote, agreeing to take the UK out
?
?
Is Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany, responsible for Brexit? In a way yes, she is because at the time of the great economic crisis of 2007-2013, counter-productively she insisted on austerity throughout the European Union. Austerity helped turn the poorer classes of the UK towards Brexit.?
But so also are the people in high places who lied to the British electorate and persuaded them to vote in a referendum for it. So are those who have fanned the anti-immigrant flames all over Europe. Angela Merkel, in this case, was the most heroic of all the leaders of the West in going the other way and taking in one million, mainly Syrian, refugees. Unfortunately, in the two years before the Brexit vote, she made little effort to support the British Government when it argued that it needed to be allowed to sharply reduce immigration from the EU.?
Yet in 2004 when the EU took in ten mostly central European States, the German Government sought the right to restrict the free movement of labour for a period of up to seven years.?
Then one must add the peculiar dance steps of British Prime Minister Theresa May. She voted to stay in the European Union but then made a bid for power to become Prime Minister by immediately turning her back on her vote, agreeing to take the United Kingdom out. One year later, asked in a radio interview whether she would vote for ?leave? in another referendum, she replied that she didn?t know. This is a devious woman.?
The key issue in the British referendum was immigration. The working class especially feels they?ve taken the brunt of the problems that developed as immigration increased. It?s the working class who overwhelmingly voted for Brexit.?
Unjustifiably, when the British Government approached the EU they were told they had to keep their door open. The UK was one of the only three States that did. Strangely, the UK Government did not fight particularly hard for an exception for itself. Immigrants were pouring in, straining health and educational services, especially in working class areas.?
As ?The Economist? magazine argued last September, other EU members have ?long been amazed that, given Britain?s hostility to immigration, its government either under Theresa May or before under Gordon Brown and Tony Blair, has never applied the constraints allowed on the free movement principle.??
Britain is also a minority in having no registration system for EU migrants. Then it could have, as Belgium has long done, sent migrants back home who do not find a job after six months.?
Most EU countries are tougher than Britain in insisting that welfare benefits cannot be claimed until a migrant builds up some years worth of national insurance contributions (A form of tax to pay for State pensions.)?
Likewise, the EU?s posted-workers directive is used by many countries to try and stop any undercutting of wage and its standards for working conditions.?
Why didn?t the UK follow these compromises? The anti-immigrant vote would not have been so large in the referendum and Brexit would never have happened.?
Mrs. Merkel?s big mistake was her leadership during the great economic crisis. She amplified the economic crisis, which undoubtedly had an impact on the British economy and thus on the referendum vote. What was needed was more public spending not less. This is what Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump have shown, with the result that America has grown nearly twice as fast as Europe during the last decade. As the greatest of all economists, John Maynard Keynes, noted in the 1930s, taxes should be cut during a downturn and raised during an upturn. This works to drive a depressed economy into renewed growth and to save money to pay off debt during an upturn (This is the opposite of what a household should do in straightened circumstances -- which is partly why public opinion doesn?t easily vote for the Keynesian solution unless it is given the quality of leadership that Obama showed.) Angela Merkel behaved like a thrifty housewife.?
She used Germany?s immense economic power to force governments in trouble to slash government spending on pensions, healthcare and education. She insisted that Germany could not help the southern European nations that were in the most serious trouble, arguing that Greeks were lazy and profligate. They were, as were a majority of Italians and Spanish, but as a result the downturn was deepened severely.?
Four European countries bucked the advice, Sweden, Portugal, Slovakia and Poland, and all have done well.?
Europe now finds it self in an historic mess created by Britain and Germany. The EU, created to avoid war again in Europe, has become a seriously divisive issue. It?s ironic and tragic that the two countries that fought hardest in those wars are now responsible for undermining the EU. Theresa May should join Angela Merkel at the retirement door.?

BEST BET STILL MISSED
	
?
Identity politics is perishable. It seems true in Sri? Lanka in particular and in almost all the countries where parliamentary politics prevail. A close perusal of election results including by-elections in the post-independent era of our country drives home the concept that identity politics has done more harm to the nation than good. Now, the time is opportune to make a critical analysis of the tragi-comic status quo political crisis of the nation from a different angle in the context of global politics.? ?
In my view, the Parliament should essentially be a broad church in order to find solutions to our burning issues. There is nothing to hide from the international community. It is crystal clear that almost all party leaders adhered to identity politics to grab the ruling power of the country.?
EDMUND BURKE, the iconic political philosopher, needs no introduction to the students of political science but, to most of the present day politicians. The quotable quotes by this great guru are many. He identifies the political animals in the society divided into little platoons. A profound analysis of this phrase could have meant to refer to the grouping of miscellaneous types of individual voters into clusters glued together for a common goal. They declare that they strive to do good to the whole community.?
I am a freelance journalist. I am a member of the public service retirees? association and an impartial analyst of the current political situations around the world. They are some of the platoons in which I move keeping my head straight.?
In Sri Lanka, the changes of Presidents and Prime Ministers happen in the most unexpected manner. The writer would like to proceed with his argument to make the current Parliament an organisation that would entertain the opinions of all stakeholders with the same weight. In other words, to say NO to IDENTITY POLITICS in capital letters. In this sense, the election of Prime Minister should rest on the parliamentary party. We should not forget the fact that he has to deliver the goods to the nation. The elected members to the Parliament on the party ticket are obliged to respect his or her supremacy for the smooth functioning of the system. The political turncoats become crucial decision-makers or kingpin factors of changing governments under these circumstances. The Westminster system rejects all these undemocratic acts because it vehemently advocates democracy. The flip side of the same coin should display that all the members are equal. As the old adage goes, ?one should not be more equal than others.? The rapport between the Prime Minister and party members is of paramount importance. Thus, there should be a constant dialogue between the Prime Minister and elected parliamentarians because they would tend to think that they would do better than some ministers of the Cabinet. It was very palpable to me many a time and discernible to the public again and again. Mishandling of this situation has proved fatal many a time.?
Ideas and values play a pivotal role in politics in democracies. Only high-calibre politicians with a proven track record would win in this race. Charisma matters a lot in politics. Lack of high presentation has proved detrimental not only in the recent past, but also throughout the political history of our paradise isle. The soul of the political party should be kept untouched for short-term gains. There should be changes of the political journey of a country for a thriving democracy. The so- called JANUARY 8 silent revolution was not result-oriented because the left hand didn?t know what the right hand was doing. The GOOD GOVERNANCE CAULDRON was boiling without the necessary ingredients, even without a drop of beer because of public protest. Burke further adds, ?A State without the means of some change is without the means of conservation.?? The warmth of change was not palpable to the Sri Lankan voter. Now, the Sri Lankan electorate could be optimistic as most of the policymakers and members of the legislature have learnt bitter lessons from the past. To form a profound view of the status quo of Sri? Lanka?s political crisis, a quick assessment of the global political scenario seems to be a guiding light. Failure of most of the political orthodoxies around the world signals us to take a u-turn in policy-making. It is quite evident that most of the political pundits have taken very disastrous decisions in the past without feeling the pulse of the nation. In Mark Twain?s ?PRINCE AND THE PAUPER? most correctly concluded that the boy in mother?s warmth was not her Tom Canty. But our YAHAPALANAYA advocates were not able to deliver the things because they were not able to feel the pulse of the nation. During the last decade, the unbiased intellectuals witnessed many a failure in global politics. The following stand in array would convince you to a great extent. Donald Trump emerged the victor in America, the British voted to leave the European Union, and mishandling of the immigration issue brought adverse consequences to Angela Merkel. Stagnant wages crushed most of the segments of the public. But due to employment generation for political gains and population explosions drastically reduced the unemployment figures in most of the countries. Yet, people everywhere do not seem contented. Some governments printed currency notes as a short-term remedy, but it proved a flop. ?GAMA APITA? slogan of the extremist political parties such as JVP and THE PROGRESSIVE FRONT limited their political campaign targeted at a very narrow strip of voters. Most of the radical left parties still believe they could come to power using university students as their cat?s paw. ?KEPUWATH KOLA OR NIL? has become another failure. Keeping their electorates as home pockets based on the caste system and winning on the religious card do not prove long-lasting.
Some political parties seek winning by assuring the empowerment of the underdog and forget even the electorate after winning. Even the silver tongue of Asia came to power by uniting Sanga, Veda, Guru, Govi and Kamkaru. One time Oxford Union President Caraka laments in his magnum opus writing ?I GO WEST? about the realities of India. To conclude, I vehemently advocate the doing away with IDENTITY POLITICS in Sri Lanka for the good of the nation. The August assembly should essentially be a BROAD CHURCH to realise our cherished dreams; otherwise we will have to bask in the ancient glory without moving a step further.?
In Sri Lanka, the changes of Presidents and Prime Ministers happen in the most unexpected manner. The writer would like to proceed with his argument to make the current Parliament an organisation that would entertain the opinions of all stakeholders with the same weight

Caravan migrants demand buses from Mexico City to US border
	
Central American migrants in a caravan that has stopped in Mexico City demanded buses Thursday to take them to the US border, saying it is too cold and dangerous to continue walking and hitchhiking.? ?
About 200 migrants, representing the roughly 5,000 staying in a stadium in the south of Mexico?s capital, marched to the United Nations office in Mexico City to make the demand for transportation.? ?
The office was closed when the migrants arrived, but a dozen were received by UN representatives at a nearby location, said Ilberto Sosa Montes, a 45-year-old Honduran who is one of caravan?s coordinators.? ?
?We need buses to continue traveling,? said Milton Benitez, a caravan coordinator. Benitez noted that it would be colder in northern Mexico and it wasn?t safe for the migrants to continue along highways, where drug cartels frequently operate.? ?
?This is a humanitarian crisis and they are ignoring it,? Benitez said as the group arrived at the UN office.? ?
The plan was that when the migrant delegation returned to the stadium, roughly a three-hour walk from the UN office, the migrants would gather in an assembly to decide when they would leave Mexico City and what route they would take to the US border.? But the meeting with UN officials was continuing into the evening Thursday, representatives of the UN and the caravan confirmed.? ?
Mexico City authorities say that of the 4,841 registered migrants receiving shelter in a sports complex, 1,726 are under the age of 18, including 310 children under five.? ?

Dream of a just, peaceful and all-inclusive world

Tomorrow is the 100th anniversary of World Armistice Day, commemorating the centenary of the day on which an agreement was signed to end World War I or WWI as we may refer to it in today?s high technology era. Armistice Day is commemorated every year on November 11 to mark the armistice signed between the allies of World War I and Germany. For the cessation of hostilities on the Western Front of World War I, the armistice took effect at 11 o?clock in the morning?the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918.? ?
The day is a national holiday in France, and to mark this centenary year, French President Emmanuel Macron convened a meeting of world leaders. But the United States President Donald Trump -- whose Republican Party was badly defeated in the mid-term elections last Tuesday to the US House of Representatives -- has snubbed the invitation to attend the peace conference.? ?
Many of the invitees, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, Turkey?s Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Germany?s Angela Merkel, are expected to attend the opening of the inaugural Paris Peace Forum, which Mr. Macron will host. Ending uncertainty about whether the US leader would participate, chief organiser Justin Vaisse confirmed to AFP on Thursday that Mr. Trump did not plan to attend.?
In an interview earlier this week, Mr. Vaisse had played down the importance of Mr. Trump?s presence and said the forum was part of Mr. Macron?s efforts to organise a ?fightback? against the threat of rising nationalism. ?The aim of the forum is to show that there are lots of forces in the international system -- States, NGOs, foundations, intellectuals, companies -- which believe we need a world of rules, an open world and a multilateral world,? he said.
?Mr. Macron has been an outspoken critic of Mr. Trump?s ?America First? policies and of his decisions to pull out of international agreements such as the Paris climate accord, the Iran nuclear deal and most recently a nuclear arms treaty.? ?
The British Guardian newspaper says about nine million people were killed in World War I. In an editorial to mark the centenary, the newspaper quotes one of the wars leading historians David Reynolds as saying modern Britain ? and indeed, as we believe most of the modern world ? has ?lost touch? with the first world war and the historical context in which it occurred.?
Our view of the war is now, as he put it recently, a ?tragic-poetic? one, shaped as much by Wilfred Owen and some iconic photographs as by the causes for which the combatants actually fought and the outcomes they would formalise at Versailles. Remembrance has long been extended to take in other conflicts too. Nevertheless, the first war still looms massively in the collective consciousness and in the stories of families. The release recently of Peter Jackson?s remarkable film ?They Shall Not Grow Old? ? it will be screened on BBC2 tomorrow evening ? has helped to make the war freshly vivid for new generations.??
In Sri Lanka, we are still suffering in the aftermath of a 26-year civil war in which hundreds of thousands of people were killed or injured while the devastation caused is incalculable. More than nine years after the end of the war, we are still facing political turmoil with a showdown likely in Parliament next week.?
We hope it will not result in huge street protests or violence because our major religions tell us violence does not cease by violence but by dialogue and accommodation on the middle path.?
As holy scriptures tell us in symbolic terms, dialogue instead of war will lead to a haven of peace where the lion will lie down with the lamb, the wolf will be tamed, the leopard will lie down with the goat, the calf and the lion and the yearling together, and a little child will lead them. The cow will feed with the bear, their young will lie down together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox. The infant will play near the cobra?s den, and the young child will put his or her hand into the viper?s nest. They will neither harm nor destroy anyone.? ?

Even  ?flutterbys? and leeches are not spared
	
?
Let the people decide; not ?Kaluhamis? and ?Kalu Appus?
From Golden-horses to butterflies
?
Political reality does not necessarily reflect popular sovereignty. It is the people who have the final say in State decisions
?
Did President Sirisena, as he once told, risk his life four years ago, but betrayed all the moral values for political expediency when he offered on a platter, the ruling powers to his b?te?noire Mahinda Rajapaksa??
?
Gona? and ?Buruwa? reverberated in the house by the Galle Face in good old days of NM, Colvin, Philip and Sir John, who later shared an erotic anecdote with Marxists at tea. They would not mean it, just the spur of the moment, as there were absolutely no ?animals? in politics then. Do not waste time turning pages of 1950s and ?60s searching for such derogatory terms; even before the expunge order comes from the Speaker, the Hansard reporter had done his part, while the smart lobby journalists who shone with literary quality conveyed it to the reader who had to read between lines. The name ?butterfly? originated from ?flutterby??an insect with colourful wings, a ?FLY? that eats butter.?
?
?ELOWA GIHIN?MELOWA AVA???
Prof. Sarachchandra created the comedy play based on old Sinhala folktale ?Elowa Gihin Melowa Ava? which narrates how a deceitful beggar scrupulously cheated Gamarala?swife ?Kaluhami? who wanted her dead daughter?s jewellery delivered to Elova [world of the dead] through this man when he said, ?Mama Elowa Gihin Melowa Ava,? meaning he just recovered from a terminal illness. In the absence of Gamarala, he collects not only the valuables but steals Kalu Appu?s ?Sudu Assaya? [golden horse?]. Gamarala on his return learns the stupid act of wife, but realise it was too late. He, like all those who voted for ?Hansaya? and ?Pohottuwa? and assembled at Temple Trees and Diyawanna, ?Come Rain or Shine,? finally enjoys the fun dancing and singing a duet proudly claiming;?
?Assayapita nega yanakota dakina dakina aya kiyavi aan yanawa kaluappuge duui kiyala?kalu hamige duui kiala? [People seeing the daughter wearing all the jewellery and riding his horse would say, there goes (he)? Kalu Appuu?s daughter? (she).. Kaluhami?s daughter?] The writer is not comparing the tens of thousands who congregated at the two venues with Kaluhami?s stupidity, but their inherent idiocy.?
This maybe one of the most disgraceful political games ever played and of course played men-of-chance, says anti-Sirisena analysts ? ?Sirisena, Ranil and Mahinda whose only wish is survival at any cost. The present unprecedented occurrence of dethroning PM Wickremesinghe and appointing Rajapaksa brings with it all the rudiments of a ?legitimate coup? swiftly accomplished,? they add, ?it was carefully concealed from the victims to the very second.??
But what most of us fail to understand is that they vigilantly concealed the fact that a precedent was created on November 21, 2014 with that unprecedented crossover, followed by the appointment of opposition leader as Prime Minister, a man who could muster only 46 votes, while the sitting PM had 151 backing him.?
?
LEECHES AND TICKS?
Coming back to flies and leeches; Butterflies are insects in the order lepidoptera. Adults have, often brightly coloured wings, and striking, fluttering flight. It is impolite to use its name to describe lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender humans. Did LGBTQ get it from the first mainstream TV drama named ?Butterfly? or was it the rainbow flag. Story is about a transgender child who wants to transition. All those who jump from one healthy source to the other in search of ?food? are called leeches. Can one leech call another a leech in an offensive manner??
Political reality does not necessarily reflect popular sovereignty. It is the people who have the final say in State decisions.?
?In a free government, the rulers are the servants and the people their superiors and sovereigns,? Benjamin Franklin - A founding father of the United States, author and political theorist.?
Everyone talks about the low depth the Parliamentarians have sunken into but the irony is that the very people cry for re-summoning of the House as a matter of priority? The ?international community? clamour for a decision by Parliament too; they know little about the dismal standard of the 225 clowns, jokers and rogues running it? That is why they attach so much of significance to the ?Den of Thieves? [as it was described by Karl Marx, the 19th century political philosopher]. The appointed MP in the UNP National List, obviously one of Ranil?s loyal and trusted lieutenants, was not only a permanent resident at Temple Trees since October 26 and up to the fourth morning [it was he who had been in charge of organising the continuous Pirith chanting] was enlightened listening to sutras for a week uninterrupted surprisingly abandoned the party and left his boss in the lurch before deserting Temple Trees after a sumptuous lunch [not hoppers] but rushed to President?s office to take oaths in the afternoon as a new government Deputy Minister. Another who took oaths as deputy a few days ago, suddenly realised the value of upholding democratic values and was back at Temple Trees.?
?In the republic of Sri? Lanka, sovereignty is in the people and is inalienable. Sovereignty includes the powers of government, fundamental rights and the franchise? ? Chapter One - Article 3of the Constitution.??
The next or the new government must introduce legislation totally banning crossover: by implementing such rules only we can get rid of a good number of unprincipled, deceitful and roguish elements retuning to the sacred precincts of Diyawanna. Let?s take Parliament back to the ?Galle Face Front? days when it was the most supreme symbol of democracy. This rule can be extended to cover other elected bodies like provincial councils and local government bodies as well.?
?
RULE BY THE PEOPLE?
It should be the ?Rule by the People,? the foundation of all political power associated with political philosophers Thomas Hobbes, a founder of modern political philosophy, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the developer of modern political thought; and John Locke the political philosophers to mention a few. President Maithripala has created the path for MR to come storming back. The country is beleaguered by indecision, a totally chaotic political unrest, economic disaster and enormous fraud at all levels. It is the new government?s duty now to find solutions. It is the people who transfer the authority of a State and its government through the concept of ?sovereignty of the people? or popular sovereignty, the principle sustained by the consent of people who temporarily empower their elected representatives to make decisions and pass laws. The drama played out so fittingly demonstrates, the famous saying, ?in politics there are no permanent friends or permanent enemies, but only permanent interests.? Did President Sirisena, as he once told, risk his life four years ago, but betrayed all the moral values for political expediency when he offered on a platter, the ruling powers to his b?te noire Mahinda Rajapaksa??
His critics also say that four years ago, in one evening in November 2014, he joined his colleagues at Temple Trees for a meal of hoppers and lunumiris hosted by the then all-powerful President, and the very next day appeared in an historical media briefing flanked by a famous political strategist and his former boss and ex-President, to announce his stand.?
?
CREATE MANDATORY CONDITIONS?
Political leaders must take adequate precautions in selecting persons with honesty and integrity, who have proven soundness of ethical principles in conduct and free from moral wrong or fault, are left out of nominated lists. The candidates must be decent, upright, veracious and straightforward. It should be made mandatory that the nominees clear a knowledge-hurdle regarding politics, history, culture and public affairs; and not degrees in rocket science or financial matters. If one would analyse real statistics meticulously, most of the reported heinous crimes against the people and the nation have been committed by the so-called professionals and the ?educated? lot and not by the 123 without A/Levels or 63 minus O/Levels among the present 225 members [Some of them even had acted like jokers or third grade kids!]?
?
ARCHBISHOP?S ADVICE?
The Archbishop Cardinal?s views expressed to the UNP delegation is a good lesson to the UNP leadership. When he asked them why they were reluctant to take this matter to the Supreme Court, the response was ?the anticipated ruling would be against them.??
True people voted Rajapaksas out in 2015, but after three years at the LG elections, this result was reverted. However, as far as the UNP is concerned, the Rajapaksa family has come through the backdoor. Shamelessness is on both sides. What the public don?t understand is that both parties have deceived them and do very little of what they undertook. They must cast their vote to a decent person who can oppose his own party against corruption at a future election which is not very far ? some sections in the society anticipate certain urgent and inevitable consequences in a new Rajapaksa rule. Firstly, will there be the dislodging of ongoing police and judicial processes into numerous irregularities committed during the previous regime? It is unlikely that there will be changes to the Armed Forces, the police and the judiciary, replacing the current holders with their cronies; for they have learnt lessons.?
The writer recollects how the then United States Secretary of State [Foreign Minister] Colin Powell in January 2004 did call on both President Chandrika Kumaratunga and PM Ranil Wickremesinghe to enlighten them on the importance of working together to find a quick resolution to end the Constitutional impasse that existed between the two sides which was similar to the present Constitutional crisis. Two separate letters addressed to the two heads were delivered individually by the then US Ambassador Jeffrey Lunstead. Today, they are taking sides though.?

Govt. won't abrogate S'pore-SL FTA: Bandula
	
International Trade and Investment Promotion Minister Bandula Gunawardana said yesterday the new government did not intend abrogate the much criticized Singapore-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement because it was an international trade pact.
?An FR has been filed against this agreement in the Supreme Court and President Maithripala Sirisena has appointed Prof. W.D. Lakshman to study it and file a report. Therefore, the government would not abrogate the Sri Lanka-Singapore Trade Agreement immediately. Besides, It has been printed only in English and as such we must also print it in Sinhala and Tamil as required by Parliament Standing Orders,? he said
The minister said his prime concern would be to narrow the gap between exports and imports and as such would introduce drastic changes to the trade, investment and monetary policies adopted by the previous government.
?The previous regime followed a policy that ruined the local industry. They were more concerned on attacking political opponents. The abandoning of the ?Port City? project and deserting of many sub contractors led to loose the confidence among investors. The FCID questioned business leaders, chairmen and directors of various companies compelling them to leave the country and that affected the economy badly,? he said.
The minister said he would try to resolve issues pertaining to the economy, investment and trade in a non-vengeful manner.
"The government is confident of a majority in Parliament and has the support of 104 MPs at present, Minister S.B. Dissanayaka said.
He said Mr. Ranil Wickremesinhe's struggle right now was not to secure the premiership but to be the leader of the opposition and leader of the UNP.
The minister said those who left the UPFA camp were in contact with the UPFA leadership to come back and that he was confident that former minister Rishad Bathiudeen would support Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa.
?I believe we can rope in three more UNP members. But some members of our camp do not like them. That is the delay. The UNP right now has only the support of 98 members. The TNA and the JVP would not vote in favour of making Ranil Prime Minister. Anyhow, if the TNA supported Ranil, it will be fragmented into three fractions,? the minister said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Mr. W.S. Hulugalle His integrity and principles were beyond doubt
	
It was with profound Shock and grief that relatives, friends and colleagues received the sad news of the demise of Mr. W.S. Hulugalle of Kurunegala.? ?
He hailed from a very respectable family and was a member of the Sri Lanka Administrative service. He was extremely committed to his official work and well known for ?Paying attention to details.? Having served in almost all key functions of ?Kachcheri? service, he moved to Mahaweli Development project as the Director Administration for Mahaweli Engineering and Construction Agency (MECA) of Mahaweli Authority (MASL). I was privilege to work under his blessed leadership to obtain much valued advice during that period.? ?
Mr. Hulugalle was a man of undoubted integrity and principles. He had a wide circle of friends not only in administrative service but also in the villages in Kurunegala District. His signature in any document signified fairness, justice, logicality and lawfulness of that document which could not be argued or denied by any authority in the administration sector or in the judiciary.? ?
Mr. Hulugalle had a lot of political friends up to the top row of any Government but he was never involved in politics. He leaves behind his beloved wife, Rupa Tennakoon, loving daughter, Sriyani, and only son Laxhman Hulugalle.? ?
?May he attain the supreme bliss of Nibbana. ?? ?

Mrs.Resta Wickremasingha A much loved and respected lady
	
Mrs.Resta Wickremasingha came from an affluent Baptist family from Kerawalapitiya, Hendala, Her parents Mr. & Mrs. Robert de Alwis were blessed with two children, Resta and her brother Leslie.??
I knew her only at the tail end of her life, so whatever I am writing about her is hearsay, and that?s from my husband, for she had moved closely with his parents.??
She was a highly qualified lady in all aspects but she had been a special chosen vessel to do the Lord?s work.? Her preaching had been excellent, although she was not a priest. She had been much loved and respected by all who knew her, she had etched her name in he Baptist world.??
I came to know her only in 1970 and at that time she resided in the Principal?s bungalow at Carey College, Colombo. She was married to the late Dr. W. G. Wickremasingha who was the Principal of the College and also the President of the Baptist Sangamaya.?
They were blessed with three girls. A few years back one of them was taken to her eternal home leaving behind her husband and a young family.??
?From the time my parents retired and came to reside at Hendala and we became members of the Hendala Baptist Church, Mrs. Wickremasingha became a dear friend to our family.??
My husband had the privilege of working with Mrs. Wickremasingha during his young days. He says she was a well disciplined lady. Whether it was collecting funds for the Church or attending to the maintenance of the church, she wanted everything in order and precise. He has shared with me little humorous incidents which had taken place at that time.??
However, much people hadn?t agreed with her, my husband laughs and tells me that at the end of it the work will be done according to her advice. After meeting in the church she would drop in at my husband?s parental home to have a chat with them and share her views.??
It was due to the concern she had for my husband and the concern her close friend and associate the late Mrs. Clarice de Mel had for me that my husband and I are sharing our lives together today.??
I believe that this was the last act of kindness she performed before she was called home by the master at the relatively young age of 51, her death anniversary falls on the 10th of November.??
?Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his faithful servants.??

Prianca Perera Beautiful memories that will remain in our lives
	
The air is cool and crisp, as a sublime breeze blows from the mountainside towards the patio into my room. I think of our dear friend Prianca who suddenly passed away on that Monday night, the first of October.?
The weekend before we had received an e:mail from him, telling us that he would not be able to be with us for Christmas as he was on the threshold of working on a new venture with a friend. When my neighbour from Colombo called us with the news, we were stunned to hear of his sudden passing. It took us a while to comprehend this sad news about our good friend. I had jogged Prianca?s memory, in that? last e:mail to him, I recalled the first time we met him at Calvary Church, with another dear friend Damayanthi Herath, who sadly passed away many years ago in the prime of her life of cancer. Prianca was a solemn greeter in church, impeccably dressed, who took his duty as an usher very dedicatedly. Even though we left Sri Lanka in 2004, we kept in touch via e:mail and phone. Prianca and Manique became very dear to Hillary and me. I think back to the lovely times we spent after church, going to ?Carnival? for ice cream. We enjoyed many dinners and gatherings with our ?Calvary Friends? in our homes. We relished Black cherry cheese cake, that our sister-in-law Mano introduced us to, at the newly opened ?Don Stanleys? at that time.
?
Prianca loved keyboard music. I would plead with him to treat us to a bit of his piano playing occasionally at his home. The trips we did with our group of friends were memorable. It was so much fun
?
We never missed a ?Purple Rain?, or a Philharmonic Pop concert. We listened to lobby music at hotels, just enjoying a fun evening together.
Prianca loved keyboard music. I would plead with him to treat us to a bit of his piano playing occasionally at his home. The trips we did with our group of friends were memorable. It was so much fun. Trips to Welimada, Habarana and World?s end was such a chattering and scintillating experience. I remember most clearly how we ended up at a tourist bungalow in Anuradhapura during one of those suddenly thought of long week end trips. Despite the not so comfortable atmosphere, we enjoyed the loud taped music of the Gypsies, while we laughed at each joke, or some amusing story, while we swatted mosquitoes and ate every morsel of food that was prepared for us. There were many an impromptu trip we did together. The in-depth conversations on social issues, and religion, rationalized explanations that Prianca gave us to clear our minds. Prianca loved God deeply and would not miss hearing His word at any given opportunity. It?s hard to talk about the once so happy times, but our minds are the repositories of all those lovely memories of friends who have left us. They will always be vivid and present in our lives. Prianca was such a caring brother to Manique.? ?
?
?Prianca would remind me to ?be still? and make those two Biblical words my affirmation. To have total reliance in God to see us through this trial
?
In his quiet, unobtrusive way, he did all that he could as a son, and a brother, a giving nephew to his Aunt, and also to any friend who needed his help.?
He, as our friend understood all the upheavals Hillary and I were going through regarding our home in Colombo, the home where we spent many a time of togetherness and joy with our crowd of friends. Prianca would remind me to ?be still? and make those two Biblical words my affirmation.?
To have total reliance in God to see us through this trial. He had a very real and deep faith in God. Prianca?s earthly life has ended. He is now past the moon and the stars. He is with Christ, In Heaven. He is now in the most profound version of home.??
We thank God for the most beautiful memories of our times with you Prianca. All the precious images from the stream of time will remain in the prism of our memory for always.? ?
Goodbye dearest friend. We will surely see you again.? ?

Rohingya ?terrified? about Myanmar repatriation: Aid groups
	
?
YANGON AFP Nov9, 2018- A plan to start repatriating Rohingya Muslims back to Myanmar is premature and the refugees are ?terrified? about leaving Bangladesh where they sought refuge, dozens of aid agencies working in the region said Friday.? ?
More than 720,000 Rohingya Muslims fled Myanmar?s northern Rakhine state to Bangladesh after a heavyhanded army crackdown in August that survivors say involved mass rape and extrajudicial killings.? ?
UN investigators say that the country?s military leaders should be investigated for genocide but Myanmar has rebuffed the calls, arguing it was only defending itself against Rohingya militants who attacked police posts.? ?
Both Bangladesh and Myanmar signed a repatriation agreement to allow Rohingya to return but many fear going back without guarantees of citizenship, freedom of movement and safety.? ?
However the governments said in recent weeks that they were pushing ahead with the first large-scale repatriation in mid-November, prompting an outcry from advocates who say conditions on the ground in Rakhine are not adequate.? ?
?They fled to Bangladesh to seek safety and they are very grateful to the Government of Bangladesh for giving them a safe haven,? the group of 42 aid agencies and civil society said in a statement that referred to the push as ?dangerous.? ?They are terrified about what will happen to them if they are returned to Myanmar now, and distressed by the lack of information they have received.??
