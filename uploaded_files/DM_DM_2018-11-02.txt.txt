A Plea to the  Minister  of Justice by Muslim Women
	
The key issues dealt with were child marriage, womenas Quazi judges and divorce
Womens Association of Sri Lanka Malays (WASLAM) organised a presentation and discussion session on Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act in Colombo on Sunday, October 7th, 2018 in collaboration with Muslim Personal Law Reform Action Group (MPLRAG).

The Nobel Peace Prize 2018 has been awarded to Dr. Dennis Mukwege from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nadia Murad from Iraq, two brave warriors inthe battle against violence perpetratedtowards women.
Against this backdrop it is timely that the Womens Association of Sri Lanka Malays (WASLAM) hosted a discussion on the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act (MMDA) on 7th October, 2018. The Act stems from an archaic piece of legislation borrowed from Batavia (Indonesia) in 1770 AD during the Dutch rule in Sri Lanka and implemented unrevised since 1951 to this day.
In contrast the original law has been subjected to reform and development in its country of origin to suit the changes of time.
The discussion was held in collaboration with the Muslim Personal Law Reform Action Group (MPLRAG), a body of Muslim lawyers and activists earnestly working towards reformation of the Act. Their findings that covered a period of nine (9) years were presented by young female Attorneys; Hyshyama Hamin, Ermiza Tegal, Sabra Zahid and Hasanah Cegu Issadeen. The event was well attended by a large group of women. The dearth of male participation was starkly evident. Only three gentlemen were present with the lionesses in their stronghold.
The key issues dealt with were child marriage, women as Quazi judges and divorce. The objective is to put a halt to girls being forced or coerced into matrimony even at the tender age of fourteen (14) years. An alliance that even older girls would agree to with some trepidation especially since the bridegroom could be 10 to 15 years her senior. Once the alliance is formed this child-bride despite her immaturity, has to fulfil the wishes of her husband and his family. Unable to cope she is compelled to undergo much humiliation, injustice and even violence. Many of these marriages end in divorce if the husband is willing. The child through her parents could appeal for a separation, but the process is long and tedious. Traumatised by her experience the girl becomes socially unfit and is considered a burden by the very people who pummeled her into this horrific situation.
At the divorce proceedings this child faces deep embarrassment by questions of a very personal nature. More so because they are posed by a bench of all-male Quazi judges. Females are woefully excluded. Are Sri Lankan women even the most qualified lawyers, unfit mentally and intellectually to participate in deliberations pertaining to their own gender, begs the question!!! Belonging to the same gender will they not be capable of truly comprehending the feelings and fears of female children If in Indonesia, Malaysia and other Muslim majority countries and in Saudi Arabia females are honoured and respected as Quazi judges, why are Sri Lankan Muslim women treated with such contempt
Fortunately every dark cloud has a silver lining. This visualized in the form of a Commission headed by Justice Saleem Marsoof (PC) to study the MMDA. Its recommendations include: specifying the minimum age of a girl at the time of marriage to be not less than eighteen (18) years and inclusion of women as Quazi judges.
The Commission has encountered some opposition by the All Ceylon Jamiathul Ulema (ACJU) Council, the decision making body pertaining to Islamic matters in Sri Lanka, including the dates of commencement of the Islamic months according to the lunar calendar. Nevertheless, their decisions regarding this particular aspect has caused much confusion among the Muslims. The writer refrains from elaborating as it is irrelevant to the main theme of this article. However, this dissension in the Muslim society has resulted in reluctance by the Government of Sri Lanka to implement the recommendations of the Saleem Marsoof Commission.
Minister of Justice this is over to you.
Please consider the plight of Muslim women in this patriarchal Muslim society in Sri Lanka and grant us redress.

Bribing with public funds!
	

A political bigwig of a major council, whose term has now expired, had distributed the councils left-over funds to minor councils headed by politicos, who had pledged to support him to return to the high office for another term.

The political bigwig had also taken the heads of the fund-recipient  local bodies on a picnic to a holiday resort in the central hills to celebrate the event, they say.
Disburse the monies the way you want and remember to help me at the correct time, had been the provincial bigwigs parting request, they say.
Meanwhile, heads of some local bodies had complained to higher authorities about being denied a share of the councils left-over funds.

Champika continues to work in Megapolis ministry
	
UNP MP Patali Champika Ranawaka in a Facebook post said he had worked at the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry this morning.
MP Karunarathna Paranawithana and several government officials of the Megapolis Ministry joined the UNP MP, who continuously claimed that he was still the Megapolis Minister.
MP Ranawaka stated that notwithstanding what was going on in the country politics wise the projects launched by his Ministry and all the institutions coming under it would be carried without disruption.
In a discussion held with ministry officials he requested their fullest cooperation to see that this becomes a reality.
Despite the present situation in the country I request all State officials to work towards the countrys stability in accordance with the oath of allegiance taken by you. Due to the current crisis in the country several nations have withheld funds due to us. However, we should work as one and overcome this situation, he said.
Meanwhile, MP Ranawaka said that the Japanese Government was schedule to sign an agreement for a project worth over USD 1.4 billion for the proposed metropolitan light railway project this November, but had decided to pull out due to the current political instability in the country.

Constitutional coup and  Rajapaksa politics
	

Pity the nation, whose statesman is a fox, whose philosopher is a juggler,
and whose art is the art of patching and mimicking
 Kahlil Gibran
Pity, it is no doubt. This country, more particularly the urban middle class that now goes berserk calling the removal of Ranil Wickremesinghe from the post of PM as unconstitutional and undemocratic, were the same lot that hailed as democratic the removal of D.M. Jayaratne from Premiership, while he had 151 MPs with him, to install Opposition leader Ranil Wickremesinghe as PM with only 43 MPs.
Whatever the constitutional provision used, no civilised person can justify the removal of a PM with a two-thirds majority in Parliament to bring in ones political ally with a mere 20 per cent of the MPs in Parliament.
And no civilised person could call himself or herself a Democrat supporting this shameless change.
That change was orchestrated, if this country does remember, in the backdrop of an alleged Temple Trees Coup on January 8, 2015, midnight.
President Mahinda Rajapaksa was accused of high treason; conspiring to stay in power despite the Presidential Election defeat. Minister Mangala Samaraweera, in fact, lodged a complaint with the CID.
That allegation was serious enough to immediately arrest the conspirators. Yet, for three years and 10 months, for now, none bothered to ask why was that complaint not investigated
Even Minister Samaraweera, who complained to the CID, never spoke about it, thereafter. Nor did the PM and his closest allies who were made Ministers of Law and Order ever speak about that alleged coup.

"Can I, therefore, propose to have Parliamentary Elections around March 2019"

This time too, ousting of PM Wickremesinghe to install Mahinda as PM, came with a chilling conspiracy.
As told to the nation by President Sirisena, the conspiracy to assassinate him (Gotabhaya too) was what triggered the decision to change the Government.
Massive corruption in the UNP was tagged with it too.
President in his speech did not fail to implicate an unnamed Minister in the alleged assassination plot, which he said, has not been investigated properly.
Changes on both occasions were done with conspiracies given heavy importance. Thereafter, every night for a few days, there are conspiracies spoken about on MPs leasing out allegiances for a few years.
At the time this is written (31 Oct., night) eight UNP Parliamentarians have leased out their allegiance to PM Rajapaksa making his numbers in Parliament just nine less than the required 113 to prove his majority.
It could be, by the time this is published, the job is done with firecrackers and Kiribath.
Or may have a usual Ted Dexter end, ferociously racing up to the 90s but missing the coveted hundred.
Politics is so corrupt and therefore, wholly unpredictable.
This uncertainty has led some Colombo observers to question the political timing of MRs move. They tend to believe, it would have been more prudent for MR to have defeated the upcoming budget for 2019, without getting into this constitutional conflict that tarnishes his popular image.
Internationally, they say, both President Sirisena and MR have now lost all support and IF they cannot muster the minimum required number, they would end up in the dustbin of history.

"Rajapaksa remains the most decisive factor inSri Lankan politics"
That cannot be refuted, nor contradicted when the qualifying phrase IF they cannot muster the required minimum number is written. Yet, that hinges on the question why did MR then decide to fast-forward his entry into State power, before the budget
What needs to be very clearly said at the beginning and with emphasis is, neither of them decides politics on peoples issues and for the people.
All decisions taken are very much on personal interests. During the past decade or two, all who kept leapfrogging from one side to the other have always been voted back to Parliament by the people to sit once again with positions and privileges.
Thus, the political culture of deciding on personal interests to sit with any Government has been nurtured and fostered by this society itself; by the people who elect governments. It is in such a context, that the move by MR has to be politically read, for he remains with both his ears to the ground, more than any other politician today.
He was determined to have Parliamentary Elections ahead of the next Presidential Poll, and as I have written before he was gunning for Parliamentary Elections and nothing else.
The reason was quite plain. He knew quite well that once a person sat as President, he got addicted to the Presidential throne.
He was therefore not prepared to allow anyone else to run for Presidency in his name. His demand lately to have Parliamentary Elections did not provoke a loud campaign for elections, as journalists and the urban middle class read and accepted the constitutional provisions under 19 A, as disallowing Parliamentary Elections for four years and six months.
This constitutional provision was not challenged by Colombo Yahapalana Democrats as suppressing of peoples Sovereignty for 04 years and 06 months.
The constitution nevertheless says, in Chapter I,
3. In the Republic of Sri Lanka sovereignty is in the People and is inalienable. Sovereignty includes the powers of government, fundamental rights and the franchise.
With the dissolution of Parliament denied for 04 years and 06 months, Sovereignty that includes powers of government and the franchise has been made redundant, but accepted as constitutionally valid by the urban middle class who understands and interprets democracy as keeping MR out of political power.
As MR too does not challenge this autocratic, undemocratic provision brought along with 19 A, he himself had to find other means of having Parliamentary elections before the 2020 January Presidential Poll.
The option that was publicly discussed over a month ago, was defeating Mangala Samaraweeras budget for 2019.
For two very sound reasons I believe, he dropped the idea and opted to fast-forward his project to have early Parliamentary Elections by other means.
First is that, as a very seasoned politician who had gone through the political mill with many different fates, his subconscious mind, perhaps told him, collecting adequate numbers to defeat the budget would be a daunting task with Sampanthan, Sumanthiran and most in the TNA voting with the budget, despite its huge allocation for defence.
Two, he knows quite well, this budget is going to be an election budget.
Also, as Mangala is more pragmatic than most others in the UNP, he would use the budget to reach the rural society, the Rajapaksa bastion of electoral power.
There can be numerous projects to pump money into villages, that may leave MR at a disadvantage. Allowing it to go was not to MRs liking. This budget had to be stopped, even if it could be defeated.
There was, therefore, a political gamble MR had to take. The gamble was to stop the budget from being adopted in Parliament and also collect the required two thirds to resolve to have early elections.

"Whatever the constitutional provision used, no civilised person can justify the removal 
Why did MR decide to fast-forward his entry into State power, before the budget "
Thus, his gamble to accept President Sirisenas offer of Premiership, that stunned all, including the UNP leadership and the funded civil society in Colombo.
It proves that State power in hand gives the advantage in collecting numbers than politically appealing for numbers, in our Parliamentary political culture.
It also says, Mahinda Rajapaksa in a way is politically right within our festering political culture, when UNP ministers and MPs meet with Wickremesinghe at Temple Trees, pledged their support to him and then run to Presidential Secretariat to be sworn in as a State Minister or a Deputy.
It also says, political power decides most things, when the State takes dictates from Mahinda as PM, though his appointment is challenged by the displaced Government, restricted to Temple Trees.
Mahindas decision to sit with State Power as PM for his own advantage seems right with no ordinary Sinhala Buddhist folk protesting against his decision.
The question is, what next Perhaps Provincial Council Elections first, as Mahinda Rajapaksa believes he is now riding the political wave high and strong.
He believes he could sweep the PCs as he did the LG Elections. On that strength, he could harvest a two-thirds majority in Parliament to vote for a quick dissolution.
Can I, therefore, propose to have Parliamentary Elections around March 2019
Whether that is accepted or not, Rajapaksa remains the most decisive factor in Sri Lankan politics. Sworn in as PM, promising to have a short-time caretaker Government, he now proves he is the leader the Sinhala South is comfortable with.
And thus I wrote in the opening chapter of the book Rajapaksa the Sinhala Selfie written one year ago in June 2017.
Past midnight on 08 January, Rajapaksa, a man with an ear to the ground, would have known his fate was sealed for the moment. His first public statement after he left Temple Trees and landed in his old ancestral house in Weeraketiya was to the exceptionally large crowd that gathered to welcome him. Still smiling to the cameras he told the cheering and wailing crowd, he still remains the leader of the Sinhala people. He meant he was not going to have the curtain down for long. What makes him so defiant and so certain he could bounce back to politics so soon
This, therefore, is the reason why the lament Not Ranil. Save democracy, with the funded civil society has no real value in Sinhala South.
For, as I concluded the book on Rajapaksa:Reconciliation this new government of Sirisena-Wickremesinghe speaks about is no different to that of Mahinda. The economics of this Government is no different to that of Mahinda both in terms of Chinese dominance and mega corruption..Thus two and a half years without Mahinda remains as much Rajapaksa as it was before.

Current crisis revolves round rule of law: Ranil
	
UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe has said the present crisis is not a matter of personalities, not a matter of political parties but a question on the rule of law.
It is whether we wish to live as a society governed by the rule of law or a society governed by the whims of individuals. This is not an issue which affects the present but one which will affect future generations as well." he has said in his message.
He expressed similar views to University Dons, several public servants and civil society representatives who met him at Temple Trees this morning. They are reported to have told Mr. Wickremesinghe that they would support all moves to safeguard the Constitution and the rule of law. (Yohan Perera)

Dont interfere in SL domestic affairs - GSLF
	
Global Sri Lanka Forum (GSLF), today urged the International community not to interfere in Sri Lankan domestic affairs and condemned the recent statements made by USA, UK and European union as a gross violation of UN resolution A/RES/20/2131 of 21 December 1965 adopted by the General Assembly, which Declared on the Inadmissibility of Intervention in the Domestic Affairs of States and the Protection of Their Independence and Sovereignty.
The resolution categorically condemned that no State has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State, the GSLF said in a statement signed by its President Sunil Chandrakumara.
It also stated;
Consequently, armed intervention and all other forms of interference or attempted threats against the personality of the State or against its political, economic and cultural elements. While foreign countries make statements and deliver speeches directly interfering in internal affairs of the state of Sri Lanka, Ambassadors and High commissioners belongs to above stated countries are seen very active engaging with local politicians advocating to break the law of the land which is far exceeding their diplomatic rights covered under the Vienna convention.
Global Sri Lankan Forum is in the opinion that Diplomats who interfere internal affairs should be declared persona non grata for making disparaging remarks against the Sri Lankan government, interfering with its politics, meddling with its domestic affairs and criticizing its head of state.
Furthermore, GSLF urge all the parties with vest interests to keep away from internal matters related to the people of Sri Lanka emphasizing the fact that Sri Lankans have demonstrated their political maturity and ability to conduct politics in a civil and non-violent means. Even at this major political change, there has being no political violence (even at a level that is comparable to last US presidential election) reported 4 days after the change.
This is a great example that Sri Lanka as a nation very-much capable of handling its internal affairs with no external interventions.

Geopolitical implications of Lankas political crisis
	
Chinas Ambassador Cheng Xueyuan meeting Mahinda Rajapaksa at his Wijerama Mawatha residence in Colombo a day after the latter was sworn in as Prime Minister by President Sirisena.

Sri Lankas democratic process, which suffered a devastating blow last Friday, is likely to be on the reverse gear in the coming months and years. The pre-2015 regime, seems to be moving hell and earth to re-establish itself in power, while the big powers have their eyes fixed on the developments in Sri Lanka.
The constitutional crisis that erupted on Friday night following what is widely seen as President Maithripala Sirisenas controversial and morally unacceptable move to remove the sitting prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, has its geopolitical implications, too.
Although at the centre of this geopolitical aspect of the Sri Lankan crisis are China, India and the United States, the spotlight is largely on China, the only country which permitted its ambassador to meet Mahinda Rajapaksa upon his swearing-in as the prime minister on Friday by President Sirisena. Addressing a protest rally on Tuesday in Colombo, a United National Party lawmaker alleged that Chinese money was propping up the anti-democratic forces and helping them to return to power through the backdoor. A few months ago, a New York Times article claimed that China had lavishly funded Rajapaksas 2015 botched re-election campaign for the presidency.
China has much at stake in Sri Lanka, with Hambantota being the jewel in the crown of the soon-to-become world empire, which is not so nave as to ignore the saying that whoever controls Hambantota, will control the Indian Ocean all the way to Antarctica. Given the propensity for a military confrontation between the United States and China against the backdrop of US apprehensions about Chinas military rise, the trade war between them, the growing tensions in the South China Sea and the security concerns of India, Japan and even Australia, the importance of the Hambantota port has shot up manifold.
When the government changed in January 2015, China had already built part of the Hambantota port for Sri Lanka and an airport in Mattala. The two projects were commercial flops and had negative returns, adding further strain on the countrys growing debt burden. Meanwhile, Chinese companies had penetrated Sri Lankas power, road and building construction sectors and started landfilling for the US$ 1.4 billion Colombo port city where the Chinese developers had been given a 20-hectare plot of Sri Lankas sovereign territory as freehold, with nary a protest from the so-called nationalists or blind patriots.
The port city was a major security concern for India, as the new city developed by the Chinese was adjoining the Colombo harbour, through which 70 percent of Indias shipping cargo passed. Heightening the security concerns of India, the US and Japan were the secret visits of Chinese military submarines to the Colombo port. One such visit took place when Japans Prime Minister was on an official visit to Sri Lanka.
The Rajapaksa regime put all its eggs in Chinas basket and earned the displeasure of India, Sri Lankas closest neighbour, whose cooperation was sine qua non in the quest for a solution to the national question. Yet, India stomached the Rajapaksa governments China-leaning because it felt an all-out hostility would be a worse option. This appears to be Indias policy on the current constitutional imbroglio in Sri Lanka.
The post-2015 Wickremesinghe-Sirisena government took some corrective measures and renegotiated the port city deal. The freehold offer was annulled, but the government, in a desperate bid to tide over the deepening debt crisis, handed over 85 percent of the Hambantota port to China under a joint-venture deal.
Yet, Wickremesinghe performed his balancing act well vis--vis India, China, the US and Japan while the Indian Ocean region was fast becoming a flashpoint for a big power conflict, what with the US and India naming the Indian Ocean region Indo-Pacific and entering into pacts that have made them military allies.
India, Japan, the US and Australia have, meanwhile, intensified military cooperation and are reviving a quadrilateral defence arrangement to counter Chinas military rise and its assertive diplomacy, especially in the South China and Indian Ocean regions. It is against this backdrop that Sri Lanka has plunged into a political crisis with serious international implications. It may not be an unintelligent guess if one were to assume that China precipitated the constitutional coup in a bid to block Wickremesinghes proposal to hand over to India the development of the Colombo Ports Eastern Container Terminal. China was not so pleased when the Wickremesinghe government ditched Chinese companies and handed over to India a mega project to build tens of thousands of houses for the war-affected people in the North.

"The Rajapaksa regime put all its eggs in Chinas basket and earned the displeasure of India, Sri Lankas closest neighbour, whose cooperation was sine qua non in the quest for a solution to the national question. Yet, India stomached the Rajapaksa governments China-leaning because it felt an all-out hostility would be a worse option"
The question that arises is whether the projects earmarked for India, including the ones in the north, the Colombo Ports Eastern Container Terminal project and the project strategic oil tanks in Trincomalee, will now go to China, if the Rajapaksas ensconced themselves in power.
With the bigger focus being the upcoming presidential and parliamentary elections, China may, in a quid-pro-quo deal, waive part of the debt or offer concessions on debt repayment, in the event, Rajapaksa emerges victorious in a floor test in parliament in the days to come. This will enable the Sirisena-Rajapaksa government to take measures to ease the living cost burden of the people and further entrench themselves in the seat of power, notwithstanding the fact that a substantial segment of Sri Lankan society, especially the educated and politically mature people, have condemned their action as undemocratic, unconstitutional and immoral.
Since there is no free lunch in politics, Chinas largesse will come with a must-do list. The Hambantota port may be used by Chinas military vessels on one pretext or another. China may place a request and obtain a tiny island near the Hambantota port on lease. The request had been turned down by the Wickremesinghe government.
Hambantota is a key pivot in Chinas Belt-and-Road initiative, which can certainly contribute to world peace through enhanced and inter-dependent trade. But at the same time the possibility of BRI ports becoming military facilities of China cannot be ruled out, with Chinas yuan diplomacy pushing many developing countries into a debt trap and compelling them to do Chinas bidding.
In this big power game, the leverage India and the US have is limited. They had lost the Maldives and just regained it with the defeat of pro-China President Abdulla Yameen. Even if India and the West add pressure on Sri Lanka through the United Nations Human Rights Council process, the Sirisena-Rajapaksa government can overcome the crisis with Chinas backing. They may warn that Sri Lanka may lose the GSP Plus concessions on account of the countrys poor human rights record and weak democratic credentials. The Rajapaksas have faced this before. But the West and India will not sit idle if, under a Rajapaksa dispensation, the country becomes one with China. Sri Lanka may become a key theatre in the coming world war.
With undemocratic forces gaining upper hand in Sri Lankas political crisis, the bigger danger is the country adopting a Chinese-style virtual one-party political system.

Ill support if UNP wants to defeat Budget: MR
	
Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa said yesterday that one of the main objectives of his Government was to go for General Elections and therefore, he would support the United National Party (UNP) if it wanted to defeat the Vote on Account.
He said going for an election was a must and that defeating a Budget was the easiest way to achieve this.
Defeating a budget or me, whichever means going for a General Election. I look forward to that, he said.
At this moment what we want is an election. If the UNP wants to do that, I support them because we want an election, he told a group of University academics at the Prime Ministers Office in Colombo.
He said the attention of the new Government would be to reduce the tax burden on the public.
When asked about increasing daily wage of estate workers to Rs.1, 000, the Prime Minister said the Cabinet would discuss the issue with all stakeholders and arrive at a solution acceptable to everyone.
At the meeting, the National University Teachers Association presented five proposals including proposals to withdraw the new Constitutional Process, a proposal to take action against bond scam perpetrators and another to nullify the UNHRC Resolution on Sri Lanka.
The academics brought the Prime Ministers attention to issues at Universities and thanked him for action he had taken in the past to develop the University education and the country as a whole.
Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman Professor G.L. Peiris, who accompanied the Premier, said the Government would have regular discussions with all stakeholders in taking decisions and go ahead. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Mr. Bandara said the current situation is that the peoples representatives were bought over for money and added that it was a serious threat to democracy.

Lets be bone conscious
	

An interview with Dr. Benjamin Tow Phak Boon

Weight bearing exercises, such as walking helps stimulate the bones and build the integrity of the bone over time. 15 minutes of exercise daily is adequate to keep the bone stimulated

The skeletal system constitutes an entire framework consisting of bones, joints, cartilages, and ligaments, which serves to provide a well-defined shape for the human body. Apart from structural support, the skeletal system provides protection for visceral organs including the spinal cord, acts as the point of attachment for muscles, facilitates movement, participates in blood cell production, calcium storage and endocrine regulation.
However, the bony framework of the body seldom begets the day-to-day attention it deserves. 
To thrive in life, you need three bones: A wishbone, a backbone and a funny bone ~ Reba McEntire. A healthy backbone, both literally and figuratively, is essential for human beings to stand tall and remain strong. 
Dr. Benjamin Tow Phak Boon, a consultant spine surgeon from Mount Elizabeth Hospital Singapore says, being mindful of your posture is key to maintaining a healthy backbone. In his recent visit to Sri Lanka, facilitated by the Parkway Patient Assistance Center (PPAC) Sri Lanka, in collaboration with Parkway Hospitals Singapore, Dr. Tow, shared his expertise on common orthopaedic issues such as osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, back pain and slip disc. 
Slipped/herniated discs, and osteoarthritis of the spine are what are known as degenerative spine conditions where loss of structure and function occur gradually and is usually caused by ageing. Spinal deformities, limited motion and chronic pain at movement or rest are common signs and symptoms.
Understanding the basic structure of the spine would help identify and prevent habits, which may be leading to gradual spinal degeneration
The spine serves as a pillar to support the bodys weight and to protect the spinal cord. There are three natural curves in the spine that give it its shape These curves help the spine withstand stress by providing a more even distribution of body weight. The spine is made up of vertebrae which are a series of bones that are stacked on top of each other with cushions called intee vertebral discs in between to help absorb shock and load. The inter-vertebral discs are composed of fibrous tissue on the outside and contain jelly-like material on the inside, playing a vital role in shock absorbing. 
Overloading of the spine, caused by bad posture, certain sports, lifting heavy weights and being overweight, lead to gradual tearing of the fibrous tissue and causes disc failiure over time. This is commonly known as slipped disc. The inability of the disc to effectively bear and distribute body weight, results in chronic back pain, especially on prolonged sitting and while changing the posture.
Further, once the fibrous tissue is subject to tearing, the jelly-like material within is pushed out. The protrusion if the disc compresses nerves above or below the disc, thus nerve pain ensues and manifests as thigh and leg pain. If the herniated disc is in the neck, pain can be experienced in the arms, shoulders and shoulder blades.
Good posture distributes the body weight in an even manner and thus the load on the spine is considerably reduced. Practicing a good posture, not only while sitting and standing, but also during lifting heavy objects helps to have a strong spine. Maintaining an ideal body weight is essential for maintaining a healthy back.
Sitting in a place for more than 30 minutes continuously can contribute to the development of back pain, says Dr. Tow. Using electronic gadgets such as laptops and mobile phones over a prolonged period of time makes us assume a position where you are eternally bending forward, and we tend to unconsciously remain in that position for hours. This position places a load on our backs and necks. Dr. Tow advises his patients, especially those who are office employees, to stand up, bend backwards and stretch every 30-40 minutes and to avoid prolonged sitting.
The act of bending forward and twisting your spine, commonly seen in sports that involve high speed and high intensity torque, like golf, tennis, squash, rowing and bowling bears the risk of developing a disc failure over time. However this doesnt brand the sport as risky. Adequate warm-up exercises before playing can considerably reduce adverse outcomes over time.

Osteoporosis
When asked about another prominent bone related disorder osteoporosis, Dr. Tow explained further touching on the pathogenesis of the disease.
Osteoporosis is a condition where the bone density becomes poor due to loss of mineralization of the bone, over time. This leads to weakening of the bone structure, and the bones involved are prone to easy fracture. This condition is asymptomatic and diagnosis is made either through bone density screening or if the patient presents with a fragility fracture. 
Fragility fractures can be the first symptom of osteoporosis. Due to increased bone fragility, patients with osteoporosis suffer fractures even in benign injuries, where under normal circumstances one wouldnt encounter a fracture. The most common bones involved are the wrist, hip and the back bones. 
Dr. Tow advises post menopausal women to take a bone density screening test every 3-4 years, to monitor development of osteoporosis. Women who have had their ovaries surgically removed or have thyroid complications and women who are under steroid medication are particularly at risk for osteoporosis, and they would benefit from bone density screening tests for early detection and prevention of osteoporosis.
In order to prevent development of osteoporosis, perimenopausal (women nearing menopause) women are advised to take calcium supplements on a daily basis, as our daily dietary intake of calcium is usually inconsistent with the calcium requirement of the body. When the calcium requirement of the body is not met adequately, the necessary calcium is taken from the bones, making the bones brittle and fragile over time.

Even though the calcium intake helps prevent the progression of osteoporosis, calcium cannot be adequately absorbed in the absence of vitamin D. Exposure to sunlight, especially the morning stimulates natural production of vitamin D in the body. Those who are not exposed to sunlight may benefit from vitamin D supplements, however vitamin D is usually Incorporated in calcium supplements.

Weight bearing excercises, such as walking helps stimulate the bones and build the integrity of the bone over time.15 minutes of exercise daily is adequate to keep the bone stimulated. Avoiding smoking and consuming food products rich in calcium and vitamin D aids in protection from the development of osteoporosis.

Osteoarthritis
As explained by Dr. Tow, osteoarthritis is a condition arising as a result of wear and tear of the joints. Old age, over usage of joints and daily wear and tear contribute to the development of osteoarthritis. Unlike osteoporosis which is a silent disease, osteoarthritis produces pain and inflammation in the involved joints. 
Osteoarthritis can be prevented from progressing further by reducing the load on the weight bearing joints, by avoiding activities that load the joints and by reducing the body weight. Medications to reduce pain and discomfort can be prescribed and surgeries to lubricate joints are available, to improve quality of life, especially in elders whose function has been compromised due to pain and stiffness. Glucosamine and collagen supplements are believed to be beneficial by some, but there is no strong scientific basis proving their efficacy in prevention of osteoarthritis. However, they may slow down the progression.
Dr. Tow also explained how while some yoga poses are beneficial, some poses involving sitting and hunching forward are not ideal for those who have a weak spine, as it produces a huge frontal load on the back. Advice from a proper yoga instructor rather than self-taught methods can help in avoiding complications over time.
Prevention is the key, and simple measures such as maintaining a good posture can take you a long way, after all, the integrity of the skeletal system is essential both aesthetically and for maintaining a healthy quality of life. 
Dr. Benjamin Tow Phak Boon, MBBs, FRCS, MMed Ortho is a consultant spine surgeon whose focus is on degenerative conditions of the spine, deformity-surgery and minimally invasive spine surgery. He is a fully qualified orthopaedic surgeon and is also well versed in paediatric orthopaedic conditions.

Lion Air  disaster victims found still strapped to their seats
	

Bodies of passengers who died in the Lion Air plane crash have been found still strapped into their seats at the bottom of the ocean.
Indonesian divers revealed they found corpses among twisted hunks of metal and broken pieces of fuselage from the downed jet on the bed of the Java Sea.
Divers told CBS that they have yet to find any large sections of the plane, despite earlier hopes that a 22-meter section had been located on radar.
Search teams did manage to find one black box recorder among the ruins of the Boeing 737 MAX-8, which could solve the mystery of what caused the crash.
Every plane carries two black boxes - so-called despite being painted orange - one of which records voices in the cockpit, the other of which records flight tracking data.
It is not known whether the box recovered was the voice recorder or the much more useful tacker.
On Thursday it was revealed that the fault on the previous flight was so severe that the pilot actually sent out a Pan-Pan distress call - one step down from Mayday - minutes after take-off.
However, a few minutes later the pilot of the doomed jet said the problem had resolved itself and he was happy to carry on to Jakarta.
Just hours later the same jet took off from Jakarta and the situation repeated itself almost exactly, except this time the plane did crash. Indonesia, (Daily Mail), 1 November 2018

Myths and Misconceptions about Kuja Dosha
	
Part 3
We have already explained that the mere placement of Mars in the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 7th, 8th or the 12th House in a Natal Chart does not indicate the presence of Kuja Dosha. It is only a malefic Mars that causes the dreaded Dosha or the blemish and a benefic Mars would produce only good effects. In fact, a person with a benefic Mars in his Natal Chart is an active, energetic and dynamic person equipped with courage, executive skills and a positive outlook.
Mars not malefic when Lagnadhipati or Yogakaraka
For Aries and Scorpio subjects Mars is Lagnadhipati, the lord of the Ascendant. There would be no Kuja Dosha for these two subjects no matter which of the afore mentioned six Houses where Mars is posited.
The same principle is applicable to Cancer, Leo, Sagittarius and Pisces subjects. Because for these subjects Mars becomes a Yogakaraka or a special benefic by the virtue of the fact that Mars rules either a Moolatrikona or both a Kendra (a quadrant) and a Moolatrikona (a main Trine) in case of each of these four subjects.

In the case of the Cancer subject, Mars becomes the lord of the 5th Moolatrikona and the 10th Kendra
	In the case of Leo subject, Mars becomes the lord of 4th Kendra and the 9th Moolatrikona
	In the case of Sagittarius subject, Mars becomes the lord of the 5th Moolatrikona.
	In the case of Pisces subject Mars becomes the lord of the 9th Moolatrikona.
Beneficial yogas
Powerfully placed Lagnadhipati and yogakarakas give rise to beneficial yogas. Therefore, Lagnadhipati and yogakarakas have to be considered special benefics and they cause no harm to the native. The fact that Mars commands aspect over several Houses, namely the 4th, 7th and the 8th Houses in a Natal Chart is a factor that immensely contributes to the phenomenon of Kuja Dosha.
Houses Mars aspects
Now let us consider how Mars influences the Houses he aspects.
When Mars occupies the Lagna or 1st House, he influences the 4th House, 7th House and the 8th House which means what these Houses represent. A malefic Mars in the Lagna can make the native arrogant, aggressive and hot-tempered. The 4th House represents among other things, the mother, mind and family life. And the evil aspect over the 4th House, therefore, can harm the mother, fill the mind with evil thoughts and ruin the family life. Mars again aspects the 7th House which represents the spouse, partnerships and married life. So, he can harm the spouse, ruin the married life and wreck partnerships.
	When Mars is placed in the 2nd House, he can influence the 5th, 8th and the 9th Houses with his aspects. The 2nd House which is also Kutumbhasthana represents among other things, speech and married life. An evil Mars in the 2nd House could make the native harsh in speech and ruin his married life. An evil Mars, as the 5th House represents sons and intelligence, among other things, can harm the children and turns the natives intelligence in an evil direction to make him commit evil deeds. The 8th House represents the life after marriage for a female and an evil Mars aspect over it can ruin a womans married life.
	When Mars is placed in the 4th House he can have full aspect over the 7th, 10th and the 11th Houses. We have already discussed what harm an evil Mars can cause when commanding the power to aspect the 7th House. As for the 10th House it represents ones career or occupation among other things. An evil Mars aspecting this House can ruin the natives career or the occupation. The 11th House is Ayasthana which represents the natives earnings and his friends and social status. An evil Mars commanding aspect over this the 11th House can obstruct ones income sources and turn ones friends into enemies and make the native an unpopular figure in the society.
	When Mars is placed in the 7th House he can command the full aspect over 10th, the 1st and the 2nd Houses. The evil effects Mars can cause when able to influence these Houses have already been explained.
	When Mars is posited in the 8th House, he can fully influence with his aspect the 11th, 2nd and the 3rd Houses. The harm an Evil Mars can cause when he is able to influence 8th, 2nd and the 11th Houses have already been dealt with. About the 3rd House, it is also called Karmasthana. It is a place where Mars can give one success and victory. But an evil Mars aspecting it can cause only defeat and failure.
	The 12th House represents physical pleasure  which most Indian refer to as bed comfort  and an evil Mars occupying this House can deny a couple any physical pleasure in married life. When Mars occupies the 12th House he can aspect the 3rd, 6th and the 7th Houses as well. We have already explained the harm Mars can cause when he can influence the 3rd and the 7th Houses. The 6th House represents disease, debts and enemies among other things. An evil Mars influencing the 6th House can make the native a sickly person, make him fall into debt and give him troubles from enemies.

## Title: November is Lung Cancer awareness month Spread the message before cancer spreads!

November is Lung Cancer awareness month Spread the message before cancer spreads!
	

CANCER, yes, the word sounds heavy just as its real gravity can make a huge impact on an individual. 
As far as this term is described, cancer can initiate at almost anywhere in the human body which comprises trillions of cells. In the normal cell division process, human cells grow and divide to create new cells as per the requirement of the body. When these cells grow older or get damaged, they will die spontaneously after which new cells which are efficient and healthier take over. An individual getting affected by cancer results in the break-down of this orderly process where damaged, aged or abnormal cells will keep on multiplying in a bizarre manner, without letting your body replace them with healthy cells, also invading other parts of the body-making the whole system, disturbed. This situation will give rise to a range of consequences with the worst scenario being death. 
However, the good news is not all these cancer cells are fatal (malignant) and a considerable ratio will in the process become malignant (pre-malignant). In the event there is early diagnosis and treatment there is hope to eliminate the abnormal cells and get your system back to how it was-functioning. 
Every year thousands of people get affected by this so called potential death maker which has a capacity to attack various cells of the body thus making the disease fatal. From the effected parts the lungs have topped the list, over-ruling colon, breast and prostate cancers. November is the lung cancer awareness month, so to shed light on this important topic we present excerpts of a discussion we had with Dr. A. A. Ahamed Riyaaz, MD, FRCP, Consultant Physician. 
Lung cancer is a potentially fatal condition which is known to affect 8-10% of individuals over 60 years of age where smokers have a significantly increased susceptibility over non-smokers. smoking takes its place as one of the most important risk factors says Dr. Riyaaz. 
Other major risk factors for this condition include; passive smoking and exposure to substances like radioactive materials, asbestos, nickel, chromium. A positive family history-in fact a first degree relative having a similar malignancy can increase the risk of you developing lung cancer, but the chances are not that high compared to other factors mentioned before. 

Types of lung cancer
There are 2 types of lung cancer namely, primary lung cancer and secondary lung cancer. 
Primary lung cancer 
This arises from cells in the lung and is further described as two common types called small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). 
NSCLCs include squamous cell cancers-the most common type of lung cancer, adenocarcinoma and large-cell carcinoma. About 1 in 5 cases of lung cancer are SCLC. All these types of lung cancer arise from various cells which line the airways. There are some other rarer types of primary lung cancer which arise from other types of cells in the lung.
Secondary lung cancer 
This occurs when cancer cells from somewhere else in the body get metastasized through blood or lymph and lodge in lung tissues. 
Why it is important to identify what exactly the cancer type is because they have characteristic properties which will help us to determine the treatment modality and prognosis. 
For example, small-cell carcinoma grows and spreads (metastasis) rapidly to other parts of your body and by the time this cancer type is diagnosed, it could have spread all over and might be too late for any medical intervention. In contrast, a squamous cell carcinoma tends to grow more slowly and early diagnosis and treatment would make a remission explains Dr. Riyaaz.

Presentation
It is extremely important to be vigilant and knowledgeable about the ways a person-affected by lung cancer can present and this is what we as health care professionals are mainly trying to focus during November-the month of lung cancer awareness. Despite this wide range of awareness programmes and educational campaigns people tend to ignore-probable symptoms and avoid seeking medical advice. The commonest scenario we get to see is patients coming with a chest X ray taken for some other reason-which usually shows well-established cancer which is too late to be treated or controlled, warns Dr Riyaaz. 
So having an idea about the ways of the commonest presentation would not only help you, but also people around you to not to miss or ignore what needs serious attention. The earliest symptoms of lung cancer can include one or many of the following; Persistent cough, coughing up blood or bloodstained phlegm (sputum), lethargy, malaise and weight loss, shortness of breath or wheezing - especially if a tumor is growing in a main airway and is partially blocking the airflow. 

Hoarse voice 
 A change in shape at the end of your fingers (clubbing which is a clinically helpful sign to make the diagnosis) 
According to Dr. Riyaaz, if the cancer has progressed and metastasized, it will show the same symptoms in more severity with other complaints like recurrent lung infections (pneumonia) not responding to antibiotics, accumulation of fluid in between the lung and chest wall (pleural effusion), bone pain etc. However all these signs and symptoms can be RED flag signs where you need to seek medical care at the
earliest possible. 

Early diagnosis is crucial
A complete history, thorough physical examination and relevant investigations-most importantly a chest X ray and CT scan will lead the way to an accurate diagnosis. Bronchoscopy will also aid in visualizing the air ways and taking biopsies in order to confirm the diagnosis and all these are crucial in initiating the ideal treatment modality which will be further consolidated depending on the rate of progression, growth, severity and extent of spread 

Treatment
Treatment options for lung cancer which include, surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy solely depend on the site of primary tumor in the lung, type of cancer, stage of the cancer (how large the cancer is and whether it has spread) and your general health. 
Your doctor will decide the best treatment option for you considering above factors with the main motive being either complete remission, control of further spread or symptomatic relief. 

Prevention
According to latest research studies, 9 out of 10 lung cancer patients are smokers. Nicotine and tobacco in cigarette smoke are pure carcinogens which directly disrupt your lung tissue thus creating a potential place for cancer cells to grow. So quitting smoking is a MUST if you dont intend to have lung cancer someday in your life and the good news is if you stop smoking for 15 years, the risk of getting a lung cancer reverses to that of a normal person-so its never too late to stop. 
Furthermore, avoiding risk factors, discussed above is also important and applied in your day to day life as prevention is EXTREMELY better than cure-especially when it comes to cancer underscored Dr. Riyaaz. 

Take home message
Lung cancer-if diagnosed at an early stage could be treated more efficiently, but more advanced the disease is, lesser the chance of remission. However, treatment at its earliest has a potential in reducing the progression of the disease, so as the general public it is your duty to be concerned about the prevention of lung cancer by avoiding risk factors and spread awareness on common symptoms and the importance of early diagnosis whenever possible because when it comes to any cancer-every second counts emphasizes Dr. Riyaaz.

I being an Attorney-at-Law who appears on behalf of Animal SOS (ASOS) Lanka before the Court of Law in case of the said matter, its my duty to respond over the false allegations and misrepresentation of the facts made by some state authorities, as published by you in the above event.
Animal SOS Lanka commenced operations in 2009 where there were only a few neighbours in the vicinity and they were invited for the opening ceremony which was attended by the patron of the charity Venerable Athureliya Rathana Thero. So far the charity has rescued thousands of dying stray dogs and cats whilst providing them a shelter till the end of their lives.
In the legal perspective, The Weligama Police has reported facts to the Magistrate of Matara under public nuisance only on 4th December 2014, five years since it commenced operations. The Superintendent of Police Matara inquiring into the matter, called CEA for a report which was submitted on 25th November 2014, recommended several conditions which the Magistrate ordered ASOS to comply with.
On the 2nd of April 2015, The Weligama Police stated before the Magistrates Court of Matara that the respondent alias Animal SOS had managed to comply with the conditions as stipulated by the learned Magistrate on 11th December 2014, as per recent improvements or constructions done thereof.
When the matter was fixed for inquiry, the respondent took it up to the High Court and proceeded onto the court of Appeal, where it has now been fixed for arguments in January 2019.
When the matter was called before the court of Appeal, unfortunately, the so-called complainants/villagers disturbed and interrupted the proceedings of Animal SOS in contrary to the verdict by Magistrate Matara on 2nd April 2015 where they were ordered not to interrupt or to intervene under any circumstance.
The complainants and several other new villagers make serious disturbances threatening life, throwing firecrackers to terrorize the dogs, poisoning sanctuary animals, put up barriers preventing vital supplies to reach the sanctuary and caused criminal damage to property. They harass employees throughout and sabotage proposed renovations. The villagers accuse ASOS for dumping waste water to an outside land regularly and have damaged pipelines causing delays in constructions, which is critical in complying with the regulations of CEA. ASOS were then cleaning several tanks to be utilized for their waste water treatment project by using the pipe line which runs to their own cinnamon land. When it rains the run off matter is collected to the said tanks regularly. To facilitate final arrangements of the waste water treatment plant, it is necessary to clear the tanks to apply a layer of waterproof coating/concrete at the bottom. 

"I represented Animal SOS whilst explaining the real situation of the controversy allowing the officials to understand the ground situation in response to mere allegations made by the villagers"
Though complaints are lodged at Weligama Police and subsequently at Midigama Police quite often, the police have not acted. The so called discussion was represented by Divisional Secretary  Weligama, HQI Weligama (Acting), CEA Southern Province, PHI Weligama and Midigama and some 23 villagers. 
I represented Animal SOS whilst explaining the real situation of the controversy allowing the officials to understand the ground situation in response to mere allegations made by the villagers. The steps taken to improve the conditions and the renovations done with regards to the disposal system, improvements in case of the management of storm water and latest update on the waste water treatment plant thereof, upgrades to parapet wall in minimizing the noise etc. were also explained. These upgrades are done also complying with international standards since most of these works are being designed and supervised by foreign professionals and being funded fully by donors in the UK.
The boundary wall was renovated whilst increasing its height up to 9 feet, areas paved with interlocking blocks,an anaerobic digester unit was installed to collect dog feces and an incinerator to burn solid waste was also constructed costing the charity millions of rupees. The cascade sand filter was also constructed to clean storm water run-off and ASOS has spent LKR 6 Million for their waste water treatment plant, which is in its final phase of implementation. The animal waste collected in the anaerobic digester is taken out by gully browsers regularly,once a week mostly or when full, and every corner of the land is kept in a pleasant manner by the labourers, accordingly. 
The complainants will never understand or accept the effective precautions taken by ASOS and keep lodging complaints at state authorities like Divisional Secretariat, PHI, CEA and the local Police station to simply to make the officials take action against ASOS.
The officials did not speak a word on behalf of the 38 employees, 1400 dogs and 80 cats and the vital service rendered by ASOS providing shelter, rabies control programmes and lifesaving care for so many strays. 
Subsequently when these government officials were interviewed by media they repeated the same allegations made by the villagers.The Divisional Secretary has even stated in the interview with Daily Mirror that ASOS has neither a proper waste disposal system nor a waste water disposal mechanism where ASOS just disposes the waste water to nearby paddy fields and the streams irresponsibly.Surprisingly the Divisional Secretary or any of his officials never visited ASOS. These are only allegations made by villagers and not his own observations, at any cost. 
Finally, all government officials are welcome to see the ground conditions, which is very much different than the verdict of villagers. There is no interruption by ASOS to residents other than conducting English classes for the village kids and the treatments given to their pets and cattle, free of charge.

2,000 Rohingya to arrive in November despite doubts
	

COXS BAZAR AFP Oct31, 2018 -A top Myanmar official said that his country would take back a first group of 2,000 Rohingya refugees from camps in Bangladesh in November despite widespread doubts overthe proposal. 
Officials from the two countries announced on Tuesday that some of the 720,000 Muslim Rohingya who fled a deadly military clampdown in the Buddhist-majority country last year would start returningnext month. 
Myanmar foreign secretary Myint Thu visited the camps in Coxs Bazar on Wednesday to discuss the repatriations with refugees. 
Most repeated demands that they be given Myanmar nationality with full rights before they return. 
Thu said Myanmar has verified 5,000 names on a list of 8,032 Rohingya that Bangladesh authorities sent in February. 
From that 5,000, the first batch will be about 2,000 people. And then a second batch will follow. So in mid-November we will receive the first batch, Thu
told reporters.

She hopes to be somebody again!
	

On hearing about the sudden power change, a fair and lovely one who had lost her Diyawanna status rushed to Colombo in double quick time to felicitate her party leader.

I am so happy, Sir, that I have no words to express my feelings, she told her boss.
However, she could not chat long with the boss as he was at the centre of a flurry of excitement, surrounded by family and party intimates.
Now back in the company of onetime colleagues, the lovely one heaved a long audible sigh of relief and said: Thank God! My troubles are over now!
Asked what she meant by saying that her troubles were over, she explained:
I know that I cant get back to Diyawanna now. But I am sure I will get a good place where I will be somebody again!

The halo slips: What the UNP lost
	


Maithripala Sirisena is a decisionI dont regret.- Ranil Wickremesinghe



I believe thatMr. Wickremesinghe and his group of closest friends, who belonged to a privileged class and did not understand the pulse of the people, conducted themselves as if shaping the future of the country was a fun game.
- Mathripala Sirisena



Political alliances are marriages of convenience. When nothing warrants them, they become a convenient front against a common enemy. But when that common enemy forms an outfit far more popular (that is, outside the parliament) than the coalition and its allies, rifts are bound to materialise. Its not easy to hide those rifts. Sooner or later, they are bound to lead to a collapse. And the more the collapse of these alliances gets delayed, the worse it gets for everyone.
In other words, the UNP and UPFA, by carrying on a premature dalliance for more than three years, screwed the people. There was nothing that called for the coming together of these two traditional foes. It was merely a front against one man. Mahinda Rajapaksa. You can argue that, yes, he was getting it into his head that he was a king (and not the temporary custodian he said he was in 2005) of this country, but even accounting for this, the coalition was a convenient way of battling an inconvenient political future. Inconvenient, that is, to Ranil Wickremesinghe.
When the likes of Ajith Perera and Mangala Samaraweera claim that the people are on their side and that they will somehow prevail, I get amused. The people gaveup this government a long time ago. The people voted for an outfit the UNP and UPFA had excluded from the legislature for more than three years. The people roundly rejected the IMF-driven measures the government was imposing on those who had no access to the car permits or privileges those they had helped bring to power were indulging in. The people were getting tired of the small victories that were being scored and the larger victories that were being evaded.
In other words, the people were showing signs of disenchantment. The government, by trivialising those signs, was being very stupid. And the result of that stupidity was the most unconstitutional coup an opposition could bring about, with the collaboration of the President, in the history of this country.
The Mahinda-Maithripala alliance was promoted by two ideologically different camps driven by one goal: a front against the enemy. Nalin de Silva was in one camp, Dayan Jayatilleka in the other. But given that most of Rajapaksas supporters wanted the man to go alone, such an alliance seemed inconceivable. To put it into perspective, it was much easier to imagine Mahinda and Chandrika in the same room.
And yet, here we are.
Whether it was the best combination, whether it will go up or come down, time will tell. In the meantime, we can confidently say this: that the alliance represents, outside the parameters of constitutional legality and legitimacy, a political expression of the peoples fury against the UNP government. One would have to be a kepuwath kola type or an Old Left apologist to claim otherwise.
How did it come about, though
The UNP-UPFA coalition moved ahead with a programme that was social democratic. It was hard to find out which side of the political spectrum it belonged to, because it belonged to a mishmash of conflicting ideologies, from the Jathika Hela Urumayas sustainability drive to the UNPs pro-business programme. As long as the coalition stuck to its reformist manifesto, however, this didnt matter.
It mattered when the parties tried to translate that manifesto to a meaningful economic programme. To put it briefly, one party had its roots in a populist platform, while the other, despite its championing of a vaguely defined social market economy, had its roots in a compradore, pro-privatisation agenda. It was easy to square the reformist thrust of the political programme with the populist roots of the UPFA. It was harder, though, to square it with the austerity measures the UNP was imposing on the people, ironically in their own name.
The ultimate snub came, for me, when Mangala Samaraweera held a placard bearing an equation that was supposed to be the fuel price formula. No, it was not the equation that infuriated the people. It was the image of Samaraweera and Eran Wickramaratne laughing. With themselves. At a press conference. The symbolism was hard to put off: the political elite, in an air-conditioned room, trivialising a formula that was crushing the people, most of whom had voted for them in 2015. The joke was on those same people. How could you not expect a backlash from them
Theres more.

"When the likes of Ajith Perera and Mangala Samaraweera claim that the people are on their side and that they will somehow prevail, I get amused. The people gave up this government a long time ago. The people voted for an outfit the UNP and UPFA had excluded from the legislature for more than three years"
For decades, the UNP was associated with an anti-rural, anti-Sinhala, anti-Buddhist face. This was known. What was also known, though more recently, was the crass elitism that the UNP kowtowed to, after the 2015 election.
In March 2015 the New York Times ran an article (A Cricket Match with Politics in the Spotlight) that dwelt on the Big Match and its place in a regime dominated by the Prime Ministers Old Boys. The implication was clear: the members of the Club came from more inclusive backgrounds, while the Rajapaksas, who had lost power, came from a background that rejected such inclusiveness. It was a triumph of elitism over ethnicity, underscored by the decision of the Prime Minister to appoint many of the members of the Club to the government. As Gayantha Karunathilaka and Harsha de Silva, quoted in the article, put it, they were bringing the values they had picked up from their school to the country. Rajpal Abeynayake, who criticised the UNP, put this into perspective rather cynically, They are back in charge now. Harsha added, not a little jubilantly, And everyone here [at the Match] is celebrating that.
The UNP came to power in 2015 with a set of beliefs which led them to impose external, ethnic, and security policies that, as Dayan Jayatilleka implied in an article written hours after Sirisena appointed Rajapaksa, affronted the national identity of a majority. It was a set of beliefs cut off from the people. A set of beliefs more at home in Reid Avenue than in Ruwanwella. A set of beliefs rooted in a crass form of elitism, as shown when, for instance, Ranil was praised by his Reid Avenue worshippers for making use of Maithripala (an act that was seen for what it was: a member of the elite enriching himself through an outsider who could never join his ranks). It was, from a sociological perspective at least, fascinating. But also repelling.
I distinctly remember the kind of sentiments harboured by those who affirmed this outlook. It was based on certain crude political differentiations. The Rajapaksas stood for the past, our heritage, the UNP stood for the future, our destiny. The Rajapaksas stood for the old, the UNP stood for the young. The Rajapaksas would take us to the nagula, the UNP would take us to an industrial hub. The Rajapaksas were bumpkins, the UNP were of a more refined order. The Rajapaksas were savages from Beliatta, the UNP were gentlemen from Kurunduwatte.

"Ranil was praised by his Reid Avenue worshippers for making use of Maithripala (an act that was seen for what it was: a member of the elite enriching himself through an outsider who could never join his ranks)"
There was one post in particular that made the rounds on social media. It carried a photo of Ranil and it bore the following caption: I may not carry your baby, but I care more for your childs future than those who can. An entire generation who had grown to admire the man on the basis on his school tie, and elitist credentials, voted for the UNP believing in that message. It was simply too hard to resist.
Where are we now, though Closer to Reid Avenue, yet far, far away from Sri Lanka.
For three years, the UNP spread the myth that only those who came from their class (and schools) could do and deliver. Well, it turned out that they could neither do nor deliver. The beliefs they bandied have, clearly, gone to the dogs. While I do not claim this is the reason behind the indifference of the people towards the perceived illegality of Maithripala Sirisenas appointment of his old foe, I would say that the politics of Reid Avenue, which estranged us all from this government, added fuel to the fury of the common citizen. It has undressed itself, and failed. The people, whom Mangala Samaraweera claims are on their side, have given up on them. And why Because the UNP and those Old Boys have done them all in.

The importance of a second tier leadership - EDITORIAL
	
Sri Lankas citizens are getting a bit jaded now in waiting for that politician with real leadership qualities to emerge and take charge of the nation. Even when there was a tussle for power within the UNP during the time Ranasinghe Premadasa rose in the political ranks, the Green Party had stalwarts in the likes of Lalith Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayake to choose from. If we take a leaf out of that period when the Green Party reigned, we saw that UNP Leader J.R Jayewardene groomed the next generation of politicians to take over the party and also serve the nation.
But that has not been the case with most political parties, except the JVP, since then and we now see many politicians from all walks of life having lofty ambitions which are sadly not supported by their skills.
UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe still feels the need to be in power at age 69. His opponent right now, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, has received another lifeline and is the Premier of the country at the age of 73. The present President of Sri Lanka, Maithripala Sirisena, whose political career is now shrouded in controversy, is 67 years old to date. What do the ages of all these leaders reveal Does the term old is gold apply to politics Some feel these politicians seem to have remained quite long in politics. But others would argue that J.R. Jayewardene became the first Executive President of the country at the age of 72. USA President Donald Trump is 72 and recently Mahathir Mohamad swept to power in Malaysia at the age of 93.
Sri Lanka was suffering for the past three decades in terms of politics largely not due to the actions of corrupt politicians, but more due to the silence of good people. Last Tuesday (October 30) we saw people who love democracy throw their weight behind a protest rally in Colombo, organised to show support for ousted Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe. These people were not necessarily Wickremesinghe fans, but had thought that they should break their silence and voice their protests.
This could be the first step towards demanding that Sri Lanka needs leaders with stature who promote fair play and value democracy. If the platform was set to highlight the unfair treatment meted out to Wickremesinghe, what came out of it instead was a strong reminder being given to politicians that it is high time that they treat the citizenry fairly. One placard that carried the message Im not here for Ranil. Im here for good governance and democracy helps us read the minds of people. Is it a sign that the good people have woken up from slumber
Many who were tired of Sri Lankan politics migrated abroad, more to enjoy a large dose of decency, a fair chance to succeed in life and to see whatever monies they pay as taxes are not misused by the government. Its good if the remaining democratic civil forces in the country can continue with these efforts and force our politicians to value democracy and decency. The civil forces too should be well grounded in the wider society and not at small enclaves. They should also not be funded by external forces with vested interests and agendas. Those who wish to rewind the clock beyond 2015 and boast about development must be told that success without a human touch is not worth highlighting!
We read much in social media about Sri Lanka Pudujana Peramuna loyalists throwing their weight around in government institutes. We experienced Government sponsored strong arm tactics during the Rajapaksa regime and hope such incidents would not occur.
Minister Champika Ranawaka stating that as many as 120 MPs have signed a letter addressed to the Speaker to summon Parliament gives some hope that ousted Premier Wickremesinghe might be in with a chance to prove that he is the one who has the numbers in parliament. On the other hand the Rajapaksa camp has said they have the required numbers. Lets keep our fingers crossed till Parliament meets.

The politics of paradox
	
Tentative notes for the present
The crisis consists precisely in the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot be born; in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear
Antonio Gramsci,from the Prison Notebooks. 
This is a moment for political action and this is a moment for a politics of paradox. 
Is there an old Importantly, is there a new What will the new babe in about 50 years We do not know. 
The new is in the present, and the new is in the future. Our democratic action is about today and is for the future. 
Do we raise our voice against the manipulation of the constitution, the wilful readings and misreadings of it Yes. As Savi Hensman says, when the powerful tear up the rule book, violence against the people is not far off. We need to raise our voice, loud and clear against it, for it suits them to tear it up and that is the impasse of the old, through which fascism slips in. 
We need to rally our forces and form our own voice too, against the rule book at the same time. For we are not scared of Fascism. We will not let it happen. Reactionary forces like the UNP and the coalition and national government will let it happen, pave way for it with their myopic self-interested politics. With neo-liberal trends overrunning the country without any understanding of where we are at the moment, liberal and neo-liberal forces will assume another face. Fascism will walk in, smoothly, with some protest. Let us not let it happen. 
The task ahead: 
Do we support a political party that best represents a peoples voice Yes. 
Do we form independent alliances, and form a collective voice against party loyalties and party politics Yes again. 
The mundane and the immediate:
Do we support the action of reconvening of the Parliament Yes, again, for it is the only representative body we have at the moment. Not heeding it is making way for fascism. 
Do we attend UNP rallies Maybe, yes. Not sure, but will be sympathetic to those who did under the circumstances 
Do we attend JVP rallies Yes, sure, but do so without compromising on peoples demands, policies that do not speak of the minorities, and do not heed democratic practices. 
Do we see JVP as the force to align with Can it be reformed I seriously doubt it, for it is too much turned toward the centre and is fighting for a place in the centre. 
Do we support the TNA No, but appreciate that it did not cross over. 
Do we support the FSP No. It does not offer anything, either at the centre or the periphery, and will not, until it becomes a truly peoples democratic party. 
Do we maintain our critique of these parties and stay outside their platforms and Banners, but support some of the policies Yes, if thats the only way. 
Do we keep aligned to a politics of the marginal, the minorities, the working class, migrant workers, housemaids, plantation workers, the peasants, the fishing people, the landless and the displaced, women, students and youth Yes, for they and we are the people.

Trump administration to reimpose sanctions on Iran
	
The Trump administration is to reinstate all US sanctions on Iran that were removed as part of the 2015 nuclear deal.
However, eight unnamed countries will not be penalised by the US for continuing to import Iranian oil.
President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in May, describing it as "defective at its core".
The agreement saw Iran limit its controversial nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief.
Barack Obama, the US president at the time, had argued the deal would prevent Iran from developing nuclear arms.
The UK, France, Germany, Russia and China were also parties to the 2015 accord and have stuck to it, saying they will set up a new payment system to maintain business with Iran and bypass US sanctions.
Mr Trump argues that the terms of the deal are unacceptable and it has not stopped Iran developing a ballistic missile programme and intervening in neighbouring countries, including Syria and Yemen.
Iran has accused Mr. Trump of waging "psychological warfare". (BBC)

The Government would present a Vote on Account as its second item when Parliament meets, seeking approval to financial allocations to run the country for an interim period, it is learnt.
The leaders of the political parties, aligned with the Government, met with President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday morning and discussed Parliamentary businesses.
President Sirisena is slated to make a statement after the House is convened as the first item.
There will be a debate on it if the opposition asks for it.
Afterwards, the Government will present a Vote on Account as its second item on a later date.
A Vote on Account is presented when the Government wants to allocate money from the Treasury before the annual budget is passed.
The new Government will seek such allocations for the period ending on March 31, 2019. (Kelum Bandara)

Watching the scene from a safe distance!
	

A Blue party organizer in a district north of the sacred city in the hills who is said to be having close ties with the other main party as well had been keeping his mobile phone switched off during the past few days.

Despite being a Blue party organizer, the man is functioning as a key assistant to a former Chief Minister as well, they say.
Finding that the double role that he had been playing is no longer a secret, the politico had decided to go into oblivion at least until he could see a clear picture of the political situation, which is now in the throes of a deepening crisis, informed sources say.

What else could be expected
	

Before Mahinda Rajapaksa was sworn in as the new Prime Minister on Friday evening, did President Maithripala Sirisena sack Ranil Wickremesinghe from the Prime Ministerial post or did the latter cease to hold office following the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) withdrew from the national Government the same evening 
Two versions come from those who endorse the last weeks so-called regime change.
President Sirisena, citing an Article in the Constitution informed Mr Wickremesinghe on Friday night that he had removed the latter from the post. The Chairman of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna and the legal advisor of the Mahinda Rajapaksa group Professor G.L. Peiris also seems to be of the opinion that Wickremesinghe was sacked.
But he always quotes a part of a different Article of the Constitution which says On the Prime Minister ceasing to hold office by death, resignation or otherwise and argues that the word otherwise includes the expulsion of the Prime Minister by the President, despite no provision in the Constitution directly vests power in the President to remove the Prime Minister. No doubt, this is just an interpretation of one side of the debate.
On the other hand, the top aides of Mr Rajapaksa, such as Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammanpila explain the regime change as an inevitable outcome of the withdrawal of the UPFA from the National Government.
They argue that the National Government had been formed by way of the UNP, the party which had obtained the highest number of seats in the Parliament having formed a coalition with the UPFA faction led by the President, and once the UPFA withdrew from the coalition, the National Government ceased to exist.
And they point out another Article of the Constitution which says The Prime Minister shall continue to hold office throughout the period during which the Cabinet of Ministers continues to function to say that Wickremesinghe ceased to hold office once the UPFA withdrew from the national government.
These diverse versions on what happened on the eve of Rajapaksa having been sworn in are an indication that the group endorses the regime change finds grounds to justify the change after it was put into effect.
The ordinary people are utterly confused on the legality and the propriety of what the President has done, in spite of the Constitution becoming a subject matter to be debated in every household these days.
Hundreds of legal interpretations are being put forward every minute on the matter, but pathetically not a single version seems to be independent. Every expert has some sort of link to the parties of the two leaders who are laying claim to the premiership. Sometimes interpretations are based on personal grudges.
Ridiculously some experts interpret the Constitution in one way in the evening but only to switch camp the next morning and unabashedly give a diametrically different interpretation.
Ethics and morality have no place in the current debate. (In fact, it has been so in most of the cases in Sri Lanka) Those who wholeheartedly supported Wickremesinghe when he, with only 47 seats in the Parliament, was sworn in as Prime Minister by President Sirisena on January 9, 2015 question now the morality and the legality of the appointment of Rajapaksa, who had the support of only 95 MPs as Prime Minister by the same President.
Since some might find it hard to digest our point we would put it on the other way round as well.
Those who justify the appointment of Rajapaksa as Prime Minister without the necessary votes in the Parliament today questioned the propriety of appointment of Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister in 2015.
On both occasions those who endorsed the Presidents move to appoint a Prime Minister without the required Parliamentary majority hid behind an Article in the Constitution which says The President shall appoint as Prime Minister the member of Parliament, who, in the Presidents opinion, is most likely to command the confidence of the Parliament.
Yes, for argument sake, he was correct on both occasions. But the whole world knew that even in the Presidents opinion Wickremesinghe in January 2015 and Rajapaksa, at the time of his appointment were not most likely to command the confidence of the Parliament.
During the address to his nation on Sunday, the President admitted that he appointed Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister in January 2015, when the latter commanded the confidence of only 47 out of 225 members of the Parliament. Hence, he admits that he violated the Constitution.
Likewise, it is clear that the President prorogued the Parliament in order for Rajapaksa to muster sufficient support to prove that he commands the confidence of the Parliament.

"Hundreds of legal interpretations are being put forward every minute on the matter
It is a well-known fact that only about 100 MPs, including the four UNP defectors, had set to support Rajapaksa by last Wednesday"
It is a well-known fact that only about 100 MPs, including the four UNP defectors, had set to support Rajapaksa by last Wednesday. The President would be exposed to have violated the Constitution for the second time if Rajapaksa failed to show his majority power in the Parliament once it meets.
Nevertheless, the current scenario is not so surprising, as it is a result of the gradual mounting of conflicts between the President and his coalition partner, the UNP. The conflict came to the surface in the form of Presidents displeasure over the UNP ministers handling of corruption cases against the former regime. It must be recalled that President Sirisena in an unexpected turn of events in October 2016 launched a scathing attack on the Bribery Commission, CID and FCID, claiming that the three institutions had been politicized. Later he and Minister Rajitha Senaratne justified his controversial statement by saying that the three institutions were very slow in looking into the high profile corruption committed by the leaders of the former regime.
The President again in July last year accused the UNP of delaying and even stalling investigations against the leaders of the previous Government. During a Cabinet meeting, he had reportedly challenged to catch the thieves within three months if the police and the Attorney Generals Department were brought under him. He had told the UNP leaders that it wouldnt be a problem for the UNP if Rajapaksa made a comeback. And ironically the situation has come to a head now with the President himself teaming up with the same leaders of the previous regime.
UNP leaders have been questioning since last Friday one of the Presidents famous comments that he would have been six feet under the ground had he been defeated at the last Presidential election. The only answer with which the President can counter their argument is the allegation of a coup to assassinate him and former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, as claimed by Namal Kumara. He could say that going six feet under the ground was not an immediate threat, whereas the coup was already knocking on the door.
In spite of the coup theory having helped the Rajapaksas comeback; and also the purported conspirators having targeted his brother as well, interestingly his group seems to be totally indifferent about it, as the UNP leaders had been. If Rajapaksa proved his majority in the Parliament and the allegation of the purported coup is disproved under the new government what would be the situation of the President
The civil society organizations that helped the President to come to power in 2015 lament that he had betrayed the mandate he received from the people in 2015 by bringing back the regime that he himself called corrupt and dictatorial. True, but it is the so-called Yahapalana regime that betrayed that mandate first by allowing to happen, if not conniving with the Central Bank Bond scam, the largest single financial fraud in Sri Lankas history, as the President had put it in his address to the nation.
Yet, needless to say, people achieved something, in term of democracy during the so-called Yahapalana Government. Not a single state-sponsored abduction was reported during this period and the Right to Information Act had been used even by the Rajapaksa loyalists. Minorities were not in fear. But, the fate of UNP and thereby that of the government seems to have been intrinsic. The UNP which introduced the executive presidency to the country has failed to realize the powers of an executive president. Thus, the same thing happened under President Chandrika Kumaratungas tenure as well, in 2004.
Most important matter to be concerned with all these arguments and bickering is that this is just a dogfight among power-hungry politicians and no interests of the people are involved in it.

When stroke strikes
	

 Stroke is the fourth leading cause of disability in Sri Lanka
 Stroke related deaths are often under-reported
 A rising elderly population inSri Lanka, a cause for concern
 Men are more likely to developa stroke than women
 80% of strokes are preventable 

A healthy blood supply is necessary for organs of the human body to function well. But what happens if the blood supply to the brain is interrupted That is when a stroke occurs, cutting off much needed oxygen and nutrients provided by blood, enabling proper brain function. A stroke is a serious medical emergency, which injures the brain and can leave victims with long-term disabilities.
Dr. Padma Gunaratne, Consultant Neurologist and President Sri Lanka Association of Geriatric Medicine, notes that this disturbance of the blood supply to the human brain often takes place suddenly. Vessels carrying blood to the brain could either suddenly get blocked or they may burst and bleed into the brain. Based on which blood vessel is blocked there will be an area of the brain without blood supply. As different parts of the brain are specialised for varying functions, if the blood supply to any of these areas is disturbed, then the functions of that particular area, which could be speech or vision for instance, will be disrupted. These are the set of symptoms we describe as stroke, Dr. Gunaratne explains.
The disturbance of blood supply could happen due to two reasons. One is when the blood vessel is blocked, resulting in what is known as Ischemic Stroke. The other is when a weakened blood vessel bursts causing bleeding into the brain. This is called the Haemorrhagic Stroke where the area in the brain in which blood occupies gets damaged so that you develop symptoms. In both Ischemic Stroke and Haemorrhagic Stroke you develop symptoms alike.

What is a silent stroke
Symptoms of stroke appear based on the area of the brain which is affected. However in some strokes, the symptoms are almost unnoticeable. For instance, speech is something prominent in humans. In the majority, speech is a domain of the left brain. If your left brain is damaged, then you develop symptoms like weakness and speech disturbance. Strokes in the left brain are therefore more likely to appear with symptoms, Dr. Gunaratne explains.

If you develop symptoms only for a very short period, we identify it as a mini stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack. Nevertheless, this is a retrospective diagnosis. The patient should completely improve for us to identify that the patient had a Transient Ischemic Attack

However according to the expert neurologist, if the right brain is damaged, there are many areas that could be silent. In some cases, a blood vessel in the brain may be blocked but because that area of the brain is not significant or because the affected area is so small, you may not develop symptoms. If a person has had a stroke without causing symptoms, then we call it a silent stroke, she says.
Symptoms
Weakness of one side of the body
	A speech disturbance
	A vision disturbance
	Paralysis of one half of the body: It may be one hand or the face, arm and the leg.
	Severe vertigo or spinning
	Vomiting
	Losing the ability to walk in a straight line
	Some develop sudden and severe headaches: If you have bled severely into the brain, you may develop a sudden, severe headache. This would gradually develop over the next 24 hours and the patient may lose consciousness.
Symptoms of a stroke could appear in two ways. In some, symptoms appear for a very short period (about one hour) before they would settle. If the block is dissolved, the blood supply would be restored. If this happens, Dr. Gunaratne opines that a patient is likely to improve completely. If you develop symptoms only for a very short period, we identify it as a mini stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack. Nevertheless this is a retrospective diagnosis. The patient should completely improve for us to identify that the patient had a Transient Ischemic Attack. The patients likelihood to improve depends on the severity of injury. Patients are at their worst during the peak of the illness within the first few days following the stroke, before they gradually start improving. If symptoms persist for longer than 24 hours, then we identify it as a stroke, Dr. Gunaratne opines.

Is everyone at risk
Some of us are more vulnerable to a stroke, according to the expert. Within the community in Colombo and suburbs, one out of every ten has suffered a stroke. Stroke deaths are under-reported especially from peripheries in Sri Lanka. Hospital deaths indicate that it is the fourth leading cause of disability in the country although in many countries it is the second leading cause of death, Dr. Gunaratne notes. According to Dr. Gunaratne it is likely that Sri Lanka too belongs to the category where stroke related deaths are high, especially because our elderly population is rapidly rising. She warns of a high risk of stroke particularly among the elderly.
Asked of preventive measures to consider, Dr. Gunaratne said that many develop issues due to atherosclerosis which is the thickening of blood vessels. There are many lifestyle interventions that could be implemented to bring down the prevalence of stroke, she adds.
Advanced age, diabetes, high blood pressure, cholesterol, consumption of tobacco and alcohol as well as an unhealthy diet coupled with a lack of exercise are the leading risk factors enabling strokes. Meanwhile Dr. Gunaratne adds, South East Asians are more vulnerable to developing strokes as rates of diabetes and high blood pressure are higher among these groups. Dr. Gunaratne says that patients suffering from heart related ailments are also likely to develop a stroke. We need to consider them as high risk patients and intervene to bring down that risk as much as possible, she warns.
One of the most important preventive measures according to Dr. Gunaratne is to develop the skill of recognising the illness. If you recognise a symptom only, will you be able to act appropriately. If you have recognised it, you need to rush to hospital because there are medicines that could be given to dissolve a clot. By acting promptly you reduce the risk of a person developing another stroke, the neurologist underscores.
Recent figures have revealed another interesting aspect of stroke prevalence in Sri Lanka. According to the stroke registry we have registered more than 1,000 stroke admissions per year at all major hospitals such as the Teaching Hospitals of Colombo, Colombo South, Kandy, Karapitiya and Jaffna. We found that at every age category, more men are admitted to hospitals than women, except in the above 80 category. This is because women live longer than men and therefore the women in this category are more vulnerable to develop stroke, she highlights.
Management of patients
Dr. Gunaratne underscores that the health sector could do more to improve care for stroke patients. 80% of strokes could be prevented. Once they develop a stroke another 70% of them could be very successfully treated. Therefore its very important that people are aware of preventive measures, she says.
Regular assessments for blood pressure, sugar and cholesterol levels along with a healthy diet and exercise would significantly contribute to a healthy lifestyle. Smoking and alcohol consumption should be completley stopped while patients should continue their treatment for existing ailments, especially of the heart, she cautions.
When a stroke occurs, the patient must immediately visit the closest and biggest hospital. For the management of stroke patients need a CT scan. An injection is given to selected patients with blocks in vessels, in order to dissolve the clot. For instance a person in Colombo has to either go to the Sri Jayawardenapura National Hospital or Colombo South Teaching Hospital, because the injection is available in such hospitals only. Furthermore the injection is given only within 4.5 hours from the onset of stroke. It requires extensive investigation and costs the government more than Rs. 100,000. So if you are to receive the injection as well as the highest benefits of these expensive and specific treatments, you have to reach the hospital as early as possible,  she notes. A patient would come to the hospital fast, only if they know to diagnose the clues. If they come beyond this time period, we are unable to give this injection. There has to be knowledge and understanding, Dr. Gunaratne adds.
According to Dr. Gunaratne, stroke patients have to be managed in a stroke unit highlighting the importance of every hospital being equipped with such a unit. All resources should be concentrated to this ward to give the best possible care for patients. A specialised set of nurses, Occupational Therapists, Speech Therapists, Physiotherapists, Social Service Officers allocated from the ministry of social services as well as a counsellor should be working in this ward. Their objective is to cure the patient and where that is not possible to make the patient independent,  Dr. Gunaratne notes.
If you have suffered a stroke or if you are a caregiver for a stroke victim, consider attending the Stroke Support Group Meetings, taking place on the last Saturday of every month at 9 am at the National Epilepsy Centre, NHSL. All patients and caregivers can walk into these meetings where they could receive advise from therapists as well as share the knowledge of other patients who have improved with coping strategies.

Winner of parliamentary majority not our PM: JVP
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said yesterday people should not accept the person who secures a majority in Parliament because it means that peoples representatives were bought over for money to secure the majority.
JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake told a rally in Nugegoda that if the person who secures a majority in Parliament was accepted as the Prime Minister, it means accepting black money. It is black money which decides the position of peoples representatives in Parliament. These transactions are not done through banks. These transactions are concluded using black the money of smugglers, he said.
He said Parliament could not be considered as supreme any longer as peoples representatives were being bought and added that the President prorogued parliament thereby plunging the country into political chaos.
Dinesh Gunawardane, who usually requests that parliament convenes even for a minor flood, is silent over this grave crisis, he said.
Mr. Dissanayake further suggested that people should not accept President Maithripala Sirisena as the President because he betrayed the mandate given to him by the people in 2015. The President has betrayed the mandate of 6.2 million people who voted for him instead of Mahinda Rajapaksa. The President no longer has the support of 6.2 million persons who voted for him or the 5.8 million who voted against him, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
