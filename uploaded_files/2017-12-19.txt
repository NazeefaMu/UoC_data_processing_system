Kenya eyes Russia tea sales on Sri Lanka spat
	
Kenya wants to use the current tea trade spat ? triggered by a single insect? between Russia and Sri-Lanka to boost its volumes to Moscow after years of low exports, the Kenya Daily Nation reported.
Wire agencies reported on Friday that Russia would place temporary restrictions on imports of tea and all other agricultural products from Sri Lanka from Tuesday after a single beetle was found in a consignment.
Tea directorate says it sees the current impasse between the two countries as an opportunity for Kenya to boost sales.
?We see this as an opportunity and a challenge at the same time. An opportunity in the sense that we should use this chance to grow our volumes to Russia and also learn from the misfortune that befell Sri-Lanka to improve our standards,? said the directorate.
The country has over the last one year been working on a strategy to improve the volumes of tea bought by Russia and cut the dominance of Sri Lanka, which is the leading exporter to Moscow.
Kenyan delegation led by Cabinet Secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture will be visiting Moscow in January for the launch of the strategy.
Kenya is, third placed, both in terms of value and volume of tea exports to Russia.
Moscow imports about 13 per cent of the beverage from the Mombasa auction accounting for about 18 million kilos, but the volumes have been dropping in the last three years.
?We are targeting to hit at least 44 million kilos of tea exported to Russia in the next three years mainly looking at increasing quality black tea,? said the directorate.
It has hired Russian consultants to provide intelligence on the profile of a Russian tea consumer and how best Kenya can reach its market.
Kenya has identified and prioritised Russia because it is the leading importer of black tea while it is the leading exporter of the same.
It will be tough for Kenya to win over the Russian market because Sri Lanka ? being the biggest exporter of tea to Russia ? has put in massive resources in the last 20 years to cement its position.

Malaysia to send mission to Jaffna to determine assistance needed
	
Malaysia will send a mission to Jaffna to determine the assistance that can be provided to the war-torn province, Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak said.
The Prime Minister, who received a courtesy call from C.V. Wigneswaran, the Chief Minister of Sri Lanka's Northern Province, said the area, which was home to many Sri Lankan Tamils, had yet to recover from the effects of civil war.
Najib said the people were still suffering as there were 45,000 single mothers who had become their families' sole breadwinners after their husbands died in the war.
In addition, about 11,000 ex-soldiers in Jaffna remain unemployed.
"I told him that Malaysia would send a mission comprising Government officials and the private sector, especially Malaysians from the Sri Lankan diaspora."
"The mission will determine what are the possibilities in terms of the help that we can extend to them," Najib told Malaysian media here before leaving for the Maldives for an official visit.
Najib had been in Sri Lanka since Sunday on a three-day official visit.
The Prime Minister also said that Wigneswaran had informed him that among the areas where assistance was required were for micro financing and public housing. (The Star Online)

Risk management in banks  ? A collaborative function
	
The digital transformation in the banking system in Sri Lanka is fast making inroads to compete with emerging financial intermediaries. The availability of differentiated qualitative services to customers akin to the new-age tech-savvy consumer aspirations is a sign of intense competition. In the process, the efficiency of banks is intertwined with the safety of the digital banking infrastructure.
One of the most important functions of the financial system in any economy is to ensure safety, security and efficiency in the payment and settlement system. The banks in Sri Lanka too have fast geared up to provide adequate digital infrastructure for ensuring an efficient payment and settlement system comparable to the global standards.?
While the banks and regulators are constantly engaged in providing the right digital infrastructure, the surge in the payment network is exposing the system to greater risk linked to technology. In the process of digital emancipation, digital risk is prominently on the radar of banks, which they need to manage on an ongoing basis.?
Risk management is a journey and not a destination, as it keeps unfolding with its own nuances. As a result, the banks have begun to engage cyber space experts to ensure the safety of modes of electronic payment systems. But protection levels have to be well-aligned to surge in usage and growth of the customer base.?
Challenge of scale
With the proliferation of online transactions, torrents of operational data are getting generated exposing the systems to systemic risks. It is vulnerable to intrusions and cyber frauds. The lifestyle changes and banking habits have led to massive increase in the scale of banking operations. Even small payments are routed through the system that adds to the volumes.?
The regulatory objective is to ensure the robustness of the payment and settlement gateways where financial intermediaries are made to follow the standards and specifications in protecting the electronic channels. But risk management, particularly where the customer interface is involved, is not within the purview of banks and regulators alone. They need the well-integrated constructive support of the stakeholders.?
Collaborative function
The risk management in banks in the digital era is turning out to be a collaborative and collective function of all stakeholders. More importantly, the role of banks, government, regulators, vendors, service providers, outsourcing agencies, if any, and customers assumes much more significance. There could be other agencies in the value chain in risk management.?
It requires a whole lot of diligent efforts on the part of banks to impart digital literacy among the users, particularly when financial inclusion is taking banking to the hinterland in a big way. The diversity of the customer base is posing yet another big challenge.?
The cooperation of each stakeholder in shaping the digital ecosystem in banks is important. There has also to be a coordinating link. The regulators play a great role in bringing the stakeholders together in managing risks. A consistent research in identifying the security gaps and pin pointing operational loopholes and sharing the informing on findings can reinforce the risk management system. It is also important to draw the global cue in reinforcing the systemic controls.?
Protection to digital infrastructure
The banks have developed robust protection to the electronic payment system with spill-proof fire walls and appropriate payment authentication systems. Yet, providing safety continues to be important to infuse confidence among the user community. The customers, vendors, merchant establishments and banks have to work together to keep the fraudsters at bay.
The cyberspace is always vulnerable but unless the identity system is compromised, the chances of breach are rare. The customers using the payment network at shops and online payment systems have to be sensitive towards the likely risks. The look-alike websites, technically known as spoofing, have to be cautiously avoided.
The telephonic enquiries of fraudsters posing as bankers asking for details of login ID and password should never be responded. The SMS services now largely provided by Sri Lankan banks should be subscribed even if they are priced.?
Vulnerability to cyber frauds
The regulators always make it clear that the genuine customers will be protected against the loss of funds on account of cyber frauds if the incident is brought to the knowledge of banks well in time. The customers should always check their transactions and remain alert towards the operations reflected in their active accounts. They need to be an aggressive partner in quickly identifying any lapse in cyber security.?
The banking system is susceptible to cyber-crime that encompasses any illegal activity that occurs in the virtual world of cyberspace. Bank branches have to be sensitive towards such weaknesses and make efforts to insulate systems. Internet crime is becoming more common in the banking online space. Unless customer education is imparted constantly, the welfare of users cannot be ensured.?
Risk mitigation strategies
As part of risk mitigation, besides ensuring the safety of the systems and building robustness in systemic controls, data protection is important. Banks globally have the systems of building a disaster recovery site located in a different geography away from central data warehouse to ensure the availability of a fallback mechanism.
Despite the robustness of data protection at the data centre, if for any reason, there is a virus attack or hacking incident, banks should not be exposed to disruption. Banks have to develop robust data back up as a risk mitigation strategy. The offsite data preservation is a common strategy among all financial intermediaries.
Even if there is no adverse incident, banks should run mock system checks by switching over from main data centres to disaster recovery sites once in a while to test its efficacy. It is intended not to compromise the sanctity of data protection at institutional level.?
Risk mitigation ? A cultural shift?
Banks have to forge an alliance with the line management to percolate risk sensitivity to customers at grass root levels and impart awareness to bring a cultural shift towards risk management. Over a period of time, banks should work in a way that all stakeholders aggressively become partners in managing the bank?s digital risk. Soliciting cooperation of stakeholders should be seamlessly integrated with the functioning of the bank.?
An ecosystem has to be created whereby the stakeholders begin to feel the responsibility to manage risk and ward off cyber threats. While protecting the present volumes of data, banks should prepare themselves for future growth in business volumes and data load.?
The greater level of interconnectedness among lines of business requires vigilance against manifestation of digital risk. In the context of the impending shape of technology-led banking system in increasingly dense digital economy, the pillars of stakeholders have to work in unison to keep the customers well-protected from the vagaries of risks.?

Seeking to build two new coal power plants: Cabinet paper differed
	
A joint Cabinet paper submitted by Special Assignments Minister Sarath Amunugama and Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya today seeking approval to construct two coal power plants at Sampur in Trincomalee and Norochcholai in Puttalam had been differed due to the absence of the Finance Minister.
A minister told Daily Mirror that President Maithripala Sirisena is reported to have said the construction of the two coal power plants with an installed capacity of 1,200 MWs needs further evaluation and review by the Finance Minister.
Meanwhile, environment organizations have expressed concern over the proposal to build two new coal power plants in Sampur and Norochcholai despite being rejected by the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) on the basis that they would contribute to environmental pollution harming human, animal and plant life.
The ?Rainforest Protectors of Sri Lanka? Convener Jayantha Wijesinghe referring to this move says the inherent issues and contradictions had cropped up in the recent joint cabinet paper outlining the diversification of the energy mix in Sri Lanka's long-term generation plan (LTGP).
"In line with Government policy, the already approved Long Term Generation Plan (LTGP) for 2017-2038, currently in force cannot be changed until 2019. Should the ministry need to introduce new proposals, it must wait until 2019 to do so, and seek public comments on all such new proposals. The public, being an energy consumer, has a right to comment on the nature of what they are supplied with for consumption; therefore, giving public opinion prior to the tabling of changes is moreover a consumer right," Mr. Wijesinghe said.
?The cabinet paper notes in its 'Background' section that minimizing environmental impacts in the generation of energy is a priority for the country and reiterates that when deciding on the generation mix, protecting the environment is of 'utmost priority'.
As environment organizations, we would like to note that this point is aligned with the assurances Sri Lanka made to the global community as party to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in April 2016, including in the country position paper that, "Sri Lanka will place her development agenda on a fossil fuel free target."
He said the Cabinet paper contradicted its previous point, when it allocates 1,200 MW to be generated by the two new proposed coal power plants, ostensibly for the purpose of strategic diversification of the energy mix to ensure energy security.
"Environmental organizations believe that using strategic diversification as a justification for the development of coal power generation in Sri Lanka is heinously damaging to the country's pledges to the world, and takes Sri Lanka a long step back in a world fast progressing past coal. In fact, the Powering Past Coal Alliance, which is part of the Conference of Parties, aims to grow its country membership to 50 by the next UN Climate Summit in 2018, in recognition of coal's role as the biggest source of carbon emissions in the world," Mr. Wijesinghe said and added that the Cabinet paper uses the term 'clean coal', a misnomer without a scientific definition.
"The term 'clean coal' implies higher technologies in coal processing that removes carbon emissions, although in reality the term is merely subterfuge created and popularized by the coal industry itself, in response to anti-coal litigation." he said. (Sandun A Jayasekara)

Shifting Army HQ from Fort: President blasts MR Govt. decision
	
President Maithripla Sirisena has in a special statement to the Cabinet today blasted the ad-hoc, un-advisable and arbitrary decision by the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime to move the Army Headquarters from Baladaksha Mawatha in Fort and sell the land to Shangri-La Hotel chain.
Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe told a media conference held at the party office that the President had highlighted the fact that this move had placed the country at large and the Colombo City in particular at risk with 15 Army Units being relocated in 15 different buildings at a total annual rental of Rs.5,000 million paid by the Treasury.
He said on a request by the ministers, the President would soon decide whether to appoint a Commission of Inquiry on the questionable transaction where 10 acres of prime land in the centre of Colombo City was sold for a mere US$125 million or Rs.18.80 million and whether to take legal action to get to the bottom of this deal.
The minister said the President had made the special statement as Minister of Defense and pointed out that he was shocked to learn of the damage caused to the country and the economy after perusing the information and the statistics submitted to him by officials on this controversial transaction.
He said the annual rental costing the Treasury a massive Rs.5,000 million a year was the result of a unplanned, foolhardy and ill-advised decision to shift the Army Headquarters.
?There was no plan, no evaluation or no afterthought on the decision to shift the Army Headquarters and the only objective was to permit Hong Kong's Shangri-La Hotel Chain to purchase outright the 10-acre block of land at their price,? the minister said. These are the people who are pointing fingers at the yahapalana government accusing it of selling lands in Hambantota to the Chinese while the fact is that we gave the lands on 99-year lease."
The Cabinet suspended the construction of the Rs.40 billion Defence Headquarters Complex (DHC) at Akuregoda in July this year and the payments to the private contractor stopped on the basis that the selection of consultancy firms and payments had been made without providing correct information to the Cabinet.
The minister said a Cabinet Memo presented by President Sirisena had revealed that a huge financial scam running into billions of rupees had occurred during the initial stages of the project and all Cabinet papers pertaining to the project had been prepared according to the instructions of the former defence secretary.
The disclosure of the financial scam, the haphazard and ad-hoc manner in which the consultancy firm was selected and the payments made was a result of a committee appointed by the Cabinet in March, 2015.
Having considered the note to the Cabinet presented by the Minister of Defence on the ?Project to Construct the Defence Headquarters Complex in Akuregoda?, it was decided by the Cabinet at its meeting on March 18, 2015 to appoint a committee headed by Secretary to the Ministry of Defence to look into this matter and report on matters related to the said project. Accordingly, the report prepared by the committee was presented to the Cabinet on August 5, 2015 by the Minister of Defence.
However, the Cabinet had again decided to request the Secretary to the President to appoint a committee of officials to further inquire into the matters referred to in the first report under Consultancy Firms and Related Payments and observations and recommendations.
Accordingly, the four-member committee has recommended that the Architectural Consultancy Firm named Muditha Jayakody Associates (Pvt.) Ltd.(MJAPL) should not be considered for consultancy services of this project in future.
?There is no doubt that a huge financial fraud has taken place involving this project and the government would go to the bottom of it and expose the culprits and take legal action against them before long," the minister said and added that the ministers commended the President for exposing the scam and requested that it be investigated.

## Title: Vivace  Between the beat and the ensemble
## Section: News Features

Vivace  Between the beat and the ensemble
	
At around 175 beats per minute, vivace brims with vivacity; a tempo that?s at once lively and fast, at once vigorous and energetic. It thrives on ecstasy, on movement, the sort that doesn?t subsist on ensembles but rather on the passionate intensity of the few who take part in it. There?s a thin line between individuality and togetherness, a line which is superfluous if not trivial in large orchestras but one that is significant, to an extent even essential, for the evolution from those orchestras to contemporary music.? ?
On December 23, 2017, at the Nelum Pokuna Theatre, a school of western music society will, for the third consecutive time, take us through that evolution. Before getting to that school and that society though, a few preliminary reflections are called for.? ?
I am at best a spectator and not a connoisseur when it comes to music, Western or Eastern. The only thing I know is that, unlike words and images, tones and rhythms are self-referential and can only be accounted for with reference to their own terms.
Part of the pleasure of listening to a band, an orchestra, a solo artiste, is the rift this opens us to, between the world they inhabit and the larger world they play to. The Western conception of music is largely self-liberating, which at one level adds to that rift: the aesthetics of Western music are predicated on the separation of the artiste from his or her world, a form of separation that entreats us to forget the many other separations we operate on.
Propaganda in music, therefore, is at best inflammatory, unlike propaganda in the cinema or in literature: as Sanchitha Wickremesooriya once informed me, ?For me, music, especially Western music, can be propagandist only if someone is forcing you to listen to a song or a piece by pointing a gun at your head.? Musically we are individualists and pacifists, since we don?t hold guns at each other.? ?
But then there?s a curious contradiction when it comes to Western music in this country. There?s a division between the young and the old, and the young, because they purvey a culture that pits them against the old, get to listen to either the songs of today or the symphonies of yesterday. It?s a strange dichotomy, between Kanye West and Mozart.
What lies between, i.e. the vocalists and the composers and the lyricists who came to us between 19th century Europe and 21st century America, has badly escaped us, if at all because we equate the popular with the individual and the classical with the collective. To get out of this artificial dichotomy, to ensnare oneself from this conundrum, is the correct task of a school or for that matter any institutional society that has at its aim the enrichment of our tastes.
To enrich those tastes, however, one must evolve from the collective to the individual, from the ensemble to the band, because we no longer live in a world of artists who depend on a conductor and a writer: we live in a world of technology, of minimalism, where that artist can be his or her own conductor and writer and even promoter. That is where Vivace comes in.? ?
It all began in 2004 when a Western Music Society was formed at Ananda College, Colombo. Until then two other (broadly defined) music societies operated at Ananda: the Music Circle, a mishmash of the Western and the Eastern which would in later years culminate annually with Rhythm of the Maroons, and the Brass Brand, which would culminate annually with Prashasthi.
The WMS was different in that respect, because while the Music Circle and the Brass Band was premised largely on orchestral performances at large venues, it sought to privilege the individual performance by promoting what was then a late, fresh trend: the emergence of school beat bands which were mobile, didn?t depend on those large venues for their reception by audiences, and didn?t play out with very many instruments. Limited largely to the guitar and the saxophone, the beat band was at its inception minimalistic. That was something that expansive, multifarious orchestra ensembles could never match.? ?
In 2005 the WMS staged its first showcase event, Maroons in Harmony. While ambitious in its scope it was, nevertheless, inhibited by a rather insular outlook, since it was primarily aimed at school members as opposed to general outside audiences.
So it didn?t come to much of a surprise that after 2005 nothing new transpired: the WMS itself was shut down, stunted and dead in all but name, with no other events except for the occasional skit at the occasional concert. While Rhythm of the Maroons, with its oriental background (the Music Circle was historically an offshoot of the school?s first Music Society, inaugurated in 1975 under the guidance of Bandula Kodikara and, later, Lionel Ranwala, exponents respectively of the Indian raag and the jana gee), would begin an year after Maroons in Harmony, and Prashasthi would pick up a while later, the WMS suffered. In silence. That is, until 2014, when the culture of beat bands picked up exponentially and compelled a new show, a new showcase item. Vivace.?
With its first instalment the organisers of Vivace were adamant that it include a special segment for those beat bands. The following year, however, they emphasised even more on that segment by holding a separate competition for beat bands in September, a trend that intensified in 2016 when the number of the bands that participated doubled, from the previous year, from six to 12.
To ascertain the evolution this compelled, I spoke with the current President of the Society, Shamal Dimantha, who was, in those first two years, engaged with his Ordinary Level Exams. To start things off therefore I asked him to comment on how the WMS picked up, with respect to its membership and the responses to Vivace from outside institutions.? ?
The only option we had was to move the Beat Band Competition to December. The problem was that this wasn?t feasible, since not many schools were willing to come forward in a month filled and packed from beginning to end with exams and festivities.
He obliged. ?Firstly, we didn?t have a membership that could help us, as a team, reckon with other clubs and societies. From one batch there would have been no more than 10 or 15 members, a problem that was compounded by the fact that unlike many other societies at Ananda we invite members to join only from Grade 10.
We have for obvious reasons improved now, with an average of 30 per batch joining the Society as members or members of the board. Yes, to be sure we did run into some problems, for the most logistical, in those first few years, with budgets that ran up to five million rupees and with venues that called for even bigger budgets.
But then we moved from Nelum Pokuna to Sugathadasa Stadium in only one year. Naturally that had to do with the responses we got from the schools we invited to perform as beat bands and general audiences.? He then adds (to my dismay) that this Saturday, they will return to Nelum Pokuna, commenting rather wryly, ?We had to face a letdown this time.?? ?
The letdown as such had been the outcome of a general circular issued to government schools prohibiting competitions of any sort being held during the third term. ?The only option we had was to move the Beat Band Competition to December. The problem was that this wasn?t feasible, since not many schools were willing to come forward in a month filled and packed from beginning to end with exams and festivities.
So we downgraded a little this time, with respect to the venue and to the number of the skits that you will see. Instead of the 6 and 12 bands we had in the last two years, you will come across three invited school bands: Lyceum International Nugegoda, D. S. Senanayake College, and Visakha Vidyalaya.? The letdown reflects certain realities that are patently outside the control of the organisers, and hence don?t represent a letdown for the concept behind the show, or for that matter the show itself.? ?
Shamal takes me back to that point I raised earlier, i.e. the way our youngsters and elders have misconceived music as either Mozart or Kanye West, and points out, correctly I believe, that the flowering of a beat band culture in Sri Lanka is an act of demolishing that misconception. ?We basically have missed out on the seventies and the eighties, because we are fixated absolutely on either the classical or the popular.
? What Shamal means there, of course, is that we have broken this entire field between the lavish shows which orchestras deliver and the cheap music videos that ambitious iconoclasts and broken lovers parading as vocalists deliver. Between the two there is a fine line, occupied by those who tilt to neither extreme but borrow from both.
These borrowers are the exponents of school beat bands. I firmly believe that behind their emergence and empowerment lies the emergence and empowerment of a new generation of vocalists and composers, who can?t be considered as cheap and iconoclastic. One can think of Sanuka Wickramasinghe, more than anyone else, here.? ?
Malinda Seneviratne once penned down the following words: ?As people get older their favourite songs get played less and less or else they are forced to listen to stations dedicated to ?oldies? or wait for those special programs where yesterday?s favourites are played.
It is natural for older people to find new music crude. Perhaps it is less a matter of crudeness than something to do with technological revolutions that make for more experimentation and easier broadcast, resulting naturally in cacophony.? Now there?s a difference between cacophony and polyphony, and the organisers behind Vivace, in the Western Music Society at Ananda, would benefit if they realise that difference. Whether they have or not, we will in any case find out. This Saturday.
