Nothing for the govt. servants in the budget: Lal Kantha
	
	The budget presented by the government was the first budget that had provided nothing for the government servants, whereas at least something was granted for them in every budget presented since 2005, former Janatha Vimukti Peramuna (JVP) Provincial Councillor K.D. Lal Kantha said.
	Mr. Lal Kantha was speaking at a cultural event at the Tower Hall in Colombo.
	He said the government had proposed in the budget to remove EPF and ETF from the Treasury and entrust it to another institute by amalgamating them.
	?It is mentioned in the budget that the pension of the government servants was a burden and it should be scrapped for government servants, who would be recruited from 2016 January 01. I do not think the trade unions or government servants took note of it,? he said.
	He said that the government had made several warnings to government and private sector employees in the budget.
	?The government had entrusted the National Trade Union Centre with a big challenge, struggle to safeguard the pension, EPF and ETF, if we could. We will tell Maithri-Ranil Government that we are ready to do so,? he said.
	He said even the government openly said that the State sector was a burden and wanted to cut down its size, while former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had not expressed similar sentiments but increased the State sector. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Opposition cries foul
	
As part of their efforts to engage with the Heads of Diplomatic Missions in Colombo, the joint opposition met the Russian Ambassador yesterday and briefed him about what it called ?the lack of democratic space for dissent and the use of government machinery to suppress political opponents, a former minister said.
The joint opposition, combining a section of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and its allies loyal to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, had also sought appointments with other missions in Colombo.
Former External Affairs Minister Prof. G.L. Peiris, speaking to Daily Mirror, said that the opposition had been denied the opportunity to raise its voice in Parliament in the proper sense. Prof. Peiris said his team wanted to brief the foreign missions on the use of the Financial Crimes Investigation Unit (FCID) to victimize those with apposing political views.
Earlier, he said he was noticed to appear before FCID, within 24 hours after he made critical remarks on the government's plans to release several LTTE suspects and the plan to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act.
Meanwhile, the joint opposition was also seeking an appointment with the Inter Parliamentary Union (IPU), head-quartered in Geneva, to raise these matters with it as well. (KB)

Rejected MPs not appointed to Parliament to help Rajapaksas return: Minister
	
State Minister of Skills Development and Vocational Training Palitha Range Bandara said those who were rejected by the people at the last general election had been taken back to parliament by the President and entrusted with ministerial portfolios not with the intention of bringing the Rajapaksas back to power.
Minister Range Bandara referred to the appointment of Major General Gamini Hettiarachchchi, as the Chairman of the Vocational Training Authority, although he had been in charge of the Special Operations Room operated by retired Army officers during the Presidential Election period and had also worked to prevent Maithripala Sirisena becoming the President on January 8. He asked how this could be construed as Yahapalanaya.
He said this in response to Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe?s statement that officials for the ministry were appointed with the proper approval.
Minister Range Bandara said he had no intention going public with this, but that he had been constrained to do so on account of Mr. Samarasinghe?s remarks.
He said the person appointed to the post of the Chairman of the Skill Development Authority had no knowledge and was unfit to hold such a post. He added that everyone knew he was in charge of the operations unit for the sake of the Rajapaksas.
We should not forget these people worked under Gotabaya to capture power by force or in an unaccepted manner, he said.

	Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said the newly amended Value Added Tax (VAT) system would not be applicable to utilities such as water, electricity and telecommunication.
	He said the consumers would not be liable to pay VAT or any increased charges for those services.
	The 11 per cent VAT has been classified as 12.5 per cent and 8 per cent by the budget with the wholesale and retail trade has been totally exempted from it.
	Repealing the 11 per cent VAT on the wholesale and retail trade should result in the reduction of prices of all commodities in addition to the prices of essential goods reduced by the Budget, the Finance Ministry said.
