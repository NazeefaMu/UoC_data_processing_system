Murali no-balling disrespectful says Waugh
	
Former Australian captain Steven Waugh has said that the no-balling Sri Lankas Muttiah Muralitharan during the famous Boxing Day Test match in MCG back in 1995 was disrespectful and should have been sorted out beforehand.
I just felt it was a bit unfair the way it unfolded. We all knew that Darrell Hair was going to make that call and he made that call on the fact that he believed Murali was bowling illegally. I think it should have been sorted out beforehand in a different way. I just thought he was crucified on the biggest stage of Test cricket. To me it was quite disrespectful to a player, Waugh told cricket.com.au.
Muralitharan later went on to become the highest wicket-taker of Test cricket with 800 scalps.

The meeting would be moved to a future date, he said.
Naseem also noted that Maldivian Ambassador to Sri Lanka Mohamed Hussain Shareefs talk of forcefully bringing Nasheed back to the country encourages violent behaviour.

Where is the VW factory, jobs: Keheliya
	
Former Media Minister during the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime Keheliya Rambukwella today scoffed at the speculations that he was to defect from the Joint Opposition to team up with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) led by President Maithripala Sirisena.
Speaking to the media at his Kundasale residence after a meeting with the candidates of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) contesting the upcoming Local Government elections, Rambukwella said that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was still a State leader for him.
"Mr. Rajapaksa has gone in the history as the king, who saved the country from the clutches of the terrorism. History will attest to the degree of respect the people pay to him," he added.
Observing the situation in the country he stated that the situation on January 8, 2015 no longer existed and the people were waiting to put an end to the current unfortunate political journey of the country.
"You can't hoodwink the people forever. The leaders of the Government said that they would open a Volkswagen car manufacturing plant and create 100,000 jobs. Now where is the car manufacturing plant Where are the jobs" he said.
He said that the SLPP was in a struggling to select candidates for the upcoming elections as 71,000 people were clamouring for slots and that it was with great difficulty that it had selected 8,000. (J.A.L.Jayasinghe)
