Amid divisions with Macron, Trump to travel to Paris to discuss Syria, terrorism
	

REUTERS, 12th JULY, 2017- U.S. President Donald Trump will travel to Paris on Wednesday to meet with French President Emmanuel Macron where the two leaders will seek to work together on Syria and countering terrorism, while avoiding the thorny issues that have divided them.
Trump and Macron -- both political newcomers who scored upset victories in their presidential elections -- have taken very different positions in areas such as climate change and trade.
U.S. and French officials have said Trumps visit to Paris will allow the leaders to focus on those places where their interests overlap, including resolving the conflict in Syria and combating global terrorism.
Macron invited Trump to France to celebrate July 14 Bastille Day festivities and to commemorate the 100 years since U.S. troops entered into World War One.
Its for France a unique opportunity to show French military power ... and thats very important for Trump, said Alexandra de Hoop Scheffer, director of the Paris office of think-tank the German Marshall Fund.

BOC ranked among worlds top 1000 banks again
	
Bank of Ceylon has yet again reaffirmed its position among the top 1000 banks in the world with the country rank No.1 according to the The Banker U.K. Magazine July 2017 issue.
Being the only bank to continuously top the list among Sri Lankan banks, BOC without any doubt can boast of its financial and operational strength which is considered to have accounted for this achievement.
The first and the only Sri Lankan single business entity to earn Profit Before Tax (PBT) of Rs.25.3 billion for 2015 and PBT 31.6 billion for 2016, BOC challenged its own record continuing its quest to strive for exceptional performance in all areas of banking.
BOCs financial KPIs indicate a strong financial performance that has shown steadfast growth since 2015, with ROA standing at 1.9 percent, ROE at 28.3 percent, CAR at 11.6 percent for the year 2016.
For the stipulated year, the bank managed to maintain a 42 percent cost to income ratio portraying its ability to manage cost whilst improving business volumes. Since achieving a Rs.1 trillion asset base in 2012 the bank achieved two more significant milestones recently. Despite many pressures that prevailed due to high interest rates, challenging economic environment and regulatory pressure on capital, the trust and loyalty that was placed on the brand BOC paved way to surpass Rs.1 trillion in deposits in 2015 and Rs. 1 trillion advances in 2016 as the first Sri Lankan bank to do so.
The banks asset value now exceeds Rs. 1.6 trillion and is the highest asset base owned by a single business entity in the country.
Currently the Bank of Ceylon is the only Sri Lankan bank to own a trillion triplet in the balance sheet.
The Banker Magazine UK, is one of the premier banking and finance magazines in the world and has been so since its inception in 1926. The Benchmark top 1000 bank list has been compiled by The Banker since 1970. The Banker database holds comprehensive financial data, news feeds and executive contact data on the leading banks in every country and its ranking sets in the industry standard for measuring bank performance and strength.
Continuing our quest to strive for exceptional performance in all areas of banking, we keep continuing to reach special milestones in the journey, with a steadfast growth.
The Bank moved towards modern state-of-the-art banking and exhibiting exceptional financial performance.
Keeping our momentum of growth in every possible way we have moved up the list and yet again confirm as the countrys No.1within the top 1000 bank ranking, said Chairman of Bank of Ceylon, Presidents Counsel Ronald C. Perera.
We have been always driven by the motive of bringing the best out through every task we carry out as the leading bank in the country. It is my duty to thank my committed staff for all their hard work that was put in to get achievements such as this, said General Manager D.M. Gunasekera.

Brazil's ex-President Lula convicted of corruption
	
Former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has been convicted of corruption charges and sentenced to nine and a half years in prison.
The judge ruled he could remain free pending an appeal.
Lula has rejected claims that he received an apartment as a bribe in a corruption scandal linked to state oil company Petrobras.
He says the trial is politically motivated and has strongly denied any wrongdoing.
The case is the first of five charges against him.
Lula served eight years as president until 2011 and has expressed interest in running again in next year's elections for the left-wing Workers' Party.
On Wednesday, a judge found him guilty of accepting bribes from engineering firm OAS in the form of a beachfront apartment in return for his help in winning contracts with the state oil company.
"For more than three years Lula has been subject to a politically motivated investigation. No credible evidence of guilt has been produced, and overwhelming proof of his innocence blatantly ignored," they wrote.
The head of the Workers' Party, Senator Gleisi Hoffmann, also hit out at the ruling, saying it was designed to stop Lula standing for office.
She said the party would protest against the decision.
The BBC's Katy Watson in Rio says Lula remains a popular politician and the sentence will deeply divide Brazil.
The charges Lula faces relate to the Car Wash scandal, the nickname for Brazil's biggest ever corruption probe.
Operation Car Wash was launched three years ago amid escalating public anger over political corruption.
The investigation centres on firms that were allegedly offered deals with Petrobras in exchange for bribes, which were funnelled into politicians' pockets and party slush funds.
Lula, a former steel worker turned union leader, came to office as the first left-wing leader in Brazil in nearly half a century.
He was Brazil's most popular president during his tenure - former US President Barack Obama labelled him the most popular politician on Earth.
Unable to stand for a third consecutive term, he was succeeded by close ally Dilma Rousseff, who was later impeached.
Current President Michel Temer also faces corruption allegations and is resisting calls for him to step down. (BBC)

Chinese warships conduct live-fire drills in Mediterranean
	

DAILY MAIL, 12th JULY, 2017- In a demonstration of the Chinese navys expanding global reach, the countrys latest-generation warships conducted live-firing drills in the Mediterranean Sea this week while en route to joint exercises with the Russian navy, the defence ministry said Wednesday.
The destroyer Hefei, frigate Yuncheng and support ship Luomahu took part in Mondays drills involving the ships deck guns and small arms, the ministry said in a notice on its website.
Maintaining a strict schedule of targeted exercises accomplishes transit, training and improvement en route, raising the flotillas training levels and capabilities, it quote flotilla commander Liu Hui as saying.
The ships will next take part in the Joint Sea 2017 exercises in waters off the Russian cities of St. Petersburg and Kaliningrad, part of growing cooperation between the countries militaries. Chinas navy is the worlds second-largest behind the U.S. and is increasingly operating in the Mediterranean, aided by the construction of a naval logistics base in the Horn of Africa nation of Djibouti.
Two naval ships departed Tuesday from the southern Chinese port of Zhanjiang with personnel to man the facility, Chinas first overseas military base.
While China says the base is needed to support peacekeeping, anti-piracy and other missions in the region, Beijings rivalry with the U.S. is considered a key driving force behind the countrys military expansion.
The U.S. Navy is also more combat ready because it has been actively participating in joint drills and regional wars for decades, the official China Daily newspaper said in an editorial Wednesday.
This means China has to work harder to become a major naval power that can better defend its territorial rights and sovereignty, it said.

Inspiring awe with a piece of thread!
	

A village boy, who refused to allow a war destroy him, becomes an academic in the field of engineering, winning a global award in the apparel industry

A Sri Lankan boy, born and bred in a war-infested village in the depths of poverty becomes an engineer and goes onto invent a product that can change the future of the world. At first glance the above sentence may look like the blurb taken from the page of a fiction novel, but amazingly, every word is true. 
Rathnayake Mudiyanselage Anura Sarathchandra Rathnayake was born in the remote border village of Nikawewa in the Vavuniya District, at a time when the country was faced with the challenge of battling the LTTE. Nothing about his childhood was normal nor easy.
He grew up accustomed to the sound of mortars being fired in the vicinity throughout the day. During times when most of the world was fast asleep, Anuras family, along with their neighbours frequently spent their nights huddled under a bush in the jungle. They were clutching on to their dear lives.
While other children of his age spent their time in school and playgrounds, Anura, being the eldest of four siblings, scaled trees in the jungle in search of fruits that he sold in the market. He also engaged in heavy work from sowing the fields to reaping the harvest, thus making his contribution to his parents daily efforts to fight poverty. 
Education 
We have heard about people who passed exams studying under the dim lights of kerosene oil lamps. But even the flame of the oil lamp was a luxury for Anura. This was because the smallest light acted as a beacon to the terrorists who raided villages at night, maiming and killing innocent civilians. Even though attending school at this time of his life can be considered a miracle, his former maths teacher fondly recalls that Anura was always a bright and inquisitive student. According to the teacher, Anura had showed potential irrespective of what subject was taught. Not only did he pass the G.C.E Ordinary Level Examination, he took up mathematics at the Advanced Level Examination and qualified to enter the Engineering Faculty of the University of Moratuwa. He was the first person to achieve such a seemingly unthinkable feat in his village. 
Receiving his Bachelors degree in 2002 fueled his ambition to become the best that he could be in his chosen field. He went on to receive a Masters degree from the University of Bolton in 2007. In 2015, he received a Postgraduate Degree related to new researches as well as his Doctorate Degree on new dimension of electronic and smart textiles from Nottingham Trent University in England. 
Global Change Award
Global Change Award is a reputed award presented during a ceremony organized annually by H&M foundation. The objective of the competition is to encourage the introduction of game changing new technologies that are safe, sustainable and to promote the climate positively. Now entitled to use the title Dr to his name, Anura, from the little island of Sri Lanka, found stiff competition from thousands of competitors from 130 countries. Some of them were from industrial giant nations like America, England, Australia and Japan. But the Sri Lankan from the border village again achieved the unthinkable. His concept of content thread was picked among the top three out of more than 3000 concepts presented by the seasoned veterans of the industry. 

Even though attending school at this time of his life can be considered a miracle, his former maths teacher fondly recalls that Anura was always a bright and inquisitive student.

Start of a new era
The textile industry is one of the biggest revenue generating industries in the world, producing approximately eighty billion clothes per year. Unfortunately, only a negligible percentage of this quantum gets recycled, making the textiles industry the second biggest contributor of pollution after oil. The biggest barrier against recycling is the vast range of raw materials used in the industry.
This makes the categorizing of clothes prior to recycling a highly complicated process. The clothes have to be categorized manually and even a single garment of a different ingredient can ruin the whole process, making recycling of clothes an expensive and difficult task. 
As a solution, Dr Anura has brought forward the concept of the content thread. There, a digital tag containing the list of ingredients that supplies the necessary information regarding recycling is given to each garment in the manufacturing stage itself. The tag, an RFIG filament, looks similar to a thread, thereby not affecting the quality of the garment. In addition to carrying information, it will eliminate the need for the time consuming task of manually sorting the garment. This enables thousands of garments to be electronically sorted into separate piles within minutes. This little thread has the potential to revolutionize many other fields like medical, military and naval industries. The judges for the Global Change Award as well as world famous researchers believe that this will be the start of a new era in the Textile and Fashion Designing Industry. 

Felicitation Ceremony
A felicitation Ceremony for Dr. Anura Rathnayake was held on 23rd of June by the group Supporters for new innovators, with the participation of Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka as the Chief Guest. Other distinguished guests included Professor K.K.C.K Perera, Dean of the Morutuwa Engineering Faculty, Mr. Sisira Wijesinghe, Media Advisor to the Sri Lanka Army and Veteran artist Sathischandra Edirisinghe. 
Dr. Anura in his speech stated that the consultations regarding the productions of content thread was being carried out by H & M, the worlds second largest textile manufacturer.
Dr Anura said he is planning to give Sri Lanka the technology and knowledge he acquired abroad while working with the prominent world renowned companies. He also hopes to continue developing his concepts, which is excellent news for those engaged in the Sri Lankan textile industry. 

Philanthropist
From the time he was an engineering student, he has helped students from Welioya realise their goals in education by conducting seminars. He was even nicknamed as Welioya Singhaya by his colleagues in University when he was an undergraduate.
This was because of his determined attempts to broaden the horizons of education and support sisters and brothers from his village. He expanded his services while he was in UK and granted scholarship to children who were selected to universities from the Welioya area. He remembers the numerous generous individuals who supported him while being in university with gratitude. He is determined to give back to the society by helping young students from less affluent families to help them achieve their targets in life. 

The judges for the Global Change Award as well as world famous researchers believe that this will be the start of a new era in the Textile and Fashion Designing Industry.

Imagine a day in the near future where each garment worn around the world-from the President of Unite States to the Queen of England- would carry within it a content thread, the concept of this amazing Sri Lankan who didnt allow being born in a conflict area ruin him. With courage and determination he went on to change the world for good. While his story of courage inspires awe, it also teaches us the very important lesson that if your mind is strong and you believe in your abilities, no barrier can hold you down from realizingyour dream.

Interdicted EPF officer taken to task
	
The Presidential Commission of Inquiry yesterday suddenly summoned CBSL Senior Assistant Director Saman Kumara as a witness while he was recording statements with the CID and the PCoI instructed him to reveal the truth without resorting to contradictions.
He was summoned by the Commission soon after the Pan Asia DGM's cross-examination was adjourned.
Mr. Kumara was the dealer for the EPF in the secondary market transactions with PTL while Pan Asia Bank (PABC) had acted as an intermediary for both due to the regulatory counter party restrictions, according to evidence of PABC DGM.
Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Dappulada Livera initially questioned the witness, Saman Kumara regarding his assets, income and other possessions before the Commission.
While Saman Kumara was testifying, the Commission was repeatedly reprimanded him warning him to reveal the truth because his testimony seemed contradictory with regard to his assets.
Consequent to the series of questions put forward by the Commission and the ASG, the witness revealed about his possessions under his name and those under the names of his wife and his mistress.
It was revealedduring the cross-examination that Mr. Kumara's assests included:
			Three personal vehicles.
				A filling station including two fuel bowsers, which were operated. through the company called Ocmart.
				A Gem Exporting business.
				A company named Country Kitchen.
				A factory named Eco Tex.
				A few properties including fixed deposits.
				19 bank accounts in nine banks.
				Monthly wage of Rs.208,000 at CBSL.
			
		
The ASG said the witness seemed a downright liar, as his answers to the commission were incompatible.

However, after obtaining permission from the commission, the witness made an explanation regarding the issue.
The witness was of the view that there is a conspiracy going on against him at the Central Bank in a malicious manner accusing him for the incident.
He said he was an employee of the CBSL having an intention of creating better market transactions.
I was in favour of the 'Auction only system in Treasury Bond transactions, and I liked former Governor Arjun Mahendran coming in because he was a good worker in the fund management field in Singapore and he was also in favour of having an auction only system, he said.
When questioned by the ASG it was revealed that the witness and two other CBSL officials had met a relevant Minister immediately after the Bond auction held on February 27, 2015 on the instructions of the former Governor, to provide information to the minister regarding the recent bond auction.
Considering the statement of the witness, the Commission advised him not to fear anything and expose everything that he knows about the incident and the people who instructed him.
We want to reveal the truth, so we expect you would support us by revealing everything you know,' SC Justice Prasanna Jayawardena said.
The Commission also directed him to hand over his passport and previous mobile devise to the prosecution to examine further into the witness. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

JO against latest supplementary estimate
	
The joint opposition said it was completely against the supplementary estimate presented to Parliament seeking approval to allocate Rs. 148.8 million to purchase vehicles for several ministers.
The Government presented the supplementary estimate on July 7 seeking funds for the purchase of vehicles for the Postal Services and Muslim Religious Affairs Minister, Mahaweli Development and Environment Deputy Minister, Foreign Affairs Ministry, Law and Order Ministry and a Provincial Governor.
Funds were also sought to renovate official residences of Women and Child Affairs Minister and Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister.
Addressing a news briefing on Wednesday, JO Leader and MP Dinesh Gunawardane said they would take measures to prevent the governments latest move to purchase new vehicles.
This is not the need of the hour. The government should focus on eradicating the dengue menace across the country and to upgrade the facilities at hospitals. It is time for the government to do away with luxurious lifestyle. We are strongly against this supplementary estimate, he said. (By Lahiru Pothmulla)

Jones took us through tragedy and traffic jams
	

Weekday evenings can be terrible. Bus rides are always stifling, often suffocating, never the relief they should be. I find returning home a bother, consequently, since theres always too many people.
Not that I am averse to them, of course not. Its just that its difficult to wade through the return journey, while standing. People get in by the dozen, traffic jams are terrible, while the conductor operates on the principle that the number of passengers must be disproportionate to the capacity of the vehicle. 
One evening, when it was raining heavily despite the sun peeping in from above, the weather was unbearably humid. There was a traffic jam starting from Race Course that stretched towards Havelock Town. I had to tolerate everything while standing when someone (the driver, I think) switched on the radio. I heard a voice. Sunflowers was accompanying him (which I didnt like). It took some time for me to remember the name. The author was Anton Jones. 
It was one of those non-stop playlists where one song follows another in quick succession. Given the intolerable, overwhelming state I was in, I neednt have bothered listening. But then the speakers were right above me and I couldnt ignore the music. So I listened. And so the lyrics flowed. Heres what I heard: 

Mama wadata yanne dawal dahaya pahu wela
Mage yaluwo atha ma enathura pula pula
Ape loku mahathmaya ena welawa bala bala
Gee gayanawa mithuran ha ekwela
The mood shifted, but the voice didnt: 
Baluwama ahinsakayi
Me miniha hari wasayiUtterly listenable, I thought to myself: Komala papa mukulu papa
Ape langata ennako
Omari latha bolanda katha
Apata kiya dennako

Then I remembered. Anton Jones died last year. February. He was all of 76. What a life, I thought. They dont come like that anymore, I reflected. And smiled. 

Anton Jones songs were like that. You didnt have to intellectualise what the man was saying because he was talking about us, and to us. Baila lyrics have no meaning outside themselves.

About a year ago I wrote on M. S. Fernando. Heres what I observed: 
The dichotomy that he revealed  between the life he wanted us to enjoy and the manifest lack of security and money needed to sustain such a lifestyle  defines the best baila melodies. Even today. Small wonder, then, that his work was shirked by a conventional society, a society that emphasised on thrift over spending.
When M. S. Fernando sang about expatriates who returned from afar, loaded and affluent in, Mama Enne Dubai Rate Indala, he sang about everyone of us who yearned for more than what we had. That opened up the dichotomy which baila, ever since it was indigenised here by the traffic-warden-turned-performer Wally Bastian, operated on, between the comfortable lives we hankered after and the constraints we had to endure. No other musical genre here captured audiences in this manner. 
The 6/8 beat that baila was born from was made for collective, sensual enjoyment. I dont claim to know the history of the genre and, in any case, it doesnt matter. What matters is that the 6/8 beat was a great leveller. It did away with barriers, ensnared both prince and pauper, and brought every listener together. It embodied a nearly perfect combination of quickness and pace. One could dance to it, one could embrace movement, and all the while one could still listen and comprehend. 
Anton Jones songs were like that. You didnt have to intellectualise what the man was saying because he was talking about us, and to us. Baila lyrics have no meaning outside themselves. Their meaning was apparent because if it wasnt, we wouldnt bother reading into what was being said. To this end, Anton spoke about real incidents, about people who lived and suffered and martyred themselves for a cause not many considered worthwhile. When Maru Sira was caught and executed, he sang about him. When Podi Wije was shot, he was there. And when a cyclone devastated the country in 1978, we didnt take long to hear his voice. 
He was like that. Utterly inescapable. 
I sometimes wonder why we detest and still embrace baila. After reading that article on M. S., someone emailed me a comment. Heres what he wrote: 
Whereas Ves Natum can divide cultures, baila unifies everyone on the dance floor. What has always amused me is that it is Sri Lankas own hybrid colonial class, the product of baila culture, which has often denigrated its value as an art form.
It was this culture of denigration, I am convinced, that compelled Amaradeva to let go of his baila streak and spend the rest of his career composing raga-based sarala gee. One only has to listen to Pipi Pipi, to Gayana Geyum, and to that irrepressible, lovable classic Atha Gaw Ganan Durin, to sense that baila streak (his Christian background would have helped, along with his childhood in Moratuwa). Personally I dont see anything to be bemoaned in his later compositions, but imagine the versatility, the vividness, the vivacity, of what might have been! 
The prejudice against baila is middle class and, therefore, rather hypocritical (not that hypocrisy of this sort is the preserve of the middle class, of course). Its rooted in what is considered as the genres tendency to awaken our baser instincts, since theres nothing much to read into its melodies. When Pauline Kael encountered someone who claimed that a film, like a poem, is, she retorted: Why does cinema have to mean something Do you expect a work by Bach to mean something The same can be said of baila. The fact that it took decades for someone like Sunil Ariyaratne to write on the genre from an academic standpoint says a lot, I should think.  What does one mean by baser instincts in the first place Is it to do with our joint disapproval of the melody as a secular, sensual, never-to-be-tolerated activity I know a young boy who insults several vocalists considered legendary by his elders with the telling epithet Eeya! I suspect that signifies how dissatisfied his generation is with those marketed as icons. They have been icon-ised so much that we forget their true worth, and in forgetting their true worth (because in this country, an icon is, even at his or her worst, an icon) we denigrate every other person. When a work of art and artist are elevated so highly without paying attention to why they should be elevated, you get a rather gandabba cultural sphere operating on that false low culture/high culture dichotomy. False, because it never really exists. 
Baila is arguably the most hybrid musical genre we have. Its less an achcharuwa, however, than a bouillabaisse; the more people there are to accompany the vocalist, the richer and the more meaningful the song becomes. They also borrowed wildly; the chorus in Kanthoruwa is set to Jingle Bells, while Mini Gavuma is set to The Battle Hymn of the Republic. (For what reason, I cant tell.) But we have conditioned ourselves to despise hybridism. We seek purity, in form and in content, with every work of art we come across, forgetting that unity can never be found in purity, only in diversity. After all Sinhala owes its texture to both Hela and Pali, which logically means that not even Amaradeva, or for that matter Sunil Shantha, were purists. They themselves would be the first to admit this, though their fan-base (which in one sense was their electorate) would vehemently claim otherwise. 
After the Indian raag, baila was our foremost external musical influence. One infers it in some of Amaradevas compositions, much of Khemadasas more vibrant work in the seventies, the Clarences, the Annesleys, the Anil Bharathis, the Stanley Perieses, the Gypsies, and even some of Sunil Ariyaratnes lyrics (Master Baila, Sukiri Batillange Geethaya). Its influence was always pervasive. We enjoyed it in our youth, but as we grew older and embraced a more conservative ethic, some of us conditioned ourselves to spurn it. No two guesses for figuring out why; all those hopes, all those fantasies, of the people that the likes of Anton Jones celebrated with their melodies, belonged to our youth, and were at once idle and indulgent. 
When a song like Kanthoruwa moved away from this trend and spoke about older people, it spoke about the kind of old people we were warned against, not unlike the Handamamas and the Boru Kakul Karayas (because yes, one can sense the baila streak in those melodies that Premakeerthi de Alwis and Freddie Silva worked on). 
The problem was that these songs were never didactic, while the middle class were. They purported to tell us something, but it was up to us to condone or condemn. We could have been the worker from Kanthoruwa, we could have been the husband from Mini Gavuma, but we didnt really care. We revelled in our own pathetic existence when we realised the singer sympathised with us. I suppose that explains why they were vilified by our elders. The middle class aspired for more than what they were. They didnt want to be reminded that they were also aspiring for more than they had. So they did the inevitable; they shirked and vilified M. S., Anton, and later, Paul Fernando and Christopher Paul. It was, at one level, a defence mechanism to compensate for their inhibitions. They would resort to it frequently. 
The other day I suddenly heard Anton Jones. He was, I daresay, the last of the best. Those who remain and take and sing after them were bequeathed to us by his generation. For having enriched us and our pathetic condition, despite what our elders would say, for having taught us to dance and to listen to what made us dance, I dont think we can be grateful enough. He outlasted them all: M. S. was 58 when he died, and would have been 82 were he alive. We remember Anton everywhere. We ought to continue doing so. Every day.

Lankan beats love rival to death in UK
	
A jealous husband whose wife was planning to divorce him had kidnapped the new man in her life and beat him to death, a British court heard this week.
According to the Milton Keynes Citizen, Sri Lanka-born Gnanachandran Balachandran is said to have recruited two others to help snatch the man he saw as a rival, Suren Sivananthan, while he was at a shopping centre in Milton Keynes, UK.
The trio, which included a 17-year-old teenager, then held Suren captive for 12 hours while subjecting him to a series of sustained beatings in various locations around Milton Keynes.
They finally dumped the 32-year-old, bleeding from a serious head wound and stripped of his blood-stained clothing, near a pond outside the Co-op at Great Linford, the jury heard.
His body was discovered at 4am on January 21 this year.
Prosecutor John Price QC said Suren had 39 separate injuries to his head and neck. The top of his scalp was split open by a blunt force impact and his eye socket was badly damaged.
The body showed obvious signs of numerous blunt force injuries, particularly to the head and face. Suren was severely beaten during a prolonged violent assault, he said.
The jury at Luton Crown Court heard how Sri Lanka-born Suren had flown to the UK to visit Balachandrans estranged wife Ragupathy Annalingham a couple of weeks previously.
The pair had known each other as children in Sri Lanka and were reunited through Facebook after mum-of-one Ragupathy decided to end her unhappy marriage.
Suren flew to the UK to meet the woman he had not seen for 18 years. But because the traditional society of Sri Lanka would not have approved, they kept their relationship secret.
Jealous Balachandran, 38, also from Sri Lanka, told her: You cant live with your husband and so you take someone else. You are a bad person, the jury heard.
He and two other defendants Kiroraj Yogarajah, 30, and Prashanth Thevarasa, 24, are all from Milton Keynes. All three deny murder.
The fourth defendant cannot be named for legal reasons because he is only 17. He has pleaded not guilty to an alternative charge of causing grievous bodily harm (a criminal offence) with intent.

No immediate need to strike: GMOA
	
The GMOA today said the meeting it had with Prime Minister Ranil Wikcremesinghe on Wednesday with regard to the SAITM issue was positive and therefore there was no immediate necessity to resort to a trade union action.
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge told the Daily Mirror that they had discussed with the Premier the five proposals put forward by them against the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) including the proposal to nationalize it.
He said the meeting held at Temple Trees was attended by GMOA representatives, the Prime Minister and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne.
During this meeting, the Prime Minister studied the five proposals and said he did not see anything wrong with these proposals, he said.
When the Prime Minister inquired from Minister Senaratne about the issues he had on these proposals, Minister Senaratne had asked whether the proposal to suspend student enrollments at SAITM was temporarily or permanently, he added.
He said the GMOA was in need to suspend SAITMs student enrollment permanently and added that however they had requested the Prime Minister to at least implement a legal framework to suspend it temporarily.
He said the Prime Minister had thereafter instructed Minister Senaratne to implement a legal framework on the suspension of student enrollments at the SAITM and added that the response given by Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne during this meeting was appreciable.
He said they had also discussed on the problems in relation to the appointing of a Chairman to the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) and court cases pending on SAITM issue.
More discussions will be held with the government following the meeting held on Wednesday, Therefore, there is no immediate necessity to resort to a trade union action during this period, he said. (By Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Robert O. Blake rejects plans on rescuing Prabhakaran
	
Former US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Robert O. Blake has said that it was a myth that he orchestrated a rescue of Tamil refugees from a northern beach to help LTTE Leader Velupillai Prabhakaran escape Sri Lankan armed forces, India Abroad news reported on Tuesday. 
Blake said it was also fiction that the US helped sink LTTE boats but acknowledged that US intelligence did provide information to the Sri Lankan navy about the boats location.
Blakes remarks came last month during a talk to the Serendipity Group, a nonpolitical group of Washington-based friends of Sri Lanka, which comprises several former US ambassadors and other diplomats who served in Sri Lanka.
Blake said even eight years after Prabhakaran was declared dead, myths continued to circulate and his role in the more than 20-year ethnic conflict, in which more than 70,000 Sri Lankans were killed, continues to be questioned.
He told the group he wanted to clear up some misinformation that continues to circulate about some of the things we worked on when I was ambassador from 2006 to 2009.
Blake said the biggest myth was centered on the beach rescue. To this day, a story circulates about an effort I organized to try to rescue tens of thousands of IDPs from the beach at Puthukkudiyiruppu. The Story says it was an effort to evacuate Prabakharan.
He said there was no intention to help the LTTE. To the contrary, the plan was to rescue as many IDPs whom the LTTE had refused to allow to move south through the lines of fighting and were in effect human shields, he said.
Every person would have been transferred by US Navy boat to Sri Lankan custody. There was a detailed plan coordinated with the Sri Lankan and India governments. Unfortunately, the Sri Lankan government killed the idea for fear that Norwegian peace broker Eric Solheim and I would be taken hostage by the LTTE, he said adding it was something they did not believe would happen.
He also denied involvement in sinking LTTE ships. He said the US helped the Sri Lankan navy locate the boats, which were carrying arms for the LTTE. SL navy actually sank the boats, he said.
He said the US decision to support a 2012 UN Human Rights Council resolution has also been a source of continued criticism. He said he initially had argued in favor of letting the Sri Lankan government work on reconciliation and accountability so they could craft their own solution internally.
Domestic ownership is always preferable. Indeed the Sri Lankan government came up with the Lessons Learned and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC), which had many positive aspects. But it failed to address serious allegations of violations of international law, particularly at the end of the war, he said.
So we decided to support a landmark resolution that welcomed the LLRC report; called for its implementation; called on the Sri Lankan government to take credible actions to ensure justice and accountability for all Sri Lankans, he said.
Blake praised the countrys January 2015 presidential elections which he called a sea-change in Sri Lankan politics.
Suddenly we had a government in power that promised many of the political, economic and social reforms that Sri Lankan civil society and the international community had been seeking and chose a lot of reformers as ministers to carry out those reforms, he said.
But while saying several of these reforms had been implemented, Blake bemoaned lack of progress in other areas, such as the Office of Missing Persons, which he said has yet to be set up despite its approval in August 2016.
This is really important on many levels due to the large number of enforced disappearances, white van abductions and many people who went missing after the war. Progress on a new constitution to strengthen devolution also is slow, he said.
He said much ink has been spilled on the divisions in the unity government that often lead to focus more on political maneuvering than forging coalitions on specific issues to get things done.
He said he was optimistic that the government has reaffirmed its ambitious plans in the most recent UNHRC resolution in March.
However, Blake said Rajapaksa continues to be a spoiler opposing efforts on reconciliation and transitional justice, casting them as capitulation to western interests. But from what I can tell, President Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe still have the will to move forward, he said.
He said continued friendship with Sri Lanka brings many advantages, among them its strategic location astride the main Indo-Pacific sea lanes through which pass two-thirds of global oil supplies and half of the worlds container cargo, with the port of Colombo being South Asias busiest trans-shipment port.

SLFP, Mahanayakas want only reforms to Constitution: Dilan
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the joint opposition are agitating for a new constitution and the abolition of the executive presidency while the SLFP and Mahanayakas of three Nikayas want to retain the executive presidency and introduce reforms to the existing Constitution, Minister and SLFP spokesman Dilan Perera said.
Minister Perera said he wondered whether there was a hidden agenda between the UNP and the JO to weaken President Maithripala Sirisena's stature and added that President Sirisena had on many instances said that he would not play to the tune of the UNP.
Addressing the SLFP weekly news briefing at the party office today, he said it was clearly manifested that the UNP and the JO were working on the same wave length and in cahoots on constitutional reforms and the executive presidency in quite contrast to the position taken by the Maha Sangha.
The SLFP also wants to introduce electoral reforms with reintroduction of the first past the post system.
We have not forgotten the clashes between President Chandrika Kumaratunga and the 2002  2004 UNP government. She was highly embarrassed at the cabinet meetings when UNP members alleged that she had cameras and bombs in her hand bag. Ultimately President Kumaratunga stopped attending cabinet meetings. But President Sirisena has shown that he is a strong leader, Minister Perera said.
He said the President has successfully addressed the challenges confronted by the Yahapalana Government in the last two years.
The VAT issue, Uma-Oya protest and SAITM problem were diligently and pragmatically solved. He would not have done this if he played underdog to the UNP, the minister said. (By Sandun A Jayasekera)

Study finds which angle women look most attractive
	

DPA, 12th JULY, 2017- While taking the perfect selfie is more art than science, a group of researchers recently turned up an interesting discovery in the field of photographing oneself.
They found that women are perceived as more attractive when they turn the left side of their face towards the camera. If a woman tilts her face to the right, she is seen as more willing to help, according to the psychology study from the University of Bamberg in Germany.
Men can also benefit from choosing the right perspective, but in their case the effect is not so pronounced.
The researchers asked more than 300 test subjects to look at images of 3-D computer-generated models of human faces at seven different angles, all of which were from a selfie perspective.
Subjects then had to give their opinion about the depicted persons attractiveness, dominance, intelligence and body weight - based just off the image.
So it seems that sometimes turn the other cheek might be good advice after all - at least during a selfie session.

Tobaccounmasked.lk is now loaded with info Unmasking giants setting the tobacco trap
	
It burns, it fumes, it embraces your system and it kills. This phrase clinically identifies the intoxicant we popularly call the cigarette- that mix of nicotine, lead, hydrogen cyanide, arsenic, radioactive elements and other chemicals and toxins. While we speak of a greener, healthier tomorrow, many are dying behind the scenes as a result of this monstrous industry which has negatively influenced the lives of many.
In an attempt to win this battle and save innocent lives, the Centre for Combating Tobacco (CCT) was established in May 2016 at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo in order to monitor activities of the tobacco industry in Sri Lanka and the region. Its partner organisations include the National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol (NATA), Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA) and Alcohol and Drug Information Centre (ADIC). In a progressive step towards reaching its goal, the CCT recently launched its official information portal  tobaccounmasked.lk. 

User-friendly website
tobaccounmasked.lk will serve as the information portal of the CCT, which will contain basic information about the tobacco industry, with detailed profiles of tobacco companies, companies relevant to Sri Lanka and their employees. The website also contains profiles of tobacco industry allies, institutions and individuals linked with the industry in various ways. 
tobaccounmasked.lk describes the strategies adopted by the tobacco industry by influencing policy, tobacco tax and price related issues, corporate social investments, tobacco cultivation and marketing and promotion. The arguments presented by the tobacco industry and their responses against different policy processes are reported as a learning exercise for future reference. 

tobaccounmasked. lk describes the strategies adopted by the tobacco industry by influencing policy, tobacco tax and price related issues
This is a user-friendly website and it will contain information produced by researchers and experts in
the field. Before information is posted on the site, it will be reviewed in order to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data. 

They operate in disguise Dr.Palitha Abeykoon
Speaking at the event, National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol (NATA) Chairman, Dr.Palitha Abeykoon said that the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) was the first and the only international law on health, initiated by the World Health Organisation (WHO).
The FCTC treaty hence entered into force in February 2005, legally binds 180 ratifying countries as of 2017. The FCTC was adopted as an answer to the globalization of the tobacco epidemic. We were able to establish the NATA Act of 2003 and it works in collaboration with the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Presidential Task Force on Tobacco and Drug Prevention (PTFDP). The FCTC has 16 different articles and article 5.3 specifically dwells on implementing public health policies in the respective countries in relation to tobacco and alcohol control. But on the contrary there are countries that have voted in favor of the FCTC but have invited tobacco companies to rule them over.

Even in Sri Lanka, we still see the subtle interference by these companies when they advertise themselves on popular magazines that are published for tourists

In countries such as China, tobacco companies come under the purview of the Ministry of Finance which is more powerful than the MOH. Therefore its a serious profit-making business there. Even in Sri Lanka, we still see the subtle interference by these companies when they advertise themselves on popular magazines that are published for tourists. As a result they operate in disguise and we have to get rid of this menace. 


One will unintentionally get trappedProf. Lakshman Dissanayake
Also present at the launch was Professor Lakshman Dissanayake, Vice Chancellor of the University of Colombo who said that monitoring the behaviour of those in the tobacco and alcohol industry was one of his interests. As someone who has been interested in studying demographics and social science, I showed a keen interest in studying the social aspects of various behaviours including that of the tobacco and alcohol industry. This tobacco business is something that a person will unintentionally get trapped in to. Therefore research is important for us to document the process and to unearth who actually influenced the people. In the mean time we also need to identify those who have given up on these habits despite the influences. By establishing units such as the CCT, the university can now conduct research on new fields. There are three aspects that we consider; Teaching, Training and Outreach and UOC have mastered all these aspects. This is why we have been ranked among the top 1000 universities. 


Its a vector with much vengeanceDr. Mahesh Rajasuriya
In his comments, Consultant Psychiatrist and Director of CCT, Dr. Mahesh Rajasuriya emphasized on the need to promote everyday as a World No Tobacco Day. The tobacco industry has been identified as a vector of disease thereby playing a pivotal role in causing harm to health. Tobacco use is communicated through media, the entertainment industry and also by marketing various products associated with it. While a virus is transmitted, tobacco use is communicated. Other industries that cause harm to health include fast food and alcohol which mainly exist as multinationals. Therefore they can cause enough harm to not only people in one country, but in many countries where their franchises are established.
They exert their powers by throwing money and they also brainwash people by making them realize that if they smoke, they are normal. When doubts arise as to whether tobacco would cause cancer, these people would then say if people are predisposed, they will anyway get cancer even if they smoke or not. Hence they clear doubts of people and make it appear as a normal phenomenon. The money and power of these industries are such that they also get involved in controlling the agenda, thereby showing their potential in major industries such as tourism. 

The tobacco industry has been identified as a vector of disease thereby playing a pivotal role in causing harm to health

Speaking further Dr. Mahesh also elaborated on why people should be concerned about this industry. The tobacco industry steals children from parents and takes the father or the husband away from the family . A father who smokes doesnt stay with the family. His life revolves around the cigarette. The smoke and chemicals then distort your image, disables and infects your system, ultimately taking your life away. Therefore the tobacco industry is a vector with much vengeance and thus we need to identify its breeding sites, monitor new trends in the industry and fumigate them as and when they have been discovered.

Trump Jr. emails suggest he welcomed Russian help against Clinton
	
President Donald Trumps eldest son eagerly agreed last year to meet a woman he was told was a Russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about Democratic White House rival Hillary Clinton as part of Moscows official support for his father, according to emails released on Tuesday.
The emails, released by Donald Trump Jr., are the most concrete evidence yet that Trump campaign officials welcomed Russian help to win the election, a subject that has cast a cloud over Trumps presidency and spurred investigations by the Justice Department and Congress.
The messages show that the younger Trump was open to the prospect of very high level and sensitive information from a Russian attorney that a go-between described as part of Russia and its governments support for Mr. Trump ahead of a meeting on June 9, 2016.
If its what you say I love it, TrumpJr. responded.
He released the messages on Twitter after the New York Times said it planned to write about them and sought comment from him. In an interview with Fox News, Trump Jr. said that Trumps campaign manager at the time, Paul Manafort, and son-in-law Jared Kushner, now a top White House adviser, also attended the meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who denies having Kremlin ties.
He said Veselnitskaya did not provide any damaging information about Clinton at the meeting and instead sought to discuss
Russian sanctions.
In retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently, he said. For me, this was opposition research.
Nevertheless, the correspondence between him and Rob Goldstone, a publicist who arranged the meeting, could provide fodder for U.S. investigators probing whether Trumps campaign colluded with the Kremlin.
