Accused SL human smuggler in Canada gets bail
	
A Sri Lankan man accused of bringing hundreds of Tamil asylum seekers into Canada illegally has been granted bail after more than six years in jail, the Record said today.
A British Colombia Supreme Court judge ruled on Thursday that Kunarobinson Christhurajah does not have to remain in custody while awaiting a new trial over allegations of human smuggling.
Last week, a jury was unable to reach a verdict in the case of Christhurajah, who is accused of organizing the voyage of the MV Sun Sea, a rickety cargo ship that transported 492 Tamil asylum seekers from Thailand to Canada in August 2010.
The jury found three other men not guilty.
Christhurajah's wife, Mary Patrishiya, sobbed outside the courtroom after learning the result of the bail hearing.
"I have no words," she said
Christhurajah's six-year-old daughter was with her mother outside court on Thursday. The girl was born months after the couple arrived in Canada aboard the Sun Sea.
"Nobody here. No friends. No family. I was pregnant. I had hardship the last six years," his wife said. "But I forgot everything in this moment."
The criminal trial against the four co-accused began in October and lasted four months.
The Crown argued Christhurajah was the owner of the Sun Sea based on evidence that he rented office space in Bangkok in 2008 and 2009 under a fake name on behalf of Sun & Rashiya Co., the company that officially owned the vessel.
Christhurajah's lawyer told the trial there was no evidence his client profited from his actions and the Crown had failed to prove he hadn't acted for a humanitarian purpose, the Vancouver Sun reported.
Christhurajah's bail conditions include to keep the peace, to report weekly to a bail supervisor and to refrain from contact with any of the three co-accused with whom he stood trial. He has also been ordered to pay a $10,000 recognizance.
Outside court, Christhurajah's lawyer said a new trial date has not been set for his client.

Alumni in unison with Alma Mater Silver jubilee of 1992 batch
	
We, the alumni of Presidents College Kotte wish to recall with gratitude on the completion of its 39th anniversary, how it became a great source of inspiration to lead our lives as disciplined and patriotic citizens of mother Lanka. Unreservedly, the entire credit for guiding us to walk on the right path as righteous adults, should be attributed to our whole tutorial staff since its inception, particularly the principals who went the whole hog to bring the school to its present glory. If not for their dedication and commitment, it is needless to mention that we would not have been able to witness its present pinnacle of success. 
It is the first Presidents College in Sri Lanka and was inaugurated by the late executive President J.R.Jayawardena as his first official task on the independence day of 1978, located at Independence Square as a mixed gender school. It was on June 21st 1983, that the school was moved to the present premises at Sri Jayawardenapura, Kotte. In the year 1990, it was elevated to the rank of a National School. The foundation has been laid for a swimming pool on 21st December 2016. 
Many who have stepped out of the gates of our alma mater have been able to serve their motherland in various capacities and are holding lucrative positions in different fields. We take pride to call ourselves as Past pupils of this highly acclaimed school. We were taught to live with humility, simplicity and piety. We are pleased to say that Presidents College in Kotte is steadfastly reaching its goal of excellence. 
We, the students of the 1992 batch, having completed 25 years since leaving school, as an offering of gratitude and to mark the occasion, have decided to provide financial aid to 25 students on February 3rd 2017. This ceremony will coincide with a religious ceremony of Chanting Pirith with the staff and the students of the school in celebration of the 39th anniversary of our school, invoking blessings for the continued success of our school.We have also arranged to reinstate the monumental plaque which was installed at the inaugural ceremony held at Torrington Square on February 4th 1978. The plaque will be unveiled on 4th February, 2017. All the past and present pupils and their parents are kindly requested to grace this occasion and extend their co-operation and assistance as a mark of gratitude. Fortunately for our school, all the principals in succession served with unswerving determination to do their best while continuing all the activities related to upgrading of the school carried out by their predecessors. 
The two institutions of paramount importance directly involved with the moulding of characters of persons are their homes and learning centres. The latter in which we spent the best of our times fulfilled their obligatory role very satisfactorily, and let its memory remain evergreen in us.

Bank of Ceylon offers portfolio management services
	
Being the number one bank in Sri Lanka, Bank of Ceylon (BOC) manages several funds at present and has decided to extend portfolio management service (PMS) to all clients including individuals, corporates and trust funds through its Investment Banking Division. Under this, BOC will manage the client funds and invest them in various products. BOC as the Bankers to the Nation has the stability, strength and trust and will offer the highest level of safety and investment returns to the client. The following segment is captured from an interview had with Deputy General Manager International, Treasury and Investment Sarath Jayasuriya.
Why does an investor need a dedicated portfolio manager
It is basically for four reasons. Firstly, a busy customer may not have enough spare time to find the best alternative for his investments. Secondly, as a premier financial institution, BOC has more access to frequently changing financial market information, which is not widely available to ordinary clients. Thirdly, the investor can have a hassle-free environment due to non-involvement in documentation. Fourthly, through proper diversification of clients assets, the investors can earn something more than investing in traditional deposits.
Is there any difference between your new service and investing in unit trusts
Yes. Unit trusts pool all the funds of investors and give the same return to all. But with BOC PMS, the investor can enjoy higher returns through a tailor-made investment mix depending on his risk appetites. The other difference is the investors are aware of where their funds were invested unlike in unit trust.
Is there a minimum tenure for the agreement
The minimum tenure for the agreement should be two years. Otherwise BOC is not in a position to generate progressive return. Higher the investment and longer the tenure give the investor more opportunities to enjoy higher returns, according to his risk appetite.
How strong is your investment management team
Our portfolio management team consists of well-qualified and experienced fund managers. They have international exposure in our overseas branches such as London and Chennai. Also, they continuously deal with various types of investment instruments. Also, we have experienced research analysts who examine the market information.
When does an investor get his returns
The investment returns/income could be received at the end of the agreement or as the agreed terms at the initial discussion.
What investment instruments are you going to offer to third party clients
There is a list of instruments, including government securities, treasury bills and bonds, fixed deposits, repo investments, debentures, commercial papers, unit trusts, shares and asset-backed trust certificates.
Is there any particular reason to select BOC as the portfolio manager
Yes. BOC has the highest public trust with an over one trillion deposit base. It is the largest and strongest commercial bank in the nation with 100 percent state ownership. In addition, BOC is a leading player in treasury operations. We have experience in managing our own funds for a long time. We do various kinds of research prior to investments. Furthermore, many people have difficulties in investing their funds and have requested us to manage those. Currently, we are the only state-owned commercial bank to fulfil their requirement. Feel free to contact the following officers to begin a rewarding relationship with the BOC portfolio management service: Assistant General Manager Investment Banking M.H.S. Mala (011 2394311), Deputy Chief Dealer Rajith Thushantha (011 2203663) and Senior Manager Investments Chandima Herath (011 2448348).

Cant solve Tamil issue by chasing me away: CV
	
Northern Provincial Council Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran today said that the Tamil peoples issues could not be solved by chasing him away.
Replying to a statement made by Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara recently, he made this remark at a function held in Vavuniya to declare open the new two-storey building of the Vavuniya South Sinhala Pradeshiya Sabha.
Minister Jayasekara recently said that I should be banished from the Northern Province. But the issues faced by Tamils would not be solved by banishing me. Not only me, even my successor will say the same thing I said as we always speak the truth,he said. (Romesh Madusanka)

Ceylinco Life to launch 10th Life Insurance Week on Feb. 11
	
An annual, countrywide campaign to widen the life insurance net through interaction with the masses gets underway on Saturday, February 11, when Ceylinco Life launches its Life Insurance Week (LIW).
The life insurance leader said it plans to deploy some 4,500 sales people from 260 branches at a series of activities and engagements in key towns and villages in a concerted effort to take the message of life insurance to the grassroots.
In its 10th edition, Ceylinco Lifes 2017 LIW will focus on the theme that the cost of waiting to buy life insurance is too high. Using a simple yet effective illustration, the company will demonstrate that buying life insurance sooner rather than later can result in significant savings in premium payments.
Among the activities planned by the company to engage with its target audiences are regional town storming programmes in 40 locations around the country to create better awareness of the importance of life insurance, special screenings of some of the latest movies at eight cinemas in Anuradhapura, Ja Ela, Kurunegala, Galle, Ratnapura, Ambalangoda, Jaffna and Batticaloa and art competitions in some of Ceylinco Lifes own branches.
The penetration of life insurance is around 13 percent at present and our objective is to increase this figure by educating people on the value of the protection it offers, Ceylinco Life Director/Deputy CEO Thushara Ranasinghe said.
The Life Insurance Week programme has been an effective way of reaching out to the masses and has generated higher than average sales of policies during the campaign period. He said the LIW initiative supports Ceylinco Lifes vision, which is, To take the message of life insurance and retirement planning to every Sri Lankan and provide protection to every family.

Colour - with some sombre undertones
	
An exhibition of paintings by one of Sri Lankas best known, best loved and most accomplished artists, S.H. Sarath, was held at the Harold Peiris Gallery of the Lionel Wendt Art Centre over the weekend. The above-mentioned attributes do not always co-exist happily for an artist. Sarath has demonstrated an ability to achieve material success without losing his values or identity. The works on display at the preview on Friday reflected his characteristically ironic interpretations, hints of satire, at times bordering on the surreal. His work is typically informed by a subtext of compassion for his fellow human beings. 
Colour was the name of this exhibit, and colourful it was. Humans in various postures, female forms, faces, embracing couples, trees  both living and dying, were among the subjects. Less in evidence were the black and white line drawings, which are among his most interesting works. The few on display were however representative of his trademark style of satirical social commentary. Whether it was a Buddha sitting in meditation amidst tree stumps that were once a forest, a coffin surrounded by a variety of elements (open to interpretation by the viewer), or an assemblage of flag-waving men being herded along (or devoured) by monsters  Saraths line drawings always offer food for thought. If some of the paintings were weighted in favour of a colour palette that gripped the eye rather than the soul, it would be fair to say this was more a reflection of the context in which the artist works in contemporary society  which Sarath is keenly aware of  rather than any diminishing of his artistic integrity. 
Having completed his early education at Weligama Siddhartha Maha Vidyalaya and Weligama Sri Sumangala Maha Vidyalaya, Sarath started his artistic training at the Government College of Fine Arts, Colombo in 1968. He is in that sense a very home-grown artist. He then honed his skills with a UNESCO fellowship on painting research at Silpakorn University of Fine Arts in Bangkok and later a print-making course at the University of South Australia School of Art, Adelaide. Over the years he has held many honorary positions in institutions relating to education and the arts, including that of Vice President of the Ceylon Society of Arts (Sri Lanka) and member of the Arts Panel of the Sri Lanka Ministry of Cultural Affairs. He has also lent his talents in an honorary capacity to a number of community projects, such as the four-storey mural at the National Library Services Board, Colombo. 
Sarath has won numerous awards and displayed his work in solo and group exhibitions (too many to list), in a formidable list of countries: Canada, Norway, UK, Germany, Cuba, Brazil, France, Yugoslavia, Switzerland, Nepal, Korea, Japan, Bangladesh, India, Thailand, Malaysia and Australia. Notable among them are solo exhibitions at the Adelaide Fringe Festival, at the Aud Slingnes Gallery in Stavanger  Norway, and at the United Nations, Palais de Nations in Geneva. 
It is perhaps testimony to his non-partisan attitude that Sarath has had patronage from diverse political personalities. He recalls with some pride how the late Nalini Wickremesinghe, mother of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was chief guest at one of his first exhibitions held at the Hotel Lanka Oberoi (as it was then called). Former president Chandrika Kumaratunga too had assisted him at one point. Among the literary figures whose encouragement he remembers with gratitude are the late Prof. Ashley Halpe and Martin Wickremesinghe  the latter having been chief guest at his first solo exhibition at the Lionel Wendt, Colombo. Sarala Fernando and Jayantha Dhanapala were among the diplomats whose names came up in the course of conversation with Sarath, as people who supported him in his chosen vocation. 
Relating how a scribble he had produced in the 1970s had been bought by a patron for Rs.500 and had been resold in the 1990s for Rs. 500,000, Sarath observed that there is a market for art in Sri Lanka. He regretted however, that art appreciation is lacking and lamented the absence of a national gallery that could house a permanent display of the best Sri Lankan art.

Deutsche Bank posts 1.9bn 4Q loss as legal bill weighs
	
REUTERS: Deutsche Bank posted a net loss of 1.9 billion euros (US $ 2.05 billion) in the fourth quarter as legal costs for past misdeeds outstripped gains from a rebound in bond trading.
Germanys flagship lender missed the higher expectations of analysts who had expected the bank to post a fourth-quarter net loss of just 1.16 billion euros.
The bank hiked its litigation reserves to 7.6 billion euros from 5.9 billion euros in the quarter, as it had to put more money aside for settlements such as over the sale of toxic mortgages and sham Russian trades. Revenues at its cash cow bond trading division were up 11 percent in the quarter as it benefited from a surge in trading across interest rate products, commodities and foreign exchange (FICC) as investors responded to Donald Trumps victory in the U.S. presidential election.
But it lost market share to Wall Street banks, some of which more than doubled bond revenues, in part due to paring back its investment bank, where it has thrown out products and cut ties with thousands of clients.
While Deutsche Bank, in 2013, ranked third globally for FICC trading, it slipped to sixth place by mid-2016, according to the latest data from industry analytics firm Coalition.
We are optimistic after a promising start to this year, Chief Executive John Cryan said in a statement. Almost all businesses had a strong start in January, the bank said.
Deutsche Bank shares fell 1.9 percent in pre-market trading at brokerage Lang & Schwarz, while Germanys blue-chip index was seen down 0.3 percent.
The amount of money it has set aside to cover the legal bill for past missteps rose 29 percent to 7.6 billion euros at year-end, compared to the end of September, while it upped provisions for possible future legal action by 38 percent to 2.2 billion.
Whilst 2015 and 2016 were peak years for litigation, 2017 continues to be burdened by resolving legacy matters, the bank said in a presentation.
In equities trading, Deutsche Bank saw revenues decrease in the quarter as hedge fund activity retreated, while revenues from corporate and investment banking edged up despite Deutsche Bank missing out on advising clients on some large deals.
Total revenues were up 7.5 percent at 7.1 billion euros in the quarter.

Fmr Norwegian PM held at US Airport for visiting Iran
	
Former Norwegian prime minister Kjell Magne Bondevik has said that he was questioned and prevented from leaving the WashingtonDulles Airport for about an hour on Tuesday apparently because he had visited Iran in 2014, the Business Standard said today. 
Bondevik, who flew into Dulles Airport from Europe on Tuesday afternoon, was not immediately allowed to leave after customs agents saw in his passport that he had been to Iran, reports ABC7.
His passport also indicates he is the former prime minister of Norway, a U.S. ally.
"Of course I fully understand the fear of letting terrorists come into this country," said Bondevik, adding that it should have been obvious he's not a terrorist.
"It should be enough when they found that I have a diplomatic passport, [that I'm a] former prime minister. That should be enough for them to understand that I don't represent any problem or threat to this country and [to] let me go immediately, but they didn't," he said.
Bondevik, who served as the prime minister of Norway from 1997-2000 and 2001-2005, said that he was placed in a room with travellers from the Middle East and Africa who were also facing extra scrutiny.
He said that he had to sit and wait for about 40 minutes and then he was questioned for about 20 minutes regarding a trip to Iran in 2014.
Bondevik, also the president of a human rights organization called The Oslo Center, went to Iran in 2014 to speak at a human rights conference there.
Although President Trump's controversial temporary travel ban has led to extra scrutiny of many travellers in the past week, Bondevik said that he was told the scrutiny he received had nothing to do with it.
Instead, it was related to a 2015 law signed by then president Barack Obama. The law signed in the wake of terrorist attacks in California and Paris was aimed at protecting the U.S. from terrorists.
It places extra restrictions on some citizens from 38 countries -- including Norway -- that are part of the US's Visa Waiver Program.
Citizens of those countries normally do not need a visa to visit the US for up to 90 days, but because of the law they now do need a visa if they have been to Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Syria, Libya, Somalia or Yemen since March 2011. Those are the same seven countries Trump included in his temporary travel ban.
Bondevik said that his office contacted the US Embassy in Oslo prior to his trip this week and was told his passport and a separate electronic travel authorization (called ESTA) would be sufficient to enter the United States.
"I was surprised, and I was provoked. What will the reputation of the US be if this happens not only to me, but also to other international leaders" he said about being set aside for questioning.
A spokesperson with US Customs and Border Protection said CBP is prohibited by privacy laws from discussing specifics of any.
Bondevik came to the US to attend Thursday morning's National Prayer Breakfast at the Washington Hilton.

The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) said today said it would even seek international intervention to revise the ruling directing the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to register SAITM's MBBS graduates.
GMOA media spokesman Naveen de Soyza told a news conference that they would not allow this injustice to continue because it violates standards upheld by the SLMC.
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne would not have permitted the legalization of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) by overruling the SLMC recommendations, if he was not SAITM-friendly, he said.
Dr. de Soysa said it was questionable whether he would over-ridden the decision made by President Maithripala Sirisena as the then Health Minister to refrain from enrolling medical students to SAITM. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Govt. expects to finish off Htota Port sale deal this week
	
The final details of the agreement to sell the Hambantota Port shares to Chinese State-owned enterprise China Merchant Port Holdings (CMPH) will be finalized this week and the details of the agreement would be announced soon, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
On the Hambantota Port agreement, the Prime Minister and the Cabinet Sub Committee is meeting today and it will be announced today or tomorrow, Karunanayake said yesterday.
When asked what exactly would be discussed at the Cabinet Sub Committee meeting, he replied that there are some issues remaining to be ironed out, after which they would finish off the agreement.
The government is planning to sell 80 percent of the Hambantota Port shares to CMPH for US$ 1.12 billion for 99 years.
The government had planned to sign the agreement by January 8, 2017, in order to coincide with their rise to power on January 8, 2015, but then postponed the agreement signing to be within January.
The grand Chinese plan hopes to make the Hambantota Port viable by creating trade volumes through 3 neighbouring industrial zones to which Chinese factories would be relocated to take advantage of Sri Lankas lower labour costs and strategic location.
China had also said that other countries are welcome to invest in the zones. However, without signing an agreement with a Chinese entity to develop the industrial zoneswhich would total over 15,000 acres and 2,600 factoriesthe government went ahead and launched the industrial zones last month.
Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama, who had announced this plan, had last month said that CMPH would still be willing to go ahead with the Hambantota Port agreement even if the industrial zoneswhich would make the port viabledo not progress.
Both the sale of the port and the provision of land for the industrial zones have run into heavy public resistance.The manner of selecting the partner for the port is also being questioned by politicians of the former regime, since they assert that China Harbour Engineering Companya sister company of Chinese state owned CMPH, which was also directed by the Chinese government to bid for the porthad presented a better deal in terms of profit sharing and the duration of the lease.
When asked why the government had not opted for an international tender for the sale of the port, Karunanayake said that since a government to government opportunity presented itself, there was no need for a tender process.
Further, he shot down the possibility of Sri Lanka attracting a better deal for the port from another party through a tender. (Chandeepa Wettasinghe)

MR should support us or retire from politics immediately: Ruwan
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa should either retire from politics or make up his mind to support the governments efforts to develop the country and to bring in peace and reconciliation, State Minister of Defense Ruwan Wijewardene said yesterday.
It is the former President and the joint opposition which will create separatism in this country by arousing communalism and provoking the people. They are trying to provoke people through false propaganda as that is the only way they would be able to come back into power. Ex. President Rajapaksa should either retire from politics or help the government to bring in development and reconciliation without jeopardizing the work undertaken by us, Mr. Wijewardene said.
Mr. Wijewardene was speaking at a ceremony held in Biyagama to distribute spectacles to children with visual defects last evening. He said there is no truth
whatsoever in the statement made by the joint opposition that the intelligence units in the country have come to a standstill. If that is the case how did our intelligence units get to know about the plot to kill TNA MP M A Sumanthiran, he asked.
Further, Mr Wijewardene said the government had closed down only a few small security forces camps while all strategically important camps are still functioning.
The State Minister said a political solution was needed to resolve the national issue as the war victory alone will not eradicate terrorism. Our government will devolve power only after ensuring the unitary status of the country, he added. (Yohan Perera)

Unconditional  Muslim Support facilitated  islands independence
	

In the aftermath of the World War 11, agitation for political reforms and independence began to gather momentum. However the British government insisted that three quarters of the population should support the demand for independence to ensure that the rights of minorities were protected. With the Sinhalese community as a whole constituting less than three quarters of the population, this was an impossible demand to fulfil unless the minorities supported it.


Crucial Muslim support facilitated the process of Sri Lanka gaining independence from the British in 1948 and helped end almost four and half centuries of European colonial rule in the island. 
Many still remember the leading role played by Muslim leaders such as Dr. T.B. Jayah, Sir Razik Fareed, Dr. M.C.M. Kaleel and Dr. Badi-ud-din Mahmud in the constitutional reforms of this country and their enthusiastic support for the demand of the Dominion Status and independence. They never obstructed the political progress of the country. 
For example when the demand for independence began gathering momentum, World War 11 broke out in Europe. The British government urged all its colonies to support them assuring that they would be given independence after the war. 
In the aftermath of the World War 11, agitation for political reforms and independence began to gather momentum. However the British government insisted that three quarters of the population should support the demand for independence to ensure that the rights of minorities were protected. With the Sinhalese community as a whole constituting less than three quarters of the population, this was an impossible demand to fulfil unless the minorities supported it. 
Tamil Congress leader G.G. Ponnambalam demanded equal representation, better known as fifty fifty. However the Muslims stood fully behind the majority community and helped to meet the British demand for the support of two third of the population, despite past sufferings and disadvantages. 
Addressing a gathering at the Zahira College grounds under the chairmanship of Sir Mohamed Macan Markar to protest against the inadequate representation of Muslims in the Legislative Council, Dr. Badi-ud-din Mahmud, the Secretary of the All Ceylon Muslim Political Conference said on 5 March 1939; 
Let me assure my Sinhalese countrymen that I am one among them in demanding complete freedom for our country. They can count on me as one of the most ardent admirers of their legitimate national and cultural aspirations. In me and in my community, let them know that they find the most trusted friends and kind neighbours in this island. They would never find wanting in me or in my community that unflinching loyalty and patriotism that this little island would demand one day from its sons and daughters to carve out a niche of fame for itself as a self-respecting unit in a world federation. Let me also assure my Sinhalese friends that the brave community to which I belong shall never consider any sacrifice too great to make Lanka a happy, prosperous and glorious country in the world where not one section of its population but every son and daughter of her soil shall legitimately take pride in her glorious destiny. 
In keeping with this policy the three Muslim representatives in the State Council extended their whole-hearted support for the Dominion Status Bill  a Sri Lankan bill sponsored by the late Mr.S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike when it came for the vote on 9 November 1945. T.B. Jayah and Dr. M.C.M. Kaleel spoke in favour of the bill while Sir Razik Fareed and Dr. Kaleel voted in favour as Jayah was not present during the time of voting. 
During his speech Razik Fareed said; The All Ceylon Moors Association pledge their support to the resolution of the Hon. Leader under discussion today. Nothing else would at the moment give me great pleasure to do so, and to express my whole-hearted support to the Hon. leaders proposal. As my community and I have always stood by them, I must say that in the hour of his triumph we join hands with him in the forward march to the goal of the proposal to which he aspires 
Supporting the Sri Lankan Bill despite its disadvantages to Muslims and defining the attitude of Muslims towards the bill, Mr.T.B. Jayah said: I am glad, Sir, that it has been stated that this is not the moment for jubilation or exultation or even for mutual recrimination. I certainly think that this is not the occasion to speak of the discomfiture of the minority communities or of the victory of the majority community.
As far as I am concerned, I speak with the full support of members of the Muslim community. I saw to it that the Ceylon Muslim League, representing the Muslim community of Ceylon, consulted Muslim representatives in different parts of the country on the important issues before the house and I am in a position to say that the Muslim members of this Council have the fullest backing of the Muslim community in this island. 
When the Muslims of the Council decided to take a definite stand at the time the Sri Lanka Bill was introduced, they did so for one and one reason only. The reason was that where the political freedom of this country was involved, they were prepared to go to any length, even to the point of sacrificing advantages and benefit as a result of such action. As far as I am concerned, Sir, I do not consider any right greater than the right of political freedom and therefore, although I am fully conscious of those disadvantages of the Bill, looking at it from a narrow point of view, yet I am prepared to support this Bill.
Expressing his gratitude to the Muslim members on behalf of the Sinhalese community, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike assured that he would consider any reasonable request by the Muslim community. Bandaranaike said: I say that if any member has brought closer the achievement of agreement among the various sections of the people of the country by an attitude of generosity where even those with whom he is concerned to differ, I say the fullest credit must go more than to anyone else among us, to the Honorable nominated member, Mr. T.B. Jayah. He has made a speech today that will have a great effect in bringing unity among the people of this country in bringing some sense of reality to this struggle, however it may shape, that we are going to undertake to obtain a satisfactory measure of freedom.. 
What have the three members,T.B.Jayah, Dr. M.C.M. Kaleel and Razik Fareed, done There is provided in the Bill, a Scheme of Representation under which the Muslim community in this country might suffer in the form in which it appears, but yet, he himself so sincerely determined to work for the main idea of freedom that he was prepared to vote for the principle embodied in the Bill. 
But I can give the Hon. Nominated member, Mr. T.B.Jayah, this assurance on behalf of, I think, the vast majority, at least the Community that I represent, that in the struggle for freedom, whatever may or may not be the recommendation of the Soulbury Commission on our representation, he may rest assured that we will be quite prepared to consider any reasonable point of view that might be put forward. 
Thus the Muslims provided the required support of a two-third majority of the population, paving the way for the islands independence on 4 February 1948 when Mr. D.S.Senanayake lowered the British flag and hoisted the Sri Lankan National Flag and declared the islands independence. 
Muslims have lived in harmony with the Sinhalese and Tamils for centuries and they want to continue to do so. As stated by former Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva rightly that Muslims have been a peaceful ethnic group interacting with other religious and ethnic groups, cordially interlinking those cultures with their own culture. They never organized themselves for armed insurrection or destruction. 
They were not party to the ethnic conflict. However their sufferings were immense. 
What many conveniently forget is the crucial role played by the Muslims even in preserving the territorial integrity of the island. For example, during the early days, the Tamil militants call for a separate state had the full backing of India, and the islands armed forces were not equipped or trained, as they are today, to deal with them. 
From the very inception, Muslims throughout the country vehemently opposed calls for the division of the country and firmly stood for territorial integrity and unity. Nevertheless, they were entangled in this unfortunate and unwanted ethnic conflict only to face death, devastation, loss of properties and livelihood and displacement with no appreciation. Around 130,000 Muslims driven out from Jaffna have been still languishing in refugee camps in appalling conditions and their plight has been nobodys business for more than 20 years. 
Had the Muslims joined the Tamil militancy during its early stage the islands fate would have been sealed and the history would have projected a new political landscape. It is unfortunate that these sufferings and sacrifices have never been highlighted in their proper perspective. I am sure the Muslim community is prepared to take ten steps if the authorities take one step to take them into confidence to pave the way for cordiality and communal harmony.

Will study 'dumb deal' struck by Obama with Aussie: Trump
	
The fate of the refugee resettlement deal struck between Australia and the US last November remains uncertain as President Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday to publicly denounce the pact as a dumb deal, the International Business Times reported.
Trump took to Twitter to call the agreement a 'dumb deal.' The deal in question is regarding the transfer of approximately up to 1,250 refugees from Australias offshore detention islands of Manus Island and Nauru, including many from Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Iran and Iraq for resettlement into the US.
Trumps comments follow a Washington Post report that detailed a phone call between him and Turnbull on Saturday, which Trump described as the this was the worst call by far, compared to his interactions with four other leaders on the same day.
In the phone call that was originally planned for an hour but was then reportedly cut short abruptly after twenty-five minutes, Trump reportedly accused Australia of seeking to export the next Boston bombers and referred to the asylum seekers as illegal immigrants.
Two hours before Trumps tweet, in response to the Washington Post story, the US State Department insisted that the current administration remains committed to honour the deal.
President Trumps decision to honour the refugee agreement has not changed, a US embassy spokesperson in Canberra said in a statement, according to the Guardian.
Following the tweet, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who was asked to comment on the row said that the commitment to the deal was confirmed several times now by the [U.S.] government.
We have a clear commitment from the presidentwe expect that the commitment will continue. Turnbull told Melbourne radio station 3AW, as reported by the Guardian.
In the aftermath of the travel ban, a teenager inmate from Iran residing in the detention centre in Nauru attempted suicide by trying to hang himself at the islands processing centre and was subsequently taken by police and held in jail.
Naruru and Manus Island have been at the centre of human rights abuse accusations by those detained, including rapes, child sexual abuse and dangerous levels of sustained mental illness. The murder of one asylum seeker by guards and inadequate medical treatment leading to several other deaths as claimed by various human rights reports had also made headlines.
Do you believe it The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why I will study this dumb deal!
