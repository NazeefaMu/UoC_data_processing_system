Speaker not accepted MR as new PM: Ajith P Perera
	
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had not accepted Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the new Prime Minister, UNP MP Ajith P Perera said today.
Mr Perera therefore scoffed media reports which said Speaker had accepted the appointment and that the Premier?s Chair would be provided to Mr Rajapaksa.
?We can categorically say that Speaker has not accepted Mr Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister.
We have inquired from the Speaker?s Office and the officials there informed that no decision had been taken to provide Premier?s Chair to Mr Rajapaksa.
Earlier when asked by the Daily Mirror whether he or other UNP Seniors had spoken to the Speaker, he indicated that they had but said he couldn?t divulge any information.
?I can clearly say that the Speaker has not accepted Mr Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister,? he said. (Yohan Perera)

?Start hydrating early? - Dr. Christine Choi Kim, Skincare Expert for The Body Shop
	
City living does take a toll on skin; with its constant exposure to exhaust fumes, grubby winds, damaging UV rays from the sun, or even the air conditioning in our offices and homes. As a result, our skin becomes dehydrated, giving a tight, dry, and even dull appearance. Until there is a solution for pollution however, what can be managed is how we take control of this flaky situation.
The Body Shop comes to the rescue -yet again- with its new 100% vegan Vitamin E gel moisture cream! The latest addition to the much-loved Vitamin E family, the new lotion -true to the iconic British brand?s ethical promise- is filled with proven, safe, and highly effective all-natural ingredients filled with antioxidants to fight against the effects of time, sun-damage, and the stress that comes with being a busy and confident woman.
While it is already common knowledge that moisturisation is key to skincare, ensuring hydration is additionally important as lack of adequate water has been proven to speed up the skin?s ageing process.
?It?s never too late to start paying attention to your skin?s hydration, especially if you are prone to dry skin,? advises Dr. Christine Choi Kim, Skincare Expert for The Body Shop. ?Our cell turnover starts to slow down in our mid-20?s even if fine lines and wrinkles don?t show up until our 30s. By the time you see the first signs of ageing, you?re playing catch-up! So start hydrating early.?
The lightweight Vitamin E gel moisture cream is suitable for all skin types -even combination skin- and its non-greasy, fast-absorbing properties protects and locks-in moisture for at least two whole days. Just one application of this facial day moisturiser will leave your skin feeling -and looking! - notably refreshed, soft, and radiant. The infusion of raspberry extract will have you smelling delicious too!
The new and improved quenching formula boasts the moisture-power of 100% natural origin hyaluronic acid from Pomacle, France, teamed with the antioxidising power of wheatgerm oil - one of the richest sources of Vitamin E. Effectively mixed with community trade shea butter from Ghana infused with raspberry extract, and community trade aloe vera from Mexico, The Body Shop delivers a conscience as clear as your skin!
For best results, use the Vitamin E gel moisture cream as part of the perfect skincare regime; after cleansing with Vitamin E gentle facial wash, and paired with the Vitamin E Hydrating Toner.
Like a tall glass of water for your skin, this necessary dose of hydration deeply nourishes and protects against harsh elements without making you look or feel greasy.
The Vitamin E gel moisture cream -as well as the entire Vitamin E range- is available at The Body Shop flagship store on Bagatale Road, and outlets at Odel in Alexandra Place, and at the Kandy City Centre.

The tale of good cities - EDITORIAL
	
Yesterday, the United Nations marked World Cities Day to promote the international community?s interest in global urbanization, push forward cooperation among countries in meeting opportunities, addressing challenges of urbanization and contributing to sustainable urban development around the world.??
This year?s theme is ?Building Sustainable and Resilient Cities?. The general theme of World Cities Day is Better City, Better Life, while each year a different sub-theme is selected, to either promote successes of urbanization or address specific challenges resulting from urbanization.??
The UN says that this year it has selected the theme because cities need support to become resilient and develop their capacity to absorb the impact of hazards, protect and preserve human life and limit damage to and destruction of public and private assets while continuing to provide infrastructure and services after a crisis.? ?
UN Secretary-General Ant?nio Guterres in a message says, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement on climate change, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the New Urban Agenda together provide a road map for a more sustainable and resilient world. How our cities develop will have significant implications for realizing the future we want.??
This year?s World Cities Day focuses on resilience and sustainability. Every week, 1.4 million people move to cities. Such rapid urbanization can strain local capacities, contributing to increased risk from natural and human-made disasters. But hazards do not need to become disasters. The answer is to build resilience -- to storms, floods, earthquakes, fires, pandemics and economic crises, the UN chief says.??
According to him, cities around the world are already acting to increase resilience and sustainability. Bangkok has built vast underground water storage facilities to cope with increased flood risk and save water for drier periods. In Ecuador?s capital city of Quito, the local government has reclaimed or protected more than 200,000 hectares of land to boost flood protection, reduce erosion and safeguard the city?s freshwater supply and biodiversity. In South Africa?s Johannesburg, the city is involving residents in efforts to improve public spaces so they can be safely used for recreation, sports, community events and services such as free medical care.??
?On World Cities Day, let us be inspired by these examples. Let us work together to build sustainable and resilient cities that provide safety and opportunities for all,? the UN chief adds.? ?
In Sri Lanka, the Maithripala Sirisena - Ranil Wickremesinghe national unity government set up the Ministry of Western Province and Megapolis with the aim of making urbanisation a vital path of its vision of a just, peaceful and all-inclusive society. Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka worked out and started implementing several important projects such as the Homagama technology city where some 300 acres of state land were to be used for nanotechnology and artificial intelligence projects which would give younger generation Sri Lankans opportunities to use their creative talents and enterprising skills to start new projects. Several similar projects were also being worked out.? ?
Creativity, innovative and enterprising skills are being promoted in most countries to enable the younger generations to create a better world for the common good of all. As in any venture there are also the negative aspects. Apple boss Tim Cook, in an interview with Cable News Network (CNN) this week, warned that multi-national technology companies should take effective measures now to prevent the excessive invasion of privacy.? He warned that if effective measures were not taken immediately technology companies might have the ability to know more about ourselves than even what we know.??
While being conscious about the forbidden apple, we also need to make full use of modern technology including artificial intelligence to develop not only mega cities but also our rural areas so that the village people too would have an equal place and equal say in sustainable eco-friendly development. At the same time what we need to forbid is our leaders getting involved in hate speech or extremism which might provoke some mentally unstable people to massacre innocent people as we saw in the horrible crime at the Pittsburgh Jewish synagogue last Saturday.? ? ?

To establish justice and good governance  is the need of the hour
	
?
Statement by Mr. Imthiaz Bakeer Markar??
?
A constitution is primarily a set of rules and principles specifying how a country should be governed, how power is distributed and controlled, and what rights citizens possess. Since the 1931 Donoughmore constitution, Sri Lanka has had universal suffrage to elect its representatives in government, making us one of the oldest democracies in Asia.? ?
While many countries around the world over this time, have had coups, dictatorships and constitutional breakdowns; Sri Lanka, in spite of the Cold War, multiple youth insurrections and a 30-year old war has managed to govern itself with respect to its constitution.? ?
Without respect to a constitution to govern a country, oppression shall rule over the people.? ?
This is an historic moment in the post-independence era of Sri Lanka.??
?
This is a historic moment in the post-independence era of Sri Lanka
?
What is unfolding in front of our eyes is an unprecedented sequence of events.??
As a nation, we have a moral obligation to unite, in order to establish justice and good governance, and protect our constitution.??
Whilst appreciating the? Speaker?s strong stance to uphold democracy during this uncertain period, I have no doubt, the Speaker will reconvene Parliament, and allow the duly elected representatives of the people of Sri Lanka to decide who commands the majority of the House, in the interest of Sri Lanka, today and tomorrow.? ?
Sri Lanka has been a beacon of light in cherishing and upholding democracy in the region.? ?
I urge all Sri Lankans to rise up to the moment and reject any act of violence and acts that undermine and hinder our democracy.??
I also urge leaders of all political parties to act with utmost responsibility at this very important juncture.??
Your decisions would determine the future of Sri Lanka and will be mentioned in our history books.? ?

Trash Talk?s inspiring initiatives to clean up the country
     	 
  At the Daily Mirror, we believe that climate change is one of the greatest threats that we, as Sri Lankans, will face in the future.  Therefore, we intend to provide our readers with local and international content with the objective to educate and inspire. We would also like to learn from our valued readers about any ongoing initiatives in making Sri Lanka a more sustainable nation.   
 We aim to explore sustainable ways of living that have the most positive impact on not just our natural environment, but also for humans and animals.  
While topics such as global warming, pollution, and inequality are confronting, we believe it's time the media stopped shying away from these issues and became an active participant in finding solutions - and we hope you will join us. 
     
				 		 
	
	
?
Tuesday 23 October saw the latest Trash Talk event moderated by Ananta Sustainables to discuss ?Why Sustainability and what are the biggest challenges of the early adopters in this area???
Each organization reviewed the success of their projects over the past year and what is being planned for the future by not only already established eco-friendly companies but the ?everyday heroes? that are taking time out from their own busy lives to tackle the war on waste.?
CSR Sri Lanka ? Currently in the process of starting a project to revolutionize the waste collection and recycling industry in Sri Lanka.? By creating a membership program where people join the service and can take their recyclable waste to a designated collection return they?ll receive points based on the weight. Once they collect 1000 points members are able to exchange points for cash or sustainable products.?
Pearl Protectors ? This everyday hero organisation?s main objective is raising awareness of ocean pollution and the effects that plastic has not only on marine life, but on humans who are eating plastic filled seafood unknowingly. In the past year they?ve been doing volunteer programmes such as cleaning the oil spill at Muturajawela with the use of cloth socks to soak up the oil as well as beach clean-ups in? Wellawatta, Dehiwela and Mount Lavinia.?
Parley for the Oceans ? Instead of focusing on recycling, they are actively campaigning for the concept of A.I.R. ? Avoid, Intercept and Redesign with regards to plastic waste. Choose alternative options such as reusable cloth bags or metal straws.? Support closed loop companies and ones with strong recycling policies.? If you see plastic rubbish, clean it up or get involved in beach clean-ups. Finally, find other materials to create things instead of plastic and create policies at home and in the workplace that prevent unnecessary plastics entering the system.? On November 4 they are organising a 1000 strong beach clean-up at Crow Island with members of churches of all different faiths and welcome all to join in.
Ocean Intact ? a passionate group of students who are working to raise awareness on ocean protection in between their studies.? Starting with a small stall at The Good Market their aim is to inspire young people and teach them the dangers of plastic pollution in the hope that their parents will listen to them and also make changes in their lives.
Ananta Sustainables ? They talked about their ?trash dolphin? project in Kalpitiya.? By using donated materials and labour, they created a sculpture of a dolphin and filled it with trash from the beach in an effort to start a conversation about the plastic pollution in the area due to the hotels and the large numbers of tourists.? ? The art installation has been extremely successful in starting a conversation between local community members and they plan on adding more sculptures around the island.?
House of Lonali ? is creating premium fashion products from upcycled material such as offcuts, print rejects and cut off fabrics that would be destined for landfill.? Their portfolio includes clothing, shoes, bags and accessories that blend fashion with sustainability. They also work with big clothing companies as MAS holdings on how they successfully upcycle their own fabric waste.?
Eco360 - Chullaka Hapuarachchi was originally in the polythene plastic business but has moved into the area of biodegradable plastic bag alternatives made of starch.? Other items in the pipeline are 100% compostable coffee cups (currently coffee cups are unable to be recycled due to the plastic film on the inside of the cup). They are also creating paper straws and boxes made from sugar cane.
''The goal of the evening was to get people interested in doing something with other people and hopefully Trash Talk is the platform for them to connect? Ms. Weerasinghe from Ananta Sustainables, said and from the engagement from the audience with the speakers, it looks like the event was a roaring success.

As one of the biggest companies in the cosmetics industry with brands under their belt such as Dove, Fair and Lovely and Vaseline, Unilever has recently announced its support for a global ban on the cosmetic testing on animals.? It?s estimated a worldwide ban could save around 115 million animals from a painful death every year.? Unilever is in the unique position that they now have the chance to influence other companies by sharing with them their 30 years of research on the technology and methods for non-animal approaches for product safety testing.?

UNP gives ultimatum to President
	
Ranil Wickremesinghe and UNF MPs acknowledge supporters at the rally
?
Basking in the warmth of cheers coming from thousands of UNP supporters wearing green caps outside Temple Tress on Tuesday (October 30), deposed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe reiterated that his party would continue with the struggle to safeguard the sovereignty of Parliament and democracy.?
The protesters found many different ways to reject President Maithiripala Sirisena?s decisions ? the removal of Ranil Wickremesinghe and the hurried appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as Premier-without consulting Parliament.
?I am not here for Ranil, I am here for democracy and good governance,?
?Respect the mandate, reconvene the Parliament,? ?Dear MPs, country?s future in on your hands,?
?Dear MPs, think before you jump.?
With a pithy mix of humour, Tuesday?s protest was joined by thousands of people from Colombo and rural areas. Among the above mentioned slogans, ?I am not here for Ranil, I am here for democracy and good governance,? was the signage that went viral long after the crowds dispersed. It gained a wide circulation on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Even Wickremesinghe replied to the signage posted on Twitter saying ?And that?s okay. That is what democracy is about!?
One of the protesters told the Daily Mirror, ?I?m not a UNPer, neither am I an SLFPer. I am not a follower of any political party in Sri Lanka. I just took leave from work today and came here because I want to see a democratic Government during my lifetime. I think there are many people who feel the same way. I mean they?re just not standing out here because they want some political party to come into power and it?s not worth the time. We are here for democracy and good governance?.
The general public still remains stunned due to the dramatic turn of political events unfolding in the country at the moment including the sudden ousting of Wickremesinghe and the surprising return of Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister. Adding to the drama were the hurried appointments of politicians and selected individuals to several Government institutions; which gave rise to alarming incidents of violations of law and order.
?
A signage of protesters who had gathered at Liberty roundabout Kollupitiya
?
There were several familiar faces within the UNP, who had lost their ministerial portfolios, setting foot on a truck that served as a makeshift mobile stage.?
The Leader of the UNP Wickremesinghe, who arrived at the demonstration along with her wife Prof. Maithree Wickremesinghe, vowed to continue with administrating the present Government as soon as the Constitutional crisis is solved. He said that everyone should join in the fight against arbitrary decisions taken by the President who had disregarded the people?s mandate and betrayed those who had worked hard for his victory at the elections.
?
Going against the mandate?
?This crowd is not all UNPers. There are many citizens who took time to attend this demonstration and do what is right as Sri Lankans regardless of their political opinion, race, religion or class,? Wickremesinghe told the crowd.
He said that the UNP supported Maithripala Sirisena in 2015 for the Presidenby and that the unity Government was given a mandate in 2015 and that included establishing democracy.
He said they did not expect President Sirisena to go against the mandate given to him.
He underscored that although the President is attempting to retain his executive powers the UNP will oppose it. Sajith Premadasa, Deputy Leader of the UNP, addressing the crowd said that the mandate of the people has been plundered by the country?s President.?
Premadasa said that he would never think twice if he has to risk his life to protect the people?s mandate and the trust of the UNP voters akin to his father Former President Ranasinghe Premadasa.
Meanwhile, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, speaking in a high pitched tone said that if he could once fight against a ?notorious? leader like Mahinda Rajapaksa, taking on Maithripala Sirisena is peanuts.
Expressing his gratitude towards the UNPers who attended the demonstration despite the short notice given, Fonseka said they would never let President Sirisena go back on the promises he had made to the people and commence a new political journey following a personal agenda.
?
Army deserter?
He also touched on the assassination plot associated with the President and Former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa. ?They have found a random army deserter to fabricate a story about an assassination plot. It seems like this army deserter is now working as the Head of Intelligence Service of Maithripala Sirisena,? said Fonseka.
Wickramabahu Karunarathne was a prominent politician who took to the UNP stage, demanding justice.
?The entire civil society supports us and demands democracy,? he said issuing a warning and took the opportunity to convey to the President that they would be compelled to seize the President?s House unless Parliament is reconvened without further delay.
Ven. Dambara Amila Thera who supported the good governance campaign, said that the country is trapped internationally due to mounting pressure coming from the international community. The Thera warned that the country would have to face economic sanctions if law and order continues to be violated.
?
?
Ravi Karunanayake spoke about the injustices he has faced within his grand old party. However he said that he had decided to put the issues aside and support the party during this difficult time.
?Now is the time to unite. Now is the time to show our support to the party,? Karunanayake said.
Former Minister Rajitha Senaratne said, ?The international community has warned that Sri Lanka would become a ?pariah state?, if this fake Government continues. During a meeting between Prime Minister and the diplomatic community, a warning had been given to the President that economic sanctions and the cancellation of GSP facilities might have to be expected if the turmoil in the country remains unsolved.?
Meanwhile, politician Harin Fernando for the second time apologised to UNP supporters for making Maithripala Sirisena the President.?
He told the gathering, ?It was we who brought you into power, and it will be we who will also send you home?.
In a shocking revelation, actor turned politician MP Ranjan Ramanayake said that several UNP MPs had sold themselves in favour of millions of rupees infamously given by China to strengthen the hands of Mahinda Rajapaksa.
UNP Parliamentarian Ajith. P. Perera, who made the final speech at the rally, said that the President would be given an ultimatum till Friday (November 2) to convene Parliament; if not the UNP would resort to further actions.

UNP, UPFA in race against time time to win over MPs
	
President Maithripala Sirisena sprang a surprise last Friday (October 26)? by dismissing UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe from the premiership and appointing his erstwhile colleague Mahinda Rajapaksa to the post.? It led to a constitutional tussle which is making international news headlines.??
Amidst calls from various quarters to convene Parliament and test the person claiming to have the majority support to be the Prime Minister, the UNP and the UPFA are in a rigorous exercise to lure MPs to prove? ?their strength in the House when it will meet on November 16 after prorogation.?
?
Both try to woo TNA MPs
	TNA set to be neutral
?
During the past four weeks, we discussed the political developments that eventually climaxed following the swearing in of a new Prime Minister.? In fact, we reported it under the headline ?Yahapalana regime at breaking point? in our edition published on October 4. We discussed at length how the rift between the President and the Prime Minister widened.? Let us now discuss how things would unfold next!?
The 2015 parliamentary elections sent 105 members to Parliament on the UNP ticket, and the UPFA 95.? ?Numerically speaking, the UPFA, after the game of power change, now commands the support of 101 MPs as five UNPers and EPDP MP Douglas Devananda were sworn in the? ?new Government of Mahinda Rajapaksa.?
Be that as it may, the UNP led by Wickremesinghe is in relentless pursuit to initiate crossovers from the other side to muster the required number to remain in office.?
The Tamil National Alliance (TNA), which is the main opposition of Parliament with 16 parliamentarians on its roll, has been the focus of attention by both Wickremesinghe and Rajapaksa in their race against time to win over as many MPs as possible.
TNA Leader R. Sampanthan, a seasoned Tamil politician, called on President Sirisena, Wickremesinghe and Rajapaksa after the change and discussed the latest developments in politics.?
Above all, his audience with the new Prime Minister acquired significance as a novel political development because there were scant political relations between the two during the past three and half years.
Sampanthan made representation to Rajapaksa at his residence in Wijerama Mawatha, Colombo 7 on Tuesday.? Former Minister Prof. G.L. Peiris too was present at the meeting. There were candid expressions of views at this meeting.
Afterwards, Mr. Sampanthan summoned the parliamentary group of his party and apprised them of what he had learned from his interactions with these three leaders in terms of the unfolding political developments.
First, he said that the President was gravely perturbed and hurt over the alleged assassination attempt on him.?
According to political sources, he moved on next to brief what transpired at his meeting with Rajapaksa.?
Sampanthan reportedly asked for a commitment from Rajapaksa to offer a constitutional solution to what he called ?the Tamil national question?. For that purpose, he tried to secure commitment from Rajapaksa to offer a solution in line with the power devolution package worked out by the Government of former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga in 2000.?
Rajapaksa also served in that Government in 2000. As such Sampanthan might have assumed that there was no reason for Rajapaksa to oppose any solution based on that package.? Nonetheless, Rajapaksa responded forthwith saying that he had no mandate for such a pledge to be made as a condition to accommodate the TNA on board.?
The Daily Mirror learns that Sampanthan? ?had promised Rajapaksa that he would opt to remain neutral in Parliament.?
Also, Sampanthan is reported to have said that Tamils were deceived for 30-40 years by the successive Governments and therefore they should not be made fools of once again. By saying so, he tried to secure a firm commitment from Rajapaksa.
Jaffna District MP M.A. Sumanthiran was the only TNA legislator to have reservations about his party doing anything advantageous for Rajapaksa.? Sumanthiran? ?asked how Rajapaksa could be trusted going by his past conduct as far as the issues connected to Tamils were concerned. Let alone, most TNA MPs, having weighed ground politics in the south, opined that Rajapaksa should not be antagonised any further as otherwise it would be impossible to get anything done by him in the future.? ??
Also, Sampanthan told the meeting that? ?the Sinhala people would not oppose? ?if Rajapaksa offered any solution to issues concerning the Tamils.?
Among the political parties, only the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) has formally announced that it would not support anyone in Parliament on the formation of a Government.? ?In that context, the TNA has a crucial role to play.? But, the TNA?s support will be of little value if? Rajapaksa? ?engineers a mass exodus from the UNP and secured a simple majority of 113 MPs or more.? The same will happen to the TNA if the UNP secured a simple majority with enough crossovers from the UPFA.? Anyway, a mass exodus from either party is a remote possibility. Therefore,? ?it is learned that the UNP and the UPFA are approaching the TNA MPs individually to woo them.?
?
Namal?s endearment with TNA MPs
Already, the Prime? Minister?s son Namal has reached some TNA legislators individually and asked for support.? It is reported that young Rajapaksa has befriended some TNA members so much so that he addresses them ?Machan?, a term of endearment.
The UNP is also in a move to win over the TNA legislators on an individual basis. So, the TNA gains in importance in Parliament under the current political climate. But, for them, it is not an easy decision to support the UNP once again.?
The President?s sacking of the Prime Minister appears to have met with stiff resistance from the western world.? In the immediate aftermath of the? ?appointment of a new Prime Minister, European Union, along with like-minded countries such as Norway and Canada, issued a statement.
It said that? ? that the Ambassador of the European Union, as well as the Ambassadors of France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania and the UK High Commissioner, are closely following the events unfolding in Sri Lanka.
They asked all parties to fully act in accordance with Sri Lanka?s constitution and to refrain from violence, to follow due institutional process and to respect the independence of institutions and the freedom of media.
However, the President stood for constitutionality of his action in the removal of Wickremesinghe from office? ?amidst counter arguments by the UNP, its leaders and some civil society leaders that the move was unlawful. They all called for convening Parliament, so that the two persons claiming to be the Prime Ministers could contest their strength in terms of the number of MPs sitting with them at the moment.?
On Monday, the President briefed the diplomatic community in Colombo to clarify his position and to answer questions raised in regards to the legality of his action in sacking the Prime Minister.?
?
Prez quotes two Presidential Counsel??
At this briefing, the heads of diplomatic missions of European Union and the like-minded countries expressed their concern regarding the ?ongoing constitutional crisis?. They urged all concerned to convene Parliament.
In response to the western ambassadors who raised questions, the President argued for constitutionality of his action quoting interpretations from two President?s Counsel.?
The western diplomats said they were worried about the prospect of rising violence, intimidation and threats.? That was an obvious reference to the shooting incident at the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation on Sunday.
In his response, the President said such political violence had dropped in Sri Lanka as per statistics from 2001. He said he would take measures to deescalate violence if any.??
Reconciliation process won?t be derailed? The western diplomatic heads had another? ?fear that the reconciliation, reform and transitional justice process would be derailed.? Obviously, they feared that such things could not be achieved under the premiership of Rajapaksa. So, they questioned about it.
In trying to allay their fears, the President said, ?Look at me for those things! I will ensure that these will not be derailed,?
Also, the President said that his sacking of the Prime Minister was well in line with the principles of good governance.? He told the briefing that most Cabinet tender deals were not transparent at that time. And, he said it prompted him to take this action eventually.?
?Actually, 75 percent of our people are happy with what I did,? he said.?
The western countries look perturbed over the change of premiership according to the tone and tenor of their collective voice.??

Will launch massive TU action against Prez?s decision: Wickramabahu
	
Nava Sama Samaja Party Leader Wickramabahu Karunaratne said yesterday they would launch a massive trade union action and a riot in protest of President?s decision to remove Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister and proroguing Parliament unconstitutionally.
He told a news conference that the country had plunged into a serious crisis and requested the President to restore democracy in the country by convening Parliament immediately.
?President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa were acting against the Constitution disregarding Parliament. We consider this a political coup,? he said.
He said Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapaksa was the legal expert behind this and said he was clever at twisting the law. (Nimala Kodituwakku)

Best friend and a great personality
	
?In the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures. For in the dew of little things the heart finds its morning and is refreshed.?
Khalil Gibran??
?
My association with Dakshitha Thalgodapitiya began when both of us were at Ananda College. That was an eon ago, so to speak. Dakshitha entered Ananda as a migrant from St. Anne?s Kurunegala while I just had to move, more or less, across the road from Nalanda College. As was the practice then, most of us were known at school by our last name. That?s how our teachers used to address us, by our last name- so did we, our schoolmates. Dakshitha was known by his nickname, Thal, a shortened one for his Kandyan last name. Even then Dakshitha was never short of flamboyancy. The ease with which he made friends with total strangers was astounding and exemplary. Other students at the time, especially the shy kind like me, often wondered what made the man make friends so easily. Dakshitha was no shy guy.??
His participation in the English debating team at Ananda was memorable. Ananda College was known to be among the elite of schools in Colombo. Royal, S. Thomas?, St. Peter?s and St. Joseph?s were presumed to be ranked much higher than Ananda in the category of ?English-speaking? schools. With arrogance, condescending demeanour and sheer disregard for anything steeped in Sinhalese-Buddhist traditions, they honestly believed, that their schools were a shade above the rest of the country. These derelicts of a colonial era yet endured a delusional fantasy of ?pukka sahibs? and continued on their delusional journey of ?colonial superiority? without trying to cause any change from a colonial time to time of ?Independence. But Ananda, Nalanda, Dharmaraja in Kandy, Mahinda in Galle and the rest of the country chose to flow with the cascade of change. The irony is we didn?t realize it at the time. Maybe we weren?t intellectually ripened enough to understand the nuances of these exclusively discriminatory notions of elitism and non-elitism.??
Nevertheless, we, as young high school students, felt the effects of this utterly destructive dynamic of elitism among leading secondary schools in Colombo and other big city centres that manifested themselves on the platforms of inter-school debates. Ananda?s debating at the time was no second to any of these so-called English-style schools. One of those who shone in English debating during the time in school was my friend, Dakshitha Thalgodapitiya.??
His attacking spirit was evident not only in his day-to-day mingling with his peers, it was more pronounced on the debating stage. Dakshitha did not let his team down and that quality of being an excellent team player was even more prevalent in his professional career right through. To be simultaneously placed in charge of three government institutions, Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (LRDC), River Valleys Development Board (RVDB) and Lanka Machine and Lease Company (LMC) - all three being engineering-dominant corporations despite Thalgodapitiya being an accountant by profession- speaks volumes for the confidence the then Minister Gamini Dissanayake had on the youthful shoulders of the man. Added to that distinguished honour of being simultaneously responsible for three corporations, the age at which young Dakshitha (in his early thirties) held these critically responsible billets spoke volumes for his prowess as an up and coming executive the likes of whom one usually finds only in the private sector.??
?
Ananda?s debating at the time was no second to any of these so-called English-style schools. One of those who shone in English debating during the time in school was my friend, Dakshitha Thalgodapitiya
?
There is no dispute about Dakshitha?s capacity as a CEO. He did not have a match in the public sector at the time. Yet Dakshitha had some weaknesses. No man is perfect. So was Dakshitha Thalgodapitiya. His indulgences were well known among his close friends and sometimes these friends had to advise and warn him against such extravagances. Dakshitha willingly chose to live on the fringes. By not occupying the middle ground, he, more often than not, had to be extricated from the fringes by his friends many a time. But the man?s heart was a huge one. As much as his loyalty to his alma mater knew no bounds, his propensity to take risks and go where no public servant had dared to make him unique and sometimes controversial.??
His did care for those who were in need of such care. With special allegiance to his alma mater, Ananda, there were some occasions on which he helped many a hapless and helpless unemployed youth find gainful employment. Quite versatile in his conversational and negotiating skills, he put such talents to good use in order to win business opportunities for the institutions he worked for. After retiring from government service, he continued to be a Board Member of the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) of which he was the most senior member until he passed away. His father, an old boy of Trinity College, Kandy, who breathed his last at the ripe old age of ninety nine (99) was a Divisional Revenue Officer (DRO) and his younger brother himself, a Management Accountant, is one of the most successful teachers of the profession.??
Oscar Wilde once said thus: ?we are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars?. Dakshitha Thalgodapitiya chose to be one of the very few that believed anything was possible. He chose to focus on what you can do, not on what hasn?t already happened. That was how he treated his dreaded malignancy. A man who loved life and living ultimately had to face humanity?s great equalizer, death. He?ll be remembered by his friends and foes for his love for life and living. Being a victim of some of his own exigencies, Dakshitha lived a full life, albeit sixty eight (68) years, is young in the context of present day?s relative age. One friend of his described him as ?one sitting on the cutting edge of a knife and consuming himself?.? ?
All of us will have to reach the end of our journey of life. Along the way we meet many a foe and many a friend. But one must be exceptionally blessed to come across a friend like Dakshitha Thalgodapitiya. He succumbed to an illness for which no cure or cause has been found. The way he met his death, fighting to his last breath, ever so appraised of current affairs ranging from cricket, medicinal values of fruits and vegetables, foreign affairs to politics, was nothing short of marvellous. A fighter had to give up ultimately to life?s equalizer.? ?
May he attain Nibbana!??

## Title: Can Sirisena  be so fragile?
## Section: Opinion
## Date: 1 November 2018 12:43 am
Can Sirisena  be so fragile?
	
?
Sri Lanka?s political crisis gives us a window to view it in two ways. The first affords us the opportunity to see whether the country?s leader was strong to hold his nerve and quell the opposition forces out to destroy him. In this count Sirisena failed miserably. He panicked as the UNP forces moved away from him. An isolated Sirisena forged ties with ousted former president Mahinda Rajapaksa to cling on to power.?
The other school of thought is that Sirisena did the right thing by joining with Rajapaksa because that move is termed as one that?s patriotic. The Sinhala-Buddhist nationalists consider it as a wise move because this saved the country from the UNP machinery, which the opposition claims, was selling the country?s vital assets to foreign countries.?
?
But what can?t be debated is the fact that all who threw their weight behind the protest loved democracy and fair play
	Sirisena is still the president and must remember that it was unbecoming of him to pour out his sorrows like a child
	The UNP is mulling over bringing an impeachment on Sirisena
?
If the country?s citizenry is all smiles now, President Sirisena would be sporting a bigger smile because he knows that he cleared one hurdle; now he doesn?t have to deal with Ranil Wickremesinghe. That is one headache that?s over for him. But whether he has the wit and the thinking power to get the best out of the ?deal? he has had with Rajapaksa is the big question.?
The continual rift between him and Wickremesinghe, the pressure from India and the much publicised assassination plot associated with his life proved too much for a man who certainly doesnt have the makings to be a political animal. The president joining hands with the opposition underscored how fragile he is in the face of adversity.?
?
Advisers?
The president?s speech on television during which he told the nation why he invited Rajapaksa to be the premier lacked emotion, drive and the punch of a man in the hot seat of politics. Sirisena is still the president and must remember that it was unbecoming of him to pour out his sorrows like a child. He said during the speech that Wickremesinghe grossly violated the Yahapalana Government?s principles apart from stubbornly avoiding collective decision making. Wickremesinghe has denied these allegations however. Srisena?s decision making also questions the input he receives from his advisers. Can?t Sirisena fathom that he created enemies among his own SLFPers when he termed up with National Movement for Social Justice before the 2015 Presidential Elections? Doesn?t he see that the situation now is even worse because he has shown his back to the forces who propelled him to be the first citizen of the country? If this arrangement too fails where would Sirisena go?
Many still believe that Rajapaksa would take his revenge on Sirisena for ousting him, but the former President has vouched that his Government would eschew politics of hate and set up an interim regime. This is yet another lifeline for Rajapaksa in his political career. What will stand in good stead for him is that the Governors of all provinces have promised support for him, and also president Sirisena.?
?
Like in JVP organised rallies, the protesters in Colombo were seen collecting the trash they spilled on the roads before they left. These acts also show the stature of people backing democracy
?
President Sirisena when teaming up with Rajapaksa could see the outside world turning hostile towards Sri Lanka. Right now he has prorogued Parliament and attracted the wrath of the international community. Proroguing parliament is so undemocratic. The ousting of Wickremesinghe as premier is considered unconstitutional by the outside world. If this situation continues in the island, the world community could impose trade embargoes on Sri Lanka. This would prove disastrous for Sri Lanka given the heavy debt commitment the country has to clear.?
The UNP is mulling over bringing an impeachment on Sirisena. On Tuesday (October 30) Wickremesinghe loyalists together with promoters of democracy came in their numbers to stage a protest in Colombo. There are differences of opinion about whether the number of people who gathered at the rally was big or small. But what can?t be debated is the fact that all who threw their weight behind the protest loved democracy and fair play. Like in JVP organised rallies, the protesters in Colombo were seen collecting the trash they spilled on the roads before they left. These acts also show the stature of people backing democracy, leave alone supporting Wickremesinghe.?
The rally was in support of Wickremesinghe to be allowed to continue as Premier. Some legal experts say that Parliament must lose confidence in the Prime Minister to remove him and that Articles 46 and 48 of the Constitution clearly show how Parliament can remove a prime minister. But there are others who form their opinions by quoting Article 46 (4) and state that when Cabinet is dissolved it warrants the removal of the premier.?
The chaos that exists in the country forced people to buy petrol in advance, giving rise to long queues at filling stations. People also mulled over whether they should indulge in the panic buying of groceries fearing the situation could worsen. There was a large drop in attendance at work places and at schools on Monday (October 29).?
Right now the Rajapaksa machinery is hellbent on ?buying over? people to have a minimum requirement regarding the strength of the Cabinet. Some legal experts state that the moment the UPFA exited the coalition, the National Government ceased to exist. Therefore they say there can?t be a constitutional Cabinet of Ministers numbering over 30. Apart from this, legal experts say that now its up to the newly appointed Premier to go to parliament and show the numbers.?
?
can?t be fooled?
We now live in an era where the trend of the youth is towards education. Most of the children of owners of small tea kiosks, village farmers and less affluent clerical staffers at Government institutes are armed with degrees and wish for a better Sri Lanka. These youth can?t be fooled and they?ve had enough of this nonsense of new Cabinets being formed with the same old faces in the political sphere who are termed as spent forces.?
But these educated youth will have opposition from those of their same age who showcase the little knowledge they have about life and the future. The latter do so by serving milk rice on the roads to celebrate the return of politicians in the likes of Rajapaksa. Did these people, who served milk rice on the roads, ever think that this chaotic situation in the country could create a food shortage, hence they should not indulge in wasteful habits??
Sirisena must seriously consider that he betrayed the 62 lakhs of voters who cast their votes for a change in 2015. The president is still able use state television and address the nation, but can he do that now onwards with a mike at hand at a public platform in the presence of a large and boisterous crowd?

Celebrate compassion for World Vegan Day !
     	 
  At the Daily Mirror, we believe that climate change is one of the greatest threats that we, as Sri Lankans, will face in the future.  Therefore, we intend to provide our readers with local and international content with the objective to educate and inspire. We would also like to learn from our valued readers about any ongoing initiatives in making Sri Lanka a more sustainable nation.   
 We aim to explore sustainable ways of living that have the most positive impact on not just our natural environment, but also for humans and animals.  
While topics such as global warming, pollution, and inequality are confronting, we believe it's time the media stopped shying away from these issues and became an active participant in finding solutions - and we hope you will join us. 
     
				 		 
	
	
Vegans and the vegan-curious around the world unite today on November 1 for World Vegan Day.? Originally created in 1994 as a way of commemorating the 50th anniversary of the UK Vegan Society, it has now become a day for people to celebrate the joys of being vegan, while being able to share the lifestyle with friends and family in events stretched across the globe.??
But why do people go vegan?
While each individual?s reasons and experiences give them different motivation there is usually four main deciders.
1. Against animal cruelty:? Everyone knows that the killing of animals for food and clothing is a nasty business, there would hardly be a person who says they enjoy it.? What most people don?t realise is that many animals also die as by-products of the dairy/egg industry, animal testing, tourism and entertainment.
2. Environment:? Animal agriculture is one of the biggest causes of:
Carbon emissions?
	Deforestation to graze cattle or to grow soya beans to feed animals
	Water pollution due to pesticides and animal manure run off from farms
	Water use ? it takes a huge amount of water to keep animals alive?
	With the news of the recent UN report that we need to cap the earth?s rising temperature at no more than 1.5 degrees, recommendations are that people cut their meat and dairy consumption to help combat climate change.
3. Health:? Vegans are less likely to have diabetes, heart disease and certain types of cancers and many will say they have improved sleep, skin and energy levels. There are great scientifically backed websites such as The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (https://www.pcrm.org/) and also Dr Michael Greger, the author behind the book, How Not To Die. (https://nutritionfacts.org/ ) - both have infinite resources on why a vegan diet can be beneficial to human health.??
4. Religion: While you can find vegans of all faiths across the planet, the only religion that requires complete vegetarianism or veganism is Jainism.? ?Other ancient Indian religions such as Buddhism and Hinduism also have scriptures and religious authorities that do encourage veganism but it?s not observed by most although a large majority of Hindus are vegetarian. The Christian Seventh Day Adventists promote a vegetarian diet but this is based more on healthy living, rather than the ethics of animal killing and the concept of ahimsa (non-violence).
What you can do to celebrate World Vegan Day in Sri Lanka?
Take a pledge to go vegan for the day/week/month?
	Have a potluck where each person brings a delicious plant-based meal to share.?
	Watch an animal documentary online such as Earthlings, Forks Over Knives, What the Health or Cowspiracy.
	Visit one of the vegan cafes around Sri Lanka and enjoy a burger, pizza, even brownies ? you?ll find a detailed list on where to get the best eats on the Happy Cow restaurant guide website.
	Donate to an animal welfare-based organisation or even better, volunteer at a shelter!?
Mirror for Hope spoke to some vegans in Sri Lanka to find out what World Vegan Day means to them.
Arjuna De Silva - ?Spreading compassion and being harmless towards all living beings - living a guilt free life means everything to me?
Meredith Tanner ? ?For me, it?s a celebration. A chance to gather and connect with other vegans, celebrating our beautiful lifestyle, while also sharing with non-vegans how delicious and amazing veganism truly is. Becoming vegan absolutely transformed my life, and to share and celebrate this transformation with others is very special to me?
Margriet Hospers ? ?World Vegan Day for me is about highlighting how to approach all aspects of life holistically. From the earth we walk on to how we live using that same soil.?
Deebika Sh ?World Vegan Day is to celebrate compassion and love towards fellow beings, animals and the Earth and to encourage a cruelty free lifestyle.?
Mariette Hathor ? ?Compassion towards my own body and nurturing my presence on Earth. Compassion towards all around me, fellow humans, animals and creatures and Mother Earth who gives life to all?.

CHILD TURNED CHAPERONE 8-year old Dinara toils to look after her ailing mother, sister
	
?
While young children of her age are playing and freely enjoying beauty and the glamour of the nature in the village, an eight-year old little girl, Dinara Sandakalani in the same village in Lunugamvehera devotes her entire time after school to do the household chores of her family and attend to the needs of her disabled mother and her 4-year old younger sister.? ?
Mother of this family J.M. Ramani (35) having three children is suffering from conditions developed with injuries on her leg when she was bitten by a serpent in 2014. She is still under medication after an operation done for the snakebite.? ?
?
She says they have to spend about Rs.2,000 for medicine at a time and it is very difficult for the family to spend such an amount for treatment amidst the other needs of the children. While living among all these difficulties Ramani also has begun to experience a gradually growing weakness of eyesight. The parents have dedicated their eldest child to the temple for ordination, the other two children aged eight and four are living with the mother. ? ?
?
After returning from school, little Dinara, a grade 5 student at Kudagammana Vidyalaya, in Lunugamwehera,becomes busy preparing meals, feeding her mother and looking after her younger sibling. Occasionally this little girl stays away from school whenever her partially visually impaired mother needs special attention or to bathe her. Ramani?s husband does odd jobs to survive the family and spends most of his earnings. In search of more money to treat his ailing wife, he moved to Colombo to find better employment.
?
This family has no proper abode. Ramani said former Housing Development Minister Sajith Premadasa granted them a plot of land and loan to build a house. However, they were told by the Housing Development Authority that they would face legal action for not settling the loan arrears of Rs.29,000.? ?
?
?
Meanwhile, Ramani had also been advised to undergo a surgery to cure her fading eyesight, for which they have to spend Rs 1.5 million.?
?
Therefore, the family looks for philanthropists to assist them to come out of this pathetic situation. The family resides at No.52/1, Kuda Gammana Paha, Lunugamvehera, and for more information they can be reached on 0713892655

Creativity can flourish even in prison
	
?For to be free is not merely to cast off one?s chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others??
Nelson Mandela
A prison is a place where criminals and wrongdoers are detained. Being imprisoned is the worst experience which one ever enjoys in ones lifespan. It sounds odd when it is said that prison is also a place where inmates can master their talents. We have recorded instances where the above mentioned facts has come to light.? ?
?Sira Nowu Sithuwam? an exhibition of arts organized by the Department of Prisons becomes an incentive for inmates to make the worst place to be the best place to brush up their talent of art. This exhibition is held annually in line with the Prisoners? Welfare Day which falls on September 12. Holding an event like this relieves the minds of the prisoners whose minds are in fact engulfed with anxiety and despair. The cell can limit their movements but can?t limit ideas from moving.??
For the year 2018, the exhibition was held on September 16 at the J.D.A. Perera Gallery of the University of the Visual & Performing Arts under the patronage of Commissioner General of Sri Lanka Prisons, Nishan Danasinghe.? ?
The exhibition which was held under two categories such as Canvas Pictures and Paper Pictures, was adorned with nearly 500 pictures drawn by the hands of the inmates from across the country.??
The noteworthy fact is that Prisons Department had also organized an award ceremony on the following day in order to admire the work done by the inmates. The first, the second and the third place received cash cheques worth Rs, 100,000, Rs. 7,500 and Rs.6,000 respectively.? ?
Accordingly, the first and the second places under the Canvas Pictures category were both won by an inmate of the Anuradhapura Prison while the third place went to an inmate of the Dumbara prison.??
The first place under the Paper Pictures category was won by an inmate of the Welikada Prison while both the second and third places were won by two inmates of the Kuruwita Prison.? ?
The award ceremony was graced with the participation of Secretary to the Ministry of Justice & Prison Reforms W.M.M.R. Adikari, Director of the Department of Cultural Affairs Anusha Gokula Fernando and several artistes.??
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Commissioner of Prisons (Rehabilitation) Chandana Ekanayake said the purpose of organizing an event like this was to boost the talents of the inmates.??
?The pictures drawn by them contained the feelings that they cannot pronounce by words. It is true that the inmates are in a tremendous pressure because they are away from their?loved ones.??
?I presume the best format to express one?s idea is art. That?s exactly we witnessed when we observed their artwork carefully. We saw as to how the drawings signified the feelings like loneliness, injustice, anxiety and despair etc,? Ekanayake shared.??
?The inmate who had won the first place had drawn his picture in order to show the difficulties that his family is undergoing at the absence of his presence.? He said they would provide the opportunity for the general public in future to have access to buy?those artwork.??
?The Department has organized to arrange workshops on professional drawings so that the inmates would get the privilege to develop their skills and talent of art,? Ekanayake added.? ?
In conclusion, it should be noted that inmates should be given the opportunities of entertainment and recreation so that they would spend their life in prison in a more worthwhile manner. Do not forget that at the end of the day, they all are human beings. They may be physically confined to a cell but their ideas are beyond the cell.?

Crisis of a tinkered Constitution Need a people?s mandate, not a head count of jumping frogs!
	
The constitutions drafted by the so-called People?s representatives? do not express the real aspirations of the people.?
Who is a Prime Minister?? An ancient British Monarch with German origins, and who did not speak English needed an interpreter to translate his addresses to the board of Ministers. He chose one among them who knew both the languages for the purpose and named him ?PRIME MINISTER?. It was in April 1721 that Sir Robert Walpole assumed as First Lord of the treasury and de facto first Prime Minister.
Writing to Daily Mirror of September 26, 2016 under, ?How effective is Parliament???former, Secretary to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Serious Acts of Fraud and Corruption (PRECIFAC) and senior public servant with 30 years of experience at Parliament, Mr Lacile de Silva says, ?Parliaments in the past few decades have been weak, ineffective and neglected. Modernisation and reforms in Parliament therefore are long overdue. In order to achieve a tangible progress, may I say, good governance should be built by developing quality institutions. The Parliament, which was simply an appendage of the executive, became a ?rubber stamp?. A political analyst has said that ?It is accountability which is fundamental to a democratic system?. Any acts of the Government are in the final analysis, acts of citizens themselves through their representatives.?
The President has prorogued Parliament until November 16. He announced the decision while dethroned Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was addressing a news conference where he asserted that he could show his majority in the House, adding to a mounting political crisis. The act is expected to give Mahinda Rajapaksa (MR)? time to gather sufficient support to endure a no-confidence vote. Anxiety and rift between Sirisena and Wickremesinghe have been building for some time. Sirisena did not approve of some of the economic restructuring which was introduced by Wickremesinghe. Sirisena also had serious concerns over the investigations into military officers accused of Human Rights (HR) violations during Sri Lanka?s civil war. The excitement of a ?bloodless revolution? in the voters on the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe Government that assumed power in January 2015, soon began to evaporate. Despite a few key democratic reforms, the Unity Government failed miserably in all other areas including the task of? punishing alleged ?criminals? in the previous regime, one of the key promises on which it came to power. Instead corruption within its own ranks marred at highest levels, starting with the Central Bank?s Billion Rupee scam by Ranil?s friend and Singapore citizen Arjuna Mahendran, which followed a series of corrupt deals involving millions, if not Billions of the poor man?s money.?
Unlike the former Presidents, Sirisena cannot dissolve Parliament at his whim and fancy like CBK did in 2004 when she sent home Ranil Wickremasinghe prematurely. The President?s hands are tied by 19A . Are some Politicians who have been talking of creating two States now attempting to make a bid to create Two Prime Ministers? The fear of being condemned by nationalist elements should also not make legislators ignore progressive steps that will go beyond the provisions in the existing Constitution.?
Taking into account the eventful past six days in Sri Lanka we need to look back and consider the gains that have been achieved during the past years as it attempts to go ahead with a badly tinkered Constitution and a difficult Constitution building process that could decide whether the country would continue as a peaceful nation. Four years ago President Rajapaksa appeared unbeatable. Cracks appeared in his popularity at the latter stages, but nobody thought they would be broad enough to make the Common Candidate win. They were proven wrong when Sirisena, who defected unceremoniously and won with a majority of more than 400,000 votes. The voters of Sri Lanka made a decision to lift the country from the brink of unprecedented corruption and intolerance.? It was an historic occasion where people displayed electoral intelligence.??
?
The 1978 Constitution?
The 1978 Constitution is ill-defined and vague?with several inconsistencies in English and Sinhala versions too. Big Western nations like Great Britain [based on traditions with no written document], USA, Australia and Canada and haven?t changed their respective constitutions since the introduction of their legislatures. They hardly had any problems in the process of the smooth implementation of their political systems.?
?
UNP?s Dilemma
What will happen if Parliament meets and passes a No-confidence Motion on the new Government, with the Government itself supporting? They will go for early elections while the UNP as usual will again face a crisis regarding leadership. The Deputy Leader and his supporters have already made some interesting comments concerning the future of the party. Nobody knows how to shatter the vicious circle or catch 22 situation of? ?Gedara Giyoth Ambu Nasee- Maga Hitiyoth umba Nasee? [either you will die if you stop on the way or your wife will die if you go home].??
The Manifesto of the United Front of the SLFP, LSSP and the CP under Sirimavo in 1970 stated, ?We seek your mandate to permit the members of Parliament you elect to function simultaneously as a Constituent Assembly to draft, adopt and operate a new Constitution. This Constitution will declare Ceylon to be a free, sovereign and independent Republic pledged to realise the objectives of a socialist democracy; and it will also secure fundamental rights and freedoms to all citizens.?
The 1972 Constitution lasted only a six-year-term. The second republican Constitution of 1978, drafted by H W Jayewardene QC, the brother of President J R Jayewardene, made some key changes to it ? it created a powerful executive presidency,? with centralised political power, a constitutionalised a free economy and set up Provincial Councils via the Thirteenth Amendment. But certain fundamental features of the 1972 constitution that define the republic, such as the unitary state, the foremost place for Buddhism remained intact.??
?
Good Governance through Constitution?
It is a matter for Sri Lankan citizens to decide on if the tinkering with the Constitution in the past has brought any good governance in relation to improving ethnic relations. It is also doubtful if future tinkering with the Constitution would pull off anything better. We are trying to amend or introduce a new Constitution for the umpteenth time with the hope that this time around it will offer us with good governance. Do constitutions help achieve good governance? I do not believe so; good governance is something deeper than a written document passed by Parliament. The fundamentals of good governance are based on the goodwill of man towards his fellow beings. Without this goodwill among different communities, constitutional tinkering will only aggravate inter communal tensions and will not deliver good governance. The constitutions drafted by the so-called People?s representatives? do not express the real aspirations of the people. The drafting of a new constitution should be monitored by society at large; let?s call it? ?People?s Committee on the Constitution.? This committee should comprise men of national reputation and of the uppermost rank in the intellectuals.? When men of this quality unite upon such a responsibility the powers of political authority could be minimised.?
Parliament can sit as a Constitutional Assembly only to formulate the basic proposals.? Nepal has also tinkered with the Constitution making a mockery of it, even sacrificing economic opportunities in an exercise that produced a deep political crisis. Sri Lanka?s attempt at Constitution drafting has to be communicated clearly to the members of civil society and the people. Let?s resolve to start building up a new political culture free of corruption and violence against humanity, which needs more and more civil society?s involvement in the process. Only through a collective effort, we can ward off all kind of accusations against our great nation. Once we set a model good for governance the hostilities, both domestic and external will also end.
Let the Constitutional interpretations take ther proper course; we are no legal experts on article 42 [a] 42 [b]; 48.3 and rest of them. The top legal luminary is already divided in their opinion on what the constitution means by ??in the President?s opinion, is most likely to command the confidence of Parliament?? though some laymen attempt to add their two cents worth.?
Some progressive clauses in the existing Constitution against corruption, hate speech and other types of extremism are habitually ignored by parliamentarians, state authorities, law enforcement officials and in the judicial process too. The proposals put forward by ?Citizen?s Movement For Good Governance [CIMOGG] headed by Dr A C Visvalingam would be an ideal foundation for a draft that could build a genuinely peaceful Sri Lanka.? ??

?I disclosed in Parliament that Mr Rajapakshe was trying to sweep the Avant-Garde case under the carpet. I also told the people in Maharagama not to vote for him as his heart was with Mr Mahinda Rajapaksa. Therefore what I have said about him had come true,? Fonseka said.
He refuted the statement made by President Maithripala Sirisena that North and East were to be merged.
?There was never such a move; no one has even spoken about merging the Northern Province and the Eastern Province,? he said
Responding to a question on the allegation that China was behind the current situation he said he did not think so.(Yohan Perera)

I won't stay even one hour if Ranil comes back: Prez
	
President Maithripala Sirisena has said that he would neither let the North and East to be merged nor allow the country to be a federal state.
He told the SLFP electoral organizers who met him in Colombo that he would have to be killed to get those two done.
The President has told the organizers that some groups had been adamant about the merger of the North and East and the formation of a federal state.
He has said he would not remain as President even for an hour if Ranil Wickremesinghe was reappointed the Prime Minister.
The President has said that he took a bold decision after winning the Presidential election on January 8, 2015 and that the steps he took today were even stronger and that he did so thinking of the country.
He has said that a secretary of the UNP had delivered him a letter after winning the Presidential election in 2015, which contained the need to appoint Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister and transfer powers vested in the President by certain clauses in the Constitution and wanted him to sign it.
The President has mentioned that he had sent a reply to the UNP that even though Mr. Wickremesinghe would be made the Prime Minister, the powers vested in the President could not be transferred to him.
He said that was how Mr. Wickremesinghe had acted throughout and that he had endured the last three and half years with great difficulty.
The President said he decided to form a new government after appointing Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister as he could not bear it any longer. In addition to this he said a plot to assassinate him had also come to light.
President Sirisena said that he and Premier Rajapaksa were now taking decisions together and have a clear idea about how to take the country forward in the future and asked the organisers not to worry about such matters but carry out their respective tasks successfully.
The President has said the new government could proceed after rectifying the shortcomings that existed earlier and appealed for everyone?s support for that to be achieved.
He has said the collapse of the previous government began with the Central Bank bond scam.
President Sirisena has said that the people had made their views on this known very clearly when the results of the last Local Government election took place but the UNP and its leader were unable to understand the message that was sent.
He has said the UNP had been unable to get rid of policies of privatization and selling state property and assets to foreigners and maintained that he had opposed such moves from the very beginning. (Ajantha Kumara Agalakada)

Japanese Assistance: A pillar of strength  to SL?s economy
	
?
Foreign assistance has been a hot topic in Sri Lanka lately. Earlier Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe talked of loans taken by the previous regime to the tune of US$ 4 billion the other day and said this too had contributed to the country?s present economic crisis. However foreign assistance varies and is unique some times. Assistance given by Japan to Sri Lanka especially through Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) is such a scheme of assistance. These do not involve commercial loans but only does Sri Lanka?s economy good.? ?
?
?
Warakapola Hospital was granted a loan worth 3,935 million Yen to develop the new ultra modern building
	JICA provided 5,151 million Yen for Greater Kandy?Water Supply Project
	Japan has also pledged assistance to the new parallel Kelani Bridge which is under construction
?
According to officials of the Japanese Embassy in Sri Lanka it is multifaceted. Therefore assistance comes through Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATYREPS), private public partnerships and volunteer programmes which are examples of assistance offered by Japan.?
SATYREPS is designed to promote joint research in which both Japanese research institutions and those of developing countries work together in such countries under the JICA framework technical cooperation projects based on social needs. It aims to acquire new knowledge and utilize research outcomes to the benefit of the society with a view to resolving global issues such as environment, energy conservation and disaster prevention.? ?

?
Volunteer programs support activities by citizens who wish to cooperate in the economic and social development as well as reconstruction of developing countries. The first volunteer was dispatched to Sri Lanka from Japan in 1981 and there are 70 volunteers in the country currently.? ?
When it comes to private public partnerships it involves collaboration with the private sector.? ?
The assistance programs include the Warakapola hospital project where JICA developed medical facilities at Warakapola Hospital where a loan worth Yen 3,935 million is given to develop a new ultra modern building. This new building which was opened in February this year comprises modern equipment to deal with non communicable diseases such as cardio-vascular disease. As one of the fastest growing countries in the world, non communicable diseases has overtaken communicable diseases in terms of mortality and had become a major health concern in the country. Therefore the medical facilities in the new building cater to this need. District Health Director Kegalle Dr. Vijith Gunasekera said the number of beds in the hospital has been increased to 500 from 150 with the Japanese assistance. ? We now have several new facilities in the hospital including a paediatric unit, radiology unit and consultancy services? Dr. Gunasekera said.? ?
One of the two key initiatives implemented under the Japanese Volunteer programme is the training of baseball player undertaken by Kazuya Yagi who had developed a baseball team in S. W. R. D Bandaranaike MV in Kundasale. Yagi?s efforts have yielded results as one child from the school had been chosen for Sri Lanka?s junior team. Mr. Yagi said he hopes to create a women?s baseball team as well. Mr. Yagi speaks fluent Sinhalese. Satomi Wada who is conversant in Tamil provides training on environment protection in Vincent Girl?s High School Batticola. She demonstrated how to make compost to the children speaking in fluent Tamil.? ?

Greater Kandy Water Supply Project is a Japanese funded symbolic project including construction of Katugastota Water Treatment Plant. The project has completely changed the landscape of waterw? supply situation in the big urban city of Kandy. JICA supported the realization of the Project through its concessionary loan scheme up to Yen 5,151 million. The Project provides safe pipe born water supply to the population of around 400,000 in Kandy City and Suburb areas covering Gagavata Korale PS Division, Harispattuwa DS Division, Akurana DS Division, Part of Pathadumbhra DS Division, and Part of Poojapitiya DS Division.
The Project constructed fully-fledged water supply scheme facilities including water intake structure, water treatment plant, and water pumping stations with storage reservoirs, water towers, water transmission, water pipe mains and water distribution pipe lines for taking water to peoples door step. According to chief engineer of the project Sarath Gamini the water services of the pumping station in Kundasale is not confined to water supply alone but is also involved in testing quality of water meters as well. He said the supply of water is increased though the project. Japan which had provided funds to the tune of Yen 5,151 million for this project.? ?
Another significant project funded by Japan is the Kundasale compost plant. This is a unique project according to environment officer Pradeshiya Sabha Kundalse Lalith K. Ratnayake as it is a joint effort of two local bodies namely Kundasale Pradeshiya Sabha and Pahatha Dumbara Pradeshiya Sabha. ?Compost is made out of biodegradable garbage collected by both local bodies,? Mr. Ratnayake said. This project had proven to be a profitable one as the average monthly profit is said to be 250,000.??

According to head of National Building Research Organization the school was caught in a landslide in 2011. A sum of Rs 8 million has been spent for the project. The project was carried out by KOIWA KANAAMI, Ltd and its partner NITTOKU Construction Ltd under the Japan International Cooperation Agency(JICA)?s assistance NBRO.?
Japan has extended its support to the transport sector as well and a perfect example of this is the funding of Manmunai Bridge for which it had provided Yen 1,206 million. Japan has also pledged assistance to the new parallel Kelani Bridge, which is under construction

Parliament would reconvene on November 16 as per the Gazette issued by President Maithripala Sirisena and not on Monday, November 5, UPFA MP Susil Premajayantha said today.
Earlier yesterday, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa said President Sirisena would likely to reconvene Parliament on November 5 instead of November 16.
However, addressing a news briefing at the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Office, MP Premajayantha said at least three working days were required to reconvene Parliament once it was prorogued.

No trains on Northern line from Monday: Railway TUs
	
Railway trade unions today said that the train services on the northern railway line would be disrupted from this Sunday night if the Police failed to arrest those who were involved with Pothuhera blockade incident last evening, within 48 hrs.
Speaking to the media Railway Trade Union Alliance (RTUA) Co-Convener Lal Ariyaratne said the trade unions including Sri Lanka Railway Station Masters' Union, Ceylon Railway Guards Union, Railway Engine Drivers Union and Train Controllers' Union would support the trade union action.
The Trade Unions had informed the matter to the Railways? General Manager and he had assured legal action against the individuals who were involved in incident within 24-hours.
?We will start our strike after another 24 hours,? he said.
The trade union alliance vowed trade union action if the authorities failed to take legal action over the suspects.
Mr Ariyaratne said that all train services on the northern railway line beyond Polgahawela, including the office and the night mail trains, would be suspended as a result of scheduled trade union action.
He requested the Police to investigate the matter based on the video footages taken by the Police officers during the incident.
He also added that during the trade union action the security of the employees and the railway properties should be protected by the law enforcement authorities and in case of any damage to the properties or employees? lives it would lead into an islandwide trade union action.

Selective tear-shedding  in seasons of demagoguery
	
Disclaimer 1: Over the past three months I?ve written a series of articles under the title ?Notes for a Manifesto? seeking to inform those who are currently developing or intend to develop ?plans for the country/people? with elections in mind. In addition to an introductory note, eleven areas were covered: a) the state, b) justice, law and order, c) the executive, d) religion, e) education, f) reconciliation, g) environment, h) national security, i) sports, j) foreign policy, and k) health. Note that these were not written in terms of priority. The twelfth and final piece was to cover gender and sexuality. That will have to wait for obvious reasons.? ?
Disclaimer 2: Regardless of its constitutionality or otherwise (which we shall come to presently), what took place on October 26, 2018 was an affront to the fundamental tenets of democracy. It smacks of political machinations which, although orchestrated in the name of the people (as is common) is about securing and protecting political futures of individuals.? ?
On October 30, people gathered in Colombo to protest what they believed was a travesty of justice and a subversion of democracy. A common poster which resonated with many status updates in social media had it that it was not out of love for Ranil but a love for democracy, justice, constitutionality and such.? ?
I am sure that among those holding the This-Is-Not-About-Love-For-Ranil placards were some who have consistently championed such causes. That such people had to rub shoulders with people who couldn?t care less about such things and indeed have subverted them is, all things considered, forgivable.? ?
Was it really about such things, though? The party supporters, who probably made the majority of the crowd, certainly haven?t shown much concern over the years. Not just them of course. The rights-community (read, ?pro-UNP NGO Community?), certain sections of the ?international community? and political commentators who would have us believe that they are above party politics. We?ll get to them too.? ?
First, the constitutionality issue. Kusal Perera has laid it out best, I believe, in a recent blogpost titled ?Two constitutional coups applauded by two different social segments?:? ?
It is now known that in 2015 January, PM Jayaratne was coerced and manipulated to provide a back dated resignation letter to fit in with Clause 46(2)(a) of the Constitution, while this time, President Sirisena removes PM Wickremesinghe with a single sentence using the same Clause 42(4) that has to be read along with Clause 46(2)(a) to have Constitutional meaning proper. It wasn?t done that way then in 2015 January and it wasn?t done now.?
And in both occasions, it remains a ?Constitutional coup? in changing political power without the consent of the people and by using the Constitution the wrong way that violates the ?sovereignty of the people?. In these ?Constitutional Coups? it is always pre decided to get back to the Constitution thereafter with a majority negotiated and manipulated in parliament to be in line with Clause 42(4). In 2015 January, this blatant violation of the Constitution was applauded and accepted by the Colombo ?civil society? leaders while the Sinhala Buddhist majority was left numb and helpless. Now in 2018 October, the lower layers of the Sinhala Buddhist society light crackers and eat ?kiribath? while the Colombo ?civil society? leaders remain dismayed and helpless. In both instances, the ?sovereignty of the people? wasn?t even thought of as non negotiable.
There is yet a political factor that makes October 2018 different to that of 2015 January. In January 2015 the Constitutional Coup was played out with the euphoria in Colombo over ousting President Rajapaksa, whose rule was painted black in a single stroke. That violation of the Constitution was applauded and accepted by the urban middle-class as a step towards furthering ?democracy?. In October 2018, the Constitutional Coup is still in play endorsed by the Sinhala Buddhist majority and with the Colombo middle class, though frustrated and betrayed by this ?Unity? government, still prefer the Wickremesinghe government to any led by Rajapaksa. Unfortunately for the UNP this urban middle class remains passive and would not intervene as a political force to save the UNP government.
So, when people say ?there?s chaos in Colombo? and issue ominous notes about ?constitutional crisis? one must wonder, ?where were these people all this time?? It?s not just about the coup-moment, though.? ?
Where were the majority of self-righteous objectors when Jayaratne was sacked? Where were they when the entire circus over the removal, replacement, resignation and replacement again of three Chief Justices took place? Where were they when the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe combine dissolved Parliament to prevent the COPE Report on the Central Bank Bond Issue scam from being made public?? ?
When Sirisena gave nomination to Mahinda Rajapaksa and immediately thereafter stood with Wickremesinghe, did they whimper about ?the spirit of democracy?? When he sacked and replaced the General Secretaries of the SLFP and UPFA, going as far as obtaining an interim court order so that the Central Committees of these political entities could not function, did they protest? Have they ever raised questions about the constitutional tinkering of the UNP leader within the party to secure and protect dictatorial power? Did they recall political histories of individuals and parties (as they do regarding Rajapaksa) when talking ofSirisena, Wickremesinghe and the UNP(and of course Chandrika Kumaratunga)? Kusal Perera has been consistent. Few others have.? ?
The democratic claims of the UNP and Wickremesinghe are as thin as those of Sirisena, Rajapaksa, Kumaratunga and the SLFP. The loyalists of these non-UNP worthies uttered not a word when they thumbed their noses at such things. Kumaratunga also prorogued Parliament. She subverted the Wickremesinghe-led Government in December 2003. Rajapaksa loyalists did not object to the 18th Amendment and Sirisena?s fans have been quiet about his political jugglery. Friend now, foe later and still later friend ? that?s the story of these individuals and parties. That makes most of the noise on the subject pretty hollow.? ?
And yet, when Asanga Welikala wrote and Groundviews published a rant hours after this coup, I was willing to cut him some slack purely due to the title, ?Paradise Lost? Preliminary Notes on a Constitutional Coup.? It?s the word ?preliminary? that persuaded me, even though his obviously paradisiacal delusions about what he believes was ?lost? (obviously a UNP/Ranil-led Government).? ?
Then I checked on what he has had to say about the term ?National Government?. I was shocked. The man actually edited a book titled ?The Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution: Content and Context?. The contributors have talked about various aspects but obviously the Editor has not thought fit to ask anyone to dwell on the lack of clarity in the term. Worse, he shows unforgivable sloth in his own introductory comment where he erroneously states that ?National Government [is] defined as where the first and second largest parties come together to form a government.?? ?
Jayampathy Wickramaratne, in his Ranil/UNP-defense, has offered a more sophisticated argument than Welikala?s, but he hinges it on a convenient and ridiculous interpretation of ?National Government? [Note: ?National Government? is key here because definitional-vagueness is what has allowed the defenders of this coup to argue that Wickremesinghe?s cabinet (exceeding the constitutionally sanctioned limit) loses standing the moment the ?National Government? ceases to exist]. Wickramaratne words his hilarity thus: ?i n any case, the National Government continues as the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress continues to be in it.? That?s a slap on Welikala.? ?
All these defenses, claims and expressions of horror have been echoed by the United States of America, the United Kingdom and the European Union in various statements, nauseatingly so because the tone and content are those of Viceroys and not ?friendly nations?. Sure, some of them acknowledge spending millions of dollars to defeat the Rajapaksas and say it was ?for good governance? but their silence when the yahapalana project went sour tells us that it was basically the funding of a political group that would serve their (the particular nation?s) interests (just like MPs are being bribed to stay or crossover these days, as they have been in years gone by). That?s money badly spent for it seems that the people are not buying the yahapalana lie any more.? ?
What needs to be understood is that unsavory as all these political parties and politicians are, they have on occasion obtained legitimacy in the form of people?s support. While legality does play in legitimacy, right now the legality is at best unclear where as Wickremesinghe and Sirisena had lost it. That?s with the Rajapaksa?s and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna. Sirisena, in declined political circumstances is clinging to that ?popular legitimacy? (as opposed to ?constitutional legitimacy?) perhaps thinking of his political future. Wickremesinghe does not hold any aces here. That?s the reality.? ?
The only way legitimacy can be determined clearly is an election. The yahapalanists balked at going before the people. Local Government Elections were delayed and Provincial Council Elections keep getting postponed. Given the constitutional bind on elections, there are no other ?litmus tests? on ?popular legitimacy?. Most of the ardent voices uttering dire statements about the threat to democracy have been silent on the blatant anti-democratic move by the yahapalana government regarding elections.? ?
We do not know how it will play out. The chances are that once the new dispensation, with or without legality, take control of the state apparatus, Wickremesinghe and the UNP will lose out. Politicians looking to futures will cross. Provincial Council elections will see the UNP being routed. The better way would have been elections and that?s a complaint one can level against the UNP as well. Had they allowed the people to speak, then this would not have happened. They made holes for themselves and others crept through them.? ?
Is there chaos in Colombo, then? Colombo 7, metaphorically speaking, seems to be upset. Upset too, are those who object to every single undemocratic move regardless of who is doing the moving. Sadly, that?s a minority and very few of the vocal objectors to what happened on October 26, 2018, do not belong to it. It is best not to be moved by tears shed selectively and we?ve seen buckets of such selective-tears over the past few days, just as we saw then immediately after Sirisena became President.? ?
