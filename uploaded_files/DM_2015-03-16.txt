Calls for international war crimes probe 'insulting': CBK
	
	Sri Lanka is united against an international investigation into alleged war crimes during its 26-year-long civil war, according to its former president, Chandrika Kumaratunga.
	Kumaratunga, who served as president of Sri Lanka from 1994-2005, said that both the Sri Lankan people and its politicians found the calls for a UN-led international investigation "insulting" by implying that the country could not carry out its own.
	Speaking to IBTimes UK on at the International Conference on Education in Dubai, she said that while Sri Lanka would ask the UN to provide technical support, the probe would be a domestic one.
	"The whole country doesn't want (an international inquiry) because it is the feeling that it is insulting to the government that we cannot carry out our own investigation in a transparent manner," she said.
	Sri Lanka's president, Maithripala Sirisena, has said the country would launch a domestic enquiry into crimes committed during the war with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), but ruled out the investigation being carried out by an international body.
	The calls for a UN-led probe intensified in March 2014, when mass graves were uncovered in the Tamil north of the country and the UN Human Rights Council began a report into whether the army had carried out widespread abuses against civilians.
	It was announced in February that the report was being shelved for another six months, and is now due in September.
	The UN estimates that up to 100,000 people died during the conflict, which ended in 2009.
	Filmmaker Callum Macrae recently released No Fire Zone: a documentary in Sinhala  one of Sri Lanka's official languages  which accuses the Sri Lankan government of targeting civilians.
	Macrae, who directed the film, said last week that a domestic inquiry would not be credible.
	"How does he [Sirisena] expect witnesses and survivors of these awful crimes to come forward and testify at a domestic investigation set up by someone who has effectively said in advance that he 'doesn't believe' the events they will describe How can such a process be described as 'impartial'" Macrae said in a press release.
	The BBC reported that when President Sirisena was asked about the documentary, he said that he "doesn't believe" the allegations, but Kumaratunga said that the president had been "misunderstood", and that if the filmmakers had evidence then it should be passed on to the investigators.
	
	"If it is presented as evidence then he will see it," she said.
	Kumaratunga and her family have been major figures in Sri Lankan politics for almost a century.
	Her father, Solomon Bandaranaike, was prime minister until his assassination in 1959, her brother was speaker of the Sri Lankan government and her husband, Vijaya  a popular politician and film star  who was shot dead in 1988.
	Kumaratunga was elected president in 1994. Five years later, during her re-election campaign, she was blinded in her right eye after an assassination attempt by the LTTE. She stood down as president in 2005.

Video: Cabinet approved our proposals: JHU
	
The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) today said that the Cabinet had approved the JHU proposed reforms on pruning powers of the Executive as it had opposed to the Prime Ministers proposal, which it said was detrimental to the stability of the country.
JHU General Secretary and Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said according to the Prime Ministers proposal, though the President continues to be the Head of the State, he should consult the Prime Minister, who would be the head of the government on controlling the Executive.
We rejected these proposals because it would make an impact on the stability of the country. Therefore, we suggested that the President should continue to be the Head of the State, the Government, Executive and Armed forces.
However, a number of powers of the post will be curtailed to create equilibrium among the Executive, Legislature and the Judiciary, he said. (By Lahiru Pothmulla)

Defence HQ constructions halted
	
	Construction work on the Defence Headquarters Complex in Battaramulla has come to a halt due to non-availability of funds, and Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake saying funds will not be released until the exact cost estimation of the project is clarified.
Minister Karunanayake told the Daily Mirror that the necessary funds were available but it would not be released until a conclusion was reached on the amount of finances the project would involve.
What exactly is the cost of the entire project Where is the cabinet approval for the costing The exact costing of the project is not mentioned in any of the documents available on the project. In one document it states a portion of 2.5% off the total cost which is Rs. 50 billion is commissioned to the architectural firm involved with it. These figures need probing - these are questions that need to be answered before the funds are released, he said.
The funds contained in the irregular Defence Ministry account finances collected through CATIC and Shangri-La deals  that was highlighted by Minister Karunanayake himself, were reserved for the construction expenses of the Defence Headquarters.
As a responsible government we cannot simply release tax payers money unless its certain that they are put to good use. Presently, this project seems like a bottomless pit and we need to know the depth of what we are getting into. From the current state of finances allocated for this project it seems as if they are building a complex thats even bigger than the Pentagon! the Minister remarked.
Speaking further he said the finance would be released as soon as the cost details are determined. It is not a case of not being equipped with the finances  its just a case of removing the corruption element from the previous contract, he added.
In 2011, the government sought approval for a Rs. 20 billion allocation for parliamentary approval for the constructions of the Defence headquarters in Akuregoda, Battaramulla. Then the government announced its constructions are expected to conclude by 2013.(Lakna Paranamanna)

No poll before electoral reforms-Nimal
	
	The main opposition UPFA today reiterated that there would be no Parliamentary Elections before introducing Constitutional and Electoral reforms and it would not let Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to force President Maithripala Sirisenas hand to dissolve Parliament soon after April 23 as he had already announced.
Leader of the Opposition, Nimal Sirisipala De Silva told a hastily called press conference at his office that the constituent partners of the UPFA took the decision to introduce Constitutional and Electoral reforms in one go and not to go for an election after a lengthy discussion with President Sirisena last morning.
Asked whether President Sirisena was agreeable to their stance, he said We are confident that he would agree as those arrangements are included in his 100-day programme. What we want is these two legislative arrangements to be passed in Parliament in one go and not piecemeal.
The demands to abolish the executive Presidency or at-least to prune its draconian powers and also to introduce a mixed electoral system have been floating among politicians, political parties, professionals, media and among the public for several decades but no government was able to go ahead with this vital reforms.
Therefore, this is the last opportunity to do this as all political parties in Parliament, including the UNP, are in agreement to do this as early as possible.
This exercise will not be difficult as the UPFA with 139 members in Parliament are fully supportive for the reforms, Mr. De Silva stressed. (Sandun A Jayasekera)Pix by Kushan Pathiraja

	The girl had come willingly because of some of the issues with her parents. He didnt take her forcibly. She had also given a statement to the National Child Protection Authority that she had come willingly because of the issues at home, Minister Senaratne said.

Ranil reiterates SLs right to protect its territorial waters
	
	Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe has reiterated Sri Lankas right to shoot Indian fishermen who violate the maritime border and poach in Lankan waters. In an interview with the NDTV, the PM had said that even though Sri Lanka and India are working to resolve the fishermen's issue, the country's navy has the right to shoot anyone who intrudes into SLs territorial waters.
	The reiteration of the controversial comment comes on the heels of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's trip to the island nation which he said was a "successful visit".
	Speaking to NDTV, Mr Wickremasinghe said, "The Lankan navy has the right to shoot in any part of the country if anyone enters territorial waters, this is nothing new".
	The main issue, he said, was bottom trawling by fishing boats and it has to stop. "That has been acknowledged by all sides."
	Earlier this month, ahead of PM Modi's visit, Mr Wickremasinghe told a Tamil news channel, "If someone tries to break into my house, I can shoot. If he gets killed... Law allows me to do that... Why are you coming into our waters Stay on the Indian side."
	The comment had caused huge controversy and days later, on March 12, the Lankan Navy had allegedly hurled petrol bombs at Indian fishing boats. No one had been injured. In February, 86 Indian fishermen were arrested and 10 fishing boats were seized by the Lankan Navy.
	Mr Wickremasinghe said the two countries were working on a solution to the issue. "The foreign minister (Sushma Swaraj) when she was here, told me that they are trying to get them (the fishermen) moved out," he said. Ms Swaraj had visited Lanka ahead of PM Modi's visit.
	PM Modi, Mr Wickremasinghe said, had "reached out" to Sri Lanka and the Lankans had responded.
	"It makes a case that there should be regular visits by Indian PM to Lanka, but he covered every part and showed that India stood for all Sri Lankans. While we have to settle the outstanding problems in the North, India was not thinking only of the north but all Sri Lanka," he added.
