Accountability issues: Govt. to set up judicial mechanism
	
In the wake of the Office of Missing Persons Bill being passed in Parliament, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera said the Government would go ahead with the setting up of a judicial mechanism to hear accountability issues.
He said the new legislation would provide for the setting up of a Truth Commission next month to ascertain the circumstances under which people went missing.
Addressing a hurriedly summoned news conference, the minister said the new legislation fulfilled the commitment made to the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) and was in line with the mandate received by President Maithripala Sirisena.
He said there were conflicting figures with regard to the number of people gone missing under various circumstances and that it was important to confirm the actual number. The minister said the ICRC, in its latest report, had placed the number at 16,008, the UN Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances at 12,000 and the Paranagama Commission at 24,000.
Of the number mentioned by the UN Working Group, he said 5,100 were from the security forces.
"This is not a judicial mechanism. It is a truth seeking mechanism. It will trace the fate of those who went missing and the circumstances in which it happened," the minister said adding that the Office of Missing Persons would recommend measures to avoid disappearances in the future.
He said funds would be raised from internal and external sources and the latter would be channeled through the External Resources Department of the Central Bank. He said foreign experts might be consulted by the OMP when carrying out its duties and pointed out that it would have accesses to any of the detention centres without prior notice.
The minister said an amendment by the JVP to notify the police within 48 hours after such a visit was incorporated in the Bill and added that one of the clauses provided for the protection of confidentiality of those giving information. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)

Fighter jets are necessary: Amunugama
	
Special Assignment Minister Sarath Amunugama today justified the governments decisions to purchase eight multirole fighter jets to upgrade the Sri Lanka Air Force fleet.
While addressing a media briefing at the SLFP headquarters, the Minister said the minimum number of eight fighter jets was a request made by the Air Force.
Some may say there is no requirement to purchase fighter jets at the moment. But I disagree. As one of three forces, Air Force must be combat ready and it is required to update the fleet to maintain the oceanic security and to face any unexpected threat. They have to do their rehearsals to keep them up to date with their tactics.
For that, we should make a suitable environment for the pilots, he said responding to a journalist.
Most of the fighter jets that we have had been used during the war and therefore, the air force had requested eight fighter jets, the Minister said.

The issues we have due to obtaining loans will not be solved only because new jets were added to the fleet. The loan amount we have to pay is increasing. We cannot continue to toy with the previous governments loans. We will be paying the loans at some point, he said.
The proposal to purchase multirole fighter jets and associated weapons, made by President Maithripala Sirisena in his capacity as the Minister of Defence, was approved by the Cabinet on Tuesday. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Janashakthi 2Q soars as general insurance biz expands after AIA deal
	
Sri Lankas third largest general insurer by gross written premiums (GWPs), Janashakthi Insurance PLC (Janashakthi) group, increased its June quarter (2Q16) net profit to Rs. 272.5 million or 50 cents a share from Rs.105.2 million recorded a year earlier, supported by strong growth in general insurance business.
This translates in to a 159 percent growth over the corresponding period last year.
This was despite the higher benefits and claims paid during the period. The company expects at least Rs.4.6 billion of claims from the recent floods which wreaked havoc in some parts of the country bringing some commercial activities to a temporary halt.
The group paid Rs.1.68 billion in benefits and claims during the quarter, increasing from Rs.1.22 billion a year ago.  
Since the acquisition of AIA General Insurance Lanka Limited in a deal worth Rs.3.2 billion in October 2015, Janashakthi has now become the third largest general insurer with market share of 17.5 percent based on GWP.
The non-life GWPs of the combined entity during the 2Q16 grew by 39 percent year-on-year (yoy) to Rs.2.43 billion while the motor insurance accounted for Rs.1.76 billion in the portfolio, which grew by a similar percentage.
The life insurance GWPs grew by 21.5 percent yoy to Rs. 757.1 million. The total GWPs of the group for the quarter was up 34.5 percent yoy to Rs.3.19 billion.
Despite the October acquisition, AIA was financially consolidated from January 29, 2016 hence this was the first full quarter of the Janashakthi group since the landmark acquisition, which resulted in goodwill of Rs.1.4 billion.
Sri Lankas insurance industry is now in a consolidation mode as players are seen shedding their less profitable and highly competitive general insurance businesses to focus on life business.
In 2015 Union Assurance PLC divested 78 percent stake in its general business unit, Union Assurance General Limited to Fairfax Asia Limited for a total consideration of Rs.3.66 billion.
Thereafter in June 2016 Softlogic Holdings general insurance unit, Asian Alliance General Limited was sold to Fairfax Asia for Rs.1.27 billion.
Sri Lankas non-life insurance market is dominated by motor insurance, which accounted for as much as 65 percent of gross written premiums in 2015. 
Fitch Ratings in a recent sector update said the higher flood claims could affect some of the lower capitalized insurers and the situation could be further threatened by weaker profitability driven by intense competition in the non-life business, especially in motor insurance.
The state-owned re-insurer, National Insurance Trust Fund (NITF) estimated the total claims from the disaster to be around Rs.15.5 billion or US $ 107 million.
Janashakthi group for the six months ended in June 30, 2016 (1H16) recorded a net profit of Rs.630.1 million or Rs.1.60 a share recording an increase of close to 200 percent yoy.
The total GWPs for the 1H16 rose by 33.5 percent yoy to Rs. 6.5 billion.
Janashakthi meanwhile has entered into an agreement with Sanken Construction (Private) Limited to assign the leasehold rights of the property at No. 24, Staples Street, Colombo 02 for a consideration of Rs. 1.93 billion for which purpose the latter had already paid 50 percent advance.
This transaction was to be concluded by March 25, 2016 subject to obtaining the approvals of the Urban Development Authority and cabinet of ministers. Janashakthi and Sanken Construction (Private) Limited have mutually agreed to extend the period up to September 25, 2016 and have entered into a Supplementary Agreement on March25 , 2016, pending approval of the cabinet of ministers, the company said in a note to the financial statements.
As of June 30, 2016, the holding company, Janashakthi PLC held 75.92 percent stake in the company while Dunamis Capital PLC held 3.17 percent stake being the second largest shareholders.
Bank of Ceylon held 2.03 percent stake being the third largest shareholder.

The Magistrate further remanded the suspect till August 25 and ordered the Prison Superintendent to produce the suspect in the Gampaha Magistrates Court for an identification parade in connection with the assault on journalist Upali Tennakoon. (Indika Manoj Cooray and Dayaratne Pathirana)

Office of Missing Persons Bill: Vote to be taken tomorrow
	
The government, yesterday, decided to advance the date of enactment of the Office of Missing Persons Bill in Parliament to Friday, it is learnt.
Earlier it had been scheduled for debate during the third week of August. However, the government decided to have the debate today and vote tomorrow on its enactment.

Meanwhile, the Sectoral Oversight Committee on the subject has proposed two amendments to the bill.

Pan Asia Bank to make your condominium dream a reality
	
Post-war Sri Lanka has seen a phenomenal increase in demand for medium to high-end condominium properties.
In order to cater to this increasing demand, a large number of luxury and semi luxury condominium projects have been coming up to the real estate market, creating unparallel investment opportunities for individuals who dream of owning such a property.
This demand is being propelled by the desire of individuals who seek to either to use them as a luxurious residence in a convenient location or simply as an investment which could be sold in the future realizing a high capital gain.
However in the current context there are many interested potential buyers who are unable to realize their condominium dream due to non availability of a suitable financial solution. Understanding this vacuum in the market Pan Asia Bank has come with a range of innovative financial solutions to enable customers to realize their condominium dream regardless of their purchasing intention.

An investment
Pan Asia Bank Condominium Investment loan is the ideal solution for customers who are looking to invest in and benefit from the rapidly appreciating condominium market. It is a term loan that can be obtained to purchase a property during its development stage or a completed condominium apartment from a list of well established property developers acceptable to the Bank.
Under this scheme an investor can borrow up to 75 percent of the purchase price stated in the sales agreement for under construction condominium apartments and 75 percent of the actual purchase price or 75 percent of the Forced Sale Value (FSV) of the property with a maximum loan value as high as Rs.50 million. The Bank will provide 5 years of grace period to repay the capital enabling customers to service only the monthly interest. Customers can repay the capital as a bullet payment within 5 years at by selling the condominium. The bank also allows customers to make capital payments during the period without making any additional fee to reduce the loan quantum.

For residential purposes
Pan Asia Banks flagship housing loan scheme, Nivasa has been further enhanced to cater to the increasing demand for condominium apartments for residential purposes.
Accordingly Nivasa housing loan customers can obtain loan facilities with a repayment period of up to 25 years and up to 75 percent of the actual purchase price with a maximum loan value of Rs25mn. The upper limit applicable to the loan quantum may be waived in instances where the customer possesses additional repayment capacity. 
In order make the experience of purchasing a condominium for further rewarding for customers, the bank has tied up with a list of well reputed property developers offering speedy service for their customers.

Income limitations
In order to enable customers who are constrained by their current income limitations which prevent them from going for the property of their dream Pan Asia Banks newly introduced Nivasa-Step Up housing loan scheme provides the ideal solution.
This unique loan scheme is offered with a flexible repayment option enabling professionals and permanent employed customers to repay the loan with lower installments initially and increase the installments gradually as their income increases. Since the installments are comparatively low during the initial stages it enhances a customers ability to go for a higher loan quantum making their property dream a reality. This option can even be used as a second housing loan for investment purpose. 
Under this scheme, loans can be obtained up to Rs 15 million with a repayment period of 20 years with the option of customer paying lower installments initially. It also allows customers to choose the percentage increase in installment gradually as their income increases. The upper limit applicable to the loan quantum may be waived in instances where the customer possesses additional repayment capacity.
The Bank has tied-up with following property developers for condominium loans; Havelock City Apartments by Overseas Reality (Ceylon) PLC, Fairway Holdings (Pvt) Ltd, Prime Lands (Pvt) Ltd/Prime Residencies, Blue Mountain Properties ( Private ) Limited, Home Lands Skyline (Private) Limited, Platinum 1  by The Kingsbury , Colombo, Trillium Property Management & Services (Pvt) Ltd, Expo Property Developers, Mulberry Residence by Steradian Capital Investments (Pvt) Ltd, Suncity Property Developers, Blue Ocean group of companies, Millennium Housing Developers PLC and ALTAIR by Indocean Developers (Pvt) Ltd.

Rupee edges up on dollar sales by exporters, foreigners
	
REUTERS: The Sri Lankan rupee ended slightly higher yesterday as dollar sales by exporters and foreign investors surpassed purchases by state-run banks, dealers said.
The spot rupee ended at 145.58/62 per dollar, compared with Tuesdays close of 145.60/65.
The spot rupee is usually managed by the Central Bank, and market participants use the forward market levels for guidance on the currency.
There was exporter (dollar) selling by local banks and a foreign bank, probably for foreign investors to buy government securities, a currency dealer said, asking not to be named.
But the two state banks dollar buying prevented the rupee from appreciating.
Since a US $ 1.5 billion inflow from a dual-tenure sovereign bond issue, the Central Bank has largely not intervened in the currency market to defend the rupee. The Central Bank officials were not available for comment.
One-week rupee forwards ended at 145.75/80 per dollar, compared with Tuesdays close of 145.80/90.
Foreign investors net bought Rs.63.7 billion worth of government securities from April 29 through August 3, Central Bank data showed.
The Central Bank on July 28 raised its main interest rates by 50 basis points each in a surprise move aimed at curbing stubbornly high credit growth that is adding to concerns about inflationary pressures. The rupee gained last week as foreign investors sold dollars to buy local shares, expecting better profits from corporates on hopes that a recent rate increase by the countrys Central Bank would help improve the island nations macro-economic outlook.
