Yet another reshuffle!
	
?
According to a story that has come down the grapevine quite recently, yet another reshuffle of the big pack is around the corner.
?
Those due to be moved around this time round are mostly the Green ones in the pack and they include one or two grey-haired ones who have failed to prove their mettle. Kala Madam who recently drew much fire for making a statement considered politically blasphemous is also slated to be moved out and a suitable replacement is being looked for, they say.
Meanwhile, a rumour afloat says that a purohita who appointed family members to high office and another one handling a religious affair are to get the walking papers.?
By the way, of the 23 Diyawanna ones who have so far taken refuge in the Compassionate One, 22 have already got some high office or other and the odd man out, a prodigal son back home now is likely to get some good place in the coming reshuffle, they say.

Chinese tout menace goes rampant in several areas
	
Authorised tour guides in Sigiriya expressed concern about constant clashes between them and the Chinese touts, and they requested the government to save the Sri Lankan tour guides from touts. They pointed out that they obtained the tour guide licence from the Minister of Tourism after a formal training under the ministry and the Central Provincial Council.
They said a member of the Sigiriya Tour Guide Association Hashan Dilruk(28) was injured in a clash between the Sri Lankan Tour Guides and a group of Chinese touts and admitted to hospital.
?An organised group of Chinese on tourist VISA enter the area under the Central Cultural Fund by paying Rs.50/- and function as tour guides, much to the anxiety of the authorized tour guides. We are facing a serious threat from these individuals. Most of them are workers in projects undertaken by Chinese construction companies. One of our members has been assaulted by a Chinese who claimed that he has been functioning as a guide for more than two years. This has been going on unchecked in other areas as well, but the ministry has not yet taken any steps against this illegal act,? Dilruk said.
Meanwhile, Project Manager of the Central Cultural Fund Anura Nishantha said he would take immediate steps to check the tour guide identity cards and to prevent the ongoing irregularity, and said the police would investigate the alleged assault on a Sri Lanka tour guide.

Concerns over move to Reinstate Controversial CMC Commissioner
	
According to Anura, the CMC had obtained Army vehicles to bulldoze the dump on?the instructions?of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa
	?
	Questions?are asked as?to why the CMC extended the contract period to hire garbage collection vehicles
	?
	The then Commissioner in his reply had noted that he had informed the President and Prime Minister of the necessity to use Rydall-OE
	?
	According?to Dr. Kariyawasam, before using such an enzyme or a chemical, the Municipal Council has a responsibility to get its efficacy tested in a laboratory
	?
	According?to? CMC?Payment Branch a proposal to supply the odor eliminator had been received by?the former Commissioner
?
The attempt to bring the former Colombo Municipal Commissioner back to office by a group of UNP Municipal Councilors has raised eyebrows in?the council.
?
Former Colombo Municipal Commissioner V.K.A. Anura was removed from office early this year on the recommendation of the Presidential Commission. This was after the commission probed into the collapse of the Meetotamulla garbage dump and found that he had failed to take necessary action to prevent the catastrophe, which occurred on April 14, 2017.?
President Maithripala Sirisena appointed a one member Presidential Commission headed by retired Justice of the Court of Appeal Dr. Chandradasa Nanayakkara on April 26, 2017 and the report related to the probe was released on October 26, 2017.
The report reveals how the former Municipal Commissioner failed to take necessary action to avert the garbage dump collapse despite he being informed by the officials on the looming threat well in advance.
It had also come to light how the chemical that had been sprayed on the Meetotamulla dump to eliminate its odor, a few days before the tragedy occurred, is alleged to have caused the collapse killing nearly 30 people. The former Commissioner is also accused of paying enormous amounts of money to garbage carriers while huge amounts of money comparing to his predecessor?s time, had been paid to a private company to flatten the dump without calling for quotations.
?Considering the amount of money that had been spent to flatten the garbage dump, it is questionable as to how it collapsed. Had the dump been flattened regularly, and considering the payments made by the CMC to the contractor, how could the garbage heap rise up to 150 feet high? Why didn?t the CMC lay soil in between the garbage layers to tighten the heap together to avoid a downfall?? CMC member Shamila Gonawala queried.? ??
According to the revelations, despite the looming risk that was brought to the notice of the Municipal Commissioner by the Divisional Secretary Kolonnawa on April 7, 2018- which was one week before the tragedy stuck- Commissioner V.K.V. Anura had ignored the recommendations. He had also failed to take prompt action to avert the calamity. Had the Commissioner taken necessary action the municipal councilors are of the view that the tragedy could have been avoided along with the deaths associated with it.?
Although the report shows that the former Commissioner had neglected his official duties during his tenure in office, questions have been raised as to why the members of the good governance administration in the CMC that pledged to stop corruption are now demanding the former?s reinstatement???
?We are surprised as to why the UNP councillors are trying to get the Commissioner reinstated despite the allegations levelled against him. Let the accused V.K.A. Anura get his name cleared and take over his former duties. When there is proof as to how Anura was engaged in malpractices, why are the UNP council members trying hard to get him back?? Is it because they too can join the Commissioner and earn a few million rupees before their terms in office lapse?? alleged Gonawala.
?
No tenders?
Gonawala further stated how an enzyme, said to be an odor eliminator, had been purchased by the Commissioner without calling for tenders and checking its efficacy. Millions of rupees had been spent on this exercise.?
Sources from the CMC Payment Branch said that a proposal to supply the questionable odor eliminator had been received by the former Commissioner. The proposal was made by a private supplier from Nugegoda on June 13, 2016. This enzyme- Rydall-OE was to be sprayed to eliminate the odor at the Meetotamulla dump. But later it was revealed that rather than eliminating the odor, the enzyme is used to break waste into molecules and speed up the decay process by hundred percent. This process is alleged to have caused the garbage dump to collapse.
?
Considering the amount of money that had been spent to flatten the garbage dump, it is questionable as to how it collapsed - 
Shamila Gonawala
?
?Once this was sprayed before tragedy struck, it may have sped the decaying process. Since there was no soil in between the garbage layers, the garbage dump may have crashed into the adjoining buildings,? Gonawala opined.??
When contacted councillor Dr. Pradeep Kariyawasam, the former Chief Medical Officer of the CMC, told the Daily Mirror that this enzyme is used to clear blocked sewer pipeline because the blocked particles easily breaks into molecules.
According to Dr. Kariyawasam, before using such an enzyme or a chemical, the Municipal Council has a responsibility to get its efficacy tested in a laboratory and see whether it serves the purpose. ?Without obtaining any such reports, the CMC had purchased this enzyme trusting the supplier?s recommendations,? Dr. Kariyawasam said.? ??
Meanwhile a senior CMC laboratory technician, who wished to remain anonymous, told the Daily Mirror that before purchasing a new chemical or an enzyme there is a process that has to be followed to see whether it is environmentally friendly. ?Just because some party recommends we cannot make any purchase. We have to check whether this has been checked in a local laboratory and its report. We must see whether this product has been granted registration in Sri Lanka and also whether it is an environmental friendly chemical.?
Meanwhile, Chairman Standing Committee on Solid Waste Management at the CMC Mahendra de Silva, at a recent council meeting, has challenged Municipal Councillor Sharmila Gonawala to prove that this enzyme was sprayed on the Meetotamulla dump. If the enzyme was sprayed he is ready to give up his post as councilor as there are no documents with the CMC to prove that Rydall-OE was sprayed on the Meetotamulla garbage dump. It was spayed only on the?Kerawalapitiya dump.
However, a high official at the Colombo Fire Brigade, who wished to remain anonymous, told this newspaper that the CMC cannot claim that this enzyme was not sprayed on the Meetotamulla dump, as it was the Fire Brigade fire trucks that were sent to Meetotamulla to spray this enzyme on the request made by the Solid Waste Engineer Sampath Abeysinghe, who was in charge of the Meetotamulla garbage dump.? ?Let these officials check the Fire Brigade running charts to get an idea of how many bowsers were dispatched to Meetotamulla on the request of Engineer Abeysinghe. We released the bowsers two to three times a week to spray the enzyme,? sources said.
When contacted Engineer Abeysinghe confirmed with this newspaper that Rydall-OE was sprayed on a few occasions on the Meetotamulla dump just before the collapse.? ? ?
Meanwhile, sources from the payment branch further revealed as to how the former Municipal Treasurer K.D. Chitrapala raised concerns regarding this enzyme and made several requests to V.K.A. Anura not to make the purchase as the supplier had presented several misleading facts with regard to the odor controlling enzyme.??
According to the sources, the letter sent on June 13, 2016 by Dilshan Mihiranga, Process Engineer/ Application Specialist of United Glass Lanka (Pvt) Ltd, has stated that spraying Rydall-OE, the eco-friendly, odor eliminator, on the garbage dump is presented as an immediate and sustainable solution to the odor that discharges from the dump. The letter further states how Prof. Nilanthi Bandara, Dr. B.G.N. Sewwandi, Dr. Anuruddha Karunaratne and Dr. U.G. Ratnasiri of Universities of Sri Jayawardenapura, Kelaniya, Peradeniya and Moratuwa respectively will bear testimony to how these odorous gases eliminate through a gas analyzer. However, this claim had been refuted by the above four academics via e-mails when they were contacted by Chitrapala.
?
Professors unaware?
?These four Professors had informed that they were unaware of such an enzyme nor of its effectiveness and that they do not have any connection with the supplier. They had raised their concern regarding the using of their names without their knowledge for business purposes. Chitrapala had informed this to V.K.A. Anura and asked how to trust such a supplier, who had tried to mislead the CMC. Chitrapala did not want to purchase the product without calling for tenders. He had also warned the Accountant (Payment) not to heed any illegal instruction and make payments. He also brought to their notice that if any purchase was done and payments were settled, those who gave the orders and those who implemented them should be responsible to the Government auditors. However the then Commissioner in his reply had noted that he had informed the President and Prime Minister of the necessity to use Rydall-OE in order to offer a long awaited solution to those who were suffering from the odor,? sources alleged.
Meanwhile, in the special Auditor General?s report on Solid Waste Management of the CMC, dated March 16, 2018, has revealed how the former Commissioner was involved in irregularities in making payments to the vehicles hired from a private company to flatten the garbage dump has gone up from 9.7% (comparing with 2010 costs) to 462.9% after V.K.A. Anura took over his duties as the Municipal Commissioner?in 2015.
According to the Audit Report, in 2010 the CMC had spent Rs.42.277 million to hire bulldozers, excavators and tippers to bulldoze the garbage dump while for 2011 the expenditure was Rs.46.411 million. The expenditure for this purpose in the following years is as follows; for 2012 it was Rs.37.573 million, in 2013 it was 48.034 million and in 2014 it was Rs.89.225 million. However, after Anura took over office as the Colombo Municipal Commissioner in January 2015, the hiring charges have skyrocketed. For 2015 the charges were Rs.179.135 million and for 2016 it was 237.999 million.
The report further states that although an excavator and two bulldozers belonging to the CMC too had been used to bulldoze the dump in 2016, the hiring charges had not declined compared to the previous year.
According to the Audit Report, the Government of Japan had donated 12 garbage carriers to the CMC on March 8, 2016. Despite this, the CMC had extended the contract with the company that rented out garbage carriers even though the vehicles donated by Japan were sufficient to collect the city?s garbage.
According to councillor Mahinda Kahandagama, the contract to hire the garbage carriers ended on August 13, 2016 by which time the CMC had received the Japanese donation which sufficed to collect and transport the garbage to Meetotamulla. ?Claiming that it takes time to train the CMC drivers to operate the new Japanese vehicles, the CMC had extended the contract up to June 23, 2017. When running charts were examined by the Government Auditors, they found out that these 12 garbage carriers had been in operation since August 2016 as the officials from the Japanese company had trained our drivers on how to operate the vehicles within a day. Knowing that the CMC drivers had been provided with the necessary training in August 2016, what made the council extend the contract up to June 2017? How many millions have been spent during that period unnecessarily,? queried Kahandagama.?
?
			Anura says he wasn?t involved
			However, refuting allegations, former Commissioner V.K.A. Anura told the Daily Mirror that he was not involved in any irregularity and added that he was waiting to return to the CMC as its Commissioner.
			?My opponents are accusing me of purchasing an odor control enzyme and spraying it on the garbage dump which resulted in it collapsing on April 14, 2017. I request them to show any document to prove that I purchased this enzyme and sprayed it in Meetotamulla.
			There was a proposal from a private company to supply this enzyme to eliminate the odor at Meetotamulla. I planned to purchase this product, but could not,? V.K.A. Anura said. In the backdrop of this denial it is up to the authorities to ascertain the veracity of the claims made in the wider interest of the public.?
			?
			
		
?
Unwanted expenses despite Japanese aid?
Meanwhile the Special Government Audit Report gives details as to how the vehicles had been hired to flatten the dump at a higher charge without following Government procurement guidelines. Questions are asked as to why the CMC extended the contract period to hire garbage collection vehicles despite the council receiving the necessary number of vehicles from the Government of Japan. The former Municipal Commissioner said that during the previous regime, it was the Sri Lanka Army that had provided the vehicles to bulldoze the dump on the instructions of the then Defence Secretary?Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
Anura alleged how the Special Audit Report was prepared by the Auditor General on the request of the former Treasurer K.D. Chitrapala as both are?good friends.
?Because of the friendship between these two, a special Audit Report was released to discredit me. With regard to the irregularities created by few officials at the Council, why do they accuse me? I thoroughly refute the allegations levelled against me in this special Audit Report as I have not done any wrong. I have followed the proper procurement guidelines and Financial Regulations,? Anura added.
?
I request them to show any document to prove that I purchased this enzyme and sprayed it in Meetotamulla. There was a proposal from a private company to supply this enzyme to eliminate the odor at Meetotamulla - 
?
V.K.A. Anura
When asked as to why he issued a letter to prevent preaudits before making any payments, the former Commissioner said that he wanted to correct the internal auditors by ensuring that they don?t carry out audits before payments are made. ?The CMC is the only institution that allows the internal auditors to audit pre-payment vouchers instead of auditing post payment vouchers. There again I have followed Government Financial Regulations,??Anura said.?
According to Anura, the CMC had obtained Army vehicles to bulldoze the dump on the instruction of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. The CMC had only paid the fuel cost to the Army, but not hiring charges. ?That was why the hiring charges during the former regime was very low. But the CMC had stopped obtaining the army vehicles from June 2014 and had to hire them from a private company which was why the prices went up since mid-June 2014,? V.K.A. Anura said.?
Managing Director United Glass Lanka (Pvt) Ltd Bandara Batuwegedara too said that the enzyme that had been used at Meetotamulla a few weeks before the collapse was not supplied by them but had been supplied by an interested party to discredit his company and the product.
?When we gave our proposal, the former Municipal Treasurer tried to underestimate our product. But the treasurer reached us asking for money to evaluate this odor eliminator in order to purchase it. Neither I nor my company would go from the back door and obtain any favourations. So I declined to offer him a bribe. That is why certain CMC members are levelling allegations against this product,? Batuwegedara said.
When asked why they gave the names of four professors to obtain their views of the odor control enzyme to which the four university academics had written to the CMC claiming that they did not know either this product or the company, Batuwegedera said that he has never used their names for any personal benefits, but only made a request to the CMC to ask these specialists to check the chemical and to obtain a report about its efficacy. ?What is wrong in recommending the names of four university academics to get their recommendation on this product? We have neither approached them nor have we spoken to them. We submitted their names and contact details for the easy reference of the CMC,? Batuwegedara claimed.
According to Batuwegedara, he has supplied the enzyme in question to the CMC to be used at the Kerawalapitiya garbage dump for a few months, but added that he does not supply it now.?
All attempts made by the Daily Mirror to contact Colombo Municipal Commissioner Lalith Wickremaratne weren?t successful.?

COUNTRY?S DETERIORATION!!!
	
It seems that no matter, who writes or how often we talk about the various happenings and shortcomings and abuses in this country of ours, there is never an end to what goes on!!! Murder, rape, money laundering, travesties of justice, dictators openly challenging, and worst of all, Minister Samaraweera saying ?There must be a Rule of Law even for criminals?!!! What does he mean by EVEN FOR CRIMINALS?!!! Criminals ARE THE ONES WHO SHOULD HAVE THE MOST STRINGENT RULE OF LAW APPLIED TO THEM!!!?
I read and quote ?We live in a time that core values of the Profession are being threatened. As a result, the whole climate of opinion has become hostile to the legal profession.? This is the LEGAL PROFESSION we are talking about!!! We have highlighted many instances of neglect and crass disregard in the Legal Profession but to absolutely no avail!!! The incident I once spoke about a poor man who has been going to Court for 20 YEARS NOW, 20 YEARS, FOR A LAND CASE, THAT IS STILL NOT RESOLVED!!! WHO GAINS FROM THIS, THE LAWYER AND HOW MANY OTHERS, WE WONDER!!! HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO WRITE ABOUT THESE NUMEROUS ATROCITIES???
We hear that a 15-year-old girl, daughter of a billionaire, has been abducted and raped!!! The 10 suspects responsible for the leopard killing have only been remanded!!! Brothels are operational with no licence, the Police have nothing to say, over to you Mr IGP!!!? ?
Now we are looking at cash and jewellery heists, doping and drug trafficking on the increase, but most outrageous of all I am told are the demands made by the Buddhist clergy NOW to preach Bana and attend a Dana, apparently you are being told how much for the senior priests and how much for the juniors!!! This is not all though, in some cases, you are even given the menu!!!?
Lord Buddha must be regretting the day he brought Buddhism to Sri Lanka!!! Is there anything we can do right in this country??? When it comes to sports, we cannot even play a game right, but resort to ball tampering!!! What has happened to our self-respect, have we no shame, is this really the paucity of our nation???
API, API ONLY
HITLER? These days there is a lot of talk about HITLER!!! We are certainly not happy nor do we condone what HITLER did but there was an underlying reason for it, he did what he did for his own country and people!!! Nevertheless, we condemn what he did!!! Forget about HITLER for the time being; let?s take a look at our local HITLERS, who consider themselves HEROES!!! After we won freedom the leaders we had then in the Senanayake, Kotelawala regimes and other gentlemen of stature made this country the paradise IT WAS!!! Our country subsequently fell into the hands of rogues, who ruled the country for their own benefit!!! One Government after another but all with the same purpose!!! The modus operandi was different but the end result was always the same, API, API, API ONLY, THE COUNTRY IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE!!! ARE YOU NOT WORSE THAN HITLER THEN??? What happened to the ECONOMY, EDUCATION, HEALTH, THE RULE OF LAW AND OTHER ISSUES??? Do the people of this country have a proper lifestyle??? NO!!! The politicians did away with it, they slaughtered that also!!! HITLER loaded trains for Nuremberg, the people of Sri Lanka are now being taken silently and slowly on the same road!!! HITLER did what he did FOR his country and FOR his people, YOU ARE DOING THIS WRONG TO YOUR COUNTRY AND TO YOUR PEOPLE!!!
ALL THE POOR MAN?S MONEY
From the time the ordinary people in this country wake up their thoughts are, how are we going to live, how are we going to get through this day??? YOU POLITICIANS are leading lives of luxury, driving around in luxury vehicles, your wives wear diamond rings and your mistresses drive super vehicles, you eat only the best of food, your children are educated abroad, expensive weddings for your children, medical attention at the best of hospitals, ALL THIS FROM THE POOR MAN?S MONEY THAT YOU COLLECT IN TAXES ISN?T IT??? THEREFORE, YOU ARE WORSE, MUCH WORSE THAN HITLER!!! WHY DON?T YOU COME AND LIVE AMONG THE PEOPLE AND SEE FOR YOURSELVES WHAT THEIR LIVES ARE REALLY LIKE??? When you leave your homes to go to Parliament, take a mirror with you and look at it on the way!!! You will see Hitler complete with a moustache and all!!! The poor children of this country can?t afford the money to go to a local school because the money demanded is so high and our Minister of Education has done nothing about it!!! Our politicians send their children to foreign schools!!! A poor man cannot find the money to buy clothes for his wife and children but it is in this same country that the politicians are giving their wives diamond rings!!! In this country, the poor man has to pawn everything he has to give his sons or daughters in marriage; while the politicians use only the NEW 5 STAR HOTELS TO GIVE THEIR CHILDREN IN MARRIAGE!!! NO EXPENSE IS TOO GREAT!!! Most often the poor man has no money to go to a pharmacy and buy the medicine he desperately needs but the politicians of this country fly to Singapore and America for their treatment!!! The poor man sometimes cannot afford to even put the gasoline and oil he needs into his motorbike; but all of you roam around in your BMWs, BENZ, Audis and other luxury vehicles!!! The salaries the poor people get today are MEAGRE, TOTALLY INSUFFICIENT TO LIVE ON OR PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE FOR THEIR CHILDREN, BUT YOU GUYS WINE AND DINE IN PLUSH 5 STAR HOTELS!!! AREN?T ALL OF YOU SHAMELESS PEOPLE, EVEN WORSE THAN WHAT HITLER WAS???
? ?The late Sir John Kotelawala was a man who practised what he preached and was a well-known pleasure seeker but didn?t swindle the people of this country for his personal benefit!!! He was a Minister for 23 years and Prime Minister for 3 ? years. When he lost the general elections in 1956, he knew it was time to quit, not hanging on unlike our politicians of today are doing, even when they are defeated!!! Sir John and his father before him lived a good life but certainly not at the expense of the citizens of Ceylon!!! When Sir John reached 61 years, his advice to the other politicians was and I quote:
?Fitting in an imprecise proverbial saying, ?there is no fool like an old fool? he once affirmed his belief, ?No man should be called upon to undertake an active part in the affairs of his country once he has passed 65, because ?there is no fool like an old fool!!! All the old fools of this regime would do well to let the young ones do what the old ones are no longer capable of doing!!! Let the young ones take over, they are capable, smart and savvy!!! If the young ones are given a chance now, at least this country will not become ?A CHINESE TAKE AWAY? AS IT IS BEING DUBBED TODAY!!! SADLY, HOWEVER, WE ARE TOLD IT HAS ALREADY BEEN TAKEN!!!

Drug control: Police powers to tri-forces
	
President Maithripala Sirisena, determined to wage a war against drug menace, had decided to draft a Special Provisions Act on Drug Control in order to vest Police Powers to Three-forces within legal limitations, decided by the Attorney General to be effective for a period of two years, Cabinet Spokesman Gayantha Karunathilaka said today.
Minister Karunathilaka said the President Sirisena sought the Cabinet Approval on Tuesday (10) to instruct the Legal Draftsman to draft the Act.
?Rapidly spreading drug menace is a main social as well as economic issue that is faced by Sri Lanka at present. The assistance of the Special Task Force of Sri Lanka Police and the Triforces are obtained by the Narcotic Bureau of the Sri Lanka Police and regional police to further expand their service through avoiding this harmful effects, which spread among elders and the youth community as well,? President Sirisena told the cabinet.
?There has been a steady increase of drug-related arrests and volume of heroin, cannabis and cocaine by Sri Lanka Police from 2015 to 23rd April 2018,? he said.
?This was discussed at the meetings of the Presidential Task Force on Drug Prevention, as well and it has been observed that it is suitable to increase active contribution of the Triforces in order to control the drug trafficking in a successful manner and this task can be made more productive and efficient by giving police powers to officers who engage in drug control operations,? he added.
?Contribution for surveillance of illegal actions, especially the drug control and the task of implementation of the law, have already been made by the Sri Lanka Navy in terms of the provisions available in the Customs Ordinance, Immigration and Emigration Act and Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act,? President Sirisena told the Cabinet. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Govt. will never find any wrong doing of former President: Cabraal
	
While claiming that the Government was attempting to find fault with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, former CB Governor said they would never find any wrong doing of the former President.
He expressed these views at a news briefing held yesterday at the Western Province Aesthetic Resort where they launched a new organization called ?Voice for Justice? with the membership of former secretary to Prime Minister Sirisena Amarasekara, Dr. Nalaka Godahewa, Rohan Weliwita and several others.
Addressing the media, Former CB Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal said the incumbent government was attempting to create some wrong allegations against the opponents of this government.
?We saw how Minister Rajitha Senaratne was saying that he has seen in a document which shows that there is US$ 80 billion in the account of Mahinda Rajapaksa. These are all false,? Cabraal said.
?The Government wants to create a false ideology amongst the general public on certain individuals who have become a threat to this government,? Cabraal added.
He further said the new organization mainly aims at becoming a voice against the organized political victimization that was widely taking placing in this country.
Meanwhile, Dr. Nalaka Godahewa said the underworld was on the rise and the government had been unable to tackle with this issue properly.
?It is clear that the police have been unable to control the underworld because the police have to work according to the whims and fancies of the political agendas,? Dr. Godahewa said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

GR?S PROJECT  AND ?VIYATH MAGA?  INTO THE SEPARATIST MINEFIELD
	
Rejoinder to Rear Admiral Sarath Weerasekara?
Rear Admiral Sarath Weerasekara crucially writes: ?When it became evident that his Dr. Dayan Jayatilleke?s [DJ] sole purpose of getting closer was to push Gotabhaya Rajapaksa [GR] towards 13A, naturally there were objections from others. I was of course one of the main speakers/writers against 13A. When DJ realized that he could not achieve his objective he left GR even without informing him. It is natural for a man to get utterly frustrated when he had miserably failed to date, to push the rulers of the country towards full implementation of 13A.?? ?
Let?s think this through, shall we? If I had failed to convince GR on 13A while Sarath Weerasekara [SW] and the hawks have succeeded, and GR is the Opposition?s Presidential candidate and possibly our?next President;
1. What does he offer as a reformist political solution to the Tamil question?
2. How, with what universally acceptable and credible arguments, does Sri Lanka win the battle of narratives and re-accumulate ?soft power?, stopping its hemorrhage in the international arena?
3. Who are the Northern Tamil takers of any significance he will have, with not even moderates like Devananda and Siddharthan on board??
4. How can the Tamil majority areas be politically governed except with and through a Tamil ally??
5. What happens to the Indo-Lanka Accord and its offspring 13A and the Provincial Council system??
6. How will the small-state unilateralism of ditching/downgrading 13A sit with India??
7. Which country out of 193 will back us in such unilateralism??
8. How does GR persuade India to go back on its entire diplomatic and hard power investment of the 1980s, when it is currently being pressurized by the West and Tamil Nadu to move well beyond it??
The line that SW is taking and the Viyath Maga and Eliya have gone along with, taken together with GR?s silence, fill me with the grim foreboding that we are headed along the route that Milosevic of Serbia and Mikhail Shakashvili of Georgia respectively took?a unilateralist route that is especially unviable with a large ethnic kin state as your neighbor. It can only end horribly badly and to your own country?s conclusive and irreversible detriment.? ?
To move to nonsense which verges on the moronic, SW refers to the ?hardcore federalists such as DJ who argue that 13A is the only answer?. In another paragraph he calls me ?separatist?. SW?s ignorance is so vast that he thinks that ?hardcore federalists? support 13 A and 13A supporters are hardcore federalists or worse, separatists! 13A is precisely devolution within a unitary state. SW obviously does not know the difference between devolution/autonomy and federalism, not to mention devolution, federalism and separatism. 13A is convertible to federalism if the executive Presidency is removed, but that is one of the reasons why I have been an early and prominent critic of any idea of removing the executive Presidency.? ?
I have never advocated the ?full? implementation of 13A, but only ?the implementation of 13A? as the Government of Sri Lanka, including President Mahinda Rajapaksa [MR], Gotabhaya, Basil and Lalith Weeratunga promised India during the war and in its immediate aftermath in May 2009. This promise was made to the Govt. of India as well as the UN Secretary-General in official?Joint Communiques.? ?
I have never once advocated ?full implementation? in print or on the public record. I support graduated and phased implementation based on MR?s instructions to his negotiating team in 2011 at Foreign Minister Prof. GL Pieris? residence ( a meeting at which I was a participant) that the negotiations should be based on the 13th amendment and should arrive at a compromise on the Concurrent List which would involve swaps.? ?
Now to the blatant lies. He writes that ?I approached GR and joined Viyath Maga.? I was invited to a dinner meeting at the 80 Club by some professionals and academics with whom we had worked in the 2015 campaign, and Viyath Handa invited me to speak at a seminar or two, which I did. I never joined either Viyath Maga or Viyath Handa. Indeed I declined to attend the opening of the Viyath Maga office explaining that the ideology and profile of Viyath Maga was not of a sort I could be associated with.? ?
I was taken to see GR by Udaya Gammanpila and Wimal Weerawansa last year. It was their idea. I liked him, and found him sharp, realistic, and receptive. When he invited me to speak on foreign policy at the first major Viyath Maga meeting at the Golden Rose, Boralesgamuwa, I readily agreed. Unfortunately for SW, the film footage of my speech opens with a clear statement by me that I am NOT a member of Viyath Maga -- so much for seeking membership! Now why does he think I said that, thereby differentiating?myself publicly?? ?
SW says ?we know that DJ is anti-Buddhist. When he was the Ambassador to France the first thing he did was to remove the Buddha statue kept at the reception of the embassy office.?? ?
SW refers to the ?hardcore federalists such as DJ who argue that 13A is the only answer
	He obviously does not know the difference between devolution/autonomy and federalism
	I never joined either Viyath Maga or Viyath Handa. Indeed I declined to attend the opening of the Viyath Maga office
Well, one of the first things DJ did as an ?anti-Buddhist? when he took over as ambassador to France and UNECO, was to organize a global conference at UNESCO in record time, to celebrate the Sambuddathva Jayanthi. It was on the theme ?The Contribution of the Thought of the Buddha to Universality, Humanism and Peace?.?
It is true that I removed the Buddha statue from the office room of the ambassador and transferred it to a position of honour in my official residence. It had been put there by my immediate predecessor in the ambassador?s office which previously never had one. One of my most distinguished predecessors, Prof. Senaka Bandaranaike, a renowned scholar on our archaeology and ancient history, did not have the Buddha statue in his office in Paris ?with very good reason. France is the most secular state on earth. I did not substitute the Buddha statue with any other?I removed all religious symbolism from the ambassador?s office where I represented my country in a state that was secular, in which I had to fight the battle of narratives.? ?
SW says ?DJ also had the audacity to prohibit playing our National Anthem at the Independence Day reception held at the embassy in Paris. It is up to the public to decide whether a man who has no respect to his country?s identity and the National Anthem is fit to represent the country.?? ?
Now this is a Goebbelsian lie, so typical of SW. The National Anthem was sung, in Sinhala, on both National day celebrations that took place when I was ambassador.? ?
Finally, to Geneva. Completely unknown to me as Prof. Rajiva Wijesinha will attest, two meetings took place in postwar Colombo with an Indian delegation and the UN Secretary General at which the country?s leadership signed joint communiques agreeing to ?proceed with the implementation of the 13A?. On a conference call, the then Foreign Minister and Foreign Secretary instructed me to ?stick to the language of the text of the Joint Communiques? in drafting our Resolution. That Resolution was thoroughly scrutinized and endorsed by the Senior Legal Advisor of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Dr. Rohan Perera (currently our PR in New York), the members of the AG?s team Shavindra Fernando and Yasantha Kodagoda,Minister of Human Rights Mahinda Samarasingha and his Secretary, Prof Rajiva Wijesinha. Minister Samarasinghe was in constant touch with Colombo.?
I was sacked six weeks after our victory probably because I took that promise made on the implementation of 13A seriously, and knew that our credibility and alliances would suffer (as they did) if it was thought that we had reneged on it, and therefore kept urging its implementation. I was also probably sacked because of my critique of Israel?s Gaza war. Now these are not two contradictory reasons but one?because the lobby that is anti 13A/anti-power sharing is also the hawkish pro-Netanyahu lobby. That was so then, in postwar 2009, and it is so now.? ?

?
At long last, the Group 16 formally joined forces with the JO group! It was a long-looked -for happy event for some of them. The former strongman visibly in high spirits made it a point to express his pleasure at the presence of his loyalist from the Gampaha political family too on the occasion.
?
The meeting over, the former strongman invited the journalists impatiently waiting outside to enter the hall. He also told them that the JO stalwart from Gampaha too was present.
In fact, the focus of the journalists as well as photographers was the Gampaha politico and they were all looking for him. Because it was public knowledge that the Gamapaha politico was dead against the proposed marriage between the Group 16 and the JO and he had launched a tirade against the Group 16 in public even a few days earlier.
However, the media hawks found to their disappointment that the Gampaha politico had vanished from the scene!
Later it transpired that the Gampaha politico had quietly made his exit through the rear entrance of the hall because he knew that the media crowd was out to question him about his volte-face on the issue of the JO accommodating the Group 16 in its fold!?

Indian top court hears challenge to gay sex ban
	
?
REUTERS, 10th JULY, 2018
India?s top court on Tuesday began hearing arguments challenging a colonial-era law banning homosexuality, and activists said they were optimistic it would be overturned it despite opposition from some ruling lawmakers.
The Supreme Court hearing comes around five years after it reinstated a ban on gay sex - still considered taboo by many in socially conservative India - following a four-year period of decriminalization. Lawyers for the petitioners challenging the law said the homosexuality rule - dating from 1861, when India was under British rule - represented outdated Victorian morals and stifled individual rights. ?As society changes, values change,? Mukul Rohatgi, a senior lawyer appearing for the lead petitioner, told a bench of five judges. ?What was moral 160 years ago might not be moral today.?
Tushar Mehta, additional solicitor-general for the government, said he would present the state?s views on the issue in further hearings. The court will likely resume the hearing on Wednesday.
The Indian homosexuality law, commonly known as ?Section 377?, prohibits ?carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal? - which is widely interpreted to refer to homosexual sex. Gay sex is punishable by up to 10 years in jail, but enforcement is uncommon. The law is, however, used to harass and blackmail gay people, activists say.
Lawyers for the petitioners argued that sexual orientation and gender were not matters of choice and that orientation was an intrinsic part of individual identity.

Introduce formula to increase salaries as well: JVP
	
The Government should introduce a formula to increase the salaries of Public and Private Sector employees every two months, in line with the fuel price increase, as people found it difficult to manage their salaries with the escalating Cost of Living, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today.
JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva told a news conference that the people were unaware of the formula to increase fuel prices and urged the Government to reveal it to the people.
He said the Government should reveal the reason behind the fuel price increase as the fuel prices had neither gone up in the world market nor the Government had introduced a new tax.
?Fuel prices in the world market had not gone up. Fluctuation in the prices by US$ cents cannot be considered a price increase. The Government is trying to justify the burden on people by hiding behind the formula on fuel prices. Fuel prices had gone up due to excessive taxes imposed by the Government,? he said.
He said prices of all commodities may go up again, including bus fares, transport costs, fishery and agricultural produce due to the fuel price increase.
?The Government has no clear economic policy. The country is engulfed in debt-trap again. The Government is selling State property rather than developing industries in the country,? he said.
Mr. Silva said the JVP had organized a protest campaign against the fuel price increase on July 16 and 17 throughout the country. (Ajith Siriwardana)

While the uproar over Kala madam?s controversial statement was raging drowning all other issues in the country, a news story in a section of the Press that the Green boss had asked Number One to relieve the lady of her portfolio made headlines.?
?
Soon after this story had appeared, the offices of the Big Two had been bombarded with queries whether the story was true.?
The aides of Number One finding that there was no end to these queries had asked the latter whether he had received such a request. And the reply had been a firm ?No?. When the interested parties inquired from Number Two, he too had denied having made such a request to Number One.?
It transpired later that the news story was a consummate fabrication concocted for political reasons.?
The fact that the much-maligned lady made a statement a few days later that she had sent in her resignation may, perhaps, have given a sense of much relief to whoever made up the story,?

Medical Tourism in Sri Lanka- Are We Ready Yet?
	
A patient walks in to a hospital in Singapore with a swollen and painful knee. MRI scans are done and in an instant an Indian radiologist based in Bangalore goes through all the images. The reports are prepared within a day and by evening the patient gets an expert opinion on his knee by an internationally acclaimed radiologist living in India.? ?
In another part of the globe, an American patient who requires plastic surgery plans on consulting a clever surgeon in Thailand. He visits Bangkok and as a part of the surgical package receives a bonus ?Explore Thailand? tour during the post-operative period.? ?
If you think that these two scenarios are from the future you are wrong. ?Teleradiology Solutions? Bangalore is one of the leading companies which provide radiology reports. It serves many hospitals all over the world including Singapore General Hospital.Teleradiology analyses thousands of radiology images per month. Only an internet connection is used for the above service.?
Sri Lanka has the skilled medical workforce to start medical tourism big time. We also have the tourism attractions to capture the hearts of all medical tourists
?Bumrungrad Hospital Bangkok serves 1.1 million patients every year out of which the majority are from different parts of the globe including USA. This hospital boasts of more than 200 USA accredited doctors. Medical tourism is one of the fastest developing industries in Asia and it?s a fine way of making use of the elite medical workforce in any country. This is also a great method of bringing in foreign revenue to a country. So what keeps Sri Lanka and medical tourism apart? I will briefly highlight a few reasons why medical tourism is still far from reality here.??
First of all if we do an analysis of countries which have abundant ?Medical Tourists?, USA might emerge as number one. For the American citizens to reimburse their medical costs through insurance schemes we should offer our services accordingly. Even a piece of gauze used to cover a surgical wound has defined specifications and dimensions in their insurance acts. We have to embrace these guidelines at least to a certain extent.??
The doctors who offer their services should have recognition from the said country.(i.e. An American qualified Sri Lankan doctor) In both instances I have cited above, the specialists are US qualified local doctors. This might be an issue in Sri Lanka where most doctors receive specialist training in either UK or Australia. And most non specialist doctors are usually locally qualified graduates without degrees from other countries.??
This is also a great method of bringing in foreign revenue to a country
To attract medical tourists there?s a lot that needs to be done in the local tourism industry. Take for an example accessibility for disabled patients. Still the majority of hotels lack even wheelchair ramps at the entrance. And about transporting a wheel chair bound patient - we do not have vehicles with wheel chair hoists or wheelchair accessible vehicles for the patients to drive themselves. The old fashioned method of lifting a disabled patient in to a vehicle seat is now historical. If we consider major tourist attractions very few buildings/ venues are meant for disabled patients.? ?
Sri Lanka has the skilled medical workforce to start medical tourism big time. We also have the tourism attractions to capture the hearts of all medical tourists. In a country which is struggling with just raw material and labour export, medical tourism utilizing professional expertise might be the way forward. The need of the hour is a group of individuals willing to steer this concept to an ultimate success.??

?Miracle or science??
	
On Monday the British-led rescue mission resumed with four more boys from the Wild Boars football team extracted to safety through miles of claustrophobic underground tunnels??
?
All 12 boys and their soccer coach trapped for more than two weeks deep inside a flooded Thai cave have been rescued, a Thai navy SEAL unit said on Tuesday, a successful end to a perilous mission that gripped the world.
?We are not sure if this is a miracle, a science, or what. All the thirteen Wild Boars are now out of the cave,? the SEAL unit said on its Facebook page, adding all were safe.
The ?Wild Boars? soccer team, aged between 11 and 16, and their 25-year-old coach became trapped on June 23 while exploring the cave complex in the northern province of Chiang Rai after soccer practice and a rainy season downpour flooded the tunnels.
British divers found the 13, hungry and huddled in darkness on a muddy bank in a partly flooded chamber several kilometres inside the complex, on Monday last week.
After pondering for days how to get the 13 out, a rescue operation was launched on Sunday when four of the boys were brought out, tethered to rescue divers.
Another four were rescued on Monday and the last four boys and the coach were brought out on Tuesday.
Celebrations will be tinged with sadness over the loss of a former Thai navy diver who died on Friday while on a re-supply mission inside the cave.
The last five were brought out of the cave on stretchers, one by one over the course of Tuesday, and taken by helicopter to hospital.
Three members of the SEAL unit and an army doctor, who has stayed with the boys since they were found, were the last people due to come out of the cave, the unit said.

Navodaya helps  differently abled kids smile
	
When we see someone, especially a child who is mentally or physically disabled, we immediately feel sorry for him or her. We make utterances like ?aney pau? or ?sin? when we see this type of child. Some however, feel disgusted and turn away or make rude comments about them. The stigma associated with such individuals is still very much prevalent in society. Although people say that they aren?t judgemental about others, these statements are automatic responses. What we don?t always realise is that sometimes all what these differently abled people want is acceptance.? ?
Having full of passion to make the differently abled individuals be accepted as equals, face society and live happily, Lakshmi Karunajeewa in 2006 spoke to a monk at the Karagampitiya temple requesting for space to start the Navodaya Special Children?s Foundation. The foundation is a non-profit school and she planned to teach such students the basics of looking after themselves and living in society. She was informed by the monk that there was an unused garage space that she could use temporarily. So, she decided to establish her foundation there. Within two weeks a relative of a colleague was able to bring a student to the foundation.? ?
The Expansion
As the number of students at the school reached 15 and in the face of growing difficulties, for the want of space, Lakshmi was forced to move her school into the living room of her home. Despite all this, she continued with her work and put together a concert. The children currently enrolled at her school were able to perform and showcase their talents at the concert. A member of the audience, who resides in Canada, was struck by reality of the situation the children are in. She put Rs 1 lakh into the bank account of the school. With this greatly appreciated donation Lakshmi was able to start looking for another place where she could continue with her school. But when she told land owners the nature of the work, that she was involved with children, she was asked to pay an enormous rent for a very small space. Eventually, she was able to find a small space which was affordable. It was located at a convenient place.? ?
Lakshmi and her team of 10 teachers teach these children how to look after themselves and live happily
Now the student population numbers 48 and the students are aged between 2 and 17. The school includes slow learners and children with mental illnesses such as Down?s Syndrome and Autism. Lakshmi and her team of 10 teachers teach these children how to look after themselves and live happily. The skills that are taught range from brushing their teeth to helping out around the house; where the students are made to chip in with cleaning and cooking. Besides acquiring basic life skills, the children are also given special medical attention by renowned therapists who treat them in the fields of physiotherapy, speech therapy and OT therapy.? ?
School sessions
During a typical school day the students start at 7.30 a.m. The children are pooled into 3 classes and have 40 minute periods during which they are taught skills such as how to write their name, simple math skills, religion and social life skills. Many of these kids cannot speak, hence the teachers teach them how to communicate by pointing at pictures or objects. Sign language is also used in the class. These kids are also given the opportunity to take part in extra-curricular activities like art competitions, dramas, dances among other activities. Navodaya Special Children?s Foundation also provides these students with lunch and morning tea as well as school uniforms.? ?
The foundation also provides an opportunity to parents to have one-to-one meetings with teachers. During these meetings the teachers discuss the progress made by the children. The teachers also explain to the parents as to what they can do to help their children when at home. Many kids, who received the foundation for their education at Navodaya, are now studying at local schools. Some teachers are assisting organizations by shadowing their workers, so that they can acquire the skills needed to fulfill responsibilities at their places of employment.? ?
Running an organization of this nature leads to many problems, the most obvious being the lack of funding. The staff at Navodaya often find it difficult to obtain the materials required to teach the children. Much finances are needed to settle payments which come in the form of rent and salaries of the employees. Further, they encounter the continuous stigma which the children and their parents have to live with. Whether it is coming to school by bus or engaging in another activity, these parents are often asked why their child is born this way?? There are occasions when passersby offer them money.
The foundation also provides an opportunity to parents to have one-to-one meetings with teachers. During these meetings the teachers discuss the progress made by the children
These acts are demeaning to the family and makes it difficult for them to face the society. The staff at Navodaya strive to reduce the stigma associated with the disabilities of these students. These teachers encourage people to spend time with the children and also help out in the activities of the school. Students from The British School In Colombo and S. Thomas? College drop in when possible and support Navodaya in every way possible. Efforts are also made to raise funds through the involvement of Interact Clubs. These clubs arrange school fund raising events on behalf of Navodaya. Some volunteers have also dedicated their time and efforts to help the children be happy and stay connected with the society.? ?
With the help of such people Navodaya has been able to thrive and improve the services its offers. Its website www.navodayalanka.org further explains the philosophy behind the foundation and the services that are provided by the school.? ?
Future
Lakshmi?s dream for the school is growing bigger. Her dream of having a permanent residence for the children, engaging the children in vocational training projects and conducting awareness programmes on the rights of a person with a disability needs to be fulfilled.?
If you were moved by reading about the services the Navodaya staff is? providing these children, lend a helping hand in whatever way you can and bring a smile to the face of a child. Your contributions will help them lead a normal, happy life and face society with their heads held high.? ? ?

Paying tax for vehicles not needed if annual income less than Rs. 500,000: IRD Chief
	
Taxpayers whose annual income is less than Rs. 500,000 per year, need not pay additional taxes for owning a vehicle, Inland Revenue Department (IRD) Commissioner Ivan Dissanayake said.
He told the Daily Mirror that some media institutions had misinterpreted a speech he had made recently.
He said people who live a luxury life and make seven or eight trips abroad a year should open a tax file with the IRD.
Persons who open tax files and work in the private sector with an annual income that exceed Rs. 500,000 will have their taxes automatically deducted from them by the Department. Upon deduction, no other taxes will be charged from them even if they own vehicles.
?However, there are businessmen who own multiple vehicles who evade paying taxes and there are also those who drive luxury and super luxury vehicles. Their incomes often exceed Rs. 500,000. So, they should open a tax file and pay their taxes,? Mr Dissanayake said.
?Several airlines had informed the IRD about air tickets being sold at higher rates as most of the people travel overseas during the school holidays,? Commissioner Dissanayake said.
?Therefore, I requested those people to open tax files considering their annual income,? he said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Prez says will sign execution order, if convicts continued trade
	
President Maithripala Sirisena said that he would sign required orders to execute capital punishment for convicted drug traffickers, who carried out large-scale drug smuggling operations, while in detention.
?Although there are deferent opinions regarding capital punishment in a Buddhist society, if a large number of criminal acts spread in such a society despite religious sermons, it will be necessary to take some timely actions to control crime,? he said.
The President made this statement at the opening of the ?Schools to Boost Fight Against Drugs? campaign at Gatambe Grounds in Kandy today (July 11). This programme has been organized by the National Drugs Eradication Campaign and the Presidential Task Force Against Drugs with the intention of saving school children from the menace of drugs.
President Sirisena said that although the opponents level undue criticism, the number of crimes and rapes has dropped during the last three years. He pointed out that the report on crime in the last 10 years presented to the National Security Council yesterday has revealed that false propaganda about an increase of crime rates after this Government came to power was carried out by the opponents with political agendas.
However, pointing out that some social websites and use of illegal drugs have caused an increase in murders and rapes, the President said that it is the responsibility of the Government as well as the parents to give priority to save children from these evils.
President Sirisena pointed out that the children should be made aware of the dangers of drugs and make them the messengers of creating a drug-free society.
The President presented awards to those who made special contributions to the success of the campaign against drugs and alcohol.
On this occasion, the President made a contribution of Rs 2 million to Vice Chancellor of Peradeniya University, Prof. Upul Dissanayake for construction of an Oral Cancer Treatment Unit at the Medical Department.

Rs. 13.5 bn to bail out SriLankan Airlines
	
Two state banks - the Bank of Ceylon and the People?s Bank ? will extend financial assistance of Rs.13.5 billion to bail out the cash-strapped SriLankan Airlines, it is learnt.
Public Enterprise Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella submitted the Cabinet memorandum in this regard. Earlier, the bank interests, accrued over a period of time, accounts for a bulk of the total losses of the national career.
It is learnt that the two state banks will issue the Letters of Comfort in this regard soon.
However, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera, in his observation on the Cabinet paper, has stressed the need to restructure the national career or to find a new investor for the development of it. He is reported to have said that this will be the last time for the State banks to give such financial assistance.
SriLankan Airlines lost US$ 105 million of Rs.16 billion for the last financial year. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) also recommended the government to restructure the national career.
A top-level committee, appointed by the government to look at the financial situation of the airline, has recommended the fleet and route rationalization along the laying off of the staff. (Kelum Bandara)

Six fishermen were stranded in their trawler 295 nautical miles east of Trincomalee, since this morning after they had sailed from Beruwala, the Radio Unit of the Department of Fisheries said.
Meanwhile, another fishing boat was reported stranded due to engine trouble about 650 nautical miles south of Galle.
The Fisheries Department said the first trawler was in distress due to an engine failure and was dragged Eastward due to strong currents.
The Fisheries Department said that it had informed maritime authorities of Indonesia, the Andaman Islands and the Maldives about the stranded of the trawler.
The Department said that another boat of the same owner had already gone to rescue the broken trawler.
However, due to high winds and rough sea, the boats are pulled towards Indonesia.
?We have informed the Sri Lanka Navy about the boat and Navy Media Spokesman Commander Dinesh Bandara said they had located the trawler and it was 295 nautical miles away from Trincomalee in the international waters,? A Fisheries Department official said.

## Title: Sri Lankans beware? do you want yesteryear?s rejects?
## Section: Opinion

Sri Lankans beware? do you want yesteryear?s rejects?
	
New York Times says its Lanka reporters under threat
?I don?t think the intelligence reports are all that hot. Some days I get more out of the New York Times.?~ John F Kennedy
Mahinda Rajapaksa has shown, if the reports are correct, that he has not changed at all; no repentance, no apologies and definitively not divorced from untruths.
Following is a report as it appeared in the local news media:
?Colombo: The New York Times on Tuesday said that two of its correspondents in Sri Lanka have been threatened by the loyalists of the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa after it published an investigative report last week on China allegedly funding his 2015 election campaign. The report alleged that Rajapaksa?s campaign took millions in bribes from a Chinese state-owned company which built the controversial Hambantota port on?the island.
In a press statement, the NYT said that a group of Sri Lankan parliamentarians allied to Rajapaksa held a news conference recently to publicly criticize the two journalists who contributed logistical assistance to a rigorously reported and accurate investigation into the Hambantota port, published by it on June 26. ?It is unacceptable for journalists to be intimidated this way. This action appears intended to silence critics and curb press freedoms, and ultimately deprive Sri Lankans of information in the public interest,? it added.
During the 2015 Sri Lankan elections, large payments from the Chinese port construction fund flowed directly to campaign aides and activities for Mr. Rajapaksa, who had agreed to Chinese terms at every turn and was seen as an important ally in China?s efforts to tilt influence away from India in South Asia, the report had said. Rajapaksa, who ruled the island nation for a decade from 2005 to 2015, had dismissed the report as false propaganda against him by the government.
Media personnel are scrupulously aware that truth and freedom are valuable commodities that should not be bartered away for a mere grant of a laptop..
If Mr Rajapaksa takes issue with Times reporting, we have encouraged him to contact senior editors at the New York Times rather than intimidating Sri Lankan journalists, the release issued by NYT International Editor Michael Slackman said and urged the Sri Lankan authorities to ensure safety of journalists working for NYT or any other news organization.
Meanwhile, Rajapaksa?s son Namal, a lawmaker, came out in his support claiming that ?at no time? his father had intimidated the journalists. ?Just like the press has a right to criticize politicians, don?t we also have the right to ?publicly criticize? reporting we believe to be faulty?? he tweeted. During Rajapaksa?s decade-long rule, 17 journalists and media employees were reportedly murdered in the country?.
This is a grim reminder of the ?state and privately-sponsored? and countless injustices and slaughters committed on free media personnel by a ruling clan that was led by the Rajapaksa family and their corrupt and coldblooded subordinates. If the Rajapaksas attempt to play around with New York Times, one of the most prestigious newspapers in the world, and hallucinate about coming out scot-free, think again.
All authoritarian rulers hate free media. Free media is a thorn in their flesh that is discharging a stench of deceit, corruption and political malpractice. And that is one institution the current Sri Lankan government has, among others, re-established after assuming power in 2015. The unprecedented freedom and liberty to criticize and hurl many a barb, either true or otherwise, justifiably or unjustifiably, at the present rulers exercised by the current crop of media personnel cannot be underestimated, nor should it be taken for granted. That fierce truth is being established and re-established, again and again by the successor-government to the Rajapaksa junta. And that government is being led by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. That truth has no equal in modern post-Independence Sri Lanka. With the overflow of some outrageous material in the social media, which seems to have no ethical or legal boundaries, the alertness of politicians has turned sharper and they too have resorted to creating and maintaining their own Twitter and Facebook accounts.
the journalists attached to New York Times newspaper would not publish anything that was not confirmed by at least three independent sources.
It is against such an enlightened backdrop the Rajapaksas and their notorious henchmen are alleged to have gone back to their usual pastime of harassing and intimidating media personnel who have chosen to exercise their Fundamental Rights and obligation of writing and expressing their informed and educated opinions on matters as they choose to do so. In that vein, media personnel are scrupulously aware that truth and freedom are valuable commodities that should not be bartered away for a mere grant of a laptop computer or a free meal at the Temple Trees. Freedom of expression is a fundamental human right.
US journalists are used to exercising their right to seek out the truth about any and all matters relating to any and all. Their right to Freedom of Expression is guaranteed by the First Amendment to their Constitution. Nurtured by such a free will, the journalists attached to New York Times newspaper would not publish anything that was not confirmed by at least three independent sources. In such a circumstance, the anger and ire emanating from the Rajapaksas is natural and precariously centred on convincing themselves more than anything else.
Yet, if the allegations are found to be true and bearing evidentiary facts, the Rajapaksas have done unto themselves some irreparable damage in that, such action by them have cemented the arguments and accusations about their dishonourable rule and the immense wealth they are alleged to have accumulated for themselves and their close political adjutants. But what rises from the New York Times report is not really the content of such allegations; the rash and ill-thought out response by them is more applicable in the current context of the local political dynamics. It was indeed a forbidding reminder of their past ruling enterprise. The bold and ugly reaction to reportage of an alleged political malpractice and self-enrichment via a foreign country and tolerance of an external government which is tantamount to betrayal of the fundamental oath of the office of presidency should be told again and again so that the local population would be more enlightened when they ponder as to for which party they intend to vote next time.
This is a grim reminder of the ?state and privately-sponsored? and countless injustices and slaughters committed on free media personnel by a?ruling clan ...
Yet one must bear in mind that United States of America (USA) as a foreign government also has a huge amount of vested interest in exposing such a vile act of corruption. That vested interest drives the US government, as the only superpower in the twenty first century, to unforeseen lengths to curb the influence, if any, of the People?s Republic of China (PRC), the only Asian competitor to the USA, militarily and economically. The geopolitics of this convoluted equation is unfathomably deep and inexplicably consequential. Yet the purpose of this column is not to examine the intricate policy differences and rhetorical heat between USA and PRC. This column is making an effort to tell a different yet more rivetingly relevant and dangerous phenomenon, if allowed to go unspoken of and uninvestigated, which poses a clear and present danger to the advances our country has made during the last two and half years in media freedom, in particular, and freedom of expression in general.
The audacity of the Rajapaksas to ask the local voter population to forget their past malpractices and give them another chance is laughable on one hand and terribly treacherous on the other. In their haste to rid themselves of the malevolent accusations catalogued in the New York Times piece, they had apparently resorted to their time-tested means of challenging the accusations- physical thuggery and intimidation. In the rash rush to his defence, Mahinda Rajapaksa seems to have committed an unpardonable act of idiocy and misplaced sense of arrogance. Arrogance, if shown in a more appropriate circumstance, could be forgivable, taking into account the position one held in the past and the unforgiving fate which intervenes that process and takes that position away from the holder. Mahinda Rajapaksa may have lost his cool (not that he was known for any cool and stoicism) and in that status of being out of control of his wits and steadiness, ordered his thuggish supporters to do the needful.
Therein lies the danger; therein dwells the evidence of the cruel and naked intentions of authoritarian rulers. The Stalinist principle of physically destroying political enemies has been proven politically wrong and morally reprehensible. What reinforces the desire to pursue power in these power-hungry politicos is the apathy on the part of the general population. That apathy kills, unless it is immediately recognized as sheer impotence and not equanimity as it may have?
been interpreted.
Leonard Woolf, about the state of circumstance when Punchi Menika had her first experience of sexual intercourse with Babun in his illustrious novel Village in the Jungle, wrote most elegantly and his description of the near rape through which a young man, Babun, claims Punchi Menika as his mate??a cry broke from her, in which, joy and desire mingled with the fear and the pain?.
A majority of Sri Lankans had the desire and joy when the war against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam (LTTE) was won but when the so-called fathers of the victory passed the 18th Amendment to our Constitution and began toying with lives of the average men and women, they realized that that desire and joy inexplicably mingled with fear and pain.

A long-standing loyalist of the former Madam, this Diyawanna politico at state level from Gampaha is widely considered a Blue party stalwart in the district.
?
Now that the general polls are around the corner, the politico held a meeting of the party?s electorate level organization to meet the party?s rank and file to feel their pulse.?
A good number of party activists and supporters had turned up at this meeting, but what most of them told him gave the politico a jolt: ?Sir, we?ve come out of our respect for you. But we have now decided to back Pohottuwa. If you need our continued support, please join the Pohottuwa party.?
The politico thanked them for being frank with him and told them that he too would like to be equally frankly with them.?
He told them that he had already decided to join the heritage party. ?The leader of this party holds an influential position in this government and this party has entered into a political alliance with the core party of yahapalanaya. And as a member of this party, I hope to get nomination to contest under the banner of this alliance at the coming general polls.?
The party activists and supporters expressed their surprise at his decision, but not their support or endorsement, they say.?

Taxi meters compulsory after August 1
	
Meters with the capability of issuing printed bills would be compulsory from August 1, the National Council for Road Safety (NCRF) said.
NCRF Chairman Dr Sisira Kodagoda told the Daily Mirror that all three-wheelers used for passenger transport should have meters.
?After August 1, the regulation would be strictly implemented and stern legal action will be taken against the passenger transport three-wheelers for not having fare meters,? he said.
He said they should issue printed bills to passengers indicating the distance, fare, charge per kilometre, taxi and the driver details.
?Or else the taxi drivers can have their own bill book printed giving all the above-mentioned details.?
The rule was to be implemented in January 2017, but due to several requests made by three-wheeler associations, the implementation date was postponed
?The Traffic Police had been instructed to book the three-wheelers which do not comply with the regulation,? he said.
?Spot fine is not allowed anymore and fine will be decided after producing the three-wheeler driver in court,? Mr Kodagoda said.
He the taxi-meters was also being manufactured according to SLS standards.
?We cannot interfere with the manufacturing process but the meters should be made according to the given specifications,? Dr Kodagoda said.
?The maximum cost for a meter should be less than Rs.10, 000. The manufacturers should sell the meters on flexible payment schemes,? he said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

## Title: The Debt Trap

The Debt Trap
	
The leaders of the so-called Yahapalana Government painted a rosy picture through providing concessions to the people for a few months soon after assuming office. They also had a? mini-budget the same month they came to power. However, they have since been lamenting about a huge debt burden they had inherited from the former regime led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and attributing their failure in keeping their election promises to the same debts, especially the ones drawn from foreign countries.
The most important issue in respect of foreign debt is that both the leaders of the Government, President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had said that the Government was unaware of the real amount of monies the country owed to other countries.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe told the Parliament last year that the Government did not know the exact amount of foreign debt as so many loans the country had obtained from various countries had not been properly documented.
President Sirisena also had stated in January this year that more than $ 58 billion ? approximately Rs. 9 trillion - or ninety per cent of foreign loans borrowed by the previous Government were unaccounted for in Finance Ministry records.
Despite there being disagreement among the financial circles about the amount the President had referred to, the fact remains that both leaders of the Government had complained about the absence of proper records on foreign loans. It has been attributed to so many Government institutions having borrowed money independently from foreign sources. Apart from this now it is said that the country has been caught in a debt trap.
In fact, this is not a new phenomenon in spite of the term debt-trap being used since lately by Western Analysts, especially to vilify China?s financial intervention in many developing countries.
US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had stated recently that Beijing ?encourages dependency using opaque contracts, predatory loan practices, and corrupt deals that trap more nations in debt and undercut their sovereignty, denying them their long-term, self-sustaining growth. The Western analysts go on to call this ?debt-trap diplomacy.?
However, responding to these allegations a spokesman from the Chinese Embassy in Colombo, Luo Chong told media days ago Sri Lanka was caught in a debt trap but not by China.
?I also stress that Sri Lanka is indeed trapped, not by Chinese but by the lack of development due to historical and external reasons? Some foreign forces, without willingness or abilities to help, are fabricating lies, only trying to obstruct the joint development of China and other developing countries including Sri Lanka and keep Sri Lanka in the trap of poverty.?
Years ago the two main parties had been competing in getting financial assistance from the Western sources, especially from the World Bank (WB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) after coming to power alternately. At the same time, the same two parties with their smaller allies criticized the Governments in power for ?mortgaging the country? to the WB and the IMF.
Indeed it was a mortgage since those loans entailed conditions such as privatization and pruning of funds for the welfare of the people. Besides, those loans have failed to minimize the country?s dependency.
In fact, the country had thus been in a debt trap for the past several decades. Whether China is involved in ?debt-trap diplomacy? or not, Mr Luo Chong?s above argument that Sri Lanka is trapped because of lack of development due to historical and external reasons is undeniable. One might recollect the famous allegation by founder leader of the JVP Rohana Wijeweera during 1982 Presidential election that Sri Lanka was obtaining loans on interest to pay the interest of the previous loans (Naye poliya gewanna poliyata naya gannawa). That indicates the country having been trapped by foreign debt even in those days.
The Opposition - whichever party it may be - always would accuse the Government of pushing the country into the foreign economic grip by obtaining unproductive loans. Hambantota Port project is the best case in point. The Joint Opposition is now levelling the same allegation against the incumbent Government that had been levelled by the UNP against the?previous Government.
Politicians in Sri Lanka who make decisions must have an independent view on the nature of the foreign loans the country obtains, without preferring to look at the issue through their?political prism.

The sun shines  on mango farmers  of Minuwangoda
	
It?s possible that any kind of fruits, rice, cereals or vegetable that we buy from the market may have been ripened due to the use of chemicals or any other preservatives. These chemicals are used to either ensure that these food items are preserved for a long time or to obtain a good harvest.? ?
It has been reported by the Health Authorities that there is an increase in the percentage of the patients suffering from non communicable diseases. This condition may be caused specially because of the consumption of fruits, cereals, vegetables, rice and various food items which contain chemicals. How much would you fancy to taste a naturally ripe mango, a pineapple, an orange, a guava, a banana or a papaw? If you maintain the natural shape, colour and taste of fruits the natural vitamins within are protected without a doubt. Therefore we don?t have any suspicion and fear when eating such natural fruits.? ?
There was a loss of quality and quantity with regard to the produce
	Farmers were given instructions through development projects
	As much as up to 30-35 % of the vegetables and fruits and up to 10-15% of cereals were lost prior to the harvest
The mangoes which have a natural taste and quality are being supplied to the market. These fruits come from mango processing zones in Minuwangoda and the Gampaha District. Given the situation that fruits sold in most places are suspicious, the mangoes plucked from the gardens in these places are trustworthy.? ?
Boragodawatta in Minuwangoda is famous for the mango business. The popular system adopted so far is the method of ripening the mangoes by spraying chemicals on them. The traders in Boragodawatta encountered? various difficulties such as rotting of mangoes and fruits going waste. Much of the fruit was wasted before reaching the market. As a result the traders were known to supply fruits of low standard.? ?
There was a loss of quality and quantity with regard to the produce. There were problems associated with the production, ripening, storing, handling and harvesting the produce.? ?
As with mangoes the cultivators get a low price while consumers have to pay a huge price.
A new technology has been introduced to the mango sellers of Borogodawatta, Minuwangoda. This has been possible due to the project activities conducted during the period 2016-2018 by the Post Harvesting, Technology and Research Institute. The institute understood that millions of rupees are lost to the country due to the situation that existed. As much as up to 30-35 % of the vegetables and fruits and up to 10-15% of cereals were lost prior to the harvest.? ?
None of the previous Governments had paid any attention to these problems - Bandara
By-products and pre-harvest technology were introduced in place of the old traditional systems that were in use. Farmers were given instructions through development projects. Research was conducted post-harvest using technology. Extension Officer Nisansala Weerasuriya of the Post Harvest Technological Institute of Colombo and officials of the Ministry of Agriculture featured prominently in these sessions.? ?
Setting standards?
Plucking of mangoes was done by covering the produce with a net. This was the method used instead of plucking mangoes by employing a manual picker. Farmers were introduced to pre-harvesting technical knowledge and collection of mangoes. In the end the produce was sent to the processing centres. They were packed in plastic boxes instead of wooden boxes. Extension Officer Nisansala Weerasuriya introduced the technical system where the produce was transported up to the market from the? processing centre. This was after the fruits were labelled.?
The process involved packing and categorizing and after that the selection of ripened mangoes. This was done by setting up a standard and a system of obtaining ripe mangoes. Efforts were made to keep them in a can in the crank case. The windows were shut by adopting ?Ethylene? Gas instead of spreading chemicals to ripen the mangoes.? ?
The method of getting ripened mangoes is the most important message driven to the minds of the people working in the Muniwangoda Mango Zone. The efforts taken by the Post Harvest Technical Institute regarding this endeavor must be lauded. Traders in the Mango Zone have been educated as to how to produce Ethylene Gas. This technique when used ensures taste and quality and helps produce natural mangoes without poison.? ?
The special message given by the Post Harvest Technical Institute and Minuwangoda Mango Zone to the people in Minuwangoda is how to ripen mangoes. The Colombo Extension Officer Weerasuriya has created awareness among the businessmen in the mango zone. This is regarding the use of this technology which helps to give the taste and the quality to natural mangoes. This way the produce has no poison.? ?
There is another special message. Fresh and ripe mangoes can be obtained when the plastic can is taken with fruits after keeping them for 24 hours in the crank case. The door has to be shut properly.?
Afterwards the mangoes are selected according to standard, labeling (Minuwangoda Mangos) and then packed in cardboard boxes and loaded onto vehicles and transported to the market.? ?
Rs. 6 million have been invested on introducing the technique of post harvest. This has been done by the Technical Institute for Post Harvest of the Ministry of Agriculture.? The project has benefited self-employed Mango Traders in Minuwangoda. This project was done under the theme ?Developing the village? by the present Government.? ?
Therefore 11 out of 30 members of the community producing mangoes were given 11 crank cases. This is used in the ripening of mangoes using sanitary facilities. In addition to this, stickers have been named as Minuwangoda Mangoes. As many as 150 cardboard boxes for packing, two nets for plucking along with 80 baskets have been given to each person.? Two nets and 30 plastic baskets were given to the other 19 members of the society.? ?
Extension Officer Weerasuriya of the Colombo Post Harvest Technology Institute expressed her views about the Mango Processing Zone at? Minuwangoda.? ?
?Our institute has a number of objectives. Improved technology in connection with storing and planning of agricultural products were introduced. Better packing and an efficient system of transporting goods were also introduced. These steps helped increase the income of the farmers. Losses were minimized through technical promotion activities? which were put to use during post harvest. Modern and efficient tools were used in the production process.

They all shy away from passive smoking!
	
?
A former deputy was languishing at home following his defeat at the polls when he was offered the chair of a state undertaking involved in trade.
?
This worthy is said to be a chain smoker who has failed to give up the habit despite it being offensive to those with whom he must deal with during the working hours.?
Directors as well as all top executives of this establishment fight shy of entering the air-conditioned office of this person when he is at his desk, because it is always filled with tobacco smoke. This has resulted in a communication gap between the management and the top executives to the detriment of the efficient running of this establishment, they say.?
The situation at this establishment has been brought to the notice of the political authority responsible for overseeing it, but he had not acted so far either to remove the fag-puffing head or advise him not to smoke while on duty if he cannot kick the habit.

?
The latest news that there is a move to bring the village level organizations like Death Donation Societies under the VAT regime has raised the hackles of the Green party backbenchers, they say.
?
Sparks flew at the recent Green party?s Diyawanna group meeting when this issue was brought up by the irate backbenchers.
These members had told the party leadership that they would surely face a hostile reception in the villages if the minor organizations at the village level were forced to pay the tax.
At this stage, the party leadership had promised to have the issue explained to them by the purohita concerned himself. However, the members had said in unison: ?We are not interested in any explanation why the tax should be imposed. Our stand is there should be no levying of such a tax on the village level organizations!?

Traffic fine increase, will increase Govt. revenue
	
Private Bus Operators and taxi operators today voiced their displeasure over the fuel price hike that came into effect midnight and the new increased fines for traffic offences.
The All Ceylon Private Bus Association (ACPBA) said it had decided to hoist black flags on buses to express its opposition to the recent fuel price hike and implementation of new traffic fines from Sunday (15)
It said that the hoisting of black flags on buses would be done countrywide on the date of implementing the traffic fines.
?The initial resistance will be done with hoisting black flags on buses. Later several actions will be taken. It may end with a countrywide bus strike,? Mr Priyanjith said.
?By hoisting black flags, we urge the Government to roll back on the fuel price and traffic fines,? he said.
Meanwhile, Lanka Private Bus Owners Association (LPBOA) President Gemunu Wijeratne said, b by increasing traffic fines for 33 offences the Government was attempting to increase its revenue.
?During the previous discussions with Ministers, we had agreed on increasing fine of Rs.25,000 for seven traffic offenses. But the Government had given a totally different result,? he said.
?During the discussions I have urged Ministers that our association agreed to the proposed seven traffic offences, due to increase of road accidents and due to increasing of number of deaths,? he said.
?By increasing traffic fines for 33 offences, the Government cannot reduce road accidents but would be able to increase Government revenue,? Mr Wijeratne said.
?Before implementing new fines and regulations the road infrastructure should be developed such as road capacity and proper bus halts.
?We have requested a meeting with the Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera and Finance State Minister Eran Wickramaratne this evening to discuss the fuel pricing formula.
?The formula should be transparent, when calculating the fuel price and it should be exhibited to the general public,? he said.
He said that a bus fare policy should also be implemented and it should be taken under the Finance Ministry.
Meanwhile, All Island Three Wheel Taxi Driver Association?s Lalith Dharmasekara said pointed out that the increase of fines for traffic offences had been increased by 150 percent.
?The minimum traffic fine would be Rs.1,000,? he said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Update: US aircraft locates missing Lankan fishermen
	
A US Navy P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft has located the missing Sri Lankan fishing vessel yesterday after joining search efforts at the request of the Sri Lankan Navy, the US Embassy said today.
The vessel was located by an aircraft from the ?Pelicans? of Patrol Squadron (VP) 45 assigned to US 7th Fleet and flew out of Naval Support Facility Diego Garcia.
Commander Mark E. Zematis, Commander Patrol Squadron 45, said, ?As we continue to explore the operational reach and agility of the P-8A Poseidon, the trust and relationships we build with our multi-national partners becomes more apparent in such a complex and broad Indo-Pacific region,"
He said the positive relationship between Sri Lanka and the US allowed the aircrew and maintenance team to effectively launch and assist with the recovery of the missing fishermen.
The 40-foot vessel and crew of six went missing on July 8 near Dondra Head. A Sri Lankan Navy ship is headed to the location provided by the P-8A along with a commercial vessel nearby to render assistance.
The P-8A is the world?s newest, most capable maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft and operates regularly throughout the Indo-Pacific in support of regional security and stability.
Seventh Fleet's area of operation encompasses 36 maritime countries and 50 percent of the world?s population with between 50 to 70 US ships and submarines, 140 aircraft and approximately 20,000 Sailors in the 7th Fleet.

## Title: What the  German Ambassador said?
## Section: Opinion

What the  German Ambassador said?
	
The Controversy created over the alleged violation of tender procedures with regard to the LNG Plant, to be installed at Kerawalapitiya, is just the tip of the Iceberg; corruption, bribery, malpractices and kickbacks have become almost an integral part of State initiated mega development deals and projects of this nature.
The deviation from the accepted procedure, in the LNG plant case was such, that Jorn Rohde, the German Ambassador himself, had to make his voice heard putting pressure on the government to get the deal done according to the?standard procedure.
The concern shown by the German Ambassador is largely due to the fact that the local entity Lakdhanavi, the lowest bidder at the tender, were to engage German technology in accomplishing the task and also in the process of obtaining German assistance in the form of a Loan to fund the execution of it.
The pretext under which the tender was to be awarded to a Chinese company, which fell short in terms of the lowest cost vis-a-vis the Lakdhanavi Bid, was that the cost of a unit proposed by Lakdhanavi was without taking account of the VAT and other taxes levied in importing the machinery needed.?
Yet, experts see it as a simple matter of amending the figures with such tax calculations, which, even then put Lakdhanavi as the most viable option.
Tentacles of the corrupt
The labyrinthine nature of corruption in this country (As anywhere else in the world) is highly complicated and shady. It touches politicians, top officials, professionals, Multi-National Companies and sometimes even foreign Sovereign States.
The tentacles of these forces who violate, circumvent and manipulate standard tender procedures reach very high levels making it very difficult to detect and extremely dangerous to bust.?
Although our legal system is quick to pounce on corruption at the lowest levels such as the office peon taking a 500 rupee santhosam or the Police officer taking a gratification in the thousands, it seems paralyzed and even non-existent when it comes to shady deals amounting to billions of dollars and involving big shots, as the common man would put it.
The Highways, Ports, Airports and any project of substantial worth are covered in a misty shade of opaqueness that seems impenetrable.
The Hambantota Port, the Southern and Colombo Expressways, the Central Expressway are some of the more prominent instances of corruption at gigantic levels.
All allegations against the former rulers disappear to oblivion as there seems to be a tacit understanding that ?it is our turn now? by those ruling the roost now.
When projects of national importance are afflicted with corruption, it is the national economy, before anything, that suffers. It would not be an exaggeration to say that the national wealth thus lost outweighs the prospective benefits that would bear fruit in the long run.
Exposing shady deals
Unlike the yesteryears, there are groups who are interested in these deals and who make public inquiries regarding these suspicious workings at the top.
The Right to Information Act is a very potent tool used by these vigilantes to bring to light these vampire-like figures who suck the lifeblood of the nation. The sil redi case is a good lesson for the public officials to exercise caution and to have some backbone in resisting the urgings of the political strong men to skip and deviate from the rule book.
Yet, it is quizzical as to how it is only the trigger men but not those who scheme these daylight robberies of public wealth, are taken to task and punished, albeit very rarely.
Despite the non- stop and now stale, mantra of attracting Foreign Direct Investment, there is little improvement in terms of actual investment.
One reason undoubtedly is the lack of transparency that foreign investors eagerly expect in investing in foreign countries. If not for the Chinese investments the former regime made use of freely and which this Government too seems to be wooing despite accusing the Rajapaksas of underhand deals with China, do we have anything substantial in terms of FDI s? I doubt it very much.
Especially, when it comes to manufacturing and the industrial sector, where we are in dire need of funding and expertise, the picture is bleak.
Over-reliance on the service sector, without much in terms of agricultural and industrial production has its own hazards
Highly polarizing political stances by respective Governments have alienated us from our friends such as Germany and Japan, who in the past have contributed with their investments, funding and loans at very concessionary rates to major undertakings at the national level.
What makes it convenient for the rulers to obtain funding from China et al is that they do not expect any kind of criteria to be fulfilled by the recipient countries in obtaining loans. Especially in terms of those nations that are not in the good books with the US and the West, they would eagerly grant funding, ultimately creating a web of indebtedness around those States which give the Chinese more leeway and influence over political and military matters of those?
hapless States.
Needless to say, the US too, is past masters of making weaker foreign sovereigns victims of their debt-trap.
Investment for the manufacturing industry
When one sees the sky risers coming up in the Colombo city, it might seem that we are rapidly developing; in a sense we are. But little in terms of manufacture or industry oriented workplaces where we badly need substance.
Over-reliance on the service sector, without much in terms of agricultural and industrial production has its own hazards.
In a global context closed and conservative national interest becoming the moving force in developed countries, there is a risk in waiting for our foodstuffs and other necessities to come from the sea.
The threat of transnational terrorism poses to international trade, air and sea routes, logistics etc. questions the wisdom of relying entirely on the service sector sans backing of sound agricultural and industrial cushioning economically.
We need to attract foreign investment and good investors at that; not those marauders who come with the mind to rob us and then flee with the plunder; nor should we lean heavily against superpowers who lend freely until we are in their debt traps up to our necks. The most viable method of ensuring such investment is by ensuring transparency, accountability and ensuring a level playing field for the would-be investors. Adhering to standard and accepted Tender procedure is in the forefront of encouraging good foreign investors. Debacles of the LNG plant type certainly do not encourage such investors; on the contrary, they act as shriek alarms of a deterrent to them.
Germany has recently opened a trade office in Sri Lanka with a view to facilitate German investment in Sri Lanka.
Yet, the word of the German Ambassador, questioning the openness and fairness of procedures adopted in tenders does not encourage any investor of credible repute.
That is the pith and substance of the concerns voiced by the German Ambassador.??

Withdraw plans to implement death penalty: Amnesty International
	
Sri Lanka must pull back from any plans to implement the death penalty and preserve its longstanding positive record on shunning this cruel and irreversible punishment, Amnesty International said today.
It said President Maithripala Srisena was reportedly pressing ahead with plans to execute 19 death row prisoners convicted of drug-related offences.
?By resuming executions after more than 40 years, Sri Lanka will do immense damage to its reputation. The government must immediately halt plans to carry out any executions, commute all death sentences, and establish an official moratorium on the implementation of the death penalty as a first step towards its full abolition,? Amnesty International South Asian Deputy Director Dinushika Dissanayake said.
?Sri Lanka has been a leader in the region, with an enviable record of shunning this cruel and irreversible punishment at a time when many other countries persisted with it. Now, when most of the world has turned its back on the death penalty, it risks heading in the wrong direction and joining a shrinking minority of states that persist with this horrific practice.?
?Amnesty International is absolutely opposed to the death penalty in all circumstances, regardless of the crime or the method of execution.?
?Executing people for drug-related crimes is a violation of international law ? which says the death penalty can only be imposed in countries that are yet to abolish it for the ?most serious crimes?,
meaning intentional killing? and would brazenly defy Sri Lanka's international commitments, including its repeated votes in favour of a moratorium on the implementation of the death penalty at the UN General Assembly, including most recently in 2016.?
?Sri Lanka carried out its last execution in 1976.There is no evidence that the death penalty has a unique deterrent effect against crime. Executions are never the solution and, for drug-related offences, constitute a violation of international law. Sri Lanka should choose a more humane and just path,? Mr. Dissanayake said.
As of today, 142 countries have abolished the death penalty in law or practice. In the Asia-Pacific region, 19 countries have abolished the death penalty for all crimes and a further seven are abolitionist in practice.
In 2017, as recorded by Amnesty International, executions were carried out in an isolated minority of countries (23), and only 11 of these ? or 6% of the world's total ?carried out executions every year in the past five years.
