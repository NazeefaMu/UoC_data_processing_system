Charges of HR violations must be addressed: CBK
	
Accusations of human rights violations during the conflict in Sri Lanka must be addressed, ex-president and current Chairperson of the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga had said on Wednesday.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly under the theme ?Leading by Example ? Innovative Partnerships and Responses?, Ms. Kumaratunga said the country did not win peace because the Government did not undertake a peace building process. ?
?After a change of Government, however, the two major political parties were brought together through a common vision.? This makes things very easy. Military means are not sufficient to end a conflict. For those reasons, a reconciliation mechanism had been set up working very closely with United Nations agencies,? she said. ?
According to a release published on the UN website, she had said creative programmes had been instituted to change attitudes and equal rights had been accorded to minorities and for that purpose a new Constitution was being drafted with the participation of the former opposition. ?
?In schools, children of the four major communities were being brought together for the first time in their lives.? Young professionals were being brought together in workshops and through arts festivals. Psycho-social support was being provided for those traumatized during the conflict.? In districts damaged by conflict, including those dominated by minorities, five-year development plans were being implemented.? In addition to United Nations agencies, bilateral partnerships were being developed to support these programmes,? she said.

CIMA sponsors creation of world?s first management accounting standard
	
CIMA has sponsored the creation of the world?s first management accounting standard, codifying a universal framework for best practice in decision-making.
PAS 1919:2016 Guide to management accounting principles has been published this week by the British Standards Institute, with input from organisations including Sky, The Environment Agency, Fujitsu, the NHS and Siemens. It is designed as a best-practice guide to management accounting, allowing organisations to benchmark their finance function and to unlock the full contribution that management accountancy can make.?
CIMA Executive Director External Affairs Tony Manwaring said, ?In today?s fast-paced and challenging climate it is critical that organisations across all sectors, geographies and of all sizes can take the right decisions to drive success in the short, medium and long term. PAS 1919 provides a best-in-class framework to enable leaders across the private and public and third sectors to achieve this.?
The specification was based on the Global Management Accounting Principles, created in 2014 by CIMA and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. CIMA is currently piloting a self-assessment diagnostic tool based on the principles. The PAS, which will be launched later this year, will provide a practical resource to diagnose the effectiveness of management accounting within organisations both large and small. ?
Manwaring said, ?As management accountancy moves towards its second century, our principles provide the framework that ensures information in organisations is influential, relevant and underpins analysis on a basis of trust across the business in a way that enables organisations across the world to create and preserve value.?

Container of dried chillies worth Rs.10 m seized by Customs
	
Three containers with dried chillies, valued at about Rs.10 million, imported from China, had been seized at the Orugodawatte Container yard this evening, Deputy Customs Director Parakrama Basnayake said.
He said upon inspection it was revealed that the three containers had been stocked with 63,500kgs of dried chillies which were not fit for human consumption.
The containers had been examined at the Customs Revenue Task Force Division at the Rank Container Terminal (RCT) in Orugodawatta.
Investigations revealed the dried chillies had been imported by a leading company dealing with food imports located on the Fifth Cross Street in Pettah.
The containers, which had arrived in Colombo seven weeks ago from China, had been kept at the RCT for 21 days, and were thought to have been outdated even before being shipped. The consignment did not even have a Quality Assurance certificate from the Food and Beverage Industry of Sri Lanka,? Mr. Basnayake said.
During the customs investigations it had been revealed that this business had been going on for a long period of time. ?The goods are to be confiscated and later we will decide on how best to destroy the chilies without harming the environment,? he said.
The investigations were carried out by Customs Director K.D.R. Christy, Deputy Customs Director P.J.B Basnayake, Customs Superintendent H.D. Dayananda, Assistant Preventive Officers S.V. Kamburugamuwa and A.K.K Thushara. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Debris 'almost certainly' from flight MH370: Officials
	
Two pieces of aircraft debris found on beaches in Mauritius and South Africa almost certainly came from Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, say Malaysian and Australian officials.
It is the latest development in efforts to solve the mystery of the aircraft, which went missing in March 2014.
The plane, flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, had 239 people on board when it vanished.
It is presumed to have crashed into the sea after veering off course.
Three ships are searching a 120,000 sq km area of the southern Indian Ocean but have so far found no trace of the plane.
Five pieces of debris have been confirmed as definitely or probably from the plane.
Each was found thousands of miles from the search zone, though within the area models of ocean currents have indicated debris could wash up.
All the debris is being examined in Australia by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) and other experts.
They use manufacturing marks on the pieces as well as samples of marine ecology like barnacles to help confirm whether they are likely to have come from the missing Boeing 777.
Speaking on Thursday, Malaysia's Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai said the team had "confirmed that both pieces of debris from South Africa and Rodrigues Island are almost certainly from MH370".
The ATSB also said both sections were "almost certainly" from 9M-MRO, which is the plane's registration.
No other 777 has ever crashed in the southern hemisphere, and none has reported missing pieces.
The ocean search, involving Australia, Malaysia and China, has scored more than 105,000 sq km of seafloor so far, much of it areas which have never been explored before.
But the countries have agreed that in the absence of "credible new information" the search will end by the middle of the year. (BBC)
1. A section of wing called a flaperon, found on Reunion Island in July 2015 - confirmed as debris in September 2015
2. Horizontal stabilizer from tail section, found in Mozambique in December 2015
3. Stabilizer panel with "No Step" stencil, found in Mozambique in February 2016
4. Engine cowling bearing Rolls-Royce logo, found in March 2016 in Mossel Bay, South Africa.

ICC withdraws doping case, apologizes to Kusal
	
Cricket?s world body on Wednesday withdrew a doping case against cricketer Kusal Janith Perera after his lawyers proved scientifically and beyond reasonable doubt that the testing process of the WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) accredited lab report in Qatar was flawed.
Soon after withdrawing the provisional suspension issued the ICC released a statement apologizing to the cricketer and said it would call for an urgent explanation from the World Anti-Doping Agency and the Qatar laboratory which tested Perera?s urine sample.
?We regret what Mr. Perera has had to endure,? David Richardson, ICC Chief Executive said in the statement. ?Whilst I am confident that this is an isolated incident in respect of tests commissioned by the ICC, we are seeking an urgent explanation from WADA and the laboratory in an attempt to understand what has transpired and what will be done to ensure it does not happen again.?
ICC confirmed that Perera had not used any performance-enhancing substances.
?We wish to make it clear that there is no evidence that Mr. Perera has ever used performance-enhancing substances and we wish him well in his future cricketing endeavours.?
ICC?s withdrawal comes after the Qatari laboratory changed their earlier stance on adverse analytical finding to atypical finding after an independent panel of experts appointed by the ICC decided that ?an adverse analytical finding by the laboratory was not sustainable, because, for various scientific and technical reasons, it could not be ruled out that the 19-Norandrostenedione was produced naturally in the player's body and/or formed in the samples after the player provided them.?
?These concerns were immediately presented by the ICC to the Qatar laboratory, which has today confirmed that it has withdrawn the Adverse Analytical Finding and is instead reporting an Atypical Finding. It has advised that no specific further investigation of the player's two samples is warranted, but has recommended the monitoring of the player's steroid profile moving forward,? the ICC statement added.
Perera, 25, was suspended on December 7 after he returned an adverse analytic finding in a urine sample taken during the West Indies tour of Sri Lanka in December and the B sample testing done later in the month confirmed the A sample testing.
?.... the ICC has worked with Mr Perera?s lawyers as they have attempted to identify the source of the 19-Norandrostenedione found in the samples. As part of those efforts, the ICC sought further information from the Qatar laboratory and granted various extensions of time to the player?s legal team to allow it to carry out additional analysis and investigation work.
In addition, the Qatar laboratory analysed the B samples provided by Mr Perera in January 2016, and reported that that analysis confirmed the presence of the same substance in those samples.?
However, Perera maintained his innocence right through and sought Sri Lanka Cricket?s help to challenge a possible four-year ban.
?We believed in Kusal,? said SLC chief Thilanga Sumathipala. ?When he requested us to help, the board unanimously decided to support the cricketer.?
Accordingly, SLC appointed Morgan Sports Law, a UK-based law firm dealing on sports related cases who decided to challenge the case scientifically. Accordingly the player was subjected to various medical tests including polygraph test and hair drug test, two highly sophisticated tests done in England and France.
?Both these tests results were in favour of Kusal and the rest is now history,? Sumathipala said adding that over Rs. 13 million was spent on the whole process.
?We have a strong case now and we will negotiate with ICC to get at least the direct charges we incurred. But have no intention in going for any sort of confrontation with the ICC as we are part of it,? he added.
Speaking at the press conference, cricketer Kusal Perera admitted he was under lots of pressure during the six months of his suspension.
?It was a big pressure on me. But I knew I would be cleared because I had not done anything wrong. I am extremely happy now and is eager to get back to playing cricket,? Perera added.
During the six months of suspension, Perera suffered heavily both financially and with a shattered reputation but the player insists that he is not keen on going for any legal battle to claim damages.
?All I want now is to get back to playing,? he reiterated.
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera credited SLC chief and his elected committee for the commendable effort in getting the player exonerated from all charges.
?If not for an elected body, I don?t think we had any chance of getting the player cleared. They handled it smartly,? said the Minister. (Champika Fernando)

In April 2015, People?s Bank clocked a record number of 3,448,878 transactions across the country and topping all other local banks, positioning themselves No.1 on the list, for the third year consecutively.

No takers for revamping Sri Lankan Airlines: Minister
	
The Sri Lankan government has made it clear that no airline company has ?formally expressed? interest in the proposed revamping of SriLankan Airlines.
Responding to a query from The Hindu on whether Qatar Airways was being contemplated as a possible international partner, Eran Wickramaratne, Deputy Minister of the Public Enterprise Department under whose purview the airline comes, said ?there is no specific party. There are many names that keep coming up from time to time. No one has formally expressed interest.?
?Every party talks to very many different people in the government,? he added.
The restructuring of the airlines had become inevitable as the organisation had been in the red for the past eight years and its liabilities stood at $ 3.2 billion as on December 31, 2015.
Explaining how the revamp plan would be carried out, the Minister said the balance sheet of SriLankan Airlines had to be restructured first as it was ?not saleable.? For this, valuation had to be carried out by engaging one or more parties.
Disclosing that the National Savings Bank (which also comes under the Public Enterprise Department) had been chosen as the lead manager, he said an international investment bank with aviation expertise had to be selected, as ?there is no local party with airlines expertise.?
With the assistance of the investment bank, the documents for request for proposals would be issued and eventually, one party would be chosen for the proposed partnership. The Deputy Minister was confident that the process up to the selection of the party for the partnership, which he called the ?first part?, would be completed in six months.
Of the orders placed in 2014 (during the previous Rajapaksa regime) for the purchase of new aircraft (A 350-900), Mr. Wickramaratne said four aircraft were to be delivered in the immediate future. Of them, one had been ?laid off at a reasonably good price.? Negotiations were on with other airlines for the other three.
He also explained how difficult it was to cancel the orders straightaway for the aircraft, as there would be ?huge penalties.? He questioned the rationale behind the placement of the orders for wide-bodied aircraft when the airlines had been operating more regional services.

Top police officers have interfered: CID
	
CID investigations have revealed that high ranking police officers had interfered into the preliminary investigations relating to the death of former ruggerite Waseem Thajudeen, Senior State Counsel Dilan Ratnayaka told Magistrate Nishantha Pieris today.
He also said that the CID had recorded statements from 20 Police officers and their statements to the police seemed to be contradictory.
Counsel Chatura Galhena representing the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) during the magisterial inquiry said that the SLMC had appointed a disciplinary committee to inquire on the panel of JMOs headed by former Chief JMO Ananda Samarasekera who conducted the first autopsy on Thajudeen?s body and the JMOs had been summoned to appear before the Committee in June.
Counsel Ratnayaka further said the behaviour of the former Narahenpitia Crimes OIC during the recovery of Thajudeen's wallet at Kirulapone was questionable. He requested the Magistrate to further remand the OIC.
He also moved court to order the Mobitel mobile phone Company to provide details of mobile phone conversation of the deceased and the suspects to the CID.
The Counsel further asserted that the CID was examining CCTV footage on the incident with the assistance of experts in Canada and England.
The Magistrate while ordering Mobitel Company to provide details of the phone conversations to the CID ordered the SLMC to submit a report on their investigations to court.
The former Narahenpita Crimes OIC was further remanded till May 26. (T. Farook Thajudeen)

?From 2017, we will accept applications online,? he added.

Vehicle Imports: Special committee to assess value
	
An Evaluation Committee had been appointed by the Prime Minister to assess a value of an imported vehicle, the Vehicle Importers? Association of Sri Lanka (VIASL) said.
It said the Committee would consider the ?true transaction value? or the unit value or the highest, when imposing tax.
The ?true transaction value? is the actual value of the imported vehicle, while the ?Unit Value? is a value based on a formula with the vehicle engine capacity multiplied by the rupee value. The Rupee Value is declared by the Finance Ministry.
VIASL Chairman Mahinda Sarathchandra said the special committee comprising fifteen members, was appointed on Tuesday.
During the meeting, it was decided to impose tax as equal rights for both used and brand new vehicles.
The meeting was held over the request made to the Prime Minister to get a tax relief on vehicle imports, he said.
?According to the recommendation of the committee decisions, actions would be taken in the coming weeks,? he said.
At the meeting Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said that the Tax Identification Number (TIN) would be black listed, if any importer failed to declare the ?true transaction value? or involved in any malpractices when importing vehicles.
?The necessary taxes would be imposed by the Customs and the taxes will be channeled for the development of the country,? Karunanayake said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
