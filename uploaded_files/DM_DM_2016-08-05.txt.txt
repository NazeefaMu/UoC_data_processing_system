Australia all out for a record low
	
Australia have been ripped out for their lowest ever score against Sri Lanka after a dramatic morning in Galle that has all but confirmed they will relinquish their world No.1 Test ranking.
The visitors lost their last nine wickets for just 52 runs - eight of which came this morning - to be dismissed for just 106 in reply to SL's first innings of 281.
Unsurprisingly, it was spin that did the damage for the home side. Veteran left-armer Rangana Herath took 4-35 - including a hat-trick - while off-spinner Dilruwan Perera grabbed 4-29.
It's only the third time Australia have been bowled out for less than 150 in the first innings of a Test in Asia and they would need to produce an incredible comeback if they are to avoid a series defeat.
Resuming on 2-54, the tourists lost not out batsmen Usman Khawaja in consecutive deliveries to give the hosts a dream start to the day.
Khawaja (11) and Smith (5) were both bowled when they played back to a delivery that continued on with the arm, despite the skipper's pre-match warning about the dangerous straight balls from the home side's spinners.
Having removed Smith, Herath then ripped the heart out of Australia's middle order by removing Adam Voges, Peter Nevill and Mitchell Starc to become just the second Sri Lankan to take a Test hat-trick.
With the innings nearing an end, Mitchell Marsh hit out by lofting three towering sixes to at least push his team's total beyond the 100 mark.
But Marsh was the final wicket to fall for 27, caught on the boundary attempting another maximum, as the home side carried a 175-run lead into the second innings. (Cricket.com. au)

JB Vantage Money Market Fund, part of the JB Financials (Pvt.) Ltd portfolio, won Gold for best unit trust at the recently held, prestigious CFA Sri Lanka Capital Markets Awards 2016.
JB Vantage Value Equity Fund bagged the Bronze in the same category, thereby dominating the category and underscoring their leadership position in Sri Lankas fund management arena. JB Financial is a relatively low-profile yet highly respected thought leader in the countrys domestic capital market, having spearheaded governance and ethics to advance the industry in Sri Lanka. They stand pre-eminent for the rigour of their market analytics and discerning insights. Consistency, risk mitigation, liquidity management and stewardship are hallmarks of their business ethos. Sri Lanka Capital Markets Awards is a flagship event of CFA Society Sri Lanka and held annually for the past four years. The awards recognize excellence in capital market products, the professionals who manage it and the positive impact on the development of the industry, locally. The Best Unit Trust award category was introduced for the first time this year.
Thirteen funds from six unit trust managers were reviewed for judging, for the year ended March 31, 2016, with scores given for investment processes and risk adjusted returns, risk management and compliance practices, extent of fair disclosures to unit holders as well as emphasis on disclosure to unit holders and risk management and compliance practices of the firm.
We are delighted to receive this award, said an upbeat JB Financial Chief Executive Christine Dias Bandaranaike. These awards are testament to the quality of our funds and illustrate the relevance of our management philosophy  simple principles, rigorously applied and guided by prudence.

JB Vantage is one of the few unit trusts that has self regulated its fees to one of the lowest in the market, while maintaining its offering of internationally recognized practices and standards, said JB Financial Director and JB Vantage Value Equity Fund Fund Manager Murtaza Jafferjee. But I believe our greatest strength is the meeting of old-world values like prudence and stewardship, with best in class systems and resources - be it technology or human capital that delivers consistent performance in managing and creating wealth.

JO wanted to form a separate govt. with UNP: Amaraweera
	
UPFA General Secretary and Minister Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday said five senior members of the Joint Opposition requested Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to sever ties with the SLFP, offer them six ministerial portfolios, three state ministerial and two deputy ministerial posts to support the President to form a separate government.
Minister Amaraweera told reporters at his office that it was those five JO members who were closely associated with ex President Mahinda Rajapaksa to destroy the SLFP, engaged in mudslinging at President Sirisena and jeered at the party head office. 
They are determined to create rifts in the SLFP and give the local government polls victory to the UNP on a platter. They are the ones who orchestrated the defeat of President Rajapaksa and the SLFP at the 2015 elections, Minister Amaraweera said. 
He added that the SLFP leadership has come to a point where no more betrayal by them could be tolerated and strict disciplinary action would be taken against all those who betrayed the Party and insulted the party leadership and jeered at the party headquarters.
Minister Amaraweera said two crucial meetings were scheduled to be held yesterday  the SLFP parliamentary group meeting at 7.00 p.m and followed by the Central Committee meeting to review current issues facing the party and added the Pada Yathra of the JO would definitely be discussed. He said all SLFP Parliamentarians had been invited to the group meeting scheduled to be held last afternoon including closest associates of Kurunegala District Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa like Dulles Alahapperuma, Kumara Welgama, Pavithra Wanniarachchi, Mahinda Yapa Abeywardana, Mahindananda Aluthgamage despite their behaviour. 
Minister Amaraweera admitted that his efforts to bring party leader, President Maithripala Sirisena and Mahinda Rajapaksa on one stage was a flop and that would never happen. Enough is enough. Party leader President Sirisena and the Central Committee had shown much patience to their betrayal acts for more than 20 months and the issues have reached boiling point now. There will be no more excuses and the CC will take strict possible action against those who have betrayed the party. The 65th Party convention to be held on September 3 in Kurunegala will be a turning point to the party as very crucial decisions are to be taken at the main ceremony, he said.
Commenting on the opposition to the unity government led by the UNP, Minister Amaraweera said the first unity government was formed by former President Rajapaksa by wooing 19 UNP members to the SLFP after signing an agreement between the two parties in 2006. Former President Rajapaksa gave 19 important ministerial portfolios to those who crossed over from the UNP and made them to sit on the front seats in Parliament sending senior SLFP members to the back seats. It is ridiculous for them to talk against the consensual government by stooping to that kind of actions in the past, he charged. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Demands for taking back the Katchatheevu Island from Sri Lanka were among several issues raised in the Lok Sabha today, PTI reported.
Raising the issue, K N Ramachandran of the AIADMK party expressed concern over the growing incidents of harassment inflicted on Tamil Nadu fishermen by the Sri Lankan Navy.
He said as part of finding a permanent solution to the issue, India should take back the Katchatheevu Island that it had handed over to Sri Lanka in 1974.
He contended that the island, which has been vital for Indian fishermen, could be taken back given the fact that the concerned agreement had not been ratified by Parliament.

LTTE suspect in Canada fights against deportation
	
A Toronto woman ordered out of Canada for being a self-declared member of the LTTE had argued the only evidence against her is her own past claims, which she says are not credible, the National Post reported on Thursday.
It said Canadas Immigration and Refugee Board, the Minister of Public Safety and the Federal Court of Canada, however, had rejected her revision of her past in Sri Lanka during the war.
Jayasiri Puvanenthiram was first declared inadmissible to Canada in 2004 for being a member of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
She has doggedly fought to remain in Canada, fighting appeals and pleas that have allowed her an additional 12 years in this country with her husband and two children.She said her family urgently needs her in Canada.
Puvanenthiram is a caregiver to her elderly and ill parents, her youngest son who is a Canadian citizen and depends on her because of chronic medical problems. Her eldest son has learning and development issues and her husband has health problems that may require surgery.
When Puvanenthiram first arrived in Canada in 2002, however, she seemed to be in a different space.
She told border agents she had been a voluntary member of the LTTE, an outlawed terrorist group in Canada.
It was the same account she earlier gave German authorities, when she lived there from 1998 to 2002 after leaving Sri Lanka.
She originally said she started working for the student wing of the LTTE in 1992 before voluntarily joining the LTTE proper in 1993.
Puvanenthiram said she attended to injured persons until 1994, and had a year of basic training in self-defence by the LTTE. By 1995, her duties included digging bunkers, transporting injured people and assisting in hospitals.
When government forces attacked her LTTE camp she moved to another located in Kilinochchi, where she stayed for another three years. At the LTTEs Kilinochchi camp she received weapons training from 1995 to 1998 before asking permission to be excused due to poor health. Her request, she told German authorities, was denied.
When she made her new refugee claim in Canada, all of that changed.
She told the IRB she did not voluntarily join or even support the LTTE and that she was forced to assist the group and only did so under duress. She said that between 1993 and 1995, the LTTE threatened her 10 to 12 times to recruit her.
She told the IRB at her admissibility hearing that she didnt know anything about the student wing of the group; had never received weapons or self-defence training; never served in the Kilinochchi camp; and never sought permission to leave for health reasons.
Puvanenthiram argued there is no evidence against her  except her own words, which were lies. She said she fabricated the account of LTTE involvement and the German authorities did not believe her account. Even if it were true, she argued, it is not credible because it is unsupported by other information.
The IRB said her first account is the most credible one and concluded there were reasonable grounds to believe she had been a willing member of the LTTE and, as such, inadmissible to Canada.
Thus began her series of appeals and applications. Her legal fight, in fact, outlived the warthat ended in 2009.
She had an appeal bid to the Federal Court rejected; she applied for a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRAA) but it cleared her for a safe return to Sri Lanka, a decision she also unsuccessfully tried to appeal; she next lost a bid to defer her removal and appealed that decision to the Federal Court; and she sought to have all PRAAs declared void.
She then sought residence in Canada on humanitarian and compassionate grounds in 2005, which was refused in 2008. She appealed that decision to the Federal Court as well, finally seeing some success, when a judge ordered her application to be reconsidered.
She also applied for special relief from the minister of public safety. Her request was refused, the minister saying she failed to establish that her presence in Canada would not be detrimental to the national interest.
Puvanenthiram appealed that decision as well, leading to the most recent decision.
Justice Richard Bell dismissed her appeal in a decision released this month, saying the ministers decision was justified, transparent and intelligible, and was within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes.
Bell raised the likelihood this will not end her fight. Puvanenthiram may be entitled to request a new Pre-Removal Risk Assessment, and that would bring a decision that could be appealed, again, to the Federal Court.

Women and Child Affairs Minister Chandrani Bandara said yesterday the National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) would take action against the joint opposition for using an 8-year-old child in its Pada Yathrawa based on a complaint received by the NCPA.
She said August 1, the NCPA received a complaint on its hotline No: 1929 while the Child Rights Protection Foundation had also complained to the NCPA.
The complaints are being investigated. It is cruel to use a child as a pawn for political matters. It is even worse if the child was subjected to mental and physical abuse, the minister said.
She said as minister of child affairs I would not hesitate to condemn this act of cruelty to a child.
This proves that the JO is ready to even go to any length to grab power, she said.
The minister said those who embraced and hugged children failed to adopt laws to protect children and added that the government hoped to prepare a child protection policy. (Ajith Siriwardana)

The joint opposition today rejected the allegation made by UPFA General Secretary and Minister Mahinda Amaraweera that five senior members of the JO had offered Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe their support to form a separate government.
SLFP Central Committee (CC) member and MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, who is in the JO, said as far as he knew none of their MPs had met the Premier asking for portfolios or offered their support to form a government.
These are mere statements which are of no value. Some seven or eight months ago, they said five to six MPs in the JO will join the government. Did anyone join No. Similarly, now they are accusing our MPs of offering their support to the Premier to form a government, he said.
Minister Amaraweera on Thursday said five senior members of the JO, who were close to former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, had requested the Prime Minister to end ties with the SLFP, asked for ministerial portfolios and offered to support to form a separate government. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Remittance market to continue to grow with more white-collar jobs
	
Chandula Abeywickrama

By Supun DiasFirst of all, why is the International Day of Family Remittance is so important for the countrys largest savings bank
This is the first time it was proposed by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), a UN affiliated agency. The day is an invaluable opportunity not only to recognize the efforts of migrant workers globally. As a result of this, people from Asian countries go to developed countries as workers, where 250 million migrant workers remitting US $ 400 billion annually.
They go as individuals and leave their families behind for economic reasons. But its a huge sacrifice they make. The most focused area is, they think about the social and economic development of the family. After three to five years they come back. As a result of this, thousands of children are educated; thousands of houses are built and renovated; thousands of micro businesses come up.
But most of them are unable to find the same revenue here. So the focus is, there should be adequate revenue to support his/her life here. The day ensures that the family is enriched socially, culturally and economically. The day is important as it enables to strengthen the current partnerships and create new synergies among sectors to promote the development impact of remittances worldwide.

How has the global economic slowdown and the sharp drop of commodity prices affected the remittance market as a whole
There are migrant worker corridors. Eastern Europeans go to Western Europe; Asians go to Europe, Far East and Middle East. There is an economic downturn in Europe and the Middle East corridor countries will be affected. But countries like Qatar will keep improving. There is a transition from blue-collar workers to white-collar workers (skilled employees). But there are new corridors opened up for Sri Lankans in countries such as South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore and Japan. These countries will give us high-value remittances.
We will continue to have the US $ 7 billion annually but you would see these transitions taking place gradually within few years. If you look at countries like Bangladesh, there is a significant opportunity for skilled Sri Lankans. Also countries such as Myanmar, which has opened up recently, Sri Lankans have a huge demand. Remittance business would expand globally. We have to plan this out strategically as the talent move will take place. So I dont think we will be affected much since we are a small country. Though 10 percent of our population is migrant workers, its still a small fraction when you take the global migrant workforce. But the construction field will have some setbacks in the Middle East and that may affect the migrant workers there.

What sort of steps has NSB taken to face this situation as it is our largest foreign exchange earner
We are the only AAA-rated bank and we have 100 percent state guarantee. See, it will be replenished with the transition from blue-collar jobs to white-collar jobs.
Our focus is to provide them with the best services available. What we are focusing is not only the remittance side. There is lot of specialized remittance agencies. Here the person who remits money has a relationship with the bank and we ensure that his family benefits from a wide range of financial services provided by us.

Can you share with us some of the initiatives taken by NSB to capture the remittance market We have heard that still there are lot of people who send remits through illegal channels. 
We have recognized the importance of this segment and we are a national bank so we have national priorities. We have to look after particularly the rural people. One third of the population is taken care of by the migrant workers. We feel as a bank that it is our responsibility to be there for Sri Lankans to provide the service. Though we are a savings bank, we want to bring in financial services by strengthening our correspondence network and delivery mechanisms in Europe, South Korea and the Middle East. We have now branded our service as NSB  U TRUST.
People trust NSB. Still for rural people it is the bank they can trust and be dependent upon. We have 250 branches and as we have linked with the Postal Department, with an additional 650 post offices, we have been able to create the largest network with the greatest accessibility for migrant workers and their dependents. We have made other financial services available for them as well in the meantime.

How can we use foreign remittance towards the countrys development process
Remittance flows have a substantial positive impact and contribute significantly to several key development priorities through new partnerships, improved public policies and scaled-up innovations. To a greater extend, our economy is powered by this sector. However, they are not represented by a migrant worker association. So they dont have a lobbying body to have greater facilities for these people. Economic development with their contribution has to come from micro level.
Other than a savings account or a fixed deposit, there is no other platform for the migrant worker to invest. Every migrant worker wont have the entrepreneurial skills, but he would want to invest. There has to be some sort of guidance towards providing them with investment opportunities in areas such as agriculture, tourism, hospitality and healthcare.

Under your leadership what are the new steps that has been taken to increase the number of customers in this market and how do you plan to expand
Our plan is to ensure that there is a next generation of customers, the younger generation. They need to be a crucial part of this sector. But they would want our services mostly on a digital platform. Customer expansion has to go in two ways. One is the barefoot level banking and the other is banking for the next generation, the tech-savvy generation. Barefoot banking needs more link points and we do not want to go 100 percent on tech. We still have only about five million smartphones, the rest are yet to be linked digitally for such services/platforms. So we have to cater to them as well and to have a more pragmatic approach as we want to build and have relationships that would ensure that the people are enriched economically as saving is the initiative of the asset creation.

Finally, how optimistic are you about the remittance market in Sri Lanka
It would continue to grow significantly. We are a skilled and a very talented country. Therefore, migration will continue to take place. More white-collar opportunities will come to Sri Lanka mainly from new fronts such as South Korea, Japan and Israel. Sri Lankans would stand ahead of others to earn jobs with respect in IT, healthcare, hospitality and the fashion industry. There will be a decline in opportunities in Saudi Arabia but like I told you earlier more opportunities will continue to flow from the East.

Rupee ends firmer on bond buying by foreign investors
	
REUTERS: The Sri Lankan rupee ended firmer yesteday as foreign investors sold dollars to buy local bonds on hopes of higher returns after the Central Banks policy rate hike, dealers said.
The spot rupee, which was last actively traded on June 13, resumed trading on Thursday. It traded at 145.60/68 per dollar, compared with Wednesdays indicative price of 145.80/90, a dealer said.
There was a lot of foreign buying in local bonds. The spot currency is being actively traded today, said a currency dealer, asking not to be named.
Foreign investors have been buying bonds since the IMF (International Monetary Fund) loan was approved and we see some sudden increase after the appointment of the new Central Bank Governor and last weeks policy rate hike.
Dealers also said foreign investors were also converting dollars to buy equities.
The spot rupee is usually managed tightly by the Central Bank, and market participants use the forward market levels for guidance on the currency.
One-week rupee forwards ended at 145.80/88 per dollar, up from Wednesdays close of 146.00/15.
The Central Bank last week raised its main interest rates by 50 basis points each in a surprise move aimed at curbing stubbornly high credit growth that is adding to concerns about inflationary pressures.
Foreign investors have bought 64.5 billion rupees (US $443.30 million) worth of government securities, since the IMF agreed to a US $1.5-billion bailout package, from April 29 through July 27, Central Bank data showed.

SLFP CC decides on stern action against errant MPs
	
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Central Committee (CC), which met after some of its MPs conducted the paada yathra, decided to expel all those who had acted in contravention of the party's rules and regulations, it is learnt.
Party stalwart, Minister Mahinda Amaraweera told Daily Mirror, after the meeting, that the disciplinary committee of the party had been asked to identify those who had criticised the party and its leadership during the paada yathra and expel them forthwith.
The party decided yesterday to institute disciplinary action immediately against Puttalam District MP Sanath Nisantha on the basis that there was sufficient evidence to prove that he had criticised President Maithripala Sirisena's leadership.
The SLFP CC had also decided to institute action against its former local government members who had torn up letters sent by the party during a media briefing, in defiance of the request by the party secretary to apply for nominations at the next election.
Minister Chandima Weerakkody said MP Nisantha had openly said he would not accept the party leadership.
"The party decided to check on whether others had olso breached party discipline," he said.
Asked whether action would be taken against former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, he said no names had been mentioned apart from that of Mr. Nisantha.
He said both President Sirisena and former president Chandrika Kumaratunga had stressed the need to maintain discipline in the party.
The Central Committee had also discussed the logistics of the next Convention of the party.
The Central Committee approved the decision to continue the national unity government for five years. (Kelum Bandara)

Sri Lankan in Australia rejected for job because of brown-skin
	
A Sydney advertising agency has been forced to apologise after a job applicant who is a Sri Lankan Australian, claimed she was told that she was 'too brown' to be hired, Daily Mail Australia reported on Friday. 
Surungi Emily Hohol said she was 'livid' at the 'injustice of racism' following a job interview with creative advertising company Banjo.
'I had an interview at a creative ad agency in Sydney and was told that due to being brown and Indian (though I'm Sri Lankan) and have lived in Australia for 27 years, I wouldn't be suitable for the role as they already had two other Indian people,' she posted on Facebook.
Ms. Hohol said she was told the agency's clients 'might be alarmed by having three brown skinned people attend a meeting'.
However, Banjo had released a statement apologising and said the comments were 'taken out of context'.
'In the course of expanding the account management team at Banjo, an unfortunate misunderstanding has occurred during an interview with a candidate, for which Banjo would like to offer an unreserved apology,' Banjo CEO Andrew Varasdi said in the statement.
'The senior staff member who conducted what was a very positive interview, made a casual remark at the end of the interview, which was intended to set the person at ease.
'Unfortunately it was taken out of context and has since gained some notoriety on social media. Needless to say, the Banjo staff member is deeply upset by the incident.
