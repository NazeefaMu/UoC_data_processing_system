Warned to mend his ways if he is to keep his job
	

The head of a department responsible for law enforcement and public security received summons from a very high authority of the Diyawanna council recently.

This department head won the much coveted position following a big tussle which saw him stealing a march over a senior colleague. Reports relating to his conduct and performance which reached certain council members who backed his appointment were not complimentary to him.
There were even editorial comments in national dailies and weeklies critical of his conduct. The Diyawanna authority who once extended his patronage to this department head is said to have filed a record the cuttings of those editorial comments, they say.
The Diyawanna high authority who summoned the controversial department head gave him a severe warning that he was likely to get his walking papers soon if he failed to mend his ways, they say

17-year-old should be made Presidents IT Head: JO
	
The joint opposition today requested President Maithripala Sirisena to make the 17-year-old student, who was arrested in Kadugannawa on chargers of hacking into the Presidents official website, his Information Technology Director.
JO Member MP Udaya Gammanpila said the student should be disciplined and then awarded a scholarship.
Other countries use computer geniuses such as this in their programmes to prevent cyber threats. The boy has clearly proved that the Presidents website was not properly protected. He had simply displayed a message requesting the President to reconsider a decision that was being considered to bring forward the date when the A/L exams would be held, and by doing this he proved that the website used by the President was open to cyber attacks, he told a news conference.
The MP said the arrested student had not committed serious crimes such as data theft or distortion and that he had only committed the crime of intrusion of privacy. This is not a major criminal act for him to be treated like a terrorist. He should be disciplined and taught some manners, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

CA Sri Lanka launches Continuing Professional Development online tool
	
In its efforts to stay ahead with technological advancements and provide its stakeholders with a range of updated services for their convenience and further development, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) recently launched the Continuing Professional Development (CPD) online tool for the benefit of its members.
The CPD online tool allows the members to plan their CPD activities, keep track of their CPD progress and upload their individual CPD activities online. 
CPD is a mandatory requirement for chartered accountants, which helps enhance their professional competency and also help them remain relevant with changes at a local and international level.
Speaking during the launch, CA Sri Lanka President Lasantha Wickremasinghe said that one of the most unique features of a chartered accountant is the constant need to remain relevant.
This is why we take every effort to update the CPD services we offer our members, to ensure they are in line with their global counterparts at all times, he said. Wickremasinghe noted that the CPD online tool was an important initiative as it will help members keep up with their CPD activities and monitor their CPD hours at all times at the simple click of a button.
CA Sri Lanka CPD Committee Chairman Heshana Kuruppu said that CPD is a structured approach to lifelong learning and is helpful in developing professional competences required to perform the roles of chartered accountants effectively.
Therefore, it is the responsibility of each CA Sri Lanka member to develop and maintain professional competency by undertaking relevant CPD activities, he said. He also noted that in order to facilitate enhanced services for the members, the institute has also taken steps to carry out a learning need analysis survey to understand the CPD requirement of the members.
Based on the outcome of this analysis, we will come up with the relevant, common CPD programmes to meet the needs of our members to ensure they remain relevant with current developments and changes, he said.

Fitch affirms SLIC at IFS B+/Negative
	
Fitch Ratings has affirmed Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Limiteds (SLIC) insurer financial strength (IFS) rating at B+ with a negative outlook. The agency has also affirmed the national IFS rating and national long-term rating at AA(lka) with a stable outlook.
SLICs IFS rating is capped by Sri Lankas long-term localcurrency issuer default rating (IDR) and the negative outlook reflects Fitchs negative outlook on Sri Lankas IDR. Fitch downgraded SLICs IFS rating on March 2, 2016, following the downgrade of Sri Lankas longterm localcurrency IDR to B+ from BB and the assignment of a
negative outlook.
SLICs ratings reflect its established franchise and market position in Sri Lanka, 99.9 percent state ownership and importance to the government as the largest stateowned insurer. Offsetting these strengths are significant investments in noncore subsidiaries and a high equity exposure, which weighs on its risk-based capital. SLICs total gross written premium (GWP) increased by 14 percent in 1H16, following a 19 percent increase in 2015. The nonlife businesss combined ratio deteriorated to 108 percent (2015: 94 percent) due to higher claims stemming from a severe tropical storm in May 2016 that caused flooding and landslides in several parts of the country. Gross claims rose 63 percent to Rs.5.5 billion (1H15: Rs.3.4 billion), but net claims rose by only 32 percent due to recoveries from reinsurance.
SLIC has the highest market share in the nonlife business (20 percent in 2015) and the second highest share in life (19 percent in 2015) as measured by GWP. The companys asset base of Rs.167 billion at end2015 accounted for 36 percent of the insurance sectors assets. The company is currently operating as a composite business and is awaiting a government decision on separating its life and nonlife businesses. SLICs dividend payout increased to 58 percent in 2015 due to higher dividend expectations from the government. Profits before tax in the life segment declined to Rs.1.8 billion in 2015, from Rs.2.5 billion in 2014, as the investment income fell due to low interest rates and poor equity returns. Fitch expects rising interest rates to improve the investment income
in 2016.
SLIC has significant investments in noncore subsidiaries, made in line with government policy, which are negative for its rating. However, the government plans to dispose of some of these noncore investments. Asset and liability mismatches also expose the company to high interest rate risk from its life business, due to limited market availability of longterm investments.
SLICs regulatory riskbased capital ratio for life was 419 percent at endMarch 2016 and 200 percent for nonlife. These ratios exceed the regulatory required minimum of 120 percent for each business and compare well against peers. Fitch expects SLIC to maintain these ratios above 200 percent in the medium to long term.

Green leader says no to unjust request
	

A request was made to the second in command in yahapalanaya at the Green partys Diyawanna group meeting the other day to transfer out the Matale District Secretary forthwith.

The request came from a member of the Aluvihare clan who charged that the white-collar high-up was an errand girl of the Rajapaksas.
The party leader who was in the chair explained that the District Secretaries could not be moved about as they pleased and they had to observe the proper procedure adding that the member should speak to the Minister concerned to have his problem sorted out. The member who was not satisfied with this response insisted that the District Secretary be sent out of Matale without further delay.
Unhappy that his request had gone unheeded, the member as he sat down said it appeared that he had no other alternative but to seek a solution to his problem from a Rajapaksa.
Reacting to the members barb, the party leader said it was well known as to who was maintaining a rapport with the Rajapaksas and who was visiting whom in the recent past. The party leader also had rebuked the member for his irresponsible conduct.

A large number of purohitas and Diyawanna members attended the yahapalanaya anniversary celebration held in Matara recently.

One of the purohitas who once had close ties to the defence establishment felt the need to go to the toilet while the public function was underway. He was walking towards a public convenience at the Jayasuriya grounds when he suddenly remembered a familiar toilet at the nearby army camp.
The purohita who walked up to the toilet found to his chagrin that it was closed. His annoyance turned into a fury when he later found the toilet in a filthy state.
After relieving himself with much distaste, the purohita reprimanded the authorities at the camp for turning a blind eye to the horrid state of the toilet.
I propose to come this way soon. Let things be in a better shape by then, was his parting shot.

The hero of this story is a politico who once chaired a local body in a city suburb.

He acquired much political clout when he was appointed an electoral organizer and a central committee member of his political party in the recent past.
The politico lost his chair in the local body as well as all perks and privileges attached to it when the local bodies were dissolved by a gazette proclamation.
However, this worthy does not seem to know that he is no longer the chair of the local body and he is not entitled to perks and privileges he enjoyed by virtue of the office he held. He has not handed over his official vehicle to the authorities concerned either.
Reports say that the politico regularly attends his former office at the local body as usual and often his wife accompanies him to the local body to carry out duties assigned by her husband.
Employees of the council are compelled to carry out certain chores of the politicos household as well. The employees are meekly following the orders given by the husband-wife team fearing possible repercussions, they say.
However, people living in the area openly wonder whether the politico is going to be a permanent unwelcome feature in the area.

A political authority responsible for a state undertaking tasked with facilitating public mobility is set to wrap up a mega transaction at the cost of several billions of rupees to the government coffers.

This state undertaking now being run at a huge loss depends on Treasury funds even to meet its EPF and ETF commitments, they say.
The political authority is dead set on purchasing at least 500 buses from a company in a neighbouring country at one go regardless of the huge cost involved. However, the team at the top table in yahapalanaya had already taken a decision to purchase the vehicles required to strengthen the existing fleet in instalments from two companies.
Disdaining the decision taken by the top team, the high-up is now poised to place the seal on the deal come hell or high water. And he had declared that he would quit his job if he were compelled to call off the deal. This senior political authority had earlier vowed that he would not run for a seat in the Diyawanna council in future.

The widening of the road could have being done without harming the memorial. If they do not reconstruct it I will take action to prosecute them," Mr. Rajapaksa said."It is clear now that this is a move to satisfy the wishes of TNA MP Shashikala."

7th NAFLIA Congress attracts over 1000 participants
	
Over one thousand life insurance sales professionals gathered at the BMICH recently for the seventh annual National Forum for Life Insurance Advisers (NAFLIA). Organised by the Marketing and Sales Forum of the Insurance Association of Sri Lanka (IASL), the theme of the congress was A Day All Sri Lankans Are Insured.
Following a colourful opening ceremony and impressive curtain raiser, IASL President and Union Assurance Director/CEO Dirk Pereira addressed the gathering. In his speech Pereira highlighted the importance of ambitious thinking.
We need to think bigger and we need to be more ambitious. We are going to cover every Sri Lankan. Our ambition cannot stop at 33 percent of the working population and 12.5 percent of the overall population. These numbers must change very quickly and I think that events such as this show the capability of the insurance industry, Pereira
stated confidently.
First guest speaker MDRT, USA Zonal Chair Ravi Kumar stepped up to the mike with a happy greeting to the audience. Insurance can leave a legacy for you, your family and your clients family. This is the business of kind hearts, good thoughts and selfless service in which money is but a by-product, he said. He went on to explain the key factors and necessities in the lives of a life insurance sales professional and his/her relationship with customers. There is nothing more important than the customer seated before you, stated Kumar.
Taking the role of guest speaker LIMRA International Master Trainer Dhiraj Malhotra followed Kumars address. Malhotra shared his thoughts on the value of need-based selling and the importance of building a strong element of trust with customers.
A high-powered panel discussion based on the theme of the congress followed. Moderated by chief guest, Insurance Board of Sri Lanka (IBSL) Chairperson Indrani Sugathadasa, the panel consisted of well-known leaders in the insurance industry: Ceylinco Life Managing Director/CEO R. Renganathan, SLIC Chairman Hemaka Amarasuriya, Union Assurance Director/CEO Dirk Pereira and AIA Director/CEO Shah Rouf.
The NAFLIA Congress also served as the launching event of the Life Insurance Awareness Month campaign. This year, the campaigns organisers intend to reach over one million persons across the island and provide insurance cover to
70,000 customers.
The lunch break preceded Dr. KumaIddamallenas motivational speech to boost the morale and energy of life insurance advisors. Following this inspiring session was a second panel discussion, moderated by Union Assurance General Manager Marketing and Distribution Rukman Weeraratne. The top MDRT qualifiers of nine insurance companies in Sri Lanka took part in the panel to share their success stories with the audience.

They demanded his ouster then; are now asking for his forgiveness
	

A yahapalanaya purohita linked to the Green party came under heavy fire from a group of Green party trade unionists as well as those with other affiliations of his own Ministry in the recent past.

These trade unionists who declared war on this purohita charged that he was trying to perpetuate a family rule. Some of them staged a fast too demanding his ouster.
However, the purohita remained unmoved when the hostile trade union groups were raising the battle cry against him and neither did the authorities concerned appear to heed the allegations being made against him either.
Meanwhile, to everyones surprise, the hostile trade unionists who were out for his blood had made a sudden U-turn. They had not only stopped the sabre rattling, but also had turned contrite and fallen at the feet of the much maligned purohita seeking his mercy and forgiveness, they say.
