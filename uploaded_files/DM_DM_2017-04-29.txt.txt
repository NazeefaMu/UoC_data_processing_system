Elon Musk assembles his robot army
	

Elon Musk has likened future versions of Teslas Model 3 production line to an alien dreadnaught - and now, the first pictures of that vision have emerged.
A Reddit user claiming to work for robot making company Kuka posted the images of what he says are 467 robots being delivered to the car-making firms California HQ.
SoutheastTraders forum user Mac11FA, via the Tesla subreddit, said he is a Field Service Engineer for Kuka Robotics.
The robots captured in the photos appear to be largely manufactured by Augsburg, Germany-based Kuka robotics, according to Teslarati. The robots, each costing anywhere between $50k to as much as $500k can manage multiple tasks by switching adapters and moving across multiple axes.
Kuka is the worlds leading provider of production systems in the automotive industry, the firm boasts on its website.
With years of experience, we are the master in the design of flexible and efficient production processes.
Mac11FA claims he is onsite at the Tesla factory for the next 7 weeks to help set up and commission 467 robots and 21 KL slides.
Tesla owners that were touring the factory over the past week have reported seeing the robots .
According to Teslarati, one owner from the Tesla Motors Club (Engle) said, You cant take photographs, but I can tell everyone that there is an enormous area of the factory where the Model 3 assembly line is being built. There are Kuka robots all over the place waiting to be installed. Its a beautiful thing.
Elon Musk has boasted the firms production facility for its much anticipated Model 3 will look like an alien dreadnought. Musk has said the facility, which is separate from the firms Gigafactory, will be the machine that makes the machine, and told analysts it will stun people. However, there will still be people working in the factory, though, mostly overseeing the robots and making sure everything is running at peak efficiency.
Most automakers test a new models production line by building vehicles with relatively cheap, prototype tools designed to be scrapped once they deliver doors that fit, body panels with the right shape and dashboards that dont have gaps or seams.tennis player Timo Boll for a recent TV spot.

Exchange Control Amendment Bill: Speaker receives 3 petitions filed in SC
	
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday announced that he received copies of three petitions filed in the Supreme Courts challenging the constitutionality of the Exchange Control Amendment Bill.
This Bill which seeks to repeal the present Act was presented to the House on April 7 this year.
This legislation seeks to repeal the Act and introduce fresh provisions giving the responsibility of promoting and regulating foreign exchange as the agent of the government.
Under this new Bill a person who holds foreign exchange in a bank account in Sri Lanka or owns any other foreign asset may utilize such foreign exchange for making any payment within and outside Sri Lanka.
In the case he or she does not hold foreign exchange it would be possible to convert these assets into foreign currency. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

GSP+ a platform for FTA with EU: Harsha
	
Regaining the GSP+ trade concession should be used as a platform for a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the European Union (EU), Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Harsha De Silva said yesterday.
He told a news briefing held at the Ministry that countries like Vietnam benefited from FTAs signed with the EU.
In the most likely event of our regaining the GSP+ facility, we should use the opportunity to create a FTA with the EU. The GSP+ concession isnt going to last forever. It will be in practice for four years at most. This is why we need to start discussions for a FTA which will give us a plethora of benefits. If we have an FTA, we can enjoy GSP+ continuously, Dr. De Silva said.
He said he would discuss this matter with the Prime Minister and had instructed the Sri Lankan Ambassador in Brussels to facilitate initial discussions with regard to entering into an FTA.
Dr. De Silva who was in Brussels to assist the Sri Lankan mission in laying groundwork to defeat a resolution tabled in the European Parliament against Sri Lanka being granted the GSP+ facility, said, defeating of the resolution was possibly Sri Lankas greatest victory in the International arena.
With 436 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) voting against the anti-Sri Lanka resolution only 119 voted in favour of the resolution, is a massive victory for the country. Although this was about GSP+, the vote showed the international community's confidence about the steps taken by Sri Lanka to establish democracy, he said adding that the country had overcome all the hurdles in the process of regaining the GSP+ facility with only the procedural steps not left to be completed.
Dr. De Silva said the European Council of Ministers will announce the final decision on granting the concession to Sri Lanka on or about May 15. We dont think the process will hit any more snags, he said and added that the country should diversify its exports and value added products with the intention of ultimately increasing the amount of exports so as to reap the benefits of GSP+.
This concession is not only about apparel anymore. We have to expand all our products and exports to the EU and other countries, Dr. De Silva said.
The GSP+ concession allows a developing country to pay less or zero duties on its exports to all 28 member-states of the EU.
In 2010, the EU withdrew the GSP+ trade facility given to Sri Lanka because of the significant shortcomings in respect of the countrys implementation of three UN human rights conventions relevant to qualify for the benefits under the scheme. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Houses built by MR regime distributed in Meethotamulla: JO
	
Joint Opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardena said yesterday the government had distributed houses built by the previous regime to the Meethotamulla victims even though former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa were blamed for the disaster.
He said the present government had stopped the housing project initiated by the previous government for the past two years and added that they should take the responsibility for it.
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka responded saying the housing project initiated by the previous government was not sustainable.
"The Urban Development Authority (UDA) had faced a grave crisis to continue the project as it was planned to be a Rs. 210 billion project whereas a debenture had been issued initially, only for Rs. 10 billion.
Mr. Gunawardene said the Disaster Management Ministry had been slow to react to the calamity at Meethotamulla and asked what the Flying Squad of the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) had been doing during the time.
He said there should be a stable mechanism to address the garbage crisis and added that a special legal mechanism and a central institute should be set up in this regard.
Mr. Gunawardane said the government should heed the warning of the Japanese experts with regard to the likely methane explosion at the Meethotamulla garbage dump.
The minister said there was no such threat as the methane level was below the level that could trigger an explosion. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Indian boats will be released only if SL fishermen agree
	
The boats of Indian fisherman which are now in Sri Lankan custody will only be released with the consent of the fisheries associations in the North, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
Minister Amaraweera recently said the government had not decided to discuss on the release of these boats during Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modis visit to Sri Lanka.
We have paid attention to release some of these boats in future since the Indian government has taken reasonable steps to solve this issue. There is nothing wrong in doing so, he said.
However, he said a flexible policy should always be followed to solve this issue and added that the Ministry would release these boats only with the approval of the representatives of the fisheries associations in North. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

luxury converted nuclear bunker in Georgia
	

Built entirely underground, it boasts three-foot-thick walls, a weapons room, a $100,000 CCTV system and evendecontamination showers.
The converted bunker, situated near Savannah, Georgia, is also said to be able to survive natural disasters, civil disturbances and terrorist attacks. And, it could be yours - if you are willing to fork out a staggering $17.5million.
Built during the Cold War in 1969 by the Army Corps of Engineers, the bunker was fully renovated in 2012, bringing it up to government standards.The property last went on the market in 2015, and property records show it is still owned by the seller Bastion Holdings. It is currently the only privately-owned underground bunker of its kind in the United States, according to its listing. In addition to its protection features - which also include air intake systems and a nurses room - the property contains more everyday elements. These include hot water, solar panels and humidity controls, says Bastion Holdings, which is selling the bunker. Constructed 45 feet below ground, on 32 acres of land, the home boasts two levels of living space, totaling around 14,000 square feet. Within this underground space, the second level features four luxury apartments, each approximately 600 square feet in size.
These contain their own kitchens, dining areas, two bedrooms, living rooms and bathrooms.
The first level, meanwhile, features a number of communal areas, such as a large home theater, a games room, a classroom and a workshop.It also has a separate staff quarters - should the buyer wishto employ. Although the seller is looking for anyone who might want to a new, unique home, the bunker is also being advertised as a potential
corporate retreat.
Alternatively, it could be used as a place to secure gold or other valuables, or as a training facility, according to its listing.
And it could even be the ultimate man cave for one lucky male.
Chris Salamone, co-owner of Bastion Holdings, a training company for government and security personnel, said: We are living in an increasingly dangerous world. This property offers the ultimate safe haven for any family, business or government that wants the ultimate in security and comfort.
Martin McDermott, CEO of the company and a counter-terrorism, surveillance and communications expert, added: This facility is impenetrable, while meeting the highest standards for quality, comfort and security. It is better to have it and not need it, than to need it and not have it.
Bastion Holdings had previously used the property as a training facility for military and government personnel.
The firm cannot disclose the exact location of the home forsafety reasons.

## Title: M.H. Mohamed the visionary

M.H. Mohamed the visionary
	
It was morning of Tuesday, January 12, 1960. History is being made inside the resplendent Satinwood Chamber of the majestic snowy building at Cinnamon Gardens called the Town Hall, resembling the Capital Building of Washington. The First Muslim Mayor of the City of Colombo is being elected. 
The oldest Local administration in Asia prided itself by conferring this honour on M.H. Mohamed, a veteran Councilor. 
This celebrated status opened the vistas for Mohamed to further enhance his prestige and position in the foreign clime as well A year later Dr. Inamullah Khan, the dynamic Secretary General of the World Muslim Congress (MOTAMAR) arrives in the country on a mission to nominate a prominent Muslim of Ceylon to represent the Rabitatul Alamul-Islami (RABITA), which was in the process of being formed in the Holy City of Mecca al-Mukarrama under the guidance of that great Mujahid His Majesty King Faisal of Saudi Arabia. 

He was received at the Ratmalana Airport by M.D. Kitchilan (Later Senator), Administrative Secretary of the All-Ceylon Muslim League and a host of other leaders like M. Faleel A. Caffoor (Later MP), M.H. Amit (Later MP), AM Nazeer (Later Deputy Mayor), A.C.A. Wadood (Religious Secretary of the League) and my humble self. 
The Muslim League accorded a reception to him the following day at its Headquarters in Fort, Colombo, chaired by Dr. M.C.M Kaleel, President. 
It was at this meeting that the Motamar SG announced the purpose of his visit. 

A list of names was prepared and duly handed over to him to take to Saudi. Dr. Inamullah Khan thereafter called on the First Muslim Mayor of Colombo at his office in Town Hall. The Pakistan leader was so impressed by the dynamism, charisma and the organisational skill displayed by Mayor Mohamed, and without the twinkling of an eye, his name was proposed. M.H. Mohamed thus became a Founder Member of the Constituent Council of RABITA. 
He took his seat in the hall of fame along with some of the most celebrated Islamic scholars of the world. To name a few: his Eminence Seyyed Amin al-Husseini, the Grand Mufthis of Palestine and President of Motamar (Which was the first world peoples body inaugurated in the holy City of Mecca), Dr. Said Ramadan, Director General of Geneva Islamic Centre, Sheikh Abulhassen Al-Nadvi, Rector of Nadwathul Ulema of Lucknow, Moulana Abul Ala Maudoodi, President, Jamat-e-Islami, Pakistan, Senator Ahamed Damacao Allento, Philippines, Omar Al-Saggaf, Singapore, Dr. Omar Nasif, Chancellor of King Abdul Aziz University (Later Secretary General, RABITA, His Eminence Sheikh Ban Baaz, Grand Mufthi of Saudi Arabia and Rector of Jamiah Medina, Abubucker Thawafa Balewa, Ex-President of Nigeria, Ahamed Bello, Sudan, Seyed Ahmed Turabi, Sudan, Suroor al-Sabban, Sheik Ali Al-Harkan, Chief Justice of Saudi Arabia, Sheikh Salih al-Gazzaz (The last being the successive Secretary General of RABITA, and Dr. Inamulla Khan himself of Pakistan. 
This significant achievement of Mohamed is ample proof to show that he basked in the glory international fame! 
He was instrumental in starting many a movement to serve his mother land, his community and the international brotherhood. A milestone of his career was the inauguration of the Sri Lanka Islamic Centre in Colombo under the aegis of the RABITA to co-ordinate all Islamic activities under one roof. 
It should be remembered here with gratitude the generosity of the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa, who then as Prime Minister and Minister of Local Government and Housing, donated the piece of land at his newly filled Town within Town Maligawatte Scheme. The ready assistance rendered by Sirisena Cooray (Ex-Mayor and Ex-Minister). Jehan Cassim (Chairman, Common Amenities Board, Senator S.Z.M. Mashoor Moulana and myself were acting as the go-betweens in selecting the present site. 
To add a personal note, it was at the inauguration ceremony of this Islamic Centre on 18.09.1982 that I was made to create a record. That was made possible, when President J.R. Jayewardene rose to add the gathering he bade me to interpret his speech simultaneously into Sinhala and Tamil. 
It was totally a new experience; as nervous as I was I did my best, and at the end felt relieved when Prime Minister Premadasa patted on my back and said aloud. Well done Azwer. 
It was around 1993 Dr. Abdul Aziz Al-Ammar, Secretary General of WAMY, Riyadh visited the Islamic Centre with a view to establishing the Asian Council of Darul Iftha- Dawa and Guidance. M.H. Mohamed, the Director General, was used his entire persuasive prowess to convince the Saudi delegation that Sri Lanka was the best place for an endeavour. After a birds-eye view of the entire situation the delegation selected Sri Lanka as this country represented a unique position in world community, where four great religions existed side by side in an atmosphere of harmony and friendship apparently not witnessed elsewhere in the region. 
Impact
The first impact in our country of the presence of Darul Iftha was felt with the visit of Sheikh Mohammed Ismail Bin Atheeq. He came with the first donations from this Riyadh based Islamic organisation with the visit for distribution among Mosques, Madrasas and other Islamic institutions. 
As member of RABITA Mr. Mohamed took the initiative of this distribution at a meeting convened at his residence Hafeera with the presence of the Darul Iftha Chief (Picture attached). 
It is in the fitness of things that Dr. Al-Ammar is now making a visit to our country as Minister of Islamic Religious Affairs of Saudi Arabia together with his delegation to set up the Asian Islamic Council with the participation of over fifty scholars and Islamic leaders representing countries from Asia, Africa, and Europe. The dominant feature underlining this World moot is very significant at this juncture in our history to promote inter-racial amity and harmony. 
The synthesis of Buddhist and Islamic idealism is sine qua non at this moment in history to build up unity among followers of these two religions based on the spread of Buddhist and Islamic dhamma of ahimsa and peace respectively. 
In fact Mohamed Haniffa Mohamed (As he was fondly called by the Islamic world) was a great visionary. He proved that he was totally committed to promote inter-racial amity and brotherhood when he, before other would think of it, to form a Forum for National Amity and Understanding under the roof of the Sri Lanka Islamic Centre, thus achieving the principle purpose of RABITAs global mission in promoting international peace and harmony! 
He showed remarkable statesmanship, when he roamed home, among others, erudite Buddhist scholars like Ven. Kumburugamuwe Vajira Nayake Thera (Vice-Chancellor of Sabaragumwa University) and Ven. Banagala Upatiss Nayaka Thera (Chief Sanganayake Thera of Japan and Chief of Mahabodhi Society of Sri Lanka) to occupy prominent positions in this Forum. 
The importance of this Inter-faith Conference will be further enhanced, as reported, with the participation of President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and other prominent leaders of all faiths in our country. In the political arena too, it was a meteoric rise for MH. Firstly, honour was bestowed upon his family when his grandfather M.C. Abdul Raheman was appointed as the First Muslim member of the Legislative Council by Governor Sir Arthus Elibank Havelock in 1889. 
Earlier, he achieved the singular honour of becoming the first-ever Muslim member of the Colombo Municipal Council. He rose to international fame by becoming the First Member of the Constituent Council of RABITA. 
71 long years after, lady luck smiled on his grandson, when M.H. Mohamed was elected as the First Muslim Mayor of the City Colombo. 
Yet again the Mohamed family achieved another milestone, when his eldest son Hussain Mohamed became the Mayor of Colombo  the First time a father and son occupying this prestigious position. (Presently, he has undertaken the tremendous responsibility of piloting the Sri Lanka Islamic Centre so well established by his dear father) 
M.H. Mohamed could claim credit to obtaining places for the Sri Lankan students at Jamiah Medina, the granting of Saudi Scholarship Fund, and obtaining other benefits from the Islamic Development Bank of the Kingdom. 
May the laudable mission undertaken by this celebrated leader during his life time bear fruit bringing benefits and solace to the people here and abroad- Ameen!

Music for Unity to support needy people in Poonakary
	

App Lanka will be hosting a concert themed Music for Unity as part of a long-term fundraising effort to support its projects in the north of Sri Lanka. A variety of musicians and school bands have pledged to perform at the event, which is set to take place on April 29 at the CR & FC grounds from 5 pm onwards. 
The concert will feature a diverse line-up of artists such as Magic Box Mix-up, En Route, Circus Cult, Kingdom Life, The Bakery, Slips, Neptune, D&D, Encore, Kryptonite, Diarra, Guest Stars, Melissa and Rapti. The concert is being hosted to bring youth and family members of all ages and from all walks of life together and to raise funds and awareness about App Lankas work in the north and east of Sri Lanka. 
Appe Lanka was initiated to continuously uplift and look in to the specific needs of community members in Poonakary, who were adversely affected by the civil war. The project primarily aims to promote the welfare of individuals in northern villages who are struggling to regain a sense of normalcy after the war. Additionally, the project offers psycho-social support to the youth of the community by inspiring schoolchildren and encouraging them to embrace an attitude of resilience and hopefulness. 
Commenting on the concert, Shaan Corea  Founder, App Lanka said: We always strive to support communities who live in outlying northern districts such as Poonakary. This concert is one of many fundraising events that will be held this year, to help us create awareness about our work in Poonakary and to raise funds for our projects. This months event is yet another important milestone that will enable us to continue our work. I would like to extend my sincere thanks and gratitude to all the musicians, organizations, corporates and individuals, who came forward to contribute towards this initiative. 
App Lanka recently celebrated the successful completion of its pilot project last December and assisted schoolchildren who needed a safe and reliable mode of transport to travel to school. It raised funds for a total of 75 bikes so that the children in Poonakary could safely travel to and from school. In January, the organization hosted a fun fair in collaboration with DS Poonakary and the Sri Lanka Army, which was attended by 400 people and featured traditional dances and performances by the army calypso band. The official App Lanka soundtrack will also be launched at the event.

## Title: Royal College the magnificent Group of 49 which produced 68% brilliant professionals
## Section: News Features

Royal College the magnificent Group of 49 which produced 68% brilliant professionals
	

In 1949, a group of 96 students were successful in gaining entrance to Royal College, having sat for an open competitive exam. About 60 of them were from Royal Prep, while the rest were from other schools including St Thomas Mt. Lavinia, Trinity College Kandy, St Josephs and St Peters. All students were about 10 years old and they were examined mainly on general intelligence and general knowledge, English, Sinhalese and arithmetic. Although Royal Prep bore the same name, there was no automatic entry to Royal College unlike several years before and after. 
The Head Master of Royal Prep was A.F. De Saa Bandaranayake, while the Royal College Principal was J.C.A. Corea - the first Ceylonese Principal. Initially, most of these boys did not take studies seriously, as a large number were from affluent families, being children of professionals. However, once they got into their respective disciplines, there was no turning back. Quite a number of them have reached the zenith of their professions. 
Royal College is indisputably the best school in the island. Most parents clamour to get their children into Royal but not all are lucky enough. People think of other public schools as second best. Royal and St Thomas (Mt Lavinia), are the most prestigious, like Eton and Harrow of England. 
Royal was founded in 1835 by the then British Colonial Government, mainly for the education of sons of Britishers, under the Head mastership of Rev. J.H. Marsh, Snr. Though the school was initially called the Colombo Academy, it came to be known later as Royal College. On the panels of the College Hall are the names of those who distinguished themselves in the field of intellect. 
Also in the College Hall hang the portraits of those who rendered yeoman service to the country. Amongst them are C.A. Lorenz KC, the Acting Queens Advocate, Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan Acting Attorney General and his brother Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam of the Ceylon Civil Service, Dr. C.A. Hewavitharane and his sibling Anagarika Dharmapala. Of the politicians of recent times were two heads of state  Sir John Kotalawala and President J.R. Jayawardene, while H. Sri Nissanka Q.C, a well-known criminal lawyer and one of the founders of the SLFP also adorn the Hall. 
Messers D.S. Senanayake, Dudley Senanayake and S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike were distinguished products of the school known by Royalists as the other school, namely, S. Thomas.
This batch came to be called the 49 Group. According to statistics compiled, it was perhaps the best batch that Royal has turned out in recent times. It is said that 32 of them became medical doctors, most of them consultants, while six entered the legal profession, two of them becoming Kings Counsel, two others becoming Judges of the Supreme Court, three entered the Ceylon Civil Service and eighteen became Engineers. 
It is estimated that about 68% of this group became professionals but while in school, each one of them fought for the last place in class! When they joined their respective disciplines, they outshone products of other schools. 
Some surgeons of the 49 Group are Ranjit de Silva  who captained Royal at cricket, Priya Samarasinghe, Geoff Vanden Driesen, Gamini Goonethilake, S.R. Ratnapala, whilst some of the well-known physicians are, Henry Rajaratnam, J.B. Pieris, Gamini Jayakuru, Brendon Gooneratne, the latter distinguishing himself in Australia. His wife, Yasmin Gooneratne, a Professor of English in Australia, has several publications to her credit. Another wife of a member of the 49 Group is Professor Lalitha Mendis, who reached the pinnacle of the medical profession. She was the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine and the Director of the Post Graduate Institute of Medicine. She is the wife of the late Dr. Lalith Mendis. 
The other physicians are Danilo de Kretser, Tissa Cooray (WHO), N.T. de Silva (UK), H.S. Karunasekera (UK), Leslie Muthukuda (UK), Dan Perimpanayagam, Yasa Rajapakse (UK), Disampathy Subasinghe (UK), V. Dharmapalan (New Zealand) and the late R.S.B. Wickremasinghe  who was the Director of the MRI. 
Of those who took to Law are two well-known Kings Counsel, Jayantha Gunasekera (Former Secretary of the Bar Association) and the late Chula de Silva. Two other lawyers S.W.B. Wadugodapitiya and P. Edussuriya ended up as Judges of the Supreme Court, whilst A. Balachandran worked in the UN. T.K.N. Thilakan (District Judge) and Kumar Ponnambalam both died a few years ago. Alavi Mohamed, a Barrister, also died several years ago. M.N.B. Pieris is a civil lawyer in Colombo. 
Harsha Wickremasinghe, D.G.P. Seneviratne and Dr. B.S. Wijeweera entered the prestigious Ceylon Civil Service. 
Of the Engineers that come to mind are Professor C.L.V. Jayathilake (a Vice Chancellor of Peradeniya), Dr. Susantha Goonethilake, S.C. Amarasinghe (former GM of the Electricity Board), Dr. Sri Bhavan Sri Skandarajah  Sri Bhavan in May 2013 staged a six-day fast in Canada in support of the LTTE diaspora (TGTE), H.S.B. Abeysundara (Chemical Engineer), L.H. Meegama, C. Ramachandran and Bandula Yatawara. 
Perhaps the cleverest of them all was Chelvanayagam Vaseeharan, a maths prodigy, who was appointed Professor of Mathematics. 
In this class were two leading businessmen, namely the Cambridge-educated Upali Wijewardene of the Upali Group and Lal Jayasundera, Chairman of Hayleys. Ratna Sivaratnam headed another conglomerate  Aitken Spence, whilst K. Manikkavasagar was a Director of Glaxo. Arjuna Hullugalle and Upatissa Attygalle are successful businessmen. 
V.H. Nanayakkara and P.H.J.S. Ariyapala both Bachelors of Science, joined the Royal College Staff. 
There was one member of the 49 Group who distinguished himself as a clever investigator in the Police Force. If he had not joined the Police, surely he would have been on the other side of the law! This was none other than Rahula Silva. It is reported that he was charged in several cases of violence. In all these cases he was successfully defended gratis, by his classmate Jayantha Gunasekera, a well-known criminal lawyer. 
There is the very talented Artist Laki Senanayake, who worked with Geoffrey Bawa, whilst A.A.Wijetunga and K. Sivapragasam became Senior Assessors in the Inland Revenue Department. K.L. Gooneratne is a talented Architect. 
Late Bimal Padamaperuma functioned as Chairman Engineering Corps and D.C. Wimalasena was Chairman, Petroleum Corps. 
T.D.S.A. Dissanayake, a prolific writer, first served in the UN. Later he became Ambassador to Indonesia. 

There are two members of this group for whom life was a ball! They were Aru Sellamuttu and Ranjit Kiriella. Nimalasiri Fonseka, a bright spark in school, lives the life of a Squire in England. 
Lionel Almeida and the late Tyrrel Muttiah took to planting and were ruggerites. The late W.K.N. de Silva was a propriety planter. Bobby Perera was a one-time Director of Quickshaws. Mahinda Gunasekera, who is permanently domiciled in Canada, does much for the country by countering false propaganda. 
These classmates are a very close-knit family, though half of them live overseas. The 49 Group, depleted as it is, gets together during the Royal-Thomian cricket encounter and the Bradby Shield. Sometimes they meet more often to welcome members coming home from abroad, for one reason or another. 
It is at such gatherings that they reminisce about their schooldays, some wild and others even wilder! Only the pleasantest memories remain, and old yarns are told and retold, with salt and pepper added! It is amazing that there isnt a tinge of jealousy and each one is proud of the others achievement. 
Masters then came to teach, in full suit (coat and tie, mind you) and some driving their own cars. They instilled into this impressionable group of youngsters all that Royal stood for; so much so that, even today, they instinctively take the acceptable course of action in any matter. 
As the College song goes, They learnt of books and learn of men, and learnt to play the game, being absolutely fair-minded in their dealings in later life. 
S.D. Sivapragasam 
A loyal Royalist.

Will return to politics in a big way: Tissa
	
UNP's former general secretary Tissa Attanayake said yesterday the UNP is not looking after the elephants which laboured for the party, but only serving the elephants which adorn the perahera.
He said this during a visit to the Kandy Mawilmada Watapuluwa Bodhi Malu Viharaya to pay homage to the Temple's Chief Incumbent the Ven. Mahaupadya Udawatte Nanda Thera.
Mr. Attanayake said as a life-long UNPer he was concerned about the members who had been ignored by the party.
I am staying away from politics for a while but will return to politics in a big way in the near future. I will have to decide on what I should do if I am invited to re-join the UNP. Keeping me away permanently does not hold good for the UNP. It is not me but the people who are raising their voices in support, he said.
He said that 12,000 members who were trained as organizers at the polling stations have been overlooked, and the plight of the local councillors was no better.
Mr. Attanayake said the UNP should have a plan for 2020 in case a common candidate is nominated with the support of the UNP because the result would be unpredictable.
On being asked about his future plans on entering politics, he said it was the time now to be silent. However, he said that the UNP members are curious as to whether he would return to politics and pointed out that even the Mahanayakes have expressed concern over the vacuum in the political leadership.
