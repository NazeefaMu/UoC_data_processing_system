He miscalculated his chances again
	

This politico, onetime bigwig of his political party pole-vaulted right into the arms of the former strongman on the eve of the January 8 big poll. And his miscalculation of the poll result proved almost politically fatal for him. 

However, our hero who would never say die made several overtures to his erstwhile leader, but received no positive response.
This politico heard that his former leader was due to attend a ceremony being organized in a big city in the hills to commemorate a former Big Boss. Fortunately he too had received an invitation to this event.
It occurred to the politico that this event was a god-sent opportunity for him to meet his former leader to confess and expiate the sin committed against him and the party. So he happily attended the commemorative ceremony.
When his former leader was arriving for the ceremony, our man was among the select group that moved forward to welcome him. Though he placed himself in an eye-catching position with a warm smile to greet the VIP guest, the latter did not seem to have noticed him. Our man had again tried to catch the attention of his former leader as the latter took his seat on the stage to no avail.
The ceremony over, our worthy determined to make his last bid, approached his onetime leader when he was about to step into the car waiting for him, but the latter ignored him and rode away.
And the crest-fallen politico rode away in the direction of Ududumbara, they say.

Her wiles and charms go a-begging
	

This former purohita was returned to Diyawanna from a district in the hills at the last general polls.

Once Green, the former purohita found the Betel leaf party now being buffeted by ill-winds is no longer conducive for his political health. So he made several bids to turn Green again without success.
Our man, a firm believer that failures are the pillars of success, has now enlisted the services of a mediator  a comely one to champion his cause with the Green leadership. This fair and lovely one, a popular actress to boot, is said to have carried out many missions on behalf of the former purohita with great success in the past. 
However, this time round all wiles and charms she has used on Green stalwarts on behalf of her long standing patron has so far failed to draw a positive response, they say.

HNBdelivers big in 2015; profits cross Rs.10bn mark
	
Hatton National Bank (HNB) group recorded net profit (equity holders of the bank) of Rs.10.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015 (FY15), up 7 percent year-on-year (yoy) and a net profit of Rs.3.57 billion for the fourth quarter (4Q15), the interim financial accounts showed.
The basic earnings per share (EPS) for the year improved to Rs.26.09 while the quarterly EPS stood at Rs.9.41.
The pre-tax profit for the year was Rs.16.2 billion, up 23 percent yoy and the after-tax profit stood at Rs.11 billion, up 10 percent yoy.
At the bank level, HNB posted a profit before tax of Rs 15 billion and a profit after tax of Rs 10.4 billion for the same period.
This is the first time the bank surpassed the Rs 10 billion landmark in PAT, driven by a more than 25 percent growth in both advances and deposits, HNB said in a statement. 
Commenting on the performance HNB Managing Director/CEO Jonathan Alles said: We are pleased to share our performance that surpassed many milestones during the year. The Banks profit before VAT and tax improved to Rs 17.9 billion, whilst profit after tax surpassed Rs 10 billion during the year.
Both advances and deposits of the bank increased by over Rs 100 billion, once again the highest in the banks history whilst the NPA ratio improved to 2.43 percent, the lowest in the past few decades. It is significant that this NPA was achieved whilst attaining a loan growth of 26 percent and was a result of the proactive efforts and commitment of our recovery teams at head office and across the country.
The growth in advances was propelled by a 30 percent growth in corporate banking, 25 percent growth in SME, 65 percent growth in leasing and a 67 percent growth in personal loans.
The banks CASA ratio also remained strong at 42 percent, despite the shift witnessed from low cost deposits towards higher yielding fixed deposits during the year.
These efforts resulted in net interest income (NII) for the bank growing by 5.8 percent to Rs 26.3 billion, despite the banking sector margins continuing to drop during 2015. As at end 2015 the bank maintained a net interest margin (NIM) of 4.5 percent.
The group witnessed a higher growth in NII of 14.3 percent to Rs 29.7 billion as a result of the banks acquisition of Prime Grameen Micro Finance during the latter part of 2014, now rebranded as HNB Grameen.
HNB Grameen has become a formidable force in the micro finance industry in Sri Lanka with the company witnessing its loan book growing by 66 percent and deposits by 46.4 percent during 2015.
The banks commission income for 2015 grew by 18.4 percent to Rs 5.8 billion with major contributions coming from merchant acquisitions, guarantees and trade business.
Fee income generated from electronic channels too witnessed significant growth during 2015. The group witnessed its fee income growing by 23.1 percent with the commission income from HNB Grameen and Acuity contributing significantly and complimenting the performance of the Bank on commission income.
During the year 2014, the bank realised a capital gain of Rs 889 on account of the sale of shares held in Visa Inc and MasterCard. The absence of any realised capital gains from equity investments in 2015, resulted in lower net gain from financial investments for the period under review.
The volatility of exchange rates during the year and the significant depreciation of the Rupee, aided the bank to record substantial growth in exchange income. 
Accordingly, the bank recorded a total operating income of Rs 34.8 billion for 2015, while the group recorded Rs 42.6 billion with a growth of 12.7 percent for the same period.
The banks process improvement and cost optimization initiatives over the recent years, saw operating expenses contained to a marginal 3.9 percent increase. This is one of the lowest cost increases the bank has witnessed during the recent past.
It is pertinent to mention that this was achieveddespite 2015 being a year for collective agreement where salaries of non executive staff wererevised, continuing to retain HNBs superior rewards position in the market, HNB said.
The cost increase reported by the group is higher at Rs 22.5 billion, which is a 13.8 percent increase from 2014. This is as a result of the additional cost that came about through the consolidation of HNB Grameen and due to the high claims ratio witnessed by HNB General Insurance for 2015.
The bank improved its cost to income ratio to 45.95 percent in 2015 compared to 47.41 percent in 2014 which is a significant achievement during the year.
The bank was successful in reducing the NPA ratio to 2.43 percent compared to 3.16 percent recorded in the previous year and 3.2 percent reported by the industry in 2015. As a result the impairment charges for the bank reduced significantly by 62.6 percent to Rs 0.9 billion.
The banks effective tax rate increased to 30.6 percent from 25.4 percent recorded in 2014.
During 2014 the bank received several tax credits resulting in the effective tax rate being low. In addition, the bank paid Rs 2.1 billion as super gain tax resulting in a total tax charge of approximately Rs9.5 billion for 2015.
The bank recorded a return on asset (ROA) of 1.6 percent and return on equity (ROE) of 16.6 percent.
HNB has been able to enter into long term funding agreements with reputed development financial institutions and multilateral funding agencies such as the ADB, DEG and Proparco.
The bank was able to supplement its deposit growth with US $ 185 billion in borrowings through these agreements. These funds raised have been mainly utilized towards financing SME and infrastructure development projects.
The significant growth in the loan book and the super gains tax of Rs 2.1 billion paid during 2015 resulted in the banks tier 1 and tier 2 ratios dropping by 162 bps and 2.13 bps to 10.53 percent and 12.70 percent respectively as at December 31, 2015.
The bank declared a final divided of Rs 7.00 per share consisting of a cash dividend of Rs3.50 and scrip dividend of Rs 3.50 per share, while in December it made an interim dividend of Rs 1.50 per share. As such the total gross dividend on account of profits made in 2015 amounts to Rs 3.4 billion.

JHU disapproves Govt. response to GMOA
	
The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) said in a statement yesterday that the Government must respond wisely to the ideas and arguments of the professionals on the proposed Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) without making speeches undermining the GMOA, which is a recognised professional organisation.
JHU Media Secretary Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said that responses of certain Ministers and Government leaders to the ideas, arguments and objections of the professionals regarding the ECTA was unethical and that the Government must be mindful, when reaching economic, trade and technological agreements between two countries, as no one can foretell the short term and long term impact on the economy, society and politics through such agreements.
The Government must engage in open and intelligent discussion with the relaxant and educated professionals about such agreements. The Government must respond to the ideas and arguments of the professionals wisely. It is not suitable to the Good Governance principles to undermine the GMOA. It is not the way to resolve and manage issues by undermining the professionals and provoking them, Warnasinghe said.
He said in a statement that it would be prudent to resort to wise and intelligent discussion about the ETCA and stop boasting about it so that people could be well informed.
We hope that engaging in cordial discussion with the professionals about the agreement would not cause any disadvantage to the countrys future. We stress that the government must not suppress or insult the professionals who represent the countrys educated society directly or indirectly, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Much ado over a front row seat
	

There was a big celebration recently in a city in Rajarata presided over by the Big Boss.

A certain state purohita who attended the ceremony was chagrined to find that no chair had been reserved for him in the front row on the stage. Incidentally this state purohita was one of the few Betel leaf stalwarts who quit the previous regime to throw in his lot with the movement formed to herald a yahapalanaya in the country.
Later the disgruntled purohita had a brush with the organizers over their failure to offer him a front-row seating on the occasion and left the venue in a huff.
On learning that the state purohita in question had boycotted the ceremony for not being accommodated in the front row, the Big Boss had observed that the front row seats were meant for the purohitas at Cabinet level. Therefore, the state purohita had no reason to feel affronted.
On being informed, that the one who boycotted the event had been billed to address the public meeting, the Big Boss asked the organizers to accord this honour to a young junior Diyawanna member present on the occasion.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the opposition were engaged in an argument in Parliament yesterday over an Indian ambulance service which is to be begun shortly in the Southern and Western Provinces.
The argument was triggered when opposition MP Bandula Gunawardena asked why the government had allowed an Indian NGO to start an ambulance service in Sri Lanka without informing anyone or even Parliament. The MP charged that this had been done without even advertising for local organisations to submit applications to provide such a service.
Mr. Wickremesinghe said India and Sri Lanka would conduct the service jointly for two years and it would be handed over to Sri Lanka after that.
Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake asked whether the Sri Lankan government was making some payment to India for the service. The Premier said a certain sum would be paid.
Responding to another question from the opposition (as to whether the government could not find any local partner to run this service) the Prime Minister said the opposition should name a local partner who was willing and able. (Yohan Perera)

SLFP CC stops split in party
	
In a bid apparently to counter the demands within the SLFP to form a new political party or act as an independent group in Parliament by certain members of the party, the SLFP Central Committee had decided to ban members from participating in events or discussions that would lead to form a separate group in Parliament, sources told today.
Highways Deputy Minister and SLFP Spokesman Dilan Perera told the weekly SLFP media briefing yesterday that the SLFP Central Committee that met recently chaired by Party Chief President Maithripala Sirisena took this decision, with the agreement of all members and also decided to take strict disciplinary action against those, who violate party directives.
Deputy Minister Perera said the SLFP General Secretary, Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayaka was tasked to inform all SLFP members on the Central Committee decision.
He added the SLFP high command would not tolerate propaganda, discussions, action or conversing hereafter among members to form a new political party or act as an independent group in Parliament within the SLFP.
The directive had been proposed some time ago but not approved by the Central Committee. However, the party decided to approve and make it effective under the prevailing situation, Perera said.
Deputy Minister Perera said only Parliamentarians Dinesh Gunawardane, Vasudeva Nanayakkara, Wimal Weerawansa, and Udaya Gammanpila of the UPFA talk about new political parties and act as independent members within the Joint Opposition.
The support to them among other UPFA members is dwindling rapidly. Before long, the talk about new parties and new Parliamentary groups will come to a whimper, he said.
Commenting on certain remarks made by Parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila at a media event on SLFP Ministers in the Consensual Government comparing them to lap dogs, Deputy Minister Perera said he did not want to talk much about animals as there were so many Uru Meeya (Bandicoots), Urulewa (Minor Indian Civet), Unahapuluwa ( Slender Loris) and, the Pissu Puasas (Crazy Cats), in the present day politics in the country and asked not to take much notice of a politician, who does not belong to any political party.
Perera expressed his satisfaction over Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes consent to accept the amendments proposed by the UPFA to the resolution now in debate in Parliament to establish a Constitutional Assembly to draft the new Constitution or introduce amendments to the Constitution.
Premier Wickremesinghe has already agreed to the nine amendments the SLFP had proposed to the resolution.
At a discussion the UPFA had with him in Tuesday afternoon, he accepted the amendments proposed by the UPFA. It is a very positive sign to speed up the Constitutional reform process, he stressed.
Deputy Minister Perera said a new political culture had come to prominence since the Consensual Government came to power, which is not to oppose each and every move of the UNP by the SLFP and vice-versa, which will auger well for the countrys progress. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Sweet transaction brings him sweet profits
	

The hero of this story is a purohita well known for his political shenanigans. Several state-owned factories turning out a sweet product indispensable to every household come under the purview of his Ministry.

This sweet product is usually released to the market in metric tons. One of these factories the other day had a stock of about 2,000 metric tons of the stuff ready for release to the market. Say at that point of time the wholesale price of the product in the market was Rs.70 a kilo. But this entire stock was suddenly sold to a certain businessman at the rate of Rs.61 a kilo.
The head of the institution running the factory was not in favour of this deal, but he had to dispose of the stock for a price much below the prevailing one in the market on an order from his political authority.
The lucky businessman who purchased the stock had re-sold it to a Pettah wholesale dealer at the rate of Rs.69 a kilo the following day itself thus making a tidy profit running into several millions of rupees overnight.
The sweetest part of the story had come out only after the sweet product had reached the Pettah wholesale dealer. The businessman who made a massive profit overnight from the transaction had been no lesser person than the political authoritys own brother!
And this was not the first time  not likely to be the last one either -the lucky brother had collected such a windfall. He had made similar fortunes on two to three previous occasions as well, they say.

The former strongmans lawyers had got busy getting up papers to move for bail for the former aide and his mates at a higher court. The wife of the former strongmans aide too had been with the team of lawyers to help wrap up the bail application in respect of her husband. Meanwhile, another lady who had arrived in the company of a lawyer too was seen signing legal documents to apply for bail for the same white collar one.
The lawyers involved, finding two ladies signing two separate bail applications for the same official had looked askance at one another. Inquiries that ensued had led to an altercation between the two ladies.
Later some VIPs had to intercede to settle the fight between the two fair ones, each fiercely claiming her right to look after the interests of the white collar one languishing at Welikada.
The fight between the two ladies at court premises is not going to be the last to be heard of this affair and the real showdown over an issue at family level is due to take place inside a courtroom shortly, informed ones say.

UB Finance reaches Eastern region with Kalmunai
	
UB Finance, a subsidiary of Union Bank of Colombo PLC, has successfully implemented its branch expansion initiative so as to cater to the needs of its customers islandwide. UB Finance proudly opened its second branch for the year recently in Kalmunai.
As such, this is the first UB Finance branch to extend its services to its customers in the Eastern region and be part of the economic development. Having extended its services to Colombo and other suburban regions, UB Finance will be a potential partner who will assist the community in the East for their financial purposes.
The Kalmunai branch was opened following the launch of the Gampaha branch, which took place in January 2016. With its rapid expansion strategy, the UB Finance growth plan concentrates on launching branches in other regions of the country focusing different viable industries. Therefore, UB Finance will be able to partner with various ventures and ensure that its services are catered to the fullest ability within each region.
During 2015, UB Finance extended its services to Matara, Panadura, Mawanella, Polonnaruwa and Nuwara Eliya.
Many dignitaries including Director/Chief Executive Officer Ransith Karunaratne and Chief Operating Officer Suresh Kandiah participated in this opening ceremony along with many other individuals including the Sinhala, Muslim and Tamil business community, the agro and fisheries community and other professionals. The ceremony was made more glamorous with various cultural performances.

Kalmunai, a city which was once devastated as a result of the civil unrest, is striving to blossom as a prosperous city once again. People in various industries including fisheries, farming, garments, etc., could be found and therefore, UB Finance promises to be a flexible and a reliable financial partner for these small and medium enterprise (SME) segments. This is one primary goal in the rapid branch expansion process. As such, UB Finance has continued to create innovative and tailor-made products to allow its customers to achieve their aspirations.
UB Finance is looking forward to extend its services to those involved in every viable industry by providing working capital through factoring and easy draft products. UB Finance identifies door-to-door campaigns as an essential practice that contributes to its success and therefore town-storming and door-to-door campaigns are conducted in covering different geographical locations, including suburbs. Through these initiatives, UB Finance can reach out to a bigger community thereby extending its services for the benefitof customers.
UB Finance plans to extend its network further in the East and to more strategically important locations islandwide during the year ahead.

University of Texas at Austin to allow students to carry handguns on campus
	
Students at the University of Texas at Austin will soon be allowed to carry handguns on campus.
University of Texas President Gregory Fenves approved Wednesday the guidelines for gun owners in light of a recently passed state law allowing guns on campuses.
"I have thoroughly reviewed the policy recommendations of the Campus Carry Working Group and decided to adopt them," Fences said. "Under the law, I cannot adopt a policy that has the general effect of excluding licensed concealed handguns from campus."
In 2015, the Republican-led Texas Legislature voted to allow guns within buildings on public college campuses throughout the state.
The bill requires a university president to adopt and implement the law. Open carry on campus is still prohibited. According to the University of Texas at Austin, since the law says you have to be 21 before applying for a concealed carry license, fewer than 1% of students will qualify for a license to carry a concealed weapon in classrooms or academic buildings.
Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Mississippi, Utah, Wisconsin and Oregon also allow students to carry concealed handguns on campus. In Georgia, lawmakers are also considering on Thursday a measure that would allow guns on college campuses.
But the move by the University of Texas is controversial. In October, CNN reported more than 280 professors and counting have signed a petition calling the new legislation a "direct assault on our free speech rights."
The possibility of guns in the classroom is going to "interfere with students' free speech in the classroom," a place already often tense when certain issues are raised, said Ellen Spiro, professor at UT's Department of Radio-TV-Film and co-founder of the newly formed Gun Free UT. (CNN)

Warning about a time bomb ready to burst
	

This Betel leaf one is a powerful political character hailing from the South.

He is in charge of a very important Ministry which boasts a large media unit equipped with millions of rupees worth of state of the art accoutrements. Although this unit is meant for covering the official events of the Ministry, it is being deployed to cover such activity as weddings, funerals, Pirith and Dana ceremonies, cricket tournaments, etc. in the electorate of the purohita, they say.
According to ministry employees, millions of public funds are spent a month on the private events and functions being covered by the ministry media unit. The officials compelled to approve the expenditure involved in deploying the media unit for private purposes at the behest of the purohita are said to be in a blue funk that one day their career might end up at Welikada state-run lodge. This illegal activity continuing unchecked could be a time bomb that would blow up in the face of all involved sooner or later, say the Ministry employees.

Wedding receptions at Sooriyawewa Stadium: Dayasiri
	
The Rs. 4.2 billion international cricket stadium built in a god-forsaken land in Sooriyawewa is being hired out for wedding receptions, Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera revealed in Parliament yesterday.
The revelation comes just days after Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe visited the sports facility last weekend and had discussions with relevant authorities on how to maximise the utilisation of the stadium in the future.
Responding to an oral question raised by MP Hesha Vithanage, the Minister said the stadium is being hired out at a fee of rupees ten thousand.  There are issues with the stadium that needs to be resolved,  the Minister said.
The venue built to host some of the World Cup matches in 2011 has so far played host to 11 one day internationals and nine T20 matches since its inception in 2011.
The construction of the stadium in Hambantota was part of former regimes ambitious plan to make city of Hambantota an international sporting hub, but abandoned plans when the city lost the bid to host the 2018 Commonwealth Games. Had Sri Lanka won the bid, the cricket stadium was to host the opening and closing ceremonies of the games.
Minister Jayasekara said the stadium should be made use of as a huge amount of funds had been spent for its construction.
We cannot allow the stadium to go waste as a huge amount of funds have been spent for it, he added.
However he said lack of hotels in the close proximity of the stadium had contributed to its low usage. The players have to travel a long way since there are no hotels close by, he added.
He said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had suggested that the stadium should be used for training purposes and this would be considered in the future. (Yohan Perera)

A stroke of fortune shrouded in mystery
	

This onetime powerful Diyawanna member whose name was mentioned in connection with many a shady deal exposed in the recent past, was rumored to be in debt to banks to the tune of millions of rupees.

There were also reports that certain banks had sold under the hammer some properties belonging to the better-half of the politico to recover the debts, but what they could get back amounted to only 10 per cent of what the politico owed the banks, they say.
Meanwhile, there is a story doing the rounds that the politico had purchased a rice mill and many wonder how he could raise money to buy it, if he were really bankrupt.
This politico who once wielded much political clout as the point man of the former strongman in his hay day is said to have pole-vaulted to yahapalanaya following the regime change.
He has also become a blue-eyed boy of some characters with close ties to the powers that be, they say.

BC arrests two more over Rs. 125mn bribe
	
Officials of the Bribery Commission arrested two more customs officers connected to the case where Rs. 125 million was solicited from a spare- part businessman in Panchikawatta. 
The two customs Superintendents were arrested at the Customs Headquarters this morning, Bribery Commission Director (Investigations) SSP Priyantha Chandrasiri said. 
Three customs officials were arrested last October by the Bribery Commission during a raid, where Rs. 125 million, was being exchanged between the three officers and the businessman. 
The customs officials had first solicited Rs. 150 million, to release imported spare parts worth Rs. 1.5 billion without any duty payment, but the bribe was then brought down to Rs. 125 million.
The customs officials arrested in October, and released on bail in December, have been banned from travelling abroad and were asked to report to the Bribery Commission on the last Sunday of each month. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Discretion is the best part of valour
	

There was an informal minor debate in the House lobby the other day. Several members from both sides of the great divide expressed their candid views on the subject of the debate: The case against the second son of the former strongman.

Some of them berated the Police. Some blamed the government. There were some who took up the position that anyone found to have committed an offence should be taken to task irrespective of his or her status.
As the debate was raging, a purohita of Cabinet rank holding a portfolio relevant to the South of the country looked on quietly. Irked by the deafening silence on the part of the purohita, an opposition stalwart challenged him to say his piece for or against the lawsuit instituted against the once highly pampered kid now down and out.
Malli, I cant condone the action taken against the boy, the purohita opened up at length. I am not happy about the situation our former boss is placed in either. I would be only inviting trouble if I were to speak out about these matters. So keeping mum is good for my health The purohita sloped off after voicing his viewpoint.

Doctor convicted of killing husband fears deportation to SL
	
The lawyer for a Geraldton doctor who bludgeoned her sleeping husband to death with a mallet after years of abuse says his client believes she will be deported to Sri Lanka once she is released on parole.
Chamari Liyanage, 36, stood trial for murdering her husband Dinendra Athukorala in their home in, Geraldton, Western Australia in June 2014, but a Supreme Court jury convicted her of the lesser charge of manslaughter.
Liyanage has been sentenced to four years in jail and with time already served, could be released in July.
During the trial the court heard how their five-year marriage was defined by the "worst kind" of escalating sexual, physical and emotional abuse.
Liyanage testified she had tried to leave her husband six times but was trapped in a cycle of abuse with someone who was "a monster".
Her lawyer, George Giudice, said his client would appeal against her manslaughter conviction.
He said she was concerned she would be deported.
"She is a permanent resident and as you know she's a doctor, the story goes that once she's released they'll deport her immediately," he said.
"That's what she believes to be the situation." (ABC)
