Aloysius requested me to 'conceal vital info.' : witness
	
The Pan Asia Bank (PABC), Deputy General Manager R. A. B. Dias today said that the owner of Perpetual Treasuries Ltd, Arjun Aloysius, had asked him ?to conceal vital information? when testifying before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry.
The revelation was made when the witness was questioned by Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunathilake regarding the previous testimony he gave about Mr. Aloysius? request prior to him giving evidence before the PCoI.
The solicitation had been allegedly made during a meeting, which took place on June 30, 2017 at the residence of Mr. Aloysius, with whom the DGM of the PABC was with.
Earlier, it was revealed that the witness had visited Mr. Aloysius' residence subsequent to the continuous phone calls made by Mr. Aloysius demanding a short meeting with the witness prior to his testimony at PCoI.
?Mr. Arjun phoned me on June 30 and was pleading to meet me, and I also wanted to meet him to get certain clarifications. When we met he said the next two weeks are crucial to him, therefore he needed my support at the PCoI proceedings ?, the witness said in his earlier evidence.
Meanwhile, during the cross- examination led by Mr. Nihal Fernando PC and Counsel Romali Tudawe, the witness exposed certain matters regarding the Bonds that were sold to the EPF in the secondary market, where PABC acted as an intermediary.
According to the witness, during the intermediary process, the PABC had also sold Rs. 8.5 billion worth of Government Securities of its former chairman, Nimal Perera, and the securities belonging to his private company called ?NP Capital? to the EPF.
The amount was in relation to only 32 secondary market transactions, on which PTL lawyers had been cross examining the witness.
He explained that Mr. Nimal Perera had pre-arranged the rates and prices at which the bonds would be sold to EPF. ?He had negotiated with the EPF dealer, Saman Kumara directly about the rates and had informed PABC to confirm them and continue with the deals?, he said.
The PABC was handling the portfolio of its Chairman in the secondary market transactions.
When questioned by the Commission, the witness explained that apart from its former chairman, there were five clients of the PABC who had sold Bonds to the EPF, where PABC acted as an intermediary.
Navara Capital, Virtual Investments, Tradies Holding, Vitavel Private Ltd and Trillion Securities were the companies which had dealt with PABC when selling bonds to the EPF in the secondary market.
Acceding to the commission?s request, the witness agreed to provide details about the directors and shareholders of those companies for the perusal of the PCoI.
It was explained that these clients of PABC had also sold bonds to the EPF at a rate similar to Mr. Nimal Perera?s rates in selling bonds to the EPF.
He said that its dealers were negotiating with the EPF on behalf of its clients to decide on the rates.
The witness said that Mr. Nimal Perera and Perpetual Treasuries Ltd had sold bonds to the EPF at a pre-arranged higher rate through PABC, and based on that the PABC also traded with its other clients in the intermediary process.
The witness said that there was a manipulation in market rates because of the long term bonds. ?If we set a batting wicket in a cricket match, the opposite team could also get the advantage of it, that is exactly what happened?, he said
He said the PABC gained only a nominal profit while the actual profits went to its clients during these transactions, where the PABC acted as an intermediary.
Consequent to the questions made by PTL counsel Romali Tudawe regarding the 32 specific secondary markets transactions, which were reflected in a marked document at PCoI, the witness said that the information relating to transactions between the PABC and its clients during the intermediary process was not reflected in the document due to the shortcomings of its back office officials.
However, he said the information would be available in the bank?s internal records if necessary.
Referring to a specific transaction, which had been recorded in the document, the counsel questioned the reason for the contradictory practice of recording, and the witness said that it was a mistake of the back office.
Re-examining the witness, the DSG told the commission that there was a pattern visible in the transactions where PTL sold bonds to the EPF through PABC because in such instances there were other clients of the PABC, who existed in between those transactions.
The Commission also permitted the DSG to submit a document prepared by the Attorney General?s Department depicting the alleged pattern derived from the document that contains a large amount of secondary market transactions. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

## Title: Asking for keeps: ?Gamperaliya? and ?Nidhanaya?
## Section: News Features

Asking for keeps: ?Gamperaliya? and ?Nidhanaya?
	
?
The loveliest scene in Nidhanaya is the only hopeful, life-affirming sequence from that entire movie: Willie Abeynayake, the tortured aristocrat, dancing with the woman he married to kill as a sacrifice.?
?
?
It builds up slowly (to a waltz composed by Premasiri Khemadasa) and then flourishes in quiet, contained ecstasy. The best part about it is that it?s all imagined. Willie isn?t actually dancing with his wife, Irene; he?s dreaming that he is. Technically it stands out, not just from the movie, but also from the director?s oeuvre, because it?s fascinating in how the eyes of this couple interlock, how the waltz teeters between hope and distrust, and how the man is awoken from his fantasy. It?s also poignant, because these two never consummate their love. ?
Nidhanaya was the third of three movies made by Lester James Peries for the only producer that remained with him for more than two, Ceylon Theatres. It proved that with the right blend of capital and artistic freedom, he could churn out a technically and artistically fulfilling film. Like much of his other work, though, it was barely a box-office hit, nevertheless compensated by its wins abroad (in London and in Venice). When in 1997 the government compiled a list of the 10 best movies from the preceding 50 years, it was unanimously accepted as the greatest. It may have been the first Sinhala movie that was made to be conscious of its own power. ?
G. B. Senanayake?s short story, one of several compiled in an anthology, Paliganima, came about after blindness had struck him. There?s a streak of schizophrenia in much of his subsequent work. Some of his novels, like Awaragira and Ekata Eka, while not optimistic, opened out in a wider milieu, which compensated for that. With Nidhanaya, however, he constricted it, forcing us to ponder on its own workings without daring to venture out. In Willie Abeynayake he channelled the unnamed narrator from Allan Poe?s The Raven, which is why Lester?s movie feels rather expressionistic, so expressionistic, in fact, that we see cobwebs and stuffed birds in his protagonist?s mansion even when there aren?t any. Like Lewin?s film of Wilde?s The Picture of Dorian Gray, it was deeply, maddeningly claustrophobic. ?
And in a way, the tragedy that befalls Abeynayake is reminiscent of the tragedies that befall Poe?s as well. The latter are always self-absorbed, rarely open to the world outside. They are driven by their obsessions, even at the cost of another?s life, but when they face the fact that all those were for nothing, they end their own. They are carried away by their madness, but they retain the welter of self-sacrifice and honour and dignity that dawn on them only when they realise their follies. ?
It?s a self-contained world, cast away, obsolete, largely irrelevant, that we come across in Nidhanaya. It?s not the world of the Kaisaruvattas, because the Kaisaruvattas didn?t fall, they deteriorated. Perhaps that?s why Gamperaliya is so elegiac, while Nidhanaya is almost a preannounced funeral and memorial service from beginning to end. ?
When Lester was filming Martin Wickramasinghe?s novel, he was viewed with suspicion by the big producers (among them Ceylon Theatres), which in hindsight was justifiable; his cameraman Willie Blake was eschewing the studio for the sun when it came to lighting. It?s not easy to make a Gamperaliya now, because that sense of harmony between its cast and crew members isn?t easy to obtain. ?
?
?
But it isn?t just the cast and crew, or the camerawork. It?s also the timing. Speaking for myself, I haven?t come across a Sinhala film that had everything right, correct, to the dot, and yet appeared so spontaneous with respect to its characters? reactions. When Piyal suggests that Nanda come to his house after they stop hearing from Jinadasa, for instance, the camera cuts to Nanda slowly, excruciatingly, highlighting her feelings of insecurity. When she finally cracks, however, it doesn?t flow out like a wound; it?s quickly done away with, so quickly that Piyal is as shocked as we are at his callousness. That opening scene at the mansion, with the upstart teaching the lady English (the educated aren?t rich, yet) and Nanda?s mother tending to her needlework behind, has become something of an epiphany for our cinema, ?both in what he (Lester) tried to express in all his films as well as in the simple, elegant, and unostentatious way he said it? as Tissa Abeysekara put it later. ?
In Nidhanaya Lester broke away from that simple, elegant, and unostentatious way of saying things.
He was too emboldened, too empowered, to continue with that Renoirean simplicity which characterised all his movies until then. Partly this was because he was now under a contract which was, for the second time (after Cinemas Entertainment for Sandeshaya), stipulated by a major production company. He had upset his benefactors with Golu Hadawatha (which, were it not for Bernard Soysa?s timely intervention, would have been released without Dammi?s version of the story) and had scored a mild success with Akkara Paha. Both would be featured at the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) courtesy of Donald Richie, through which Lester was introduced more properly to the world he had been inspired by. ?
?
In Nidhanaya Lester broke away from that simple, elegant, and unostentatious way of saying things
Consequently, Lester?s eighth film was also his first self-conscious work. ?It reeks of noirishness. Worse, it reeks of intellectualised noirishness,? Pauline Kael wrote of Neil Jordan?s Mona Lisa, and the same could have been said of Nidhanaya, with the caveat that it doesn?t reek, it overwhelms. Everything in this unquiet masterpiece constricts, from Willie Abeynayake?s search for a virgin with four birthmarks (consisting of a series of close-ups, almost suffocating) to the moment he catches his sight of Irene (initially as a long shot, then zooming in to an extreme close-up) and to Irene?s futile attempts to get him to love her (in one of the movie?s most disturbing and memorable sequences, she wanders off from their first night in bed and gazes sorrowfully at the portrait of his mother: the whole scene is punctured by a musical variation on the Buddhist stanza venerating the mother, adding irony). ?
But all this meant that Lester had abandoned his humanist streak, a little of which was retained in the movie?s most heartfelt section (where Willie and Irene are reconciled to each other). In abandoning it, he had abandoned what had characterised his work before. Death, decay, and self-destruction: none of these had obtruded on his world. Even in Akkara Paha, which is his first film about the downfall of the village peasantry, tragedy is briefly superseded by a sense of bittersweet poignancy, particularly towards the end. In Nidhanaya there?s no poignancy, only complete annihilation (because Willie is the last male heir to his lineage) that?s quickened by an unyielding destiny. It was a quirk in that respect: after it was done, Lester would return to that same humanism he had repudiated through Desa Nisa. ?
For all its exquisite attention to detail, and its constricting interiors, it became a masterpiece despite its deep-rooted cynicism. If Gamperaliya had been the work of an ambitious idealist, Nidhanaya was the work of an empowered idealist. Because of its outlook perhaps, however, it was shunned by some of our critics, and compelled Regi Siriwardena (in a perceptive essay titled ?Sinhala Cinema, Class and Personal Relations?) to take to task those among them who had taken Lester?s attention to the individual as a sign of the social irrelevance of his work. ?
He was right, I should think; whether or not you identify the abnormal, stunted psychology of its characters, Nidhanaya is a rich work of art, rich in its depiction of a milieu that Lester would not (barring Awaragira) feature with such unforgiving ferocity. ?Nowhere else has ensemble playing been so perfect in my films,? he said of Gamperaliya, adding the caveat: ?Except in Nidhanaya.? The comparison shows, I believe, notwithstanding the thematic differences between the two. ?

Australia to provide Rs. 116 mn for Dengue control
	
Visiting Australian Foreign Minister Julia Bishop said the Australian government will assist Sri Lanka in the eradication of Dengue by providing Rs.116 million for a joint research programme with Monash University.
The Monash University research team will trial the introduction of a naturally occurring Wolbachia bacteria to the Sri Lankan mosquito populations which will hopefully prevent the dengue virus from being transmitted to humans. The bacteria was said to have the ability to block other mosquito borne diseases such as Zika and Chikungunya.
Addressing the media in Colombo last evening Bishop said the use of the bacteria had been successful in several other countries that it has been piloted in including Brazil, Colombia, Vietnam, India and some pacific nations. ?We know the virus has taken a heavy toll in Sri Lanka with close to a 100,000 infected and 250 deaths and we are committed to helping Sri Lanka eradicate dengue once and for all,? Bishop said.
Speaking of short term measures to eradicate the disease, Bishop said the Australian government would also provide a grant of Rs.58 million to the World Health Organization (WHO) to immediately implement intensive dengue prevention and control measures.
Working with Sri Lankan health authorities and other partners, the objective will be to the reduce transmission of dengue and thereby the incidence by more than 50 per cent over a period of 4-6 weeks in high risk districts of the country. Thanking Bishop, on the initiatives by the Australian government, Health Minister Rajitha Senarathna said the Health Ministry had already developed a sustainable dengue prevention campaign which would ensure the fever would not be a health issue by 2020.
The Minister concluded that this assistance was welcome and would help in eradicating dengue in the country. ?We have exchanged a letter of intent in participating in the programme and will sign the agreement once discussions are concluded,? he said. (Nabeela Hussain)

Bank of England opens up payments systems to spur fintech
	
REUTERS: The Bank of England has widened access to Britain?s interbank payments system to increase competition from new fintech firms in the financial system, where the ?Big Four? high street banks have long dominated.
The BoE flagged the plans in May and published a detailed framework yesterday to make this happen as more and more people use their phone to pay a bill or shuffle money between countries.
It allows new payments firms like those offering prepaid cash cards and prepaid online and mobile accounts, to have access to its ?real time gross settlement? or RTGS payments system. Remittance firms, which allow people to send money overseas, and foreign exchange services are also included.
?This should support financial stability through greater diversity and risk-reducing payment technologies,? BoE Governor Mark Carney said in a statement.
The changes, which in practice will come into effect in 2018 once legislative changes have been completed, will enable such non-bank payments services providers (PSPs) to compete better with banks, the BoE said.
Currently, PSPs negotiate the use payments systems such as CHAPS, owned by big banks like HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds and RBS.
Reduced dependence on bank competitors for access to payment systems will allow the non-bank providers to offer a wider range of payments services, the BoE said. Updated European Union payments rules will also make it easier for PSPs from January next year to compete with banks, such as by accessing data of account holders.
Over 50 banks and building societies in have settlement accounts with the BoE?s RTGS system.

CEB protests over alleged attack on employee
	
Power failures have been reported in Sri Jayawardenepura and the surrounding areas today due to a protest launched by the CEB trade union employees demanding the arrest of the suspect who allegedly assaulted a CEB employee in Ambatale, Mulleriyawa on Wednesday.
CEB sources said power interruptions were reported in Avissawella, Homagama, Horana, Malabe and Jayewardenepura for several hours causing inconvenience to the public as the technical teams had not attended the complaints.
Ceylon Electricity Employees? Union Convener Ranjan Jayalal said an employee attached to the Mulleriyawa CEB power interruption centre had been assaulted by a suspect when the CEB worker went to disconnect the power in a tyre shop owned by the suspect.
According to the CEB divisional sources the employer who was admitted to the Mulleriyawa Base Hospital had later received threatening phone calls asking him to discharge from hospital and to maintain a low profile.
However, the CEB trade union members staged protests yesterday and day before seeking justice to its employee and said they would launch an indefinite countrywide strike if the police failed to enforce the law against those responsible.
Mr. Jayalal told the Daily Mirror that it appeared the law enforcing authorities were hesitating to arrest the responsible person due to political influences.
When contacted, Police Media Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said he was not aware of the matter. The Media Division also confirmed that they had not received of information about such an assault by the Mulleriyawa Police Station.
Meanwhile, the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry had called for discussion with the trade unions to discuss the matter , however the talks was not concluded until the edition went to print.
Mr. Jayalal said that they would take a final decision over the matter following the discussion. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Company building world's 5th tallest building on shaky grounds?
	
Al Aman Group?s World Capital Centre (WCC), which gained notoriety this month for its questionable corporate information after entering into a US $ 2.4 billion Board of Investment (BOI) project, failed to establish its bona fides yesterday at a media conference.
State media this month exposed the firm for publishing suspicious credentials, corporate information and architectural plans on its website.
?I can understand. Yeah, if it is wrong, I have to admit. That?s why now we have downed the websites,? WCC Deputy Chairman Dr. Senaka De Silva said, but then added ?we have not lied?.
The company website is currently offline for ?maintenance?.
Dr. De Silva also admitted commenting to the media that the project was worth US $ 1.2 billion, although he said that this was due to him speaking offhand while he was driving.
While offering journalists a look at its brochure for what WCC claims will be the fifth tallest building in the world, the company in addition could only furnish its certificate of incorporation and the BOI agreement.
Dr. De Silva claimed that while the firm has proper book keeping and documentation, they were not available at that time, despite the conference being held at the firm?s head office.
The company officials presented a broken front when attempting to explain where its parent company was from.
WCC Attorney S.P. Sriskantha and WCC Senior Deputy Chairman Vivek Anandarajah insisted that WCC?s parent, Al Aman Group, was a foreign company, and that they had no clue about any other details of the company.
?Al Aman is registered in Sri Lanka,? Dr. De Silva said later, puzzling those in attendance.
WCC?s claims of having an international reputation and footprints in the UK, Malaysia, Dubai and the Maldives were also brought to question, when Dr. De Silva admitted that while the firm has companies set up in these countries, none had started any operations.
?You can?t say that we have done nothing,? he retorted to a question, but later added, ?We haven?t started yet. No project?.
Anandarajah said that it is the prerogative of a company to start its businesses when the time is ideal and that WCC is waiting for such time.
However, he said that many international financial institutions are showing interest in funding WCC?s first property in Sri Lanka, even though one financial institute has already pledged to fund the full US $ 2.4 billion. He said that WCC will look to diversify its funding.
?And also the staggered funding for five years, we will go with more than one funder for specific reasons to cut down the costs. All are from abroad and they?re from many different countries, the USA, Switzerland. This company is globally known and that is how these international investors have agreed to fund,? he said.
While earlier stating that all funding for WCC will come from foreign sources, who will be issued shares in WCC once the project is complete, Dr. De Silva later said that anyone, including the journalists could invest in the project and that investments could take place in rupees.
Sriskantha said that the latter was allowed under the BOI contract.
Despite numerous attempts to get WCC to furnish its funding sources, the officials remained secretive.
?These are information that we don?t have to disclose. This is our confidential information. This is our business enterprise. As I said previously, we?re in discussions with other funders as well because they?re coming up with competitive offers,? Anandarajah said.
He asked the journalists to ask questions relevant to WCC?s Colombo property development, instead of asking about WCC?s past or about its management, which are irrelevant information.
?We are talking about WCC in Colombo, so let?s concentrate on that,? he said.
The project is proposed to have 117 floors, 1,200 residential units, 3,000 retail outlets, 2,000 hotel rooms in a ?seven-star? hotel with gold-plated presidential suites, the country?s first Michelin-starred restaurant and 20 swimming pools, to name a few of its many features.
Anandarajah said that WCC will construct the entire project even if one pre-sale is not made, since the building will be fully funded prior to construction.
According to the BOI agreement, WCC has to bring in US $ 200 million in funding before end-December 2017. Anandarajah said that drawings for the project are currently being done and that funds will be brought about two months prior to starting construction.
However, he said that the firm has yet to finalize a land to construct the project, among three shortlisted properties.
WCC Director Dr. Arosha Fernando said that WCC will take advantage of the proposed Kra Canal in Thailand, which will make Sri Lanka the hub in South Asia, and that the WCC project is developed under this and the government?s Megapolis project.
?The Port City will be completed in 2041. This is scheduled to be completed in 2023, so we have one up on the Port City. And this way we attract all the top business enterprises, financial centres, airlines, you name it, to this centre, which will have all the modern facilities which are required for a business,? he said.

Deepening a longstanding friendship
	
Seventy years ago, Australia?s first Commissioner to Ceylon, Charles Frost, arrived in Colombo. A year later, Ceylon chose Australia as home to its fourth diplomatic mission, signifying the importance Sri Lanka?s founding leaders placed on our relationship. ??
As neighbours across the Indian Ocean, Australia and Sri Lanka have become close partners with shared strategic and economic interests. ??
My visit to Colombo this week will further strengthen Australia?s security, economic and development partnership with Sri Lanka, building on the landmark visits to Australia by President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe earlier this year. ??
Our relationship is founded on close social and cultural bonds. ??
Australia?s large and vibrant Sri Lankan community has made a significant contribution across all sectors of our society ? business, law, science, medicine, education, media, culture and sport. Many of our 170,000 Sri Lankan Australians are drawing on their Australian experiences to make a contribution to Sri Lanka?s development. ??
Reflecting on the long-standing diplomatic mission between Australia and Sri Lanka which began 70 years ago
Over 7,600 Sri Lankans are currently studying in Australia. This brings to around 30,000 the number of Sri Lankans that have studied in Australia since 1951, including 1,000 on Australian Government scholarships. ??
The cultural exchange works both ways. Last year, 75,000 Australians visited Sri Lanka to experience its beauty and diversity. By the end of this year, over 300 young Australians will have studied or interned in Sri Lanka under the Australian Government?s New Colombo Plan, building connections in fields such as health, biological science, architecture, information technology, agricultural and environment studies, commerce and law. ??
We share a great love of cricket ? and a long and healthy rivalry. Australians recall the Australian team?s defeat in last year?s Test Series in Sri Lanka. ??
Our values are closely aligned. ??
We share a belief in the rule of law and a firm commitment to democracy. We share a commitment to a rules-based international order and ambitions for stronger regional relationships in the Indian Ocean. ??
As maritime trading nations, we work closely to foster security and prosperity in the region we both call home. ??
Our ongoing collaboration to combat people smuggling has greatly diminished this unconscionable criminal trade ? saving many lives that would otherwise have been lost at sea. ??
Australia has long supported Sri Lanka?s future as a prosperous and harmonious nation. ??
We see opportunity to expand our economic relationship, particularly in agribusiness, mining, skills, tourism and energy. We are exploring the possibility of an Economic Framework Agreement to expand bilateral trade and investment. ??
We are deepening our partnership in a number of new areas ? including science, innovation, resources and energy. ??
The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation will collaborate with Sri Lankan researchers to address the prevalence of Chronic Kidney Disease in Sri Lanka, which has affected so many lives. ??
Our national geological agency, Geoscience Australia, will collaborate with Sri Lankan experts to map Sri Lanka?s minerals, helping develop a sustainable resources sector to deliver economic growth and jobs for all Sri Lankans. ??
Australia has provided around $250 million toward post-conflict reconstruction and rehabilitation since the end of Sri Lanka?s civil war in 2009.We continue to be a constructive supporter of Sri Lanka?s ongoing reconciliation efforts, as we understand successful implementation is critical to Sri Lanka?s long-term security and prosperity. ??
Our development assistance focuses on building skills, helping small businesses, supporting economic reform and boosting women?s workforce participation. Together, we are working to ensure opportunities are shared as broadly as possible. ??
This is a time of great hope and opportunity for Sri Lanka and for the deepening friendship between our two countries. ??

?2009 EIA of Uma Oya foresaw possible groundwater drawdown?
	
The experts? panel that compiled the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in 2009 for the Uma Oya Multipurpose Development Project (UOMDP) today stressed that the EIA had clearly indicated the possibility of a draw down of groundwater through weaker zones into the tunnel, affecting domestic and irrigation activities in the surrounding.
Appearing before the media after seven years amidst allegations levelled on the EIA team, the experts yesterday rejected all allegations and stated that the EIA process had gone through the standard procedure.
The panel of experts headed by Senior Professor in Zoology of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura Ms. Swarna Piyasiri and Senior Professor in Engineering of University of Peradeniya K.D.W.Nandalal comprised 19 consultants including a hydro geologist, tunnel engineer, soil scientist, water quality expert, archaeologist, irrigation engineer, fauna and flora geologists, agronomist, infrastructure engineer, resettlement expert and an electrical engineer.
Senior Professor Swarna Piyasiri said the EIA team had recommended to the Central Environment Authority (CEA) to continuously monitor groundwater level fluctuations in the area around tunnel trace, especially along major fracture zones connected to the tunnel, during construction and operational stages.
?The EIA had identified and expected possible lowering of water table during the construction phase with the geological structural maps available by that time. In such instances, sealing of water leaks through proper grouting is necessary prior to further drilling of the tunnel,? she said.
Responding to questions as to who should take responsibility for the environmental, social and geological problems occurred in the project surrounding, Prof. Piyasiri emphasized that the responsibility lay on the EIA team only in planning and compiling the EIA which was issued in three volumes.
?With the approval of the UOMDP by the CEA, the implementation phase of the project commenced for which the involvement of the EIA team is beyond the purview according to the CEA?s terms. As per the terms, monitoring of the project?s activities is not mandatory for the EIA team,? she said.
She further said that the conditional approval letter of the CEA stated that the safety and emergency measures as well as monitoring plan of the project has to be followed by the Ministry of irrigation and Water Resources Management.
Senior Professor K.D.W.Nandalal stated that in any tunnel construction of underground mining operation, issues with the groundwater of the tunnel area can happen.
He said after grouting of fracture zones, groundwater flow towards tunnel area will gradually slow down with the rainfall and rise of water table could also be expected with the time.
?After proper lining and grouting, aquifer may recover but needs some time after the construction. This is a usual phenomenon,? he remarked. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Govt. will lose two thirds majority in 2 weeks- JO
	
Joint Opposition National Organizer and MP Dullas Alahapperuma today requested the UPFA and SLFP ministers in the government to withdraw from their portfolios as this is a UNP regime, while claiming that government will lose its two third majority of the parliament within two weeks.
he told a news conference that the government had lost its focus as to how it should tackle the shortcomings and issues prevailing currently in the country.
"It is useless to hold a portfolio in the government. It is full of chaos. That?s why we invite our dear SLFP and UPFA ministers to leave the scene and join us. But I don?t intend that they all should join hands with us; if anybody wishes to link with us, they are mostly welcome," he said.
Moreover, he discovered that this government deliberately postpones the provincial council elections as they know for sure that they will lose the election.
He further dismissed that Polonnaruwa District UPFA MP Roshan Ranasinghe withdrew from JO politics.
"It is categorically mentioned in the statement made by him that he had not terminated from JO politics or left the JO. Therefore don?t misinterpret it, "he insisted.
Meanwhile, Joint Opposition leader Dinesh Gunawardena said this government was attempting to establish a federal system of government while demolishing the unity government.
He went on to say that rumours spreading with regard to the split of Joint Opposition were false and the media should not publish them in big letters.
"Although there are confrontations within the parties affiliated to JO, we have no idea in separating the unity of the party," he added. (Sheain Fernendopulle)

Living with natural hazards
	
?
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe last week directed officials to experiment with the building of small double storey houses in areas which are prone to natural disasters like floods. The Prime Minister made this observation at a meeting conducted to assess the progress made in flood affected areas in Galle District. In this backdrop, architect Anuka Wettasinghe has come up with the novel idea to build double storey houses in flood?prone areas. ?
?
? As a result of natural hazards such as floods, earth slips and cyclones people are prone to face such hazards. They group together to rescue the victims from such hazards and find solutions. In spite of the fact that a majority of people forget bad effects of such calamities within a very short period of time, it?s ironic that the attention that should pay to minimize those hazards is at a very low ebb. It?s important for rescuing, preventing and the reduction of the imminent disasters. ?
It helps to minimize the damage that can be caused to the human lives and properties during a disastrous situation if the buildings are constructed with a proper plan. Due to the negligence and the ignorance of the people and the shortcomings in decision making by the institutions, the concept called ?hazard resilient buildings , can?t be implemented properly. Therefore, it?s important to focus attention on two building models based on the relief assured for the changing land. ?
?
Take precautionary measures to minimize the disasters that may happen in the future by understating the above models.?
?
1. Buildings constructed on flat lands which are subjected to floods and heavy winds- ?
Suitability and risk situation: When selecting a land for the construction of buildings, it?s necessary to check whether there is approval for constructions and what type of construction can take place. On many occasions, the low lands filled with earth either paddy fields, waterways and drainage systems are sold and construction of buildings takes place. The main reason for floods is the filling of low and waterlogged lands.
It is essential to get the approval of the Low Land Reclamation and Development Board for such constructions. As with lands in the coastal areas, the relevant approval has to be obtained from the Coast Conservation Department. You can obtain information regarding the suitability and limitations regarding the land that is going to be bought by you from the above institutions. ?
?
?
It?s important to follow the following facts after taking a decision to construct a building. ??
In this regard, you have to inspect the area which is affected by the floods and take a decision regarding the height of the flood. You can decide on the ground floor level to protect it from a flood by doing so. ?
See model 1.A
The open Ground floor: The building should be constructed on concrete columns, so that the water should flow without a barrier during a flood situation. The damage which may be caused to the columns due to the floating debris will be minimized due to the circular shape of the columns. As mentioned in the 1B model , the ground floor can be used as a parking space and a living area . The model 1A. can be used for construction with a reservation area in the coastal areas which are prone to tsunami disasters. ??
The high structure/ attic: In the case of an emergency, the wooden structure which is at the lintel level can be used to protect goods from water. ?
Roof: The roof should be made with a slope more than ?25 degrees; more the slope the stronger its ability to withstand winds. Every roofing sheet should be fixed to the? reepers? with ?J? shaped bolt nuts. Wall plates should be connected with the wires of the beam. Concrete lintel with sufficient gaps( 6x6 ft.) is recommended. In the case of a roof thatched with local tiles, it?s important to put mortar restraining bands. The slope of the above mentioned roof together with the strong anchoring process, prevents the roof from being blown away by ?heavy winds, specially in the northern, north eastern and eastern provinces. ??
?
Let us be informed to get rid of hazards ?in spite of the fact that we are compelled to live with disasters. Let us get ready by adhering to?the instructions. ??
?
Garden/ open space: The maximum area for construction is 1/3 of the land. In the balance open space, minimizing the paving of interlocks helps keep the land without being waterlogged. This is managed by covering the land with grass or gravel to absorb water. ?
Solar panel:?A small scale solar panel, which can be carried by hand with 2 bulbs and USB charger, is available for sale in the market. It helps to get rid of inconvenience caused due to interruption of electricity. ?
2. The buildings constructed on the hilly areas which are vulnerable to landslides. ?
The extent of disaster: It?s important to find out whether the land where constructions are to take place is situated in an area prone to landslides. The maps indicating potential landslides have been prepared by National Building Research Organization ( N.B.R.O) by studying the vulnerable areas for landslides at the district and Divisional secretary office levels. Anyone can obtain such information from the Disaster Management Units from the above offices. When constructions are made in the hilly areas, it?s necessary to follow the guidelines of the National Building Research Organization in order to obtain the relevant approval. It?s suitable to construct buildings on lands which aren?t categorized as disaster-prone areas by the National Building Research Organization.
?The angle of the hill : If the angle of the hill is more than 30 degrees from the earth , it isn?t suitable for the construction of ?buildings. If the angle is less than that of the earth, it?s suitable for construction. And if it remains between 30 and 5 degrees, construction can be done according to an approved engineering processes. ??
It?s important to follow the following facts after taking the decision to construct a building. ??
See model 2
Drainage system : Constructions to be made without blocking the natural waterways. Surface water is sent out through the drains to the natural water ways. This is done using a covering with a concrete layer to minimize the absorption of water. This supports the sending of water out through a drain without sending it over the slope. This also serves as an interception drain which prevents the surface water flowing over the ground. ?
Building orientation: The length of the building has to be planned parallel to the contour lines. ?Foundation: Keeping a substantial length between the foundation and the slope (The instructions of the N.B.R.O have to be followed in this regard) ??
Not keeping the foundation or other excavations open for a long time which will stop the collecting of water. ?
Planning the ground floor in the shape of a flat, so that the angle of the ground can be maintained with the least barriers to the foundation of the building. ? Building of foundation columns by digging deep into the build site adds strength (the foundation has to be laid with the instruction of the engineers) ?
For the strength of the building structure, deploy a structural plan with structure, concrete columns and beams. ?
Connecting each of the columns with tie beams at the ground floor level of the building and sill level. ?
Connecting columns with angular concrete beams over the gabel walls . ?
Connecting the structure by the door with steel straps and the windows to the wall. ?
Roof : Fixing the roof with reepers, wall plates and lintels connecting the beam well. ?
Take precautionary measures to minimize the disasters that may happen in the future by understating the above models. Keep these instructions in mind if you hope to construct a new building, repair or renovatr a building. You can minimize or prevent the damages that may be caused to your life?
and properties. ?
You may think that the cost involved in this method may be high. But when you consider the damage and the calamity caused by disaster, this method may be a better idea. Get advice from professionals and institutions regarding problems that arise in this connection. Specially you can obtain the advice from National Building Research Organization in this regard. ??
There may be loopholes in the implementation of the existing laws as well as in the conveying of the processes of the models with regard to the general public. Therefore, they have to be corrected by the responsible institutions. However, it?s important to focus our attention on correct procedures because it?s we who have to face disasters. ?
Let us be informed to get rid of hazards ?in spite of the fact that we are compelled to live with disasters. Let us get ready by adhering to?the instructions.

MFSAC Convener's arrest attempt fails: Police blames distractions caused by students
	
The commotion that was created when a group of police officers, some in uniform and others in civvies, attempted to arrest Medical Faculty Students' Action Committee (MFSAC) Convener Ryan Jayalath at the conclusion of a joint meeting by the Government Medical Officers? Association (GMOA) and several other organisations to protest against the SAITM, ended in failure.
It was reported that Jayalath along with several other MFSAC representatives had attended a discussion organised by the ?SAITM Virodi Jana Paura?, a recently formed anti-SAITM force at the GMOA office located at the OPA (Organisation of Professional Associations in Sri Lanka) building on Prof. Stanley Wijesundera Mawatha, Colombo 7.
The initial attempt to arrest Jayalath by a group of persons had met with failure due to protests from the crowd that had gathered at the venue. Subsequently, the Colombo Crime Division (CCD) with the help of the police, who arrived at the scene without an arrest warrant had attempted to take away the student however the attempt failed because those present at the venue intervened to stop it.
A tense situation arose when National Trade Union Centre (NTUC) Chairman K. D. Lal Kantha and the General Secretary of the Ceylon Teachers' Services Union Mahinda Jayasinghe attempted to prevent the police from taking Jayalath into custody. As a result the law enforcement officers were forced to leave the premises in a ?white van? without taking the MFSAC Convener into custody.
After the police left a student who pretended that he was Jayalath, had got into Lal Kantha?s vehicle to mislead the police personnel. However the actual Jayalath was seen escaping along with the crowd that had gathered.
When contacted, Colombo DIG Lalith Pathinayake told Daily Mirror that they believed the students had created a commotion to help Jayalath escape arrest.
He said Ryan Jayalath has four arrest warrants against him for evading the courts and he was also wanted for breaking and entering into the Health Ministry building. Therefore, DIG Pathinayake said it was not necessary to have an arrest warrant as the police already have the power to arrest him on sight.
Meanwhile, the Medical Faculty Students' Union, University of Sri Jayewardenepura also commenced an anti-SAITM rally to be held today over the government?s alleged attempt to suppress student union conveners. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

New Inland Revenue Act to please IMF: JVP
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today charged that the government had presented a new Inland Revenue Act in parliament for approval to please the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a condition laid down by it to grant the third installment of the IMF loan.
JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said no responsible authorities such as Inland Revenue Department officials, Trade Unions, tax payers and auditing firms had been consulted before formulating the Act.
He told a news conference that the government had proposed so many tax revisions in the Act going beyond the tax revisions made in the budget.
He said tax imposed on agriculture, EPF, lottery victories, grants by the President and scholarship for university students had been increased in the new Act while tax concessions given for stage drama, musical field, new inventions and life insurance policies of senior citizens had been removed.
?The 50% tax concession given to stage dramatists and authors for their first publication of a book had been removed. Inventors engaged in new inventions and life insurance income at maturity for senior citizens had been subjected to income tax. Tax on agricultural equipment had been increased from 10 % to 14 % while tax on medium scale companies had been increased from 10 % to 14 %. Income tax on lottery victories had been increased from 10% to 14%,? he said.
Mr. Dissanayake said services provided by locals for foreign institutions while in Sri Lanka or abroad had been subjected to tax while foreigners providing such services to Sri Lankan institutions had been exempted from tax. (Ajith Siriwardana)

New med. association: a futile attempt by Rajitha - GMOA
	
Despite unlimited political sponsorships, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne was able to gather only a mere 45 members to the newly-formed medical association, the Government Medical Officers? Association (GMOA) said today.
GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said among 18,000 doctors serving the government service, the minister was only able to recruit only a handful of those who were removed from the GMOA.
?Minister Senaratne aimed to destabilise the GMOA that has a rich history of over 90 years. He simply missed the shot. The Health Minister?s political hypocrisy is now exposed to the public. The minister should have understood by now that the GMOA is a challenge to his political career. He will never be able to challenge the GMOA,? Dr. Aluthge said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

?I signed the Office of Missing Persons Act today. This marks another step forward in Sri Lanka's path to sustained peace,? the President tweeted.
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake at a news conference today said the President had signed the Act earlier in the day and that the Chairman of the Office would be chosen from the recommendations made by the Constitutional Council.
?The Office of Missing Persons will not only look at the civil war but also the periods of JVP insurrection,? he said.
Karunanayake also stated the Office will come under the purview of the President himself and pointed out that it was just a step in the process of transitional justice followed by the government.
?The general impression of the office is that it was set up to take action against the armed forces. This is a very open and independent commission and those in the armed forces who have done nothing wrong have nothing to worry about,? the minister said.
Speaking of reparation, the Minister said a new Bill would be brought before parliament in the near future and that funds for the process had already been allocated.
The reparation process will bring those displaced by the war to their places of origin. ?It is a reconstruction and restoration process,? Minister Karunanayake said.(Nabeela Hussain)

RICHMOND 203 YEARS OF EXCELLENCE
	
?
Richmond College, Galle, a premier educational institution in Sri Lanka with an unparalleled history, completes 203 years of incessant existence on 25th July 2017. Beginning as the ?Galle School? in 1814, it took a little more than six decades before it was renamed ?Richmond?. During her 203-year long journey, she passed several milestones. ??
The native monarchy ended with the British subjugating the entire country in 1815. The first missionaries from England were the Baptists and from the Church of Ireland and with the presence of the Anglican Chaplains they all began to actively propagate their brands of Christianity. In 1813 six of the Missionaries of the Wesleyan Methodist Church, led by the Rev Dr Thomas Coke, set sail to Ceylon accompanied by William Ault, James Lynch, George Erskine, William Martin Harvard, and Thomas Hall Squance, Benjamin Clough and, John Mckenny, destined for Cape of Good Hope. Rev Dr Coke died at sea on the 2nd of May and was committed to the deep the next day. The other missionaries arrived in Bombay and five of them came to the Galle Harbour on 29th June 1814. The governor, General Sir Brownrigg of the country had prior knowledge of their arrival and sent his Brother-in-law the Rev Bisset, the senior Chaplain, to meet and confer with the Missionaries and to learn about their future plans and report to him. General Brownrigg on hearing of their plans suggested that they start schools to teach English to the natives? while engaging in preaching and was promised pecuniary assistance of fifty Rix dollars (the legal currency at the time) for each school they established. The Governor made this suggestion with foresight. He foresaw the need of an educated native workforce if the country was to be developed and progressed. ??
?
A large Dutch built house in Galle was initially taken on rent, but later purchased by Erskine on behalf of the Methodist Mission, and the school was moved to Galle Fort. That building is at present the main hall of Southlands Girls? School
?
The Missionaries held a meeting- the first Wesleyan Methodist ?Conference?- on 4th July 1814 at the Queen?s House Galle, heralding the beginning of the Methodist Mission in the country. And by ballot they decided the stations for the six missionaries. William Ault was selected to labour in Batticaloa, James Lynch and Thomas Hall Squance to occupy Jaffna, George Erskine to Matara, and Benjamin Clough to remain in Galle, and William Martin Harvard, to occupy Colombo upon his arrival. ??
Benjamin Clough was visited by the Maha Mudaliy?r of Galle, Don Abraham Dias Abeysinghe Amarasekera on 25th July 1814, on hearing that Clough was to start a school soon. He offered his deceased brother Balthazar?s vacant house for this purpose. The house was built in 1712 by the Dutch, in upper Dickson Road, Galle, and was known as Doornberg. ??
?
The Missionaries held a meeting- the first Wesleyan Methodist ?Conference?- on 4th July 1814 at the Queen?s House Galle, heralding the beginning of the Methodist Mission in the country
Mission documents record, ?Mr. Clough, after acknowledging the liberal offer of the Mudaliy?r, went to view the premises, which are about a mile from the Fort, and only a stone?s-throw from the house of the generous proprietor. They are situated in a very retired and romantic spot; and appeared in most respects to be so eligible, that Mr. Clough did not hesitate to accept of the liberal proposal. He immediately had his luggage removed; and was thus, without any expense to the Mission Fund, placed at once in a situation of comfort and respectability; and in circumstances of all others the best; calculated to promote his improvement in the language, and his usefulness among the natives. His school was soon commenced, and attended by some of the most intelligent boys on the island.? The date is recorded in the Rev Clough?s journal archived in the library of the School of African-Asian Studies (SOAS), as 25th July 2014. ??
?
Colebrooke observed that the English missionary societies have formed extensive establishments in various parts of Ceylon
?
The school became very popular with more and more natives seeking to study under the Rev Clough. In 1815 Rev William Harvard joined his brethren in Galle. The Rev Erskine had returned to Galle by this time abandoning his school in Matara due to disinterest by the natives though it was opened with much enthusiasm. The Rev Harvard was to soon move to Colombo as planned earlier. ??
The Rev Erskine took over from Clough when he left for Colombo with Rev Harvard. A large Dutch built house in Galle was initially taken on rent, but later purchased by Erskine on behalf of the Methodist Mission, and the school was moved to Galle Fort. That building is at present the main hall of Southlands Girls? School. Although no reason is adduced for the relocation in mission records it could be argued that it was due to societal reasons prevailing at the time. The Mission continued to use Doornberg for many more years and billeted the unmarried missionaries who started arriving in the country. It also served as a temporary abode for missionaries of several other denominations who arrived in Ceylon during the second decade of the nineteenth century. ??
?
?
In 1816, the Rev John Mckenny too arrived in Galle failing to secure permission from the Governor to establish a mission in South Africa and joined Erskine. In 1817, the Rev Mckenny established the first Wesleyan Methodist Vernacular. ??
?
The educational system took another decisive turn in 1865 with the discontinuance of The Central School Commission. The government changed its policy of giving the grant to schools based on their performance, deviating from the earlier policy of allowing grants on predetermined criteria like student population and the number of tutors
?
?
The school in Bone vista, Unawatuna, Galle, which was later abandoned, was taken over by the Anglican Church. It was called the Bone vista School. He then established the second English School of the Galle School in Ja Kotuwa, M?g?lla together with a female department (in later years it went on to become the Rippon Girls? School). It was a vernacular school and a caste based one, made at the request of the natives belonging to that caste living around M?g?lla. He also established the first Anglo-vernacular school in Minuwangoda, Galle and several other schools in the suburbs. All these schools, although on different foundations, was the same Galle School. ??
The Methodist Mission opened more small (Limited capacity) schools in Galle, but the parent School was the Galle School in Fort. The Superintending missionary of Galle supervised the school with locally recruited teachers. It?s said that the all scholars sat together and took instructions, irrespective of caste, creed, ethnicity, religion or social standing. Richmond can take credit for being the pioneer school to eliminate caste, creed, and ethnic rivalries in schools. ??
In 1829, Lieutenant-Colonel William MacBean George Colebrooke and Charles Hay Cameron, in 1830, two Royal Commissioners, came to Ceylon to study and report on administrative, financial, economic, and judicial reforms. They submitted five reports between December 1831 and May 1832, and they became the reports of the ?Commission of Eastern Enquiry. Colebrooke proposed drastic changes to the Civil Service and recommended that the public service should be freely open to all classes of persons according to their qualifications. He also recommended that the government implemented the proposals in 1833. He proposed that the government actively takes part in the role of education. He also proposed the establishment of a School commission to make policy decisions, on education, and supervise all schools in the country to ensure a uniform system of education.
??
Colebrooke observed that the English missionary societies have formed extensive establishments in various parts of Ceylon, and it would be unnecessary to retain the government schools in situations where English instructions may already be afforded. He also proposed to disallow teaching of scripture during school hours and suggested it be taught either before or after the time spent inside the classroom. The School Commission was established in 1834, but soon encountered problems due to inter-denominational rivalries on the teaching of the scripture. The School Commission was discontinued and a new Central School Commission was established in 1841. The first Methodist female School was established by the Rev William Bridgnell in 1842, which is at present known as Southlands Girls? School. Colebrooke wanted the vernacular schools abolished, but the Methodist Mission didn?t agree to the proposition. It was after the Central School Commission in 1841 that vernacular education was encouraged again. ??
The Central School Commission offered a grant to all schools willing to be supervised and conducted according to the commission?s proposals. The commission formed a list of all schools who agreed to the proposition. The Galle Boys? and the Girls? School, giving its consent to get the grant, too was included in the list which was incorrectly interpreted by many as a government takeover. In the history of education in Sri Lanka, the government took over schools only in 1962, and not in any other year. Those schools that became eligible to the grant continued to be supervised by the respective sponsoring societies. ??
The Rev Joseph Rippon, who became the superintending Missionary in 1851, purchased an abandoned mountainous property in Galle known as Mount Seymour or the Sillery?s Hill in 1857. He sought permission to start a High school, an industrial school, an academic institute for females with a farm. His proposal wasn?t sanctioned, but he was asked to move several native schools, the Anglovernacular school operating in Minuwangoda and the female school in Magalle to the hill, to save the rent paid to private properties in conducting the schools. The School in the Hill was then called the Richmond Hill School and the female branch, the Richmond Hill Girl?s Boarding School. ??
The educational system took another decisive turn in 1865 with the discontinuance of The Central School Commission. The government changed its policy of giving the grant to schools based on their performance, deviating from the earlier policy of allowing grants on predetermined criteria like student population and the number of tutors. The schools were subject to government inspection and the grant had to be earned based on performance and the progress made. Schools had to be upgraded from their present status if they were to earn an enhanced grant. Thus, many vernacular schools were upgraded to Anglo-vernacular schools and the Anglo-vernacular schools were converted to high schools. ??
With his health failing, Rev Rippon returned home in 1861. Rev Nicholson came after him and pursued Rev Rippon?s dream of establishing a high school. In 1863 the Society sanctioned to upgrade the Anglo-vernacular school in the hill to a high school and renamed it as Wesley College. Unfortunately due to pressure from the Colombo elite, it was moved out from Richmond Hill, and the Dam Street School was elevated to a high school. This is the present Wesley College. ??
The Rev George Baugh, who was serving in Kandy, returned home in 1873 with his sick wife, who didn?t survive the voyage and died at sea. He remained in England for some time and having remarried, returned in 1874. He too pursued Rev Rippon?s dream of a high School in the hill. With Rev Baugh?s perseverance and commitment it was sanctioned in 1875. The Anglovernacular school in the hill was converted to a collegiate School by connecting the M?g?lla English School. The institute was renamed as Galle High School with the Rev Samuel Langdon at the helm. Six years later, Rev Samuel Hill suggested the institute be renamed Richmond College. ??
Under Langdon the school became popular and made rapid progress. One year after the school was converted to a collegiate school, several Scholars gained entrance to the newly formed Ceylon Medical School in 1877, while several others were successful in sitting for the Calcutta University examination. Langdon served for three years and was transferred to Kandy. ??
From the beginning of Richmond as the Galle School in 1814 until it was converted to a collegiate School in 1876, the Superintending Missionary of Galle administered the school and he served as Principal. ??
Beginning with Rev Benjamin Clough in 1814, as many as 21 Missionaries Superintended the School until it was converted to a collegiate institution in 1876. Rev Samuel Langdon became the first Missionary Principal of the school. The school was vested in the Government in 1962 until which time the school was under the Wesleyan Methodist Mission. During this period there were seventeen Methodist Missionary and three Ceylonese Methodist Principals. The first Buddhist Principal D G Welikala was appointed in 1962. Since then the school has had ten Principals up to the present times. Of all the Principals Richmond had, seven were old boys. Claude Ivor de Silva, who took care of the school until it was taken over, is the oldest living principal now aged 94 years. ??
For a school to exist uninterrupted for 203 years is a great achievement. Being the oldest Wesleyan Methodist School in Sri Lanka and Asia is also a great prestige. ??
Several Richmond Missionary Principals left an indelible mark in the College History. Rev Samuel Langdon is credited with introducing science to schools in Sri Lanka. The Rev James Hone Darrell Memorial Hall of the college, built in 1898 by the Rev Darrell, is an engineering marvel. It has no pillars to support a high tiled roof and has withstood the test of time for more than a century.

In 1876 Rev George Baugh?s unremitting efforts to convert the school in to a high school paid off. It became a High School. For many years, the misinterpretation of the transformation of the Anglo-vernacular school in Richmond Hill to a High school or a collegiate institute was taken as the beginning of the school. The Methodist Church of Sri Lanka recently made a proclamation rectifying the error.

Seven suspects had been arrested by the Mount-Lavinia Police in connection with the detection of cocaine weighing 218kg worth over Rs. 3.2 billion concealed in a sugar container at the Ratmalana Economic Centre yesterday, Police Media Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekera said.
He said 198 packets of Cocaine packed in ten travelling bags were found following a tip received by IGP Pujith Jayasundara.
He said that one travelling bag had been opened when the police arrived at the location and two packets of Cocaine were later found in the possession of two employees attached to the Ratmalana Economic Centre unloading section.
SP Gunasekera said six employees-including the two, who stole the two cocaine packets-and the driver of the container had been taken into custody.
Meanwhile, SP Gunasekera said investigations were still in preliminary stages and therefore the Police are probing the matter to find the country from where the sugar was imported and the importer?s information to trace the network.
The sugar container was reportedly imported by a private importer for Lanka Sathosa. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

SL looking to emulate India - Pothas
	
Looking to emulate the kind of revival that took India from seventh in the ICC Test Rankings to the top in the space of two years, Sri Lanka Interim Coach Nic Pothas yesterday said that changing the culture of the team was essential in riding out the rebuilding phase that it is currently in.
Pothas has been tasked with coaching the team till a permanent appointment is made, following the departure of Graham Ford after the ICC Champions Trophy campaign last month.
?I think we?re probably in the same situation that (the) Indian Team (were) were few years ago. We?re in the rebuilding phase. In that first (Zimbabwe) series it was more about getting to know about the players, but most importantly the words being mentioned already ? the culture, trying to change the culture, ownership, attention to detail, intensity at practice and overall improvement. So, if you use those as your cornerstones, which we will, we?ll certainly see some improvements in a very short period of time,? Pothas said.
Meanwhile, coming off the record chase against Zimbabwe earlier this week, One Day International and Twenty20 International Captain Upul Tharanga said the Sri Lankan Team?s confidence was high and playing the number one team in the world would be a good barometre to measure their development.
?I think Zimbabwe played well throughout the tour and it took a lot of effort to beat them. Chasing that record target in the second innings has really boosted our confidence,? Tharanga said.
?India are the number one ranked team in the world and when you play the number one ranked team, we know, as a team, what we have to do. What we have to look at now is how we can go forward and how we can beat our next opposition. We have to keep the trust the players gave in the team. We beat the number one ranked team (Australia) the last time, and I think playing the (current) number one team is a good opportunity for us to show where we are in our development.?
Kohli identified India?s 2015 Tour of Sri Lanka as a turning point in his team?s assent to the top of the Test Rankings, but despite Sri Lanka being in a rebuilding phase, said that they would not take Sri Lanka lightly.
?We still remember the tour of Australia was in 2014 and 2015 that we found ourselves number seven in the world and from then on the transformation started and I think this particular series in Sri Lanka is what gave us belief after being 0-1 down in the series. The victories were hard fought but what it taught us was to come together and come closer as a team and understand our strengths and weaknesses and define the roles that we play in Test cricket and take the team higher in the rankings and within 12 or 14 months from Australia we were already in the number one side in the world. We just touched it. But from then on we?ve solidified it,? Kohli said.
?But everyone in the team knows and believes that this is where it all started for us. After losing that Test in Galle, a dent for us mentally, and how the team came back from that was iconic. We definitely don?t take any opponent lightly. We pay equal respect to any opposition because you can be a strong and a weak side, but you still have to play the same game. You have to earn your wins. I firmly believe if you want to win a series in any part of the world you have to play good cricket, which we are ready to do,? Kohli said recalling that particular success. (Shehan Daniel)

Will vet SL soldiers similar to other countries: UN
	
The United Nations has said that when selecting soldiers for the UN peacekeeping mission, it would vet Sri Lankan troops similar to soldiers from other countries, to ensure they were not involved in illegal activities in their home country.
In response to a question that the UN was still recruiting Sri Lankan troops to serve (the UN Multi-dimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission) in Mali despite some new findings by the UN that Sri Lanka's security forces were engaged in torture, Deputy Spokesman for the UN Secretary-General told a news briefing in New York ??Well, wherever we recruit soldiers from, in every country, we try to vet the incoming peacekeeping troops, to make sure that they're not involved in any such problems in their home country.?
?And, of course, we will do that sort of vetting for Sri Lankan troops as we do for any other country,? he said.
The spokesman said that UN Under Secretary General for Political Affairs, Jeffrey Feltman, who arrived in Sri Lanka yesterday, would take up the latest allegation against the Sri Lankan security forces, with the Sri Lankan Government. (Sunil Jayasiri)

Woman forced to wait to have womb removed due to power cut
	
A sudden one and a half hour power outage that occurred while doctors at the Wathupitiwala Base Hospital were operating on a forty-five-year old woman to remove her womb meant that the woman was forced to wait for one and half hours with her abdomen open for the operation to be completed.
A gynaecologist, assisted by another doctor, began the operation at about 9.45 yesterday (19) morning. However after the doctors opened up her abdomen the electricity supply to the hospital was disconnected leaving the doctors in a very difficult situation. The generator installed at the hospital in case of an emergency was also found to be defective and of no use.
It was after one and half hours that the electricity supply was restored. The dedicated doctors had stayed by the operation bed looking into the needs of the patient to make sure her condition remained stable.
The operation was successfully completed after the power supply was restored and everything ended well for all concerned.
When asked about what had occurred the Assistant Health Superintendent of the hospital K.Manoharan said that they were able to get the electricity restored after informing their plight to the Ceylon Electricity Board.(?By S. U. W. K. Jayawardena)?
