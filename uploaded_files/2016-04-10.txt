Arresting me would be wild goose chase: John
	
Replying to a query from the media regarding the statements of a group of individuals that Minister John Amaratunga was responsible for the demolition of the Wattala jogging track and that he should be arrested, he said that it would be wild goose chase that would never materialize.
He said the land belonged to a private company and that they had obtained permission to construct a road. He said he was not aware who demolished the jogging track but the company was reconstructing it.
When the journalists mentioned about the statement of a group of parliamentarians that he should be arrested in connection with the incident he gave a sarcastic reply that it would be wild goose chase and that their foolhardiness should be ignored. (Kanchna Kumara Ariyadasa)

Centre firm on bridge across Palk Strait connecting SL
	
Indian BJP-led NDA government at the Centre was firm in its proposal to build a bridge across Palk Strait, connecting Dhanushkodi, the eastern tip of Rameswaram Island and Talaimannar in Sri Lanka, Union Minister of State for Road Transport, Highways and Shipping Pon Radhakrishnan said.
Talking to reporters in Ramanathapuram on Saturday, he said the project was at the preliminary stage but the government was firm in going ahead with the project and realise the dream of Mahakavi Bharathi. The Sri Lankan government is expected to give its nod for the project, Mr. Radhakrishnan said, replying to a question.
Once the project was executed, Danushkodi, which became a ghost town after the 1964 cyclonic storm, would flourish and the extension of a four-lane highway from Paramakudi to Rameswaram would be automatically implemented, he said.
After the execution of the project, this arid and backward district, which earned the dubious distinction of ?Thanni illa kaadu? (waterless jungle) and choicest destination for punishment postings would turn into one of the wealthiest districts in the country, he said.
Rejecting a suggestion that the Centre was delaying the construction of a memorial for the former President, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam at the burial site at Pei Karumbu, near here, he said the Centre had just received clearance from the State government and the memorial would emerge as one of the best in the country.
Replying to a question, Mr. Radhakrishnan said the NDA after coming to power at the Centre in May 2014, had secured the release of fishermen, whenever they were arrested by the Sri Lankan navy on charges of poaching. The External Affairs Ministry was taking steps to work out a lasting solution to the vexatious issue, he said. The question of retrieving Katchatheevu would be decided if the islet came in the way of working out a lasting solution to the fishermen issue, he said, answering a question.(The Hindu)

Financial transactions in a mobile age
	
The concept of electronic cash (e-cash) has become very popular in today?s context, due to the rising adoption of advanced mobile devices such as smartphones and the extensive use of the Internet. We see that the most commonform of money used when transacting in the modern business world, is electronic cash. Users have the ability to conduct a wide range of financial services without having to handle physical cash or cheques and banks facilitate the process by providing digital services. The most significant benefit of using e-cash is the ease and convenience of accessing cash and carrying out transactions anytime, anywhere, thus saving up on the most ?important elementat our?
disposal, time.
This concept of electronic money is not entirely new and has been around for at least a decade. Debit cards and online bill payments for example enable users to immediately transfer funds from personal accounts to business accounts irrespective of the country of origin, with just a few clicks and without any physical transfer of money. While many businesses rush to offer digital money products, e-cash allows users to conduct all forms of Internet transactions.
With the help of modern technology, e-cash is changing the way currency is perceived. Eventhough the change seems revolutionary, it is actually only an evolution from current paper-based mediums. In the modern financial markets, electronic money is a necessary invention. Merchants alsocan attract customers to their online market place by utilising e-cash systems as a selling tool.?
With over 10 billion mobile Internet devices expected to be in use by the end of 2016 and a world population of 7.3 billion people, it is clear that mobile phones are now a basic necessity. Further, the rise in the use of smartphones has established a flourishing market for mobile applications, helping businesses to increase productivity by restyling end-user experiences and more effectively mobilising their workforces.
With Western countries embracing these fast-paced mobile phone applications to uplift their daily living standards, one can only hope that these technologies would be adopted by Sri Lanka in the near future. We look forward to a daywhen we will be able to head to work in the morning with nothing more than a smartphone in our pocket and be to able to pay for anything, anywhere, be it even a?
cab or breakfast.?
Life gets easier every day with the booming mobile app industry and daily transactions can now be done using nothing more than an app on a smartphone or tab. The hassle of phone calls, cash, credit cards, online forms, loyalty cards or even an ID card is limited. Thus, adopting such technologies will no doubt be a major factor in advancing financial inclusion and one of the driving forces of economic growth in the country.

Mahinda commends PM?s China visit
	
Former president and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa today commended the official visit undertaken by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to China.
Addressing a gathering at Angunukolapelassa, he said it was essential to maintain good relationships with neighboring countries.
He said the government members continued to blame the previous government for its development projects started with Chinese funds, but today it had turned towards China.
"Not only did they speak against China funded projects but they also halted work on them once they came to power. If they continued with the envelopment projects, the country could have had more extensive expressway network today," he said.
Mr. Rajapaksa said it was not advisable to halt the development projects because it would devalue the project.
He said that he hoped the government and its leaders would not take revenge on their political opponents any longer in the spirit of the NewYear.

No action, talk only: Swaminathan on NPC
	
Northern Provincial Council has become a ?no action - talk only? scenario depriving the legitimate basic needs of the Tamil Community which elected the provincial political authoritiesto address the pressing requirement, Minister of of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs D. M Swaminathan said in a statement. ?
Responding to Northern Province Chief Minister C. V Vigneswaran?s letter informing him of the Provincial Councils decision to reject a project to construct 65,000 houses, the Minister wrote that funds provided by the Central Government for the development of the Northern Province was not being spent despite the fact that there was a serious need for development in the Province for housing, livelihood, infrastructure, agriculture, fisheries and industrial economic activities.? ?
Full Statement
Hon.C.V. Vigneswaran , Chief Minister of Northern Provincial Council has sent a letter to Hon. D.M. Swaminathan, Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs informing? that the Northern Provincial Council unanimously decided to totally reject? the 65,000 housing programe. In his letter he further emphasized that the Government?s agenda for moving this project is to show Geneva and not for the Tamil community.Hon.C.V.Vigneswaran, Chief Minister presenting the a resolution to the constitutional reforms to the Northern Provincial Council has proposed to set up two states in the country, one by merging the Northern and Eastern provincial councils and other by merging the seven provinces.
With regard to the 65,000 housing programme,? the Leader of the opposition of the Northern Provincial Council said that it is not a unanimous decision to stop the project but to include modifications wherever necessary. This is being done at present through model houses and the modifications are already been incorporated.
Hon. D.M. Swaminathan , Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs responding to the allegation said that the northern Provincial has not done anything substantially since the end of conflict in 2009. It is reported the money provided by the Central Government for the development of the Northern Province is not being spent despite the fact that there is a serious need for development in the Northern Province for housing, livelihood, infrastructure, agriculture, fisheries and industrial economic activities.
It has become a ?no action - talk only? scenario depriving the legitimate basic needs of the Tamil Community which elected the provincial political authoritiesto address the pressing requirement. Further, whatever Government does, the Northern Provincial Council opposing and bringing an end for all resettlement and development activities. It looks to me that this approach is purely to keep them in their positions without an interest to ?heal the wound?.? It is time for the people to recognize the political ends and personal interest of these politicians. If people fail to express their strong views on this type of personalized agenda, in the long term it can have disastrous consequences.
When the Government has decided to give a fully furnished house with water supply, tube well, electricity, furniture with beds, fans, television, wi-fi facilities, gas cooker with cylinder at a substantial value, the Chief Minister opposes this project and wants to build partially completed house without any facilities to the people who underwent sufferings for over 30 years.
I would request the people who are opposing this housing development programmeto go and see the plight of the people who are in the welfare camps, temporary huts and living with the mercy of friends and relatives. Those who are in the air conditioned houses wants only good houses with all facilities for their family members and children but when it?s come to those who elected them ? their constituencies ? they want to bulldoze them to be in a partially completed house without any basic facilities so that the importance of politicians will be felt indefinitely. The Member of Parliament Mr. Sumanthiran has been criticizing this project one month ago without knowing the basic facts. By his letter he has now only asked the very basis questions for which information will be given.
Every development brought by successive Governments to uplift the economic and social conditions of the Tamil community have been opposed, causing serious damage to the community. These politicians will also not do anything to their own constituencies but will also oppose others who do some good development work. Earlier, the Chief Minister put up his arguments on the cost, acceptability, durability, post construction maintenance and under groundwater. These weak arguments were technically explained and now he is coming with a new agenda that this initiative is Geneva based.
When His Excellency the President and the Prime Minister are keen and taken a lot of interest to resolve these problems and uplift the social conditions of the conflict affected families, the relevant political authorities should make best use of this opportunities. One cannot fool every one every day.

Port City to resume as Spl. Financial and Business Centre
	
The Chinese-funded Colombo Port City project which had been stalled earlier citing environmental and legal irregularities will be resumed as a Special Financial and Business Centre under the Western Mega-City plan, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told reporters in Colombo today.
Briefing his recently concluded China visit, the Prime Minister said matters with regard to the environmental impacts, legal circumstances and conveyance of the Port City project have been solved after discussing with the Parliament.
He said an economic value will be added to the Chinese-funded project by appending the project into US$ 30 billion Western Mega-City plan.
?In order to become the economic hub in the Indian Ocean, the Western Mega-City will be our main focus. We have decided to establish the Special Financial and Business Centre in the Port City which was initiated by the Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2014. If we build the Special Financial and Business Centre in Ratmalana or Welikada, it is certain that the Port City project will be futile,? the Prime Minister said.
Speaking on the reports of a US$125 million compensation sought by the China Communications Construction Company (CCCC) which undertook the port city project, due to the stalling of the project, the Prime Minister said no such compensation would be made and they have negotiated with the authorities on the matter.
While stating that the bilateral discussions held with the Chinese Counterpart concluded successfully, the Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said an expected Rs.3000 billion worth competitive economy will be achieved by the Sri Lankan government as an economic pact with India, Free Trade Pacts with China and Singapore, a trade agreement with Japan and the regaining of GSP+ from the European Union (EU) are due to take place before the end of this year.
Adding to that, he said trade pacts with countries like Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, Thailand and an economic pact with South Korea will also be made by the government next year.
?Since 1952, relations between China and Sri Lanka were on governments, departments and institutions level. But, we had discussions with the Chinese businessmen and investors who are keen to expand their business in our country. Hereafter, private investors and businessman can come here and our businessman can go there too,? he stated.
Meanwhile, the Premier said some Chinese companies have made suggestions about the possibility of some infrastructure projects becoming public-private partnerships, in which part of the debt will become equity held by the Chinese companies.
While claiming that the matter is still on discussion level, he said most probably the government will consider making the Hambantota Habour Project which was started by the previous government a public-private partnership.
?We have not yet identified the exact projects which will be sold in stakes to the Chinese companies for equity. We discussed on the principles of it. If they are willing to do that, we will see on next steps. But, we should confirm to the Chinese and Sri Lankan law. When it comes to Hambantota, it is essential. Will see,? he told the reporters.
However, he said the government has already permitted Chinese companies to develop the infrastructure of Hambantota Habour and Mattala Airport.
?Because Sri Lankan companies can?t do this, we handed over the Chinese Companies to uplift the Hambantota Habour and Hambantota Airport. A second phase of the Hambantota Habour will also be constructed. Now they have started bringing ships, airplanes and air services to Hambantota Habour and Hambantota Airport,? the Prime Minister said.
According to him, 1000 acres have been leased for Chinese businessmen for a 99 years lease agreement in Hambantota to establish a new industrial zone in the area.
?We had discussions with President Xi Jinping on how to begin industrialization to our country. In our goal of creating one million jobs, we need to make new industries,? he added.
He also said after President Maithripala Sirisena?s attending to the G7 Summit of the world's largest industrial nations (the UK, Germany, Italy, Canada, USA, France and Japan) in Japan in May, the government will announce the economic ?master plan? for next few years.
All the fields will be covered by the economic ?master plan? and Sri Lankans will be ready to face any economic challenge coming from the world including the impact which could be made if the UK withdraws itself from the EU. (Piyumi Fonseka)
