Alternative PM; We have already proved it: UNP
	
Responding to the statement that have been made by President Maithripala Sirisena that he is willing to appoint an alternative Prime Minister if a member of Parliament proves he has a majority, the UNP yesterday said it cannot think of a new way to show a majority as they have already proved it.
This sentiment was expressed by UNP MP Ajith P Perera at a media briefing last afternoon.
We have shown that we have a majority by approving two no-confidence motions against the new government while we did proved that present Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksha does not have a majority by approving the committee of selection appointed by the Speaker. One hundred and twenty one members voted for it, Mr. Perera said.
Asked whether UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe has a majority in the House, he said Mr Wickremesinghe does have a majority in the House. Few who had become ministers in the new government will also come out and support Mr Wickremesinghe at the right time, he said.
Asked why UNP has not submitted affidavits and prove that Mr. Wickremesinghe has a majority, Mr. Perera said they are willing to do it immediately if President gives an opportunity to do it after meeting him.(Yohan Perera)

Blue Ocean Group, Marches Towards Great Achievements
	
There is a general speculation in the real estate trade that Sri Lanka has no promising future because a very high competition prevails among a large number of construction companies. But Blue Ocean Group had negated this theory with its tremendous success in this trade. The Group had proved beyond any doubt that the demand for condominium apartments in Sri Lanka is on rapid increase and the industry has good prospects in the long run.
People prefer to go for condominiums in consideration of their highest security, low maintenance costs and trouble free life. Many Sri Lankan families are now moving into cities like Colombo for better employments, business and higher educational opportunities for their children. As it is rather difficult and time to find separate houses for such purposes, condominiums become their easiest and quickest solution while saving their money, time and energy.
Commenting on the groups continuous success in the real estate trade, Group Chairman SivarajahThumilan (ACA, ACCA, ACMA (UK), CGMA, CPA (AUS), MCSI (UK), FM AAT (SL) ACS - Chartered Accountant) said,
It is true that there is a high competition in the real estate trade in Sri Lanka but we have achieved tremendous success through our untiring efforts to the extent of conquering many international awards. We dedicate this chain of success to our clients as we take these achievements as the reflection of the unshakable trust they have kept in us. We have established our brand name firmly since our inception by which today we have become the first choice for anyone who thinks about owning an apartment in Sri Lanka.
Our member company Link Engineering is currently handling 35 private, projects and 38 public projects all over the island. Meanwhile, Blue Ocean is doing 35 large projects in 10 cities, targeting 1250 residences at a stretch. For year 2018 alone we handled nearly Rs.55 Billion worth of projects which is supposed to be a historic record for a private construction company.It is the first- ever record in Sri Lankas real estate history for a single group to undertake such a large number of projects, at one stretch.
As another feather to its cap, Blue Ocean Group had set an impressive record of completing the six multiple condominium projects simultaneously. Within the last 3  4 months we have completedover 175 condominium units in De Alwis Avenue, Mount Lavinia, Barnes Avenue, Mount Lavinia, Lillan Avenue, Mount Lavinia, Beach Road, Mount Lavinia, De Alwis Place, Dehiwala, Inner Flower Road, Colombo 03, Gregorys Road, Colombo 07. In addition, another 125 Condo Units to be completed within the next 2 months.
There are many reasons behind this situation. Firstly, we give high importance to the locations we select for our complexes. We give maximum focus on a trouble free,decent, secure, hygienic and uncongested environment suitable for a peaceful living. Our general idea is to create an atmosphere for the residents that they are far away from the dusty, noisy and disturbing city life.
Also, to suit the customers financial capacity we have taken an additional step to classify our apartments into three categories  First Class, Business Class and Economy Class and carry out our construction works with a highly qualified team and using high quality materials.
With our experience, technical expertise and manpower we provide a constructive customer service with our own team of professionals, comprising 05 Chartered Architects, 08 Chartered Engineers, 04 Chartered Accountants, 42 Civil Engineers, 25 MEP Engineers, 58 Quantity Surveyors and 335 Staff of other professions in the Construction trade.
Our Group is now technically further strengthened with the joining of M.R. Jeyachandran (MPM(Aus) ,MBA(Aus) ,PG.Dip(B&F.Mgt), B.Sc(Hons), C.Eng.MIE(SL) as the new Chief Executive Officer. Being the former Director General of the Buildings Department and former Chairman of C.I.D.A, Jeyachandran is a highly experienced and successful team leader. His wide experience in the construction related field will be of a definite advantage to our Group.
The Groups consistent year on year improvement in financial results is a clear indication of the financial sustainability of our business model. To ensure the sustainability of the social and environmental aspects associated with our business, we continue to embrace best practices for social and environmental management. From a social perspective, our infrastructure projects across the country have a significant bearing on the communities in the area and has improved the standard of living of our stakeholders. Our work to empower these communities has made Blue Ocean Group a brand name and an exemplary corporate citizen of Sri Lanka.

Clash between two students claims a life
	
A school prefect studying for his A/Ls in the Maths Stream who got into a fight with a Grade 9 student after the latter took umbrage at being disciplined by a senior, succumbed to his injuries yesterday while undergoing treatment in the intensive care unit of the Kalutara Nagoda Hospital for a head injury.
The incident occurred last Wednesday (21) at a leading school in Dinagoda Beruwala, according to the police.
The deceased has been identified as Mohamed Thariq (17), while the suspect was a 15-year-old student of the same school, who was subsequently taken in for questioning following the death of the former.
The dispute between the two students had arisen because of the younger boy ignoring the bell rung by the school prefect to get everyone to be silent in class. This triggered an argument which ended with the prefect being pushed backwards by the grade 9 student causing him to fall and hit his head on the floor.
After going back to his own class, Thariq had told his teacher that he was not feeling well and was sent home after receiving some pain-killers as he had complained that his head was hurting.
Thariq had told his parents that he was not hungry and only wanted to sleep when he got home. However, the next day too the young man had complained of not being well and this worried his parents who got him admitted to the Beruwala hospital but was transferred to the Nagoda hospital as his condition had become worse. Because his condition was critical the authorities had rushed him to the Colombo National Hospital where he underwent a surgery before being transferred back to the Nagoda hospital on Friday (25). He breathed his last at this hospital two day later.
According to a hospital spokesman Thariq had suffered a brain injury after his head hit the floor during the tussle with the other student.
Kalutara Additional Magistrate Vajira Lakshman held a preliminary inquest into the death. Investigations into the case were continuing under the guidance of Kalutara SP Upul Nilmini Ariyadasa.(Indika Ramanayaka)

Ahead of another parliamentary vote to curtail expenditure to the Office of Prime Minister, the government is making fresh efforts to muster the simple majority, a Minister said yesterday.
Highways Minister S.B. Dissanayake who acted as the go-between in the formation of the new government told Daily Mirror that Dissolution of Parliament hampered the process of luring UNP MPs.
He said the government could have secured at least 117 MPs otherwise.
However, he said a committee was appointed last Friday to work out fresh arrangements to win over crossovers.
We await the Supreme Court ruling. If it is in favour of dissolution, there is no issue. Otherwise, we will get a few more defections from the UNP, he said.
Meanwhile, Parliament will take up a vote on November 29 to curtail expenditure for the Office of Prime Minister.
Former Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said another motion would be moved on November 30 seeking to stop financial allocations to the new Cabinet.
Once the motion against the Prime Ministers Office is passed, we will go for the next step, he said. (Kelum Bandara)

How effective is The Body Shops Tea Tree Oil
	
A few of many products The Body Shop offers to control blemish prone skin
The iconic British beauty brand, The Body Shops popular Tea Tree range has been every womans go-to skin clearing product line, but how is it so effective
While oily skin is proven to be largely hereditary, there is in fact a scientific explanation behind why some skin types are more prone to break-outs than others.
Our skins natural way of keeping lubricated is a thin, oily layer on the surface of our skin  a waxy substance called sebum. Among the 100 billion bacteria cells that call our skin home, sebum is the primary food for a type of bacteria given the name P acnes.
When pores in our skin get blocked, sebum builds up, providing P acnes with more nutrition. As a result, the population of this bacteria grows. Our bodys immune system fights back against these increasing P acnes numbers by sending blood to the affected area; causing a swelling and redness that allow for blemishes to appear.
This is where The Body Shops Tea Tree products come to the rescue!
Tea tree plants have ever-so-cleverly evolved the ability to produce chemicals that stop bacteria cells in their tracks, catching them before they get the chance to multiply. Owing to this property, tea tree extracts can speed up the healing process, getting rid of blemishes more quickly.
The Body Shop offered customers at their KCC store free skin care consultations and mini makeovers during the launch of the jumbo-sized Tea Tree Oil Skin Clearing Facial Wash.
Staying true to the brands promise of providing more natural alternatives to skincare, each product in The Body Shops Tea Tree range is enriched with varying potencies of extracted tea tree oil. Fortified further with Tamanu oil -which too possesses antibacterial properties that can blast those blemishes into oblivion-, the Tea Tree series also contains Lemon tree oil with its highly aromatic fragrance and purifying properties, helping to cleanse and soothe blemished skin.
The 100% vegan Tea Tree Skin Clearing Facial Wash is infused with Community Trade Tea Tree Oil, which along with its proven antibacterial properties, also deeply cleanses all skin types by removing impurities and excess oil -without over-drying the skin. Use this soothing gel-based face wash daily, for skin that feels notably refreshed, appears less shiny, and looks visibly clearer.
It is a little-known fact that the process by which Tea tree oil is extracted is a tricky one. Let alone the distillation process; even if the wrong variety is picked and at the wrong time, the benefits wont be as effective. Thankfully, The Body Shop works with only the most knowledgeable of suppliers who have perfected the process down to a T!
Customers at KCC participate in a #TeaTreePower selfie competition
The Body Shop in Sri Lanka has now expanded its Tea Tree skincare range to include the Skin Clearing Facial Wash in a new jumbo sized 400ml bottle, and last month, The Body Shop visited its fans at the Kandy City Centre to introduce this new product, at the same time rewarding loyal customers with free consultations and mini-makeovers. Customers that visited the kiosk were also awarded free samples, and also participated in an exciting #TeaTreePower selfie competition to stand a chance to win a Tea Tree hamper.
Problematic skin is best tackled byfollowing the Tea Tree Skin Clearing Facial Wash with the Tea Tree Oil Toner, paired with the Tea Tree Anti-Imperfection Daily Solution serum, and the Tea Tree Anti-Imperfection Overnight Mask.
Shop the new Skin Clearing Facial Wash and the entire Tea Tree range at The Body Shop flagship store in Bagatale Road, and outlets at Odel in Alexandra Place, and at the Kandy City Centre.

The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said they would not align with any political party at the upcoming elections, its MP and Propaganda Secretary Vijitha Herath said today.
He told a news conference that the JVP would contest the upcoming elections with a unique policy and manifesto under the 'bell' Symbol.
He said President Maithripala Sirisena was bidding time without resolving the current political crisis which had plunged down the country into political and economic crisis.
Commenting on the Presidents claim that he joined former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to form a new Government as he was opposed to fraud and corruption, MP Herath said it was an utter lie.
The President failed to take action against fraudsters of the then and the present Government and ultimately he joined the group, which was charged with massive frauds and corruption by the commissions appointed by himself, he said.
The President has claimed that he will appoint a commission to probe fraud and corruption of Ranil Wickremesinghes government. It is a good move to probe fraud and corruption of the government led by him. We urge him to punish the culprits without confining only to reports. He failed to take action against those found guilty by the Commission to probe the Central Bank Bond scam and the PRECIFAC report, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Keerthi in the Spotlight again
	
Keerthi Pasquel, known as the balladeer of Sinhala music, recently launched his latest visual creation Sitha Kohedo Gihin in 3D technology at Tharanganie Theatre  National Film Corporation.
Since Keerthi launched himself as a singer at a young age, he found considerable success with his remarkable voice, which stirred the emotions of his fans and still continues to do so. Keerthi is loaded with open genuine friendliness and humility that is rare amongst todays successful singers.
It is quite interesting as to how this song came into being. This song was penned by one of my school friends, Saman Kularatna who lives in Melbourne. Since the lyrics were appealing to me I got Sanduruwan Jayasinghe, one of the young and talented composers to compose the song. After voicing, I made my Lawyer, Niranga Nanayakkara to listen to the same. She immediately suggested that we should make a music video and she most generously undertook to produce the same. She was of the view that we should up the ante and produce a tasteful visual that can carry a lesson to upcoming artists, says Keerthi.
My goal was to provide the audience with an unforgettable, rich and unadulterated experience. Today most creations are of low quality and standards as the viewers can get nothing meaningful out of them. I entrusted veteran Choreographer Channa Wijewardana to Choreograph the entire production. It was Channa who introduced me to Saminda Wathawanawithanage and Buddika Wijerathne, the creative duo behind 360 Production Group. I was so blown away by their talent and skills and had no hesitation in immediately entrusting the job to them. I must say that both Channa and the entire 360 team exceeded my expectations in every way. It was Buddika Wijerathne of 360 Production who suggested that we turn this video into 3D Stereoscopy. The time and effort spent on it day in and day out was priceless, he added.
The artist Yvonne Roshini Bandara is a frontline dancer of Channa Upuli Dancing Troupe. I feel that she did a marvelous job. She was so obliging and took directions so well. The 360 crew went out of their way to scout for the best location that has an outstanding scenic beauty, which in turn, would help in the video reaching as many fans as possible. Madulsima a village 20 km away from Passara, Badulla was a breath taking location.
I hope my fans will enjoy my new creation Sitha Kohedo Gihin

## Title: King Charles I and the Speaker in 1642 Karu J. attempts to re-enact it
## Section: Opinion
## Date: 26 November 2018 12:33 am
King Charles I and the Speaker in 1642 Karu J. attempts to re-enact it
	
	Betrayed his voters, who demoted him to 4th place in preference for Pabhain Gampaha Dist
	
	
	MR and SLPP will attack previous government including Maithri intheir campaign
	
	
	What will the executive do if the highest Court would declare that his action is unconstitutional
	

peaker Karu Jayasuriya, who was parachuted, didnt make it the hard way; he took to politics only at fifty five when Ranil invited him to become the Chairman of the Grand old Party. He chaired the Parliament which was initially prorogued then dissolved before the SC intervened to suspend the Dissolution resulting in sittings for two days last week which had been marred with violence. The Speaker initially accepted Presidents appointment of MR as PM and arranged seating in the House accordingly. A couple of days later he abruptly announced that he rejected the position and revert to Status quo; announced that there was no government or a PM or a Cabinet. Next he allowed a NCM Against the non-existent PM and government making a mockery of Parliamentary practices; Standing Orders and all norms.
Karu, after several attempts to kick out his leader and when he failed, in spite of being appointed as the Deputy among the Greens, he led a 17-member senior UNPers to shift loyalties and Make MRs hands strong by accepting plum Ministerial posts. He betrayed his voters, who demoted him to 4th place in preference for Pabha in Gampaha District. Can anybody compare such a pathetic, irresponsible man with great Speakers beginning from Molamure.
Back to 16th Century House of Commons
May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me, whose obedient servant I am here, Said William Lenthall, Speaker of the House of Commons who fell on his knees before His Majesty, King Charles I on January 4, 1642, when he entered the House escorted by armed soldiers, and sat in the Speakers chair to seize five members.
Will stand up to executive no matter what it costs me -The Executive Branch has seized the rights and usurped the powers of Members of Parliament who were elected to represent the people.... Karu J. Former Speaker, as reported by Daily Mirror of November 12, where he should have continued: Members of Parliament who were elected to represent the people, but instead engaged in political horse-trading while the parties tried to grab power  [Enormous amounts of foreign currency were being offered, not shockingly, for this has become a tradition for all parties. It was Karu J, who during that fiery Parliamentary election campaign in 2001 who said he would not depend on the weather gods for power for then we will not need a government. But he became Minister of Power who seemed to be so dreadfully in favour of the rain gods, that the CEB imposed 8 -10-hour power cuts. History will remember him as the person who wreaked the most damage on the UNP. Ranil, the ousted PM was charitable or silly enough to take him back and make him the deputy.
Parliament descended into a violent brawl. President Maithripala Sirisena dissolved parliament probably as he failed to secure the 113 to prove a majority in parliament. In spite of having boasted about the support of lawmakers, they couldnt take the manoeuvre to a successful end. We are dealing with a Constitution which is stuffed with inconsistencies, discrepancies and ambiguities caused by immense tinkering it received since 1978 for a specific problem or task more of a political interest.
Oliver Cromwell 1599  1658
Oliver Cromwell, a statesman, soldier, and revolutionary overthrew the monarchy, turning England into a Republican Commonwealth, and assumed rule as Lord Protector of England. Subsequently King Charles was tried, convicted, and executed for treason in 1649. Charles was accused of treason by using his power to pursue his private interest rather than the good of the state. Cromwell was so angered by subsequent happenings that he emptied the chamber and dissolved the Parliament in April 1653 supported by his cronies. Cromwell thundered, you are no Parliament; I will put an end to your sitting, then he snatched up the mace, symbol of power.
I shall go from a corruptible to an incorruptible Crown, where no disturbance can be. Saying so Charles placed his head on the block said a prayer and signalled the executioner by stretching out his hand; to be beheaded with one stroke.
Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) or Pohottuwa
Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa has obtained the membership of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna Pohottuwa (SLPP), at his official residence, Wijerama Road, Colombo on Sunday. Something fishy in all these events; what is their ultimate motive Now he cannot pledge allegiance to both SLFP and SLPP. MR waited for the parliament to be dissolved.Now president cannot hold upper hand. He may win but will he throw Sirisena who not once but twice betrayed MR-- into political wilderness; I doubt MR would trust him  Has MR played his trump card Will there be more MR and SLPP will attack previous government including Maithri in their campaign.
Violating all Parliamentary norms, Karu Jayasuriya allowed the opposition to suspend the Standing orders enabling a deviation from the accepted procedures to pass the motion. President Sirisena has at least diluted the critical uncertainty of his first operation of swapping Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe with MR had immersed the nation into by going before the people for a verdict. Now others must comprehend the truththat its the Peoples Sovereignty, which is the main cornerstone of a parliamentary democracy. Some analysts think Sri Lanka has just been thrust into a worst crisis of democracy after Sirisena announced late Friday evening that he was dissolving the Parliament.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya was caught between two different, moral and legal worlds. The 19th Amendment took away in 2015 his rights as President to dissolve Parliament even if a government loses the budget; the vote on the statement of government policy, or no confidence motion against the PM since the introduction to Article 70 through the Amendment that made it impossible under any circumstances during the first four and a half years of its term. Accordingly, a succeeding government has to be formed only by the same Parliament and only the Cabinet can be dissolved paving the way for a new Cabinet.
Strong points of view have been offered against the dissolution saying the President has no power to do so before four and a half years into the term, as stipulated by the 19th Amendment.

"Karu, after several attempts to kick out his leader and when he failed, in spite of being appointed as the Deputy among the Greens, he led a 17-member senior UNPers to shift loyalties and Make MRs hands strong by accepting plum Ministerial posts"
Some of the fundamental conventions that made the parliamentary system worked under all previous Constitutions, 1948, 1972 and JRs 1978 all upheld the tradition where it could be dissolved prematurely if necessary for elections to be held. All Constitution of 1948,1972 and 1978 had provisions for premature dissolution of Parliament if the state of affairs warrant it. Let us hope and pray for good sense to reign over political extremist and self-seekers.
Mangala Samaraweera, the sacked Finance Minister, who made it a practice to play with a non-existence mila-suttra (Fuel pricing formula) said, We will fight in the courts, we will fight in parliament and we will fight at the polls.
The voter requires a rethink before they cast their vote to those who are obviously untrustworthy, unprincipled, politicians, [90% of them] as we have been doing for seven decades or so. A news item in last weeks Daily Mirror says Rs. 26 million has been paid to so-called Peoples Representatives out of Presidents Fund as medical expenses during the last three years; while the poorest of the poor can get only Rs. 100,000/-. Our unawareness, partisan allegiance or blind loyalties in popular figures is what they value. Good Governance never depends on laws, rules or commandments, but qualities of the men who govern. The method of choosing our leaders is the most significant element of governance.
The million dollar question is what will the executive do if the highest Court would declare that his action is unconstitutional Further, if the SC holds it as constitutional, does it mean that President can dissolve an elected House at his whim and fancy just even a day old Parliament Need the views of legal luminary who are now clearly divided on the issue.
LG elections result expressed peoples dissatisfaction on major issues, corruption, the unprecedented Central Bank bond scam which occurred just 49 days after Ranil Wickremesinghe was appointed with only 43 MPs on his side. The enormous losses incurred including that of ordinary poor workers EPF funds and billions lost on shady deals involved with massive road development projects, coal scam to mention a few. The current crisis needs to be looked at as a systemic crisis, as one of the panelists observed at a TV talk show a couple of days ago.
The people must agitate for a constitutional amendments to reduce the Parliamentary period to three years and numbers to 150, like in Australia, as our politicians are too dishonest and not adequately educated for the future of a nation to be entrusted for longer terms. A Constitution with contradictory provisions one empowering the Executive free will to dissolve Parliament and the other with restrictions to dissolve Parliament has created the current impasse. Will a general election conducted under the same tinkered constitution allowing the sovereign people to exercise their franchise can pave way out of this mess Will they select the same Knife-brandishing, Miris kudu (chilli powder) throwing and the people rejected ones who entered through the back door to the hallowed precincts of Diyawanna back again Whatever it is they have a right to demand a General Election on priority.
The unspoken rule of democracy: three stupid ones will always outvote two smart ones.

Nationalism is betrayal of patriotism - EDITORIAL
	

n recent years sweeping the world is a wave or highest grade hurricane of populism and extremism, nationalism or a lack of respect for minority races and religions a vice that prevents the fundamental principle of unity in diversity.
This trend reached crisis proportion with the election in November 2016 of Donald Trump as President of United States which till then had been regarded as the moral and ethical leader of the free world while being the biggest military and economic power. Mr. Trump, widely known to be impulsive and dangerously unpredictable has spoken openly of his unqualified support for right-wing nationalism or populism which most analysts see as extremism that runs contrary to the multi-racial and multi-religious principle which lifted the US to the position it enjoyed till he took control of the White House. Mr. Trump, in addition to his other faults or failings keeps on sacking cabinet members or close associates, the latest being Attorney General Jeff Sessions who was once among his closest supporters.
The destructive vice of populism, nationalism or extremism have also hit the small but powerful and nuclear-powered state of Israel, which for the past ten years has been governed by the populists if not Zionist Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing coalition. With Israel more liberal Labour Party being thrown into the doldrums Mr. Netanyahus government has virtually crucified the Palestinian people.
Netanyahus regime reported to be actively supported by the Trump Administration, with the Presidents son-in-law Jared Kushner -- himself a Jew -- being the main advisor on Middle-Eastern affairs. Mr. Kushner is reported to have developed a close relationship with Mr. Netanyahu and Saudi Arabias virtual leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
The US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) last week reported it had conclusive evidence that the crown Prince had ordered the brutal murder of Saudi journalistJamal Khashoggi at Saudi Embassy in Istanbul. But Mr. Trump has virtually ignored the CIA report for commercial purposes because Saudi Arabia buys US arms to the value of billions of dollars and the Saudi regime is known to be collaborating with Israels Netanyahu government in working out Middle East strategies, with the help of Trump Advisor Jared Kushner.
It is in this context that we need to see the November 29 United Nations proclamation of the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. On that day, in 1947, the UN General Assembly adopted the resolution on the partition of Palestine.
In the resolution passed on December 1, 2005, the General Assembly requested the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People and the UN Division for Palestinian Rights, to get involved in the observance of the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People on November 29. It requested the world body to continue to organize an annual exhibit on Palestinian rights or a cultural event in cooperation with the Permanent Observer Mission of Palestine to the UN. The resolution also encourages Member States to continue to give the widest support and publicity to the observance of the Day of Solidarity.
Sri Lanka has supported the Palestinian people and the widely accepted two-states solution, though we also maintain diplomatic relations with Israel. We hope the current political turmoil and unprecedented constitutional crisis, now running into its second month will not provoke any nationalist party to create anti-minority violence.
In the shadow of a grand war memorial in Paris to mark the centenary of the World Armistic Day, French President Emmanuel Macron marked the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I by delivering a forceful rebuke against rising nationalism, calling it a betrayal of patriotism and warning against old demons coming back to wreak chaos and death.

No alternative but General Election: GL
	
The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) said today that there was no alternative to the current crisis other than a General Election.
Addressing a press conference, its Chairman Prof. G.L. Peiris said that the country was in an unprecedented situation in which the Government was contemplating to boycott Parliament.
He said Speaker Karu Jayasuriya was partial.
There are strong grounds for boycotting Parliament, he said.
He said even minority Governments used to receive majority representation in the committee of selection of Parliament, but the present Speaker had departed from it.
The Committee of Selection appoints the Business Committee of Parliament commonly known as the Party Leaders Meeting.
That works out the agenda and all else. It is in the hands of the Leader of the House representing the Prime Minister. Today, the Leader of the House has no control because the Government is in minority at the Select Committee.
The Speaker has assigned five members to us, five to the UNP and one each to the JVP and the TNA. That is completely wrong, he said.
He said neither the JVP nor the TNA was entitled to seats in the Committee.
Referring to the attempt to move a No Confidence Motion on the cut off funds for the Prime Ministers Office, he said it was unlawful.
Funds are allocated in the annual budget. It has already been passed. In any case, Finance Bills can be brought by the Government, not by the opposition. No party has 113 seats in Parliament. The Speaker gave his ruling on the Committee of Selection on the basis that the Opposition got 121 votes. You have to deduct 14 seats for the TNA and six seats for the JVP. Then, the UNP has only 101 seats. We have 103 seats, he said. (Kelum Bandara)

Power of the Speaker  in the midst of a constitutional war
	

ast month marked an unprecedented constitutional war between the Legislature and the Executive branches of Sri Lanka. It was a war of interpretation of the Constitution on one hand, in which many layers of the society -from labourer to university professors - started to quote constitutional articles to justify their position on legality or illegality of appointment of Mahinda Rajapakse as the Prime Minister, and that of the sudden dissolution of the Parliament.
The whole debate went on, in a context where even a schoolchild would profess to the fact that power of the President was curtailed by the 19th Amendment, preventing him removing the Prime Minister at his will, and preventing him dissolving the parliament before a period of four and-a-half years (which was earlier a one year period). Some of the so-called experts professed that the President could sack the Prime Minister anytime, appoint anyone and dissolve the Parliament anytime as he wished, even after the 19th Amendment. This was simply the summary of the debate.
In the aftermath, we saw the decision of the Supreme Court issuing an interim order suspending the operation of the Gazette notification issued by the President, which intended to dissolve the Parliament before the fixed period. Unusual events commencing from October 26 had thus created a tension among all three branches of the state, but the events after the Supreme Court decision marked a serious battle between the Legislature and the Executive branches. In this struggle for power and in the midst of this constitutional war, the last remnants of political norms and ethics of the country evaporated into thin air.
Our system of democratic governance was introduced by the British, demolishing the feudal ruling system led by a monarch, and introducing a ruling system based on a constitution. Such transition occurred in Europe following various struggles that emerged from within the public against the monarchy. In contrast, there were records of popular demands from the people in Sri Lanka soon after removal of the monarchy, and such aspirations for a rule of a king (not a rule of law) are still emerging now and then. Despite these regressive aspirations, constitutional governance and democracy prevailed, facing many events which tested strength of democratic institutions of the country. The events occurred during the past few weeks could be considered most serious, bringing the country to the edge of anarchy and lawlessness.
The writer does not believe that democracy is the best way of governance, yet it is, for sure, better than anarchy, monarchy or law of the jungle.
Those who aspire for all three above at the same time, were seen in the Parliament last week, throwing chili-powder liquids, assaulting policemen, disturbing parliamentary proceedings and damaging public property in the house, while the entire world was observing them on the television screen.
When the Speaker accepted a no-confidence motion against the newly appointed Prime Minister and the new government, and decided to go for a vote, the power of the Speaker suddenly emerged as a game changing factor.
Those who forgot the supremacy of the constitutional provisions had this time appeared to have forgotten the supremacy of the Parliament itself. Amidst this constitutional war, a new debate appeared among the general public. What is supreme- the Parliament or the President While the judiciary had put a pause on a gazette notice of the President, the Parliament had passed a No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister and the Government appointed by the President.
The Executive President, who was considered to possess all powers except the ability to convert a man into a woman, was suddenly found being controlled by the two other branches of the state. Some said Speaker could not defy the President while certain others desperately questioned if that judiciary could review the decisions of the Speaker.

"The conflict between the decisions of the Executive President and those of the Parliament signified a constitutional crisis and it has now resulted in a political, economic and social crisis"
A similar debate emerged during the time of late Speaker Anura Bandaranaike when the Parliament appointed a Select Committee to inquire into a complaint on the conduct of former Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva, and the Supreme Court issued an interim order to prevent proceedings of the Select Committee.
The ruling of Speaker Anura Bandaranaike given on June 20, 2001 has now become a precedent to say that the judiciary in our country could not control the proceeding of the Parliament. On the contrary, the Parliament has the power under the Constitution to impeach and remove the President and the Judges of the Superior courts.
The conflict between the decisions of the Executive President and those of the Parliament signified a constitutional crisis and it has now resulted in a political, economic and social crisis. The root of this abnormality runs back to the introduction of executive presidency by the present Constitution, which has continuously been subject to criticisms since 1978 up to date.
The post of executive president is not a component of Westminster model of government. It is an abnormal addendum to Westminster system, which we see as the root cause of the present political crisis.
While Westminster system relies on democracy and supremacy of legislature consisting of representatives elected by the people, an Executive President is also elected by popular vote.
President is a single individual elected by the people, while the Parliament consists of 196 members again directly elected by the people, plus 29 members representing the proportionate number of votes the parties have received.
When the post of executive president was adopted by 1978 constitution, several immunities were assigned to that post, indicating that actions of the president could not be questioned in any court. Subsequent judicial judgments ruled that unlawful actions of the President could be reversed by the judiciary although any judicial action could not be taken directly against the President. The 19th Amendment also curtailed some part of this immunity.

"In this struggle for power and the in the midst of this constitutional war, the last remnants of political norms and ethics of the country evaporated into thin air"

Just as the President cannot remove the judges of the Superior courts,he could not remove the Speaker or the members of the house. By the 19th Amendment, his power to remove the Prime Minister was also specifically removed. An desperate attempt was made to imply that the President could remove the Prime Minister anytime, stating that if one could appoint someone in some post, he also possess the power to remove the same person from the post. If this argument is adopted, this could mean that the President has the power to remove Supreme Court Judges as well, because he appoints them. Therefore, it is understood that it is the powers of the President which has been limited and curtailed over the time;not the power of the house or that of the Speaker.
After the no-confidence motion was passed in the Parliament and the same was announced by the Speaker, the President was seen instructing to pass the no-confidence motion calling a vote by name. The no-confidence motion was first passed taking a vote by voice. Under the present constitution, the President can in no way direct the Speaker in conducting the business of the Parliament. It is also against the rule of separation of powers. Proceedings of the Parliament is ruled by the members themselves, headed by the Speaker. The Speaker on Nov. 16 called for a fresh vote again by voice. The Speaker seemed to follow the Anura Bandaranaike style, clearly signifying that the President cannot control way of the affairs of the House.
The debate thereafter largely focused on Standing Orders and the validity of the way proceedings were conducted by the Speaker, since the process of the no-confidence motion did not follow the regular steps. Standing orders were suspended by majority agreement, permitting the JVP leader to place the no-confidence motion and paving the way to call for a vote by the Speaker on the same day. Those who claim that the process did not follow standing orders seem to have ignored two points. (1) Same Standing orders permit the house to suspend regular procedure by majority agreement of the house. (2) Mode of taking a vote is to be decided by the Speaker depending on the situation, and such decisions could not be interfered by the President nor by the judiciary.
It was subsequently claimed that the power to appoint a Prime Minister is exclusively with the President. This may be true, but the fact that the Parliament could sake the government and the Prime Minister is also equally true. The Speaker did not in any way appointed a new Prime Minister. He has simply informed the president that the Prime Minister he had appointed a few days ago had lost at the no-confidence motion.
Apart from constitutional separation of powers, the Parliament (including the Speaker) is also fortified by the Parliament (Powers and Privileges) Act of 1953, of which section 3 stated that:
There shall be freedom of speech, debate and proceeding in Parliament and such freedom of speech, debate or proceedings shall not be liable to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament. All the grievances raised subsequent to passing of no-confidence motion indicate that those who masterminded the political transition in the midnight of October 26 did not foresee the power of the Speaker in handling the resulting political conditions.
On a different note, it is interesting to observe the way those who often preach of western conspiracies have now resorted to complain to western diplomats and the UN against the conduct of the Speaker.

President equally responsible during past 3  years: UNP
	
The United National Party (UNP) said today that President Maithripala Sirisena should equally share the blame as the Head of State and the Head of the Government if there was any corruption during the past three and half years.
Issuing a statement, UNP Chairman MP Kabir Hashim said President Sirisena, at a meeting with the Foreign Correspondents Association in Colombo had yet again tried to justify the illegal removal of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe by saying it was due to corruption.
The President said that a Presidential Commission of inquiry will be established to look into cases of corruption between January 2015 and October 2018.
The Government that operated during this period was in no way 'A Ranil Wickremesinghe Government'. President Maithripala Sirisena who headed the National Unity Government was not only the Head of State but also the Head of Government. All decisions were made by a Cabinet chaired by the President. If there was corruption in the past 3  years as the President says, the President has equally to share the blame.
We welcome the appointment of a Presidential Commission to look into this period and we also insist that President Sirisena is not made immune to the investigation himself.
Furthermore, the President is reported to have said that he will not appoint Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister in his lifetime even if legally proven that he commands the confidence of the majority in the house. This is yet another blatant violation of the fundamentals of Parliamentary Democracy. The President has no choice but to act within the framework of Constitutional Provisions and the Constitution does not make provisions for personal vendettas.
Finally, the United National Party would also like to remind President Sirisena that he has not been elected for a lifetime and that his term as President comes to an end in less than 12 months, the statement said.

President interfered with high-profile probes: Sagala
	
Former Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake yesterday said there were instances in which President Maithripala Sirisena interfered with high-profile investigations.
As a responsible Cabinet minister, I have never spoken in public about instances in which the President interfered with high-profile investigations. But if the wild allegations continue, I will be forced to divulge details on who interfered, when, where and how, the MP tweeted.
He said the IGP Pujith Jayasundara's recent letter to Secretary Defence over transfer of CID officer Nishantha Silva clearly states President Sirisena had given the order.
This is a clear example of the President's interference in action - a recurring habit these past three and half years. If there was corruption during the past three and half years, President Sirisena, head of the unity government and the Cabinet, has equally to share the blame. We welcome the appointment of a Presidential Commission, but insist the President is not made immune to the investigations himself, he said.

Ranil wants all-party meeting to decide on polls
	
UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe today proposed a gathering of all parties to decide on an election, but said Sri Lanka's constitution must be safeguarded at all times.
Mr. Wickremesinghe said this while visiting the Sathyagaraha conducted by civil society groups against the violation of the constitution.
Political parties can discuss and decide on having an election, but it is essential that the constitution is followed when doing things, Mr. Wickremesinghe said.
The constitution has been kicked aside for the first time and a Sathyagaha is being held against it, while protests are being held all over the country. The struggle to ensure the rule of law and to preserve the constitution must continue, he added.
He then thanked all those who had organized the Sathyagaraha and placed his signature on a public petition against the appointment of a new Prime Minister and government. (Yohan Perera)

Remembering the Uva rebellion
	
Today November 26 marks the day when Maha Adikaram Keppetipola and Maha Nilame of the Uva Madugalle were executed on the banks of Bogambara Wewa on the orders of the British Governor.

The marketing phrase that the Independence for Sri Lanka had been won without a shedding a drop of blood is a fallacy

Today November 26 marks the day when Maha Adikaram Keppetipola and Maha Nilame of the Uva Madugalle were executed on the banks of Bogambara Wewa on the orders of the British Governor.
It was left to Dr Henry Marshall, a friend of Maha Adikaram Keppetipola to take away the head of Keppetipola and send to the Edinburgh Phrenological Society to study the head. Later it was handed over to the museum of the medical faculty and it lay there until a relative of Keppetipola, Upali Keppetipola, petitioned the British Government for its return.
This cranium of Keppetipola is the link of the Kandyan kingdom and present independent Sri Lanka. Credit should go to President Maithripala Sirisena to freeing the Kandyan Freedom Fighters from the stigma of Traitors.
It was the brilliant swordsman of the Kandyan kingdom Udagabada Nilame and Dissawa of Wellassa Madugalle who set the ball rolling on December 7, 1816 for the freedom of the country.
He was sent twice to prison by the British for these acts and they feared him for his skill in warfare. He was in prison for two years in Jaffna Fort but was released on the birthday of George IV.
No doubt that the cranium of Keppetipola lies at the foot of the stone pillar, but Madugalle also should be commemorated on the same day at this very place, because both were executed on the same day on the banks of Bogambara Wewa.

"Realising that entire Sinhala people were misled, Keppetipola thought that the time had come to avenge the plot of Robert Brownrigg"

The head or the decapitated body of the warrior was buried in cognition by the British army who was in charge of the execution and no one has found where he was buried. But the fact remains that both were executed on the same day.
Then why not we commemorate both at this spot - Keppetipola and Madugalle.
The marketing phrase that the Independence for Sri Lanka had been won without a shedding a drop of blood is a fallacy.
Over the years, since the advent of foreigners to Sri Lankas shores from around 1505 MANY HAVE fought to regain the Independence of the territory they had forsaken.
Among them comes Keppetipola Maha Adikaram born at Matale. But unfortunately, he was A Traitor to the country he was born and sacrificed his life for the country, fighting the ruthless British of that era.
It is recorded that officers like Lieut. J. Maclaine of the 73rd Regiment used to hang captured prisoners in front of him while taking his breakfast. So was another Lt. Col. Hook.
Keppetipola Maha Nilame was a heroic fighter, who fought the British in the 1818 rebellion. Governments after Independence have come and gone, which promised that the name of Keppetipola would be De-gazetted from the Gazette of the British, which had declared that Maha Nilame was a Traitor, to the Imperial Government of Britain.
The blood and the toil of the people of the country went to force the Colonial powers to restore Independence back to the people
It brings us to mind the way the British treated one of their own kinsmen William Walsh a Scotsman, who resemble the Kandyan freedom fighters when he was quartered on the orders of Edward the First and his flesh thrown around. In the case of Keppetipola, his Cranium was stuffed with salt for preservation and was taken away to the British Empire and kept in the Tower of London first and later taken to Edinburgh.
The Cranium was later returned, to Sri Lanka and kept in the Colombo Museum for nearly ten years before this valuable property was brought to Kandy - Thanks to Upali Keppetipola.
Valiant fighter Monaravila Keppetipola was one outstanding man who did not seek pardon from the British, even though they were very willing if he did ask for it. Instead, he gave his life for the people of Sri Lanka on the Banks of Bogambara Wewa, which area is now within the Keppetipola Memorial Hall.
Keppetipolas cranium lies buried at the Sacred Mahamaluwa in Kandy over which there is a monument.
The cranium is within a glass case, which was deposited after it was exhibited to the public at the Kandyan audience hall, behind the Sri Dalada Maligawa.
Keppetipolas birthplace is in the district of Matale and this is the only connection. It is alleged that he had a son who was from a second bed, but fearing the British would destroy him after Keppetipola, he entered into Sangha hood and has since then his whereabouts are not known He is alleged to have died while been a priest and the direct descendent of Keppetipola expired.
But, there are many who are connected to his ancestry. But, in the recent past, there is a number of people who are trying to claim relationship to this nobleman. The only man who could ever be thought of was Upali Keppetipola who was instrumental in getting down the cranium which had been removed to the Edinburgh Phenomenological Society. In fact, there was a time, when Upali Keppetipola alone paid homage at the monument at Maha Maluwa, Kandy, by placing a wreath of flowers.
The background of Monaravila Keppetipola begins with Governor Robert Brownrigg who avoided the issue of placing a Kandyan on the Throne of Kandy or even allowing to administer the Kandyan Provinces.
The fact remains that after the disposal of the King, it was said that the reins of the administration of the Kandyan Provinces would be handed over to the Kandyan Chiefs. But they did not realise, the cunning British Diplomacy and the trained Civil Servants who were sent to Sri Lanka and also the spies like Sir John D Oyly.
An innocent set of Kandyan Chiefs was caught in the intricacies of British administration and lost the country through a set of rules that the Britishers called Treaty.
The Kandyan Chiefs only realised that they were taken for a ride by the British State of Art of conquering the countries through diplomacy.
It was an unwritten promise that British would place one of Kandyan Chiefs on the Throne. But, Brownrigg, did not honour his word and was at one time questioned in the British Parliament for his acts.
Realising that entire Sinhala people were misled, Keppetipola thought that the time had come to avenge the plot of Robert Brownrigg, with his posting to Uva to quell the riots of Wellassa. Monarawila Keppetipola tried to redeem the land of his birth. Thus began the Rebellion of 1817-1818 with Monaravila Keppetipola at the helm.
The shameful nature of bringing down the rebellion by the British, especially on the orders Sir Robert Brownrigg, was such that even law officers of Britain recorded that it was unimaginable horror and ruthlessness of the British.
Kandyan Families were completely wiped out and the best of the Kandyan gentry went into hiding, while some sought toed with the British and earned their favours and also converted themselves into the faith of Christ. So much so it is recorded that pandemonium reigned in House of Commons. It was debated by British Parliamentarians even to the extent of condemning their own King for having a representative who knew no decency - that was Robert Brownrigg.
Most of the people, who after the British - Kandyan Treaty thought it fit to enter into the service of the British, had plum offices, while others were stripped of their positions.
When the Kandyan Treaty was signed, Keppetipola Maha Dissawa was the Dissawa of Matale and subsequently the British appointed him to Uva as well. While he was in Uva, a chance utterance to the Translator David de Alwis, cost him his future and his life. He had one day told the translator in conversation that it was time for the British to bid goodbye to the country and place a Sinhala King on the Throne of Kandy.
There was also a time when Keppetipola, punished officers under him who were trying to curry-favour with the Government Agent of Badulla. The Governor became so vexed that he told the Kandy Commissioner and the resident representative Doyly that the people were rising against the Representative of the British King.
Keppetipola also frowned on the methods employed where his work was being interfered with the British. The British on the other hand had their own favourites in Sabaragamuwa, where the people of these areas helped the British to find their way into Kandyan Territory.

"So, it should be noted that the real force for the freedom of the country were people like Keppetipola and other Chieftains"
He also indicated that as the Dissawa, he had the right to obtain the dues from Kataragama Devale. These led to the events of the Rebellion.
A relative of Kirthi Sri Rajasinghe was roaming the area named Doaraiswamy, whom the British suspected as a claimant to the Kandyan Throne.
In the meantime, the Assistant Government Agent Sylvester Wilson sent Hadji (Who was appointed Dissawe of Uva) to capture Doraiswamy.
From the very commencement, the people of Wellassa did not take a liking over the appointment of Hadji. When he went to Wellassa, he had to face an armed gang, where he was taken into custody and his brother who accompanied him was hurt.
Wilson who heard about these incidents made an attempt to arrest the armed gang with a band of Java soldiers. But, he could do nothing and he succumbed to a fatal shot of the gang by bow and arrow. Not content with these incidents, Brownrigg offered to pay 2000 pagodas to anyone leading to the arrest of anyone who killed Wilson.
It is recorded that the British who recruited the scum of their country for adventure, had people like Lt. O Neill and others of their kind used to hang prisoners of the rebellion before their breakfast table and eat in front of them. That was the scum that entered the British Army at that time.
So by first January 1818, the entire Kandyan Province was under war, with the British. A quick discussion was held at the Audience Hall of Kandy by Robert Brownrigg and it he was told that under no condition, would the Kandyan Provinces be handed over to the Sinhala People.
At this meeting, it was also stated that Robert Brownrigg declared that if anyone brought the Head of Keppetipola, he would be offered 2000 Pagodas (The type of currency at that time )
By February 18, the British moved, declaring that anyone who should bring the head of Madugalle or Pilamatalawa was offered 1000 Pagodas. But, with more troops of the British being brought in to quell the rebellion it became a failure, with the intrigue within the rebels. By August, the rebellion was an utter and miserable failure.
But on 28 October, Lt. ONeil captured Keppetipola, due to a sneaking trader who had gone to barter goods to the village where Keppetipola stayed. Three days later Madugalle was arrested, and by November 4, under a heavy guard, both were brought to Kandy. By November 13 both were brought before a Kangaroo Court.
Both were executed on November 25, 1818 with several other Kandyan chiefs. Ellepola Nilame was executed on October 27.
So, it should be noted that the real force for the freedom of the country were people like Keppetipola and other Chieftains. The lands and properties of those who were in the rebellion were confiscated by in January 1818. as belongings of Rebels, Outlaws, and Enemies of the British.
The list of eighteen whose lands was confiscated to the Crown was head by Keppetipola, the former Dissawe of Uva.

Standing Orders and the confusion in Parliament
	

	On 15, the Speakers declaration was not consistent with the proposed motion
	
	
	It is practically impossible to summon parliament during prorogation
	
	
	the Speaker did not see or hear the seconding of Sumanthiran MPs motion
	

ere the No-Confidence Motions (NCMs) passed in Parliament Was the Government of the Prime Minister dissolved on November 14 or 16 These are questions in the minds of many people.
Lets read Article 48(2) of the Constitution: If Parliament rejects the Statement of Government Policy or the Appropriation Bill or passes a vote of no-confidence in the Government, the Cabinet of Ministers shall stand dissolved, and the President shall, unless he has in the exercise of his powers under Article 70, dissolved Parliament, appoint a Prime Minister, Ministers of the Cabinet of Ministers, Ministers who are not members of the Cabinet of Ministers and Deputy Ministers in terms of Articles 42, 43, 44 and 45.
Therefore if a NCM was validly passed the President has two options; either (a) to dissolve the Parliament under Article 70, or (b) to appoint a new Cabinet.
On plain reading of Article 70 we find four basic instances of dissolution of Parliament;
i. After expiration of 4  years from the first meeting (Art 70(1);
ii. On the request of the Parliament on a resolution passed by 2/3rd of its members (Art. 70(1);
iii. At any time while Parliament stands prorogued (subject to Article 70) (Art. 70(3);
iv. Dissolution by virtue of Article 62(2) of the Constitution (Art.70 (5) (b).

"On 14 and 16 November, the opposition wanted to hurriedly pass NCMs against the Government. On both days, M. A. Sumanthiran MP brought motions to suspend the operation of STOs"

Can the President first prorogue the Parliament and then dissolve it at any time under Article 70(3) Since it is practically impossible to summon parliament during prorogation, can the President dissolve parliament without the sanction of 2/3rd of its members during prorogation (As prorogation and parliament sittings cannot take place at the same time). Since these are issues now before the Supreme Court, I leave them as they are.
NCMs are brought by the opposition expressing lack of confidence in the Government. The procedure is stated in the Standing Orders. According to Article 74(1) business in the parliament is regulated by resolutions or Standing Orders (STOs). The latest standing orders were adopted and became operative from April 15, 2018.
Notice of motions should be given to the Secretary General of Parliament. STO 27;-.
27. (1) Notice of questions or motions shall be given in writing, signed by the Member giving the notice and addressed to the Secretary-General. Such notices may be handed over to the Secretary-General at any time when Parliament is sitting or may be sent to or left at the office of the Secretary- General at any time.
(2) The Secretary-General shall, upon receipt of any notice in respect of any question, unless the Speaker rules any question out of order, include in the Order Book for answer on a day not earlier than seven clear days from the day on which the notice was given:
Provided that, any question relating to a matter of urgent public importance may be asked by the Leader of the Opposition or a leader of a recognized political party at the conclusion of questions after due notice has been given to the Minister concerned.
(3) The Secretary-General shall, upon receipt of any notice in respect of any motion, unless the Speaker rules the motion out of order, include in the Order Book, but unless Parliament otherwise orders, no debate thereon shall take place unless five clear days have elapsed since the notice was given. Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph, notices of motions to be moved at the commencement of Public Business shall be included in the Order Paper if received at the Table on the previous Sitting Day.
(4) No debate shall take place on the giving of notice of any matter.
(5) Unless otherwise provided for in these Standing Orders, no debate shall take place except on a motion or order appearing in the Order Paper.
Motions should be considered by the Committee on Parliamentary Business, which is to be appointed at the commencement of every session (STO 114). In terms of STO 115 Committee on Parliamentary Business should consider and decide on the time that should be allocated for the discussion of such Business of Parliament and such other matters as the Speaker, in consultation with the Leader of the House of Parliament, may refer to the Committee.
This committee is essential to regulate the business of the Parliament. The Government party plays a prominent role in this Committee. As at the 18th November, no such committee was appointed.
Proceedings on November 14 and 15
On 14 and 16 November, the opposition wanted to hurriedly pass NCMs against the Government. On both days, M. A. Sumanthiran MP brought motions to suspend the operation of STOs. Such could only be done under STO135;
135. Any one or more of the Standing Orders may be suspended on a motion made after notice by a majority of Members of Parliament at any meeting to enable any special business to be considered or disposed of:
Provided that, a motion under this Standing Order unless proposed by a Minister of the Cabinet of Ministers shall be decided on by a division and shall be declared lost if it appears that less than twenty Members of Parliament voted in the majority in support of such motion.
Sumanthiran MP had not given proper notice of the motions (on suspension of STOs). Accordingly they were neither in the Order Book nor the Order paper. Further the motions were silent as to (a) the intended special business to be considered on suspension and (b) the specific STO or STOs to be suspended. These mandatory requirements were not met with. The motions were illegal and void. On both days (14 and 16) the STOs were not suspended when Anura Kumara Dissanayake, MP, was proposing the NCMs to the parliament.
Further on Nov.15, the Speaker did not see or hear the seconding of parliamentarian M. A. Sumanthirans motion. The speaker relied on an unknown bystander for information. The Speaker cannot delegate his functions or rely on hearsay evidence.
Therefore NCMs (on both days) should go through the normal procedure. In order to be valid notice of motions should have been given in terms of STO27 and included in the Order Book. No debate thereon could have taken place unless five clear days have elapsed since the notice was given. They should have been presented to the Committee on Parliamentary Business and then entered in the Order Paper. No copies of the motion were given to the members. No debate was held.
Voting
STOs 47 and 48 are applicable for voting;
47. (1) The question shall be put by the Speaker and the votes may be taken by voices, Ayes and Noes, and the result may be declared by the Speaker.
(2) Any Member who is not agreeable with the decision of the Speaker may call for a division for a vote to be taken in any of the following methods as may be determined by the Speaker. In such case the division bells shall be rung for five minutes and thereafter -
(a) a division shall be taken by counting the Members row by row, rising in their places in support or against the motion before the House;
(b) a division shall be taken by the use of the electronic vote recorder. The Members shall press the appropriate button to indicate the decision of such Members within the time period allowed by the Speaker;
(c) a division shall be taken by the Secretary-General asking each Member separately as to how that Member desires to vote and shall record the votes accordingly. The Secretary-General shall first ask the Prime Minister and then the Ministers of the Cabinet of Ministers, Ministers who are not members of the Cabinet of Ministers and the Deputy Ministers in the respective alphabetical order of their names and then the other Members in the alphabetical order of their names. Any Member may if he wishes to decline to vote state such fact to the Secretary-General. In such case the Secretary-General shall record the name of such Member as having declined to vote.
(3) The Speaker shall announce the numbers of the votes for and against the decision and if the votes are equal the Speaker shall cast a deciding vote. The Speaker shall then declare the result of the division.

"NCMs are brought by the opposition expressing lack of confidence in the Govt. The procedure is stated in the Standing Orders. According to Article 74(1) business in the parliament is regulated by resolutions or Standing Orders (STOs) The latest standing orders were adopted and became operative from April 15, 2018"
48. In the event of confusion or inaccuracy in the course of a division concerning the numbers or names recorded, which cannot otherwise be corrected, the Speaker shall direct the House to proceed to another division immediately thereafter. On both days voting was to be taken on four occasions; two on motions of suspension of STOs and two on NCMs.
The first method of taking a vote is by voice. Only two words acceptable for counting; Ayes and Noes: (Sinhala Pakshai / Vipakshai).We heard no such words voicing from the house.
If a member does not agree with the decision of the speaker, a division for a vote should be taken. The Bells should be rung. Vote could be taken in one of the three ways. In terms of STO 135, Vote by voice is not permissible on suspension motions proposed by member who is not a Minister. On both days the Speaker admitted the need to have voting by name. Having decided to take vote on division (by name) he cannot thereafter go backwards and have on voice. Further he did not declare the results; instead said of the consent of the majority, which is not provided in the STOs. On 15, the Speakers declaration was not consistent with the proposed motion. The Speaker never declared whether the motions were passed or not. All motions ended with a nullity. Therefore NCMs were not passed according to law. There are dozens of other violations of parliamentary procedures and practices which rendered NCMs null and void. Only few are stated here.
Conclusion
On Nov. 14 and 16, STOs were not suspended. Therefore when the no-confidence motions were proposed, STOs stood operative. All motions were moved violating STOs. Voting was defective. The Speakers pronouncements were inconsistent with the motions moved. The entire exercise was a nullity. No damage done to the Government. Cabinet was not dissolved. Therefore the President has no ground to act under Article 48(2).

Tens of thousands protest in India for controversial Hindu temple
	

AYODHYA AFP Nov25, 2018- Tens of thousands of Hindu hardliners rallied Sunday for a temple to be built at a disputed Indian holy site, where an ancient mosque was razed in 1992 sparking deadly riots. 
Huge crowds of saffron-clad protesters, some waving swords and chanting Praise Be to Ram, massed in Ayodhya in northern Uttar Pradesh state where right-wing Hindu groups want a grand temple to their god constructed. 
Organisers had expected 300,000 demonstrators to attend rallies in Ayodhya and two other Indian cities, with protesters arriving by bus and train throughout the day. 
Security measures were beefed up, with some 5,000 additional police deployed to protest areas, especially in Ayodhya. Many Hindus believe a spot there marks the birthplace of Ram and that a medieval mosque that stood there for 460 years was only built after the destruction of an earlier temple. 
Hindu zealots reduced the Babri Mosque to rubble in 1992, kicking off riots across India that left thousands dead, most of them Muslims.

Two top former Khmer Rouge leaders sentenced
	
Justice is not perfect. But its better than no justicewhats the alternative

The sentencing of the two senior most living leaders of the murderous Khmer Rouge regime of Kampuchea will probably be the high water mark of a controversial trial, which has lasted 12 years and cost $320 million.
Pressure from the Government of Prime Minister Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge leader who later defected, has hindered the process considerably.
Khieu Samphan, 87, Khmer Rouge Head of State, and Nuon Chea, 92, second-in-command to Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot, were already serving life sentences given in 2014 for crimes against humanity committed between 1977-79.
This time, they were convicted of genocide and mass rape which occurred through a state policy of forced marriages.

"They were convicted of genocide and mass rape which occurred through a State policy of forced marriages"
The verdict, given by Judge Nil Nonn, detailed the horrific acts committed inside the infamous S-21 prison, overseen by Nuon Chea for two years. As the list of crimes was read out, Nuon Chea, described as Pol Pots right hand and asked to be led out of the courtroom.
The judgement, by a panel of three Kampuchean and two international judges, said that Khieu Samphan encouraged, incited and legitimized the criminal policies that led to the deaths of civilians on a massive scale.
Khieu Samphan represented Kampuchea during the Non-Aligned Conference in Colombo in 1976. The court declared both men responsible for murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, imprisonment, torture, persecution on religious, racial and political grounds, enforced disappearances and mass rape. By 1979, when a Vietnamese invasion forced the Khmer Rouge to flee, one in four Kampucheans (about 1.7 million people) had been killed.
The trials were conducted by the extraordinary chambers in the courts of Cambodia (ECCC) and face faced criticism over snails pace progress and the low number of convictions.

"Khmer Rouge leaders are sentenced for Crimes Against Humanity"
There have only been three so far. The first to be convicted was Kaing Guek Eav (Comrade Duch), who ran the SS-21 camp where at least 14,000 people were tortured to death.
There are three more Khmer Rouge leaders awaiting trial, but Hun Sen is opposing this, claiming that further cases risked plunging Cambodia into civil war.
But Alexander Hinton, director of the Centre for the Study of Genocide and Human Rights, and UNESCO chair on genocide prevention at Rutgers University said:
Justice is not perfect. But its better than no justice. And whats the alternative Impunity for mass murder.

Wasantha regrets playing lead role in political drama
	
UNP MP Wasantha Senanayake, who rejoined the UNP after a series of topsy-turvy events, expressed regret today at becoming an actor in the current political drama.
I have become an actor in the current political drama, and I ask pardon from UNPers in Polonnaruwa. I also ask pardon from the President and Prime Minister if I have offended them, Mr. Senanayake, who was sworn in as Minister of Tourism and Wildlife, told the media at Temple Trees this evening.
He said he had decided to return to the UNP as he felt his departure would not be favourable to the party at this crucial time. Asked whether people could expect yet another U-turn from him, he assured that there would be no more crossing over from him.
UNP General Secretary Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said Mr. Senanayake went to the Cabinet meeting recently to hand in his resignation. Mr. Senanayake was going to vote with us in Parliament last week but he could not make it to the House last Friday, he said.
Mr. Senanayake had been under tremendous pressure from the UPFA and therefore we told him to remain with them and vote with us at the right time, Mr. Kariyawasam said.
"There are others in the UNP who have been pressurized to shift sides. An MP from the Gampaha District has been offered Rs 200 million as an advance. He informed us about this during the UNP group meeting, and we have told him to be silent and vote with us at the right time, he added. (Yohan Perera)
