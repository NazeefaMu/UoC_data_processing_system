Foreign investor may get 5,000 acres on lease in SL: FM
	
	Land to a foreign investor up to a maximum of 5,000 acres and relax the criteria in respect of projects which are labour intensive with the focus on job creation, Finance Minister, Ravi Karunanayake, told The Hindu.
	Earlier, the lease tax was very stiff, Mr. Karunanayake said. A foreign firm can do business without paying 100 per cent tax on leasing of land, though they would not be able to buy land in the island nation. The only stipulation for the investors getting 99-year-long lease would be that they should not indulge in buying land and their investments should be active.
	For the purpose of foreign investments, the government had identified many thrust areas, each having a potential of two billion dollars.
	Asked whether foreigners would be allowed for projects proposed under the public-private partnership (PPP) mode in respect of the dairy sector and the construction of 100,000 houses in five years, Mr Karunanayake replied in the affirmative and said the term private would mean a local or a foreign investor while the term public would refer only to citizens of the country.

MR has only 102 military personnel for his security
	
While claiming that 500 soldiers had not been assigned to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa at all as reported, his spokesman said that Mr. Rajapaksa was in need for 500 more military personnel for his security as his life was in danger, instead of current strength of 102.
Spokesman Rohan Weliwita said Rajapaksa only had 102 military personnel for his private security at the moment, a number that needed to be increased to 500 with the release of LTTE detainees, who have not been rehabilitated, last month by the government.
Of the 102 soldiers, 80 were engaged in field duties while the remaining 22 were assigned to administrative duties.
When asked if President Maithripala Sirisena had ordered the immediate withdrawal of 500 personnel from the former Presidents security team, Weliwita said 500 soldiers had not been assigned to Rajapaksa at all.
These are false rumours spread by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake. Mr. Rajapaksa was not assigned such a team to begin with, he said.
Thirty one ex-LTTE detainees were released by Colombo Chief Magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya last month on strict bail conditions following the approval of the Attorney Generals Department.
At present there are two former presidents in the country. One of is Mr. Rajapaksa, who defeated the LTTE and other is former president Chandrika Kumaratunga. There is no threat on her as she did not defeat the LTTE, Weliwita said.
A request to assign more soldiers for the Former Presidents security team had already been made to the government, the Spokesman said.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

Travel agency allegedly cheated pilgrims
	
The Police Fraud Investigation Bureau has commenced an inquiry into a case where over one hundred local pilgrims who went on a pilgrimage to India were allegedly deceived by the travel agency that sent them.
Fraud Bureau officials had recorded the statements of over a hundred pilgrims at the Bandaranaike International Airport, on their return from India last evening.
Police Spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said the officials had begun a probe into possible criminal breach of trust, following a complaint lodged by the family members of the pilgrims.
He said the pilgrims had informed their families in Sri Lanka that the agency that had promised to take them on a tour of several sites of religious significance to Buddhists -- in North India -- but had omitted several important ones.
The agency had also charged them extra for various items after they arrived in India, though these had been included in the package deal.
The ASP said the pilgrims had reportedly faced many difficulties during their pilgrimage -- at Bodh Gaya and other places in Bihar. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)
