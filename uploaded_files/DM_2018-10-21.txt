Army rejects UN charges against Lt. Col. Amunupure; but says comply written request
	
The Sri Lanka Army said today that it would prove that Commander of its 200-strong contingent assigned to the UN peacekeeping force in Mali Lt. Col. Kalana Amunupure, was not guilty of any Human Rights abuses in the last stages of the war.
Military Spokesman Brigadier Sumith Atapattu said however that it would comply with the UN request and take steps to recall Lt. Col. Amunupure, when an official request was received.
We have been informed that there was a request to recall the commander who is leading the UN peacekeeping contingent in Mali, he said.
But it was only a verbal request. We will recall the Commander according to the formalities following an official request. If the UN does not want him there, we have to recall him.
However, we do not agree with the allegation. He has not done anything wrong. He has not committed any war crime. We will appeal and send him back, Brigadier Atapattu said.
He said this was the second UN peacekeeping mission of Lt. Col. Amunupure.
The Brigadier said the first 200-strong Combat Convoy Company (CCC) contingent led by Lt. Col. Kalana Amunupure was scheduled to return upon completion of their one-year tenure in Mali this December.
He said 20 officers and 240 other rankers commanded by Lieutenant Colonel K.L.I. Karunanayake with Major P.G.J Suriyasena as his Second-in-Command, would undertake responsibilities in Mali as replacement for the first CCC.
Last week, the United Nations asked the Sri Lankan Government to immediately recall the commander of the Sri Lankan UN peacekeeping force in Mali following its review of his Human Rights records.
UN Spokesman Stephane Dujarric announced that the request for Lt. Col. Amunupure to leave Mali was made based on recently received information. He gave no details.
A total of 19,000 members of the Sri Lanka Army have to-date served in UN peacekeeping missions either as Combat Troops, Military Observers (156), Staff Officers or as Assistants to Staff Officers in several parts of the world.
During their overseas duties, three Sri Lankan Peacekeepers had died during 2005 and 2007.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

Four ministers with RAW links will be exposed: Amaraweera
	
Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera claimed that four Cabinet Ministers, having links with RAW (Research and Analysis Wing), had leaked information related to President Maithripala Sirisenas remarks purportedly critical of India and China to Indian journalists.
Minister Amaraweera said this at a public gathering in Beliatta, Hambantota.
He said, There were media reports that the President made remarks critical of India and China. These claims are utterly false. The Indian journalist concerned had said that she had spoken to 4 ministers to get the information for her story. We have to find out who those ministers are. Once I get it confirmed, I will expose them. It is wrong to discuss what transpired at a Cabinet meeting with outsiders. It is even wrong to discuss such matters with the media. We are all collectively bound to uphold Cabinet secrets. If there is anyone breaching this trust, we have the right to take them to task,Amaraweera said. (Aneesha Manage)

Govt should go on in one direction: Wasantha
	
Government should go one direction without going on two directions, State Minister Wasantha Senanayake said over the week end.
Mr. Senanayake who was speaking to journalists after the launch of the book F. R. Senanayake, an illustrious son of Sri Lanka on Saturday at the Sri Lanka Foundation (SLF) said the government should go on in one direction. Government seemed to be going on in one direction at the moment and it is better for the country if it goes on in one single direction, Mr. Senanayake said.
I am not satisfied with the progress of the government but the government is not the cause of some issues, he added.
Referring to the current political situation he said some reports may be false but highlighted that there could be crossover to either sides when elections draws near.
Making the welcoming speech at the book launch, the State Minister said the political leaders of the present time are polls apart when compared with the political leaders of yesteryear such as late Prime Minister D. S. Senanayake and F. R. Senanayake.
Corruption had crept in so much in politics today that it is hard to find an MP in Parliament who does not have corruption charges, he said.(Yohan Perera)

Sri Lankan projects delayed, PM Modi tells Ranil
	
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and visiting Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Saturday discussed the progress of a number of pending development projects, with the former expressing concern over delays, said a press release issued by the Sri Lankan PMs office.
Mr. Narendra Modi has expressed his concern over the implementation of Indo-Sri Lanka joint development projects in accordance with the MoU signed between India and Sri Lanka in 2017  Mr. Modi said he was not satisfied with the response he had received from the Sri Lankan government to his overtures, said the release in Sinhala. Indias completed projects in Sri Lanka have been largely in the housing sector, and according to the release, Mr. Modi, during the meeting, agreed to finance another 10,000 homes for tea estate workers.
The statement came in sharp contrast to the more blandly worded release from the External Affairs Ministry about the meeting. Prime Ministers discussed the entire gamut of bilateral relations and ways to further deepen the historically close and friendly relations between the two countries ... They also reviewed the progress in implementation of various decisions taken during high-level exchanges in the recent past, it said.
Ministry officials present at the meeting said the delayed projects had indeed been the main subject of discussion, but characterised Mr. Modis reaction as taking stock of progress on the projects rather than disappointment.
During Mr. Wickremesinghes previous official visit to Delhi in April 2017, the two nations signed a memorandum of understanding between India and Sri Lanka for cooperation in economic projects. Under the MoU, Letters of Intent (LoI) were to be issued to India for most of the projects between May and September in 2017, but little or no movement has been made even a year later.
Some of the delay is over concerns that India would be allowed to acquire Sri Lankan land. Officials say the projects have also run into rough weather because of the deep disagreements between President Maithripala Sirisena and Mr. Wickremesinghe, who belong to rival parties, and the release from the Lankan PMs office indicated the sharp divide.
The pending projects include an LNG terminal in Kerawalapitiya near Colombo, a 50-100 MW solar power plant in Sampur, an oil tank farm in Trincomalee and a container terminal in the Colombo port. There has been little word on a proposal for India to develop the Palaly airport near Jaffna and the Mattala airport near Hambantota. The preferential trade treaty, Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement, still awaits clearances as it faces opposition from Sri Lankan business chambers. Mr. Wickremesinghe has been pushing for India to be handed the container terminal, while President Sirisena wants to retain it for Sri Lanka. At the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, they are said to have openly aired their differences.(The Hindu)
