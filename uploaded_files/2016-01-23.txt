Kidney racket: Indian police to work with SL
	
Indian police said yesterday working with Sri Lankan investigating team was necessary for them to carry out investigations into the recently busted kidney racket since the conspiracy and execution of the racket took place in India and Sri Lanka, The Hindu Newspaper reported.
?Working with Sri Lankan investigating team is necessary for us since the conspiracy and execution of the racket took place in India and Sri Lanka,? Nalgonda Superintendent of Police Vikram Jeet Duggal said.
He said six doctors of Sri Lanka practicing in Colombo and some Indian doctors working in different hospitals in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, will be questioned by the Nalgonda district police.
Welcoming the Sri Lankan government?s decision to suspend the kidney transplantation surgeries of foreigners in the country, the SP said it would help expedite investigation into the racket.
While the doctors in Colombo had performed surgeries related to transplantation of kidneys there, the doctors in Ahmedabad conducted diagnostic tests on the patients and donors. To take the case to the logical end, interrogation of the doctors in Colombo is necessary, said Nalgonda SP Jeet Duggal on Friday.
The entire work of the illegal transplantation of human organs came to a standstill in South Asia following the Lankan government decision, Mr. Duggal said.
Nalgonda police arrested eight paid donors and the kingpin of the international kidney racket, Suresh Prajapathi, prompting the Sri Lankan government to take the decision. Prajapathi admitted to his interrogators that five of his associates, who played a key role in facilitating the kidney transplantations in Lankan hospitals, are still holed up in Colombo.
Investigators had identified 60 donors and 60 recipients connected to the racket. Over a dozen accomplices of the kingpin too are on the radar of the police.

NCPA wants lengthier paternal leave
	
The National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) was contemplating on urging the Government to enact or amend laws to grant lengthier paternal leaves, NCPA Chairperson Dr. Natasha Balendra said yesterday.
?Currently, fathers of new born babies are given only three days? leave,? she said.
The decision had been made with the purpose of strengthening and enhancing the responsibility vested in fathers on their children, she said.
"The common adage, which says it, is mother who is more responsible for a child is not true. Father's dedication also has a significant place in a child's life.
But it is inadequate. Granting more leave for fathers will give them more time to spend with their children. The bond between a child and a father should be stronger," Dr. Balendra stated.
She said that the NCPA had received 10,732 complaints on various child abuse cases last year.
Among the 10,732 complaints, legal action was taken against on 2,784 cases.(Piyumi Fonseka)
