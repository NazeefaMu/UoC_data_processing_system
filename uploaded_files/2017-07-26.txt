A world without colour
	
?
?
Have you ever seen a breathtaking picturesque scene of Mother Nature in all her glory and wondered how beautiful life can be, while taking in every shade of colour? But what would happen if you were plunged into a world of shadows, unable to see certain colours or worse a world consisting only of grey? This is the day in a life of a person suffering from colour blindness. ??
?
?Blue is the richest colour for me, I can see all of blue?-Mark Zuckerburg, Co-Founder of Facebook
?Ever wondered why facebook?s main colour is all about blue? Mark Zuckerburg, the co-founder of facebook and a successful internet entrepreneur, is red-green colour blind. Blue is a colour that he can see with great visual acuity, hence becoming the theme colour of facebook.
??
What is colour blindness? What causes colour blindness? Can it be cured? Dr.M. Wijetunge, Retired Consultant Eye Surgeon of the Ragama Teaching Hospital, shed more ?colour? to the questions revolving around colour blindness. ??
?
Definition ??
Colour blindness is the decreased ability to see colour or the inability to differentiate between certain colours. Dr.Wijetunge stated that more men fall victim to the clutches of colour blindness compared to females. ?About 5-8% of men suffer from colourblindness while female patients with this defect are 0.5-0.8% of the world population,? said Dr. Wijetunge. ??
?
?Types ??
?There are several types of colour blindness depending on the defect of the eye, such as red-green colour blindness, yellow-blue colour blindness and total colour blindness among other types,? the doctor added. According to Dr. Wijetunge, the most common type of colour blindness is the red-green colour blindness where, in most cases, the patient is unable to distinguish between green-yellow-red shades from a mixture of colours. As with yellow-blue colour blindness, patients are unable to distinguish between bluish and greenish colours as well as yellowish and reddish colours. Total colour blindness opts for a person to see a world without colour; they see every picturesque view of the world in a shade of grey. ??
?
Causes ??
The eye consists of light sensitive cells known as photoreceptors. There are namely two types of photoreceptors: Rods and Cones, both which are found in the retina of the eye. Rods are responsible for night vision while cones work in daylight to help colour vision. There are three types of cones, each which responds to a different wavelength of light. They are red, green and blue cones. Depending on the amount or deficiency of a certain type of cones, it results in certain types of colour blindness. For example, a faulty red cone may cause you not to see colours containing red clearly. The majority of patients suffering from colour blindness cannot distinguish between red and green shades. ??
?In the majority of colour blind cases, it?s a hereditary disease. When it comes to the reason of being inherited, more males tend to be sufferers from colourblindness than females,? explained Dr. Wijetunge. The sex chromosomes specify the gender of a human. In females, the chromosomes are XX whereas in males the chromosomes are XY. The disease is caused by an affected X chromosome. In females, since they have two X chromosomes, just one affected chromosome won?t affect females (though they tend to be carriers of the disease), unless they bear two affected X chromosomes. But males only carry one X chromosome, so the probability of men falling victim to colour blindness is higher than females. But colour blindness can darken the vision of any citizen with age. This is due to the contraction of diseases such as glaucoma, macular degeneration and optic nerve degeneration. ??
?
Can it be cured? ??
?The answer is ?No?. The disease can?t be made worse or better in any event. Colour blindness remains for life.? Though this impairment of vision can?t be cured, the effects of colourblindness can be reduced with special types of lenses and apps. The minimization may not be all that successful, but makes life just a bit easier for those suffering from this ailment as it helps them to increase the ability to differentiate between colours although nothing can help them to truly see the deficient colour. ??
?
Tests ??
According to Dr. Wijetunge, there are a few tests to confirm colour blindness. Among them is the Ishihara Test, 100 Hue Colour Vision Test and Colour Arrangement Test. ?The most popular of the colour blindness tests is the Ishihara Test. This vision test includes 38 plates which are arranged in colourful dots which hold a hidden number or line. Based on what you see and what you don?t see, your state of vision is affirmed. For example, consider an Ishihara plate bearing the number 74. People with normal vision should see the number as 74 without any problem. People, who are colour blind, see the number as 21 while those with total colour blindness may not be able to see a number at all.? ??
?
?Does it restrict daily activities? ??
While the inability to differentiate certain colours may restrict a patient from engaging in activities such as driving and piloting, and even mundane chores like choosing vegetables and fruits, there?s still a world of opportunities open to them. Art is all about colour, but being colour blind doesn?t impose a barrier to the artistic sensibilities of a person. While the limitation such as the inability to drive are important to safeguard a person?s safety, colour blindness should never be an excuse of blinding one from a colourful future. ??

Aloysius?s phone only 6 months old, ASG wants Mahendran?s phone as well
	
Submitting a special application Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda today requested the commission to direct Arjun Mahendran, former Governor of CBSL, to hand over all communication devices he used since January 1, 2015 to date for the investigation.
The ASG made the application under section 6 of the Presidential Commission on Bonds Issue (PCoI) Act based on available material obtained during the investigation which was sufficient to make such a request. The Commission said it will consider the request.
Drawing the attention of the commission to the witness losing his mobile device on a previous occasion, the ASG also said the devices handed over recently by Arjun Aloysius was only six months old.
On a previous occasion, it was revealed that Aloysius had allegedly destroyed the mobile phone he was using at the time in Singapore while interdicted EPF dealer Saman Kumara?s mobile device had broken for no apparent reason. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Aluthgamage says what he told about Ravi has come true
	
Joint Opposition MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage said yesterday the allegations he levelled against Former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake was being revealed before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry whereas Minister Karunanayake and the Prime Minister denied that the allegations were false at that time.
?When I revealed in parliament that Arjun Aloysius? company had paid the rental of Ravi Karunanayake?s house, he challenged that I would be taken to courts for making false allegations. The Prime Minister said I would be taken before the privilege committee. But what I revealed is being proved before the Commission today,? he said.
He said when they complained to the Bribery Commission and the CID with regard to the Central Bank Bond scam, they did not investigate it and added that it was praise worthy that the President appointed a commission on the matter later on.
He said Minister Karunanayake should have resigned by now for being involved in the scam.
Mr. Aluthgamage said high rankers of the government would also be summoned before the commission very shortly in connection with the bond scam.(Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Burundi?s first robotics team to an international competition, disappears in the US
	
?
By By Moriah Balingit ?
The Washington Post ?
Outside Bujumbura International Airport in the capital city of Burundi, six teenagers bound for Washington D.C. to compete in an international robotics competition locked hands with parents and relatives to pray one last time before boarding their flight. In Kirundi, their native language, Coach Canesius Bindaba asked God to bless their journey to the United States. ??
?I prayed that God may keep us safe on this trip,? Bindaba said. ?
When Bindaba uttered those words, he said he had no idea that the teens ? likely with the help of their families ? had orchestrated a secret bid to stay behind and possibly seek asylum in the U.S. and Canada. The squad ? two girls and four boys who range in ages from 16 to 18 ? went missing on Tuesday from the FIRST Global Challenge robotics after it ended at DAR Constitution Hall, and their disappearance set off a panicked search for them at Trinity University in Washington, D.C., where they were staying in dorms. ?
By Thursday morning, D.C. police said two of the teens ? Don Charu Ingabire, 16, and Audrey Mwamikazi, 17 ? crossed in to Canada and were with friends or relatives. Police on Thursday said the other four ? Richard Irakoze, 18, Kevin Sabumukiza, 17, Nice Munezero, 17 and Aristide Irambona, 18 ? were not yet with relatives but were still safe.disappeared. ?
Bindaba said he saw few signs that the teens had hatched a secret bid for possible asylum in the U.S. or Canada. They appeared nervous, Bindaba said, but he chalked that up to the competition and their new surroundings. ??
?Before, I thought they were acting a bit strangely,? Bindaba said, speaking from Bujumbura. ?I thought maybe it was their first time to be there, to see the big buildings that we don?t have here.? ?
Before closing ceremonies, Bindaba saw the teens onto the floor of the auditorium once more. They carried tiny flags and joined the throng of other competitors whistling and whooping, the ecstatic close to an exhilarating three-day competition. From the highest seats, Bindaba said, it was impossible to see the teens. ??
He said he planned to decompress with the team over pizza and coke after the competition, a reward for the hard work that earned them a 73rd place finish out of about 160 teams. ??
Police said this is when at least some of the team members slipped away, taking advantage of the noise and the chaos surrounding the competition?s end to disappear. At least one team member, Aristide, stayed behind. He helped Bindaba load the team?s robot onto a school bus that would take them back to their dorms at Trinity University. Then, Aristide carried the robot to Bindaba?s room and told the coach that he was going to take a shower. ?
As Bindaba unloaded his bag, he noticed something peculiar: the other five team members had apparently secreted their name tags and room keys in to Bindaba?s bag. For the coach, it was a deeply unsettling discovery. ?
?I knew something nasty was happening,? Bindaba said. ?
He then rushed to Aristide?s room: he was not there. He checked the other rooms, too: the teens had still not returned. ?
?I cannot really describe what I felt over there, but it was really scary for me,? Bindaba said. ?
Bindaba also began sending panicked messages to the teen?s parents back in Burundi. But their replies made Bindaba suspicious: one child?s uncle told the coach that perhaps the children were nearby; another?s mother told him to ?cool down,? that perhaps the team was out having fun. ?
?I am not seeing the kids,? Bindaba said. ?How can I cool down?? Just after midnight Wednesday, about 17 hours before the teens were set to depart from Dulles Airport, Sestak called police to file a missing persons report. ?
Bindaba, who was unable to afford another plane ticket and had been assured the students were safe, headed home. The following morning, when Bindaba was still en route, police would announce two of the teens had made it to Canada.

Court releases 15 elephants for Dalada Perehera
	
The Colombo Chief Magistrate?s Court today released 15 elephants taken into custody by the Wildlife Department on a bond of Rs. 10 million each under a temporary license for the Dalada Perehera. ?
Close to 40 elephants reared without valid licenses were taken into custody by the Wildlife Department over the years. A recent motion filed by several owners, requested that 21 elephants be released to be used in Perehera processions in the future. ?
However, when the motion was taken up before Colombo Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara today, the Court allowed only 15 to be released for the Dalada Perehera as it was a special cultural event held in the country. ?
The Court ordered the Director of the Wildlife Department to issue temporary licenses which will only be valid from July 27 to August 15. The Magistrate also allowed the Director to set out the conditions of the licenses. ?
However, the court did not release elephants belonging to suspects Thilana Gamage, Ajith Gallage and Samarappulige Niraj Roshan as there were cases pending against them in Court. Prosecutors pointed out that investigations had revealed that suspect Samarappulige Niraj Roshan alias Ali Roshan was directly involved in selling elephants and elephant calvesfor over 15 years.

IFC partners Commercial Bank to improve green financing in Sri Lanka
	
IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, is partnering with Sri Lanka?s Commercial Bank of Ceylon (CBC) to help the bank increase investments in local companies focusing on renewable energy and energy-efficiency projects.
IFC will help Commercial Bank develop a green-finance business?an emerging field in which banks provide credit to support a broad range of projects covering energy efficiency and renewable energy, cleaner production, green buildings, and resource efficiency, among others.
?There is substantial untapped potential in Sri Lanka for investments in green-energy projects,? said Commercial Bank Managing Director Jegan Durairatnam. ?This work is part of our broader strategy to help clients mitigate climate-change risks and contribute to a cleaner, more sustainable environment.?
While Sri Lanka is a country with high electrification coverage, up to 70 percent of the country?s power requirement is met by thermal power. Tapping into increasingly feasible renewable-energy sources will help minimize over-dependence on fossil fuel sources.
?We continue to strengthen our partnership with Commercial Bank as we partner with them on an initiative to build their green-finance portfolio,? said IFC Country Manager for Sri Lanka and Maldives Amena Arif. ?Investments in energy and resource efficiency are not just good for the environment, they are also good for business since they help reduce energy consumption, drive down costs, and make businesses more competitive.?
IFC?s Green-Finance Programme is a global programme that aims to increase private sector investments in green projects, including energy efficiency and renewable energy, by increasing banks? capacities and confidence to lend to green projects through investment and advisory support. Over the last 15 years, IFC has worked with more than 125 financial institutions in 35 countries, to provide over US$20 billion of private sector financing.
Commercial Bank has been in the forefront of promoting green finance facilities and offers special terms for both businesses and consumers on investments made on green projects.
Sri Lanka is a priority country for IFC. IFC?s committed portfolio in Sri Lanka covers projects across a range of sectors, including infrastructure, tourism, renewable energy, finance, and healthcare. IFC also provides advisory services to promote sustainable growth among small and medium enterprises by facilitating access to finance and by offering capacity-building and training opportunities.

A gabby Blue party purohita from Uva distributed irrigation water pumps among the poor peasants in a certain village in his electorate several months ago. ?And the thankful peasants happily carried these water pumps straight to their respective farms.
?
A few days after the last May Day, the purohita visited this village with a truck tailing his car, and sent word to all peasants to see him with the water pumps given to them.
When the peasants gathered with the water pumps, the purohita addressed them in his typical scolding tone: ?I sent a bus to this village last May Day for you all to attend our rally in Colombo. And I learnt only yesterday that none of you had come to Colombo in the bus I sent to your village. I have decided to present these water pumps to farmers in another village, who always readily support us. Now you all may get back leaving behind the water pumps you have brought here!? ?
The poor farmers perhaps, prompted by a sense of grim humour were heard shouting in unison: ?Appochchi Mala! Appochchi Mala!? while returning home sans the water pumps, they say.

In any case, a Jim Reeves museum in Sweden comes as no big surprise since the country?s passion for English pop is well known (ring any bells?). The museum looks well appointed, with hundreds of memorabilia and pictures, and the brochure carries a photo of its guardian together with Joyce Jackson, Jim Reeves? Secretary. ?
?
?Spotlight? is the club newsletter and still going strong after so many years. It covers not just the life of Elvis, but also many other figures from the US entertainment industry of the era, such as Jim Reeves, Ricky Nelson, Hank Snow and, surprise, surprise - ABBA.

Kandy Esala Perahera faces 'elephant crisis'
	
This year's Kandy Esala Perahera will be without its ?star? attractions -- the tuskers Nadungamuwe Raja, Wasana and Kelaniya Raja, while two other tuskers belonging to the Sri Dalada Maligawa would not taking apart in the perahera.
The Maligawa officials said ?Nadungamuwa Raja? and ?Wasana? were among the elephants at the Kataragama Perahera while 'Kelaniya Raja' would not be available for the Kandy Perahera beginning on July 29.
The Sri Dalada Maligawa spokesman said one of the eight tuskers -- ?Migara? would not be available during the Perahera season and therefore the organisers may have to manage with the remaining five tuskers. He said usually three elephants were required to carry the sacred relics casket, whereas only two other elephants would take part in the Perahera.
According to him, another tusker, a gift from former Myanmar President to President Maithripala Sirisena, is expected to arrive in the country soon. But it was doubtful whether it would arrive before the Perahera, as it takes time to be suffeciently trained.
Meanwhile the Basnayake Nilame for Natha Devale, Gayan Heenkenda said the four Devales participating in the Perahera were facing a similar issue without elephants. (L.B. Senaratne and Nadeeka Daya Bandara)

LTTE remains a terrorist organisation: EU
	
Despite the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruling which annulled measures against the LTTE, the European Union today said the terror organisation remains listed as a terrorist organisation by the EU.
Issuing a statement, it said the ECJ judgment was a legal ruling on the procedure used for listing the LTTE.
?It does not involve any assessment by the Court of the substantive reasons for the designation of the LTTE as a terrorist organisation. The annulled measures cover the period 2011-2015. Designations of the LTTE adopted by the Council later in 2015-2017 are not covered by the present ruling. This means that the LTTE remains listed as a terrorist organisation by the EU,? it said.
It said EU institutions systematically review their practices following rulings of the European Court of Justice.
?The current ruling will be carefully analysed. Any necessary remedial action will be taken to adjust the listings to these procedural requirements and to ensure legally robust designations,? the statement said.
The EU reiterated that it continues to consider the LTTE as a terrorist organisation and the EU's restrictive measures against the LTTE remain in force.

Make your world stop spinning !
	
?
Does the term ?vertigo? mean something to you? If not, think in more familiar terms of dizziness or lightheadedness. Chances are that you have experienced this sensation at least once in your life. ?Even though this is a temporary condition in most cases, pathological vertigo, which can cause a significant handicap in one?s life, is also not uncommon. That?s why we at the Health Capsule decided to speak to?
Dr. Chandra Jayasuriya, Consultant ENT surgeon, National Hospital, Colombo,?
on behalf of our readers.?
?
Maintaining a balance in our body is a complex process carried out with the participation of multiple systems. Your eyes, the sensors in the muscles and the joints as well as the special balance organs in the inner ear, all collect information on the position of your body, the position of your head and your surroundings and send that information up to your brain. It?s inside this grey matter that all this information is processed and the feedback is sent back to the limbs to maintain balance. Some special reflexes that don?t require processing by the brain are also involved. So, if either of these systems mentioned above are present, it can result in ?an illusion of movement? even when you are staying still. In other words this is known as vertigo. ??
Dr. Jayasuriya explains that the causes for vertigo are sub-divided into Central causes; meaning that the pathology is in the brain, Peripheral causes; where the disease is in sensory or motor organs like the inner ear, the eyes or the nerves and functional causes; where the symptoms appear due to a psychological reason. ?
?Taking a close look at history is vital since history is the key to diagnosis in case of vertigo?, says Dr. Jayasuriya. The duration of the symptoms in a single episode will give an idea about the disease. We?ll talk about some of these diseases in detail, later in the article. ?If the dizziness only lasts for seconds, it?s most likely due to BPPV. If it lasts for minutes to hours, it may be due to causes like Meniere?s Disease or Vestibular Migraines. Likewise, causes for dizziness that last for days to weeks and for more than three months can also be determined?, she continues. ?
There are two types of vertigo according to their presentation, ?
1. Spinning or rotatory vertigo, where the patient complaints of a definitive spinning sensation ?
2.Postural imbalance, which is a feeling of being off balance, without Vertigo ?
Out of these, the first group is more likely to have pathology in their inner ear or the balance pathway in the brain. ?
Figuring out what triggers or aggravates the condition is also crucial in diagnosis and later, in the treatment process. BPPV is frequently triggered by jerky head movements and changes in the head position. In the case of some functional diseases, the dizzy sensation may be triggered by certain social situations like empty rooms, bridges and supermarkets. ?If the symptoms occur at night, this is likely due to an inner ear cause. This is because without the vestibule system functioning properly, they depend on their vision for balance and losing the advantage of vision in the dark may thus trigger the symptoms?, comments Dr. Jayasuriya. Dizziness is a common side effect of certain drugs as well. ?
After obtaining a detailed history from you, your doctor will examine you thoroughly, while you are sitting, standing and lying. ??
Mode of the treatment depends on the diagnosis. A condition like BPPV may be cured within minutes using a single maneuver in the outpatient clinic, while a condition like Meniere?s disease will need lifelong treatment. ?
?Now, let?s go through some of the commonest causes for Vertigo. ?
?
?
Functional Vertigo
Functional vertigo is also very common. This may be purely psycotrophical or can follow a bout of illness causing vertigo, with the body playing sick even after the disease is cured. This causes the patient to experience the symptoms. These patients usually have features of anxiety during an attack like sweating. ?Reassuring the patient, regular exercise and behavioral therapy can go a long way towards curing the symptoms,? concludes Dr. Jayasuriya.
?
?
Meniere?s Disease
This condition is suspected when the patients have longer attacks of vertigo more than once, hearing loss, tinnitus (ringing sensation in ear) and ear fullness. It needs lifelong medical treatment as well as lifestyle modifications which includes a low salt diet.
?
Migraine
Vertigo due to migraine is very common. Episodic vertigo with imbalance and, sensory amplification, along with other symptoms can be seen.
?Most likely cause for the vertigo in females who are in child bearing age is migraine? says Dr. Jayasuriya
?Lifestyle modifications is a must. Avoid poor sleep, stress, using the phone in bed while the lights are turned off and playing computer games since these are known to trigger migraine,? is her advice to the patients.
?
BPPV
BPPV, which stands for Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, is the commonest cause for peripheral vertigo worldwide and has an interesting pathology. The inner ear contains two systems. Cochlear system; involved in hearing and vestibular system; which concerns balance. Among the organs of the vestibular system are three fluid filled canals. Each canal represents one of the three axes of the head, supplying information regarding head rotation, with the help of fluid movement within.
In BPPV, Otoconia, a type of crystals from another part of the vestibular system, gets dislodged and enters the fluid in a canal. This causes the generation of erroneous information when moving the head.
This condition causes a special eye movement called nystagmus, where the eyes move rapidly and uncontrollably when turning the head to the side. The main treatment for BPPV is a relatively simple non-invasive procedure called Epley maneuver. This causes the crystal in the canal to return to its original place, curing the symptoms.
?
Since balance is a crucial part of our day-to-day activities, losing it can be a frustrating experience for a person. As our discussion with Dr. Jayasuriya revealed, medical science can do wonders towards relieving the symptoms, so if you or your loved ones are suffering from vertigo, head over to the nearest hospital and make your world to ?stop spinning?.

Maldivian security forces  Shut down Parliament, leading to clashes
	
?
?By Bharatha Mallawarachi | AP Washington Post, July 24, 2017 ??
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka ? Maldivian security forces locked down parliament on orders from the president Monday, leading to clashes after opposition lawmakers stormed the compound in an attempt to vote on whether to impeach the parliamentary speaker. ??
President Yameen Abdul Gayoom has been accused of rolling back democratic gains the Maldives has made since becoming a multiparty democracy in 2008. ??
A no-confidence motion against Speaker Abdulla Maseeh Mohamed was scheduled to have been taken up Monday, according to the opposition. It said the motion had support from 45 lawmakers in the 85-member house, which if it had succeeded would have challenged the president?s power. ??
The government, however, said no voting had been scheduled for Monday. ??
Members of the armed forces padlocked the gates of parliament on orders from Yameen, and lawmakers ?were forcibly prevented from entering the parliamentary compound,? the main opposition Maldivian Democratic Party said. ??
Some opposition lawmakers broke through the barrier, but they were forcibly thrown out by military and police who even pepper-sprayed them, said party spokesman Hamid?
Abdul Ghafoor. ??
In a statement, the opposition party called Yameen?s action ?desperate, illegal and unconstitutional.? ??
The president?s office said all the members have been informed that the next parliament sittings will be on July 31. ?
The parliament secretariat asked Maldives forces to strengthen security in the parliament building premises due to security concerns as certain parties were calling for protests near parliament, the office said in a statement. ?
Maldives police said the government restricted access to the parliament building as the session was cancelled and that police were asked to intervene by Maldives National Defense Force in ?clearing out individuals who forcefully entered the parliament building.? ?
In a statement, police also said they are investigating the obstruction of police duty by the lawmakers who broke into the restricted area. ?
The support for the no-confidence motion was uncertain after the election commission announced last week that four members who supported the motion had lost their seats because they left the ruling party. ?
Yameen?s control over parliament is threatened by a new understanding between the Maldives? former strongman and its first democratically elected president, Mohamed Nasheed. The Maldivian Democratic Party routed Yameen?s party in local council elections earlier this year. ?
A similar opposition bid to oust the speaker was defeated in March with no dissenting votes after opposition lawmakers were either evicted or walked out from the vote following a dispute over problems with the electronic voting system. ?
The opposition coalition?s plan to wrest the parliamentary majority was aimed at reforming the judiciary, elections commission and other bodies perceived as being partial?
toward Yameen. ?
In March, Nasheed and former strongman Maumoon Abdul Gayoom and two other parties signed an agreement to form an?
opposition alliance. ?

Mullaithivu land to be handed over to its rightful owners
	
Discussions were underway to handover the land where the Mullaithivu Army camp is located to its rightful owners within the next month, Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D.M. Swaminathan today said.
The minister said 70 acres of land where the camp is located will be given to the previous settlers while the ministry bears the camp?s relocation cost of Rs. 140 million.
Addressing a press conference the minister said the Military bases should re-located in the government lands and the private lands should be immediately distributed to their owners.
?People?s grievances is acceptable. It is the Army who is residing in private land. People requested to release their land conducting hunger strikes and protests. The defence officials are ok with relocation however ask the ministry to bear the cost for such moves. We already requested the funds from the Treasury,? he said.
When question on the security concerns of the North and East and the sudden spike of tense situations in the area, the minister said the ministry is not removing the Army camp but just relocate them. Therefore minister said the programme would pose the security at risk.
He further said under the programme 150 acres and 240 acres of land that were released in Keppapilavu area before and as the third slot 110 acres will be released in the near future.
The Minister said the ministry is looking forward to release a total of 3,600 acres of land by the end of the year.
The minister said Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan and MP Douglas Devananda also participated in the Keppapilavu land issue discussions. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

PC polls postponed
	
The government yesterday decided to postpone the provincial council elections which were due to be held this year, until a new electoral system is worked out to conduct polls for the nine PCs on the same day.
Elections were to have been held for the North-Central, Sabaragamuwa and Eastern Provincial Councils this year when their terms end on October 1.
The Cabinet approved a memorandum reported to have been submitted by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe seeking to conduct the elections to all nine Provincial Councils on the same day, under a new system which includes a mix of the first-past-the-post system and the proportional representation system. As such the current law governing the PC elections would have to be amended to make way for the new system according to which 60 per cent of members would be elected on the FPP and 40 per cent on the PR systems. The new bill, giving effect to these changes, is to be presented in Parliament soon.
A mix system has been introduced for local government elections and the government is of the view that the elections to the local authorities, already overdue by two years, should be held first to check how the mixed system works in practice.
The government took this decision amid allegations by the joint opposition that attempts were being made to postpone elections by the government fearing defeat.
The JO insists that the elections, due this year, should be conducted as scheduled.(Kelum Bandara)

Pulling the internet addict out of the closet
	
?
?
The Internet is a technical equipment that has the power to change the social structure and also in a positive sense develop it. The Internet has become a daily requirement of everybody, as we now have easy access to a broad area of information, research on education, entertainment and avenues that can be used to communicate. ?
The number of internet users is increasing daily. The effects of internet have become questionable over a period of time. According to the latest statistics, 49.7% of world population regularly uses the internet. This figure was only 1% in 1995. A 55.2% of internet users in the world are living in Asia, surprisingly. Global statistics regarding the internet have revealed that the number of users in Sri Lanka has increased by a considerable amount. The overall population in Sri Lanka is 21 Million, while there are over 6.6 Million internet users, representing 31.6% of the whole population. ??
?
Internet usage has increased due to its? usefulness. It has developed to be a ?bad addiction? and now causes mental confusion in some users. Exceeding the healthy limits by being overly enthusiastic is making it an ?addiction?. Surfing through websites for hours, engaging in social media activities for longer periods or playing online games are the common examples of addiction. ??
According to the experiments done by various researchers all around the world, it has been revealed that internet addiction is most common with girls and boys who fall in to the age group between 16 - 24 years. These users are glued to the internet in search of information technology, entertainment and professional development. Therefore, the internet has become an essential part in the lives of school and university students alike. When entering puberty, they go through a number of changes mentally and physically. Add to this, they also experience challenges in their personal and social lives. The long held close relationships with their peers and parents evolve into different levels. We also observe that some of these internet users remain lonely most of the time. Faced with competitive challenges coupled with the need to find employment and be independent have made teen girls and boys victims of depression, anxiety and stress. Therefore, to get rid of those unpleasant feelings, ?teenagers sink their minds in the internet, making it an addiction. ??
?
?
Signs of addiction
Forgetting basic human needs such as food and sleep, being unconscious about time and lack of sanity are signs that the internet is being used unnecessarily.?
	Showing signs of depression, stress and anxiety are other signs that the internet user has stepped over the limit.?
	Buying new tech equipment and software regularly or spending more time in using the computer is search of satisfaction are signs to be concerned about.?
	Have recognizable negative traits such as lost interest in real and face to face social activities, weaker performance in school and exams as well as escaping from the society indicate internet addiction. ?
Internet addiction threatens the physical, mental and social well-being of a person while paving the way for an inactive and indolent lifestyle. Such internet users are often inactive, get fatter, lack physical fitness, experience a loss of sanity and are sleepless at night. According to researchers, internet addiction contributes to mental issues such as stress, anxiety, depression, problems in marriage and family life, poor performances in education, missing job responsibilities and having a refrained social life. ?
?
Many countries in the world have carried out numerous experiments on what triggers internet addiction and its effects. However, Sri Lanka has done only little research regarding this. It?s revealed from a research conducted using the students of university of Peradeniya, that internet addiction can lead to depression and solitude while crippling a healthy lifestyle. A similar result of a weakened performance in studies was revealed in a research done by the University of Sri Jayawardenepura, where its own students were used. ??
?
?
The researchers ?suggest tips to prevent internet addiction.?
?
Introduce a new timetable to an internet addict by aiming to limit the surfing time on the net.?
Pre-planning the work, duties, and responsibilities of the addict and inspiring him to stick to the schedule.?
?
List everything the addict missed doing, after starting to indulge on the internet, for self-realization. That ultimately will lead the person to use the internet with self - discipline.?
?
Ask for assistance from family and friends to get rid of internet dependence.?
?
Obtain counselling services for already addicted people.?
?
Organize awareness programmes aiming the student community, parents and youth.?
?
It?s our responsibility to use the internet wisely, as well as alert the youth to guard themselves against becoming victims of the ?global net?. This will benefit all. ? ??

Evidence were given to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Central Bank (CB) Bond issuance this week saying Perpetual Treasuries Limited Owner Arjun Aloysius paid the rental of then Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake?s penthouse.
Addressing a news conference, MP Rajapaksa said that there was one law for the members of the Opposition and another law for the government members.
?Had these accusations made against me, anyone in the Rajapaksa family or the Opposition, we would have been put in jail in a heartbeat. However, since the accusations are against one of the government ministers, no action had been taken so far,? he said.
He said even the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) was silent over the issue now and said the anti-corruption secretariat was dissolved with the intention of pampering government members who are accused of corruption.
When asked whether the Joint Opposition will take action against Minister Karunanayake over his alleged involvement in the CB Bond scam, MP Rajapaksa said the leaders of the JO were having discussions at the moment to bring in another no-confidence motion against the minister.

Remedies for intolerable heel ache
	
?
The Intolerable Heel Ache
?When I wake up my feet hurt. I can?t tolerate the pain arising from the ball of my foot when I get up from the bed. The first few steps are impossible to take. I walk awkwardly for some time and there is this tendency to fall as well.? ?
These are the exact confessions I hear from most patients who have the common condition named Plantar Fasciitis. This condition involves the heel and there is a swelling of a structure at the ball of your foot. There is a very strong band named plantar facia which connects itself to a bone called the calcaneus. This band is similar to a rubber band and has elastic properties. If you have a proper look at the bottom of your feet right now, the structure is similar to an arched bridge from front to back. To maintain the arch, this elastic band called plantar fascia works full time. A massive force runs through this band when we stand and bear weight. ??
Causes
There are many reasons why people develop this condition. It could be a minute injury at the junction between the plantar fascia and bone. The injury could be due to repetitive stress. Imagine a professional sprinter or a fast bowler performing their sporting manoeuvres. At the start of a 100m event, within a fraction of a second the athlete is expected to leap forward several meters. That entire stress/tension of several kilograms goes through his plantar fascia band. The same thing happens when a fast bowler is at the end of the crease putting massive force to his foot. ?
Other than sports injuries, there is a condition called enthesitis which gives rise to similar symptoms. At the onset of enthesitis, the plantar fascia swells up. The exact triggering factor is unknown. This can affect both heels and is sometimes associated with pain in the back of the heel. The back of the heel has a large band called the achilles tendon. Both these structures can swell up at the same time because of a condition called inflammation. Strangely this is associated with joint problems like arthritis in a certain category of people. ?
In most patients plantar fasciitis is a harmless self limiting condition, which settles on its own. What we do as specialists is to speed up the process of healing. Also there are very useful remedies that can ease the symptoms of plantar fasciitis. ?
How is it evaluated?
When you consult a joint specialist, he will first of all examine the region affected. The painful areas will be gently pressed and the ankle will be moved to determine which movement elicits pain. The intact side will also be examined. Don?t forget to mention about other areas that hurt as well. ?
Then certain investigations are recommended that includes blood tests like ESR and a full blood count. These are useful to determine the exact cause of plantar fasciitis. Sometimes an X ray is ordered to see whether a ?Calcaneal Spur? is visible. This is a bony protuberance/tip that might cause pain when pressed against the skin of the heel. ?
?
Treatment?
There are very effective stretching exercises that specialist might teach you. These remodel the plantar fascia band and prevent further bouts of pain. ?
To ease off the pain a category of drugs called ?Non Steroid Anti Inflammatory Drugs? are used. These will settle the swelling and slowly sort out the symptoms. There are other types of drugs like steroids to treat more intense pain. Sometimes steroids are injected to the heel to provide rapid relief. ?
A type of soundwave called Ultrasound therapy is used to create a soothing effect over the heel. Ultrasound waves cause the plantar fascia to vibrate slightly and the end result is the generation of heat inside. This heat heals the plantar fasciitis. ?
Infra red therapy is another method to temporary provide relief. The same mechanism of thermal energy is used as treatment. ?
There are splints that can be worn over the foot throughout the night. This might keep the plantar fascia stretched and prevent the excruciatingly painful first steps when you wake up. ??

## Title: School Corporal Punishment  a Cane Cataclysm

School Corporal Punishment  a Cane Cataclysm
	
Corporal punishment in schools came into existence with the intention of literally whipping up students into shape. Medical drugs are important in treating ailments, but when an overdose is given, it becomes harmful; sometimes even fatal. Today corporal punishment is deemed no different to a drug overdose. Used to punish students for even the smallest of offenses, corporal punishment has lost its purpose. This form of punishment has raised anger and has been subject to contradiction by many, hence the opposition to this kind of punishment in general. Corporal punishment has become the cause for many student injuries, from the smallest of bruises to the most painful of fractures. Not too long ago, a nine-year-old boy suffered a fracture after his dancing teacher struck him. The boy, alleged to be a slow learner, was struck after the teacher lost patience with him for not keeping up with the class. ?
Corporal punishment at school may not always hold ill will because the teacher might have no intention to cause injury. Often in such incidents the teacher succumbs to anger. Such punishments have also been concealed as excuses to carry out disciplinary action. There have been times when such punishments have been carried out with the intention of taking revenge on students whom teachers dislike. This is quite common in the Sri Lankan educational set-up today. There have been instances where students have suffered ear injuries caused by slaps, severe cases of fractures due to strikes from the cane or worse - suicide. ?
The Number of complaints regarding cruelty to children for the year 2017 is 1191
	Article 19 CRC speaks of the protection of children
	Article 6 of the Child Rights Convention guarantees that right to life
	Emotional?or psychological abuse is as serious as physical?abuse
?The child put out of class might find not having to work rewarding?
- Dr. Udena Attygalle, Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist
Every action has a reason behind it. Nothing is ever done without the driving force of reason. Within the context of punishment, there may have been a time when it was done with the intention of bringing out the best in children. But with the passage of time the abuse of power through corporal punishment has given the whole issue a negative outlook. If we can dig deep and approach the whole issue psychologically, with the view of trying to understand children, it would bring out a better understanding. If this approach is taken, children can be handled and the need for punishment can be avoided. Of course this excludes the faction of teachers who use corporal punishment for personal reasons. Only law and order can set these issues straight. Teachers must fear legal punishment. Dr. Attygalle highlighted the psychological reasoning behind children?s behaviour and the effects of punishment; both good and bad. ?
It may be that the child didn?t understand what was required, or has a specific issue with reading and writing like dyslexia. It could also be that there is an issue from the child?s side of the family or how his behaviour is responded to at home
First things first. Why do children act stubborn and are disobedient? According to Dr. Attygalle, there are several reasons that make children disobedient. ?The key is to understand that there are many reasons. It?s also important to understand that disobedience is contextual. What is acceptable at home may not be so at school. What is acceptable in the dancing class may not be so in the science class. It could be that the child has a developmental issue such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or autism. It may be that the child didn?t understand what was required, or has a specific issue with reading and writing like dyslexia. It could also be that there is an issue from the child?s side of the family or how his behaviour is responded to at home. How the problem is handled at school too may lead to further disobedience in a child. In cases like these there is a tendency in the child to show opposition and be defiant. In children, it?s likely that there are multiple factors contributing to the issue.? ?
Current behavioural management programs tend to focus more on reinforcing positive behaviour. Positive punishment can have negative emotional consequences. So the teacher praising the child when he does his homework or makes an effort to do so, even on a single day
Forget corporal punishment. Do all punishments in general ensure success when it comes to making the child obedient? There may be more than just a drop in the bucket out there in the society, especially among the elderly who support punishment, especially the corporal variety. These parents are of the opinion that it helps correct mistakes and help develop character in children. Dr. Attygalle explained the psychological link between punishment and child obedience. ?In behavioural terms a punishment is something aversive that reduces the frequency of an undesirable behaviour. Punishment is of two types, positive and negative. A positive punishment is where an aversive response is made after the undesirable behaviour. Most punishments, including corporal punishment, would fall into this category. A negative punishment meanwhile, is where a reinforcing stimulus is removed after the undesirable behaviour. So a child who hits another being removed from his favourite game would be a negative punishment. However it?s important to note that the frequency of the behaviour should reduce if it is to be called a punishment in behavioural terms. If for example, a child is punished by being put out of class and still continues not to bring his home work, it makes no sense to pursue with that method of punishment. After all, what we want is for him to bring in the home work and not to just punish him. Although, when it does work, positive punishment has the advantage of stopping a behaviour immediately, Current behavioural management programs tend to focus more on reinforcing positive behaviour. Positive punishment can have negative emotional consequences. So the teacher praising the child when he does his homework or makes an effort to do so, even on a single day, may increase the likelihood of him bringing in homework the next day. A negative punishment would be that the child has to remain during the interval and do the home work. However, analyzing behaviour and responding accordingly can be complicated. For example if the child who doesn?t do homework is punished by being put out of the class, this can actually reinforce the child not doing homework in some situations. This happens when the child who doesn?t do homework may also find being put out of class and not having to do work at school rewarding!? ?
Punishment can reach extremes which sometimes impacts the mentality of children bringing out dire consequences in the development of the child. ?The issue with punishment is that, when we are dealing with a child, merely stopping an undesirable behaviour isn?t enough. Developing the child?s capacity for cognitive, emotional and social development is more important. Thus, if a parent or teacher can have this in mind it would be of great benefit to the child. As children have different temperaments, punishment can have negative consequences on some. Anxiety, school refusal, depression and even other trauma related issues can be the consequence s of thoughtless punishment. As the child?s brain is still developing this traumatic experience and related consequences can sometimes become a template of how they respond to later situations as well. If the child perceives humiliation, or misses school for a prolonged period of time this may affect social development. Prolonged avoidance of school can also lead to the child feeling overwhelmed with the mounting amount of work missed and make returning to class even harder.? ?
In the attempts to propose child-friendly methods that would get children to listen to teachers, Dr. Attygalle stressed that the most important aspect is to keep the end goal of the child?s development in mind, while also thinking of the immediate issue of the child?s behaviour. ?Talking to parents or teachers, analysing their work and looking beyond a child?s behaviour, will provide us with clues on how to manage the behaviour. It?s also useful to keep in mind that if we try to deal with these issues by becoming upset and emotional, we may escalate the situation with no positive outcome. Thus, it?s important to have ways and means of supporting ourselves, so that we are able to use our adult experience and knowledge in dealing with these situations.?
Teachers are also faced with the situation of having to deal with several children with behavioural issues at the same time. In these situations it might be useful to lay down the ground rules very early and clearly and also anticipate children who might have problems, so that preventive measures can be taken. For example bringing the hyperactive and inattentive child to the front of the class rather than leaving him at the back might prevent a lot of classroom trouble.? ?
?School punishment violates Child Rights?
Marini De Livera, Chairperson NCPA
Corporal punishment seems to violate human rights and more specifically a child?s right in this case. What better organization is there to talk to other than the National Child Protection Authority (NCPA), with regard to issues concerning children?s rights. Marini De Livera, Chairperson of NCPA, commented on the issue relating to punishments at school. ?
When De Livera was asked for her opinion on school punishments, she stated that whatever disguise in which a punishment may come, it?s an outlawed act which violates a child?s rights. ?School punishments in whatever form, fall into the category of ?Cruel and degrading? treatment which is outlawed by the Constitution of Sri Lanka. School punishments violate Child Rights. Article 19 CRC speaks of the protection of children from all forms of violence. Also this is connected to article 24 which guarantees the Right to Health and Article 29 which highlights the aims of education. In a broader context Article 6 of the Child Rights Convention guarantees that right to life is applicable as it suggests that the child is entitled to a ?Life of a Dignity?.? ??
Punishments aren?t always just physical. Sometimes school punishments go to the extremes of a dramatic unleash of vengeance upon the child for personal dislike. This is done to degrade and humiliate a student giving the excuse of making them disciplined. Such acts traumatize the child for life. These situations don?t end well literally. Students in such circumstances have had unfortunate endings. ?Suicide has been reported on numerous occasions. De Livera put mental abuse on par with physical punishment, claiming there is no difference between the two. ?Emotional or psychological abuse is as serious as physical abuse. This happens a great deal in Sri Lanka. The Number of complaints regarding cruelty to children for the year 2017 is 1191. I have received a number of complaints made personally to me, but parents don?t want to divulge the name of the school. Children who are subjected to this kind of punishment grow up with hatred towards society.? ?
In the wake of a child right violation through corporal punishment, the chairperson briefed the procedures taken on behalf of the NCPA. She further divulged on the steps taken with the motive to prevent the assault of school children in the future through corporal punishment. ?If it?s a Cruelty to Children Penal Code offence, the teacher is arrested and prosecuted. If convicted, the perpetrator will face imprisonment and will also be punished with a fine. A field research had been commissioned by NCPA. In this regard, steps are being taken to implement the recommendations set out in the said report.? ?

Sleaze allegation originates from home itself!
	
?
A complaint against a very senior purohita in yahapalanaya had been made to sleaze investigating authorities recently, they say.
?
What is special about this complaint is that it had been made by a very intimate family member of the purohita.
The complainant has furnished a list of property owned by the purohita which includes several mansions and BMW vehicles.?
The family member had made the complaint to the authorities on hearing that this purohita representing a distant district was planning to transfer some of his property to his ladylove.
The purohita had already transferred the ownership of several houses to this lucky lady linked to the medical profession and the intimate family member had decided that enough was enough when the purohita had given as a present a limousine to the lady which she herself had wanted. By the way, this lady being showered with presents by the purohita is said to be a close relative of the former strongman.
Those in the know of this complaint are said to be on the watch-out for the response to the complaint by the investigating authorities, they say.

Strays Snarl as Authorities Turn Predators!
	
?
?All living beings fear being beaten with clubs, fear being put to death. ??
Putting oneself in the place of the other, Let no one neither kill nor cause another to kill,? ??
-Dhammapada verse no. 129 ??
In the recent past, with media?s exposure of increasing disappearances of stray animals?, their brutal capture and the absence of transparency in removing dogs from public places, has given rise to speculation that these animals were killed. ??
?
Especially during the events at the 11th International Indian Film Academy (IIFA) Awards ceremony in 2010 and the 23rd Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in 2013 held in Colombo, the special operation was carried out to remove stray animals from streets as a beautification measure launched by the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC). In the most recent attempt to remove stray cats and dogs from the Moratuwa University, a fatal accident happened where animals were overdosed by ?Ketamine? that brought them unfortunate deaths. Daily Mirror explored the subject of killing animals after the public and Animal Rights Activists poured outrage after a shocking video went viral recently in social media. The video showed the alleged cruelty to animals that took place within the premises of the University of Moratuwa. ??
?
History ??
In recorded history, ancient Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) was the first-ever country to practice an animal-friendly culture. After all, Mihintale was proclaimed as the world?s very first wildlife sanctuary. This came as a result of the efforts of Arahath Mihindu Thera in guiding King Devanampiya Tissa. As a result, animal sacrifice wasn?t permitted and the practice spanned at least two millennia under many Buddhist kings. ??
According to Mahavamsa, the history of strays dates back to the beginning of time, the Sinhalese civilization. ?Kuweni? sent a stray dog to guide Vijaya -- an Aryan Prince who was expelled from India for his notorious acts -- to the village from the shores. He later became her husband. ??
Religious and regional mythologies ? Dogs and Cats were Gods, worshiped by the people Dogs and cats are mankind?s first and most common domestic animals and have played a sacred role in many religious traditions. The dog is one of the 12 animals honored in Chinese astrology. The second day of the Chinese New Year is considered to be the birthday of all dogs. ??
?
Later in 2016 and in the beginning of 2017, State Universities were concerned about removing strays from their premises. They charged that the medical units of the universities had records of many dog bite incidents. The university authorities didn?t hesitate to remove many domesticated cats and dogs
?
Christianity ??
A dog is mentioned in the deuterocanonical Book of Tobit, faithfully accompanying Tobias, Tobit?s son and the angel Raphael on their journeys. ??
The Catholic Church recognizes Saint Roch (also called Saint Rocco), who lived in the early 14th century in France, as the patron saint of dogs. The feast day of Saint Roch, August 16, is celebrated in Bolivia as the ?birthday of all dogs?. ??
A black and white dog is sometimes used as an informal symbol of the Dominican order of friars, religious sisters and nuns. Domini canes in Latin means ?the dogs/hounds of the Lord.? ??
?
?
Egyptian mythology ??
The Ancient Egyptians are often more associated with cats in the form of Bastet, yet here too, dogs are found to have a sacred role and figure as an important symbol in religious iconography. Dogs were associated with Anubis, the jackal headed god of the underworld. ??
?
?
Greek mythology ??
Dogs were closely associated with Hecate in the Classical world. Dogs were sacred to Artemis and Ares. Cerberus was the three-faced guard dog of the underworld. ??
?
?
Hinduism ??
The dogs are worshipped as a part of a five-day Tihar festival that falls roughly in November every year. The dog (Shvan) is also the vahana or mount of the Hindu god Bhairava. Yudhishthira had approached heaven with his dog. Therefore among many Hindus, the common belief exists that caring for or adopting dogs can also pave way to heaven. ??
?
Islam ??
There are a number of traditions concerning Muhammad?s attitude towards dogs. He said that the company of dogs, except as helpers in hunting, herding, and home protection, voided a portion of a Muslim?s good deeds. On the other hand, he advocated kindness to dogs and other animals. Abu Huraira narrated that the prophet said: ??
?While a man was walking he felt thirsty and went down a well, and drank water from it. On returning, he saw a dog panting and eating mud because of excessive thirst. The man said, ?This (dog) is suffering from the same problem as that of mine.? So, he (went down to the well), filled his shoe with water, caught hold of it with his teeth and climbed up and watered the dog. Allah thanked him for his (good) deed and forgave him. The people asked ``O Allah?s Apostle! Is there a reward for us in serving (the) animals? He replied: ``Yes, there is a reward for serving any animate (living being)?. ??
?
Today ??
Even though the animals were sacred and worshiped by our ancestors throughout history, people gradually lost interest in them and gave priority to urban development. In this new endeavor they saw animals as a threat to the beauty of the nature. Dogs were identified as the cause for Rabies, hence the destroying of a large number of stray dogs. ??
Sri Lanka as a country, where the majority Buddhist community practices non-violence, hasn?t paid enough concern for the welfare of animals, especially those categorized as stray. ??
Cruelty to animals has forced Animal Rights Activists to work towards imposing a more efficient and down to earth mechanism using legal help. ??
Despite this country?s Buddhists practicing a non violence, and it being given a foremost place not only from its Constitution, but also in the hearts of the majority of people, it?s questionable why a sudden spate of incidents regarding animal cruelty are reported across the country. Is there a real need to remove these animals from people?s backyard or is it the mind set of the government? ??
From the perspective of the authorities, who removed stray animals, rabies had spread among the urban community at a considerable pace. In 2016, Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha put the figure regarding stray dogs in Sri Lanka to 50,000 and said they were a public nuisance. ??
Minister Musthapha appointed a committee to make a national policy, regarding strays, which would become a Bill. But their efforts never reached the Parliament. Animal rights activists claim the Minister pretends to safeguard animal rights, but the Advisory Committee appointed is nothing more than a white elephant. The minister had stated last year that and if dogs were released in public places, action will be taken against their owners. ??
Rabies was back in the news in January 2012 during the time of then Health Minister Maithripala Sirisena. Animal lovers and animal rights activists raised their concerns when Sirisena announced that Sri Lanka had decided to lift a moratorium on the killing of stray dogs. This came in the wake of the government struggling to tackle the problem of 2,000 people being admitted daily to hospital after being bitten by dogs. ??
Later in 2016 and in the beginning of 2017, State Universities were concerned about removing strays from their premises. They charged that the medical units of the universities had records of many dog bite incidents. The university authorities didn?t hesitate to remove many domesticated cats and dogs. Starting from the Sri Jayewardenepura University (J?pura) until the final incident- where as many as 23 stray cats and dogs were taken out from the Moratuwa University premises-the removal activities were continued without any guideline from the University Grant commission (UGC) or the Public Health Veterinary Services of Health Ministry. ??
Meanwhile the strays reportedly went missing in large numbers prior to many international events held in Colombo. According to CMC sources these efforts were taken to maintain a clean environment.
?
??
Govt. hired private pest control institutions ??
During many occasions ?Ultrakill? Pest Control (Ultrakleen), licensed in Sri Lanka as a pest control service provider (License No: RP/PCS/WP/007) was hired by the CMC. This was to remove the strays from the streets. ??
Meanwhile, on 10th April 2017, Divisarana Animal Welfare Society of University of Sri Jayewardenepura exposed an incident where 32 dogs at J?pura went missing. ??
The members of the society had complained regarding the incident on11th April to the police who discovered that this company was allegedly involved in a racket. Investigations revealed that the company had been given the tender to remove the strays by J?pura Vice Chancellor (VC), a claim that the latter rejected. ??
It is said that the University security- managed by the Rakna Arakshaka Lanka Limited (RALL)- was involved in removing stray animals from the Moratuwa University premises. The RALL security personnel are said to have removed the strays using Ketamine (an anesthetic drug). The animals were mistakenly given an overdose, leading them to tragic deaths. The VC refuted claims that the university authorities were responsible. ?We maintain a dog free environment within the university premises. It is unfortunate that the security officers overdosed the animals when they attempted to sedate them,? the VC told Daily Mirror. ??
?
?
Legal background ??
The law of culling stray dogs was imposed in 1983 and is still effective in keeping with present laws. This allows the killing of stray animals to to keep a check on rabies. At a time when the rest of the world is concerned over stray animals, the first ever nation which was able to maintain a wildlife sanctuary for centuries has started moving towards digging a mass grave for strays. It?s a shame how the law operates to maintain a stray-free Colombo. ??

SRI LANKA?S LAWS ON ANIMAL CRUELTY, DOG POPULATION CONTROL AND RABIES ERADICATION-?
Lalani Perera, Lawyer and Animal Rights Activist ??
Animal cruelty and rabies control in Sri Lanka are still governed by archaic laws enacted over a century ago. They reflect on the thinking of that era that animals are chattel. The punishment for cruelty will slap one with a fine of a mere100 rupees. The government took a decision in to enforce a ?No Kill Policy?. This paved the way for strays to be vaccinated and sterilized. However, still, the media continues to highlight the increase in the brutal capture and the disappearance of dogs and the absence of transparency regarding these activities. While many countries are affording statutory recognition to animals as sentient beings or ?non human persons? with a right to life, our policy makers, are yet to reach that level of enlightened thinking. ?
An Animal Welfare Bill proposed by the Law Commission back in 2006, to replace the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Ordinance of 1907, is yet to become law. This is because groups with vested interests have continuously impeded its enactment. Issues that arose regarding strays have been resolved at the highest level and involved the Attorney General?s Department, the former Presidential Secretary and the Rural Economic Affairs Ministry Secretary (the Ministry responsible for the Bill). ??

?I am against cruelty to animals?
- Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Musthapha ?
As for the Rabies Ordinance of 1893 and the Dog Registration Ordinance of 1901, a group of activists have, through a court case, recommended to the local government authorities to amend these laws to provide statutory recognition to the ?No Kill? Policy and repeal all provision that allows killing. The Animal Welfare Advisory Committee of Local Government Minister Faiszer Mustapha, too has, at the Minister?s request, submitted a draft law to address the matter. This has been done using the globally acknowledged humane method called CNVR (Catch-Neuter-Vaccinate-Release). ??
The government must give priority to get these laws enacted without further delay. Animal lovers hope that President Sirisena will intervene to ensure that that compassion will be shown to animals with whom we share this land. ??
?I?m against animal cruelty. I have other national priorities too. But killing animals isn?t the solution for rabies,? Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Musthapha said. ??
?

?
?I?m personally against any kind of animal cruelty. It?s unfortunate that the incident took place at the Moratuwa University. However, I?m not wishing to comment on it as it is the Vice Chancellor?s duty. Social media claims that I?m behind this animal slaughter which is false. From the beginning I intervened to offer a better solution to the issue. Animal shelters were to be built according the plan, but these efforts were halted because the animal rights activists showed displeasure. ??
?Most of the Animal Rights Activists expect us to let stray animals roam freely on the roads. There were dogs under the beds of the Cancer Hospital. We found dogs in religious places and public markets causing nuisance to the public. The public accuse us of not removing these animals from the streets fearing the spread of rabies and other diseases. Animals should be removed from the streets and provided with shelter,? Musthapha said. ??
Musthapha added that the social media was slinging mud, but warned they couldn?t stop what he was doing. I?m compassionate towards animals. Some classy people are claiming that I?m involved with the killing of animals. The CMC and other municipalities don?t come under my purview. The direct authority lies with the Chief Minister (CM) of the particular province. The Local Government Ministry only has a coordinating responsibility according to the 13th Constitutional amendment. I have decided as a citizen of the country that I too should play my role to put an end to animal cruelty. ??
Last year I formed an Advisory Committee following many requests made by Animal Rights Activists. It was our main goal to pass the Animal Welfare Bill. During the past two and half months I couldn?t attend to the matter effectively as floods, dengue and garbage became national issues. Those were under my direct authority and I had to commit my time to them. However, I give assurance that I will not delay this issue further. Though I have no authority on the subject, I will coordinate with the relevant CMs and table the Animal Welfare Bill in Parliament soon. ??
?
?
?Dogs and cats were a part of our university life??
- Hassini Silva, Young Animal Rights Activist ??
I am one of the main persons who has voluntarily undertaken the responsibility regarding the welfare of the dogs at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura since 2010. It?s from this university that I graduated with the degree ?Bachelor of Science in Business Administration? (Special) in 2015.
? ?In that capacity I have taken part in re-homing closer to 120 puppies and adult dogs born and bred in the university premises and the surrounding area. I have taken steps to feed them frequently, especially during the Avurudu and Christmas vacation when food is scarce. ??
Up to now there?s no information regarding the missing dogs. These dogs were our friends during the time we studied there. We loved and cared for them even after leaving the university. We spent our scarce funds to ensure their health and safety. They were more like companions than animals to most of the students and the staff of the university. There were a few puppies who had just recovered from distemper attacks. One already had a new home and was waiting for transport to be sorted out. One dog provided security to the students (especially the girls) during the times we walked around the university at night. There was even one dog who led protests with the boys. ??
They were a part of our university life, giving us fond memories. Therefore in the name of justice for our lost friends who were cruelly taken away, and for the sake of future undergraduates I sincerely hope this act of cruelty doesn?t set a bad example. This prestigious institute is supposed to inculcate virtues in the minds of the young. ??

?A group of people complain that the govt is behind killing of strays?
? Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka ??
When the government attempts to resolve the current issues gradually, some people are making baseless accusations that the Unity Government is killing strays. They claim that during the past regime dogs were slaughtered in large numbers, especially at the time when the IIFA function held in Colombo. I assure that we never did anything like that. Why don?t the ones who have claim to have a passion for animals and speak for their rights come forward and save the lives of the poor strays who are consuming polythene on the streets? Don?t pretend to be Animal Rights Activists on Facebook or on other social media. I kindly request these people to come forward and offer a helping hand in the operation carried out by the local government bodies to ensure the safety of these animals. ? Strays snarl as authorities turn predators!

??Rs. 200 million allocated per annum to eradicate rabies??
- Public Health Veterinary services (PHVS) Director Ruwani Pimburage
Rabies is 100% fatal. But it?s also 100% preventable, both in human and animal populations. The only preventive measure is to remove the rabies virus from the dog community and minimize its spreading. ??
Around 600 strays are affected with the rabies virus yearly. To safeguard the people the government has carried out many initiatives.?
The PHVS control the stray population using birth control procedures. We are conducting over 150,000 sterilization surgeries per year. Usually a female dog breeds twice a year and has a total litter of at least six puppies. Therefore we control a dog population which is around 900,000. They have been controlled by the PHVS since 2008. ??
However, we never kill a stray dog unless it?s infected with rabies. Our policy is to sterilize stray animals to control the population, not to kill them. But CMC has powers to remove animals from the streets under the public disturbance law. It?s the local government bodies that have killed animals since1976. ??
?Ketamine?, a chemical used as an anesthetic, causes paralysis in animals. This anesthetic is mostly used across the world. Veterinary surgeons (Vet. surgeon) are the only authorised personnel to carry the drug and use it. Even Vet. Surgeons run a risk when administering the drug and might give an overdose to strays because they don?t do clinical tests regarding the animals. However regarding the Moratuwa university incident, if the drug was used by non-Vet. Surgeons, an investigation should be carried out. Unfortunately we don?t have the authority to take prompt action regarding such incidents. In 2016, 21 deaths were reported in connection with rabies. Ten of those deaths were reported during the first half of this year. If humans or animals are affected by the virus, there?s no other solution except destroying them. Any way, the affected will have a natural death after 10 days. The most important fact is to prevent it from spreading. It?s the PHVS? duty and we never kill an innocent stray.

?Stray dogs are a big issue to motorcyclists?
- Ceylon Motorcyclist Association Secretary Chirantha Amerasinghe, ?
The issue of stray dogs is indeed a big issue to motorcyclists. However, from our perspective, the issue isn?t limited to dogs, but to animals such as cows as well. Cows are black and night creatures. They possess a coat that absorbs light, so unlike dogs, remain invisible at night. These animals sleep on the road and cross the road without any regard, often being in panic mode. Accidents involving animals claim the lives of a large number of motorcyclists annually. There are instances when dogs and cows attack motorcyclists and have caused major loss of life and also caused injury. We however condemn the killing of animals and don?t approve such methods as the solution. We believe that by installing illuminated collars on such animals many accidents could be avoided. ??

Suicide bombing in Lahore leaves more than two dozen dead
	
?
By Shaiq Hussain and Max Bearak ??
The Washington Post ??
?ISLAMABAD, July 24 2017 - ??
Pakistan ? At least 26 people were killed and dozens injured in a suicide attack Monday in the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore, officials said. ??
The blast occurred near a vegetable market and a software technology park on the city?s busy Ferozepur Road, close to the residence of Shahbaz Sharif, the brother of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and chief minister of Punjab state, of which Lahore is?
the capital. ??
Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan , the country?s main branch of the Taliban, asserted responsibility for the attack in an email, saying that one of its soldiers had used an ?explosives-laden motorcycle.? ??
A senior police official in Lahore, Haider Ashraf, confirmed the claim and told journalists that a suicide bomber appeared to target police personnel taking part in a drive to clear street vendors from the market area. ??
Earlier, Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan told journalists in Islamabad, the capital, that the nature of the attack was not yet clear and that an investigation was being launched. ??
?Most of the casualties and those injured are police personnel,? he said. Punjab?s health minister, Khawaja Salman Rafique, said that about 50 people were injured in the blast. ??
Suicide attacks have long been common in Pakistan, but in recent months Lahore and other major urban centers have experienced a period of relative peace. Before Monday?s explosion, the last such attack in Lahore was a suicide bombing targeting an army census team in April in which six were killed. ??
?Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan and a splinter group, Jamaat ul-Ahrar, are the most active anti-government militant groups in the country. Both are known colloquially as the Pakistani Taliban.

Tackling Restless Leg Syndrome
	
?
?
?I am fed up of this overwhelming urge to move my legs when lying down at night, resulting in a disturbed sleep. This condition makes me tired and exhausted when waking up the following morning. There is also this itchy and burning sensation in my legs. This appears just as I lie down on the bed to sleep. It disappears after getting up and walking around, but unfortunately returns when lying down again? ??
This is what Anoma (49) complained about of when she met me at the clinic last week. Does this scenario sound familiar to you? ??
If yes, you might also be a victim of this neurological condition known as Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS). ??
?
Definition
Restless leg syndrome, also known as ?Willis-Ekbom Disease? is a neurological condition, characterized by several unpleasant sensations (creeping, crawling) in the legs and is associated with the urge to move legs, particularly experienced at night when trying to sleep. Although, there can be only a single symptom, most people will experience symmetrical symptoms where both sides of the body get affected. In the latter case there are similar distribution patterns. ??
These unusual sensations, quite similar to cramps, occur with soreness. This condition is mostly seen in the calves, while feet, thighs, arms and the hands can also get affected rarely. Some people may even experience sensations similar to shooting darts, a surge of electricity or insects squirming inside the legs due to this condition. The severity of the condition can range from some discomfort to extreme pain. ??
Lying and relaxing positions will often aggravate the restless movements which will keep people awake or give rise to multiple sleep disturbances with various negative consequences. Some of them are poor performance at work, exhaustion, day time fatigue and depression. ??
With a slight female predominance, RLS can occur at any age although elderly people are prone to it more due to various underlying health conditions. ??
Even though the exact etiology of RLS isn?t known, several factors discussed below are thought to play important roles in identifying the signs and symptoms associated with this condition. ??
1. Idiopathic RLS (Primary RLS) - This is the commonest cause of RLS, which is clinically diagnosed by excluding other causes. ??
2. Genetics- With a research-based familial predisposition, most genes linked with RLS are known to affect people, below age 40. ??
3. Dopamine- This is a neurotransmitter which acts as a messenger between the brain and the peripheral nervous system with regard to muscle coordination and regulation of movements.
Decreased levels of Dopamine, due to lack of production or increased destruction on nerve damages, can result in muscle spasms and involuntary movements. ??
However, latest research studies have revealed that Dopamine levels naturally drop towards the end of the day, which is thought to be the reason for RLS symptoms to precipitate particularly at night. ??
4. Medical conditions- Also known as secondary RLS, this type generally takes place as a result of an underlying health condition. ??
<U+F03C> Iron Deficiency Anemia- Low levels of iron in the body can ultimately reduce the production of Dopamine, which will lead to previously mentioned precipitation of symptoms related to RLS. ??
<U+F03C> Chronic diseases- Chronic Kidney Disease, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Parkinson?s disease, diabetes, Fibromyalgia are known to be having a predisposition tendency to cause RLS, if left untreated for a long period of time. ??
5. Pregnancy- Most pregnant women tend to develop RLS, due to no exact etiology, but symptoms will appear usually from 27th weeks and gradually reduce and disappear about 4 weeks after delivery. ??
In addition to above mentioned causative agents, following factors are also known to play a major role, in the etiology of RLS. ??
<U+F03C> Chronic smoking ??
<U+F03C> Caffeine ??
<U+F03C> Alcohol ??
<U+F03C> Obesity ??
<U+F03C> Stress ??
<U+F03C> Lack of physical exercise ??
<U+F03C> Drugs ??
- Antidepressants ??
-Antipsychotics ??
-Lithium ? Treatment for bipolar disorder ??
-Calcium channel blockers ? Treatment of high blood pressure ??
-Antihistamines ??
-Metoclopramide ?Treatment of nausea ??
?
How is it diagnosed?
A complete history on symptoms and the duration along with a thorough physical examination is highly important in making the diagnosis of RLS. However, various blood investigations, nerve conduction studies and Doppler studies will be carried out in order to confirm the diagnosis. Therefore, it?s advisable to seek medical advice if you are one of those individuals who has been experiencing the aforementioned signs and symptoms, affecting the quality of life. ??
Home remedies and treatment?
<U+F03C> Treating underlying medical conditions ??
<U+F03C> Practice regular sleeping patterns ??
<U+F03C> Iron, folic acid, Magnesium and vitamin supplements on medical advice ??
<U+F03C> Regular exercises ??
<U+F03C> Acupuncture ??
<U+F03C> Symptom relief- Hot bath, leg massages, heating pad or ice packs ??
<U+F03C>Drugs such as Central Nervous System Depressants, Opioids and Anticonvulsants (levodopa preparations and dopamine agonists) ??
Take home message
Even though there is no exact cure for RLS, early diagnosis and proper treatment plans will help to improve the quality of life by minimizing the possible disabilities and complications, in affected individuals. ??

A pinkama to invoke blessings on Yahapalanaya Number One was held at a big mansion in the sacred city in the hill country recently.?
?
The livewire behind this pinkama was a madam holding a high office in the upcountry and known to be an expert at reading the celestial map.
When the Pinkama which included a Sanghika Dana was underway, one or two high-ups who worked against Number One at the last national polls were seen moving about as if they were too involved in organising the event.?
The show being put up by the intruding high-ups obviously to win brownie points from Number One had angered a group of several purohitas loyal to the latter, but they decided not to expose the ?imposters? then and there fearing that it could create a scene, they say.

The JO stalwarts had at the very outset decided that their mayoral candidate should be a prominent public figure from a minority community. While looking for a formidable candidate with the necessary qualifications, their focus had come to rest on a lady of an outstanding Muslim political family.?
The city council had been the launching pad of her husband?s successful political career as well.
The former strongman has already informally invited the lady to take over leadership of the JO group due to enter the fray, but a positive response is yet to come.

This piece of pro-Israeli legislation is a serious threat to free speech
	
?
By David Cole and Faiz Shakir
The Washington Post ?
The right to boycott has a long history in the United States, from the American Revolution to Martin Luther King Jr.?s Montgomery bus boycott to the campaign for divestment from businesses serving apartheid South Africa. Nowadays we celebrate those efforts. But precisely because boycotts are such a powerful form of expression, governments have long sought to interfere with them ? from King George III to the police in Alabama, and now to the U.S. Congress. ??
The Israel Anti-Boycott Act, legislation introduced in the Senate by Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Md.) and in the House by Peter J. Roskam (R-Ill.), would make it a crime to support or even furnish information about a boycott directed at Israel or its businesses called by the United Nations, the European Union or any other ?international governmental organization.? Violations would be punishable by civil and criminal penalties of up to $1 million and 20 years in prison. The American Civil Liberties Union, where we both work, takes no position for or against campaigns to boycott Israel or any other foreign country. But since our organization?s founding in 1920, the ACLU has defended the right to collective action. This bill threatens that right. ??
The Israel Anti-Boycott Act is designed to stifle efforts to protest Israel?s settlement policies by boycotting businesses in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories. The bill?s particular target is the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement, a global campaign that seeks to apply economic and political pressure on Israel to comply with international law. ?
Whether one approves or disapproves of the BDS movement itself, people should have a right to make up their own minds about it. Americans engage in boycotts every day when they decide not to buy from companies whose practices they oppose. Students have boycotted companies that sold clothing manufactured in sweatshops abroad. Environmentalists have boycotted Nestl? for its deforestation practices. By using their power in the marketplace, consumers can act collectively to express their political points of view. There is nothing illegal about such collective action; indeed, it is constitutionally protected. ?
In NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., the Supreme Court in 1982 upheld the right of NAACP activists to hold a mass economic boycott of segregated businesses in Mississippi. The court stated that the boycotters? exercise of their rights to ?speech, assembly, and petition . . . to change a social order that had consistently treated them as second-class citizens? rested ?on the highest rung of the hierarchy of First Amendment values.? ??
This is not to say that all boycotters are automatically free speech heroes; indeed, BDS advocates have themselves at times shut down Israeli academics or speakers to the detriment of academic freedom. Thus, it?s understandable that free speech advocates might not immediately identify BDS supporters as victims of censorship. But when government takes sides on a particular boycott and criminalizes those who engage in a boycott, it crosses a constitutional line. ?
Cardin and other supporters argue that the Israel Anti-Boycott Act targets only commercial activity. In fact, the bill threatens severe penalties against any business or individual who does not purchase goods from Israeli companies operating in the occupied Palestinian territories and who makes it clear ? say by posting on Twitter or Facebook ? that their reason for doing so is to support a U.N.- or E.U.-called boycott. That kind of penalty does not target commercial trade; it targets free speech and political beliefs. Indeed, the bill would prohibit even the act of giving information to a U.N. body about boycott activity directed at Israel. ?
The bill?s chilling effect would be dramatic ? and that is no doubt its very purpose. But individuals, not the government, should have the right to decide whether to support boycotts against practices they oppose. Neither individuals nor businesses should have to fear million-dollar penalties, years in prison and felony convictions for expressing their opinions through collective action. As an organization, we take no sides on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But regardless of the politics, we have and always will take a strong stand when government threatens our freedoms of speech and association. The First Amendment demands no less. ?

Treat a sore throat, don?t worry over it
	
?
Query: ?I am a 36-year-old woman suffering from what I believe is a bad case of sore throat. I find a painful and scratchy sensation in my throat. The pain worsens when I swallow or talk and I find it quite difficult to swallow. The back of my throat, especially my tonsils, seems to have swollen and is red in colour. My voice is hoarse when I speak. Though I am inclined to believe that this is a mere sore throat, what worries me is that I have been getting sore throats often as of late. And this time the sore throat is badly affecting me. I usually treat my sore throat without seeking medical help, thinking it isn?t a big issue. I gargle my throat with warm salt water and also use medicinal lozenges with the hope of reducing the soreness in my throat. I also drink a lot of hot water and tea when I get a sore throat. But these remedies seem to offer me temporary relief because I constantly develop a sore throat. I would like to know the cause for my sore throat. Is there a reason as to why I contract sore throats very often? Is it serious? Should I get my tonsils removed? And if so, will it permanently end my battle against sore throats??
(Manisha Perera?
from Kotte) ?
?

Reply: ?You are most definitely suffering from a sore throat. It?s nothing serious and it?s quite a common medical issue. The cause for your sore throat may have several possibilities. It could be either a bacterial or viral infection. Your sore throat could also be the result of an allergy. If the root to your sore throat problem is bacterial, antibiotics will help relieve your throat. If the sore throat is caused by a viral infection, then it will disappear on its own. If you are experiencing frequent sore throats, it may be due to a case of weak immunity. So what you should do is, consult your physician for medical treatment. Upon diagnosis of a bacterial infection, you will be prescribed with antibiotics. Frequent sore throat infections aren?t serious. The only concern here is that you have to make sure that you haven?t fallen victim to immuno-suppressive diseases, so I suggest you take a full blood count. As allergies could also result in sore throats, you should avoid cold water, ice- cream and such types of food. Always drink hot water. As for your question of having your tonsils removed, tonsil removal is an old treatment and isn?t performed at present. But your condition has no cause for worry.? ? ?

Tribute - Rohan Weeresinghe: A Friend and a ?Pen? Friend
	
I first met Rohan nearly 18 years ago at the chambers of our family dentist. We had both come without appointments and had to spend time. I realized that I was standing next to a well-built gentleman with a charming personality. Having exchanged smiles we realized that we were looking hard at each other?s pockets admiring the pens safely berthed. I broke the ice by stating that he is sporting the latest Dunhill AD 2000 and he responded by stating that he can spot the latest Parker Duofold in my pocket.
As the patients left , we sat and admired each other?s pens, wrote a few lines on sparsely populated advertisement of an ancient TIME Magazine. He mentioned that he obtained the pen from Singapore and I mentioned that I got mine as a gift from the Parker Company.
He was thrilled and said that he must then get to know me.
?
Rohan was one of the most knowledgeable persons whom I have met. He had a gentleman?s library worthy of admiration.
?
That was the birth of our friendship which grew day by day to the extent that by the time he left us forever, we used to take turns to call each other every day. True to the first day, we continued to write with each other?s pens and discuss our experiences to the much amusement of my wife.
Rohan hailed from a distinguished family, his father worked for International Agencies in Africa. He was educated at St. Joseph?s College after which he worked in the UK, before returning to Sri Lanka to work with Upali Wijewardene, founder Chairman of the GCEC, presently known as BOI.
I understand that Rohan played a pioneering role and immensely enjoyed that experience, in particular travelling with the great man in many countries. He married Dileeni also from a prominent family and they were blessed with a daughter, Shayani whom he adored so much. Rohan was one of the most knowledgeable persons whom I have met. He had a gentleman?s library worthy of admiration. Books covering a wide range of subjects such as, wildlife, photography, historic battles, armour, literature, arts, countries, cities, Sri Lankan maps and prints as well as others were methodically placed in teak book cases, reminding me of reading rooms in stately homes of England.
I was a privileged member of his library which was a part of his legacy to Shayani. At any given time he would be reading a few books in parallel. Rohan had rich tastes and to an extent a selective and knowledgeable collector. Whether it may be a Sri Lankan map or print, a vase, ancestral writing bureau or a Chinese wooden screen, he knew the history of his collections A to Z. It was a pleasure listening to him and exchanging views on these subjects, always with his perpetual smile, focused eyes, providing the best of description using minimum amount of words that too spoken softly.
Whenever I prepared an article to a pen magazine he had the first preview and I would always take on board his thoughtful comments.
Very recently we were preparing several joint manuscripts covering lesser known tales of pens and their manufacturers. He always encouraged me to find tales which were not in the public domain.
For example, the fate of the three highly precious Parker 75 pens with samples of lunar soil embedded in the barrel, taken by President Nixon as gifts on his historic visit to China, a great step for mankind in global diplomacy. Incidentally, Rohan?s first expensive pen purchased in England in the seventies was gold plated Parker 75.
He would have loved to have a coating of lunar soil on that pen!!! Over the last two months he was researching ?inks? and had downloaded more than 50 articles to prepare a manuscript.
He was fond of high quality notebooks and always had a pocket notebook and a pen in his pocket even when he was in hospital. I am happy that I was able to obtain a bottle of his favourite ink, the Pilot Yama- Budo made in Japan, fit for an emperor.
?
Rohan was very regular with the timing of his evening telephone call... She could not imagine that pens, ink and paper can generate so much of passionate interest and discussion among two adults.
?
During a recent visit to the UK, Dileeni surprised Rohan by bringing him the 90th Anniversary Rose Gold Montblanc LeGrand pen which he treasured so much.
A few weeks before he died he experimented with several inks and wrote specific sentences in a note book and gave me the task of monitoring the written pages every week to observe any discolouring using my special magnifying glass. This was not the first such task assigned to me. He will be happy to note that I am continuing his task with the same enthusiasm but without his reminders.
Both my wife Premini and I enjoyed the company of Rohan, Dileeni and Shayani. Rohan was very regular with the timing of his evening telephone call, and my wife would remind me to be ready for his call. She could not imagine that pens, ink and paper can generate so much of passionate interest and discussion among two adults. Rohan was a dear friend, a ?pen? friend and above all a very caring person who checked on me so frequently. He has left very happy and caring memories which we will treasure for life.
Our deepest sympathies are extended to Dileeni and Shayani.

Uniquely Sri Lankan: Not the usual travel book - Tracing Robert Knox?s escape route
	
At first glance, ?Uniquely Sri Lankan? might look like just another of that abundant crop of travel books on Sri Lanka. ??
But authors Siri Ipalwatte and Kim Wells have chosen their themes well, and have done their homework, and the result is a rewarding piece of reading accompanied by excellent photographs. ?
Siri Ipalwatte left Sri Lanka in the early 70s looking for better prospects in the UK. Kim Wells has often accompanied him to Sri Lanka over the years, and they share a passionate interest in the history of Robert Knox, the English sailor who was held captive in Kandy by King Rajasinghe II in the 17th century. ??
In fact, the story which traces Knox?s route during his escape to Dutch-held East is the first in a series of fourteen chapters, which explore various facets of Sri Lanka?s history and culture, ranging from the aadivasi community (the Veddahs) to the rituals of exorcism. ?
Traces Knox?s route during his escape to?Dutch-held East?
	Knox the English sailor was held in Kandy by King Rajasinghe II in the?17th century
	Exorcism explored without condescension and with awareness that ritual isn?t unique to Sri Lanka?
	This empathy with local tradition and psyche runs through the book
What sets it apart from the usual travel book is the reminiscing ? both writers recall earlier experiences while living and travelling in the island, which lends the writing a kind of depth lacking in a purely?contemporary account. ??
The second chapter titled ?Peddling to freedom? too, is an original piece of writing whereby Kim Wells traces the footsteps of the two English escapees ? Robert Knox and Stephen Rutland ? in their all-out bid for freedom, and the writer has literally done the leg work. This isn?t just a series of vistas seen through a?car window. ?
It?s a good detective story, too, as Knox didn?t leave behind a detailed map of his escape route. It is doubtful if Knox had seen any map of the island; in any case, 17th century maps of the island still left much to the imagination. It is good luck and ?dead reckoning? which got Knox and his partner to safety. The authors? passion for this particular historical incident can be felt through the illustrated account. As they say in their own words: ?Our own ?pursuit? of Robert Knox and Stephen Rutland had taken even our much-travelled driver into new territory and heightened our admiration for the resilience and resourcefulness of the two. Could we have done it? Maybe, but by now we have the excuse of the ages ? age itself and a predilection for comfort!?
Exorcism is a hackneyed theme in travel writing. But it is explored in this book without condescension, and with awareness that the ritual isn?t unique to Sri Lanka (a modern case from Australia is given).
What sets it apart from the usual travel book is the reminiscing ? both writers recall earlier experiences while living and travelling in the island, which lends the writing a kind of depth lacking in a purely contemporary account.??
The writers discuss the struggle of present-day practitioners to keep alive this ancient ritual, and offer a detailed account of an actual ceremony in the case of a possessed young woman. As they put it: ??
?Thovil is part of a holistic understanding that the physical condition of the body is inseparable from the mental condition. Modern ?common sense? might suggest that the practice we saw should by now have been relegated to oblivion; yet it is still alive and well and being defended, even in its extreme forms, as in the manslaughter case from Australia. The presence of a demonic spirit in the body is believed to override the physical body of the possessed and to control their every move. A sense that the yakka was truly present implicates all parties, not only yakkadura and the patient, but also spectators, as complicit in expelling the yakka from its human host.
?Before assuming that science is antipathetic to certain types of belief system, it is worth bearing in mind that medical science can now be used in modern ways to support such beliefs and rituals if that helps people?and communities.?
This empathy with local tradition and psyche runs through the book. In describing a visit to the ancient Buddhist shrine of Divaguhawa, the authors try to view the pilgrimage through the eyes and mind of a pilgrim ? in this case, an old woman clearly exhausted by the rigorous climb.
All in all, this a very intelligently written book, articulate, sympathetic though not sentimental, a visual and cerebral pleasure as far as both print and images are concerned.?
??Why risk your health by walking up to the top?? I asked her. ?
?Saman Deviyo will look after me,? smiled hopefully and took a drink from her water bottle. Then she said: ?You have to give before you can expect?to receive.? ?
The writers have the knack of describing the highlights of a place, or that crucial moment of a visit which lifts it above the ordinary, with simplicity and clarity. This is how sighting a leopard at Yala is described: ?Right there, 20 meters from us, a leopard was sitting yawning unperturbed by our presence. For about five minutes, one of the greatest leopard shows on earth took place right before my eyes. I fumbled with my camera to capture the moment, but also made sure to watch without looking through the lens.
?I wanted to remember this. It was the very best of Discovery Channel coming to me live and in 3D. For a minute or two it stared straight at us ? eyes locked on ours with the intense scrutiny of a supreme predator. And then, in a flash, he was gone. We stood there, stunned. I sat back, feeling a little drained ? sad, too. It was the briefest of encounters ? an exchange of glances that jolted the senses, seared the mind.? ?
Siri Ipalwatte strikes a personal note, heavy with nostalgia, in ?Coming home.? The southern fishing port and coastal town of Weligama is the location, last visited by him in 1978 when his father died. It?s a rambling narrative about change, childhood memories, and the culture, crafts and atmosphere of the place. Other chapters cover the cinnamon trade, wild elephants of Minneriya, the Jaffna peninsula, a drive along the East Coast, Sinharaja forest, the ancient monastery of Ritigala and vistas from Galle?to Dondra. ?
All in all, this a very intelligently written book, articulate, sympathetic though not sentimental, a visual and cerebral pleasure as far as both print and images are concerned. ??

Vallibel Finance records exceptional year  as income surpasses Rs.5 billion
	
Vallibel Finance PLC reported its strongest performance ever on the back of yet another impressive financial year with key indicators for the year 2016/2017 returning exceptional reading, firmly entrenching the company?s standing as the name-bearer of diversified Vallibel Group and a leading light of the finance industry.
?
Gross profits rose by a momentous 45.30 percent, crossing the one billion threshold reaching Rs.1.3 billion as against the previous year?s figure of Rs.911.0 million. The announcement comes in the wake of two global awards for the company from the Banking and Finance Review, capping an extraordinary year of highs.
?
?
Income, despite challenging times across markets, grew impressively, reaching Rs.5.0 billion. The increase in gross income marked a 47.5 percent increase over the previous year?s figure of 3.46 billion, further consolidating the company?s ability to steer through stormy waters.
Rising public confidence in Vallibel Finance was once again illustrated by deposits which amassed to Rs.17.8 billion from the previous year?s Rs.14.0 billion, a significant rise of 20.67 percent considering a highly competitive outlook in deposits mobilization.?
?
?The feeling on board the rising financial star is one of sheer ecstasy for two reasons. The public has once again showed its unbridled confidence in us as our annual report shows a year of unparalleled highs in the history of the company in which Vallibel Finance was also bestowed with international recognition, says Vallibel Finance Managing Director Jayantha Rangamuwa.
?
Crossing yet another milestone was the company?s asset base which leapfrogged to Rs.30.7 billion from Rs.22.8 billion in the previous financial year. ?The 34.8 percent growth in this key indicator mutes testimony to a new-age financial tradition in the making. The figures go on to show that people across Sri Lanka have endorsed the company?s refreshingly unique brand of financial stewardship.
?
?A truly triumphant year, indeed for Vallibel Finance! ?To record its best ever performance and to walk away with two prestigious global awards are laurels that make the entire group proud of its name-barer. I note with pride how Sri Lankans across the land have placed their trust in a company with a relatively short history. That?s financial stewardship of the highest order?, says Vallibel Group Executive Director and Founder Chairman Dhammika Perera.
?
The lending portfolio increased by 34.8 percent to Rs.24.7 billion in the financial year 2016/17, as against the previous year?s Rs.18 billion. Four new branches opened during the financial year as the company continues to take measured steps as it steers forward in a challenging market.
?
A decade of success highlights the company?s ability to leverage on innovation in crafting financial products for all sectors of the economy including those marginalized and that means threading off the beaten-track in order to net in a wider section of society into financial inclusion.
?
Continuous impressive performance and global recognition make the company?s 10th year anniversary all the more momentous, illustrating just what it means for a relatively young finance company to emerge as a trailblazer. Vallibel Finance has also been listed in LMD?s leading 100 brands in Sri Lanka. ?
?
?For our customers, our stakeholders and our staff, there?s every reason to be jubilant as the new financial star of Sri Lanka looks set greater vistas?, avers Rangamuwa while also pointing to the company?s acumen and commitment in clocking consistently impressive performance, year on year, bearing good news to its customers and stakeholders even during challenging ?times.
