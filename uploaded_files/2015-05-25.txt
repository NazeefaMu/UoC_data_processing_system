Asian Alliance Insurance posts Rs.250mn profit in 1Q
	
Reinforcing its status as one of the country?s fastest growing insurers, Asian Alliance Insurance PLC achieved a gross written premium (GWP) of Rs.867 million for life, a 21 percent increase compared with the previous year, whilst the consolidated group premiums that included general insurance, were recorded at Rs.1,317 million for the first quarter of the 2015 financial year. Profit after tax for the period was Rs.251 million for the company and the group profit was Rs.200 million.?
The Asian Alliance brand has gained considerable momentum over the past months and is being driven on the platform of innovation with value and customer convenience being foremost in mind. The company has stepped up the intensity of its operations with a number of industry firsts in its life business. Higher non-medical and financial underwriting limits have been provided to top sales advisors based on certain parameters whilst non-medical straight forward businesses are underwritten and processed on a straight-through basis, utilising the robustness of the company?s proprietary IT system.?
Self-service insurance facilities that are linked to kiosks are being rolled out to branches to enable sales advisors and even customers to carry out their requirements without depending on any office staff, at their own convenience and on their own time. The general insurance business launched a revolution in the motor industry with the most innovative Click2Claim product that delivers the fastest claim settlement in the market, whilst eliminating the hassle and inconvenience that follows a motor accident.?
The product is receiving rave reviews and has picked up strongly, enabling considerable operational convenience and cost efficiencies that are at the centre of the new GI strategy that is being executed with a strong focus.
?The growth in the life insurance business in particular is a strong endorsement that reflects the success of Asian Alliance Insurance PLC?s innovation-driven strategy,? Asian Alliance Insurance PLC Chairman Ashok Pathirage said. ?This performance is especially noteworthy, considering that this comes during a challenging period ? the first financial quarter since the segregation of life and general insurance segments. With increasing life insurance penetration being a pressing national need, the rapid increase in gross written premium of life insurance is particularly heartening.?
?With continuous investment in staff, as well as introduction of cutting-edge solutions such as self-service insurance and a number of industry first moves, Asian Alliance Insurance has laid a solid foundation not only for short but more importantly for long-term growth,? Asian Alliance Insurance PLC Managing Director Iftikar Ahamed said. ?We are confident that this will increasingly reflect in our future financial performance.??

CRIB celebrates silver jubilee
	
By Zahara Haris
The Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka (CRIB) celebrated its 25th anniversary prestigiously by recognising and felicitating the people who played a significant role throughout the years.?
To mark the event, the first-ever newsletter ?CRIB and CREDIT? compiled by the staff of the CRIB was issued and the first copy was presented to Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran, who was the chief guest at the event.?
CRIB Sri Lanka, the first in South Asia, was established in 1990 and was formed by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and the Finance Ministry by an Act of Parliament as a response to the 1980s? debt crisis in the country. The CRIB, which plays a crucial role in developing a vibrant financial system in Sri Lanka, also plays a vital role in the realm of credit risk management and to promote a healthy credit culture in the country. Addressing the gathering, Mahendran said that it is important to involve Sri Lankans working overseas to the credit evaluation system in Sri Lanka.
?We should perhaps bring Sri Lankans working overseas into our credit evaluation system because to me it seems the remittances that come from overseas are a very valuable financing opportunity, which will help us to develop the country.? He said that this is a linkage the CRIB should exploit on how to use the savings coming from offshore. CRIB Chairman Ananda Silva said that the CRIB has contributed to reshape the credit culture in the country and has played a vital role in facilitating financial institutions over the past two and a half decades. ??The CRIB has always tried to maintain accuracy and timeliness in providing credit information and at the same time ensure confidentiality of data submitted by bank and non-bank financial institutions. In fact, the CRIB has contributed to reshape the credit culture in the country,? he said. The CRIB is a public-private partnership, with the Central Bank holding the majority of equity, while the rest is held by lending institutions regulated by the Central Bank. ?Several banks and institutions won awards at the ceremony and it concluded with the Annual General Meeting, which was attended by CEOs and compliance officers of stakeholder institutions.

Excise busted liquor racket by embassy driver
	
A major racket involving the selling of selling foreign liquor at Rosmead Place by the embassy of an Asian country was busted when the Excise Department seized 100 bottles of foreign liquor worth over Rs.400, 000 yesterday.
The Excise Bureau of Special Operations had been informed that a driver attached to the particular diplomatic mission had been engaged in selling foreign liquor taking advantage of the privileges enjoyed by the embassy.
Excise Superintendent Excise Rohan Wijeratne of the BSO said that they sent a decoy to order and purchase a stock of liquor at an arranged price and he had been asked by the staff driver to come and collect it from the embassy premises.
The Excise sleuths however had arranged to make the deal outside the embassy premises and the driver had brought the liquor out of the embassy premises in a van.
The driver was taken into custody as he was transacting the deal with the decoy. The Excise officers had found 100 one litre bottles of Sir Edward whisky worth Rs.4,000 each.
Further interrogation revealed that the driver had been engaged in this racket for a long time buying large quantities of liquor at the duty free rates granted to diplomatic missions using fake invoices
He had then sold the liquor at high prices from the embassy premises taking advantage of the fact that the Excise officers could not make arrests within the embassy premises.
OIC T. B. Sarap of the Excise BSO, Excise Inspector Buddika, Excise Guards Anura,, Dhanajaya, Premaratne, Aravinda, Rodrigo and Jayantha made the arrest on the instructions of Excise Commissioner General L K G Gunawardena, Deputy Excise Commissioner Pushpakumara Silva and Assistant Excise Commissioner Nimal Silva.
The driver was produced before Maligakanda Magistrate yesterday and fined Rs.50, 000 and the vehicle used to transport the liquor was taken into custody.
The Excise Department is to inform the embassy officials about the incident. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

Fitch revises PABC?s outlook to negative; affirms at ?BBB(lka)?
	
		 		 
		 
			
Fitch Ratings Lanka has revised Sri Lanka-based Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC?s (PABC) outlook to negative from stable. The agency has affirmed PABC?s National Long-Term Rating at ?BBB(lka)? and the rating on PABC?s outstanding subordinated debentures at ?BBB-(lka)?.
The negative outlook reflects the continued deterioration in PABC?s capitalisation amid aggressive loan growth. Fitch believes there is a high chance that the bank will not be able to materially increase its capital ratio during 2H15, which would result in a downgrade.
PABC?s weak capitalisation amid rapid loan book growth has become the most important rating driver. The rating also takes into account the bank?s weak asset quality relative to higher rated peers and moderate franchise.
PABC?s loan book increased by 9.1 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) in 1Q15 following growth of 27 percent in 2014, which was above the industry average. The expansion was driven by increased focus on retail and small and medium enterprise (SME) customers. Fitch expects PABC to continue to grow faster than its peers.
Fitch sees a high risk that PABC will not meet the Central Bank of Sri Lanka?s minimum Tier I capital target of Rs.10 billion for licensed commercial banks by January 1, 2016. PABC?s Tier I capital unadjusted for deductions stood at Rs.4.5bn at end-March 2015. Fitch will closely monitor how PABC positions itself to meet this requirement. The bank?s Fitch core capital ratio declined to 8.6 percent as at end-1Q15 from 9.5 percent at end-2014 and 10.1 percent at end-2013.
PABC?s asset quality remains significantly weaker than the industry average, with a reported gross non-performing loan ratio of 6.4 percent at end-1Q15 after a slight improvement to 5.7 percent at end-2014 from 8 percent at end-2013 as a result of lower exposure to pawning. Fitch is of the view that the bank?s aggressive loan growth with greater exposure to retail and SME customer segments, which are more susceptible to economic conditions, could exert pressure on its asset quality.
PABC?s profitability improved, with return on assets of 0.9 percent in 1Q15 compared with 0.6 percent in 2014 and 0.2 percent in 2014. This was largely due to higher net interest margins stemming from re-pricing of deposits and an increase in the current and savings account (CASA) base to 31 percent of total deposits as at end-1Q15 from 19 percent at end-2013. PABC will likely find it challenging to maintain a strong CASA base due to its small but slowly expanding franchise. This, alongside Fitch?s expectation of continued high impairment charges, could continue to put pressure on profitability.

New security plan before year-end: Ruwan
	
	State Minister of Defence, Ruwan Wijewardene told Daily Mirror today that a new National Security Plan would be in place before the end of this year and that it was being prepared by the three service commanders and the police chief.
	When asked whether Sri Lanka would obtain strategic inputs from foreign powers like the US and India and other friendly countries who have closely cooperated with Sri Lanka in defence-related matters, the state minister said this matter was discussed at National Security Council meetings but a final decision in this regard was yet to be taken.
	Meanwhile, President Maithripala Sirisena has instructed the National Security Council to formulate a new National Security Plan based on the current security needs of the country with the main objective of preventing another armed uprising in the country.
	After an inspection tour of the Security Forces' Headquarters at Welikanda yesterday, President Sirisena told the security forces personnel that attention would be focused on regional and national security when preparing the new security plan.
	He said it would be prepared taking into account scientific and technological know-how and assured that terrorists and terrorism would never be allowed to hamper the country?s progress again.
	?We have a lot of respect and gratitude for our war heroes, who lost life and limb in rescuing Sri Lanka from the clutches of terrorism. The new Government places its highest priority on the country?s security. Terrorism was eradicated mainly because of the discipline and commitment of the security forces personnel,? the President said. "Our security forces are highly appreciated and highly rated internationally and that is why they have been chosen to serve in the United Nations Peacekeeping Force.
	The President vowed to do everything possible for the welfare of the security forces personnel, who safeguarded the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
	President Sirisena once again underscored the fact that he was not a king but a servant leader of the people.
	The President Sirisena was greeted by Army Commander Crishantha de Silva and other high ranking officers on the arrival at Welikanda Security Forces Headquarters. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Police remove Prabhakaran hoardings in Tiruchy
	
Tension prevailed for a while at different places in the city in the wee hours of Sunday, when a group of volunteers of the Naam Tamilar Katchi objected to the police action of removing the party?s flex hoardings, carrying the portraits of the banned LTTE chief Velupillai Prabhakaran, erected by them in Tiruchy.
The flex hoardings were erected in connection with the party?s state conference being held on Sunday evening at suburban Panchapur in which the party?s founder Seeman and others are scheduled to speak.??? ?
Police told the agitators that they were removing only the unauthorised flex hoardings and not those hoardings, which were put up with permission. After this, the agitators dispersed peacefully. A later report said that vehicular traffic on the busy Pudukkottai-Rameswaram National highway was paralysed for about an hour as a section of volunteers of ?Naam Tamilar Katchi? blocked the road by parking their vehicles near the NHAI?s toll plaza at Thirumayam, refusing to pay toll on Sunday.

Ranil trying to cover-up bond scandal: GL
	
UPFA MP G.L. Peiris today claimed that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was attempting to cover up February?s controversial sale of Central Bank (CB) Bonds by alleging that Rs.2.7 trillion worth Bonds had been sold during the tenure of the previous government by violating CB regulations.
?The Prime Minister should have informed parliament if there were any irregularities when auctioning Central Bank Bonds during the previous government because he was then the opposition leader. He had a responsibility to raise these matters in parliament,? Mr. Peiris told a news conference held at the Abhayaramaya in Colombo.
He said the Prime Minister should take the responsibility for appointing Arjuna Mahendran as CB Governor and the sale of treasury bonds and added that there was no credibility in the committee appointed by the Prime Minister to inquire into this matter.
He said the committee had ruled that certain matters needed to be clarified but the Prime Minister had ignored this and allowed Mr. Mahendran to continue as CB Governor. ?The government deliberately postponed the debate on the no-confidence motion against Mr. Mahendran,? he said.
Meanwhile, provincial councillor Udaya Gammanpila urged the Premier to reveal the details of the frauds committed when auctioning CB Bonds during the previous regime and requested the President to appoint an impartial committee to look into sale of the CB bonds. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Two Anunayake Theras appointed after 162 years
	
After a lapse of 162 years, two Anunayake Theras were appointed to the Asgiriya Chapter by the Karaka Sangha Sabha led by Asgiriya Mahanayake Most Ven. Galagama Attadassi Thera.
The election was held at the Asgiri Historic Poyage this afternoon, presided over by the Asgiriya Chapter Mahanayake Thera.
The 18-member Karaka Sangha Sabha elected uncontested Ven. Panditha Wendurawe Upali Thera- Trustee of the Historic Polonnaruwa Solosmastana and Ven. Panditha Warakagoda Gunaratna Thera - Trustee of the Historic Muthiyangane Raja Maha Viharaya.
This election of the two Anunayakes was done away with by the British when they found that the Anunayake of the Sath Korale who held the last appointment was against the British. They did not appoint a Anunayke thereafter since all these appointments to the two Maha Vihara's were done by them until 1853.
However, the newly elected Mahanayake Thera of the Asgiriya re-introduced the appointment of the two Anunayake Theras to the Asgiriya chapter. (L.B.Senaratne)
