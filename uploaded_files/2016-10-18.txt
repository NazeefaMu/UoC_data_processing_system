Adhil Bakeer Markar?s death not suspicious: Scotland Yard
	
The Scotland Yard is treating the death of Adhil Bakeer Markar, son of Imthiaz Bakeer Markar, as unexplained but not suspicious, the London Evening Standard reported.
Adhil, a member of one of Sri Lanka?s most prominent political families was found dead in his room at a London university shortly after going to bed complaining of a fever.
Friends who became worried when Adhil Bakeer Markar failed to answer phone calls battered down the door of his London School of Economics dorm to find him lying unconscious. They tried to resuscitate him but he was pronounced dead at the scene from a suspected heart attack.
Scotland Yard is treating the death, just before 1pm last Wednesday, as unexplained but not suspicious.
Mr Bakeer Marker, 25, had been tipped as a future head of his nation. He was studying for masters in politics after winning a prestigious Chevening scholarship, designed to give future leaders from around the Commonwealth the chance to study in Britain.
Adhil?s brother said he sent a message to relatives saying he had a slight fever.
Azam said: ?He sent a message to his niece saying he had a slight fever, but he will be ok, god willing, and asked if she was having fun with the new cousin. My other brother?s wife had just given birth the day before.?
In his final Facebook post last week he said he had achieved his childhood dream of playing cricket at Lord?s, in trials for the university team.
Dr Rayes Musthafa, a paediatrician and family friend, said he was at work in the Harley Street Clinic when he was asked to check on Mr Bakeer Markar by concerned relatives.
He found the popular student?s friends and a lecturer in the room at Sidney Webb Halls in Great Dover Street, Southwark.
He said: ?I saw his body on the floor. His roommates had put him on the ground to perform CPR but it had failed. It was very shocking to everyone. Nobody expects a 25-year-old to die as suddenly as that.
?He had earlier complained of a slight fever and said he was going to take paracetamol. It wasn?t a big thing, his death was so sudden. I broke the news to his family on speakerphone from his room, they are devastated. Nobody knows how he died but they think it?s a heart attack.?
Mr Musthafa said he had been ?very active and dynamic. He wasn?t a politician yet but was growing into one, many spoke of him as a future leader of Sri Lanka. He was humble, down-to-earth. He had posted a message to his family?s WhatsApp group asking to come home, it was his last message?.
In 2013, Mr Bakeer Markar ? whose late grandfather was speaker of parliament ? delivered a passionate speech at the UN urging the island?s youth to build bridges between their communities and ?heal the scars? of civil war.
LSE?s government department has set up a blog page where friends can leave memories and messages of sympathy. Youth charity IVolunteer and the LSE Islamic Society, which the student had been active in, paid tribute to him.
Damith Senanyake, a former classmate in Colombo, wrote: ?It is a tragedy that we lost this great man so soon.?

Don't change provisions on NF, NA, Buddhism: JO
	
In its proposals to the Steering Committee on Constitutional Reforms, the joint opposition (JO) has said the constitutional provisions on matters such as the National Flag (NF) and National Anthem (NA)and the status accorded to Buddhism should in no way be compromised.
The JO states that sovereignty rested in the people and was inalienable according to the current constitution and should be retained unchanged. It said the Territory of the Republic as in Article 5 of the 1978 Constitution should be preserved.
JO parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardane, who is a member of the Steering Committee. has together with MP Prasanna Gunawardane signed the document outlining the proposals.
The proposals state that the amalgamation of provinces should not be allowed under any circumstance and the Prime Minister should be elected by Parliament while the Leader of the Opposition has to be elected by parliamentarians in the Opposition.
The JO has called for the enhancing of the list of subjects of the local authorities and that the provincial council system should not endanger the unitary state and its security with provincial councils exercising their powers subject to the executive and legislative powers of the centre.

Draft of National Trade Policy given to GMOA
	
A draft of the much-awaited National Trade Policy had been given yesterday to the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) for their opinion, by International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama.
Calling a media conference at GMOA Head Quarters, Colombo, GMOA Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda said they were in receipt of the draft and that they had been asked to give opinion.
The members of the GMOA, who were surprised to have witnessed the draft of National Trade Policy as the first professional body, have asked more time from Minister Samarawickrama to study its pros and cons in order to present their stance on the draft.
The draft, formulated by a seven-member committee headed by international economist Dr. Ravi Ratnayake, provides a strategic trade policy framework for Sri Lanka, made from modern trade theory, new global trading environment and experiences of the countries that used trade as an engine of growth, development priorities.
It also outlined the economic agenda of the new government, availability of resources and socio-economic conditions of Sri Lanka, a set of sound trade policy principles, policy instruments, criteria for entering into trade agreements, the process and guidelines for policy and institutional coherence as well as an implementation plan with a set of immediate actions, the source said.
Dr. Ananda claimed that the draft was formulated by the same group of professionals, who were involved in drafting the ?loss-making? Indo-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (ISFTA) and they had no accountability and responsibility in the proper implementation of the national trade policy.
?Therefore, we propose Minister Malik Samarawickrama to appoint a Presidential Commission to constantly monitor the implementation of the National Trade Policy. He agreed with us and assured that he would inform President Maithripala Sirisena to take necessary steps,? he said. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Giant of the skies finally comes home
	
An American plane flown by Soviet forces during the Second World War could one day fly again, after it was crash landed in Siberia in 1947.
Captain Maxim Tyurikov brought the plane down after encountering stormy weather and amazingly, there were no casualties among the 32 passengers on board.
But nine people, including the captain and two crew members, died as they trekked through icy conditions to find the nearest settlement and rescue the other passengers.
Now, the wreckage of the Douglas C-47 is to be recovered in a joint Russian and American expedition and examined in the hope it could be restored to its former glory and flown again.
Part of the wreckage includes a message written in indelible ink by the captain, explaining when he took off, crashed, and that there were no casualties. (dailymail)

An opposition Diyawanna member had recently made representations to a top white-collar one at the august assembly on behalf of a group of employees who over the years had been deprived of salary increments and promotions.?
?
The white collar high-up had responded that the fact that employees were stagnating on the same salary and the same post for years did not surprise him because he himself was being underpaid and he had failed so far to get those responsible to place him on the proper salary stage.
?My predecessor had been drawing a monthly salary of Rs.94,000. But what I am receiving is a pay much lower than that,? he had added.
By the way, the opposition member had also pointed out to the high-up that the officers in higher grades had been granted higher pay in the recent past while unjustly denying those in minor grades a simultaneous upward pay revision.

The National Freedom Front (NFF) today asked the Inspector General of Police (IGP) to resign from his post because he was the one who was responsible for politicizing the independent institutions including the CID, FCID and the Bribery Commission.
NFF media spokesman Mohammed Muzammil told a media briefing that the President?s statement made on Wednesday had proved that these institutions were working to a political agenda.
?There is no use of the National Police Commission if the FCID is functioning to satisfy various political forces. These so called independent institutions are not functioning in an independent manner. Therefore, the IGP should resign from his post as he had failed to fulfill his responsibility,? said Mr. Muzammil. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

President' statement twisted by trouble makers: Minister
	
President Maithripala Sirisena has no intention of abolishing or disrupting the investigations being carried out by the independent commissions, Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said yesterday.
He said this when referring to the President's statement in which he was reported to have said last Wednesday that he would have to take action if the independent commissions were functioning based on a political agenda.
The minister told those gathered at the ?Kethaka Aruna? agricultural ceremony held in Kalutara that the President's statement only intended safeguarding the war heroes who had sacrificed their lives to protect this country.
?Several political parties have attempted to distort the contents of the statement to satisfy the opposing political elements. Even some media institutions have misinterpreted his statement,? he said.
The minister said the President and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe?s motive was to spread democracy throughout the country by stabilizing its economic, political and social standards and pointed out that allegations made made against the President that he was planning to take action against the CID, FCID and Bribery Commission was just a conspiracy by mischievous elements.

The NCCP supplies 900 megawatts to the national grid. All three power plants came to a standstill last Saturday as a result of a breakdown which led to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) imposing a 90-minute power cut countrywide except in the Colombo City, industrial areas and hospitals.

Sri Lanka ranks 87th in Hunger Index
	
Sri Lanka ranked 87th among developing countries in the Global Hunger index indicating the country had some levels of poverty and malnutrition to combat.
The Index which took into account 118 developing countries, ranked three of Sri Lanka?s neighbours in lower ranks. Among the South Asian countries India ranked 97 with Afghanistan and Pakistan bringing in the rear.
The GHI is calculated by taking into account four key parameters: shares of undernourished population, wasted and stunted children aged under 5, and infant mortality rate of the same age group.
Of the 131 countries studied, data was available for 118 countries. This year, for the first time, two measures of child hunger -wasting and stunting -have been used to give a more complete picture. Wasting refers to low weight in relation to a child's height, reflecting acute under nutrition. Stunting refers to the deficiency in height in relation to age, reflecting chronic under nutrition.
The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) makes the annual calculations of GHI. Basing its readings on the most recent data, the 2016 GHI for India was derived from the fact that an estimated 15% population is undernourished -lacking in adequate food intake, both in quantity and quality.
Overall, global hunger levels are down by about 29% compared to 2000.Twenty countries, including Rwanda, Cambodia, and Myanmar, have reduced their GHI scores by over 50% each since 2000. And, for the second year in a row, no developing country for which data was available featured in the "extremely alarming" category.

The guest of honour became an unwitting impediment
	
?
An unusual incident where the guest of honour had to walk out to enable starting a stalled session of a workshop held exclusively for a select group of women participants, has been reported from a gem-rich area in the country.?
?
The guest of honour, a young handsome deputy purohita had tea with the participants following the inaugural session. About 100 fair participants present were in a jovial mood and the young purohita soon became the centre of their attraction. ?One of them took a selfie or two with the young politico and that set the ball rolling. All participants were soon seen falling over one another in an endless bid to take selfies with the politico.?
The time set apart for the tea recess had ticked away and the young deputy purohita, now a virtual prisoner of the participants was still posing for the selfies being taken by them.
Several requests made to the women to go back to their seats for the second session fell on deaf ears. Realizing that the selfie-mad participants would not let go of the young politico so long as he was present, the organizers made a kind request to the latter to walk out of the hall for a while. ?
The participants rushed back to their seats as their guest of honour walked out, they say. ??
