ACPBA wants closure of SLTB
	
All Ceylon Private Bus Association (ACPBA) Secretary Anjana Priyanjith today requested the government to terminate the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) service due to the colossal waste of tax money of the people per year.
He said they have the ability to operate private bus service better than the SLTB by providing more facilities to commuters.
?After closing the SLTB, the government should take steps to acquire private buses to SLTB. That will help the government to save Rs.1,350 million per month which would be used to maintain the SLTB,? he said.
Meanwhile, he said the Transport Ministry had decided to import 2,000 buses with the intention of providing a better service to the people by using the recent countrywide bus strike as the reason, he said.
?It is clear that there is an excess of 3,000 private buses in the country. Therefore, the government can use these buses to provide more facilities to the people in a certain procedure. The Minister has no right to import buses to the country. The Ministry had taken this in a manner of destroying the private bus service and its employees,? he said.
However, if the minister is trying to do so, we cannot let it happen and the minister would have to face bitter experiences, he said. ?We will not let the minister to destroy the private bus service in the country,? he said.
Meanwhile, the ACPBA requested the minister to operate the private and CTB buses under a joint time schedule.
By assigning the joint time table there would be no need to have races with SLTB buses and that would also help to minimize the roadside accidents, Mr. Priyanjith said.
This government has the responsibility to operate the SLTB and private buses in a joint time table to provide a good service to the people in the country, he added. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Changing fate of transgenders
	
?
Imagine you wake up one morning and find yourself in the body of the other sex and you will have to live the rest of your life as that gender. How would you feel? Some transgenders who are wealthy, take hormones to alter their sex or undergo sex reassignment surgery. Their purpose is to get rid of the miserable feelings they have to deal in their lives. It is a relief for them to get their sex changed through surgery or by taking hormone pills. But, what about those not financially able to buy hormone pills or undergo surgery? ?
?
Sexual orientation is largely by genetics and not choice, a groundbreaking 2014 study in the Journal Psychological Medicine published by Cambridge University Press stated. ??
This undermines the major argument against lesbian, bisexual, gay, transgender, and intersex (LBGTI) community claims its members are choosing to live ?unnaturally.? Regardless of genetic preference, genes are only a factor in the larger picture, taking into account social and cultural pressures that can affect an individual?s sexual lifestyle.
?
The attributes, opportunities and relationships associated with being male and female are socially constructed. As such, responsibilities assigned and activities undertaken are different and unequal for men and women. Most transgenders rejected by their biological parents, lack formal education and therefore, they fail to find a job. As a result, many have to beg and some do sex work for their livelihoods. ?
?
Effort to lift the marginalised from despair
?
One year ago, a group of Indian transgenders headed by transgender activist Vijayaraja Mallika started work on a project aiming to build a school for school- dropout transgenders to lift their community from despair. Their dream became a reality. The learning center for school-dropout transgenders received immense support from state politicians after being inspired by a landmark judgment in 2015 given by the Supreme Court of India, recognising the transsexual community as a ?third gender? in 2015. ?The judgment legally recognised the transgender community that had been abandoned by society for a long time. The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill was also brought in 2016 by the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment, Government of India, for the inclusion of the transgender community in society. ?
Indian transgender activist Kalki Subramanium and other distinguished guests are pictured at the Sahaj International School?s inauguration in Kochi.?
Opening of India?s first transgender school
?
Encouraged by the developments, ?Sahaj International School? -India?s first residential school for transgenders opened on December 30, 2016 in Kochi, Kerala. The inauguration ceremony was held at Jyothis Bhavan in Kakkanad, Kochi under the patronage of the District Collector of Ernakulam K. Mohammed Y. Safirulla and present was prominent Indian transgender activist and artist Kalki Subramanium. Delivering her speech, Ms. Kalki Subramanium said the most important tool for any marginalised community to stand tall in society is education, because it gives light, knowledge and confidence leading to a beautiful life. ?Ms. Subramanium said the opening of the school would be an example to other Indian states to support the transgender community by creating a social status for them through education. ?
?
Meanwhile, Vijayaraja Mallika clarified the school would initially accommodate 10 transgenders between 25 and 50 years old who had dropped out of school. ?Their studies will be done under the National Open School system. In addition, they will be given training in life skills and personality development. Their teachers also belong to the transgender community,? she said. ?
?
?Vijayaraja Mallika who mooted the idea for the school pictured with transwomen Maya Menon and Faisal CK
?
India, not the first country adopted policy for transgenders
?
According to a survey carried out by Department of Social Justice and Empowerment, which comes under the Social Justice and Empowerment Ministry, India there are more than 25, 000 transgenders in Kerala state. The survey has found that of the 25,000 transgender people in Kerala, 58% could not complete school education because of sexuality identity difficulties. ?
?
Kerala became the first Indian state to adopt a policy for transgenders. The initiative for the school for education of transgenders will encourage the country and the world to consider giving equal rights to not only transgenders but also the entire LGBTI people. However, India was not the first country to legally recognise a third gender. Nepal recognised a third gender in 2007 and Bangladesh in 2013. ?

Trans-sexual people?s rights not protected by existing Sri Lankan laws: HRW
?
When it comes to Sri Lanka, a country with a patriarchal social system, gender equality, though controversial, is a goal for which Sri Lankan LGBTI people are fighting. Sri Lankan law provides no clear path to changing one?s gender legally, but gender recognition procedure is currently under consideration. A report issued by the Human Rights Watch (HRW) last year on violence and discrimination experienced by Sri Lankan transgender people also reaffirmed it.
?
The report based on interviews that HRW conducted between October 2015 and January 2016 in four Sri Lankan cities with 61 LGBTI people states transsexual people?s rights are not protected by existing Sri Lankan laws. The report calls for the Sri Lankan Parliament to repeal Sections 365 and 365A of the Sri Lankan Penal Code, which criminalises same-sex relations between consenting adults, and the Vagrants? Ordinance, which could be used to criminalise transgender people and sex workers. It also recommends to pass comprehensive, anti-discrimination legislation prohibiting discrimination, including on grounds of gender identity and sexual orientation, and enacting effective measures to identify, respond and prevent such discrimination. ?
Giving equal rights ?to them is a victory for good governance: Dr. Mahim Mendis
?
Even though HRW and other international human rights organisations recommend new regulations to be implemented for the welfare of Sri Lankan LGBTI people, especially transgenders, will this be possible? The question arises as a considerable number of Sri Lankans believe that women and men should look and act according to ?normal? sexual identities.
?
Discussing this controversial topic, former the Dean of the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences of the Open University of Sri Lanka and Senior Lecturer Dr. Mahim Mendis said that it was time that Sri Lanka had legislation safeguarding LGBTI people?s rights in Sri Lanka. ??
?It is time this country moves swiftly towards progressive legislation eliminating all forms of discrimination. ?
?
?It is the obligation of the State to ensure that all categories of people are treated equally and this obviously includes transgenders. Human ignorance should not be allowed to play havoc in the lives of people. Furthermore, the young and the old should be educated on these issues as they haven?t got the capacity to empathise with people who are not like them. These include those in high positions, due to our bankrupt education system. It will be a victory for good governance to see more and more LGBTI people given their rightful places,? he said. ? ??

Faisal: female trapped in male body
?
Faisal who is from Thrissur, Kerala was born a male, but when he became a teenager, he realised he has feminine characterists. He started wearing jewelry, letting his hair grown, using makeup and wearing colorful feminine clothes. He wanted him to be treated as a woman trapped in a male body.
Though he tried to ?hide? his masculine features, he was identified as a male by society. He was subjected to discrimination by his own family members and at school. He was told by his family members as he had been born a man, he should live as one. ?
?After I started living as a woman, my family rejected me. My siblings said I was no longer their brother,? Faisal said. Because of ?unbearable? discrimination at school, he stopped his education at class 5.
?
He was finally thrown by family at age 14 and lived on the street. He had no option, but earn a living as a sex worker. ?
?
"After I started living as a woman, my family rejected me. My siblings said I was no longer their brother,? Faisal said. Because of ?unbearable? discrimination at school, he stopped her education at class 5. He was finally thrown by family at age 14 and lived on the street. He had no option, but earn a living as a sex worker. "
?
He said he felt he would commit suicide as his life was miserable. However, he met many other transgender women. Until then, he was not even aware of a community called transgenders. ?Meeting them made a great impact on my life. I too joined them to work for the rights of people like me. The goal of my life is to work not only for transgenders but also every part of the community deprived of their rights,? he said. ? Faisal is an inspirational personality engaged in social activism against human rights violations. ?I want to give my contribution to make a better India,? he said.
?
He said as he became a known personality in the country as a gender activist, his family had contacted him and expressed their willingness to renew their relations. Describing the status of transgenders? status in society in most South Asian countries, he said the topic is a social taboo. But, he added their expectations have been raised that the steps taken by the Indian government and the judiciary to uphold the rights of the transgender community.

Deutsche Bank to pay US $95 million to end U.S. tax fraud case
	
?
REUTERS: Deutsche Bank AG agreed to pay US $95 million to resolve a U.S. government lawsuit accusing the German bank of tax fraud for using ?insolvent? shell companies to hide significant tax liabilities from the Internal Revenue Service in 2000.
Under the accord described in papers filed on Wednesday with the federal court in Manhattan, Deutsche Bank also admitted to trying to stick the shell companies with the tax bill for its then-new stake in drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.
The settlement resolves a lawsuit filed in December 2014 that had sought to recoup more than us $190 million in taxes, penalties and interest.
?The government, through this action and settlement, has made Deutsche Bank admit to its actions designed to avoid taxes,? U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan said in a statement.
Deutsche Bank spokeswoman Amanda Williams said in a statement: ?We are pleased to resolve this claim and put these events from more than 16 years ago behind us.?
The settlement marks the latest step in Deutsche Bank?s bid to resolve legal matters that in recent months caused investors to worry about its future, and whether it had enough capital.
Last month, Deutsche Bank reached a us $7.2 billion settlement in principle to resolve a U.S. probe of its sale of toxic mortgage securities.
The tax case arose from Deutsche Bank?s early 2000 acquisition of Charter Corp, which had been sitting on a large unrealized gain in Bristol-Myers.
According to settlement papers, the bank in May 2000 sold Charter to the shell companies, which then liquidated Charter and sold the Bristol-Myers shares back to the bank, triggering a more than us $52 million tax liability.
But the shell companies lacked the funds to pay the taxes, and Deutsche Bank admitted that it knew or should have known this was the case, the papers said.
?Deutsche Bank engaged in the May 2000 transaction in order to avoid having to pay the built-in tax liability,? the papers said.
The case is U.S. v Deutsche Bank AG et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 14-09669.

North Korea says can test-launch ICBM at any time

REUTERS, 08th JANUARY, 2017-North Korea said on Sunday it can test launch an intercontinental ballistic missile at any time from any location set by leader Kim Jong Un, saying the United States? hostile policy was to blame for its arms development.
Kim said on Jan. 1 that his nuclear-capable country was close to test-launching an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).
?The ICBM will be launched anytime and anywhere determined by the supreme headquarters of the DPRK,? an unnamed Foreign Ministry spokesman was quoted as saying by the official KCNA news agency, using the acronym for the country?s name.
The North is formally known as the Democratic People?s Republic of Korea.
The United States said on Thursday that North Korea had demonstrated a ?qualitative? improvement in its nuclear and missile capabilities after an unprecedented level of tests last year.
Experts have said that while North Korea may be close to testing an ICBM, it would likely take years to perfect the weapon.
Once fully developed, a North Korean ICBM could threaten the continental United States, which is around 9,000 km (5,500 miles) from the North. ICBMs have a minimum range of about 5,500 km (3,400 miles), but some are designed to travel 10,000 km (6,200 miles) or further.

?It has taken every effort to mitigate inconvenience to passengers who use the airport during the three months period from January 6 to April 5 during which the runway will remain closed from 8.30 a.m. to 4.30 p.m,? Minister De Silva said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Sidibe: A lion behind lens
	
Malick Sidibe, the Malian photographer who died this year aged 80, made a name for himself with exuberant black and white images celebrating the country?s youth culture in the post-independence era.
He was nicknamed ?the eye of Bamako? after the city in Mali where he lived and worked.?
Blind in one eye, he opened ?Studio Malick? in 1958 and was little known outside his native country until Western curators and art dealers ?discovered? his work in the early 1990s.?
Exhibited widely throughout Europe and America since, in 2007 he became the first photographer and the first African artist to be awarded a Golden Lion award for lifetime achievement at the Venice Biennale.
He excelled in photographing the exuberant youth culture of Mali following its independence from France in 1960.?
His black and white photographs are unique and instantly recognisable. His grinning, dancing and playful subjects are in stark contrast to what one had seen hitherto in 19th and 20 century photographs of Asia and Africa, usually taken by Western photographers, where the subjects stare at the camera in solemn or even grim poses and moods. You rarely see a solemn face in Malick Sidibe?s work. The photographer is always seen with a big smile in his self-portraits, full of a zest for life, and this enthusiasm must have been contagious.?
Sidibe and his subjects seem to have not only bonded but blended into one when each picture was made. The viewer too, is drawn into an airy, mid-summer night?s dream mood, even though he or she may be totally unfamiliar with Malian culture and the socio-cultural context of Sidebe?s photographs.Speaking of the atmosphere at Studio Malick, the modest enterprise he ran in Bamako since 1958, Sidibe said: ?It was like a place of make-believe. People would pretend to be riding motorbikes, racing against each other. It was not like that at the other studios.?
?
"It was like a place of make-believe. People would pretend to be riding motorbikes, racing against each other. It was not like that at the other studios."
?
That certainly can?t be an exaggeration. His portraits are not like anyone else?s portraits. His subjects don?t seem to be conscious that they are facing a photographer. Rather, the photos seem to be taken by one of the group, a friend. Sidibe must have had a remarkable ability to win the trust of people younger than he was, not an easy thing to do. The secret of his success is trust. He trusts them and they trust him in return.?
Blind in one eye from a childhood accident, Sidibe was born to a humble village family in what was then called the French Sudan, perhaps in 1935. He would have been a goatherd but for the fact that he obtained a scholarship given by an urban ?white school, ?courtesy of his village chief. ?There, he was selected for the School of Sudanese Craftsmen in Bamako because of his drawing skills, where he was chosen by French photographer Gerard Guillat to work in his studio. Sidibe became Guillat?s studio assistant and purchased his first camera. Speaking of Guillat, Sidibe said later:?
?He didn?t teach me how to take photographs. But I watched him and I understood how to do it. I did the African events, the photos of Africans, and he did the European events ? the major balls, official events.?
In 1958, Sidebe opened his own studio in one of the few areas of Bamako to have electricity. Within a few years, Sidibe had established himself as the country?s only travelling documentary photographer, travelling by bicycle to dances, beach parties, night clubs and graduation ceremonies to photograph stylish young men and women.?
Young Malians in the cities were happy to embrace rock?n?roll. Sidebe undoubtedly came along at the right time because this electric combination ? a sense of freedom following independence, and a vibrant secular and cosmopolitan culture ? is now a thing of the past. As Sidebe noted: ?Music was the real revolution. Music freed us. Suddenly, young men could get closer to young women, hold them in their hands. Before, it was not allowed. And everyone wanted to be photographed dancing up close.?
In the 1970s, Sidibe returned to studio photography but by then he had created a lasting and unforgettable legacy in exuberant and unique images. His studio was tiny, just three metres by four, but his legacy is huge.

They changed the Adam and Eve story
	
Lesley Hazleton?is arguably the best living combination of a historian, theologist and novelist. Bringing to life characters and settings which have through the centuries been lost due to ?edited out? narratives and misplaced piety, Hazleton has through her books, re- created lives and times for what they actually were.?
Trained as a psychologist, Hazleton lived and worked in the Middle East, during which time she wrote for the New York Times, Harpers, New York review of books among many others.?
Her seminal work includes the biographies of the Mother Mary and Muhammad. Her book ?After the Prophet? which details the tragic story of the Sunni- Shia split, is considered the most lively and historically accurate portrayal of the Islamic world commencing from the death bed of Prophet Muhammad. Hailed by academic and literary circles alike, Hazleton?s work is best known for its historical accuracy and for its compelling grasp of the environment in which the characters emerge- resulting in compelling and riveting narrative story telling.?
Her books include ?Agnostic: a Spirited Manifesto?, ?Mary: A Flesh and Blood biography?, ? The First Muslim: The story of Muhammad? and ? Jerusalem; A memoir of War and Peace, Passion and Politics?.
She spoke to the ?s Hafeel Farisz from her houseboat in Seattle recently.
Q ?Since I fear that many of our readers may not be familiar with you, despite your ground-breaking work- It would be great if you could give us a basic introduction about yourself?
(laughs) It?s one of those lives that doesn?t fit into any narrative. I was born in England and got out as soon as I could. I then Lived in Jerusalem for 13 years, after which I moved to New York City and lived for 13 years. Then came to Seattle for what I thought would be 13 years but I?ve actually doubled that. Here I am after all that living on a shack on a raft, also known as a Houseboat- bordering on the edge of the continent, half way around the world- where I write about a lot which is the Middle East.?
And you know what? It is kind of perfect. It gives me perspective, because when you are in the middle of things it is very hard to get perspective. But when you are half the world away and yet know the place intimately- when I say intimately- it is not only the politics and not only the people- but the feel of the place, the sense of the place.?
I guess you can say that I?ve been living a kind of ?double life?- by which I don?t mean that one life is secret and the other not. I mean two lives at once. That?s how it felt when I was writing that whole series of biographies about figures from Mary to Muhammad. Figures from half the world and half the history away. But when I write, I come down and sit at my desk here at my house here on the lake, looking out at water and the mistiness that is Seattle and I sort of instantly transport into the deserts of the Middle East. It is being in two places at once.
Q ? But what prompted this need to understand religions? What prompted your fascination with Abrahamic religions?
The easy answer and I stress- the easy answer- is my own childhood. I was the only Jew in a convent school in England. On the one hand there was the Catholicism at school and on the other, there was the fairly orthodox Judaism at home. The interesting thing is that it didn?t do what you would have thought it would do. Which would?ve been for me to walk away and say ?a pox on all your houses?- I have nothing to do with religion in the future.?
But that is not what happened. What happened was, it set up, this sort of fascination with the hold that religion has. This goes very deep and is very emotional. I know people tend to think that religion is a matter of belief- that you have to ?believe? something. But the whole point of the idea of believing something, is that belief holds within itself the possibility of disbelief. Because you only have to believe something if you don?t know it for sure. If you know it- you know it. We know that the earth is round- you don?t ?believe? the earth is round, unless you are stuck in the 10th century or something. We know its round so you don?t need to ?believe? it.?
Belief is really trying to convince yourself that what you hope for- or what you think, or what you place your trust in, is actually so. And that is called faith. It?s not belief, it is called faith. And faith I think is wonderful. It is this leap beyond reason, . It is an act of courage. You know this is not rational but you place your faith. If I lend you a 100 bucks I do it in the good ?faith? that you will pay me back. I have no guarantee that you will pay me back. It is an act of trust in you right? And I think this is wonderful and that this is what makes us human. But if I absolutely ?believe?, if I try and convince myself 100% that you will pay me back- that is kind of nutty isn?t it?. Does that make sense?.
Q ?Yes it does. I was reading your last book ? Agnostic ? A spirited Manifesto?, and my biggest take away from it was this thing you spoke of ? about belief and faith- and this convoluted sense of certainty that many seem to possess. The certainty with which religion, any religion, is adhered. Be it in the East or the Middle East or the West. How do you think this comes about?
Let?s get one thing clear. The institution of Religion is man-made. And I emphasize ?Man? made, because women had a very little hand in it. ?. But, if you are religious it is a reflection of who you are. You can read the Bible or the Quran or any other sacred text and you can find in them reflections of who you are. If you are filled with hatred or violence then you will focus on those passages which you interpret as advocating hate and violence. If what you want is a life of love and peace, then you will focus on those passages.?
And you know both are available in all these texts. I mean these texts are not a matter of logic, they are not a matter of reason- that is why they have such a deep hold on us. Because they are mysterious and contradictory, and full of paradox. Today we tend to think of religion in the same way fundamentalist tend to think of religion. As this very set system of rules and laws that you have to obey and abide by, and if not you will be going to hell or whatever the equivalent of hell might be. But you know there are whole other ways of thinking about religion, where all these rules and laws are just institutional infrastructure.?
?
"Today we tend to think of religion in the same way fundamentalist tend to think of religion. As this very set system of rules and laws that you have to obey and abide by, and if not you will be going to hell or whatever the equivalent of hell might be"
?
?
They are just the beams but what is actually inside (religion) is what you bring to it. And that is a much wider concept, a much more open concept. It has to do with values and identity. You know people think religion is a matter of belief, but I disagree with that. I think it is a matter of identity. Of how you see yourself in the world. We all have many facets to our identity. I am Jewish, and I am agnostic, I?m feminist, and I?m a writer, I?m a psychologist- I can go on and on like this. These are all different facets of my personality and all of these come together in this one person. If you take any one of these facets away, I would be somebody else. But if any one of these facets comes under attack, then that facet which is under attack comes to the fore. When you identify yourself by only one (facet), then you are really limiting yourself to something very small.?
The magic to me is in the variety of ways in which we identify ourselves. Imagine being Iraqi or Syrian, what does it mean now to be Iraqi or Syrian when those states hardly exist? So you fall back on older, wider forms of identity like religion. So if you look at the divisiveness between Shia and Sunni Muslims, you will see that when it comes to the fore, when it gets expressed most violently, is when the larger framework has broken down. When people can no longer identify themselves as Syrian or Iraqi- then they fall back to these much more older identities, these much more emotional ones. And this of course is manipulated. It is manipulated immensely by various interested parties, both political and religious. And one of the reasons religion is so easy to manipulate is because it is not a matter of rationality or reason. It is a very deep emotional matter of identity, of tradition and of loyalty to that tradition.?
Q ? To get to the interesting aspects of your work, especially in these biographies, the fact that you are viewing these narratives which are so ingrained in the human psyche, from the outside, trying to weave through the facts. How difficult was this process? How difficult was it to establish the sources in which you drew your facts from, sifting through the mud and dust that has settled in over the centuries??
I am a psychologist and am also a writer, so I have a sense of story. A sense of narrative. So, let?s take Mary, that?s 1st Century Middle East. My questions are deceptively simple. Who was she really? Not the sort of statue in blue silk robes or the other similar images we have of her. But who was she really? This 13 year old peasant girl in 1st century Galilee under Roman occupation. When you frame the question that way- who must she have been? Obviously I can?t know for sure, but I can recreate who she was not only on the basis of what we have in the Gospels, which is very little, but also on the basis of Middle Eastern history, of Anthropology, of knowing the terrains, psychology and the use of empathy in placing yourself in the shoes of somebody else and of mythology also. I try to bring all these things together instead of taking only one source.?
I would use the term multi disciplinarily but that sounds terribly academic. What I really wanted to do was to bring her back to life. To give her flesh and blood,. To make her real. And I did the same thing basically with Muhammad, who is such a revered figure that sometimes it made me feel like he was being dehumanized. The Muslims idea of Muhammad is of such reverence, that he is called the perfect man. I don?t believe in perfection. Perfection is very boring. Muhammad had the most amazing life, a really dramatic life with amazing achievements. He is one of the most influential figures in all of history and I believe changed his world and is changing our world today.
Yet, each time I read a 19th or 20th or 21st century biography of him it was like taking a sleeping pill. I couldn?t fathom how one could make such a fascinating life so boring to read. Whether they were written as devotional biographies which are intensely boring or as academic biographies which tend to sort of tip-toe around, in the name of reverence, they didn?t bring across the real human being.
Q ? But to ask you again, how difficult was it to understand Mary the woman, as opposed to Mary ? the Mother of God, or Muhammad as a human being who lived in the Hejaazi desert, as opposed to everything else that comes with him?
It is far easier to relate to a human being, surely. (laughs). Perfection just doesn?t do it for me. You see a perfect face and there is nothing there, there is nothing to relate to. But you read or think about a man born into enormous problems and disadvantages and battling his way into greatness ?How did he do this? What was he thinking along the way??
What actually happened on the night of the first revelation? Of course there is no way to know exactly, but you could try. We do have his own words from that time. Again I tried to recreate the man, recreate his reality, to recreate the world he lived in, and the world he thought in. To make him real. I wrote the book the ?First Muslim? for Non -Muslims, because I was very aware of this enormous ? Chutzpah? (audacity/ impudence) of an agnostic Jew writing a biography of the Prophet of Islam. ?But my curiosity to understand the man was stronger ?than any kind of daunting aspect of it. So far as I knew, Muslims would not pay any attention to this. But it was enormously surprising, flattering and in a sense wonderful that so many Muslims have contacted me from all over the world and told me ?thank you for making him real?.
Q ?But why was that apprehension- that you may come into some sort of backlash from the Muslims?
Because I approached him as ?A Man? and not as ?The Prophet of God?. ?As a man who became a Prophet. I have been asked many a time, - how could you write so well about Mary or Muhammad and not be a believer in either of the religions??
The Agnostics stance is one of inquiry. You are not looking for ?The? answer. Because if you are agnostic there is no such thing- there are many forms of truth and many answers, all which give rise to perfect questions. There are no ultimate truths or ultimate answers. Many any of us try, especially fundamentalists, ?to pin everything down- ?This is the answer, this is the truth, this is the meaning of life? etc., and secular people do it too. We talk of ?The Universe? as if it?s some sort of thing, with limits and so on. Now we know there are billions of Universes, and there are many more we don?t know of, and many more we will never know of. We talk about ?The Soul? as if it?s a definable thing- as some part of us which we could define and say ?that is the soul?. ?But it?s ?a quality of being, a quality within us that we express.?
Q ? In the two biographies you tackle some crucial issues, like the ?Virginity? of Mary, something we find in all Abrahamic religions- where we have some sort of divinity used to support a claim. This is true with even Muhammad- where the attempt of suicide by him on the night of revelation is left out of the narrative just like the real story of the Satanic Verses, despite his early biographers like Ibn Thabari and Ibn Ishq detailing them. Even progressive Muslims wouldn?t entertain ?these thoughts. Where do you think this sense of divinity comes from and take us through the process of unravelling them?
We?ll leave divinity aside for a moment. We are talking of human experience. The Virgin birth story, is not specific to Christianity itself. It extends to many other mythologies including Greek and Roman ones.?
Part of it really is due to the modern concept of how we view virginity today. We have reduced ?virginity? to the idea of one tiny little human membrane- the hymen. We forget what ?Virginity? was and meant at the time. It was the symbol of fertility, as in ?virgin forest?. There is no forest more full of life than the ?virgin forest?.?
And this was the original meaning of ?virginity?, it was fertility. And this we forget and this is what is so wonderful about the concept of Mary- the Virgin Mother, it is a fertility concept. You are going to ask me- alright was she really physically a virgin? To which all I can say is- get a sense of wonder people, get a sense of mystery because that is what religion is about. It is not about rules, or laws- it is about everything we can?t understand. ?So anyone who says that she was physiologically not virgin, has no sense of mystery, no sense of poetry. They are just reducing everything to the smallest possible denominator. Anybody who says that she absolutely was a virgin- has no sense of reason, it?s not rational. ?This is what I find most dismaying about fundamentalism, because it reduces these huge, wonderful issues of mystery and awe and everything we cannot understand- to something very small. It?s ?the way I talk about conviction. Fundamentalists speak with absolute conviction that they are right, but what we forget about conviction is that it?s not only being ?convinced? that you are right about something- to be ?convicted? is also to be imprisoned. Conviction belongs to a ?very small mind. Religion is filled with paradoxes and that is what is so wonderful about them. Sitting with the paradox, exploring the paradox, understanding the paradox is to me the wonder of it. That is the poetry of it. And Religion without poetry is fundamentalism.
Q ? On that same note, even in your latest book- you use Muhammad?s experience at Mount Hira as an example of the humaneness of it all, ?just like you use the Satanic Verses ? as an example which makes the experience of Muhammad human- ?as opposed to this fantasized divinity. Both of which have been expunged ?from discourse even among the more liberal and secular Muslim circles. ?If you could run us through why you think these two examples do the exact opposite of what the more fundamentalist elements believed when expunging them?
What brought Muhammad alive to me was going back to the earliest sources. Going back to the earliest Islamic historians and meeting them. And they were writing 100 or 200 years after he died. ?That is the closest we can get, besides the Quran itself. And there are accounts there of the night of the revelation of the Quran on Mount Hira. ?
So, I mean, what you would expect from the standards we have now (from Muhammad) is ? Hallelujah; Him coming down from Mount Hira- bearing the truth and him floating on clouds and the sort. But that was not what happened. What happened was more human. He was terrified. What he saw, he experienced, was a revelation from God through Gabriel. Now you are going to ask me, ?Did God actually speak to Muhammad? or ? Did Muhammad imagine that God was speaking to him?? And I say it doesn?t matter.?
You respect his experience. This was what he experienced and it terrified him. It terrified him to the extent that his first reaction to think ?oh no I must be mad, I must be out of my mind. This cannot be happening- not to me, an ordinary person like me. I cannot go back and be raving like a lunatic and so I?m going to throw myself off this mountain and put an end to it all?. Then the Angel came back and stopped him. Now this to me is a human reaction. I could see Muhammad as a human being. Yes this is the way it had to have been. It has a ring of truth to it. And this is what I mean about being a writer and being a psychologist. You go through all these accounts and some of them are written over in later dates, and written in piety and reverence and so on- it doesn?t work on a human level. But in some of them, you get an early sense, a very immediate sense of what happened and you think ? oh yes this I recognize, this is human, this is what must?ve happened?. And it is very exciting, after all this time, to be able to read through 14 centuries and find this humanness. I think that is terribly exciting.
?
	I wanted to recreate Muhammad and Mary for the human beings they were
	
	
	There are no ultimate ?Truths? or ?answers?
	
	
	?Belief? is the ultimate paradox
	
Q ?In two other books ?Jezebel- the untold story of the Bibles harlot Queen?? and the book ? After the Prophet? you deconstruct the politics that came with religion. As some sort of a pointer to the creation of the institution of religion and narratives that today are believed to be carved in stone. If you could talk us through this?
Well, Jezebel for an instance is a fascinating historical morality tale. It?s not about human morality, but a morality tale of ?who gets to write history?. If there was a morale to the story of Jezebel, it is never let your enemies write your story (laughs). Her story was written in the Bible in the two books of Kings two centuries after she died. And she became sort of the bad girl of the Bible. By the way it was fascinating writing about her, after writing about Mary- because in both instances, these were two women who had been dehumanized. On the one hand Mary- by being revered and sanctified and on the other hand Jezebel- by being reviled and demonized. And in the process both of them, the real person had disappeared completely. And it was the real person I wanted to get back to. Again I kept asking the very deceptively simple question ? who was she, who must she have been??. ?
It was amazing to go back and realize that Jezebel was a Princess of the most advanced civilization of the time, it was 9th century BC- in this city state of the East Coast of the Mediterranean, what is now Lebanon. They were the most advanced in civilization- the first to create the alphabet and the Phoenician alphabet, which later became the basis for the Hebrew alphabet with which the Bible was written. She was ?married off? she comes to Israel, ?and there was this sort of cultural imperialism. It was like when a dominant power takes over economically and politically.?
The story is very dramatic itself and she is completely demonized. But this demonization has to do is with the politics of the time in which her story was written- 200 years later. It is a magnificent story, about Prophet Elijah. ?The? major Prophet of all the Hebrew Prophets and she faces him down. And what does he do? He runs from her, in terror. He runs all the way down to Sinai and complains to God and says ?help me this woman is awful, what can I do?? and so on, and God says ? that?s it? to Elijah and sacks him. And then Prophet hood is given to Elisha. Elisha is completely ruthless. It?s a great standoff between this very proud Phoenician Princess and this very Old Style Biblical Prophet and she wins.?
This is what a lot forget- that she wins. She loses in the long run of course, because of retribution and all that. But after her and her husband the Kingdom and Israel go ?to pieces. Resulting in the ?Exile?. It was in Babylon that the story was written by those who blamed her (for the exile). ?Because of course you always blame the woman (laughs) something which goes back to Adam and Eve.
Q ? In ?After the Prophet? you do the same with Aisha. There has been a lot of dust which has settled in, and you probe through all of this and bring to life a buoyant, vivacious and intelligent woman?
That is what is so amazing when you go back to the earliest sources. Because you go back prior to the takeover of the religions by the bearded old men, [when] the women are still there where the women play very vital roles. So you have Aisha , after Muhammad dies, his youngest widow- leading an army of ten thousand men ?against his Son In Law and cousin Ali. Whether you agree with Aisha or not, it is really not relevant. I mean look at her. She is right there in the middle of the battle, sitting on top of a Camel- after which the Battle is named, hurling these blood curdling war cries. And you think wow this is not the image of Muslim women that I had. She was very forthright, very outspoken and central to the whole story of the Shia- Sunni split. Central to what happens in the 50 years after Muhammad?s death. And it is fascinating to rediscover history this way, to delve underneath all these accretions and accumulations of the centuries. To get beyond all these ?editing outs? and ?deletions? over the centuries and get back to what it really was. That is when you get these wonderful stories.?
That whole story of the Shia- Sunni split is amazing. Islam- as Muhammad founded it, was the religion of unity. ? One God, one people? was the Principle. And the one thing he and everybody around him was most eager to avoid was ? fitnah?. And yet you follow that whole story of what happened in those 50 years- where everybody is terrified of fitnah, yet despite It being the one thing you most want to avoid -with every step they take it is the one thing they bring closer. Now if this not a human story, if this no Greek tragedy, then what is?.
Q ? To move on to some general questions, you pay a lot of attention to Ibn Ishq and Ibn Thabari in deciphering the stories- from the earliest of those the sources. I am using the two of them as examples because of my background. One thing is that many Muslims, have not even heard of them, let alone read them.
I?ll let you in on a secret. Neither have many Western Scholars( laughs). They don?t go back to the sources. Because if you do go back and read them- it is amazing. The detail in theirs- all the juice of real life is there. Everything that is missing from these modern biographies, are all there. We tend think ? old history is boring?. It is totally the other way with Islamic history. The further back you go, the earlier you go- the more exciting it becomes. They are more redolent of real life. These are oral histories. Ibn Ishq and Al Thabari were just travelling around getting people?s memories. They would have twenty different versions of the same event- twenty different people telling them about this one scene from a battle, and each one (of the people telling them) had got their own style of storytelling. And if you have a sense of the history, language, culture and terrain you could tell which ones are true, and which ones are edited. They are so lively. There is one where this young boy was coming out of the tent to fight and somebody recalls ? The buckle of his sandal was undone, the left one I think?. And you can just hear it right?. Another one says ? I saw the sun glinting off the loop earring of his ear?. These kinds of details are so real. You feel like you are there. I have a lot of respect for these two men, they are the most extraordinary historians I know of. ?
Q ? Earlier you spoke of the story of Adam and Eve relating it to how the woman was blamed or left out. It is a phenomenon that you see in all Abrahamic religions and even in Eastern religions. How does this happen?
There is Adam and there is Eve and there is the Apple of the tree of knowledge- knowledge!!! Eve reaches to the Apple of the tree of Knowledge. I mean say that to anybody now ? they will say ?wow that?s great, what the hell is wrong with Adam? Doesn?t he want knowledge??.But that doesn?t happen, they turn the story completely around. She becomes the bad one for reaching for knowledge and he becomes the good one for not reaching it ( laughs).
Q ?But why do you think that happened? Even in Eastern religions the protagonist is always a man. If you take Buddhism for example, a woman is told that she can?t attain Nirvana and that she has to aspire to be reincarnated a man if she is to attain Nirvana. The Prophets of all Abrahamic religions are also men. Why did this happen?
Oh that?s a long story. We could see it in early Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The way the power structures developed, after- after, the central figures were dead. And the women got pushed aside. In early Christianity by the way, there were women Bishops. It was politics and women obviously lost out. But on the other hand if you go to Greek and Roman religions or even Samarrian religions or Egyptian mythology, women played a hugely important role which changed over time. Now why is an excellent question and there are a few more books to be written about that.
Q ?In your understanding, what role did religion play in the socio economics and politics of those times, and is that role which was played in the socio economic and political sense, valid today? Do we need to continue with it?
Well, it depends on what ?time?. During the time of Mary or the time of Muhammad, religion was not separate from politics, from identity from tribe and so on. It was integrated. In fact there was no concept of religion as something separate. It was all part of you who were. It didn?t require belief, just simply acceptance. There was far less tied around with laws and rituals. It was tradition. It was never a matter of belief. So when Muhammad ,for instance, was travelling around the Arabian peninsula and tribe after tribe was pledging allegiance to him, there was no insistence that they became religious Muslims. He didn?t insist on it at all. All they had to do was pledge allegiance to him and his conception of God. And this they did. Because his conception of God ? Allah?, ?which is exactly the same word and meaning of ? El? in Phoenician or ? Elohim? in Hebrew- Al- Lah ,the high one, already existed. It wasn?t a new concept. One of the brilliant things about Muhammad is that he adopted frameworks which already existed in Arabia ?brought them together in a new way. ?Allah was already the high God in the Arabian Peninsula and there were many subordinate gods, tribal totems. And the question was about the relationship between the tribal totems with the high God, and his insistence was that there was only one God. What has happened now though, is that we have made religion an institution of itself. And people imagine all religions are and should be the same thing. There are different ways of being a Buddhist, a Christian and a Jew. When fundamentalist say ? there is only one way to practise?, they are lying. They are trying to insist by being so loud and violent, they are trying to impose their extremist version. And it is the duty of all of us- those who are religious and those who aren?t to resist them with all our might.
Q ?Finally as a person who has studied theology and then gone beyond to understand the gamut of the environment which gave birth to these religions- do you think that religion is relevant today? Is it not time to go beyond them?
That is like asking if poetry is relevant? Is it relevant in the same way as food and shelter? No. But is that ( food and shelter) all there is to life? No. It is relevant when it comes to answering the unanswerable, great big existential questions. ? What am I doing in this world??, ? what is the meaning of all this?? and so on. Of course they aren?t rational questions, but if we limit ourselves to purism, we are going to become very small indeed. I know Atheists like Hitchens ( Christopher) and all that describe religion as the source of all the evil in the world. ?His concept of religion was fundamentalism. That?s a straw God, it is very easy to attack fundamentalism. Religion is the way in which the wonder, the mystery and the sense awe of being in this world is expressed. I think it?s wonderful. This is not in the sense of religious institutions, but in the sense of what you would call spirituality- that makes us larger as human beings.
"?I am a psychologist and I am also a writer, so I have a sense of story. A sense of narrative. So, let?s take Mary, that?s 1st Century Middle East. My questions are deceptively simple. Who was she really? Not the sort of statue in blue silk robes or the other similar images we have of her. But who was she really?"

Thugs were brought to make protest violent:  Gammanpila
	
The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila, who took part in the protest which turned violent at Hambantota on Saturday, charged that government MPs had brought thugs from elsewhere to the location of their protest to make it violent.
The MP said United National Party (UNP) MPs Chandima Gamage and Nalin Bandara Jayamaha were behind this.
?These MPs brought thugs to Hambantota. Residents regardless of their political differences, united to chase the outsiders away. That is what happened,? MP Gammanpila told a news conference.
He said their protest was peaceful and the water attack was launched while Ven. Omare Kassapa Thera was chanting Karaniya Metta Sutta. ?The Government wanted to prevent the monks from issuing a Sangha Order,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

TNA positive about subcommittee reports on new Constitution
	
The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) said yesterday it was ?fairly positive? in the overall context about the reports submitted by the six subcommittees with proposals for making the new Constitution.
The TNA, which is the main Opposition of Parliament, had its Parliamentary group meeting yesterday.
Party?s Jaffna district MP M.A. Sumanthiran told the Daily Mirror that his party would await the interim report by the Steering Committee so that all the matters could be discussed.
?We discussed the contents of the subcommittee reports and also other fixed ideas about the Steering Committee. Generally, there was enthusiasm regarding the work that has been done so far. There were various concerns raised. In the overall context, what has been produced for discussion is fairly positive.?
The party expressed hope that the Constitution making process would be taken forward without any delay for the resolution of what he called the ?national question?.
?We recognize that this is the wonderful opportunity to bring that to an end. We hoped that this process will be taken forward without any further delay. Generally, there is enthusiasm about work that has been done so far,? he said.
Asked about his opinion on the report by the committee on centre-periphery relations, he said:
?That is nothing more than what the All Party Representative Committee (APRC) recommended and what former President Mahinda Rajapaksa termed ?the 13th Plus. This only talks about a government which is more efficient and closer to people at three levels- the centre, the provincial councils and the local authorities.?
Asked whether the TNA was satisfied with its recommendations, he said it was a good document as a base for discussion. (Kelum Bandara)

'Tree man' cured
	
A Bangladeshi man dubbed the 'tree man' because of the bark-like warts on his body has undergone treatment that doctors hope may have cured him of his condition.
Abul Bajandar has had at least 16 operations to remove 11 lbs of growths from his hands and feet since his condition came to doctors' attention a year ago.
The 27-year-old former rickshaw driver is one of only four people in the world ever to be diagnosed with epidermodysplasia verruciformis, an extremely rare genetic condition dubbed 'tree-man disease' that left him unable to hold his three-year-old daughter. (Daily Mail)

Trumps lambasts ?fools? who oppose better Russia ties
	
?
President-elect Donald Trump condemned Russia critics on Saturday, calling those who oppose better relations with Moscow ?stupid? people and ?fools? in his latest Twitter tirade. ??
His attack comes a day after the Republican president-elect met the country?s leading intelligence agency chiefs -- including the director of national intelligence, James Clapper, and CIA chief John Brennan -- who told him that Russian President Vladimir Putin directed a vast cyberattack and leaking campaign aimed at helping install Trump in the White House. ??
??Having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing,? he tweeted on Saturday. ?Only ?stupid? people, or fools, would think that it is bad!? ?When I am President,? he added, ?Russia will respect us far more than they do now and both countries will, perhaps, work together to solve some of the many great and pressing problems and issues of the WORLD!? ??
But the formal announcement of former Indiana Senator Dan Coats as Trump?s pick for US director of national intelligence, also on Saturday, may go at least a little toward reassuring those critical of Trump?s praise for Putin and desire to improve relations with Moscow. ? ?A mild-mannered former ambassador to Germany who also served on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Coats, 73, has been a vocal critic of Russia?s annexation of Crimea.?
