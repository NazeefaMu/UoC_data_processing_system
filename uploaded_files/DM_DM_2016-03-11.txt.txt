Bank of Ceylon deposit base exceeds Rs. 1 trillion
	
The Bank of Ceylon, the Sri Lankan banking giant has scored its second trillion by its deposit base reaching over Rs. 1 trillion.
With this achievement Bank has created history by being the first and the only bank in Sri Lanka to passthis milestone.
The Banks historic first trillion was achieved in year 2012 by earning a Rs. 1 trillion asset base which was the first time any corporate entity had achieved a Rs. 1 trillion balance sheet in Sri Lanka.
Along with this achievement the bank made another headline by earning the highest ever profit made by a single Sri Lankan business entity which is Rs. 25.3 billion PBT, bettering its own record set by its 2014 profit before tax of Rs.20.3 billion.
Our strategic objectives have always been in line with the Governments economic development initiatives. The country is in a progressive path for a refined and long term economic and social development. In this ambitious journey the Bank is connected with each one of the economic and social areas directly or indirectly and we are bound to ensure that we maintain our performance at the highest level to fulfill our duty towards the country stated the Banks Chairman Ronald C.Perera.
The Bank of Ceylon did not achieve this target single handedly. Therefore we are thankful for the support and trust it received from its main stakeholder the Government of Sri Lanka and its loyal customers ranging from individuals to corporate entities from all walks of life. Most importantly the dedication and the hard work that was rendered by the staff of the Bank was yet another key pillar in achieving this target stated the General Manager D.M. Gunsekera. Whilst thanking all our stakeholders who have joined hands with us in this journey, I wish to announce that we are now planning towards our third trillion in near future. he further added.
The Bank has been recognized by a number of reputed international and local institutions. The most recent was winning the Over-all Gold award and becoming the winner at the National Business Excellence Awards 2015 organized by the National Chamber of Commerce, in the categories of Banking sector, Excellence in CSR, Excellence in Local Market reach and Extra-large category and the runner-up of Excellence in Capacity building. BOC was also named as the Strongest Bank in the country by The Asian Banker, making it stand with other banking giants in Asia Pacific region. The Bank has been ranked among the Top 1000 Banks in the world with the country rank No.1 by the prestigious U.K based magazine The Banker. These fortify not only the image of the bank but also that of the countrys economic profile by uplifting the Sri Lankan Banking industry in the international arena.

Cross-talk in Parliament over LG elction
	
The Government said yesterday there was no legal provision to hold the local government election till the issues pertaining to the de-limitation of wards were resolved.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who responded to a question asked by MP Dinesh Gunawardena in Parliament, said the deadline to submit petitions to the committee looking into shortcomings had been further extended, as more complaints were coming in continuously even after the earlier deadline had lapsed. He said the elections would be declared as soon as the shortcomings were rectified. Even Lorenzo de Almeida would have done the de-limitation better," Mr. Wickremesinghe said.
Mr. Gunewardena who responded said the deadline given to submit complaints to the committee appointed to look into the shortcomings was to have ended in November 30, 2015 and then extended up to February 2016 but now it had been further extended for the third time. This he said was a tactical move to postpone the elections and highlighted the fact that the work of the local government bodies was now at a standstill.
Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake said the local government election was postponed because of political disadvantages faced by the two main allies of the government. He said one of the main reasons was the divisions within the SLFP led UPFA. Mr. Dissanayake however accepted the fact that even the Commissioner had called for the amendments to the local government elections bill. He said these could be discussed in Parliament but until then elections could be held under the existing PR system.
Local Government Minister Faizer Mustapha said there was no legal provision to hold the elections when thousands of petitions had been received with regard to de-limitation of the wards.
MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara who joined in the cross-talk said elections should be held for the local bodies with no de-limitation issues.
It was finally decided that parties should have a dialogue on this matter and decide on the election. (YP)

Lankan asylum-seeker cleared of indecent assault
	
A Sydney District Court jury has found Sri Lankan asylum-seeker Daxchan Selvarajah not guilty of indecently attacking a sleeping university student in her bed.
Mr Selvarajah, 24, was accused of ripping through a flyscreen door at the student's home at Macquarie University in the early hours of February 21, 2013, before molesting her in her bed.
He beamed and began wiping his eyes as he stepped from the dock on Friday morning, after the jury's foreman informed the court he and his fellow jurors had reached a not guilty verdict on all charges.
The most serious of the three charges Mr Selvarajah faced was breaking and entering and indecently assaulting the young woman, who alleged she woke to feel a hand under her pyjamas.
During a two-week trial, Mr Selvarajah had told the court he left home in the early hours to buy cigarettes from someone who he thought was a fellow Sri Lankan.
"I knew he was living in that building but I didn't know exactly which unit," he said.(9news)
"I had gotten addicted to smoking that many cigarettes, I could not stop.
"That's why I could not fall asleep."
As the jury was led from the courtroom on Friday, an elated Mr Selvarajah hugged supporters and shook hands with his lawyers.
He was not held on remand over the charges but has been kept in immigration detention since 2013 after authorities refused him an Australian visa due to the attack allegations.
It was not immediately clear whether he would walk free from court a free man or be returned to Villawood detention centre. (9news)

Sampath MY Bank targets unbanked and underbanked segments of society: COO
	
As one of Sri Lankas leading commercial banks, Sampath Bank has made an indelible mark within the countrys financial services industry and is now a trusted name among Sri Lankans.
Its current aspiration is to transform Sri Lankas banking landscape with the concept of a cashless society and in line with this, the Bank has introduced its latest product  Sampath MY Bank, in a move to seamlessly transition from traditional brick and mortar branches and offer its customers ultimate ease and convenience in banking.
Sampath Bank Chief Operating Officer Nanda Fernando explains what this product comprises of, how it will benefit Sri Lankans and how it will assist in promoting financial inclusion across the country:
Could you explain what Sampath MY Bankis and what it will offer
This product was launched by Sampath Bank very recently to provide financial services at affordable costs, in order to make banking truly accessible to any Sri Lankan, from people in cities to disadvantaged communities and the lower-income segments of society. Simply put, this product will enable an individual to open an account without even having to visit a bank. This will be made possible through an active network of trusted Merchants island-wide appointed by the Bank  an individual will be able to walk into any Merchant outlet and obtain all the services provided by the Sampath MY Bank accounts.
This will do away with the need for actually visiting a bank. While this may not seem like a hassle in the bigger cities, in more rural areas, visiting a Bank can be a time-consuming and expensive task for people. As a start, the Sampath MY Bank account will offer four services  opening of an account, cash deposits, cash withdrawal and balance inquiry.
What is required by a customer who wishes to open one of these accounts
A person simply needs to give his or her mobile number and NIC number to open an account. They need to visit one of our appointed Merchants, who will be equipped with a POS terminal provided by us. The Merchant will do the needful and open the account via the POS terminal. A few minutes after opening the account, the customer will be able to deposit cash into the account, and thereafter, use the card to withdraw cash or purchase goods and services from the appointed Merchants.
As the promotional period, the MY Bank card will be issued free of charge and the initial deposit will be a minimum of Rs. 50. The card issued will store the funds deposited and be a non-interest bearing account similar to a prepaid phone card. While we have currently launched this product with 12Merchants approved by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, we are looking to expand our Merchant network throughout the island.
Initially, there will be limitations on deposits and maximum balance in accounts. Deposits are limited to Rs. 5,000per account per day. Further, when the customer accumulates up to Rs. 100,000, the Bank will intervene to guide the customer to open a regular interest-bearing savings account, while continuing the Sampath MY Bank account as well.
What was Sampath Banks objective in launching such a product
Our objective is to ensure that every Sri Lankan will have access to opening and managing a bank account, opening up avenues within the banking system for them. Currently, the percentage of account holders in the country is quite low, especially in outstation areas. Our target audience with this product are the unbanked and underbanked segments of society. We want to encourage people even in villages to get into the habit of saving in order to be able to service a loan facility and to enable parents to open accounts for their children.
The biggest advantage with Sampath MY Bank accounts is that through the Merchant network, people will be able to carry out transactions even after the usual banking hours, as these Merchants being super stores or small shops, have extended operating hours much more than traditional Banking hours and are open 365 days a year. It will also empower the Merchants themselves, by way of increasing the number of walk-in customers.
Although in this initial phase, the product is limited to just four services, the overall plan for the product consists of 20 features, which will be rolled out in stages.
Why is financial inclusion vital for our economy
It is important for two reasons. Firstly, from the viewpoint of the Lankan population, it is necessary that they have access to creating an account as financial saving is essential for personal stability and growth. Secondly, savings are a huge benefit to the economy, especially in a country such as ours  currently, the accumulation of savings is not sufficient. To increase these numbers, people need to have a bank account and a product like this is the ideal mechanism to encourage them to do so. Customers will be able to deposit their daily profits, avoid unnecessary expenditure, record monthly turnover and really start saving.

SF in favour of intl probe
	
Minister Sarath Fonseka, the war time commander of the Sri Lanka Army, said today in Parliament that an international probe should be conducted as stipulated in the Geneva resolution.
Mr. Fonseka, in his first parliamentary address after nomination as an MP, said he endorsed it as the commander who the led the military at that time.
We should not shy away from any investigation. We should not resent foreign participation, he said.
He also said that the political interference during the last stages of the war had caused the country to face the white flag issue.
Field Marshal Fonseka said the LTTE had been cornered to a small lagoon area during the last month o f the war, and therefore even low ranking military personnel such as corporals could have finished it off without the involvement of the top brass of the military.
He said the political leadership asked him to take respite from the operational duties, and instead assigned the political authority to handle the military operations. He noted that this should be probed to absolve the military of any charge.
The white flag charges could have been avoided if the political leadership who tried to grab credit for the war victory handled the military operations effectively." he said.
He said he would reveal the truth on the final stages of the war through a book which he hoped to publish soon. An investigation has to be done on the white flag issue so that people could know the truth" he said.
He said he had to visit China urgently during the final stages of the war as he had finalized some purchase orders which the army had made. Besides he said the services of high ranking officers including the Army commander was not necessary as the LTTE was trapped at that time. Low ranking officers could have handed the war easily if they were given a free hand, he said.
Delivering a verbal attack on the Rajapaksa family he alleged a sum of US 2 million dollars was given to the LTTE during the 2005 presidential election campaign to get the LTTE to prevent the people in the North and the East from voting. He alleged that former Minister Basil Rajapaksa himself had revealed this to him.
He said counting was stopped in centers in Kandy, Ratnapura, Gampaha, Anuradhapura and Matale districts during the 2015 presidential election.
Referring to the arrest of Ven. Uduwe Dammaloka Thera, the field Marshal said Buddhist monks get caught and are sent to prison when those who steal elephant calves come and dump them in temples. If the Venerable Dhammaloka Thera is imprisoned why is it that former Defense Secretary is allowed to get away," he questioned alleging that former Defense Secretary was also involved in the thefts of elephants.
Accusing the former president and his family of various charges the Field Marshal said they would have to pay for their crimes. "We cannot think twice when it comes to penalizing the Rajapaksas" he said. Singing the famous song Duka Sepa Nithi Perale, he said the Rajapaksas never thought the wheel would turn.

A wise man once said that the greatest legacy one can pass onto ones children and grandchildren is neither money nor materialistic things accumulated in ones life, but a legacy of character and faith.
K.Sivagananathan, an innovative banker, is one such who lived up to those words.
He is defined as a mighty oak, a devoted and caring husband who fulfilled his responsibilities to the fullest, a dutiful father, a guru who moulded leaders for tomorrow, an officer with great ability and a banker who created a different era.
His 14th year remembrance was commemorated recently by his family and colleagues at the Annual Memorial Oration and Memorial Trust Awards Ceremony which widely acknowledged his work, contributions and influence on the banking industry.
According to Association of Professional Bankers of Sri Lanka President Shashi Kandambi, he was a legend in Sri Lankas
banking industry.
He headed numerous prestigious committees, always looking to initiate to develop the banking industry in Sri Lanka, he also took a great interest in banking education and there are many students in the banking industry today because of him including my self, she fondly remembered.
One of the major contribution he has done to the industry was the strong link that had been established between the Sri Lanka institute of bankers and the institute bankers of London as he had played a major role in formalising this arrangement as he wanted to raise the professional standard of bankers on par with international standards.
For his part, State Enterprise Development Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne, who delivered the Memorial Oration, said that he remembers K.Sivagananathan as a senior at the time he joined the industry as a management trainee in 1984.
From Mr.Siva to Central Bank former governor A. S. Jayawardena, they did not treat us like brats though we were much younger, they treated us like colleagues. Often engaging us in debates in financial issues, he said reminiscing the past.
Today I stand here as a deputy minister among other responsibilities thanks to Mr. Silva and other seniors, he said.
He always comes to work by 7 in the morning, dressed in white. He had a such a cracking pace of activity, never complaining and always with a smile on his face, Wickramaratne shared what other bankers had said about him.
K.Sivagananathan rose to many ranks in different institutions including the Senior Deputy General Manager of BoC, with a determination not only to succeed as a professional but also to transform the industry landscape and give back to the industry which continues to be a driving force behind the nations economy. After his retirement from BoC he continued to work within the industry as the CEO in Janashakthi Insurance Company PLC and there after as a consultant to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.
It was following his untimely demise and discovery of a letter written by him, requesting of formation of a trust, K.Sivagananathan Memorial Trust was established in 2002, to provide assistance to educate and support growing talent within the bank and finance sector in the country.
The trust was orientated as a humble request from him as he had asked from whatever the savings we have, to be able to give to that pack to the population of Sri Lanka in educating them in banking and finance, recalled his son Nathan Sivagananathan.
Apart from his innovative contribution to the bank he was involved in many new concepts as a solution to the banking industry such as pioneering in introducing automated tele machine, home banking, specialised travels and several other products
When it was his turn to speak, Bank of Ceylon CEO D. M. Gunasekara, who was the guest of honour, said that  K.Sivagananathan is a great person whom he respected
a lot.
He was a gentleman and a social worker, a dynamic worker, a disciplinarian who possessed a golden heart, always had a charming smile and a majestic personality, he always stood for justice and fair play, he said.
He was innovative and assertive, he had a pleasing personality who was popular among his colleagues, a man with less words, a man who helped without expecting anything in return, a man who wanted to help anyone who came to him, he went on
to say.
Emulating the audience on  K.Sivagananathans personal life, Gunasekara said that looking at his contribution done towards the industry one might think that he was fully committed to his career neglecting his family, But it was not the case, he helped his siblings in numerous ways after the demise of his father, he was a loving father and a husband as well, he said.
In the era of digitalisation we need more bankers like Siva, bankers who are capable of managing the future beyond challenges, Gunasekara stressed.
In his concluding remarks, he requested the young bankers to learn from late K.Sivaganathans life story, adapt what is relevant and apply it to their lives.

Tax revision proves govt. is in crisis: JVP
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) alleged yesterday that the governments proposed tax revision clearly indicated that the government faced a crisis and that the revision would adversely affect the lives of the ordinary people.
JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said that the government had been unable to present a budget without making so many amendments to it within three months.
He said the proposal to increase VAT to 15 % would definitely result in the increase in in cost of all goods and services in the country, and added that people would have to pay more for health care and education due to the removal of tax concessions granted to the private sector.
Mr. Dissanayake said the revision of the Nation Building Tax (NBT) would badly affect small scale businessmen as the ceiling had been lowered to a turnover of Rs. 3 million from Rs. 3.75 million.
He said Prime Minister Wickremesinghes assertion that the tax revision was introduced because the loans obtained by the previous government were not included in the budget presented by the government was a complete lie and that it was an attempt to justify this new tax revision.
Mr. Dissanayake said the government's request for IMF support to trace the loans taken by the previous government was a joke as they had given it all the details regarding undeclared loans taken by the previous government.
If the government wants to find about the loans, it can find it out easily through the ministers who were in charge of government institutions such as SriLankan Airlines, the CTB and the Urban Development Authority. No special teams from the IMF are needed for this purpose, he said.(Ajith Siriwardana)

Work on new Constitution to begin in May
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today said work on drafting the new constitution would begin in May after the report of the Public Representations Committee on Constitutional Reforms was handed over in April.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said the views and opinions of everyone would be considered when drafting the new constitution.
Mr. Wickremesinghe expressed these views when he met with the members of the Public Representations Committee on Constitutional Reforms at Temple Trees today.
He said they needed to move forward with drafting the constitution as the resolution to appoint a Constitutional Assembly to draft a new Constitution was passed in parliament on Tuesday (8).
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said that while a new constitution was not envisaged the government would base the new constitution using two guidelines including that of amending the electoral system.
When we brought in the 20th Amendment to the Constitution, everyone was not in agreement about the electoral system. We are holding discussions with the main political parties on the electoral system. But we will consider the recommendations of the Public Representations Committee before taking a decision on this, he said.
Mr. Wickremesinghe requested the committee to submit their report by April 31 so that the work on the new constitution could begin by May. He said what people expected was not a UNP, SLFP or JVP constitution but a new constitution to suit the 21st century.
The committee informed the Prime Minister that they would submit an additional report based on the ideas put forward by the general public to which Mr. Wickremesinghe responded that he would take them also into consideration when drafting the constitution and include some provisions in the constitution to look into those concerns as well.

Yala accidents on the decline
	
The Wildlife Department (WLD) said today the number of accidents within the Yala National Park had decreased during the past few months after the regulations to minimize road accidents and punishment to reckless drivers were strictly implemented.
New regulations were imposed after several incidents of wild animals including leopards being killed by speeding vehicles were reported in Yala National Park.
Wildlife Director General Chandrasiri Bandara said only one accident of a wild boar being hit by a vehicle was reported during the last three months.
After several accidents were reported, we deployed a mobile patrol during opening hours and increased police patrols so that all vehicles that enter the Yala Park will be monitored. We took maximum legal action against those who violate the Wildlife Conservation Act. Some drivers were imprisoned after being found guilty of knocking down animals within the Park, he said.
Mobile phone facilities for visitors within the Yala National Park were disconnected considering animal safety because some of the vehicle drivers are known to have knocked down animals, having driven their vehicles after receiving text messages of sighting rare animals.
Mr. Bandara said humps were also put up on the roads to slow down speeding vehicles, notice boards and banners were displayed to make the public aware on the importance of upholding the law.
However, he said even despite the decrease in the number of accidents, the regulations would continue. (Piyumi Fonseka)
