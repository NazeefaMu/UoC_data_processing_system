A State Minister receives three cheques from Mendis Co.: ASG
	
Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Yasantha Kodagoda today informed the Colombo Fort Magistrate that a state minister of the government had received three cheques worth Rs.3 million in 2015 and 2016 from W.M. Mendis & Company Ltd owned by Arjun Aloysius, an accused in the Central Bank bond scam.
ASG Kodagoda also informed court that according to investigations, this state minister had used this money for his election campaign. The name of the state minister, which was stated in the B report, was not revealed in open court by the prosecution.
According to a statement given to the CID by a police officer attached to the security detail of the state minister, he had chased one cheque, which had been received in 2015, at a reputed Bank in Slave Island.
The ASG informed court that the other two cheques were also cashed in a similar manner.
He also informed court that the CID would obtain a statement from the particular state minister and that UPFA MP Dayasiri Jayasekara would also make a statement to the CID regarding the cheque of Rs.1 million he is alleged to have received from Walt & Row Associates, a PTL-related Group Company in 2015.
At the inquiry, ASG Kodagoda told court that according to the search warrant, the CID had checked the PTL head office on May 30, June 1 and June 2 this year and taken some documents containing important facts, a laptop and external hard drives into their custody.(Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Yasantha Kodagoda today informed the Colombo Fort Magistrate that a state minister of the government had received three cheques worth Rs.3 million in 2015 and 2016 from W.M.

## Title: A tribute to my film Canon camera as Canon announces the end of its EOS film cameras Cannonising a C

A tribute to my film Canon camera as Canon announces the end of its EOS film cameras Cannonising a C
	
EOS reaches the end of the line, but dont make any predictions

A recent news story titled The end of an era: Canon kills off last film camera prompted me to write this. Is it the end of film and film cameras Dont make any predictions. The end of vinyl records and record players was predicted long ago, but theyare back.
Ive used different makes of camera in my life, from Asahi Pentax to Zenit SLRs and Fed rangefinders made in Russia. But my mainstay wasalways Canon.
It was quite by accident. I first took to photography when I was working as a subeditor and writing my first articles for the Jordan Times in Amman.
Feeling an urge to learn photography, I went to the only photographic course in town, at the Alliance Francaise. The young Jordanian photographer in charge, a Canon user, advised me to buy one. I was thinking of buying a Minolta but bought a Canon instead. It seemed a good decision once I returned home, as Minolta was almost unknown here, and had no agent and almost no second-hand market.
The photography class didnt last long, by the way. The director disliked the teacher, for some reason, and stopped the class after two sessions. I learned photography on my own.
Why many Nikon fans switchedto Canon
	All major camera makers offered a range, from high endto low.

Im not sentimental about the names stuck on cameras. Camera owners, like some vehicle owners, are fiercely loyal to brand names. At the time, the mass of press and other pro photographers bought Nikons. The Nikon was discovered and elevated to this mythical status by American press photographers during the Korean War. The top end models were rugged, but there were other equally rugged cameras in the market. But the American press corps loved the Nikon and the make achieved demi-god status in the US and elsewhere.
I wasnt a professional photographer by any means, just a writer in love with photography, and I saw a used Canon FTb in a camera repair shop for Rs. 5,000, and found it to be as rugged and reliable as any Nikon. Thereafter Canon became my main workhorse until my lab stopped processing film two years ago.
That FTb was lost when I was cornered by a mob in Pettah the day the Indo-Lanka accord was signed. My friend Douglas Curran, the dreamy American, who signed me up as a free-lancer for AFP in that fateful year, paid me Rs. 5,000 for a replacement FTb, which I still have.
The Canon EOS, the last film-loading camera mentioned in the news story, is a world apart from that FTb.
The EOS 650 launched in 1987 finally knocked Nikon off its demi-god status. Its almost indestructible (Unless you set fire to it or use a sledgehammer) and was much easier to use to than its top end Nikon rivals, and many Nikon fans switched to Canon. To avoid misunderstanding, let it be said that the EOS range offered low-end products too, cameras hardly built to last. But thats marketing for you.
Nikon was discovered and elevated to this mythical status by American press photographers

As Canon Inc. said in its press release:
By the way, we finally decided to end sales for the film single lens reflex camera EOS-IV.
That by the way sounds as if Canon feared being rebuked by fiercely loyal EOS users. It will continue to repair EOS models till 2025. But a French photojournalist I met recently told me that in France, many young photographers prefer to use film-loading cameras, with film processing labs available in all cities, and there would be plenty of EOS and older Canon workhorses like the FT and FTb, Canon F, AE-1, A1 and T 90 available to enthusiasts. If that is the case in France, it may be similar all over Europe.
My FTb with its fully manual controls (with a tiny battery just for the light meter) was already archaic in the 1980s, with photographers cockily carrying their Nikon F3s and FM2s, Pentax K-1000s or (more rarely over here) Canon AE-1s or A-1s to work.
That match-needle metering system was restored to life buy a quiet genius who had a repair shop at Bristol Street, Fort. It required only a cheap Mercury Oxide 1. 35v battery the size of a 25 cents coin (Remember those Anyone). They say todays DSLRs have greater computing power than the Apollo 11 space mission.
The FTb was designed when the first IBM desktop was still science-fiction and produced really good images provided you knew how to recognize a good picture when you saw it. It had mirror lock and a shutter with very low vibration. It was the platform on which all other legendary Canon cameras which followed were based.
Good luck to those who need computers to take photographs.
In the midst of that 80s electronic glitter (albeit in plastic bodies except for the metal body Nikon F3) the metal body FTb with its pre-ergonomics styling worked without grumbling. Just to test its limits, I once wrapped it in cellophane and stored it in the deep-freezer for a day.
Feeling just a little damp after being taken out, it worked perfectly, and does to this day, the whirring beauty of its clockwork mechanical shutter sweet music to ones ears.
It could even be conceivably used in self-defense if it came to the crunch. One can imagine the prosecuting lawyer telling an incredulous judge: Your Honour, this man, under the guise of photographing the world at large, harboured murderous intentions, and we have ample proof here in the form of this metal brick thinly disguised as a camera.
It isnt just Canon or Nikon or Pentax which made good cameras in the film-loading era. All major camera makers offered a range, from high end to low. The top dogs of the camera business, mostly Japanese except for Leica, Kodak, Voigtlander and a handful of others, too, made rather simple-minded cameras along with the legends, even awful ones.
My FTb with its fully manual controls (with a tiny battery just for the light meter) was already archaic in the 1980s, with photographers cockily carrying their Nikon F3s and FM2s, Pentax K-1000s
My first Canon, the low-end AL-1, had nothing distinguished about it. But, as with many other things, cameras have their mystique, and not all cameras have it even if the quality may be very good.
Thats why a handful of camera makers become the top dogs of the business, just as it is with photographers. Some are immensely successful and achieve mythical status, while the others are just photographers. I guess thats life.
To wind this up, I have lost two Canons in my life. One, a friends prized A-1, when I forgot it on top of my car on a hotel parking lot. Repaying that debt left me broke for a while. The other was a Canon AE-1, bought cheap when film-loading cameras were no longer fashionable.
I left it behind with my backpack after photographing the scenery along the Ella-Wellawaya Road. When I remembered a couple of minutes later and returned, it was gone. Im happy to say my memory has improved tremendously with age.
Canon EOS was so pricey when the range came out that I didnt even dream of buying one. A few years ago, one of these gentlemen photographers who return from work overseas with expensive cameras exchanged his now idling Canon EOS for an old violin.
It was for his daughter and I hope shes still using it. That EOS was shelved when I stopped using film, but the cameras in good shape.
People forget that cameras are only as good as their lenses. Some of my best photos were taken with a Zenit, a camera derided by our professionals. Anyone of free market orientation could claim that, like much of those cheap goods mass produced in classless societies, they were shoddy.
The brand new Zenit I bought for two thousand rupees in the mid-90s broke down after a couple of years, and the camera technician told me it wasnt worth the repair. But I kept using the screw-threaded Helios lens with the 60s vintage Asahi Pentax discovered for sale in the technicians window, and it can compare with the best of Japanese lenses. Later, I found an adapter ring which allowed the Russian lenses to be used on Canon bodies.
And so it is with Canon or whatever demi-god camera one may buy. Without the best of lenses, the pictures wont be worth much (technically speaking; artistry is another matter, something money cant buy) and these days you need a bank loan to get the perfect match.
I miss my Rs. 2,000 Zenit, Rs. 5,000 FTb, the Rs. 6,000 Pentax and my bartered EOS. They dont deserve to be sitting there on the shelf, doing nothing.
As for the end of film photography, though, one can imagine Canon (and other camera makers) resuming a limited production of their film cameras just as new record players are being made and millions of new vinyl records are pressed out of old East German machinery shipped to the UK and elsewhere.

Allegations against 118 MPs: Fabricated stories, tarnishing MPs image:Speaker
	
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya told Parliament today that fabricated stories and statements made by various people had tarnished the image of MPs, Parliament and the country as a whole.
In a special statement he said the police had informed him that they had not questioned any personal security officer of any MP.
He also categorically stated that there were no lists of MPs or of any others who were alleged to have carried out any transaction with Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. owner Arjun Aloysius and as such requested the media and others to refrain from misleading the public.
I request the media and everyone concerned not to make baseless allegations which goes into the extent of accusing respected members of civil society, accusing 118 MPs, later increasing it to 166, of having taken bribes, the Speaker said.
He said the relevant institutions had informed him that there was no list containing names of any MPs and of others and that the police had informed him that it had not questioned any personal security officer of any MP.
 I recall how the country went into flames after rumours were spread of potato curry containing contraceptives and like to state that todays situation in the country is equally dangerous, the Speaker said.
He said there was no necessity for any MP to produce affidavits to certify that they had not taken money and to make statements to the media.
The Speaker said he had asked Presidential Secretary Austin Fernando to send him all the sections of the presidential commission report and that he would do so when he returns from overseas.(Yohan Perera)

100-day programme - Drafted by panel of eminent persons: Rajitha
	
Cabinet Spokesman and Minister, Rajitha Senaratne said yesterday the unity governments 100-day programme was drafted by a panel of eminent persons during the 2015 presidential election campaign.
He said President Maithripala Sirisena might not have had an opportunity of studying it in depth because he was involved in a vital propaganda campaign.
The minister, commenting on the remarks made by the President recently on the 100-day programme said what he actually meant was that he did not have the time to discuss the this programme with the committee members or constituent partners of the United National Front because of his busy schedule.
He said former president Mahinda Rajapaksa had returned to Carlton in Hambantota and Basil had fled the country to US and that there was no hurry to announce immediate parliamentary polls by the morning of January 9, 2015. It was against this background that the President and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe agreed to the 100-day programme.
Responding to journalists at yesterdays Cabinet news briefing, the minister said the joint opposition was in disarray and the splits within the JO and SLPP were getting worse by the day.
Journalist:
There are media reports that the cracks are kept widening within the JO and SLPP. Are you happy as a front-liner of the yahapalana government
Minister:
Not really. Our focus is on the reorganization and strengthening of the UNF to successfully face the forthcoming PC, presidential and general elections. I have heard that the JO meeting called by former president Mahinda Rajapaksa was not attended by many of the JO leaders like Dinesh Gunawardana.
Journalist:
Media reports say the candidacy of Gotabaya Rajapaksa to run for the presidency in 2020 has not been accepted by many like Vasudeva Nanayakkara.
Minister:
Yes, we must unite all like-minded politicians and political parties under one roof to ensure our victory.
Journalist:
Both, the President and the Prime Minister have hinted on their candidacy for the presidential poll in 2020. On whose side are you
Minister:
My mission is to unite the SLFP and the UNP and the two leaders. We must select either of them for the presidential polls in 2020 to ensure our victory. Divisions mean disaster.
Journalist:
The people, the politicians and the media are questioning the sustainability of the unity government after the negative remarks made by the President on the governments 100-day programme and giving helicopters to Mahinda and his family to go home on January 9, 2015. Where and when is this going to end
Minister:
Dont worry. The yahapalana government is as strong as ever. The differences and arguments are common in any coalition. You may remember that the coalition governments under Mr. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike in 1956 and Madam Bandaranaike in 1960 faced more serious problems. The splits in 50s ultimately led to the assassination of Mr. Bandaranike. In comparison to them the differences in this government are negligent.
Journalist:
Are you confident that the yahapalana government will complete its entire term of office until 2020.
Minister:
Yes, indeed.
Minister Gayantha Karunatilaka:
Not only up to 2020 but beyond it.
Journalist:
The UNP won the vote held to elect a deputy speaker on Tuesday in Parliament. Your comments
Minister:
That victory reflects the true political situation in the country and whom the people are with. The parliamentary tradition in Sri Lanka up to now is to elect the Speaker and the Deputy from the government side and chairman of committees by the opposition. When the deputy speakers post fell vacant, the SLFP proposed its Jaffna district MP Angajan Ramanathan for the post but the TNA opposed. Then after the Prime Minister proposed the name of Ananda Kumarasiri for the post and President Sirisena proposed Sudharshini Fernandopulles name. But Mr. Wickremesinge said the UNP had already proposed Mr. Kumarasiris name and therefore the UNP could not support Dr. Fernandopulle. That is why a ballot was held and UNPs Mr. Kumarasiri won with a big margin which indicates the strength of the UNP.
Journalist:
Chief Minister C.V.Wigneswaran and PC member Sivajilingam have launched an agitation campaign in support of the LTTE. Is there no one in the government to shut the mouths of these two terrorists
Minister Senaratne:
These people live on racism and extremism. They dont know or have no confidence in democratic methods to win their demands.
Journalist:
Why is the government not taking action against their racist utterances
Minister:
We must enact the law banning hate speech. There were attempts to introduce this law but it was not successful.(Sandun A Jayasekera)

FB staff to learn Sinhala insults after Sri Lanka riots
	
Three months after Sri Lanka was rocked by deadly anti-Muslim riots fuelled by online vitriol, Facebook is training its staff to identify inflammatory content in the country's local languages, AFP reported.
The social network has been seeking penance in Sri Lanka after authorities blocked Facebook in March as incendiary posts by Buddhist hardliners fanned religious violence that left three people dead and reduced hundreds of mosques, homes and businesses to ashes.
Until the week-long ban, appeals to Facebook to act against the contagion of hate speech had been met with deafening silence, at a time when the California-based tech giant was reeling from unprecedented global scrutiny over fake news and user privacy.
"We did make mistakes and we were slow," Facebook spokeswoman Amrit Ahuja told AFP in Colombo.
The dearth of staff fluent in Sinhala - the language spoken by Sri Lanka's largest ethnic group - compounded the issue, with government officials and activists saying the oversight allowed extremist content to flourish undetected on the platform.
Ahuja said Facebook was committed to hiring more Sinhala speakers but declined to say how many were currently employed in Sri Lanka.
"This is the problem we are trying to address with Facebook. They need more Sinhala resources", said the island's telecommunications minister Harin Fernando.
Since the violence broke out in March, two high-level delegations from the company have visited Sri Lanka, where ethnic divisions linger after decades of war, to assure the government of its intent.
Ahuja said Facebook was working with civil society organisations to familiarise its staff with Sinhala slurs and racist epithets.
Complex local nuances have added to the challenge. The word for "brother" in Tamil - also an official language in the country - can be a derogatory term in Sinhala when a slight inflection is used.
Ahuja said Facebook has since taken down "hate figures and organisations" in Sri Lanka including the Bodu Bala Sena, a radical Buddhist outfit that is blamed for attacks against Muslims in recent years.

Govt. intent on bringing Udayanga, Jaliya to justice: PM
	
The government has stepped up its efforts to bring former diplomats Jaliya Wickramasuriya and Udayanga Weeratunga to justice, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament yesterday.
PM Wickremesinghe said this in response to a question raised by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake in this regard in the House last morning.
Mr. Wickremesinghe said Jaliya Wickramasuriya had been charged with misusing US dollars 300,000 by claiming that the money was spent to purchase a new building to be used as the Sri Lankan Embassy in the US.
He said the Financial Crimes Investigation Department (FCID) had taken over the case and notice was issued for him to appear in court.
A warrant has been issued seeking his arrest as he had failed to report to court as per the notice issued, the Prime Minister said, adding that subsequently search warrants were obtained to check the assets, including the bank accounts, of Wickramasuriya.
He said Udayanga Weeratunga has been charged with committing a fraud with regard to the purchase of MIG aircraft from Ukraine.
He was thought to be hiding in the U.A.E at present. The government is working closely with the U.A.E government to bring him to face justice in Sri Lanka after a warrant was issued for his arrest.
The Prime Minister said notices have been issued to prevent Weeratunga's lands in Dompe from being sold until the case against him is over. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Govt. to review FTA with China : Malik
	
The Sri Lankan government will hold ministerial level talks with China to review and iron out contentious issues in the proposed Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the two countries, Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama said.
He told Daily Mirror yesterday he would seek a meeting either in Beijing or here in August to discuss how to proceed with the FTA with China.
"We have made representations to the Chinese government and are awaiting its response," he said.
The FTA was initiated by the Rajapaksa regime. The two sides also appointed negotiating teams. However, there was a change after the new government took office in 2015.
Sri Lanka has already pledged its support to Chinas Belt and Road initiative. The government recently signed a FTA with Singapore and had held several rounds of talks with India for an Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) . (Kelum Bandara)

IGP has authority to suspend officers charged with criminal offence - Police Spokesman
	
Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said the Inspector General of Police (IGP) has the legal authority to suspend any police officer who was charged for criminal offences, without prior approval from the National Police Commission (NPC).
Recent reports questioned the move of the IGP to suspend the duties of Ampara-Kalmunai Division Superintendent of Police (SP) Priyadarshana Herath due to the requirement of NPC's approval with regard to the appointments, transfers and suspensions of officers above the rank of OICs.
Responding to this, the spokesman said the SP was suspended after an indictment was served against him under the Torture Act on May 22 at the Anuradhapura Magistrates Court, in connection with an incident in 2009, in which the SP had allegedly assaulted a suspect in remand custody.
He said SP Herath was suspended in connection with another offence in in 2017 and reinstated by the NPC last month following an appeal.
According to the 27/10 clause of the 48 paragraph/ section II of the Establishment Code, if a court case was filed against an officer in connection with a criminal offence, the service of the official could be suspended immediately. Also, based on the 31/1 clause of the Establishment Code, the Department Head has the authority to suspend the officer under Covering Approval," he said.
The spokesman said the Easter Province Senior DIG had informed the IGP that the indictment has been served against SP Herath and on Saturday (June 2) the IGP has suspended the service of the SP under Covering Approval.
A letter has been sent to the NPC on Monday (June 4) informing the decision and SP Herath was suspended according to the legal procedure, he said. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Keith Noyahr abduction and assault: CID taken to task for lack of progress
	
When the Keith Noyahr abduction and assault case was taken up in Mount Lavinia Magistrate's Court yesterday (6), the CID was reprimanded by Additional Magistrate Lochana Abeywickrama for repeating the facts provided to court on the last date of hearing instead of submitting new evidence which would help the case to move forward.
When the case was taken up in Courts, Defense Counsel Malka Deneththi informed the Magistrate in further reports that the CID was repeating the same facts and it had not completed its investigations.
The CID also requested the Magistrate to make an order for them to record a further statement from the eighth suspect of the case, retired Major General Amal Karunasekara. The Magistrate made the order.
Seven suspects who were previously released on bail were presented in court along with Major Bulathwatta of the Military Intelligence Corps who was arrested later and was the eighth suspect in the case. (Yoshitha Perera)

Minister should obtain approval to import vaccines: GMOA
	
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne should obtain the approval of the Sri Lanka College of Oncologists (SLCO) before importing foreign cancer treatment vaccines, the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) said yesterday.
GMOA Vice President and Consultant Gynaecologic Oncologist Dr. Sarada Kannangara told Daily Mirror that oncology was a specialised area that required the approval of not only the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) but also the SLCO.
Dr. Kannangara said it was not informed that the minister had sought approval of the SLCO to introduce cancer treatment vaccines to the country.
It is unethical if the minister wishes to import cancer treatment vaccines by depending only on the NMRA. There are no different brands to cancer treatment drugs, but only bio similarity drugs. So trials should be conducted on each product. If it is an antibiotic, then there is no harm in purchasing low-priced drugs, but complications may occur when using a bio similarity oncology drug. Therefore, it should be recommended by an expert oncology body in the country. It is vital that this committee consists of a number of oncologists to examine the new drug. We urge the minister and relevant authorities to reveal the approvals obtained to bring down new drugs, he said.
Minister Senaratne recently said that he was in the process of registering two new foreign cancer treatment vaccines. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Mobile App to end all forms of ragging in Uni's launched
	
An application (App) for mobile devices has been launched for state university students to instantly inform the authorities of ragging incidents as a step to eradicate theragging menace from universities, Higher Education Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said yesterday.
Minister Rajapakshe told Daily Mirror that all state university students in the country had access to this application and they could inform the University Grants Commission (UGC) of ragging incidents via the App.
He said this application was available 24 hours of the day and added that the UGC would be monitoring it and could identify the students current location at all times.
He also said the local police in the relevant area would be alerted as soon as any student sends a distress call about an ongoing ragging incident and were expected to respond immediately.
Any student can download this application starting from yesterday and we urge them to make use of the technology, developed by Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) at the Ministrys request, to inform the authorities without delay, he said.
He said ragging in universities was on the rise with many serious incidents, including sexual harassment, not even being reported.
In total around 280 ragging incidents were reported to have taken place in state universities last year which were not reported to the police due to various issues. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

## Title: More on Constituting Buddhism in 1972  Who erred;  Sirimavo or Colvin
## Section: Opinion
## Date: 7 June 2018 12:00 am
More on Constituting Buddhism in 1972  Who erred;  Sirimavo or Colvin
	
I thank Dr. Nihal Jayawickrama for his educative and comprehensive observations on May 25, in response to my article of May 22 titled, From Dominion Status to Sovereign Sri Lankaappeared on Republican Day. Dr. Jayawickrama says,
Sirimavo, not Dr. Colvin who gave Buddhism the Foremost Place in the 1972 Constitution
	Sirimavo made no reference whatsoever to the Kandyan Convention
	Considerable demand in the country for Buddhism as a State religion
K.K.S. Pereras article headlined From Dominion Status to Sovereign Sri Lanka published on May 22 appears to contain an inaccurate statement regarding the provision relating to Buddhism in the 1972 Constitution. I refer in particular to the statement: In 1972, PM Sirimavo Bandaranaike being mindful of Article 5 of the 1815 Kandyan Convention, had directed Dr. Colvin R. de Silva to provide the foremost place to Buddhism. In all the discussions I had with Sirimavo Bandaranaike on matters relating to the proposed Constitution, she made no reference whatsoever to the Kandyan Convention. Nor did she do in the Committee of the Constituent Assembly that considered the issue of Buddhism, which included among its members both Dr. Colvin R. de Silva and Dudley Senanayake. The Kandyan Convention was invoked in that committee by the Mahanayake Theras of the Malwatta and Asgiriya Chapters Their submissions were rejected by the committee which incidentally was chaired by Sirimavo Bandaranaike. In December 1970, the Premier drew the attention of the Constitutional Affairs Minister to the summary of representations received by his ministry from the public which indicated that there appears to be considerable demand in the country for Buddhism as a State religion and for the protection of its institutions and traditional places of worship.
Buddhism was the State Religion and had been afforded the Foremost Place and the famous Kandyan Convention of 1815 had provided in its Article 5 that the Buddhist religion shall be held inviolable
On March 11, 2011, a Special Correspondent in The Island writing under, Who providedBuddhism the Foremost Place in Sri Lankas Constitution, says, I quote,
At the well-attended launch of his text on Buddhist Ecclesiastical Law at the PIM on February 15, 2011 , Dr. Weerasooria said that he had been told and he has so recorded in his text that it was the then Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike and not Dr. Colvin R. de Silva who gave Buddhism the Foremost Place in the 1972 Constitution.
Interestingly, many people wonder why Dr. Colvin, an ardent Marxist, who was responsible for the first 1972 Republican Constitution provided the Foremost Place to Buddhism in its Sixth Article: See [29.3]. This Article was followed in the 1978 Constitution. When writing this text, this author was reliably informed of the true background and so records it here.
Dr. Weerasooria said that the Principal Law officers of the State in 1972 were Victor Tennekoon - the Attorney-General and Rajah Wanasundera - Solicitor General. Rajah Wanasundera (later an Attorney General and Supreme Court Judge) had told him that it was Sirimavo Bandaranaike that had wanted a Constitutional provisions giving Buddhism the Foremost Place provided in the 1972 Constitution and that Dr. Colvin had no option but to insert it.
He also said that until the cession of the Kandyan Kingdom to the British in 1815, Buddhism was the State Religion and had been afforded the Foremost Place and the famous Kandyan Convention of 1815 had provided in its Article 5 that the Buddhist religion shall be held inviolable and that all that Sirimavo Bandaranaike did in the 1972 Constitution was to incorporate that same recognition.
SG Wanasundera was also one of the Guests of Honour at this book launch and was on the podium when Dr. Weerasooria made these submissions to the audience. Unquote. 
Buddhist Ecclesiastical Law, a colossal 850-page text authored by the well-known lawyer, diplomat and legal academic, Dr. Wickrema Weerasooria was launched on February 15, 2011, at the Postgraduate Institute of Management. The text provides a comprehensive coverage of the subject of Buddhist Law in Sri Lanka and as an English text it is considered a global first. The writer recorded the relevant passage 20:23 A from Chapter 29, which reads as.
.Chapter 29 --How the foremost place for Buddhism was put in 1972 Constitution
In 1972, PM Sirimavo Bandaranaike being mindful of Article 5 of the 1815 Kandyan Convention, had directed Dr. Colvin R. de Silva to provide the foremost place to Buddhism
[20:23 A]--It was done on the initiative of the then Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike. When discussing the provisions for the 1972 Constitution with the States Principal Law officers, Attorney General Victor Tennekoon and Solicitor General Rajah Wanasundera, the Premier, mindful of Article 5 of the Kandyan Convention, had requested the Law Officers to draft an appropriate clause and had then directed Dr. Colvin to incorporate it in the new Constitution. He had no option but to do so. However, in his inimitable manner, he had quipped she is thrusting the Kandyan Throne into our Constitution.-- page: 791
In an authoritative account titled, Reflections on the Making and Content of the 1972 Constitution: An Insiders Perspective- Nihal Jayawickrama: Centre for Policy Alternatives - (2012), the author affirms Dr. Weerasooriyas position on involvement of Attorney General Victor Tennekoon and Solicitor General Rajah Wanasundera on the role they played in convincing the Prime Minister on necessary amendments to draft prepared by Dr. Colvin. [the author himself, a Prime Ministers confidante who assumed Justice Ministrys Permanent Secretary position at the age of 32 in1970, was also a member of the committee that drafted it]. The author says, I quote,
In late November 1970, I wrote a confidential letter to the Prime Minister expressing my concerns. In it, I stated, inter alia, The Constitution, unlike any other law, is expected to survive the lifetime of many generations and the vicissitudes of political thought.
It must therefore be a Constitution of the People in which and through which their basic rights which are not delegated to their representatives are protected and preserved. It should be possible for a parliamentarian of today, if he were to find himself a private citizen two years hence, to be able to say that the Constitution affords him the same protection which he received from it in the days when he ruled under it. I am sorry to say that in my view, the Basic Resolutions envisage the creation of a very rigid Constitution of Peoples Representatives which will afford them absolute protection while they continue to wield absolute power. To me, this is a frightening prospect. To this letter I attached my detailed comments on the draft basic resolutions and my suggestions for their amendment. The Prime Minister responded immediately. She asked me to convene a meeting with the Attorney General, Victor Tennekoon Q.C., on the following morning, December 1, 1970, at Temple Trees. At that meeting, which was also attended by Rajah Wanasundera and Noel Tittewela from the Attorney-Generals Department unquote.
The Constitution, unlike any other law, is expected to survive the lifetime of many generations and the vicissitudes ofpolitical thought
PMs letter to Dr. Colvin; dated December 9, 1970
Dr. Jayawickrama further says, Finally, she requested the Attorney General and me to prepare a draft letter setting out her views, as made known to us, which she wished to address to the Minister of Constitutional Affairs.
Extracts from the letter, I have glanced through a summary of representations received by your Ministry from the public. I find from these and other sources that there appears to be a considerable demand in the Country for Buddhism as a State Religion, and for the protection of its institutions and traditional places of worship.
Some provision will have to be made in the new Constitution regarding these matters without, at the same time, derogating from the freedom of worship that should be guaranteed to other religions
Writers experience
In late 1970s, I got an opportunity to attend a panel discussion organized by a Tamil political movement based in Colombo, and held at Ramakrishna Hall, Wellawatte on a topic related to Constitutions of Sri Lanka and minority rights. Apart from the two main panelists, J.R. Jayewardene and Dr. Colvin R. de Silva, there were either Amirthalingam or Sivasittamparam representing the Federal Party and a Muslim Politician from the East. Colvin answering a question from audience on inclusion of special place for Buddhism, spoke about a letter he had received from his PM as head of the committee and Minister of Constitutional Affairs. She had indirectly hinted on the importance of incorporating Foremost place in the new draft and Colvin instead of making a formal reply, had either met the PM or phoned her to persuade her on the unsuitability of such a clause in the light of section on equal rights for all citizens guaranteed in it. 
Then she had quoted the two Chief Prelates of Siyam Maha Nikaya, who enlightened her through an emissary, how a Colonial Governor on his own included the Article 5 in Kandyan Convention in 1815 giving foremost place for Buddhism. She had even inquired Colvin for the Governors name. On being told that it was Robert Brownrigg, the same man who ordered, Slaughter every man, woman, and child during Uva-Wellassa uprising three years later, she had responded, But, Colvin, Brownrigg had no difficulty in granting it; you, being a Sinhala-Buddhist is making an issue of it. [Something to that effect: the writer cannot recollect the exact words the PM had spoken]. Winding up his reply to the audience Colvin said, she was thrusting the Kandyan Throne into our Constitution
What exactly they propose, intend to effect or their visions, the Heads of State in most instances would refrain from using the official channels, Cabinet meetings, exchange of notes and memorandums, instead they usually convey the idea to a minister over a casual chat or through a third party loyal to them and who is within the inner circle [Kitchen Cabinet], which invariably leads to contradictions in official position and the truth.

## Title: National reconciliation is our condition To any presidential candidate who seeks our support

National reconciliation is our condition To any presidential candidate who seeks our support
	
Leader of Eelam Peoples Democratic Party (EPDP) and Jaffna district MP Douglas Devananda, in an interview with Daily Mirror, speaks about the Mullivaikkal commemoration, the provincial council system and the next presidential election:
Some Tamil politicians exploiting Mullivaikkal commemoration for political ends

Minority communities disillusioned with Govt.

NPC is doing nothing

TNA is split

Sufficient progress not made
	People are disgusted with TNA
	Power devolution needed for Tamils
Q In the north, Mullivaikkal Remembrance Day was observed. It has given rise to speculation that the LTTE ideology is gaining ground again in the north. How do you see
There is no inclination among ordinary people towards such an ideology. Be that as it may, certain politicians try to impose it on people. I also brought a motion to Parliament proposing to build a monument in memory of all those who died during the war. I also sought to designate a particular date to remember them. The Defence Ministry responded to me saying that such a monument could be erected in the Anuradhapura area. There is an attempt by some politicians in the north to make political gains on this matter. We are opposed to such political meddling. It is peoples right to remember their loved ones who died. 
Q How would incidents like these affect communal harmony in the country from your perspective
When the northern politicians indulge in such activities with political motif, they evoke resistance from southern politicians for the same purpose.
Q How will it affect the future
We noticed the kind of publicity being given to Tamil National Alliance (TNA) member of the Northern Provincial Council (NPC) M. K. Sivajilingam. When he lit the oil lamp at the commemoration event, we saw him being flanked by four persons only. There are politicians acting with vested interests in both sides. It will create problems in the future as I can see. 
Q In the south, it is a day of victory. In the north, it is a day of mourning. Wont it polarize the two communities further
The current government had realized it at the beginning. Yet, it is no longer the case with the government now. In other countries, there are victory day celebrations. Those are military victories gained from fighting with external forces. Here, it is different. It was a war between two groups of the same country. Initially, this government wanted to avoid the polarization of the two communities on these lines. It is a different situation now. 
Q How do you see the performance of the government in terms of reconciliation between the communities
I dont think there is sufficient progress made in this direction. It is doubtful whether those politicians and officials assigned with the task of achieving reconciliation did their bit properly. 
Q The elections to the Northern Provincial Council are due this year. The TNA is virtually divided with Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran threatening to break away. How does your EPDP assess the situation
We have decided to contest the elections. If Mr. Wigneswaran contests alone, the TNA vote bank will be divided. We can gain then. The TNA made a whole lot of promises, but did not deliver on them. So, people are disgusted with them. We have to win over these people now. 
When the northern politicians indulge in such activities with political motif, they evoke resistance from southern politicians for the same purpose
Q You stood for the 13th Amendment to the Constitution right from the beginning. You said the implementation of PC system would make way for the resolution of the political question. Yet, there is a perception in the country that the PC system is a white elephant. What is your view
We insisted that the 13th Amendment should be implemented in full as the basis for the resolution of the Tamil peoples political question. When the trust is built between the communities through such implementation, we can go for the next step in addressing the Tamil national question. 
Q People say the system is a gimmick. Your comments...
There are different opinions. Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera once disclosed how he made use of the system to do work as the then Chief Minister of the NWPC. Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray also said he did a lot of work as the Chief Minister of the WPC. Actually, the NPC is doing nothing. Those at the provincial council serve their self-interests and enjoy benefits. We cannot go by the NPC and dub the entire provincial council system as a white elephant. 
Q What do you think about the power devolved to the provincial councils at the moment
We need a unit of power devolution for Tamil people. We insist on the provincial council system as a result. People in other parts of the country should decide whether they need such a system or not. We ask for the implementation of the 13th Amendment in full. 
Q When you say the implementation in full, what does it mean
All the powers outlined in the 13th Amendment should be given to the provincial councils. There are land and police powers. Some devolved powers have been taken back by the centre through legal actions. Those powers should also be returned to the provincial councils. 
Q What are the areas of power taken back in this case
There are powers related to agrarian services, cooperative services etc. 
Q At the last presidential election in 2015, the Tamil and Muslim parties played a decisive role. The Presidential Elections is due next year. There are talks about possible candidates. How do you look to the next election
There is a school of thought in the south that executive presidency should be abolished. We believe in the concept that the voters of the entire country should have the chance to participate in an election for the selection of the President to govern them. Then only, Tamil peoples problems can be directed to the President to be elected. 
Also, we are concerned how far the successive Presidents who served in the past addressed the issues confronting Tamil people. There are several names being floated as possible candidates for the next election. We wait patiently. We will decide on our stand depending on the candidates to be nominated by the parties concerned. The minority communities thought this government would address their problems. Their hopes are now shattered. 
Q Do you mean to say that the minority communities are disillusioned with the government
Yes.
Q People talk about former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa as the next presidential candidate. What is your view
People view it with a question mark. If he comes forward, we have to look at his manifesto. 
Q What are your conditions for any candidate seeking presidency
Our condition is to achieve national reconciliation practically on the ground. We will support a candidate capable of delivering it in the real sense. There should be equality among the ethnic groups. They should be able to live with dignity. Our people continue to suffer. They need a political solution that guarantees equal rights for them. Tamil politicians always claim that Sinhala leaders did nothing for Tamil people. We believe Tamil political leaders also did not act in a manner that would encourage the Sinhala leaders to work for Tamil people. That is our feeling. If the Tamil leaders acted in that manner, most problems could have been resolved. Tamil leaders should instill trust in the minds of Sinhala people to create conducive atmosphere for the resolution of Tamil peoples problems. 
As for the Mullivaikkal incident, it does not matter if people voluntarily commemorate their loved ones. What matters is the fact that some politicians try to make use of the event for their ends. Political meddling onlycreates problems.

The court adjourned hearing for a month.
In 2013, the government had paid Rs16 million for the release of approximately 271 Pakistanis  who were jailed despite completing their sentences due to non-payment of fines.
The Foreign Office had stated that 77 prisoners in Dubai were freed between May and June 2013 after payment of approximately Rs8.8 million.
Additionally, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had paid more than Rs1.3 million for one-way air tickets of 32 destitute Pakistanis for their repatriation from Kuala Lumpur in April, 2013.

Department at 4 pm today said.
It also said, strong gusty winds up to 60 kmph can be expected over the island particularly in the Southern, Central, Northern, North-central and North-western Provinces and the Monaragala District as well.
Meanwhile, the National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) today issued a level one landslide warning for the Ratnapura, Kegalle and Nuwara-Eliya Districts. Those residing in these landslide prone areas were asked to be vigilant.
Meanwhile, due to an earth embankment collapsing vehicular movement along the Colombo-Diyagala Main Road and the Nawalapitiya-Ginigathhena Road had come to a standstill today.
Accordingly, two sluice gates of the Laxapana Dam were opened today due to the build-up of water in the dam, while the Wimalasurendra Reservoir was also reported to have reached spill level. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

RTI  is a non-violent way of change
	
Without information we humans, the most advanced species on Earth, would be handicapped. Information is everywhere, but whether they are credible and valid remains a question. Freedom of expression and the Right to Information (RTI) have been topics tabled for decades with no proper implementation. Both these avenues have been newer expressions of the post-war era and Sri Lanka is making steady progress as at now. 
One year after the enactment of the RTI Act Sri Lanka recently reached third place in the Global RTI Index thus becoming the first South Asian country to achieve this target. Throughout the South Asian region the enactment of the RTI Act has been a herculean task and various individuals have risked their lives to make it a reality. Nikhil Dey is one such social activist of Indian origin, known for his struggles to promote the RTI Act in India and the founder of MazdoorKishan Shakti Sangthan (MKSS) in 1987, an organisation that works to ensure minimumwages for workers. 
During a recent visit toSri Lanka, Dey in a candid interview with the Daily Mirror, related his experiences in enacting the Act, the importance of RTI andthe way forward. 
Excerpts:
RTI is vital for the fight against corruption
	democratic politics needs the development of a different kind of politics
	It has been recorded that there are 70 lakhs of RTI applications annually
	The Global Index considers only the quality of law and not the quality of implementing
	In India more than 70 people have been killed as means of RTI usage
	Now a decision has been made by the Government of India to make every RTI available appear on the website
Q Why is an RTI Act important for countries such as India and Sri Lanka that are plagued with corruption
I think RTI is vital for the fight against corruption. If you dont have transparency you dont have access to information. Its only access to information that can drive a transparent structure. You can do anything in a country with so many inequalities, different regions and climactic conditions. All South Asian countries face similar types of challenges. Society too has all kinds of issues including gender and different access to power. So corruption and arbitrary exercises raise many questions in the minds of the public. If you have democracy as a system then its one of the most powerful ways in which you can intervene in governance, ask questions, demand answers and give your opinion. So its the first step to the worlds day-to-day participation. The vote allows you participation once in five years and then you are lost. If you want to keep your elected representative or bureaucracy accountable then RTI is not a sufficient condition, but a very necessary one. RTI connects to an issue and its a battle for removing the imbalances of power. In a democracy imbalance of power is deadly and you need distributed power. So its a non-violent way of change. 
Q What prompted you to be an RTI activist
I come from a privileged background; in fact from a liberal home which said that inequality is wrong, poverty is terrible and that it was around me. It just made me want to do something rather than saying it was wrong and terrible all the time. I thought everything would come out of politics and then I understood that democratic politics needs the development of a different kind of politics. That didnt lead me directly to RTI, but instead I worked with some poor people in a little village in Rajasthan and they are the ones who fed me with the ideas. They related how they are frustrated and showed me where the demands need to be made, so that they would know the truth. 
If civil society agencies and the media could write about it, definitely it will reach the public. It should be written in Sinhala and Tamil too
Q On what issues have RTI being used in India
When we began back in 1992 or 1993 there was no talk about RTI except in certain rooms in seminars. It was a long struggle first to get local government records which took five or six years and then bringing about a state law which took another four to five years and making it an Act took another five years. All the way people used it, but saw the limitations of each law. I think Sri Lanka in many ways has a better law than India. In some places its weaker, but in many places its stronger. It started being used by ordinary people who were demanding their rights for survival which included the right to food, education, wages and their everyday things. People who have never attended school understood the value of this Act. Even the Indian courts have acknowledged it because the Indian law changed it from just a freedom of expression issue to a right to life issue and a right to equality issue. This is because you cannot ensure equal treatment until you know whats happening. Today it is used in a million things; the Prime Ministers office, the Presidents office, the smallest pollution control board office and even departments in ministries. It has been recorded that there are 70 lakhs of RTI applications annually. If you can imagine each RTI application producing such a reaction, 70 lakhs of applications are shaking up the system. 
Q Its been a year since Sri Lanka enacted the RTI law and we have already reached third place in the Global RTI Index. Your comments
The Global Index considers only the quality of law and not the quality of implementing. That is something that needs to be monitored. Even in India, it was the quality of law that was being evaluated. In India there are many shortcomings in implementation and there are sheer numbers of the tenacity of people. In India more than 70 people have been killed as means of RTI usage. This shows how much it has shaken up the system, but it also shows how sharp the reaction is.
I think Sri Lanka is in its early stages and what I feel is that its important to make people aware of its usage. There are people out there with potential RTI applications because they are frustrated, have various issues and have been experiencing various vulnerable problems. In India RTI is now like a verb and it means a lot of things because its about questioning, filing an RTI, getting the records and so on. I think that popularization will take some time and for this the media has to play a significant role. There will be a story in one province or another which needs to come out, so that the others could be inspired by it. In India when we started we were supported by several doyennes of the media industry. They travelled with us and some of them even thanked the ordinary people for fighting a battle the media should have fought.
But even when the law was fast enough certain journalists claimed that they have their sources. Questions were raised as to who would wait for 30 days to get information and so on. But today these sources would ask journalists to file an RTI. In Sri Lanka a person could receive information within 14 days. But this is the outer limit. There have been instances where we have received information within half an hour. Certainly if theres an issue that needs to be written immediately, we cannot wait for an RTI. 
Q What benefits could the society and authorities reap in bringing about the proactive disclosure of information
For the society as a whole it has a huge benefit because if the information is available it has its own effect on preventing corruption. Websites and everything are now turning into digital governance so you can easily make it available to everyone at the click of a button. Data should be open, but it also should be usable. Digital governance therefore allows you to produce those reports and allow anyone to have access to them. That will make governance more efficient, certainly allow people fight and prevent corruption and also make changes in policy because more people could make informed choices. 
Q How could authorities be trained for this
What we have seen is that those training sessions end up being how you can deny information. We dont have that culture of transparency. We have a culture which asks why they should answer a question, who are you to ask me etc. Therefore we need to shift from a culture of secrecy to a culture of transparency. In that RTI and proactive disclosure would help. 
I think Sri Lanka is in its early stages. I feel that its important to make people aware of its usage. There are people out there with potential RTI applications
Q How difficult was it to implement the law in India and what lessons could Sri Lanka learn from it
Still its difficult. It involves continual resistance because the Government would want to amend it and there are others who would give you half answers, delayed answers, scare, threaten and intimidate you. When appeals start going to the commissions they pile up there and people start getting fed up and it loses credibility. We got it after a long struggle and we need to protect it. Its not a sufficient condition to change everything, but it is
absolutely necessary. 
Q As you mentioned earlier, journalists and people who use RTI have risked their lives to bring about a change. How should Governments respond to this situation
The weakest link we have seen is the Government. The Government acts as a progressive, transparent leader that would say nobody should go to the commission and I would file an action against any officer who denies or delays information. That would be a good proactive, transparent administrator. But unfortunately the Government says it will pass a law, its a mistake and lets change it, find ways around it and fight at the commission. Therefore its a continual battle and if you get proactive disclosure systems in then nobody can prevent it as it is automatic. Its now like a grievance-regress mechanism, but you need a follow-up and accountability mechanism. Governments have to go out, provide the information, ask people for their opinions and take action. 
Q The concept of RTI is quite new to Sri Lanka. How could this be familiarised among rural communities
If civil society agencies and the media could write about it, definitely it will reach the public. It should be written in Sinhala and Tamil too. People should know that there is a large civil society group backing them. There were attacks when the Indian RTI law was being passed. It was a powerful law and they tried to amend it within the first year, it was prevented. They tried to amend the rules etc., but none of that has been successful so far. This is because theres a large group of people protecting it because its a peoples law. 
Even the Indian courts have acknowledged it because the Indian law changed it from just a freedom of expression issue to a right to life issue and a right to equality issue
Q Are there instances when RTI could be misused as well
Of course. Any law can be misused particularly if its powerful. The main allegation against RTI is that people could use it to blackmail people. If I know someone is vulnerable and is doing something wrong, I can threaten them with an RTI or I can file an RTI and publicise it. That has happened and because the person concerned has done something wrong, they dont want to complain.
The best answer to that is proactive disclosure because if information comes out automatically then how can blackmailing be done Now a decision has been made by the Government of India to make every RTI available appear on the website including the answers. This way we could keep track of who is filing it and usingthe information.
RTI is an open process and in fact there are instances when people in jails have used RTI and have freed themselves. Many have used it to seek justice; especially those who have had wrong trials against them. You cannot argue against transparency because where there is misuse you should act against it. I feel proud that Sri Lanka has displaced India in this subject and a better competitor and democratic governance is needed.

Sinking  Seema Malaka  shrouded in mystery
	
Mystery surrounds the construction or misconstruction of a Seema Malaka in Diyawanna Oya. To avoid any miscommunication the underscores the fact that this article does not refer to the construction with the same name and situated in Beira Lake.
Authorities assume that the barge must have stuck in the mud that was coming from the adjacent paddy field
	The project was handled by SANKEN to cater to the people in the area to carry out religious activities
	The structure is said to be 4000 square metres with the capacity of accommodating 200 people
Whats cause for concern about the Seema Malaka thats situated in Diyawanna Oya is that this construction is reported to be sinking amid heavy rains and floods in the area. TheDaily MirrorFeatures desk tried to clarify the Seema Malaka issue and find answers to some pertinent questions like; who made it, how it was made and most importantly whose money was used to build this structure. 
There were a few men at the location when the Daily Mirrormade a visit there recently. Those who were there seemed to be supervisors. When inquiries were made they disagreed that Seema Malaka is sinking and added that the structure had tilted a little bit. The time was around 5.00 am when this happened. They also emphasized that the unfinished structure needed about another months work to reach completion. They also said that the construction will be taken to the middle of Diyawanna Oya in keeping with their plans of relocation. 
Project Director Jayawardene said that the sinking was caused by a construction flaw identified in one of the four water-filled barges
They said that the construction work commenced before the rains and the work in being handled by Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (SLLRDC). 
When inquiries were made from the SLLRDC Chairman Roshan Gunawardane, he said that he visited the location following a request by Urban Development Authority (UDA) Chairman Jagath Munasinghe who wished to see whether the sinking structure could be saved. 
Construction flaw
Efforts made to reach UDA Chairman Jagath Munsinghe on his mobile phone proved futile.
Project Director Shameera Jayawardene, an engineer, when contacted said that the sinking was caused by a construction flaw identified in one of the four water-filled barges (empty boxes filled with water) on which the structure stands. According to him the barge had been damaged. They assume that the barge must have stuck in the mud that was coming from the adjacent paddy field. Previously it was only one barge, but now all the barges are stuck in the mud. We have to now check the structure, wood, and iron used in this construction. It will take around three months to complete the construction, he said. 
There are four barges connected to this. They touch the bottom of the lake. We pump out the water in the barges so that the construction can float. This structure is able to float.
We emptied the barges, but the water in one did not empty as planned. With the water level rising in the lake, the barges and the structure got flooded. We have to wait till the water level recedes, to pump out the water and fix the problem associated with the barge. he explained. 
The work of this construction began in January. The work was expected to be completed in September. This accident occurred during the final stages of construction, he noted. 
We dont know for what purpose this building is to be used. It is being built within the UDA premises and we carried on the construction work following a plan given by the UDAs National Physical Planning Department (NPPD), he added. 
The water level has receded to some extent yet it is still over the barges and therefore we have to wait for the water level to drop to the minimum six feet level. 
Describing the incident regarding Seema Malaka at Diyawanna Oya in Kimbulawala, at a recent media briefing, Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said, The project was handled by SANKEN to cater to the people in the area to carry out religious activities and meditate. We approved the project which operates as a private entity and it will be handed over to the Government when completed. 
The minister also noted that these types of Government projects have failed to achieve their purpose many times. He pointing out that the construction of the Cinnamon Gardens roundabout had failed seven times. 
The Minister hinted that during the past contractors had been involved in such meritorious acts for which the money deposited in politicians bank accounts in Seashells or the Virgin Islands was used. 
The UDAs NPPD had provided the architectural support for the project. The structure is said to be 4000 square metres with the capacity of accommodating 200 people. 
SANKEN replies
When theDaily Mirrorcontacted SANKEN Constructions (Pvt) Ltd Managing Director Ranjith Gunatilleke he denied the company being involved in the construction of this facility. 
What is being built in Diyawanna Oya isnt a Seema Malaka even if it resembles one. You are speaking to SANKEN and SANKEN has nothing to do with that, he said. 
When he was informed about the Megapolis Ministers comment that SANKEN handled the project, he said, He would have referred to SANKEN. But actually, this is done by Skills Training and Management Company, an Associate Organization of SANKEN and located in Kaduwela as a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) project using their own funds. 
How can people meditate in such a place I think people are misguided and their talk is guided by the way they think. Not a cent is being provided by the Government, as I know of. Skills Management in Kaduwela, is involved in a lot of CSR projects, Gunatilleke said. 
When asked for further details, he said that further information could be obtained from Skills Training and Management, situated in Kaduwela. Efforts made to reach them through telephone proved futile. 
Later the Daily Mirror learned that Skills Training and Management Company, is chaired by Gunatilleke. 
In the wake of this situation, research done by this newspaper unearthed that the renowned Seema Malaka, which is a part of the Gangaramaya Temple, and located in the Beira Lake, had sunk in 1970s, not long before it was built.

Sketches from the South: A history of schisms
	
The history of the Buddhist clergy, in this country, has largely been a history of schisms, splits, and amalgamations. Over the decades and centuries, several important points have been inferred with respect to this (at one level) inevitable historical process.
First and foremost among them, that the breakdown of Buddhist sects in response to growing caste militancy was a consequence, and not cause, of the political games played by the British after their conquests. Insignificant though this may be, it is nevertheless important in that people tend to paint a rosy picture of caste-ism while forgetting that the rifts between the different castes were exacerbated once the Colonial Office realised it could harness them to its advantage.
As scholars have noted, regardless of their political persuasions, caste-ism, while not rampant in Sri Lanka as it was in India, eventually found its way to the political process.
Caste politics was not unheard of before the advent of the British, but it was institutionalised after it. To a considerable extent, this was reflected in the history of the Buddhist sects, and to an even more considerable extent, the battle over caste in the order was played out between Kandy (the hill country) and the South (the low country).
As scholars have noted, regardless of their political persuasions, caste-ism, while not rampant in Sri Lanka as it was in India, eventually found its way to the political process
In contrast to the conservative, tightly knit Siam Nikaya, which spread out to the Asgiriya and Malwatte Chapters, the Amarapura Nikaya, which was an offshoot of the caste militancy that grew after the Kandyan Kingdom was annexed, was a fairly loose confederation.
As with all such tightly knit sects, however, the Siam Nikaya was bound to give way to the policies of intruders, in this case, the British, whose (deliberately) ambivalent responses to the practices of the Nikaya have been recorded by historians elsewhere.
While a copious recounting of those responses and their historical route is hardly the point of this essay, perhaps a brief, cursory look might enable readers to appreciate how the dominance of one sect had to give way to the dissemination of other sects over the centuries. The timeline relevant to this cursory look, incidentally, spans from 1815, the year of annexation, to 1848, the year of the Matale Rebellion.
When the annexation was complete, assurances were made by the Colonial Office that steps would be taken to preserve the privileges of the traditional elite, which obviously included the monastic orders.
Until then, the politics of the Kandyan Kingdom had followed a largely cyclical process, encompassing shifting loyalties and shifts in the regime (particularly, it can be said, after the Nayakkars began their reign).
But with the advent of the outsider, this was destined to be succeeded by a largely linear process, in which that outsider, the conqueror, managed to concentrate hitherto traditional privileges within his vast bureaucracy.
The traditional elite, naturally anxious to preserve those privileges, sought to preserve them through religion. It was in this context that the Siam Nikaya was guaranteed the continuation of its practices, in part through the much vilified, controversial Kandyan Convention.
No less a person than the then Governor of Ceylon, Robert Brownrigg, visited and placated the nervous monks at the Malwatte and Asgiriya with assurances that the protection and security promised to their religion would never be wanting. John DOyly, Chief Translator and later Baronet of Kandy, made similar assurances and entreaties to the kapuralas of the four devales in Kandy (Kataragama, Pattini, Vishnu, and Natha).
The two promised to undertake three practices which had been the duty of the King: providing food to the temples from the Maha Gabadawa, holding the pageant of the Tooth Relic in Kandy, and maintaining the Dalada Maligawa.
Of the three, the first is the most interesting, since the adherence to and the abrogation of its practice is for me a good indicator of how the Colonial Office affirmed, and later derogated from, the practices of the traditional Kandyan elite.
It took several decades for the British to abscond from taking part in the ceremonies of traditional society in India, and that was a consequence of the Mutiny, which took place in 1857.
In other words, it took an entire Mutiny to turn the British away from Indian life and culture. In Sri Lanka, by contrast, only 17 years were needed for them to renege on their promises regarding that life and culture; by 1832, contrary to the provisions in the Convention, the Colonial Office had elected to do away with the provision of food to the monks, and instead replaced it with a scheme whereby an annual stipend of 310 pounds (or about 30,000 pounds, when adjusted for inflation) would be paid to the temples.
This was an uneasy proposition from the start, and was doomed to stall. It did stall 15 years later, in 1847, when after a campaign against it led by the Legislative Council (which argued that to fund Buddhist monks would be to force a Christian legislature to support heathenism), it was shelved off in favour of a meagre land ownership scheme to benefit the monks.
As no proper arrangements were made for the management of these lands, however, some of them would pass into alien hands.
This same process, of representations to the effect of preserving traditional privileges giving way to their retraction, can be seen even in the way the British took to the pageant and the maintenance of the Maligawa.
By no means did the rebel sects emerge purely because of the activities of the British. Long before Pilimathalawas and Eheliyapolas defections, long before the Chieftains decided to side with the British in a bid to oust the King, those rebel sects were quickly coming up.
Their emergence was conditioned by the regions they originated from. In the hill country, the dominant caste was Govigama; in the outer fringes and the low country, the dominant castes were Salagama, Karava, and Durawa, and in that particular order.
Breakdown of Buddhist sects in response to growing caste militancy was a consequence of the British rule
The Siam Nikaya yielded to the pressures this conundrum necessitated, and years after its founding by Welivita Saranankara, in turn, yielded to the dominant caste.
Upasampada was restricted to this caste (which was not dominant in the low-country, or along the coastal belt). This was true especially when considering how power was distributed in the bureaucracy, prior to the British annexation, between the different castes: while in Kandy the non-Govigama castes had their own headmen, the departments to which they were attached for the performance of their duties were overseen by Govigama chieftains.
These discrepancies, unaddressed for years and decades, had to spill over. They did spill over in 1799 with the founding of the Amarapura Nikaya, which had its biggest following in the South among various groups, ranging from those who felt marginalised by the policies of the Siam Nikaya to those who were tied to British interests and thus wanted to affirm breakaway factions (in the secular or non-secular realm) which were free from the control of the former Kandyan Kingdom.
This was tied to the fact that, while certainly not free from the shackles of colonialism, the South was freer than the hill country and Colombo, and was thus more open to a revolt in the Buddhist order.
(In fact open support was given to the revolt by local headmen, many of whom had repudiated Buddhism and professed Christianity to become part of the bureaucracy.) But while two upasampada ceremonies had been conducted, in 1772 (at the Thotagamuwa Viharaya in Thelwatte) and in 1798 (at Tangalle), these were not endorsed by the conservative monastic elite (which in 1764 conspired to restrict ordination to Govigama; Sitinamaluwe Dhammajoti was the last non-Govigama monk to receive his upasampada at the hands of the Siam Nikaya).
In 1799, therefore, Ambagahapitiya Nanavimala, a Salagama monk who resided in Welithara (a Salagama stronghold), went to Burma with a contingent of five samaneras and three lay devotees.
They stopped at Amarapura, where they were duly ordained in 1800, and from where they returned in 1803 to inaugurate the new sect at Balapitiya. This was the Amarapura Nikaya, and their trek to Burma was financed by a leading entrepreneur from the region, Dines de Zoysa Jayatilaka Siriwardana, most likely an ancestor of Cyril de Zoysa, who would lead the Buddhist revival in the 20th century.
But for this sect to get formal recognition, it needed a stamp of approval from the British in the Maritime Provinces. This could only come about through the efforts of an ally monk, and that monk, also from the Salagama caste, was Kapugama Dhammakhanda. He enjoyed the patronage of the chief headman of his village, Adrian de Abrew, who like de Zoysa was an ancestor of a prominent Buddhist lay revivalist (Peter de Abrew, the founder of Museaus College). Kapugama organised an expedition to Burma on his own account, and in 1807, with the patronage of de Abrew, he set off, to return two years later.
Curiously enough, however, while the objective of the expedition was to gain recognition for the new Nikaya, the certificate of confirmation given to him by the monks at Burma did not make reference to the sect; that would come about in 1825 (a decade after the annexation of Kandy) with an official Act of Appointment given to Nanavimala Thera.
This same process, the British took to the pageant and the maintenance ofthe Maligawa
(The British had commenced the practice of issuing written Acts of Appointment a few years before.)
The reason why Kapugama himself was not handed the Act was simple: in 1816, he rejected Buddhism and became a Christian.
But this act of departure, symbolic though it was, did not, as events later showed, prevent the rise of ideological clashes within the Amarapura Nikaya itself, which I will explore in next weeks piece.

SLPP takes over Maharagama UC
	
The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) list for the election to the Maharagama Urban Council was rejected but managed to get six of its members including former mayor Kanthi Kodikara nominated to the local body yesterday.
After the SLPP nomination list was rejected, the SLPP backed the independent group that contested the polls under the 'bicycle' symbol and won with the backing of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa. There was an agreement that its elected members would resign later making way for the nomination of SLPP members.
Six of its members resigned enabling the SLPP to nominate its members. Mrs. Kodikara who was the team leader of the SLPP was among them.
Her husband Western Province councillor Upali Kodikara told Daily Mirror the other 19 members elected under the bicycle symbol would resign in batches making way for the SLPP to take control of the Maharagama UC. (Kelum Bandara)

Smallest books in colour Book  Facts
	
By Gamini Akmeemana
Dr. Harsha Perera has published the smallest books in colour to be printed in Sri Lanka. They are twins, one in Sinhala and the other in English, titled Mage Rata (My Country) and with illustrations and laminated inside pages. 
The two books mark Dr. Pereras thirtieth year as a writer. Unlike many previously published books of this type, they dont need a magnifying glass to read. The author hopes to achieve a Guinness world record with them.
Reputed chef Pabilis Silva published a very small book (1 cm X 1 cm) to commemorate his 77th birthday. 
The National Library has two miniature dictionaries, English-Dutch and English-German, published in this country in 1964, as well as the Piruwana Poth Wahanse in Sinhala published in 2007. 
The present record for the worlds smallest book is held by Canadian Robert Chaplin, who published a 30-page book the size of a human hair (micrometer 70 X 100) in 2012. Its title is Teeny Ted From Turnip Town and is priced at $15,000.

SriLankan CEO Ratwatte takes early retirement
	
SriLankan Airlines CEO Suren Ratwatte would take an early retirement to facilitate restructuring of the SriLankan Airlines, Chairman Ranjith Fernando announced today.

In a statement, Mr. Fernando said the Board of Directors intend to make some changes in the composition of the top management team and the CEO has agreed to take an early retirement.
There will be a new Chief for the Commercial division. Our fully owned subsidiary, the catering Company, is led by a part time CEO. We have already engaged a new CFO, who will assume office shortly. There will also be some minor reallocation of responsibilities in the organizational structure, he said.
He told SriLankan employees that he was certain that if all give of their best and work together, they will not only restore profitability but be recognized as one of the best airlines in this region, in the short to medium term.
Mr. Fernando said: We cannot continue with the status quo and at the same time restore profitability. We are seriously out of line with the norms in the industry. I intend organizing a briefing session by the consultants for the benefit of the leaders of all trade unions and associations.
We compete with some of the best airlines in the world. Many of them have recourse to unlimited resources. Thus we cannot be very open with all the strategies we intend pursuing. We cannot liberally distribute the restructuring plan, in our own interests".

Full letter

Message from the Chairman to all members of the Staff,
Dear Friends,
A new Board of Directors at the helm of your airline, with the undersigned as its Chairman, has been in office for approximately, the past two months. During this period I have tried to meet, as many of you as possible, in the different locations, in order to explain the perilous financial position the airline is in, and what we can and intend doing to restore viability. Despite that effort, I do realize that I have not been able to meet a large section of the staff yet, and will not be able to do so, soon enough, given the other pressing issues that needs my attention. Hence the need to address all of you in this manner.
Despite the fact that we now have an excellent Board comprising of committed professionals, that alone will not bring about a change in the fortunes of the airline. A return to profitability can only be brought about by all three parties who constitute the airline viz the Owner(the Government), the Board of Directors and the Management and Staff, decide to work tirelessly and in unison, to make that happen. 
The Government as the owner is fully behind the restructuring, and is extremely supportive of this effort. It is my firm belief that the Government will not interfere with the day to day operations of the airline. On the contrary they will extend their fullest cooperation and support as they have willingly done, in the recent past. The Board on its part is fully committed to giving leadership to this effort. They have demonstrated that commitment by voluntarily agreeing not to receive any remuneration from the airline or enjoy any of the perks enjoyed by Directors in the past, till the airline becomes profitable once more. I expect that same commitment from all members of the staff. This is our National carrier. It is the carrier that flies our countrys flag to the rest of the world. It is our duty to protect it, develop it and make it profitable. We have something called pride within all of us. We do not want our airline to be a financial burden on the people of this country, year after year.
All my predecessors in office, past Boards of Directors, and all Management personnel who provided leadership, I presume, have made sincere efforts to restore viability to the airline. But we have been unsuccessful in that effort. Thus quite rightly, the Government as the owner, has sought and obtained the guidance and advice of external Consultants to assist us in that effort. This has been done prior to the new Board assuming office. However I have since discovered that the selection of the consultants has been done in a very transparent manner via public invitations for proposals. I have interacted with the consultants since assuming office and I find them very competent and committed. They comprise of individuals who have extensive experience in the different disciplines within the airline industry. As a firm they have in the recent past, successfully helped turnaround several large and reputed airlines.
But that does not imply that we are bound or obliged to implement all recommendations made by the consultants. The restructuring plan we hope to implement, is not one that is thrust on us by the Government or the Consultants. It will be a plan that we adopt. A plan we believe in. During the past two months our senior staff have been reviewing the plan together with the consultants in order to gain sufficient confidence that the plan is good for the airline, that it is practical and has taken into account our fears and concerns. Having done that, we have now arrived at an agreed set of proposals. What is now left is for us to implement the plan diligently and in a timely manner.
In doing so you have an important role to play. The trade unions and other collective bodies have a role to play. In the first place you must have an understanding of the current state of affairs of the airline and the broad initiatives we intend taking. How we expect things to change What changes we have to bring about What sacrifices we have to make We cannot continue with the status quo and at the same time restore profitability. We are seriously out of line with the norms in the industry. 
I intend organizing a briefing session by the consultants for the benefit of the leaders of all trade unions and associations. You will realize that we operate in a very competitive Global industry. We compete with some of the best airlines in the world. Many of them have recourse to unlimited resources. Thus we cannot be very open with all the strategies we intend pursuing. We cannot liberally distribute the restructuring plan, in our own interests. However we shall brief you adequately on the restructuring plan.
Despite this communique being lengthy, I must refer to one more matter which is critical. It needs only a moments reflection for all of you to realize that the most important decision any Board makes is the appointment of the CEO of the Company and the Senior Management team. It is the CEO and his team that is responsible for conducting the day to day affairs of the company. However good a plan may be, the results derived from it, will depend on how it is implemented. It is the passion that the top team displays, that will invigorate and energize the rest of the staff. The Board intends to make some changes in the composition of the top management team. The current CEO has agreed to take an early retirement. There will be a new Chief for the Commercial division.
Our fully owned subsidiary, the catering Company, is led by a part time CEO. That Company, is a jewel in the crown of the group, in terms of profitability. It requires a full time CEO and our present CF&AO who has been overseeing its operations will move over there, as its full time CEO. We have already engaged a new CFO, who will assume office shortly. There will also be some minor reallocation of responsibilities in the organizational structure.
A final word on the dynamics of CHANGE. Change is always traumatic. All of us today, are in what change management specialists would call the Neutral Zone. The neutral zone is a No mans land between the old and the new. It is the night during which we are disengaged from yesterdays concerns and prepare for the tomorrows. It represents the chaos in which the old form of things dissolves and from which the new form emerges.
This is a stage where each one of you can play an active role, by for instance, identifying what needs to be changed, proposing better and more efficient ways of doing things, identifying new revenue opportunities, cutting down costs, eliminating waste etc. I am certain that if we all give of our best and work together, we will not only restore profitability but be recognized as one of the best airlines in this region, in the short to medium term. 
Yours Sincerely, 
Ranjit Fernando
Chairman

Swearing in of 6 SLPPers -- Opposition says EC biased
	
Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya has violated the new election laws by allowing six SLPP members to replace the six who were elected to the Maharagama UC under the 'Bicycle' symbol, UNP councillor Dhanushka Ramanayake said today.
He told Daily Mirror the swearing in of six SLPP members was a violation of new election laws.
Although Mr. Deshapriya said representatives can only be appointed from those in the ward, those who contested under the bicycle symbol were outsiders. Among the 25 members elected, 17 were from Badalgama, six from Wellawatte and the rest from Kottawa. None of them were within the Maharagama Urban Council limits. Therefore, this is a clear violation of election laws. According to the new election laws, all members should resign to appoint an outsider to the group and such appointments should be made one by one. Section 65 (a) Clause 5 says the consent of the subject minister is needed for such appointments, Mr. Ramanayake said.
He accused Mr. Deshapriya of taking arbitrary decisions and thus allowing the SLPP and the independent group to violate election laws and urged the EC to address this matter without delay. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Syria opens Homs-Hama highway after near  seven-year closure
	

REUTERS, 06th JUNE, 2018-The Syrian government re-opened the highway between the cities of Homs and Hama on Wednesday a month after its forces retook a rebel-held pocket that had straddled the road that was closed for almost seven years.
Motorists waved Syrian flags as they drove down the highway whose re-opening marked a victory for President Bashar al-Assad, who in recent months has taken control of all rebel-held pockets around the capital Damascus as well as the enclave along the highway which had been under siege for years.
From holding less than a fifth of Syria in 2015, Assad, with Russian and Iranian help, has recovered control of the largest chunk of the country.
Without the highway, traffic had to take an indirect route to travel the 45 km (30 miles) between Syrias third and fourth largest pre-war cities.
Residents from Talbiseh, a town just north of Homs controlled by rebels until early May, said they were relieved to see the highway re-open.
If we wanted to go to Homs before, we had to go half way round the world, said 42-year-old farmer Hussein al-Muhammad. Now it will just take us quarter of a hour.
Another Talbiseh farmer, 61-year-old Hamoud Alloush, said he had survived the years of siege by eating what he could grow. He had already been to Homs and back to sell his produce on Wednesday.

Tense situ. at Maharagama UC
	
A tense situation arose during the Maharagama Urban Council session today, when many councillors opposed Kanthi Kodikara and five other SLPP members being sworn in as members of the council, replacing the members of the independent group, which contested under the symbol of bicycle.
Following the resignation of the six members, who contested under bicycle symbol at the LG Polls, the six SLPP members were sworn in by Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa this morning.
A UNP councilor of the Maharagama UC Wasantha Mathakorala was reportedly assaulted by several SLPP supporters, following the fracas that arose during the swearing in of the SLPP members to the UC.
According to sources, a member, attached to the independent group who supported the UNP, had been held in the Chairmans cabin.
Sources said that the opponents were still protesting within the council premises wearing black bands. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

## Title: The tragi-comedy of Sri Lankan politics

The tragi-comedy of Sri Lankan politics
	
It has been said that politics is the second oldest profession. I have learned that it bears a striking resemblance to the first- Ronald Reagan

In times of a national crisis the ideal is for all parties to sit down and talk. Though it was finally the war that brought an end to the protracted war here in Sri Lanka even the LTTE from time to time agreed to sit down with the Sri Lankan government. Call it premeditated still it did.
It is a fact that Sri Lanka is currently going through a period of gross instability. Theres indeed a crisis both economic and political. The panic-stricken average voter is left wondering how the leaders both government and the opposition can leave the country in the present state and continue to play petty political games. Daily a new episode or two is added to the unfolding political drama  the number game in parliament while the distraught voter hopes and prays for a miracle that would awaken the leaders to the pathetic state of affairs.
If our leaders love the country or are willing to put the country before self they should sit together and look for solutions. While the internal politics in the government has triggered the crisis theres no doubt the joint opposition is only making matters worse by instigating trade unions, university students and even medical doctors to take to streets or launch sudden strikes however much harm and harassment that may be caused to the citizens, especially the poor. Essential services are disrupted and traffic snarls created by protests and walks have only gone to make the already stressed up citizen more miserable. While the countrys growth is stunted and cost of living is skyrocketing people are being taxed left and right though they are not getting benefits in return. 
Meanwhile, neither the President nor the prime minister nor the joint opposition leader appears to be initiating a tripartite dialogue in the name of the hapless citizen to come out of this political quagmire. Instead the leaders continue with the blame game  some wailing day and night while others are busy going for the pound of flesh at every crisis. 
Tuesdays events in Parliament indicated that most people, including party leaders did not know who is on what side and for whom. The event was the election of the Deputy Speaker to replace Thilanga Sumathipala who has not only lost his post in Parliament but also was run out of Sri Lanka Cricket. The United National Party proposed Monaragala District Parliamentarian Ananda Kumarasiri while former minister S.B. Dissanayake proposed former state minister Sudarshani Fernandopulle. Both Mr. Dissanayake and Ms. Fernandopulle are supporters of President Maithripala Sirisena and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) but now they are sitting in the opposition. The secret ballots gave Mr. Kumarasiri a victory by 98 votes to 53 but no one is really sure who voted for whom while more than 70 MPs were not present at the time of voting with members of the joint opposition, the Tamil National Alliance and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna reported to have left Parliament when the vote was called. This is an indication of the chaos and crisscrossing loyalties. 
We hope that at least for the next 18 months the UNP and the pro-Sirisena SLFP group will work together to bring in more foreign investments and provide more jobs for the youth though Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweeras Gamperaliya may be limited to something like Lester James Peries dream film.

TNL hadn't paid licence fee so station closed: TRC
	
The TNL's Polgahawela transmission station was shut down because it had not paid the licence fee to use VHF CH 11 or VHF CH 3 frequencies, the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) said.
The TRC said Telshan Networks (Pvt) Ltd. (TNL) had obtained valid licences for nine such stations by paying the relevant fees for 2018.
The TNL has transmission licences for Colombo, Nuwara Eliya (Mt. Oliphant), Karagahatenna, Piliyandala, Awissawella, Badulla, Gongala, Hantana and Ratnapura. It has operated VHF CH 11 and CH 3 from time to time for a considerable period of time in contravention of Section 22 of Sri Lanka Telecommunication Act No. 25 of 1991 causing interference to other licensed Government broadcasters. The TRCSL informed TNL to shut down this illegal transmission on April 27, 2016. It had ignored our letter and continued transmissions causing interference to Government channels and without making due payment, causing loss to the Government, the TRC said.
It said action was taken against illegal broadcasting stations operated by different companies including Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation at Balangoda.
A television transmitter should be used at each of the above locations and a valid licence should be obtained under Section 22 of Sri Lanka Telecommunications Act No. 25 of 1991 as amended by Act No 27 of 1996. The licence issued will be valid for a period of one year and renewable for another year, on payment of relevant licence fee. Therefore, TRCSL had been compelled to take action against this violation based on above grounds and TRCSL emphasizes that there is no any other undue ambition behind this action, the TRC said.

Trump-Kim summit set for Singapores Sentosa Island
	

The summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will be on Singapores southern island of Sentosa, the White House said on Tuesday as preparations accelerated for next weeks event.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a Twitter post that the venue would be the Capella Hotel on Sentosa and thanked Singaporeans for their hospitality. The summit is scheduled to start on the morning of June 12. Trump told reporters at an Oval Office event that plans for what will be the first meeting between a serving U.S. president and a North Korean leader, were moving along very well.
A lot of relationships being built, a lot of negotiations going on before the trip, he said. Well see what happens. But its very important  itll be a very important couple of days. Trump, who is seeking to persuade Kim to shut down a nuclear missile programme that now threatens the United States, said on Friday the summit he had cancelled the previous week was back on after he received the North Korean delegation bearing a letter from Kim.
Trump said last week he expected an eventual very positive result with North Korea but dampened expectations for a breakthrough in Singapore, saying it could take several meetings to reach an agreement.

UN elects new General Assembly president
	

THE HINDU, 06th JUNE, 2018-Maria Fernanda Espinosa is the fourth woman elected to head the UN body.
Ecuadorean Foreign Minister Maria Fernanda Espinosa on Tuesday was elected president of the 73rd United Nations General Assembly, a mainly ceremonial title that nonetheless carries a high profile and important procedural functions.
Espinosa defeated Ambassador Mary Elizabeth Flores Flake of Honduras by 128 votes to 62, with two abstentions. Ms. Espinosa will become the fourth woman to hold the UNGA presidency and the first since Haya Rashed Al-Khalifa, from Bahrain, in 2006-07.
It was the first time that two women competed for the post.
Ms. Espinosa will assume the position in September at the start of the 73rd UN General Assembly, taking over from Slovakian Foreign Affairs Minister Miroslav Lajcak.
It is rare to have a contested election for the position, which is normally filled by consensus without a vote. It was the turn of Latin America and the Caribbean to nominate the Assembly president based on a preset geographical rotation.
Ms. Espinosa dedicated her victory to women in politics world wide, especially those who face gender discrimination.

Weinstein pleads not guilty to rape charges
	

REUTERS, 06th JUNE, 2018-Movie mogul Harvey Weinstein pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to charges of rape and sexual assault, his lawyer said, in the first cases involving the disgraced producer to be tested in criminal court since scores of accusers emerged last year.
More than 70 women have accused the Miramax film studios co-founder of sexual misconduct, including rape, in a series of incidents dating back decades. The accusations gave rise to the #MeToo movement, which has seen hundreds of women publicly accusing powerful men in business, government and entertainment of sexual harassment and abuse.
Weinstein, 66, left Manhattan Supreme Court without speaking to reporters. Defence attorney Benjamin Brafman and Justin Henry, a spokesman for the prosecutor, confirmed that Weinstein had pleadednot guilty.
Mr. Weinstein has denied these crimes. He has never engaged in non-consensual sex with anyone, Brafman told reporters. As terrible a crime as rape is, it is equally reprehensible to be falsely accused of rape. In his view, he has been falsely accusedof rape.
Weinstein turned himself in at a New York police station on May 25, and was taken to court in handcuffs for his initial arraignment. A judge ordered him released on a $1 million cash bail on condition that he surrender his U.S. passport and agree to wear a location-tracking device. He was ordered to remain in New York state or Connecticut.
Prosecutors from the Manhattan district attorneys office did not name the two women accusing Weinstein of sexual assault in the criminal complaint filed against him following a months-long investigation with the New York Police Department.

Yahapalanaya: Congenital flaws and their discontents
	
The burning political question of the day appears to be who and how many Parliamentarians received money from Perpetual Treasuries Ltd (PTL) for their respective election campaigns. In a political season marked by scandalous memory-loss some have claimed that they didnt always know who was depositing money in their accounts. Meanwhile, the full list of beneficiaries is proving to be elusive; first it was said that PTL had funded the campaigns of 116 politicians, later the number was upped to 166 and now it stands at 186. 
What is interesting, as Shamindra Ferdinando of The Island recently pointed out in a television discussion, is that no one is talking about the money that the Government of the United States of America has pumped into certain political campaigns here in Sri Lanka. The then US Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged that his Government had spent US$582 million to strengthen democracy in Sri Lanka, Burma and Nigeria. The Sri Lankan chunk was invested in the run up to the change-of-government in January 2015. The US Embassy in Colombo has not responded to a request by Ferdinando to reveal the amount relevant to Sri Lanka.
Now democracy is a good word and sounds decent too, but it has been prostituted so much and by no country as much as the USA, that its become a global joke whenever the USA is involved: Do as we say! says Uncle Sam, or else we will bring democracy to you! That could mean anything from drone attacks, a civil war, a devastated economy and misery lasting years. 
Its now a blame game about inefficiency, incompetence, wrongdoing and rank stupidity
What is relevant however is that even if those political friends of Uncle Sam got just 10% of this democracy-fund it is still about 7000 times more than what any of the politicians that PTL helped out during that election. PTL is under a cloud, sure, but then again the sky above Washington DC, metaphorically speaking, has been jet black for centuries. Sorry, thats being overly generous. Washington DC is not under a cloud, because that indicates the possibility of innocence. The point need not be elaborated. The question that Shamindra raises is pertinent: if these politicians erred in receiving bucks from PTL, what of the parties (and individuals) that were bucked by the State Department 
Given all this, maybe someone can argue that Russia, if that country got involved in the first place in the US Presidential Election, was only strengthening democracy since the giver can use the word regardless of intention and regardless of the color of the particular currency (robbed, plundered, swindled or printed). 
Lets get to the burning political question of the past three years: Yahapalanaya or lack thereof. What we are seeing almost on a daily basis is a scenario akin to thieves falling out. Its now a blame game about inefficiency, incompetence, wrongdoing and rank stupidity. The problem is that separate entities though they may believe themselves to be, while the Yahapalana knot stands, praise and blame accrue to all constituent elements of the coalition. 
The problem about taking pot shots at one another in this case is that the assailants happen to be twins, joined at their political hips. It is too late in the day to breakaway because any surgery will result in both being wounded and will leave both with a limp that will be a decisive handicap in any political race. 
Yes, we are talking about Maithripala Sirisena and Ranil Wickremesinghe. Yes, we are talking about the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and the United National Party. Yes, we are talking about the entire Yahapalana Government. Whether or not reduced circumstances and fear of sojourn in a political wilderness will force these twins to recognize the reality of their congenital fate we do not know. What we do know is that they are sorely lacking in political choices at this point. 
Things are so bad that quite contrary to Wickremesinghes message to the UNP, focus on solving the problems of the people all constituent parties of this government and their backers are betting on distractions. 
The issue of PTL funding politicians is a good example. The focus of a true yahapanalist (yes, the lot swearing by that term are patently fake) should be the issue of transparency and accountability in campaign finance. An individual yahapalanist politician, even at this late date, would say something like this: from this day forth I shall accept donations only on the condition that the name of the donor and the amount will be immediatelymade public. 
If any Yahapalanist was truly concerned about politicians being funded by a company that was accused of benefitting from as scandalous a scam as the one associated with Central Bank bonds, then such a person would also take issue with the interference in domestic affairs by the USA. But no, they never had issues with such things back in 2015. 
Therein lies the problem. Wrongdoing is not an issue. Wrongdoing by those who are not with them can be an issue whereas wrongdoing by someone in the family becomes a problem only when the integrity and political future of the clan could come under threat. 
Thats Yahapalanaya in a nutshell, folks; rather the UNP-SLFP version of it.
