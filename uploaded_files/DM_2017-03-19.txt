Chinese Defence Minister to visit Sri Lanka this week
	
Chinese Defence Minister Chang Wanquan will be in Sri Lanka and Nepal this week on an official visit, the Defence Ministry said and according to agency reports these visits are likely to unnerve neighbouring India.
China is vying to increase its influence in Nepal, which serves as a natural buffer between China and India, challenging India's long-held position as the dominant outside power in the landlocked nation.
China has also invested heavily in Sri Lanka, funding airports, roads, railways and ports, and including the island nation of 21 million people on its "One Belt, One Road" mission to create a modern-day "Silk Road" across Asia.
The ministry, in a short statement, said Deputy Naval Chief Su Zhiqian would accompany Minister Chang but it gave no other details.
China's Defence Ministry said in December that China would hold its first military drills with Nepal this year.
In 2014, Sri Lanka allowed a Chinese submarine and a warship to dock at its port in the capital Colombo, prompting concern in New Delhi.
India, which has a festering border dispute with China, has looked at the latter's strategic ambitions in South Asia and in the Indian Ocean with some nervousness.
China has close defence ties with India's long-time rival Pakistan, and has been getting closer to Bangladesh and the Maldives too.
Chinese warships now increasingly drill in the Indian Ocean as Beijing becomes more confident about projecting power far from its shores. (REUTERS)

Dual citizenship: Samarasinghe denies Geethas claims
	
Denying parliamentarian Geetha Kumarasinghes allegations made to the media that he was a dual citizenship holder, Skills Development Minister Samarasinghe said he did not hold dual citizenship either in Switzerland or in any other country except that of being a citizen of Sri Lanka.
Responding Mr. Samarasinghe said that she had made a false statement on previous occasions as well and during his age of 61 years he didnt have to obtain citizenship of other countries.
Issuing a press release the Minister said that any ordinary citizen had the right to become a citizen in any other country, however, cannot accept such a move by a public representative or a politician.
I have served for my country over 30-years. Though I have deserve or capable to hold a dual citizenship, as an honorable politician I didnt even imagine doing so. We are bound to protect our Constitution. A politician cannot accept any other countrys Constitution and could not pledge his loyalty to that country, he said.
However, he said that if Ms. Kumarasinghe continued to make such false statements against him and try to tarnish his image, he would resort to legal action. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Law not enforced: Police
	
Responding to several isolated incidents happening regarding the controversial full face helmets ban, Police Spokesman DIG Priyantha Jayakody said so far the law has not been enforced as there is a Supreme Court hearing regarding the issue.
He said so when Daily Mirror questioned on the information received that several police officers had threatened those who wear the full face helmets forcing them not to do so.
The court has given an interim order regarding the issue not to take action against the full face helmets. Therefore, though the gazette notification on the matter has been issued preventing the riders and the pillion riders wearing full face helmets, we could not put the law into force, he said.
DIG Jayakody said that there can be few isolated incidents happening, however all the police station had been advised on the situation and not to take action against full face helmets.
Further, he said if there are any cases regarding the matter, the victim could complain directly to Police Headquarters as the police do not have any authority to take action against the helmet wears until the court order.
Meanwhile, issuing a statement the Ceylon Motorcyclists Association has also noted that many incidents had been reported to their association throughout the country that police officers are threatening motorcyclists not to wear full face helmets. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

NGOs screen controversial Sri Lankan civil war documentary in Malaysia
	
Several NGOs in Malaysia co-organised a screening of a controversial documentary on the Sri Lankan civil war last night, ahead of the sentencing of Lena Hendry who was found guilty of screening the same four years ago.
However, the difference was that last nights screening was done via online streaming, and not with any other form of media, such as film reel, videotape or DVD.
A spokesman for one of the NGOs said the screening last night did not break any censorship laws in the country because it was streamed online.
The Film Censorship Act 2002 states that all films are illegal for distribution and possession unless approved by the Censorship Board.
But the law does not cover any content streamed online as there is no distribution or possession involved on the part of the viewer(s).
The screening of the 90-minute documentary was co-organised by Suaram, Lawyers for Liberty, Amnesty International-Malaysia, Aliran, and the Joint Action Group for Gender (JAG) equality.
Last month, Hendry was found guilty by the magistrates court in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia for screening No Fire Zone: The Killing Fields of Sri Lanka, a documentary highlighting the massacre of mostly ethnic Tamils by the Sri Lankan army, on July 3, 2013.
Hendry, who is a programme coordinator with rights group Pusat Komas, was arrested when the home ministry conducted a raid at the venue where the film screening took place.
She faces sentencing on March 22 and could face up to three years in prison or a maximum fine of RM50,000, or both.
Hendry was acquitted by the same Magistrates Court in March last year. However, the High Court overturned the acquittal and ordered her to enter her defence on her charge under Section 6(1)(b) of the Film Censorship Act.
Hendry said that the government should emulate developed countries by putting an end to censorship.
We have to move on from censorship to ratings. A lot of countries have moved on. Malaysia actually has one of the most repressive censorship laws.
Give people a choice to choose whether the movie is too violent for them and rate movies according to age. Only then can we move forward, she said.
She also expressed her gratitude towards the outpouring of support from other NGOs and the general public.
I really appreciate all the support I got so far. Usually, when an activist gets arrested, its the civil societies that organise candlelight vigils.
But I also received a lot of support from the public and different people like academics and filmmakers.
The documentary, directed by Callum Macrae, shows footage from the carnage that took place in the last months of the Sri Lankan civil war that was drawn out over 26 years.
It depicts terrifying moments of heavy shelling which targeted densely populated areas, gory scenes of mutilated bodies, and accounts of rape and killing.
The civil war broke out in 1983 until the Sri Lankan military defeated the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (Tamil Tigers) in 2009. It saw over 100,000 civilians killed.
Both factions were accused of human rights violations, with instances of starvation, torture, recruitment of child soldiers and civilian-targeted attacks, including suicide bombing, being rampant.
The UN Human Rights Commission had last year urged the Sri Lankan government to investigate disappearances, including those of people who were alleged to have been secretly abducted by state-backed groups.(FreeMalaysiaToday)

Rock and roll legend Chuck Berry dies
	
Rock and roll legend Chuck Berry has died aged 90, police in the US state of Missouri report.
The singer was found unresponsive at lunchtime on Saturday, St Charles County police said.
Berry's seven-decade career boasted a string of hits, including classics Roll Over Beethoven and Johnny B. Goode.
He received a lifetime achievement Grammy in 1984 and was among the first inductees to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986.
In a statement on Facebook, the St Charles County Police Department said they were called to reports of an unresponsive man at 12:40 local time (17:40 GMT).
"Unfortunately, the 90-year-old man could not be revived and was pronounced deceased at 1:26pm," the statement continued.
"The St. Charles County Police Department sadly confirms the death of Charles Edward Anderson Berry Sr., better known as legendary musician Chuck Berry."
High-profile musicians were quick to pay tribute to Berry's talent and influence.
Motown legends The Jacksons tweeted: "Chuck Berry merged blues & swing into the phenomenon of early rock'n'roll. In music, he cast one of the longest shadows. Thank You Chuck."
Singer-songwriter Huey Lewis described him as "maybe the most important figure in all of rock and roll".
"His music and influence will last forever," he added.
Beatles drummer Ringo Starr quoted one of Berry's own lyrics on Twitter, saying: "Just let me hear some of that rock 'n' roll music any old way you use it."
"I am playing I'm talking about you," he wrote
Both the Beatles and the Rolling Stones covered Berry's songs, as did The Beach Boys and scores of other acts - including Elvis.
"If you tried to give rock 'n' roll another name," John Lennon once said, "you might call it 'Chuck Berry'."
Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones said that Berry "lit up our teenage years and blew life into our dreams".
Singer Bruce Springsteen called him "a giant for the ages"
The novelist Stephen King noted that Berry had a long life for a consummate rock'n'roller, tweeting: "Chuck Berry died. This breaks my heart, but 90 years old ain't bad for rock and roll. Johnny B. Goode forever."
Berry was born in St Louis, Missouri, in 1926, and had his first hit, Maybellene, in 1955.
Last year, he announced he would be releasing his first album in nearly four decades. He dedicated it to his wife of 68 years, Themetta "Toddy".(BBC)

Addressing the protesters, Vaiko said the United States would bring a resolution giving two more years for Sri Lanka to hold an inquiry into the war crimes and the resolution also says that no international jurists could enter the island nation without the latters consent.
The new resolution will bury justice for Tamils at the United Nations since a resolution asking Lanka to carry out an international, independent investigation was passed in the UNHRC in 2015, MDMK general secretary Vaiko said.(Deccan Chronicle)
