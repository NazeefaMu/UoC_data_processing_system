Abandoned lands in WPC to be taxed
	
Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya has directed the authorities to charge a two per cent tax on the total value of the lands remaining abandoned in Western Province in keeping with the laws pertaining to such matters.
He told Daily Mirror that the owners of such land would be liable for this tax with effect from yesterday. He said these abandoned lands had become thriving dengue mosquito breeding sites.
This tax is already outlined in the laws governing local bodies. It is not something that only the Western Province can implement, every provincial council can do so, the CM said.
He said a large number of dengue breeding sites had been detected on abandoned lands as they were hardly maintained by its owners.
As of today officials will survey abandoned lands to gauge the current market value after which two percent of the value would be imposed as tax.
The tax may may not be a one time payment, the CM said and added that the authorities also had the power to acquire the land if the tax was not paid.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

America has a distorted vision of the world: Pope
	

Vatican, (Daily Mail), 8 July 2017 - Pope Francis warned world leaders at the G20 summit against forming dangerous alliances that could harm migrants and the poor.

He also called Europe the richest continent in the whole world and urged it not to close off its borders.In May, in the presence of top EU leaders like German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Brexit may never happen, says top Liberal Democrat Cable
	
REUTERS, 09th JULY, 2017-Britains scheduled exit from the European Union may never happen because its main political parties are too divided on the issue, said Vince Cable, a veteran lawmaker bidding to lead the fourth largest political party, the Liberal Democrats.

Prime Minister Theresa Mays failure to win an outright majority in a snap national election last month has cast doubt on her capacity to lead Britain out of the EU, sharpening a debate on what sort of exit deal the government should seek.   Im beginning to think that Brexit may never happen, Cable told the BBC on Sunday. The problems are so enormous, the divisions within the two major parties are so enormous I can see a scenario in which this doesnt happen.
Cable served as business minister between 2010 and 2015 when the pro-European Liberal Democrats were the junior partners in a coalition government led by Mays Conservative Party.
He is currently the only candidate in a contest for leadership of his party.

Disputed Kashmir has seen an explosion of protests against Indian rule since government forces shot and killed Burhan Wani, a charismatic 23-year-old who had built up a big following on social media a year ago.

Speaking to reporters after the two-day Group of 20 summit in Germany ended, Putin said he and Trump had a long discussion about the allegations of Russian interference in last years election that have dogged Trumps presidency. 
The Russian leader said he reiterated his well-known position that there are no grounds for the allegations.He asked many questions, I tried to answer them all, Putin said. It seems to me that he has taken note of that and agreed, but its better to ask him about his attitude.

Sri Lanka Insurance posts record profits for 2016
	

Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (SLI) has recorded the largest Life Fund in the local insurance industry to-date with a ground-breaking Life Insurance Fund provision of Rs. 91.1 billion.
The General Insurance Fund, meanwhile, increased to Rs. 16.5 billion from Rs. 14.9 billion in 2015, a growth of 10.7 per cent. This was disclosed at a media conference held on July 5, at the companys head office in Colombo to announce the financial performance of SLI for the year 2016.
SLI, the pioneer as well as the leading national insurance company, recorded an outstanding performance during 2016 with total revenue recording a whopping Rs. 42 billion from Rs. 31 billion of the previous year.
Profit before taxation reached Rs. 13.8 billion from Rs. 4.8 billion in 2015, a growth of 186 percent, while Profit after Taxation grew toRs. 12.7 billion from Rs. 3.4 billion over the same period. The net profit growth is 270 percent.
The assets base also grew significantly to Rs. 176.8 billion in 2016 from Rs. 166.9 billion in 2015, pointing to a Return on Assets of 7 percent. The asset base is also the largest in the insurance industry.
The Gross Written Premium of SLI grew 13 percent to Rs. 28 billion from Rs. 24.5 billion. The Net Earned Premium grew to Rs. 24 billion from Rs. 20 billion over the corresponding period.
Over the past years, SLI has been declaring increasing bonuses to its Life policyholders, establishing itself as the Sri Lankan insurer to have paid the largest bonus in the history of the industry. The year 2016 was no different with a life bonus of Rs. 6.2 billion being announced for policyholders.
A dividend of Rs. 10.8 billion was paid by SLI to the government during the year under review. These achievements are especially noteworthy in a year which saw relatively slow market growth with a slightly less active economy.
Being backed by top international reinsurers such as Swiss Re and Munich Re has continued to safeguard SLIs position. Even when faced with a sharp increase in claims due to the floods of 2016, with claims worth Rs. 600 million being paid on natural disasters alone, its financial situation remained solid.  
Chairman SLI, Hemaka Amarasuriya, while describing these achievements as remarkable considering the challenging environment, said there are more opportunities for SLI to grow in the future. Our focus during the next three years will be on strategic intervention to realise most of this potential and drive growth rates to greater heights aimed at bettering the market rates of the past, he said.
He said: We have commenced the outline for a new three-year business strategy from 2018 to 2020 including plans for rapid branch expansion. We continue to develop new, speclialised insurance products for specific target groups. We believe that controlled branch expansion will be the key to achieving a faster rate of growth within the next three years.
The company also plans to expand the insurance scheme for migrant workers, introduced in 2016 for Sri Lankans employed in Kuwait, to other countries in the Middle East. The pilot scheme was introduced in partnership with Gulf Insurance and Reinsurance Company to provide cover for migrant workers in case of accidents, death, disability, legal costs and repatriation.
Specialised insurance packages for the farming community, teachers and schoolchildren are also in the offing while an inbound tourist insurance policy is also being developed to ensure that visitors to the country are insured against death, disability and
health emergencies.

Stormy G20 ends
	

World leaders made concessions on trade and climate language to Donald Trump Saturday at the end of the most fractious and riot-hit G20 summit ever, in exchange for preserving a fragile unity of the club of major industrialised and emerging economies. 
In a departure from final summit declarations that tend to outline consensus on issues that range from fighting terrorism to financial governance, the extraordinary conclusion this year spelt out differences on core issues. 
It acknowledged Trumps decision to take the United States out of the 2015 Paris deal and clearly stated Washingtons wish to continue using and selling fossil fuels that are a main driver of global warming. 
And in one of the weekends more bizarre scenes, Trump raised eyebrows by leaving a discussion and letting his daughter Ivanka take his place. 
But the gesture opened the door for others, with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warning that Ankara was now leaning towards not ratifying the landmark Paris climate accord. 
Where there is no consensus, the communique spelt out the discord, said host Chancellor Angela Merkel.
The declaration also stated for the first time the right of countries to protect their markets with legitimate trade defence instruments -- wording that essentially gives Trump wiggle room to push on with his America First policy. 
The nationalistic stance has set him on collision course with many of Americas allies, who warned Trump against an isolationist path and starting a trade war.

Tuk Tuks  in Trouble Delving into the issue within
	

The friendly neighbourhood Tuk-Tuk found itself in a spot of trouble last week, when the United States Embassy issued a travel advisory to US Citizens travelling in Sri Lanka warning them against errant trishaw drivers. It advised US citizens maintain situational awareness of increasing incidents involving trishaw drivers, especially in Colombo, inappropriately touching female passengers. In a security message posted in their website, the embassy published a guideline for female US citizens to adhere to when visiting Colombo, such as avoid travelling in trishaws alone in Colombo- If you have to travel alone (especially at night) use a company that tracks your ride rather than trishaws and make sure family members or friends know your travel plans, the statement said. Many of the reported incidents occurred at the end of a ride, the embassy stated, encouraging travellers to use registered companies providing trishaw taxi services. Travellers opting to use tuk-tuks were requested to note the registration plate before boarding and also to snap a photo of the driver. In an island where public transportation is a burdensome affair, tuk-tuks are the preferred choice of travel for many who opt to travel safe and free. Stepping out into rush hour traffic, one could see dozens of women hailing trishaws to get home in the evening hours, regardless of advisories issued. The travel advisory issued by the US embassy ruffled a few feathers, with many questioning the safety of women travelling alone in trishaws. The Daily Mirror spoke to several representatives concerned with the issue, to elaborate on the matter. 


Conspiracy to disrupt local trishaw services
All Island Three Wheel Owners Association, Sudhil Jayaruk

Speaking on the advisory issued by the US embassy Chairman of the All Island Three Wheel Owners Association, Sudhil Jayaruk said that the Association cannot accept such statements. We have been in service of hundreds of passengers for decades. There have rarely been any reports of women being harassed by trishaw drivers in the country and local officials have never made any statements as such. Therefore we question the grounds on which this statement was made, Jayaruck said. 
Foreign women who visit our country are respectable women. But there are also women who misbehave and expect the driver to encourage their behaviour. A foreign woman being harassed in a trishaw is unheard of. But the tourism industry on the other hand is plagued with misdeeds and we have heard of countless reports where foreigners have been harassed or even murdered. Why are trishaw drivers being targeted he questioned. 
In my experience as a three wheel driver, I have met foreign women who expect the driver to engage and encourage in various illicit activities. If the driver is coerced by the passenger, it cannot be the fault of the driver. Jayaruck added however that it was the responsibility of the driver to act in a responsible manner faced with such a situation where the passenger makes unethical demands. 
Sudhil Jayaruck states that the US Embassy has made this statement on baseless allegations. If there were such reports, there is a tourist police in every major city, where the officers have acted in unbiased and fair way. The police have assisted countless foreigners who were in need and resolved their issues promptly. 
Therefore we need evidence and an account of the incidents where they claim that women have been harassed by three wheeler drivers, or else they should rectify or withdraw their statement he said. 
Jayaruck is of the belief that an external force is at play in a masterful plan to disrupt the local trishaw services. 


"A foreign woman being harassed in a trishaw is unheard of. When such statements are made, the message is spread around the world, and it is a disgrace"

When such statements are made, the message is spread around the world, and it is a disgrace. Other countries pay attention and take similar precautions. We admit that there are drug peddlers, pimps and criminals who also drive three wheelers to aid their activities. However I view this statement as an attempt to disrupt trishaw services in the island. This is an incident where the embassy has made the allegations or complaints public. There are powerful countries which have deployed their taxi services in Sri Lanka. This is an act of the taxi mafia. It is not unheard of and there have been similar reports from other countries where these international taxi operators were engaged in similar conspiracies. 
In his comments Jayaruck also stressed on the need for government intervention. 
This is precisely why we have demanded for regulations to be implemented. We have sought the intervention of the Minister of Transport to discuss this issue with the US embassy. They should realise that there are close to 800,000 trishaw drivers in the island and any attempt to disrupt their income would result in grave consequences, 
Jayaruck warned, adding that the association would resort to trade union action if a favourable solution is not agreed upon. 


Regulatory mechanism being formulated
National Council for Road Safety (NCRS)
Chairman Dr.Sisira Kodagoda

The Daily Mirror also approached the National Council for Road Safety (NCRS) Chairman Dr. Sisira Kodagoda, to query his stance on the issue. 
As soon as the issue was brought to my attention, I sought an audience with several representatives of the trishaw drivers unions. We discussed their concerns. I have to admit that there are shortcomings in local trishaw drivers. Several incidents have been reported especially during evenings that were brought to our attention. All passengers will not agree with demands of a trishaw driver and disputes can take place. However, we have requested for more information from the US embassy, providing a detailed account of such instances, Dr. Kodagoda said. 
The US embassy has a responsibility to inform the Foreign Affairs Ministry, or the Transport Ministry if such issues were brought to their notice. As far as I know, they have not reported to either of the ministries and have directly issued this message to the media. In this instance, the US embassy has taken responsibility to warn their own citizens, Dr. Kodagoda elaborated. 
The NCRS Chairman insisted that there is a pertinent need to address these issues.  We have requested information from the embassy reasoning the statement to rectify these problems. There are drivers who engage in the taxi service as a part time activity. A system is being formulated to address this issue to identify part time drivers. I will submit a letter to the embassy secretary, requesting more information and reasoning to rectify the issue. We have to assure the safety of all passengers of the country, regardless of their gender or nationality, he said.

"The US embassy has a responsibility to inform the Foreign Affairs Ministry, or the Transport Ministry if such issues were brought to their notice. As far as I know, they have not reported to either of the ministries and have directly issued this message to the media. In this instance, the US embassy has taken responsibility to warn their own citizens"

It is evident from comments we gathered that issue does not lie in the quality of trishaw drivers, but the absence of a mechanism to monitor and regulate trishaw drivers. In the 2017 budget speech delivered by the then Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake, it was noted there was approximately 1.3 million three wheelers operating on our roads. The vacuum in the regulatory mechanism has resulted in the industry growing haphazardly he added. Despite his proposal to introduce a regulatory mechanism and the issuing of a gazette with new rules to come into effect by April, we see no positive change on the streets. It is unfortunate that authorities are reminded of the requisite regulation of this trusted and reliable mode of transport, only when a blanket warning is issued by a foreign embassy. 


A problem of the authorities own making
All Island Three wheeler Drivers Union, Lalith Dharmasekara

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, the All Island Three wheeler Drivers Union President Lalith Dharmasekara said that he will not give any validity to the US statement. 
We have dealt with such issues since 1999. Our association has brought countless proposals not only to the Western Provincial Council but the consecutive governments and ministers of transport, to regulate the trishaw drivers profession. 
There have been various recommendations, gazette notifications and committees and advisory panels established since then, promising to champion the rights of the trishaw driver. Decades have lapsed and we still have no framework to regulate the industry, Dharmasekara lamented. 
In 2009, when Nandana Gunathilake was the Tourism Minister, the tourist friendly tuk-tuk concept was launched. Trishaws drivers were identified and trained. They had to complete a course where they were taught English. They were given hospitality service training and their trishaws were branded as a tourist friendly tuk-tuk. 
We were identified as a vital part of the hospitality industry and were a part of such programmes. But all our efforts, time and motivation have been wasted and it was yet another abandoned project Dharmasekara said. 

"In 2009, when Nandana Gunathilake was the Tourism Minister, the tourist friendly tuk-tuk concept was launched. Trishaws drivers were identified and trained. They had to complete a course where they were taught English. They were given hospitality service training and their trishaws were branded as a tourist friendly tuk-tuk"

The President of the union charged that the present government was no different as they have not implemented any of their promised changes. All top officials have been boasting that they would bring about change, the very next day. Gazettes were printed at the beginning of this year stating that regulations would come into effect by April. Six months have lapsed and nothing has happened, 
Whatever regulation there is, it has been created by us. We introduced metrers as a self-regulatory measure. The Consumer Affairs Authority admits that they have no power to address the grievances of the commuter. This is why I cant accept charges of harassment. Such negative publicity is not healthy and this would result in detrimental consequences. We have made our stance clear and demanded for regulatory authorities to every tourism minister during the last two decades. Trishaws were a promotional tool the government intended to use in the tourism industry. Today, trishaws have become the very reason causing negative attention to the islands tourism industry. It is high time that the government realised the importance of regulations and take our demands seriously. The advisory issued by the US embassy is a result of complete ignorance by authorities and we cannot be held responsible for this, Dharmasekara opined. 
The Daily Mirror also found several messages posted on the popular travel website tripadvisor on the forum of safety and travel in tuk-tuks. Among the many positive experiences of travellers using tuk-tuks for their journeys, the concerns raised were mostly about foreign travellers being fleeced by drivers. The website also had a post about travelling in Sri Lanka in trishaws with a special guide for women. Other popular travel websites such as Lonely Planet also had forums for discussion on the same topic, where travellers felt that scams were a more severe problem than their safety. Several attempts to contact officials at the Ministry of Tourism, to query their stance on the issue, failed.

Using feminine charm for fence-mending
	
A rumour abuzz in political says that a charming young ladylove of a prominent purohita had in a surprise move invited a onetime political heavyweight to tea at her residence which the latter had politely declined.
A loyal political supporter had hosted the former political leader to lunch when he (the latter) arrived for a public function held in the area. The fair and lovely one dressed in a colourful saree had arrived at the residence of the political supporter uninvited and mingled with the guests for some time before getting the opportunity to speak to the former leader. Sir, I am inviting you to tea at my place this evening. I hope you will find time to do me this honour, she had said in the most coquettish manner she could assume.
However, the political leader had politely declined the invitation saying, I am sorry. The time factor does not allow me the pleasure. Dont worry. Theres always another day.
Later a guest had told the former political leader in an undertone: Theres no doubt that she has come here purposefully. Her boyfriend may have thought of doing a somersault back to our side!
The seasoned political leader had nodded his agreement. I know It. She has come here on an errand!
