After the motion we can clearly see the way forward
	
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) Leader Udaya Gammanpila in an interview with the Daily Mirror spoke about the no confidence motion and the plans to win it.
Excerpts: 

We believe TNA will abstain from vote of no confidence
	Its up to President to decide onnext PM
	Were confident of getting the required majority to win the motion
	Anyone is better than thepresent PM
	We have 95 of the UPFA members
Q How confident are you of mustering enough numbers to win the no confidence motion against the Prime Minister
Of course, yes. As you know, three Prime Ministers tendered their resignations in the world for different reasons. On February 15, 2018, Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn tendered his resignation due to his failure in curbing the anti-government protests that were escalating. On March 15, 2018, Slovenian Prime Minister Miro Cerar resigned over a defeat at a referendum. On the very same day, the Prime Minister of Slovakia Robert Fico resigned because an investigative journalist and his girlfriend were killed. The Government failed to trace the murderer. On February 14, South African President Jacob Zuma resigned following a mere handing over of a no confidence motion against him. In the United Kingdom, Prime Minister David Cameron tendered his resignation on June 24 (2016) because 52 percent of the voters held a view opposite to his with regard to BREXIT. 
In the case of Sri Lankan Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe, he has miserably failed in economic management and maintaining law and order. He is facing the biggest corruption allegation over the alleged Bond Scam. In the case of David Cameron, he resigned because 52 percent of the people voted against his position. At the last elections, the UNP was able to obtain only 29 percent of the votes. It means 71 percent of the people have rejected the Premier. Yet, he didnt respect the time-honoured tradition of resigning at this juncture. Therefore, we were reluctantly compelled to bring the no confidence motion. There are major allegations against him in the motion. First, there is the alleged Bond Scam. It covers 11 allegations. Then there is the allegation regarding the failure to prevent the economic collapse. Thirdly, his failure to maintain law and order in Kandy during the unrest is there. Fourthly, he has violated nine Acts of Parliament. 
The TNA saw its vote base drop by 50 percent at the recent Local Government Elections
Q How do you muster enough numbers to win this
We have 95 of the UPFA members. 
Q Are you certain that all of them will vote in favour of the motion
Out of the 95, five SLFPers have expressed their reluctance. However, the SLFP seniors are confident that four out of five could be convinced. We do admit that there is one individual standing strongly against the motion. 
Q Can you name him
I dont want to. I am trying to win him over. I dont want to sabotage that process by naming him. We have 94 without him. Then, we have EPDP Leader MP Douglas Devananda. It means 95 for us. We have a logical, fact-based assessment. Our assessment is that the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) will abstain from supporting the motion. They have a genuine problem. For the Southerners, the UNP means the Government. For the northerners, the TNA means the Government. The TNA has unconditionally supported and protected this Government during the past three years. The TNA saw its vote base drop by 50 percent at the recent Local Government Elections. As a result, the TNA doesnt want to identify itself with the Government anymore. 
JVP has been critical of the Government regarding these charges in recent times. Then, we have 101. We need only four more members from the UNP to secure the victory.
Q Have you communicated with the TNA before coming to such a conclusion
As I told you, I dont want a single word of mine to sabotage the process. I am not going to explain in detail why I say so. We expect the TNA to abstain. They have openly criticized the Central Bank issue. They have been critical of the downside of the economy. They are critical of the Government over the attacks in Kandy. If 16 MPs of the TNA abstain, the number will come down to 209. The majority is 105 then. We have 95. The JVP will have to vote in favour. The JVP has been critical of the Government regarding these charges in recent times. Then, we have 101. We need only four more members from the UNP to secure the victory. There are 20 members to support instead of four. 
Q Are you planning to obtain the support of Muslim members over the allegation regarding the Kandy incidents
They have openly criticized the Governments failure in Kandy. In fact, one Muslim MP said there are 21 Muslim parliamentarians in the Government. He said it was a shame for them to be with the Government. 
Whatever is the outcome after the vote, we will emerge as the winners eventually. 
Q Why do you say so
As you know, if we win, the curse of the Prime Minister will be no more. If we fail, we can expose the SLFPers who criticized the Prime Minister in the run-up to the Local Government Elections. The SLFP, not us, was critical of the UNP at the elections. If any of the SLFPers does not vote for the motion, he will be exposed as not being genuine.

We have carefully drafted the motion without any malice, so that everybody can be accommodated. 
If the JVP isnt going to support the motion, they will be exposed. People will genuinely believe that there is a deal between the Prime Minister and JVP Leader Anura Kumara. Thirdly, the UNPers have been fed-up with the Prime Minister during the past 24 years. They yearn for a new UNP Leader. 
Q If you dont succeed at this motion, what is the next alternative
We have a genuine problem after the Local Government Elections. The Prime Minister was planning to become the next Presidential Candidate of the UNP in the hope that he would win for sure. He had such confidence because he managed to defeat Mahinda Rajapaksa at the last Parliamentary Elections. However, after the local polls, the Prime Minister has been able to foresee the results of the upcoming presidential elections19 months in advance. Now, he has given up on contesting the Presidential Elections. When he was planning to contest the Presidential Elections, he feared the public opinion which was building up against him. Therefore, he delayed the agreements such as the ETCA. That is why he soft-pedalled on the Federal constitution. He took a slow approach in the alienation of national assets to foreigners. Now, he has given up on his plan to be the presidential candidate. So, he is insensitive to public opinion. That is why the Office of Missing Persons is in operation. He took steps to enact the Enforced Disappearances Bill. 
Now, he wants to avenge the people for electorally rejecting him. His premiership has been a disaster for the country. Any nationalist, irrespective of his party line, should join hands with us. 
After getting rid of him, anybody will be better than Wickremesinghe. 
Out of the 95, five SLFPers have expressed their reluctance. However, the SLFP seniors are confident that four out of five could be convinced. We do admit that there is one individual standing strongly against the motion
Q Who should be the next Prime Minister in your view
It is none of our business. That is vested with the President. Whoever he thinks fit enough for this position can be appointed. The President can only assess who commands confidence in Parliament.
Q There is talk that someone from the UNP would be picked for the post again. Also, it is said that somebody from the SLFP would become the Premier. What is your view
I have my personal preferences. It is not material at all. What is material is the Presidents confidence and preferences. Let him do his job! 
Q What is the position of the Joint Opposition in this regard
As we have repeatedly said, we sought a mandate at the last parliamentary and Local Government Elections to make Mahinda Rajapaksa the Prime Minister. We have no mandate to accept portfolios from the next Government without making him the Prime Minister. We cannot make this proposal to the President and make him comfortable. 
If the JVP isnt going to support the motion, they will be exposed. People will genuinely believe that there is a deal between the Prime Minister and JVP Leader Anura Kumara
Q You said anyone other than the present Prime Minister is better. Does it mean that you support even another UNPer to be the Prime Minister
I am going to see the pros and cons of each person because I have no authority to name the next Prime Minister. 
Q Do you see any understanding between the former President and the present President
There are no permanent friends or enemies in politics. Four years ago, they were thick pals. But, the political circumstances pushed them apart. And, the political circumstances bring them closer. I am not a soothsayer to predict the future. But, anything is possible. 
Many people think that the Joint Opposition want to get rid of the Prime Minister. It is the President who wanted it. He urged the Prime Minister to step down for another UNPer to succeed. Were trying to meet the aspirations of the President. It is the foundation for cordial relations between the President and the former President. 
Q Would this unity take place
It is a crucial juncture. We are at a crossroads. After the motion, we can clearly see the way forward for Sri Lanka. Lets wait patiently!

Charges fild  to extradite ex-Catalan leader
	

BERLIN REUTERS April 3-German prosecutors filed a request to a regional court on Tuesday for the extradition of former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont to Spain, where he faces charges of rebellion over the regions campaign for independence. 
Puigdemont has been held in a detention centre in the northern German town of Neumuenster for just over a week after he was arrested in Germany on March 25. 
Prosecutors in the state of Schleswig-Holstein said Spains extradition request was admissible because accusations of rebellion included carrying out an anti-constitutional referendum even though violent clashes could be expected. 
This has a comparable equivalent in German law, said the prosecutors in a statement. 
Prosecutors also asked the Higher Regional Court in Schleswig-Holstein, which will decide on the extradition, to keep Puigdemont in prison during the proceedings because there was a danger he would try to escape. 
Puigdemont fled Spain five months ago for Belgium after Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy dismissed his regional administration.

Former President and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa said the defeat of the No-Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is also a victory.
Speaking to journalists outside theParliament Chamber, Mr. Rajapaksa said the result would have been changed if all SLFP MPs voted in favour of the motion.
"First we had only 54 votes. However, this was increased to 76 during the vote," he said.

## Title: Failed impeachments and conspiracies against UNP

## Date: 4 April 2018 12:52 am
Failed impeachments and conspiracies against UNP
	
Jean Paul Satre stated, Politics is a science. You can demonstrate that you are right and others are wrong. 
If they defeat the NCM today; the Ranil faction will consolidate their position within the party
	Considering the inter-party cross-over scenarios, it is always the UNP, that was the winner
	If the NCM gets the required number of over 113 votes the President would appoint a senior UNPer as PM
Brain power and cunningness exhibited by UNP leadership in capturing power or remaining in power, when compared to their counterparts in the other main parties, is far superior. They are clever in manipulating and scheming. They have also enjoyed the privilege of being businessmen financiers who would volunteer to meet any financial gratifications that need to be paid to potential political converts in the process. They have been well-known for effectively scheming to defeat an existing regime. The best examples are the 1964 toppling of Sirimavos Government which attempted to muzzle the press in taking over the Lake House, by soliciting the help of her number two, CP de Silva; then, Daughter Chandrikas in 2001, where they used four of her senior ministers and lastly the Rajapaksa family regime in 2015 with the help of SLFP General Secretary and a few other stalwarts.
Political acumen is vital in running a country under democratic set-up. The skill and shrewdness are extremely important attributes, which, unfortunately, the SLFPers, with the exception of Rajapaksas, badly lacked
Leaders like D.S, J.R, Premadasa and Ranil could be ranked as the top shining models that fit the above description that post-independent Sri Lanka had produced. Considering the inter-party cross-over scenarios, it is always the UNP, that was the winner, while the SLFP led coalitions became the loser. It is surprising that it never happened the other way around, meaning a conspiracy by the SLFP on UNP. Also, something common to all local political parties is the competitive cutthroat acts within the same party. Political acumen is vital in running a country under democratic set-up. The skill and shrewdness are extremely important attributes, which, unfortunately, the SLFPers, with the exception of Rajapaksas, badly lacked. Jean Paul Satre said so; a reader comments in this newspaper a couple of days before, responding to Ranil loyalist Ajith Perera- Hi Tomy The entire outfit is a joke..STEP DOWN !!
If they defeat the NCM today; the Ranil faction will consolidate their position within the party. Reforms will never see the light of the day. Rajapaksas can celebrate a victory after losing their motion. If the NCM gets the required number of votes, over 113 (presence of a full house is anticipated) the President would act graciously by appointing a senior UNPer as PM, and not an SLFP man and close the chapter without upsetting the apple cart, but causing a major split in the UNP, on the lines of Ranil (R-L) loyalists versus the rest; adding more woes to the Yahapalana Government. Here again in reality, the Rajapaksas will claim a victory. 
Keselwatta-Kurunduwatta Power Struggle.
Israel and the US were not happy about President Premadasas decision to close units of Israels Interests in the US embassy in Sri Lanka. He antagonized the British Foreign office by naming their envoy here as persona non-grata and ordered the expulsion of High Commissioner David Gladstone over a trivial matter. Lalith Athulathmudali, the senior UNPer who served as National Security Minister in President Jayawardenes Cabinet had spoken of fear for his life at the hands of goon squads formed to terrorise Premadasas opponents. Vigilante squads drawn from the JSS, that the UNPs trade union had been organising in Government Corporations. These squads functioned as para-military units and did not hesitate to act violently to achieve their ends.
On 24th September 1991 the Parliament met to discuss the impeachment motion against President Premadasa. His attempt to address the house was met with continued booing and shouting by the opposition
J.R, who was toying with the idea of another amendment to make way for a third term in 1988, listened to intelligence at a time the whole country was in turmoilLTTE in North and JVP in South were creating mayhem. He gave up the idea. Between R Premadasa, Gamini Dissanayake and Lalith Athulathmudali, the three contenders, following a secret vote, decided to field Premadasa. Lalith backed Premadasa to the hilt at 1988 Presidential stakes, while Gamini had other ideas; an opportunity to dump both Premadasa and Athulathmudali as the JVP hanumans was setting the nation in flames. Jansaviya aided by Sirimavos last moment pact with Kumar Ponnambalam brought an unexpected victory to Premadasa. 
Let down by the suspicious boss when he appointed weak D.B Wijetunge as PM, Athulathmudali revived his relations with Gamini who was left out of the cabinet at the reshuffle in 1991. Few other anti Premadasa seniors joined the conspiracy to oust the boss in an impeachment. On 24th September 1991 the Parliament met to discuss the impeachment motion against President Premadasa. His attempt to address the house was met with continued booing and shouting by the opposition, and the sittings had to be adjourned.
Let down by the suspicious boss when he appointed weak D.B Wijetunge as PM, Athulathmudali revived his relations with Gamini
Premaratne Gunasekera, a fairly senior member of the party was not in the good books of Premadasa, and had to remain a back-bencher once said,  this man should be sent home, so I signed the impeachment. A famous Mudalali (from timber to healthcare) offered me a packet of notes and appealed for withdrawal of the signature. Speaker MH Mohomed who secretly backed the GAGers (Gamini-Athulathmudali-Gang: name coined by the then state print media) made a 180 degrees turn and announced that the required number of signatures is not there. The rest is history; and they sayhistory repeats itself.

French rail workers begin months of strike in test for Macron
	

REUTERS, 03rd APRIL, 2018- French railway services were thrown into chaos on Tuesday, the first day of rolling nationwide strikes that are set to run for months in the toughest test yet of President Emmanuel Macrons determination to modernize the French economy.
Just one in four trains were running in the Paris region, national rail company SNCF said, as people made their way back to work after an extended Easter holiday weekend on what French media dubbed Black Tuesday.
Platforms at Gare du Nord, Pariss busiest railway station, were so crowded with commuters that some tumbled onto the tracks and had to be helped back up, television footage showed.
I do understand why theyre striking, said Marie Charles, a Paris commuter. But today is my first day in a new job so I have to admit I could have done without the strike.
The four main rail unions plan to strike for two days out of every five for the next three months  a total of 36 days of disruption  to fight a shake-up of the SNCF before its monopoly is ended in line with European Union rules.
The last French president to square off against rail unions over workers benefits came off worst.

How the tit-for-tat bid came a cropper
	

A Green party member had taken the initiative to collect signatures of Diyawanna members of all parties for a motion expressing confidence in the Green leader.

After collecting a good number of signatures from Greens and other party Diyawanna members, the member had planned to collect signatures of at least four Blue party members. This had been meant as a paying back with the same coin response to four Blue party members signing the JO-mooted no confidence motion.
In fact, four Blue members had earlier indicated their willingness to sign the motion expressing confidence in the Green leader. Of the foursome, one was from Rajarata, another from Kalutara, still another from Galle and the fourth one  an elderly member from Colombo district. They were in readiness to sign the motion, when this information reached those at the highest echelons.
Soon afterwards, the foursome had received four separate calls from the palace conveying firm and precise orders. Thoroughly shaken, the four Blue stalwarts had immediately switched off their mobile phones and gone into hiding so that none could meet them or communicate with them.
So the final outcome was that Greens lost the four precious Blue party signatures for their confidence motion.

Islamic State claims attack on Christian family in Pakistan
	

Quetta REUTERS April 3 - The militant group Islamic State on Tuesday claimed responsibility for killing four members of a Christian family in southwestern Pakistan.  A statement issued by the group claimed that militants belonging to ISIS fired on the group of Christians as they were travelling in the city of Quetta, killing four on Monday.  Islamic State has affiliates in both Afghanistan and Pakistan, many drawn from existing Islamist militant groups, who support their vehement sectarian views against Shiite Muslims and non-Muslims. 
The family was travelling in a rickshaw when armed men on a motorcycle intercepted them and opened fire in Quetta city, the capital of Baluchistan province. The family had come to visit relatives in Quettas Shahzaman road area, where a large number of the citys Christian community lives.

Its all mere sound and fury
	

Ever since the fortuitous circumstance that saw the current Green leader taking over the helm of the monolithic political party with a glorious past, the sensational news that the energetic moves were afoot to replace the leadership and other key post holders with new ones hit the public domain from time to time.

However, this piece of news that followed a periodical trend proved to be the proverbial tale by an idiot every time it broke out.
The talk about changing the key post holders in the Green party including the party leader took centre-stage once again ever since the treasury bond scam took the complexion of a major national issue in the country.
However, going by the latest news, moves now being made appear to be aimed at playing a game of musical chairs with the leader remaining pat in his position rather than at replacing the key post holders with new blood, they say.
The Green heavyweight from the Kegalle district has reportedly been asked to take over the partys chairmanship conceding his secretarial post to the leaders blue-eyed boy handling education. However, it is not clear what is in store in the party for the leaders intimate school mate now holding the post of chairman.
The party leadership had begun looking for a suitable candidate for the post of party chairman as the stalwart from the Kegalle district had put his foot down that he would not accept it. Meanwhile, the majority of the party rank and file had agreed that the mild-mannered, soft-spoken scion from the respected Green political family from Beruwela was the ideal person for the party chairmanship.
However, the seasoned politico who had been denied his due status in the party on a number of occasions had declined the post.
So all indications are that the much hyped Green party shake-up that started with a big bang this time round too is destined to end up as a damp squib, they say.

Meanwhile, Number One has decided to place a taboo on politicos seeking this much coveted post. He seems to have accepted the general opinion that the gentlemans game is destined to suffer setbacks whenever it is under the thumb of a politico, they say.
Meanwhile, an active politico, the incumbent who is said to be on numerous missions on behalf of Number One these days, had recently sought his (latters) permission to seek the post this time round too.
However, Number Ones response had been a firm no, they say.
The politico, highly enamoured with this prestigious post, is not prepared to give it up easily and is said to be looking for other means of retaining it come hell or high water or the next election.

Memories of a loving grandma
	
Today we remember the life of Monica Phyllis De Alwis, wife of late Lucian Aaron Percival De Alwis, of Dehiwela. A Mother to 6 girls and 5 boys, a grandmother to 25 grandchildren and a great grandmother to 12 great grandchildren, she was born in Kurunegala. Her parents were Esther Perera and Chevalier C.L.W.Perera. They had 12 children.
I first came to her loving arms on the day I was born. Since then she had been caring for me. I was told by my mother that she bathed me all by herself until I was one year old. My grandmother was a strength for my mother. When malli and I fell sick she would come and spend all night until our temperatures returned to normalcy.
I remember how I spent my childhood days at my grand parents house which is not far away from our home. Most often my brother and I spent time with our grandparents. We played with cousins, watched TV and climbed trees and rooftops fell into all mischief which my grandmamma thought was natural given we were growing up. She used to treat all of us with cakes that was sold by a man who came in a bicycle. She also bought us Waltz Ice Cream and we given the opportunity to select which ever flavour we liked.
She would tell us about our uncles and aunts and funny stories about their younger days and about the neighbors who lived in the early years of her life. Christmas time was very happy and an exciting time for her. I still remember how she would wrap all the gifts secretly so that Santa Claus could give them away on Christmas day. But Malli and I were shrewd enough to find that out but we pretend not to know. When my mother made something special it was my job to take them to my grandmothers home and every time I was rewarded with sweets (Seeni bola). When ever I helped grandmother, Malli used to tease me Star points from grandmother.
The sad day came when grandfather had the call from Heaven. It was an extremely sad period for grandmother. She survived with her prayers and the utmost faith she had in God. Then she came to live with us in our home. Malli and I were lucky to get the love of two mothers. Grandmother spent most of her time resitting the rosary. She never missed the Holy hour. When we had exams we always asked grandmother to pray for us.
When I was leaving to Melbourne for the first time she was very sad. I have in my room the picture Foot Steps which she gifted me. For me the fondest memory of her dates back to January 2016. After my vacation I left home to return to Melbourne. she did not want to go to bed at her usual time, but waited to bid me Farewell. I can still picture her face at that moment.
Sixth of April 2017 was a sad day. She left all of us. I guess we were not ready to let her go just yet as she was our family matriarch and the bond that kept the extended family together and stronger. We all loved her immensely. 
I think I should mention how our family dog, who always sat by her chair, continued to stay for 3 days beneath her mortal remains at our home.
I would like to thank you grandmother for the love you gave me, for the lessons taught to me that I must keep faith in Jesus and giving my mother. Grandmother, I know you are in a better place along with Grandfather. Goodbye until we meet again! 
 YOU NEVER DIE AGAIN,
WELL NEVER CRY AGAIN ,
WELL MEET SOME DAY
IN PARADISE (ALL ) TOGETHER.

Official opposition in disarray
	

The elderly politico from the East occupying the main chair in the opposition had flown to New Delhi amid the growing din from the no- confidence motion.

By the way, it is a given that whenever a national issue here hots ups, political high-ups from the North would become political pilgrims bound for the Indian capital. However, in this particular case, the opposition bigwig had taken wing to New Delhi for a heart surgery in a hospital there, they say.
Some have heard on the grapevine that elderly politico had a secret meeting with some Green party high-ups and had conveyed the assurance that at least four or five members of his party had decided not to back the no confidence motion.
Meanwhile, another heavyweight from the main political entity in the North had left for the country famous for watchmaking.
Some political observers wonder whether the foreign visits by the Northern bigwigs has anything to do with their frustrating bids to tame some rebels within the party.

He had walked into the committee room at Diyawanna complex where the meeting was to be held on time to find to his dismay that only four members had turned up to raise their voice against the practice of using poisonous substances in the agricultural and plantation sectors. Highly disappointed, the monk had cancelled the meeting saying that if the majority were in favour of the use of poison, there was no purpose in launching a struggle against it.

Prize-hunters were a nuisance
	

Several ambitious characters had become a big nuisance to Number One in the recent past, they say.

They were none other than some turncoats who on the eve of the recent mini-poll made a dramatic appearance on political stage vowing their heart and soul support to Number One to achieve the goal of a clean administration.

These turncoats, in fact, found place in the delegation that accompanied Number One on his recent state visit to Nippon. The news that the three year-tenure of certain governing ones was about to expire had kindled their ambitions and they had rushed to the palace to stake their claims to high posts about to fall vacant.   
Of these turncoats, the worst irritants in his side had been a persistent duo - ones who turned their back on Panchaudha and a pole-vaulter from another party. Finding these high post aspirants becoming a source of vexation, Number One had nipped the trouble in the bud by suddenly granting another three- year term extension to the incumbents. After all, Number One may have taken into consideration that the support extended by these characters at the eleventh hour had not helped prevent the heavy defeat the Blues had to suffer, they say.

Royal brotherhood brings lessons worth teaching
	
The Royal College Class of 1958 comprised One hundred and forty (140) 10 and11-year olds from all over the Island. These students represented all strata of society and all religions, spoke Sinhala or Tamil at home and also managed a smattering of English. Some came to school by bus, others by car, a few by bicycle and a few walked to school, whilst another group lived in the school hostel. 
Those age old values that kept this country together, would keep us together in the future too
Very quickly we grew up to be the Royal Brotherhood  and defined ourselves unashamedly as Royalists, very much like those a hundred years and more before us, and how, many generations after us, will define themselves very proudly. 
About forty of us met recently, on the 8th of March, for an evening of reminiscence, nostalgia and camaraderie  60 years after that first meeting in January 1958. We have been meeting twice annually for about forty years  during the Royal-Thomian Big Match and during the Christmas holidays when those overseas, return home to see their families. Some of our Royalist brothers have in the years moved to U.K., U.S.A., Canada, Australia, Myanmar (Burma), Pakistan,New Zealand and many other exotic countries. Those who could make it this year were Ranil from Scotland, Knightly and Amjad from England and Ranjith and Upali from Sydney. 
In past years we had Tin Maung Lwin from Myanmar, Afaq Rizvi from Pakistan/USA, Mayura Boteju from USA/Pakistan, David Ferdinands from Toronto, Prasanna Weerasinghe from California, Rudran Shanmuganathan and Miles Mylvaganam from Sydney, Upali Gunasekera from Perth, Ravi Gooneratne from Christchurch and many others visiting us. When we - the island bound - travel overseas, we are often hosted by our Royalist brothers in those cities. 
We have seen the assassination of two national leaders (SWRD and R.Premadasa) and numerous other leaders (Gamini Dissanayake, Lalith Athulathmudali, Amirthalingam, Tiruchelvam, et al) and thousands of our best and talented youth - sacrificed on the altar of ethno-religious disharmony. 
We believe, our schoolboy rivals S. Thomas, Trinity, St. Peters, St. Josephs, St. Benedicts, Ananda,
Nalanda, Thurstan, Isipatana, Carey, Wesley, Zahira and the 125-year-old Hameed al Hussainiya - schools in Colombo and in the suburbs, too have rich traditions that should be cherished, borne friendships lasting lifetimes  crossing ethno-religious boundaries. 
We learned of books and men (and life) from our teachers  lovingly known as Dudley, Kataya, Bella, Ruperty, Pol Tokka, Wariyapola, Bruin, Alavi, Sariffodeen, Thamba, Ratnathicam, Conner, Mudguard, Lena, Canto, Arasa, Pope, Kotta Silva, EFC, Rev. Kahaduwe Ratnajothi and many others, who represented the rich tapestry of Sri Lankas ethno-religious backgrounds. They taught us that it was the strength of character that defined a man. 
Our nation is beset by new challenges  the radicalisation of one community by bad leaders could easily lead to the radicalisation of other communities. Todays youth, the future leaders of Sri Lanka, forged by the fires of great institutions such as Royal, should join hands across ethno-religious divides and wipe out the menace of disharmony that raises its head from time to time, in robes and thobes, to promote arson, looting, murder and mayhem. 
Those age old values that kept this country together, would keep us together in the future too  in spite of the aberrations that surface from time to time, to plunge our diverse community into a rabid dog type failed state that leads to fractious violent conflict! 
Very quickly we grew up to be the Royal Brotherhood  and defined ourselves unashamedly as Royalists, very much like those a hundred years and more before us, and how, many generations after us, will define themselves very proudly
Royalist Mangala Samaraweeras passionate plea to withdraw the civic rights of Politicians who promote ethno-religious disharmony deserves the support of all right thinking citizens. 
Love for Sri Lanka
Our abiding friendship, heedless of the ethno-religious origins of our brother Royalists, should be the gold standard to be followed by our fellow Sri Lankans, whose love for Sri Lanka should cross all man-made boundaries of religion, language and ethnicity. 
Amongst the Class of 58, Muslims have married Sinhalese, Sinhalese have married Tamils, Buddhists have married Christians, Christians have married Muslims with all of these unions flourishing into the third and fourth decades, because we believe in humanity and regardless of religion and language, ethnicity and pedigree, we are all one  deserving mutual respect, and celebrating extraordinary friendships that have been cherished for centuries.

The son of self-styled Gemunu from the South had married an Iranian girl and the wedding was held at Mount Lavinia Hotel the other day.

Gemunu had invited all his onetime Diyawanna colleagues to his sons wedding. The Green leader and a good number of Green party Diyawanna members had attended the wedding. The Blue party purohita from the South holding secretarial status too had been invited, but he was not seen at the wedding, they say. Gemunu is said to have experienced a keen disappointment when a special invitee of his had failed to turn up; he was none other than the former strongman.
In the morning of the wedding day, a security detail of the former strongman had turned up at the hotel to check the security arrangements. But later the former boss had sent word to Gemunu saying that he was indisposed.
Some trying to interpret the real reason behind former strongmans decision to give the event the miss, openly wondered that he might have felt that it would be rather embarrassing to sit at the same table with the Greens at a time when tensions over the no confidence were running high.
Nevertheless, the former strongman had later rung up Gemunu several times possibly to apologize for his inability to attend the event. However, Gemunu was too upset to answer these calls, they say.

The white collar bigwigs holding high office like him are not entitled to payment for working overtime. However, this one had claimed an overtime payment amounting to about Rs. 200,000.
His subordinates had pointed out to him that given his high post he was not entitled to overtime, but the man used to bulldozing his way through any obstacle had obtained the payment.
Later the story about the boss claiming overtime spread among the employees like wildfire. Even the purohita in charge of the subject of lands had come to hear about it and had questioned the white collar bigwig about it.
Disconcerted that even the purohita had come to know about his overtime claim, the white collar one had sent for the lady in charge of accounts and berated her for leaking out the information.
However, the man had realized too late that he had caught a Tartar for the lady with a backbone had hit back the boss expressing her opinion about him in strong terms. She had later quit the job saying that she could not work in a place where the boss was a rogue.
Although the lady had quit, the white collar bigwig continues as the boss of the place. Meanwhile, the employees who openly discuss his doings express their surprise and anger at the political authorities for turning a blind eye to the goings-on in this state-run body.

At least 59 people, including Taliban commanders meeting at the compound in the Dashte Archi district in Kunduz province, were killed in the attack, Afghan security sources told AFP on condition of anonymity. 
Most of the civilian victims were children, they said. 
I myself counted 35 bodies, Abdul Khalil told AFP at the hospital in the provincial capital Kunduz where health officials said 57 injured had been taken. 
I arrived at the scene right after the airstrikes -- it was like a butchers shop. Everywhere was covered with blood, the ground was littered with body parts, heads, limbs and other parts.

The University Trade Union Joint Committee (UTUJC) today decided to continue its strike action because the authorities had failed to issue a circular on the agreement reached with the Higher Education and Highways Minister Kabir Hashim on Monday.
It had earlier decided to suspend the work stoppage after the higher education authorities agreed to grant a ten percent increment to the lieu leave allowance of the University non-academic staff.
UTUJC Chairman Edward Malwattage said though negotiations were carried out the circular on the agreement had not been issued.
He said though the minister had agreed to grant their demands the officials keep delaying to carry out the ministers instructions and therefore the 15,000 non-academic staff would continue with their work stoppage launched on February 27.
This has resulted in the academic activities at some 15 State universities and higher education institutions functioning under the purview of the University Grants Commission (UGC) coming to a standstill. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
