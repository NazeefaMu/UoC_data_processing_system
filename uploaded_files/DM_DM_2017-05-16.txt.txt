Air strikes target Islamic State in eastern Syria, kill 23
	

HINDUSTAN TIMES, 15th MAY, 2017- Dawn air strikes on a Syrian border town in the Islamic State-held eastern province of Deir al-Zor killed 23 people, most of them civilians, a war monitoring group said on Monday.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said jets thought to belong to the US-led coalition hit the town of Al-Bukamal near the border with Iraq.
The warplanes struck near a residential area and a mosque, wounding dozens more, the Britain-based monitor said.
The Islamic State-linked media outlet Amaq said coalition strikes killed 15 people and wounded 35 others in Al-Bukamal.
A spokesman for the US-led coalition against Islamic State could not immediately be reached for comment.
Islamic State holds most of Deir al-Zor province, apart from an enclave at the centre and a nearby air base that Syrian government forces control.

BOC continues to dominate as No.1 brand for 9th consecutive year
	
Sri Lankas No.1 bank yet again reinstates itself as the No.1 brand in Sri Lanka for the 9th consecutive year according to the latest Brand Finance Sri Lankas records published on Brands Annual by Media Services.
The Sri Lankan partner of Brand Finance UK which is a leading body which has a global network in 17 countries, Brand Finance Lanka revealed BOC brand as the No.1 brand with the value standing at Rs.40. billion.
Empowering Sri Lankans to realize their life goals through affordable yet best-in-class banking solutions, in its steadfast journey of over 77 years, the Bank of Ceylon has always gone that extra mile to add value to Sri Lankan banking industry.
With the pledge to commit as Bankers to the Nation since its inception the bank has been evolving with the needs and lifestyle of the Sri Lankan community to provide the financial assistance they require.
The first and the only Sri Lankan single business entity to earn PBT of Rs.25.3 billion for 2015 and PBT Rs.31.2 billion for 2016, BOC challenged its own record continuing its quest to strive for exceptional performance in all areas of banking.
Two very significant achievements of BOC in recent history were the surpassing Rs. 1 trillion in deposits in 2015 and Rs. 1 trillion advances in 2016. The banks asset value now exceeds Rs. 1.6 trillion and is the highest asset base owned by a single business entity in the country.
Maintaining our position as the No.1 brand in the country is an achievement like no other. Anyone would agree with me that being the No.1 brand in the country for the 9th consecutive year is an unmatchable achievement. We have done exceptionally well during past years and now we are the only bank that has three trillion in the balance sheet. Our next goal is to enhance the banks asset base up to Rs. 2 trillion by 2019-this will surely be another milestone in the Sri Lankan banking industry. The Banks Chairman, Presidents Counsel Ronald C. Perera stated.
The banks approach to cater to the very dynamic banking needs of its customer base has been the key factor behind BOC brands 77 year long success. Since its inception in 1939, Bank of Ceylons motive was the same as promoting social and economic development of the country and its people. As such the bank has been strategically adapting its products and services portfolio with the understanding of future social and economic trends that requires tailor-made banking and financial services. A very recent example was the BOCs digital transformation that completely changed the banks internal processes along with its customer interface and infused synergy to the whole Sri Lankan banking system. Along with the benefits of digital transformation BOC was able to embark on Green Banking comprehensively for a sustainable growth together with the community, stated D.M. Gunasekera, General Manager Bank of Ceylon.

CEB to introduce new payment system
	
The Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya today said that Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) had introduced a new payment system for consumers to pay their electricity bill according to their daily usage but will not affect the ongoing bill.
Addressing the media today at the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry, Minister Siyambalapitiya said the consumers can join only if they like.
The CEB and the Lanka Electricity Company (Pvt) Ltd., (LECO) had given an opportunity to its customers to identify a time pattern in which can be shift according to the Time of the day terrify.
Accordingly, the proposal was made by the CEB and it had been approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) to implement the system.
The time period of the consumers to use electricity can be used for their activities as follows.
According to the new system the electricity usage of Rs.13 per one unit would be charged from 10.30 pm to 05.30am. Rs.25 per unit will be charged for the users from 5.30am to 6.30pm, while Rs.54 per unit would be charged for the electricity users from 6.30pm to 10.30pm.
The intension of introduction of the tariff system is not to increase the current rates for electricity customers. This new system will provide a single phase electricity customers to minimize their power consumption during the highest peak at 6.30 am to 10.30 am, the Minster said.
The consumers can adapt to this new system only if they wanted to. For that they had to request a special electricity meter unit as similar to the smart metering system. Once they obtained the new system the consumer will get the benefit. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

## Title: GSP+ from Friday

GSP+ from Friday
	
 The European Union is most likely to announce the granting of the GSP+ trade facility to Sri Lanka via its official journal onThursday enabling Sri Lankan exporters to enjoy the benefits of duty-free exports from Friday, the European Union (EU) Delegation to Sri Lanka said.
EU Ambassador Tung Lai Margue said today the incentive would boost several categories of exports especially garments, rubber products and machinery to EU-member states.
With the regaining of the GSP+ trade facility, Sri Lanka will be able to increase its export revenue and thus reduce the trade deficit. The removal of import duties will provide a basket of immediate benefits worth a minimum of 300 million a year, the ambassador told a news conference.
The EU is Sri Lanka's biggest export market accounting for nearly one-third of Sri Lanka's global exports. In 2016, the total bilateral trade amounted to almost 4 billion.
Ambassador Margue said Sri Lanka should focus on economic diversification with new products being identified for export to reap the maximum benefits from this facility instead of relying on the export of traditional products.
He said while Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) would benefit from the GSP+ facility, the indirect benefits would include the attraction of foreign investments and increased employment opportunities for Sri Lankans.
Commenting on the lengthy process of re-granting the trade facility to Sri Lanka, the Ambassador said the EU assessed whether Sri Lanka was complying with the 27 UN conventions and whether it had implemented them effectively.
After careful assessment, it was considered that there were no serious failures in the way that these conventions were being implemented. This doesnt mean that everything is perfect in the country and that there is no need for further progress in number of areas. We are going to continue interacting with the government closely to achieve more progress, he said.
Ambassador Margue said this was not the end of the story of GSP+ because there would be a stringent monitoring process in place.
Biennial reports will be made on the progress made by Sri Lanka. The country cannot afford any more incidents which will reverse this progress. The type of pressure from other countries which had also applied for this facility will also apply on Sri Lanka and its government. We hope in the coming months, Sri Lanka will make more progress. The EU will remain vigilant on human rights, labour rights and other matters in this process, he said adding that the facility was granted after thorough examination of Sri Lankas application and not in a secretive manner.
There was a democratic debate in the European Parliament on re-granting GSP+ to Sri Lanka. This is a good example to show that things had not been done secretly. The EU thoroughly examined the application and the decision has been taken at various levels, the ambassador said.
The EU said, Sri Lanka is the first ever country to lose the GSP+ facility on basis of human rights shortcomings.
It said GSP+ will consist of the complete removal of duty on 66% of tariff lines, covering a wide array of products including textiles and fisheries.
Issuing a statement on Sri Lanka regaining the GSP+ trade facility, EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrm said this facility to Sri Lanka aims at providing the opportunity to the country to further develop economically on a sound foundation that advances human and labour rights, and in a manner that is environmentally sustainable.
It is also a vote of confidence from the EU that the Sri Lankan Government will maintain the progress it has made in implementing the international conventions. At the same time, no one is pretending that the situation is perfect. The process of replacing the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) still needs to be completed. There are still many incidents of torture, children being forced into marriage and laws that discriminate against sections of Sri Lankan society. We want to see an end to these practices, she said.
Ms. Malmstrom said the EU would work closely with Government and Non-Governmental Organisations to rigorously monitor progress.
The EU said if Sri Lanka continues to make necessary progress it has the chance of benefiting from this scheme for three consecutive years until it achieves the status of a Upper Middle Income country and based on current trends, it means that Sri Lanka would benefit from GSP+ until at least 2021.
Granting access to the GSP+ scheme does not mean that the situation of the beneficiary country with respect to the 27 international conventions is fully satisfactory. Instead, it offers the incentive of increased trade access in return for further progress towards the full implementation of those conventions, the EU said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

The lady flew into a rage when she discovered that the organizers had failed to carry her picture and an account befitting her status in the souvenir brought out to mark the event, they say.

This lady well known for her unladylike behaviour is said to be involved in a protracted feud with the chief minister in the province, who, by the way, happens to be close kin of hers.
She berated the organizers in a raised voice for deliberately omitting to make the traditional reference to the chief guest in the souvenir. Her shocking behaviour later gave way to immense amusement among those present, they say.

HK rejects asylum to Lankans, Filipinos who sheltered Snowden
	
Hong Kongs Immigration Department has rejected asylum requests made by a group of refugees, including Sri Lankans, who sheltered US fugitive Edward Snowden four years ago, foreign news agencies reported.
Their lawyer Robert Tibbo on Monday said immigration officials denied applications by the four adults and three children, in what he said is retaliation for helping Snowden. The applicants are from the Philippines and Sri Lanka.
Snowden hid in Hong Kong for two weeks in June, 2013, after he leaked documents revealing extensive US government surveillance. His whereabouts were a mystery during the time.
It was not until last year that the role Tibbo and his clients played in sheltering Snowden was revealed. Tibbo said his clients will appeal the ruling. They have also applied for refugee status in Canada.
The lawyer said that the families need to be brought to Canada immediately while the country processes their asylum claims.
Tibbo said Canada needs to take this exceptional step and allow the seven people to enter the country after the Hong Kong government rejected their asylum applications last Friday.
The seven people  four adults and their three children  allegedly helped hide Snowden when the fugitive was in the region in 2013 after he leaked documents revealing extensive U.S. government surveillance.
They were put in contact with Snowden because they share Tibbo as a lawyer.
Speaking from Hong Kong, through a video conference, surrounded by the seven refugee applicants, Tibbo told reporters they have two weeks to appeal the decision or risk deportation to their countries of origin, Sri Lanka and the Philippines, where they fear for their safety.
A non-profit group is attempting to raise the estimated $15,000 to cover the appeals.
The solution is Canada, he said, adding the country is one of a handful of jurisdictions that permit a review of refugee applications from people who havent been screened by the United Nations.
Tibbo said the Hong Kong government doesnt allow the UN to screen refugee applicants who enter the country.
One of the refugee applicants, Ajith, said he was convinced that he would be killed if he returns to Sri Lanka.

How to revive the  Grand Old Party
	
What the next generation of leaders say

The United National Party (UNP), the grand old party was formed six and a half decades ago with the leadership of the late Prime Minister D. S. Senanayake. His son late Dudley Senanayake took over as the party leader after his death. This is despite the expectations of people such as J. R. Jayewardene and Sir John Kothalawala who had prime ministerial ambitions and the striving to hold prominent positions in the party. The first UNP breakaway group, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) emerged in July 1951 when S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike and a few others left the party. In the midst of this situation the leadership actually changed, Dudley resigned from the party leadership and the premiership in the 1950s paving the way for Sir John to take over but made a comeback in 1960. Dudley continued as a leader till 1973. Then it was JRs turn to become the leader. However the dispute between JR and Dudley almost split the party. In the mid eighties another breakaway group led by Rukman Senanayake left the party and formed the Eksath Lanka Janatha Party (ELJP) 
In 1988 trouble started brewing once again when with Gamini Dissanayake, Lalith Athulathmudali and R. Premadasa were on a race to become Mr Jayewardenes successor. It was Premadasa who ultimately became Mr. Jayewardenes successor. The UNP suffered a big blow perhaps the worst in its history, when Lalith and Gamini left the party to form another party, and formed the Democratic United National Front (DUNF). Gamini returned in 1993 after Mr. Premadasas death and was on his way to become the party leader when he was killed by the LTTE. This paved the way for the present leader Ranil Wickremesinghe to take over as the leader. His tenure however was turbulent with a series of electoral losses and a large number of party seniors leaving the party. In spite of all that the party had come back to power after 10 years other than the short stint in power from 2001 to 2004. Mr. Wickremesinghes government formed in 2001 was defeated in April 2004. UNP faced a hard time since 2004 when several prominent members started leaving the party from time to time. Today the party is in power and questions are raised on how to consolidate its position. Mr. Wickremesinghe has stated a few times that the time had come for the party to think of future leaders. After these statements the re-organization of the party had come to the focus once again. However new ideas have been mooted this time. One such suggestion is to appoint a CEO. 
Daily Mirror talked to some of the young UNP MPs in order to get insides to their sentiments on the so-called re-organization. 
The majority of young MPs were in favour of appointing a CEO and to modernize the party. There were a few who favoured a change of positions but many of them were non committal on giving a position to Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka. Almost all the young MPs sounded alarmed on the publicity machinery of the UNP which they called a failure, and stressed for some effective mechanism to address the issue. 
Most of the young MPs were of the opinion that grooming of future leaders is a long term issue as the present leader can go on for some more years. Some want a balanced party where both the seniors and the younger ones can play a role, and thereby future leaders could be groomed. 
Following are the sentiments expressed by the young MPs. 

Party will be balanced if both young and the old are given opportunities
HarshanaRajakaruna
The United National Party (UNP) should move with time and change accordingly. The Party should adopt modern management tactics. A CEO can help the party without a doubt. It will benefit the party. 
There is nothing wrong in giving a position to Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka as he is a capable person. There are equally capable people in the party. Sajith Premadasa is doing a fine job at the grass root level. There are others such as Kabir Hashim, Ravi Karunanayake, Malik Samarawickrama and Lakshman Kiriella who are also very capable. The Field Marshal will boost the party further. The party will be balanced if both young and the old are given opportunities. UNP has that balance at the moment but has potential to increase this further. 
The party appeals to the ordinary people in the same way that it has been, since the beginning. The Party is currently handled according to the needs and aspirations of the grass root level members. However there are some members who have aspirations of gaining employment in the state sector. This has become an issue today as we are governing together with the SLFP. I think there should be a negotiation with the SLFP in this regard. 
I feel that the present leader should lead the party at the 2020 elections and continue from there. He has the capability of leading the party for some more years. 

We must be delivery oriented and reward good performances.
Harsha De Silva
The UNP has never been a party controlled by any family. Based on its multi-ethnic and multi-religious foundation on a democratic structure we have now reached the stage of maturity and modernity. We need to change to adapt to the changing socio-economic, political and technological changes that are taking place in the society. We must be delivery oriented and reward good performances. In order to do that we should have a business-like structure with identified key performance indicators. In such a structure a full time CEO is essential where he or she has the delegated authority to make key decisions within the broad policy direction adopted by the party leadership. These decisions must be just, evidence-based and equitable; sometimes not possible with a purely political decision making context. I am fully supportive of the proposed new structure. 
The present leader should continue further. Ranil Wickremesinghe is a modern leader with a fantastic vision. He should continue to lead, to ensure Sri Lanka is once and for all on a steady path of economic growth. We must get our knowledge-based, highly competitive, social market economy implemented. The CEO should be reporting to the leader. 

A major change is needed in the publicity machinery
Ajith P. Perera

The party has not been able to take its message to the people effectively. Besides, people are not informed on the development activities that the government is currently carrying on. The party has not been able to handle the media effectively. For instance the party has not been able to market its successful May Day rally. We brought more than 150,000 people to Colombo on that day but we failed to gain a political mileage from it. 
On that score what the party needs is to change its publicity machinery. Publicity machinery that can handle social media in particular is an essential need. A major change is needed in this aspect. 
I dont see that the party has a philosophical need. Our party is not pro-western though some people seem to feel like it. It was our party that introduced the open economy in 1977. However the party has moved away from this stance now and had begun to favour a social market economy. 
I dont think the party should rush to make changes in the positions. The government we have formed will go on till 2020. The country may not face another presidential election and the next general election is due in 2020, if we go on to serve our full term. In such a scenario, the time is not right to think of changing the positions including the leadership. 
What we should do is to put in a strong effort to work for the people within the next three years. 
A number of new ideas have been mooted to modernize the party. One such idea is to appoint a Chief Executive officer. The Partys constitution has to be amended for such a thing. The best options should be selected and implemented. 

The aspirations of the grass root level members should be fulfilled
Mujibur Rahaman

The working committee has only had an initial discussion on the re-organization. However decisions are not made yet. The committees have been appointed to look into it. The changes would probably come in July. 
I feel that there should be a broad discussion about the issue. We too are ready to give ideas on party reforms if the matter is discussed with us. 
However my opinion is that the aspirations of the grass root level members should be fulfilled. There should be a proper programme to fulfill these. 
Decisions pertaining to appointing a chief executive officer have to be made by the senior leaders of the party. 
I feel that the present leader should continue for few more years. However I think an effective team of second level leaders will have to be established. 
In addition an able team who should handle publicity should be appointed so that partys message could be taken to people. 

The party should have a central body which is in charge of publicity
Harin Fernando

The main issue with the party is that the people are not aware what the government has done during the last two years. This has a negative effect on our party. That is what we discussed at the last working committee meeting. If I may give an instance, there was an issue with the tea prices and the players in the industry were affected badly. However the price of tea had gone up to Rs. 100 per kilo compared to Rs. 50 some time back. We as a party had failed to capitalize this situation. Therefore we need some effective strategy to market these achievements. 
This is why we decided that the party should have a central body which is in charge of publicity. We also thought of a structural change. 
These are welcomed always. Having a Chief Executive Officer is also an effective move as it will be give the party a modern face. Political parties in many countries have such non-political positions. Such positions are needed when a party is in power as the political leaders have to spend time running their ministries and concentrate on Parliament. The leader can handover some responsibilities with regard to the party to the Chief Executive officer. It is a good move. 
I dont think the allegation that the party not having a nationalistic appeal is valid. UNP is not a party that belongs to the stone-age. We always look at how the world is moving and change accordingly. We have to go on with the technology and other social changes of the world. A political party cannot be run in the traditional way anymore. 
We may have issues with the present leader but he has set the stage for the party to become a modernized entity. He has brought the party back to power. 

A full time CEO can handle the communication
Ruwan Wijewardene
The Party has to move with the times and should have a new structure. Accordingly having a full time CEO is a very welcome move. Such a re-organization process is needed for the party to win the next elections. 
The party had failed when it comes to communication. People are not aware of the good things which the government has done during the last two years. This is an area which one has to look at, when re-organizing the party. A full time CEO can handle the communication. 
Decisions pertaining to changes in the position should be decided upon by the working committee of the party. 
I dont think there is a dire need for the change in leadership now. The present leader guided the UNP when it was in the opposition and now when it is governing the country. Accordingly there is no need for an immediate change in the leadership  


Talented people should be recognized
Sujeewa Senasinghe
The Party must make use of talented people in the same way that the late President J. R. Jayewardene did in the 1970s. He groomed talented people such as Lalith Athulathmudali, Gamini Dissanayake and R. Premadasa. 
Talented people should be recognized right from the grassroots level. This means that able people should be recognized and made use of right from the Pradeshiya Sabha, Provincial Council and from the MP level. There are people who had been working hard for the party and they should be given proper positions. 
Responsible positions should be held by those able and approachable people. 
Appointing a CEO is not the solution to the issue, it is the office-bearers of the party that should be changed. 
The current leader could continue, but proper people should be groomed to take over the party in the long run.

IFC to provide up to US$50 mn senior loan to Nations Trust Bank
	
DEALSTREETASIA.COM: International Finance Corporation (IFC) has proposed to provide a senior loan of up to US $50 million to Sri Lankan mid-sized private commercial bank Nations Trust Bank PLC.
The five-year senior loan will be used by the bank to fund its expansion in the SME lending space, IFC said in a disclosure.
The financing provided is a fit with the World Bank and IFC strategy of promoting economic growth by providing access to finance to underserved market segments, thereby leading to job creation, said the World Banks private investment arm.
Nations Trust Bank was established in 1999 with IFC as a shareholder with 15 per cent stake. However, it divested the stake in 2004. Prominent investors in the bank include John Keells Holdings PLC Group and Central Finance Company PLC Group that hold 29.9 percent and 20.0 percent respectively. Other large shareholders include HWIC Asia Fund (Fairfax Group) with a 15 percent stake and Janashakthi Insurance PLC (9.8 percent).
Headquartered in Colombo, Nations Trust Bank currently has 93 branches spread across
Sri Lanka.
It is involved in lending long- and medium-term products for corporates and SME, such as working capital, term loans, project and corporate finance and several short-term products.
Nations Trust Bank has also been a trade finance client of IFC since 2007. The project provides long-term, US dollar debt funding, not readily available from local or global investors at this time, said IFC.
The proposed project may involve advisory support to further develop NTBs SME lending programme; IFC is uniquely placed to share international best practices and knowledge in this regard, it added. Since 1956, IFC has invested over US$1 billion in Sri Lanka, and as of June 30, 2016, its committed portfolio stood at over
US $225 million.

Ironwood Investment ups stake in Abans Finance to over 30%
	
Ironwood Investment Holding (Pvt) Ltd. has increased its stake in Abans Finance PLC (AFSL) to 31.89 percent. Ironwood acquired 10.16 million AFSL shares for Rs.25 each through a rights issue, constituting 15.25 percent of the total shares in AFSL. Prior to the rights issue, Ironwood held 11.07 million shares in AFSL, equal to 19.95 percent of the shares in AFSL.
The 21.23 million shares Ironwood holds in AFSL now constitutes to 31.89 percent of its total shares. A market source said that AFSL parent Abans PLC, which held 71.60 percent of shares in its subsidiary prior to the rights issue, may not have subscribed to its full allotment of rights, allowing Ironwood to buy extra rights. It is not yet clear whether Abans and Ironwood could be classified as related parties, which may allow Ironwood to not opt for a mandatory offer. Even if a mandatory offer is announced, Ironwood would have to purchase all remaining shares for Rs.25 each since it is the highest price Ironwood had purchased AFSL shares during the past year. Ironwood entered AFSL through a private placement in last November where it purchased 11.07 million AFSL shares at Rs.25 each. AFSL shares were trading almost Rs.36 per share yesterday. The rights issue, which raised Rs. 277.34 million, was intended to improve AFSLs future minimum capital adequacy requirements.

The Australian Border Forces largest patrol vessel Ocean Shield arrived in Trincomalee Port today as part of an official visit to Sri Lanka.
Australian Border Force said in a statement that this was the first visit by an Australian Border Force vessel to Sri Lanka and recognises our long-standing record of close cooperation to stamp out people smuggling across the region.
The Ocean Shield is just one of Australias extensive fleet of offshore vessels that conduct far-reaching patrols and responds to illegal activities including people smuggling, illegal fishing and transnational crime.
Commander of Operation Sovereign Borders, Air Vice-Marshal Stephen Osborne is accompanying Ocean Shield during the visit and said Australia is very grateful for
Sri Lankas on-going support to combat people smuggling.
Over recent years we have worked together to save many lives at sea and prevented vulnerable people being ripped off by people smugglers, Air Vice-Marshal Osborne said.
We value our strong relationship with Sri Lanka and this visit provides an important opportunity to advance our cooperation and share expertise on a wide range of maritime concerns.
Air Vice-Marshal Osborne said it has now been more than 1000 days since the last people smuggling boat made it to Australia.
Australias borders are now stronger than ever, and our tough border protection policies are here to stay.
Australia now operates the largest and most capable maritime surveillance and response fleet Australia has ever deployed. Anyone who attempts to reach Australia illegally by boat will be detected, intercepted and turned back.
There is a right way and a wrong way to travel to Australia. I encourage anyone who is thinking of getting on a people smuggling boat - do not put your life at risk or waste your money.
Settlement in Australia will never be an option for anyone who attempts to travel to Australia illegally by boat. There are no exceptions, Air Vice-Marshal Osborne said.

NDBIB goes regional with Ooredoo Maldives IPO
	
NDB Investment Bank (NDBIB) recently launched the Initial Public Offering (IPO) of Ooredoo Maldives PLC (Ooredoo Maldives) on the Maldives Stock Exchange acting as the lead financial advisor and manager to the IPO.
The mandate from Ooredoo Maldives, a subsidiary of Ooredoo Group, a global telecommunications service provider based in Qatar, signifies NDBIBs pioneering efforts as Sri Lankas first investment bank to handle an IPO outside Sri Lanka.
The IPO was launched in the Maldives with a gala ceremony on the 18th of April 2017 whilst the offer was opened for subscription on April 30th and is expected to close on 28th May.
The initial offer size is set at approximately US$ 43 million with a commitment from the shareholders to go up to US$ 115 million in the event of an oversubscription in line with the telecommunications licensing requirements in the Maldives.
Commenting on this landmark transaction, Vajira Kulatilaka, Director of NDBIB and CEO of NDB Capital Holdings Limited, stated, We are proud to be associated with Ooredoo Group in our maiden entry in managing regional IPOs. Our vision was to make NDBIB a regional player in both debt and equity capital markets, and I am delighted to see NDBIB achieve that feat with the Ooredoo Maldives IPO. Ooredoo Group is one of the fastest growing telecommunications service providersin the world with a customer base in excess of 138 million and operations in over 10 markets. The Group recorded revenue of approximately US$ 9 billion for the financial year 2016 andis backed by the Qatar Investment Authority, its major shareholder.Ooredoo Group focuses on data leadership in all its markets by striving to provide the best data experience to its customers.
Darshan Perera, CEO of NDBIB, commenting on the IPO said, NDBIB was awarded this transaction via a competitive bidding process followed by a comprehensive evaluation of technical and commercial proposals. The bidding process attracted participation from many prominent investment banks in the region and we are honoured to have been selected to handle this landmark IPO in the Maldives.
Ooredoo Maldiveshas recorded a stellar growth story since commencing commercial operations in 2005 as the second mobile operator. The company has invested over US$ 194 million over the years to provide best-in-class 4G connectivity to the entirety of Maldives. Ooredoo Maldives recorded revenues of US$ 105 million for FY 2016 with Profit After Tax of US$ 32 million.
Nilendra Weerasinghe, Vice President and Head-Corporate Advisory said, Conducting an IPO in a foreign jurisdiction involved many challenges. We deployed a relatively large transaction team to work on different aspects of the IPO including familiarising ourselves with the regulatory regime, carrying out business due diligence and valuations, and devising a placement strategy considering the needs of the company and the nascent stage of the capital market.
Ooredoo Maldives has taken a keen interest to broad base the ownership of the company with local roadshows covering all densely populated areas in the archipelago. The company has also been working in close collaboration with the Capital Market Development Authority of Maldives and the Maldives Stock Exchange to maximize retail investor participation for the IPO. NDBIB has worked closely with the Company to create an all-encompassing distribution and marketing strategy targeting both retail and institutional investors to achieve the companys objectives.
NDBIB is the market leader in investment banking in Sri Lanka and intends to proactively pursue market opportunities in the South Asian region.
The experience gained from managing the landmark IPO of Ooredoo Maldives provides unmatched credentials to NDBIB on the back of its strong track record advising many telecommunications service providers in Sri Lanka in their IPOs, mergers and acquisitions, debt raising and other advisory transactions.

No country helped SL to overcome economic crisis: PHU
	
Though the President and the Prime Minister had said that Sri Lanka has won the hearts of the International Community, no foreign country has offered help to save Sri Lanka when its confronted with the economic crisis, the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) said yesterday.
It said real friends are the ones who come forward in their hour of need but no such friend had helped Sri Lanka today.
Whats the point of a friendship if it wont open up a countrys market for our products, workers or wont invest in our country Buddha said these are the friends who pretend like friends but foe in nature. They express affection, shake hand and give assurance but not willing to help those who are in dire need of help, PHU General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila said.
He said the government accused them of making false statements when they highlighted economic crisis in the country. He said the Central Bank (CB) report 2016 issued by the Governor clearly indicates what they have been highlighting.
The CB report says the GDP has decreased to US$ 3727 from US$ 3744 in 2015 and the Export revenue had been dropped to US$ 10,310 million from US$ 10,546 million in 2015. The foreign reserves had been diluted and Sri Lankas economy is in major crisis, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

When a responsible officer submitted the file on the subject to the high-up seeking his approval to purchase two new tyres, the latter sent back the file with a minute instructing that an insurance claim be made to replace the damaged tyres.

No intention of increasing electricity bill: Minister
	
The Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya today said there is no intention of increasing electricity charges under any circumstances.
Addressing the media at his ministry yesterday he said the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) is now facing many difficulties on providing electricity due to the prevailing dry weather condition.
There is only 28 percent water capacity left at reservoirs for hydro power generation because of not having sufficient rainfall during the North East monsoon between last December and March and during the South West monsoon (from June to October), the Minister said.
Minister Siyambalapitiya also said, due to several failures of the Norochcholai Thermal power plant, the huge damage cause to the power transmission tower at Meethotamulla due to the garbage dump collapse and not having sufficient rainfall, the Ministry had to spend Rs.27.5 billion other than the cost of the ordinary hydro power supply, to provide uninterrupted power supply.
If this drought weather condition continues the CEB had estimated to spend a sum of more than Rs.50 billion for thermal power generation and the proposal had been approved by the government considering this situation as a disaster situation. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

REUTERS, 15th MAY, 2017- Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Monday that intelligence services should beware of creating software that can later be used for malicious means - a reference to global ransomware attacks that researchers say exploited a hacking tool built by the US National Security Agency.
Speaking to reporters in Beijing, where he is taking part in a conference, Putin said that there was no significant damage to Russian institutions, including its banking and healthcare systems, from the computer worm known as WannaCry.
But as a whole it is worrying, theres nothing good about it, it is a source of concern. As regards the source of these threats, I believe that the leadership of Microsoft have announced this plainly, that the initial source of the virus is the intelligence services of the United States, Putin said.
Once theyre let out of the lamp, genies of this kind, especially those created by intelligence services, can later do damage to their authors and creators, he added.
So this question should be discussed immediately on a serious political level and a defence needs to be worked out from such phenomena.
Putin said that Russia was not behind the attack.

SL Govt. should return to good governance: ICG
	
The Sri Lankan government needs to return to its original good governance and reconciliation agenda to salvage the chance to address fundamental sources of conflict and instability, the International Crisis Group (ICG) today said.
The ICG recognizes itself as an independent organisation working to prevent wars and shape policies which would create a more peaceful world.
In a report titled Sri Lankas Transition to Nowhere which was published on Tuesday, the ICG said President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe must reach workable compromises on key issues.
Economic reform that shares the pain of change equitably and renewed anti-corruption, anti-impunity drives that prioritise a limited number of significant criminal cases implicating both major parties are some of the key issues, the report said.
President Sirisena must speak forcefully and lead a campaign that explains the reform packages benefits for all communities to achieve a deal on the constitution that includes strengthened devolution.
Renewing transitional justice hopes requires rapid launch of the Office on Missing Persons and faster progress on reducing the military footprint in the north and east.
Packaged as part of rule-of-law reforms that include prosecuting alleged corruption and political crimes under the Rajapaksas, transitional justice could yet gain support across communities.
But time is running out. Leaders in both parties should not discount a Rajapaksa return. For their own survival and to deliver on at least some of their big promises, they should reject chauvinistic politics and daily bickering and invest their political capital in promoting an inclusive vision and set up a more accountable polity that can mitigate the risk of new conflict, the report said.
It said two years into President Maithripala Sirisenas term, Sri Lankas fragile hopes for lasting peace and cooperation across party and ethnic lines are imperilled.
Despite significant achievements in the coalition governments first nine months, progress on most of its reform agenda has slowed to a crawl or been reversed. As social tensions rise and the coalition slowly fractures, it is unclear whether it can push its signature new constitution through parliament and to a national referendum, it said.
As the government struggles with large budget deficits and dangerously high debt, hopes for improved living standards have been frustrated, further eroding trust in it and strengthening the appeal of the Rajapaksa-led opposition, the report said.
SLFP ministers were never enthusiastic about being the junior partner in a unity government with their long-time rival, the United National Party (UNP), and are unhappy with what many see as UNP arrogance and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes less-than-consultative style.
Pro-Sirisena SLFP ministers oppose any changes requiring a referendum, which would rule out key reforms, including compromises reached with the Tamil National Alliance to strengthen provincial devolution instead of the federalism they had favoured, it said.
