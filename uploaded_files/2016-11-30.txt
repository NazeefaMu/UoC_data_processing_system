A ?balancing? programme to go on air soon
	
?
The country?s ?palace? has received a plethora of complaints from a cross-section of the society saying that a certain state-owned media institution is airing programmes calculated to denigrate certain deities being worshipped by a large of number believers in the country.?
?
Comments considered derogatory of the Kataragama deity made by a group of academics featured in a recently aired programme ?in particular had come in for flak from political heavyweights as well as some intellectuals and scholars in the country.?
On being asked as to why programmes insulting and ridiculing some popular deities were being aired, the head of the media institution concerned had said apologetically that he had already instructed the producers to televise a ?balancing? program me as well. ?A programme with kapuralas from the Kataragama Devalaya as resource personnel will be aired,? he had promised. That programme was aired last week.

A jump from the bench to a political seat?
	
?
Reports from the North say that an ?arbiter? occupying a high chair in the administration of justice is planning to take to politics in a big way following in the footsteps of a political bigwig in the same province and with the latter?s blessings.
?
The arbiter?s planned advent to politics had been the subject of discussion at a rendezvous held recently behind closed doors. A certain legal eagle who once held high office in the State legal sector and later functioned as an advisor to some militant outfits and also a political bigwig from the North had participated in the deliberations which revolved around sponsoring the arbiter?s debut in politics at the polls in the offing.?

Add life to your years and not years to your life: NDB Wealth
	
?Eat healthy. Don?t skip breakfast. Sleep well. Get adequate and regular exercise. Drink plenty of water. Everybody knows this simple magic formula for a healthy and robust life. But how many actually follow it?? asks Christina Wesley, a Financial Advisor at NDB Wealth, the expert financial planner.
Similarly, everyone knows that saving and investing small amounts of money consistently over a long period of time results in wealth accumulation. Again, how many actually do it?
Take a closer look at NDB Wealth?s 2017 theme, the ?Greatest Wealth is Health? and you will realize that both your health and your finances both require equal amounts of attention, being virtually two sides of the same coin.
?Let us look at diabetes as an example,? says Wesley. She adds that according to the most recent World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates, about 347 million people worldwide have diabetes with it being predicted to become the seventh leading cause of death in the world by the year 2030. Further, statistics from the Diabetes Association of Sri Lanka (DASL) reveal that there are nearly four million people with diabetes in Sri Lanka. Diabetes prevalence amongst people aged 20 years and above, in urban populations, was 16 percent, while a similarly aged group in rural areas was at 8 percent. Being overweight and lack of exercise were the main causes of diabetes amongst children, while family history of diabetes, bad eating habits and obesity were the main indicators for diabetes amongst adults.?
?Sedentary and stressful lifestyles slowly and stealthily eat away at our inherent natural immunity to disease. Unaware of this slow corrosion going on within us, we go on with our routines, doing nothing at all to undo or repair the self-inflicted damage,? comments Wesley.
A common mantra today is ?work hard and play harder? but there should also be time to stop, think and reflect on how to improve your life. Be aware of the steady wear and tear of your body and the need to replenish it on a continuous basis for a healthier life.
With scientific and medical breakthroughs, we have managed to increase life expectancy substantially over just the last few decades. However, have we managed to stay healthier and happier over these longer life spans? To improve our quality of life, we need to take better care of ourselves and do so over the long term. But this process has to start today, since nothing happens overnight.?
?It is no different when it comes to our savings and building a nest egg,? says Wesley. As with the physical fitness needed to lead a healthy life, a disciplined financial regimen is required to be maintained from today onward to enjoy the latter stages of our lives, without fretting too much about expenses. This is where a ?Regular Savings Plan?, offered by NDB Wealth, via a Money Market Fund or an Income Fund plays an important role in improving one?s long-term financial health.?
?Small but regular amounts of investments over a sustained period can help build sizeable amounts of wealth for the future. Hence, regardless of our age, gender and profession, we need to focus on both our health and wealth. And we need to get started start right away,? comments Wesley. Also, she advises always consulting an investment adviser and/or tax consultant prior to making any investment decision.

An anxious nation waits silently?
	
?
?Self-respect is the root of discipline: The sense of dignity grows with the ability to say no to oneself.? ~ Abraham Joshua Heschel?
It is indeed a great experience to commute between work and home in Colombo. The traffic jams, the painstaking waiting at traffic lights which are turned off during the worst hours so that a live constable could direct traffic without allowing the undisciplined motorists to beat the red light and thereby cause new jams which are beyond the realm of road-discipline and to unscramble the traffic gridlock is a herculean task, whether the duty officer is an experienced one or not. To move again is a dream come true. Day in and day out, those who use our roads are confronted with this awfully distasteful task of navigating in a stormy ocean of traffic, motor and pedestrian, trying one?s way. A moving nightmare, this spectacle plays out without a break, mirroring a nation whose compass is lost for some time; sometimes, never to find it again in this lifetime.?
This pitiful panorama of life at large is being displayed out for all to see and experience, reflecting a people?s impatience, their callous disregard for law and order, failure on the part of those who are charged with maintaining a semblance of order and discipline on road, the Traffic Police. Politicians of the last regime who used to whistle past helpless ?others? to their unknown destinations, official or otherwise, may be absent today - yet the absolute indiscipline of the subject people is no less than it was during any time. This unadulterated road-rowdiness is in display wherever one chooses to travel - an incredible agony for the onlooker and an excruciating wait-and-run for the motorist. All those who use our roads suffer a collective suffocation of life, commute and everything else that really matters in day-to-day existence. But the inconceivable human stories that surround all those who use our roads, the traffic and other outfits of travelling, are never told in full mournful detail. So I decided to make an attempt - with my own humble pen.?
The mass of commuters waiting at bus stops, hundreds of schoolchildren in their own personal hordes chatting and joking about the various goings-on in their respective classes, a Buddhist monk hurrying back to his temple before dark; some in three-wheelers, some in four-wheelers and yet others treading the good earth, for they are not fortunate, or yet unfortunate, to use mo-bikes, and other commuting gear that populate our narrow streets of urban and suburban Colombo.?
Their needs, their wants, their weeping and laughter, their comings and goings, their daily struggle to put food on the table for their families, all these and more make an integral part of the glorious mosaic of life. Its splendour, its lamentation, its begrudging complaints and its magnificent celebrations, its snail-paced drag and its nauseating speed and its waits and insufferable disappointments and its hidden jealousies and hatreds, its wicked motives and cruel executions, all these play an enormous role in a man?s day, whether he travels by bus, three-wheeler, mo-bike or on foot, the core does not change. Deep inside that core resides humanity?s essentials, its values and those values? validity and vitality. This great human drama is being played around every corner of this globe. Not only in Colombo, not only in other urban cities, not only in the great suburbs. It?s being enacted in the remotest hamlets and villages.?
Among those commuters are found boyfriend-girlfriend tales which include, among others, the nagging of the girlfriend for a quick marriage while the boy is looking for some fun and extraction of lust until he decides it?s time to marry or part; in this midst are found parents of an ailing child rushing from one specialist to another in a three-wheeler while putting away the thought of repaying the loan that they received form the neighbor to trek to Colombo in search of a miracle treatment for their child?s cruel illness.?
The devoted school teacher whose age is as hidden behind her well-groomed hairstyle and closely-knit jacket as an ageless peacock and attired in an elegant Kandyan sari having secured a transfer from a distant district to her home district by courtesy of the Education Department and couldn?t lose time to tell her disabled-soldier husband, rented a four-wheel taxi to rush home. Her taxi too is stuck in the twilight-traffic-gridlock in the city. Life in all its wonders is in display. How each one is facing hardship and new challenges and overcomes them or gets drowned in treacherous flurry of combined ill-luck is just how one would look at life. The gram seller who occupied most of the daytime on Galle face green has made his day?s collection target and is content with his day?s achievement. He is heading towards the closest liquor seller to warm up for the night. His young and buxom wife is eagerly waiting at the shanty-dwelling located in a not-so-rosy corner of the city to discover that her husband and she could afford to have another child with the increasing sales during last few months.?
Life full of expectations and despair, lows and highs, bravery and timidity and love and hate, is playing its unpredictable drama on an unpoetic tone on a rush-hour street in the capital city of Colombo. Those who travel in 5-series Mercedes are travelling home eager to get back home, change and head for a cocktail party at which he is expecting to meet a Minister in charge of a special project and probably close the deal of a government tender. But he will have to wait in traffic too.
Rush-hour jam is a great equalizer and means to favour no one, whether travelling by a Mercedes or a three-wheeler. The young housewife who has recently secured a promotion and by way of that promotion has qualified for company transport in Maruti car is also among this frustrated populace on road. She will definitely be late to get home and her husband who is a young lecturer at the university must be frustrated too, for he is hungry.?
In this unfriendly carnival of life, traffic jams play a very decisive part in defining and shaping the clown-character and core of those who are willy nilly taking part in this wild drama. There is no room for poetic justice; there is no space for forgiving souls; there is no easy way out for shortcut-oriented wheeler-dealers. Those who understand how clumsy ?our traffic-management is on road and the powers that be would be wise enough to wait for a brighter day to dawn which would also usher in an orderly way of driving, walking and general road-discipline which the average Sri Lankan has no clue about. No political party, no Inspector General of Police or DIG in charge of Traffic or for that matter, Commissioner General of Motor Traffic has paid sufficient attention, nor have they diagnosed the real cause of these innumerable traffic jams that cause endless streams of frustration and sighs by the users of our roads. A people whose fundamental faith in self-discipline has broken down beyond any redemption, a people whose characteristically natural disregard for law and order, a people who do not understand that the next door neighbour too has the same right the other has, a people who have been hoodwinked over five to six decades by power-hungry political leaders, a people whose religious leaders are as apathetic to socio-economic changes that sweep the world as a they could ever be, would not come to grips with an endemic situation which, if not curbed and controlled now, would end up choking our capital City to virtual death.
?
In the total absence of a sophisticated, empathetic and cultured approach to modern-day issues, any efforts at Band-Aid solutions would all fail. And ironically, it would be our children who will have to pay an unbelievable price for a generation or two. Chaos cannot be eliminated by standing still while everything is falling apart. That is precisely what this generation of ours has been doing- mass-impotency in the face of grave challenges and demands.?
A generation whose brains have been dulled by an archaic education system, a generation that has been shown an untold number of mirages, a generation that has been rotting away in a ?comfort zone? of political promises and economic emptiness may find it extremely hard to reconcile clashing value systems. Social scientists have so far made attempts only at paying ?pooja? to powers that be. In Les Mis?rables, Victor Hugo says thus:?Teach the ignorant as much as you can; society is culpable in not providing a free education for all and it must answer for the night which it produces. If the soul is left in darkness sins will be committed. The guilty one is not he who commits the sin, but he who causes the darkness?. In our case, it is those who are in charge of policy who have committed a bigger sin.?

BITTER OR  BETTER
	
A gazette notification announcing price celling for 48 medicinal drugs was issued last month by the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA). Accordingly prices of drugs sold above the Gazetted maximum retail price should be reduced, while drugs sold below the maximum retail price could not be increased.
The maximum retail price is imposed on 48 medicines including medicines for diabetes, high blood pressure, cardio vascular diseases, asthma and arthritis. Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne took this initiative claiming he was following Prof. Senaka Bibile?s essential drugs policy, which has been hailed worldwide. However, certain groups say Dr. Senaratne?s claim was dubious as he had not followed the basics of Bibile?s policy, which is to make quality drugs available at affordable prices
CIF not applicable
Responding to the concerns raised by doctors, Prof. Asita de Silva, the Chairman of the National Medicine Regulatory Authority (NMRA) said that anybody was entitled to his or her opinion. ?Prof. Senaka Bibile wanted to bring everything under State control and make everything available at a low cost. He didn?t want private companies to function. This was during period when Sri Lanka had a closed economy. There was no Cost Insurance Freight (CIF) mark up as far as I know.? ?The CIF price is given by the pharmaceutical importer. There is no way we can verify whether that is the actual CIF price because Sri Lanka Customs does not verify it. ?For vehicles we could get a price verification, but this is not done for medicines. As a result we depend on the CIF price given by the importers. ?A World Health Organisation (WHO) expert who came to Sri Lanka this year did an extensive study on the pharmaceutical pricing structure.
?This report shows that the CIF price is non-verifiable and as a result we should not go down that road. Another publication by the WHO in 2015--which is a guideline for countries to regulate pharmaceutical pricing- -also states that the CIF model will not work well in low and middle income countries. ?We decided not to follow this model after careful thought, going through reports by global experts and also with the experiences we have with pharmaceutical importing,? he said. He added that the Chamber of Pharmaceutical Industry and major colleges such as the Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA), College of Physicians, Pediatricians, Surgeons and Neurologists were consulted and that they had endorsed the move away from the CIF pricing.
?The NMRA Act was brought in last year. It looks at quality, efficacy, safety as well as the needs and cost. As for quality assurance we do have challenges. But there is a stringent process to follow. Whatever drug that is registered under the NMRA is quality assured.? Adding that Sri Lanka was not the only country that uses generics he said that thirty percent of medicines in Britain and upto 40 percent in the United States are generics. ?A majority of them are supplied by India. But they go through a stringent quality assurance process. Some people say that the NMRA is inefficient because it takes around eight months to register a product. But this is because we go through a stringent process to assure quality. We also have our national medical quality assurance laboratory. One of our priorities is to strengthen this laboratory and we have also asked for a new laboratory to be set up. Then we will be even more confident about quality assurance.? He also said that the NMRA was implementing a procedure to restrict the number of brands of the same type of medicine being imported to the country. Stating that the NMRA was responsible for monitoring the pharmacies and pricing he said they had food and drug inspectors. ?We have a hotline (828) in the Ministry of Health. The number of complaints has dropped dramatically in the last few days.
Only the first step
In media reports Health Minister Dr. Senaratne has repeatedly said that last month?s maximum retail price system was only the first step towards implementing the Senaka Bibile Policy on providing quality healthcare to all people at affordable prices and restoring a health service, where the wellbeing of the patients is given priority. He says for decades after 1976, when the then Government was forced to scrap the Bibile?s Policy little or nothing had been done to provide quality drugs at affordable prices. A comprehensive draft of the National Medicinal Drug Policy had been approved by the Cabinet as far back as October 2005 but it had been going here and there till the national government approved the legislation in March last year. Three months later the NMRA was appointed and it was able to begin work by about November last year.
But even by August this year the prices of drugs had not been reduced or the imports restricted. Therefore he had invited Prof. Asita de Silva to take control of the NMRA and introduce a price reduction urgently. He says last month?s reduction of prices is only a first step and more price reduction will be announced soon, while China will help to set up a hi-tech quality assurance laboratory. Dr. Senaratne also says that from next year the Government hopes to sign agreements for about 25 publicprivate partnership companies so that 70 percent of the drugs now being imported could be produced locally with the prices being drastically reduced
Doctors differ on generics & brands
?While we appreciate the benefits of cheaper drugs to the health and welfare of our people, we have to be cautious about the implementation of price control. There may be a tendency to bring in the cheapest drug, irrespective of quality, and that drug could be less effective. This could be life threatening in the case of an infection,? said Dr. Enoka Corea, a Consultant Microbiologist ?Doctors differ in opinions about prescribing generic and branded drugs. While good generic drugs are equally effective and usually much cheaper, some doctors prefer to prescribe branded drugs because they feel that they are internationally recognized and are more effective and reliable,? she added.
Efficacies differ
?The drugs that are under this policy are drugs from Western countries, which are drugs that are not affordable to the average person or a poor person as they would choose the Indian brands instead. Because of their expensive nature the profit margin from these drugs, prior to the implementation of this policy, was very high. Now that pharmacies are forced to reduce the prices, the profit margin also has become narrow, resulting in the pharmacies to stop the supply of these drugs,? said a doctor who did not want to be named.
?People who would buy these drugs will find it difficult to cope as they would have to switch to the less effective counterparts. Switching brands does not have any drastic consequences, the only consequence would be that the patient would have to increase their dose. The drugs that are under the price control policy are mostly drugs for diabetes, cholesterol, high blood pressure etc. Therefore stepping up on the dose does not have any bad consequences as such. At the end of the day it?s the same drug just with different levels of effectiveness,? he added. ?When patients come to me they usually ask me to recommend the cheapest brand and I prescribe a brand depending on their financial status,? the doctor said.
Quality is important
The Government hospitals can get down drugs at a lower cost. But the Ministry of Health needs to maintain the quality and the standard of the drug. The type of brand a patient uses depends on the patient?s financial status. If low quality drugs are brought in then, due to their low effectiveness patients will be coming in to the hospital more frequently resulting in overcrowding of the wards. ?The aim of a Government hospital is to get patients out of the hospital faster. Therefore, good quality drugs are necessary,? said a doctor who works at the General Hospital and did not want to be named.
Started on the wrong foot
sking for an appointment because we see some serious errors in the new Gazette notice and even in the NMRA Act,? said Dr. Haritha Aluthge, the Assistant Secretary of the GMOA. Dr. Aluthge raised concern about the sustainability of the maximum retail price system. ?Through the recent Gazette notification they have imposed maximum prices for certain drugs. But will it be sustainable with the fluctuation of the dollar value and import taxes, which are important when a price is marked? The Ministry will have to revisit it every one or two years, and we don?t know what may happen next,? he said. ?In the new Gazette notice authorized officers responsible to monitor these changes are not clearly defined. We see that the Ministry is attempting to give the power to monitor the price control to additional officers like Public Health Inspectors (PHIs) and Inquiring Officers. When it comes to Inquiring Officers they don?t have the capacity to look into technical matters such as medicinal terms.
They are not trained in Pharmacy. Therefore we see that they are not suitable people to go into the field of authorization of pricing formulas. So, first of all the Ministry should define who the authorized officers are and issue a Gazette notification. The new drug Act clearly mentions that they should Gazette the authorized officers and give the Director General powers over them,? he said. Referring to the lack of a reliable quality assurance laboratory he said that they had repeatedly asked the Ministry to establish one. ?He has informed us that it would take around two years. They are currently discussing it with the Chinese government who will give aid to build a sophisticated lab. Quality laboratory assurance should be given priority because doctors depend on the quality of the product and not so much the price when prescribing drugs. If you have a drug which is cheaper but lacking in quality, ultimately patients suffer.? When asked if the Health Minister was following Prof. Senaka Bible?s policy he said they had doubts. ?In Prof. Bibile?s concept it is clearly stated that we should first have an essential drug list and update it annually. It?s not necessary for a country to have 30 to 40 companies or brands importing hundreds of brands-a shortlist of five or ten brands essential to the country. ?We hope to discuss with the Minister and try to help him succeed,? he added.
Only a pricing policy, not drug policy
?There are nine aspects for a drug policy which include pricing, quality assurance, distribution, and storage. But Dr. Senaratne has merely introduced a drug pricing method. This is only one aspect and even this is not compatible with Prof. Bibile?s policy. So, it is wrong for the Minister and the Ministry to claim they are following Prof. Bibile?s policy. There is a battle of ideas here. Dr. Senaratne seems to be misleading the people,? said Dr. Jayantha Bandara, National Organizer of the Prof. Senaka Bibile?s Commemorative Association and Secretary of All Ceylon Medical Officers? Union. ?Prof. Bibile introduced a pricing system based on the Cost Insurance Freight value (CIF value). CIF refers to the prices of drugs before taxed or before they come to ports. In other words, the import price. For instance, according to the Bibile?s policy the maximum retail price would be Rs. 165 for drugs imported at Rs. 100. Rs.65 would be the profit distributed among the importer, dealer and retailers. ?But Dr. Senaratne?s policy is not based on the CIF value. In fact he is totally against the CIF value,? added Dr. Bandara. He said that Prof. Bibile was opposed to brand names and wanted to reduce the number of brands.
?However, there are no restrictions to brands in Dr. Senaratne?s policy. Some drugs are being imported under about 30 brand names. There are so many brands and the price range is wide. For example, the price of the SPC drug Acyclovir which is a generic drug for chicken pox is around Rs. 6.00. Zovirax which is a brand of the same drug sold at around Rs.140 for a 200 mg tablet,? he added. Reiterating the grievance of many doctors Dr. Bandara said that there was no quality assurance for drugs both in the public and the private sector. ?We inquired from the Health Minister about this issue and he informed us the State laboratories were inadequate to provide quality assurances for most drugs,? said Dr. Bandara. ?Prof. Bibile?s policy also focused on the availability of drugs in the Public Sector. Drugs should be available at all times in correct doses and in adequate amounts. However, in Dr. S e n a r a t n e ?s policy little is mentioned about the availability of a drug in the Public Sector. Drug availability in Sri Lanka is very poor at the moment,? he added. ?Our aim is to reduce drug prices. But we have not achieved that target through this pricing method. People still suffer,? he said.

Death of four heart patients: Cause could be allergy, says Minister
	
Cabinet Spokesman and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said today that the Cardiologists had suspected the cause of death of four patients could be an allergic reaction to a dye given to patients during the surgery and stopped the usage of the dye.
While addressing media at the weekly Cabinet briefing at the Parliament Complex he said the hospital doctors had immediately stopped the usage of the dye and had started a special investigation into the incident,? the Minister said.
?A three member committee had been appointed to investigate the deaths and submit a report today under the directions of the Director of Health Services Dr. Palitha Mahipala,? he said.
Four patients who underwent heart surgery at the Colombo National Hospital died following heart surgeries on Monday.
?I informed the hospital director to hand over an investigation report as soon as possible. Most of the medicine were brought into the country in batches because they were imported after tenders. There are several batches that cause problems. Those batches were withdrawn immediately,? he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Fighting shy of Diyawanna council?
	
?
A young Diyawanna member has established a new record for high absenteeism from the council.
?
A member of a political family and a fluent orator, the young Diyawanna is a big one in a small party.?
This member who worked hard towards the victory of yahapalanaya, once during a visit to the deep South bragged that he could defeat even the former strongman at the latter?s home turf at an election.
Some people musing about the truant Diyawanna member wonder whether he has assumed that there is no harm in his being absent from the council as long as the other member keeps the family flag flying!

Foreign boats straying into SL territory to be fined upto Rs 17 crore
	
In a troubling news for Indian fishermen, Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources development, Sri Lanka has announced a hefty penalty for foreign boats straying into Sri Lankan territory.
Foreign boats straying into Sri Lankan territory without permission will be harshly fined up to 17 crore. Singling out the violation, now becoming a subject of worry, the Minister Mahinda Amaraweera has announced this decision.
Mahinda Amaraweera said that local fishermen have been facing a lot of trouble because of foreign fishermen illegally entering the Sri Lankan territory.
Amaraweera also said that fine on foreign boats will range from Rs 30 lakh to Rs 17 crore. The current law will be amended to incorporate this clause, Mahinda said.
Till date, Sri Lankan Navy has taken trespassers, their boats and their fishing equipments in custody but never fined anyone. However, now the boats seized will be returned when the owner comes to retrieve the boats from Sri Lanka, Mahinda confirmed.
The situation has been tense between the fishermen of both the countries over Katchatheevu issue and their rights to fish in the Indian Ocean.
Indian fishermen who have been constantly facing the threat of arrest by the Sri Lankan Navy have approached the State and Central government for intervention and aide.
The only time the Indian fishermen are allowed to Katchatheevu is during the festival at St Antony's shrine there.(India Today)

Hatton Barber claims police tortured him
	
Kadireshan Ravishankar, a 34-year-old barber and father of four, alleges he was tortured by the Hatton HQI (Headquarters Inspector) on September 23. He was working at his brother, Kadireshan Simson? salon - ?CS Saloon? - when he was called to give a haircut to the Hatton HQI. Grappling with abject poverty, Ravishankar has now been forced to battle against the added burden of social stigma after surviving police torture.?
?At around 7.00 p.m., two police officers in plain attire came to our salon and asked me to come with them to trim the hair of the Hatton HQI,? said Ravishankar. However, he has refused to go on the errand as his employer (brother) was absent and also as there were customers who had been waiting for a longtime.?
?But I told them I would come once the salon closed for the day. Yet, they threatened that I would not be able to open the salon the next day. They left after intimidating me,? he added.?
?
?
According to Ravishankar, the police officers had returned with back-up officers at 7.30 p.m. and threatened him again. He alleged that the police officers who included two Sub-Inspectors forced him to go to the police station.?
?As I had no other choice, I asked the two customers left behind to wait for my brother. Then I went with the police officers,? he said.?
A terrible fate awaited him at the police station. He alleges that he?was tortured.?
?The HQI addressed me derogatorily and yelled at me inhumanly. He asked me very arrogantly as to why I had refused to arrive initially. I explained to him the reason and I apologized. But the HQI grabbed me by my right arm, which he twisted and held on my back. He punched me five times on my back with his elbow. He didn?t stop at that. He punched on my face and kicked me as well. It hurt very much and I still suffer in pain,? wept Ravishankar. Thereafter, police officers had asked him to contact his brother. He has informed his brother of the plight he had undergone.?
?
?
Ravishankar had then, taking his equipment, run out of a door that was ajar, to his salon situated half a kilometre from the police station.?
?My brother and two customers were at the salon. And outside, there were many people looking at me flabbergasted, wondering what had happened,? said Ravishankar. He had requested his brother to admit him to the Dikoya ?Base Hospital as he was injured.?
?At the hospital, an ASP and another police officer asked me to get discharged. I refused because I was in extreme pain. They tried forcing me to sign the discharge form but I didn?t. They also asked my brother to convince me to get discharged. After that, the ASP came again with more than 15 officers. None of them was in uniform,? added Ravishankar.?
?On the 24th, I gave a statement to the Hospital Police. That evening, an ASP from the Nuwara Eliya Police station recorded a statement from me. On the 25th, two Sub-Inspectors from the Hatton Police asked me about the two customers who were in the salon when I returned after being tortured. But I didn?t reveal their identities for their safety,? he said.?
Ravishankar had been discharged from the hospital on September 26. However, as he had not fully recovered, he had been admitted to the Nawalapitiya ?Hospital for a few days. Ravishankar is still recovering from his injuries. ?Police officers still follow me. I feel so ashamed when people look at me. My three children who are schooling are questioned in school as to what happened to their father. My youngest child is four and a half years old. My record of being tortured by the police will be a problem when we need to admit the child to school in future,? said Ravishankar.?
?The HQI who tortured me wasn?t penalized. He was merely transferred to the Nuwara Eliya Police station,? he further said.?
Kandy Human Rights Office Director Fr. Nandana Manathunga said a protest was held the very next day after the torture in Hatton, requesting the IGP to take action against the alleged perpetrator. As a result, the HQI had been transferred to the Nuwara Eliya Police station. Thereafter, he had been transferred to the Batticaloa Police station where he currently functions.?
A Police officer attached to the Hatton Police station said the inquiry was conducted by the Nuwara Eliya Police station.?
?Legally, we?re not allowed to conduct an inquiry as all allegations are against this police station. So the Nuwara Eliya Police station was given the responsibility and they conducted the inquiry which is complete now. But we?re not aware of the results,? the police officer said.?
When we contacted the Nuwara Eliya Police station, its officers confirmed that the inquiry was complete and the HQI was transferred to their police station. ?
?The inquiry was conducted by ASP Dasanayake. However, there will be further disciplinary investigation,? he said.?
District ASP Dasanayake said information pertaining to the inquiry could not be revealed to the media. ?I conducted the inquiry and statements were collected. But I can?t divulge the result of the inquiry because internal officers are involved,? he said.?
?
Stigma attached to torture victims?
?Torture victims are not usually supported by civil society members as police accuse them with fabricated charges to justify torture. As a result, people believe the police, thus condemning the victims of torture,? Fr. Nandana Manathunga said.?
?People are also afraid of associating or assisting torture victims, fearing that police would target them as well. There have been instances where people who assisted torture victims by providing security or giving evidence, were later arrested with fabricated charges such as keeping drugs in their possession. Hence, due to their vulnerability, torture victims give up the fight in seeking justice. Some have even fled the country,? he added.?

JO wants Govt. to probe Nilwala Project
	
The Joint Opposition (JO) today requested the government to probe into the President?s statement made in Galle that a whopping Rs. 3,012 million allocated for the Nilwala River Development Project going missing just a day before the last Presidential Election.
Addressing a Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) membership drive campaign held in Galle on Saturday, President Maithripala Sirisena said that Rs. 1,000 million had been issued by the Finance Ministry for the project in 2012 and the Treasury had issued a cheque for Rs.3,012 million to the Irrigation Ministry Secretary in January 7, 2015.
The fate of the total amount of Rs. 4,012 million was a mystery, President Sirisena said.
Responding to the remarks of the President, Matara District JO MP Dullas Alahapperuma said all ministers who are responsible for the project were in the current government and as such the government should probe into the statement.
?It was President Maithripala Sirisena who was the Mahawali Development Minister when the agreement was signed for the project with a China based Company. Irrigation Minister during the said time was Nimal Siripala de Silva who is the current Transport Minister. Therefore, it is up to the government to probe these remarks and clarify as to what has happened,? he told a news conference. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Prosperous Capital penetrates into urban, rural low-income customer segments
	
Microfinance has undergone a significant transformation in recent years. The steadily growing popularity of microfinance has reached a global audience and continues to be a key facilitator in helping to fight poverty in both developing and developed countries.
The world development indicators from the World Bank report states that over 23 percent of the Sri Lankan population is living below the poverty line. To address this concern, Prosperous Capital Ltd (PCA Ltd) has taken the initiative to penetrate into urban and rural low-income customer segments and provide financial solutions to uplift their income level living and standards.?
Its strategically placed branch network into untapped rural areas in Sri Lanka has awakened customer segments that have never been exposed to microfinance in the past. Currently, operating in 11 branches, PCA Ltd is strategically placed to cover locations islandwide and plans are also in place to expand by opening another 15 branches in the near future. PCA Ltd takes responsibility for creating wider benefits both within and around the business and endeavours to make a positive impact, which improves people?s livelihoods while protecting the environment.
The company believes in improving the lives of its clients and that improvement can come only when the right kind of social initiatives are put in place. Therefore, PCA Ltd has introduced a host of supportive social initiatives, which includes entrepreneurship development, healthcare initiatives, environment protection and conversation, empowerment of community and ethics and values.?
As a company following the triple bottom line concept, the goal is to maintain financial, social and environment performance through sustainable development. Hence, the company vision ?to create an opportunity for the rural people of Sri Lanka to achieve a life free from poverty, with dignity and purpose?.
The microfinance sector in Sri Lanka has become very dynamic and organisations increasingly face new challenges that include fierce competition, demand for diversified products and most selective customers. As a result, microfinance providers face rising client dropout rates and sometimes low acquisition rates.?
PCA Ltd considers the most important function in microfinance to be increasing a customer-centric culture that strengthens the ties between the organisation and the customer in numerous ways, including finding the right customers, which helps to grow the customer base as the company expands into new markets and work with new customer segments. Awareness creation programmes also help to achieve the social missions by making sure low-income clients are aware of the services available.?
Microfinance service providers in Sri Lanka typically face four challenges, which can be easily addressed. These are poor awareness, poor understanding, low activation rates and low retention rates. PCA LTD has taken the responsibility to identify these problems facing the microfinance industry and in turn designed and executed appropriate strategies to respond and track results.?
The Micro Finance Act No.6 of 2016, passed by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka this year, will help to regulate the microfinance industry in Sri Lanka. Attention is also given to working with respect to corporate social responsibility based on the fundamental values and principles set out in the UN?s Global Compact, while strictly following the international labour law standards.
The company has a good reputation in the microfinance industry among both customers and stakeholders. This is mainly due to instant recognition, differentiation, reliability, word of mouth and goodwill. We believe that we have a duty to educate the entrepreneurs to facilitate their development and ensure that they have adequate knowledge to make informed choices. The projects focus on the key areas that entrepreneurs must address in taking products to the market, providing insights to avoiding common pitfalls and financial literacy.?
PCA Ltd is the only ISO-certified microfinance company in Sri Lanka. The company has won several important business awards recognising the dedicated efforts towards the microfinance sector in Sri Lanka, of which the most notable awards being Global Banking & Finance Review Awards 2015, International Finance magazine review awards 2015 and the Asia Responsible Entrepreneur Award 2016. Prof. Prasanna Perera, a Professor in Economics, having received numerous awards including the Commonwealth Doctoral Scholarship, Kodikara Award, serves as Non-Executive Independent Director of the company. Prof. Prasanna has been associated with the company since its inception as promoter taking responsibility for the strategic direction and guidance of the company.?
Madhawa Edussuriya is an Executive Director of PCA Ltd being the founder consultant and chief strategist of the company leading the company to obtain ISO 9001:2008 certification for the operational quality of the company by SGS ? UK, which is believed to be the first ISO certified micro credit provider in Sri Lanka. He holds an MBA from the Australian Institute of Business (AIB) 2013, MSC in Strategic Marketing from Asia E University, Malaysia (2011) and a Diploma in Business Management from Indian Institute of Business and Technology.

Regional Development Bank celebrates 31st anniversary
	
Regional Development Bank (RDB) from its inception in 1985 to empower the self-sufficient Sri Lankans celebrated its 31st anniversary this year. Passing numerous milestones along its journey and generating more than Rs.100 billion in assets for the Sri Lankan economy, the bank has achieved massive progress while uplifting the lifestyles of the people. With over 3000 dedicated employees and an islandwide branch network of 268, RDB caters to a clientele that exceeds over six million.?
In the RDB history, a significant triumph was achieved by increasing the convenience of easy banking via an ATM network of over 2500 ATM machines located at every corner of the island. The main objective behind this endeavour is to uplift the lives of villagers in rural areas and towards that end the bank has launched several projects with special benefits. Therefore, the bank has taken steps to provide financial support at a low interest to several projects.
RDB has introduced strategically planned loan schemes in order to bring the benefits of these projects to the people. Therefore, entrepreneurial individuals can select a financial scheme that suits their needs. Under this facility, financial aid is given to agriculture, animal husbandry, fishing industries, business expansions, small-medium entrepreneurs and microfinance.
In addition to these loan schemes, the bank has taken measures to attract and encourage customers to save by introducing saving schemes with special benefits that cater to various age groups.
When it comes to the agriculture sector in Sri Lanka, RDB is one of its biggest loan providers. The bank provides practical solutions to farmers to sell their seeds at a good price. The World Bank through the government of Sri Lanka established mega stores in Galenbidunuwewa and Buththala to help farmers to store their crops till they get a good price and the bank had distributed guaranteed seeds to farmers to get a better yield. Although it was a World Bank project, it was RDB that handled the administration part of this project.
Furthermore, the success of any financial system depends on the satisfaction of the real wants and needs of all communities who utilize the financial facilities provided by the said financial system productively. Based on this theory, RDB has introduced a wide range of savings products suitable for every age group, suiting their needs and specially formulated to attract rural people with low income and guide them towards methodical and long-term savings.?
The RDB ?Kekulu? children?s savings account has a high interest rate and provides a range of attractive gifts scholarships. The RDB ?Yovun? account has been introduced for teenagers from ages 12 to 18 years. Opportunities have been provided for them to obtain RDB Sinhala - English dictionaries to help in their education and a range of valuable gifts through this account.
?
The RDB ?Liya Saviya? investment savings account has been introduced to secure the tomorrows of women. Through this savings account empowering women of courage, their savings will get the highest interest and they will be able to obtain financial facilities for their income-generating projects.
The bank has plans to expand its branch network to provide convenient and comfortable service to their customers further more and the bank will continue to provide innovative products that would be an asset in saving your hard-earned money.

Relying more on brawns than on brains
	
?
There is a longstanding feud between a top team member from the Uva and a young Diyawanna member hailing from the same area.?
?
The duo had been involved in a series of disputes over the years and their latest bone of contention was an Uma- oya-related issue. The young member had been boiling with anger when he had come face to face with the top team member in the House lobby.?
The young member had demanded an explanation from the top team member for taking the initiative to hold an official meeting in his area without informing him in advance. The top team member was about to turn his back on his antagonist saying: ?Take it up at an appropriate time and place and not now!?, when the latter aimed a hard blow at him and a fight had ensued. Several Diyawanna members who were at the scene had with the greatest difficulty pulled the two combatants apart.
One of two, in a feeble attempt at covering up his shameful conduct had later told the media that his antagonist got a severe beating in this incident. However, those who are in the know of this incident say that both fighting cocks do not seem to have realized that through their unbecoming conduct, they had brought dishonor to the august assembly and on themselves.

Seylan Bank introduces mobile app; relaunches Internet banking platform
	
Seylan Bank has continually reiterated its leadership in the digital and social media fronts by understanding the customers? needs and introducing innovativeness. The bank recently relaunched its retail Internet banking portal and its mobile banking app with new features beneficial for its customers. Seylan Bank Senior Deputy General Manager Operations Nimal Tillekeratne speaks about the bank?s initiatives on the digital front.
What steps has the bank taken internally in its systems to cater to the needs of tech-driven customers?
It begins with the vision of the bank as far as the electronic channels are concerned. The bank is deliberately and dedicatedly trying to bring self-service convenience to its customers in banking transactions. One avenue we see is empowering them in the Internet banking options more and more so that people need not physically come to the branches to do the routine transactions. We pioneered the Internet banking facility in 2001. Initially, I think just as many other banks, we didn?t grasp the real future and potential around digital banking. The main idea back then was to keep the customers away from queuing in front of the counters. Later on, between 2008 and 2010, banks started looking to Internet banking as a tool to empower customers and to get the customers to self-service channels.?
This realization came late as most of us were used to the brick and mortar banking systems and preferred having the customers at the branches and having a casual chat as the preferred way of cross selling. The customer behaviour is such today, they want things done as fast as possible and they want most of services at their fingertips. They are not even interested in the desktop versions of Internet banking anymore, but prefer the tabs and mobile apps. Internet banking is not something which we can introduce without backend support. Hence, we have invested heavily in backend technology to offer a best-in-class Internet application to our valued customers.
What are the new features of the relaunched Internet banking platform and mobile app?
With the earlier Internet banking portal, we required the customers to come to the branch to open subsequent accounts. With the new facility, customers can create their own savings and fixed deposit accounts online. That is one significant step towards our promise of customer convenience. Also, customers can apply/obtain loans and disburse through their current/savings accounts themselves and create payment schedules, instant transfers within or to other banks on their own. We will also have the capability to deliver ?cash just in time? feature very soon. That being said, even with the new add-ons, I still feel there is more room to develop.
How does the app/Internet banking add value to one?s daily routine?
Our Internet banking facility and the app work 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We are the first bank to accept cash through CDM (cash deposit machine) 24x7 as well. We have a contact centre which attends to any issues related to Internet banking. The most common problem faced by customers is forgetting passwords. When you realized you cannot remember the password, when you want to make a payment, it could be a very bad feeling. Our call centre is geared to immediately reactivate the account securely in no time. Also, the customers can pay their utility bills, schedule transfers and pay their credit card bills through our Internet banking system and mobile app.
What are the unique features of the Seylan app that differentiates it from other banks? apps?
The ability to create one?s own loan account is a unique feature we have. We will also introduce online self on boarding capability very soon, keeping all regulatory requirements in mind.
How secure is Internet banking and mobile app?
We practise two factor authentications that secure the user against identity theft: by triggering one-time passwords for transactions over a particular limit and for self-administration options.
How is the compatibility of the app and Internet banking facility in different devices and operating systems?
Internet banking can be accessed through Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Opera and Safari. The app is compatible with Android and iOS but not yet with Windows. We are working on this and look forward to making it available via Windows as well. Customers can visit the App/Play stores and download the app without any hassle.
What are the future plans on the digital front for the bank?
We have a very high focus as to what and where we want to be in the digital banking universe.
Apart from the retail Internet banking product, we have a corporate digital channel that offers options like any other bank. New basic additions would be the customs payments, EPF and other government payments.
However, we want to bring out something very versatile but simple to use application to which will be a game changer in this sphere. In this effort, our focus would be SMEs because we see the next generation of the ownership of SMEs is highly educated with a vision for their business, obviously tech-savvy and wanting to make a name in their respective business fields. Recently, I went through a paper article describing the visioning of such a company wanting to be within the first 100 companies in Sri Lanka. This is indeed a great way of positioning your business. We developed the new version of our corporate Internet frontend having this new generation of such visionary companies in mind.
We want all our customers to be part of the relaunched retail Internet banking system. Some customers may feel it?s too technical but we would like to invite them to experience how easy and convenient its usage.?

They have decided that enough is enough
	
?
There are at least eight State purohitas from both main parties in yahapalanaya sulking over the fact that they have been reduced to nonentities in their respective Ministries.
?
As the representations they had made to the highest authorities time and again had fallen on deaf ears, the dejected ones had powwowed about their future plans at a hotel in Thalawathugoda and at this discussion most of them had shared the view that they should quit ? office if no immediate action was taken to assign them with their due share of powers and functions.?
As a warning of things to come, a state purohita from Polonnaruwa had handed his letter of resignation to the Number One in yahapalanaya. However, the Number One had refused to accept it saying: ?Don?t be impatient. We?ll sort out your problems in two or three weeks!??
One of those from Puttalam is adamant that he would quit office if the promise is not kept.?
?Among the state purohitas who have taken up a ?do or die? stance on this issue are the ones from Matale, Hambantota, Kegalle and Jaffna. By the way, the unhappy one from Matale is a very senior one and the politico from the North is a fair one, they say.
Most these unhappy ones feel that they can afford to press their demands hard, given the local polls round the corner.?

Touting to be banned at BIA
	
The government has decided to ban touting for transport, currency exchange and loading services at the arrival lobby and in the porch area of the Bandaranaike International Airport due to many difficulties being caused to passengers as well as Airport and Aviation Services officials.
Speaking at a Cabinet media briefing, co-spokesman Gayantha Karunatileke said today that a proposal had been made by Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, to amend Civil Aviation Act No. 14 of 2010, to stop the touting, as the prevailing law was insufficient.

Why Palestine, Cuba left out in President?s UN speech: JO
	
The Joint Opposition today questioned the non-emphasis on Palestine and Cuban issues in the recent address of President Maithripala Sirisena at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Joint Opposition MP Keheliya Rambukwella, who was speaking during the Committee Stage debate on the budget, said all Sri Lankan Heads of State in the past had mentioned the Cuban and Palestine issue but this position had been for the first time changed in the recent speech."We would like to know whether Sri Lanka had changed its stance on the Palestine and Cuban issues," he asked.
He said it was sad to see the Minister of Foreign Affairs leaving these matters out during his speech and speaking on scams that have taken place in the past.
"There is FCID, CID and the Bribery Commission to deal with such matters and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should not be worried about those," Rambukwella said. (Yohan Perera)
