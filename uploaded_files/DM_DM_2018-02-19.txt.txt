British man drives from northernmost pub in the world to the southernmost
	

London, (Hindustan Times), 18 Feb 2018 - A Briton has driven a sports car across 21 countries, starting at the most northerly pub in the world and ending at the most southerly, a media report said on Saturday. Ben Coombs, 38, from Plymouth in Devon, drove 20,000 miles across three continents from the Arctic Circle to the southernmost tip of Chile, reports the BBC. It took him seven months to complete the challenge.
Coombs described the final pub as a dive, but said its the journey that matters, not the destination. The idea for the adventure came while he was having a pint in a pub on Dartmoor, England. The journey started on the Norwegian island of Svalbard in an abandoned mining settlement called Pyramiden, which has a population of four. Coombs said finding the northernmost bar was an easy investigative process.
Pyramiden is less than 700 miles from the North Pole... the BBC quoted Coombs as saying. The towns old hotel - which happens to have a still-functioning bar.
From Pyramiden, Coombs drove his green 20-year-old TVR Chimaera, called Kermit, across Europe to Southampton from where the car was shipped to New York in August. He then travelled across the US before heading south to Mexico. The final destination was Puerto Williams in Tierra del Fuego Chile where Coombs arrived on February 12 and found the southernmost bar.

John Keells Properties retains bullish streak on real estate with new residential development
	
Architectural rendering of John Keells Holdings proposed development  TRI-ZEN
Connecting the dots between peace of mind, life in the city and liveable space, John Keells Properties announced the launch of TRI-ZEN, a new residential property on Union Place. These smart living spaces in the heart of Colombo are for women and men on the go in the city; a stones throw from its many business hubs, yet designed for comfort and style. The project is expected to be completed by 2023 and is currently open for sales.
John Keells Properties leads the charge on the property development and real estate sector in Sri Lanka, with a significant portfolio of real estate in Colombo and the suburbs. The companys most recent acquisition is a property on Vauxhall Street valued at Rs 4.2 Billion.
Recently the company led and successfully completed the design and construction of two landmark residential properties in Colombo-OnThree20 on Union Place and 7th Sense on Gregorys Road. It is also the property developer transforming Colombos cityscape with Cinnamon Life, the ongoing Integrated Resort bordering the Beira Lake.
TRI-ZEN is John Keells Properties newest project focusing on metropolitan spaces that cater to the needs of Colombos growing class of working elite. From Union Place, TRI-ZENs residents will have immediate access to the citys best hospitals, restaurants, schools, hotels, shopping malls and more. Moreover, its central location takes hours spent in traffic out of the equation-which means residents can luxuriate in the extra time freed up every day to spend time with family and friends.
TRI-ZENs apartments are based on smart design principles to maximize space and comfort, and this efficient design allows these apartments to be affordably priced. Common open spaces are a key design feature throughout the property; the perfect spaces for conversation, relaxation and contemplation. This project is designed for both solitude and company- stay in on a Sunday and enjoy the citys drowsy reverie, or go out on a Friday night to one of the many cafes, bistros and restaurants situated only minutes away.
TRI-ZEN meets and exceeds the expectations on location, style and comfort. When we designed this complex, we dedicated a lot of resources to understanding the market - to analyse customer needs and wants, noted Suresh Rajendra, President of the John Keells Property Group. He also added, Colombo is changing, and with it our clients lifestyles and tastes are changing. Were responding to this by really thinking about how we can redefine what it means to live well in Colombo. So this is an exciting project for us, as we strengthen our metropolitan property portfolio by creating eminently livable spaces for our clients.
For further information on the TRI-ZEN project, please contact the customer relations team on +94-112-000294 or email info@trizen.lk

Makeshift 'salon' at home destroys her marriage
	
An incident where a loss of a woman's hair also resulted in her calling off an intended marriage was reported recently from a village in close proximity to the up-country capitol.
The woman in question had gone to the middle-east for employment but had been convinced to return back home by her elder sister to get married by a proposal arranged by her. This was after working as a housemaid for three years.
The woman had arrived at her sisters house dreaming of meeting her Romeo and getting married before living happily ever after. Things however were about to go horribly wrong. One day, her two nieces, who had been bored, decided to get rid of their boredom by chopping off her long tresses using a pair of scissors while she was sound asleep.
After waking up to discover her lovely long hair, that she had taken a lot of trouble to grow, gone, the woman had become very self-consciousand stopped herself from leaving the house in the fear that someone might see her 'ugly' crop of hair. Another fall-out from this incident was that she had decided to give up the idea of getting married in the near future. (Dhammika Gunawardena)

President Maithripala Sirisena has the sole power to remove Prime Minister as the Constitution outlined the provision as to how a President could remove a Prime Minister, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman Prof. G.L. Peiris said today.
Addressing a news conference he said the constitution envisaged that the Prime Minister shall continue to hold office throughout the period during which the Cabinet of Ministers continues to function, and added as there seemed to be neither a government nor a cabinet right now, the President could remove the Prime Minister if required.
President Sirisena does not want to remove the premier although it is requisite to appoint a new Prime Minister. The President would delay it until the tenure of the incumbent Prime Minister expires. At the same time, the President is trying to delay appointing a new Prime Minister claiming that there are barriers that have been stipulated in the Constitution. By delaying it, the political necessity is neglected Prof. G.L said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Quick Tea Private Limited, a subsidiary of Sri Lankas largest Tea Exporter for over two decades  Akbar Brothers Limited, became the recipient of yet another accolade for the diversified group of companies by being certified as a CarbonConscious Company. The certification was awarded to Quick Tea by The Sustainable Future Group (SFG), committing the company to a three-year journey of measuring, managing, and mitigating their overall Carbon Footprint.
Certified CarbonConscious is part of a proprietary, diverse range of certifications developed by SFG following internationally accepted standards and protocols that overlook key environmental impact areas such as carbon, water, waste and biodiversity. Taking their standard of excellence one step further to ensure the companys environmental impact is managed as best as possible, Quick Tea partnered with the countrys foremost environmental consulting firm, The Carbon Consulting Company (CCC), to conduct detailed audits of the Companys operations to determine its current impact status and to identify areas for improvement. Recommendations were brainstormed with the newly introduced Green Team of Quick Tea and ideas were evaluated according to feasibility and alignment with the Companys corporate and sustainability goals and objectives, which were then incorporated into a comprehensive Carbon Management Plan with department-wise targets.
On receiving the certification, Shiraz Akbarally, Director at Akbar Brothers, commented, As a company that prides itself in innovative approaches and places high priority on ethical practices, we are always looking at ways to further expand our efforts in a more sustainable manner. Environmental performance is increasingly becoming a vital part of any business operation, and obtaining a green certification enables us to implement and maintain high standards in this area. Akbar Brothers are constantly beating the status quo, and this new accreditation reinforces our message to our clients and stakeholders that we are committed to a sustainable future. We would like to thank the CCC team for helping us embark on this exciting new journey that would no doubt prove beneficial in the long run.
We are encouraged to see Quick Tea join the ranks of responsible businesses taking the steps necessary towards growing sustainability in the corporate sector of Sri Lanka, remarked Sanith De S Wijeyeratne, CEO of CCC. It is truly admirable when a company not only understands the importance of protecting the environment, but takes action to reduce its impact. We hope other companies follow in their footsteps and join the global fight against Climate Change.
Incorporated in 1969, Akbar Brothers Limited have systematically diversified their business portfolio into Power Generation, Healthcare, Packaging, Banking, Insurance, Property Development and Environmental Services over the years, with Tea as the core business. Boasting a claim that over 75 million cups of Akbar Tea are consumed daily around the world, the company owes its success to maintaining the highest standards of quality and keeping to founding traditions such as ensuring that every consignment of Akbar Tea is personally approved by a family member before it is shipped.

Respecting boundaries and personal space
	
As Sri Lankans, we place less stress on the importance of personal space, possibly because of our collective culture and our emphasis on the importance of social ties. However, without understanding personal space and boundaries, we cannot tackle the myriad of problems that develop as a result of invading ones privacy and disregarding their consent. 
Respecting ones personal space includes understanding that each individual has their own boundaries defined by them and possibly unique to them. Consent of any kind requires a deep understanding that everyone deserves to be respected, regardless of whether we may understand their experience or not.These values shape individuals through an early process called socialisation, and they begins at home.
Through socialisation, young children and teenagers are exposed to the social norms and values that are present in their society. These norms and values are often deeply internalised and shape the way we view aspects of our society, like gender, family, and, education. Some norms can be so deeply rooted that it may be difficult to tolerate anything that does not fit in the boxes that we have created. These are then reinforced by daily interactions with family and peers. 
A prevalent reason for stigma and discrimination follows from the binary gender norms that exist in our society, these impose limitations on the types of behaviours that men, women or trans persons can perform. Women are expected to possess feminine qualities, and men, masculine qualities; a spill over of these qualities are seen as abnormal.
A woman with masculine qualities is seen as a threat, and a man with feminine qualities is seen as a deviation. Socially feminine traits are considered less, and a man displaying such behaviour is at risk for discrimination and abuse. Another harmful aspect of the stereotypical gender norms is the instigation of abuse and the tolerance of it with the failed impression of it being inherent to a true man or real woman. Men often take on a hyper masculine role which involves abusing women, and trans women, and often trans women misunderstand this for a validation of their gender.

"A prevalent reason for stigma and discrimination follows from the binary gender norms that exist in our society, these impose limitations on the types of behaviours that men, women or trans persons can perform. "
The suicide and attempted suicide rates among young LGBTIQ individuals remain dangerously high due to, school victimisation, harassment and social pressure to conform, resulting in the development of depression and other mental health problems that can be a life-long burden. Among the highly reported cases, Rahila, a transsexual woman, who has reported multiple suicide attempts, explained her abuse; she was sexually abused by her grandfather and her school-van driver at a young age. She also faced harassment in public transportation, when she tried to complain to the police multiple times her complaints were rejected. She faced workplace harassments and was abused by several other men during this time. Men and boys who are suspected of being feminine are called derogatory names and are treated differently.
Meanwhile, women who display masculine characteristics are deemed bossy and unattractive. This amounts to the sexism and homophobia that is evident in our society, who validated these values through institutions like schools, law enforcement, andhealthcare services.
The prevalent harassments such as bullying in schools are not just instigated by fellow classmates but can often be done by teachers themselves. As a result, students can feel isolated and targeted by the school and their classmates, making it harder for them to receive an education and receive opportunities to excel.

"Men and boys who are suspected of being feminine are called derogatory names and are treated differently. Meanwhile, women who display masculine characteristics are deemed bossy and unattractive. "
These individuals find themselves trapped in situations that continue to keep them rooted in difficult positions. In such a reported case Mahesh, a trans man was repeatedly harassed by his teachers, humiliating him in public. The teachers went as far as getting his parents involved in changing his expression repeatedly. This behaviour led to poor attendance at school and low grades in key examinations. Vindya, a lesbian reported how her teachers humiliated her with her classmates when they found out her affections for another girl. Educators play key roles in shaping young minds of not just the LGBTIQ community but of the general public at large. Early lessons in understanding boundaries and compassion can provide lifelong principles that help with eliminating arbitrary harassment and enriching the well-being of all citizens.
Understanding consent and respecting boundaries can provide a safe and welcoming environment for everyone involved. Respecting boundaries needs to be taught at an early age when children are still learning the norms and values of society. We can teach young people to acknowledge healthy boundaries and respect personal space, thereby creating a society where no one feels uncomfortable to say no and can expect their decision to be respected. It would create a society where bullying of any form will not be tolerated and instead create a culture that is ingrained with values of acceptance and an understanding of the value of diversity. The consequences of this have a positive impact, not just on the LGBTIQ community, but across communities. 
What is important to understand is that cultural norms are relative, they differ from culture to culture. But all cultures must cultivate universal respect for individual boundaries

Shame on you! student tells Trump at Florida anti-gun rally
	

A survivor of the Parkland school shooting called out US President Donald Trump on Saturday over his ties to the powerful National Rifle Association, as thousands rallied in Florida to demand urgent action on gun control. Three days after a troubled teen armed with an assault rifle killed 17 people, 18-year-old Emma Gonzalez delivered a fiery address to a crowd of students, parents and residents in nearby Ft. Lauderdale. 
To every politician taking donations from the NRA, shame on you! she thundered, assailing Trump over the multi-million-dollar support his campaign received from the gun lobby. The crowd chanted in turn: Shame on you! We are going to be the last mass shooting... We are going to change the law, she vowed -- slamming the fact 19-year-old gunman Nikolas Cruz was able to legally buy a semi-automatic firearm despite a history of troubling and violent behaviour. 
If the president wants to come up to me and tell me to my face that it was a terrible tragedy and... how nothing is going to be done about it, Im going to happily ask him how much money he received from the National Rifle Association, Gonzalez said in her impassioned address. It doesnt matter because I already know. Thirty million, she said.
FORT LAUDERDALE AFP Feb18, 2018 -

Trump blames FBI for Florida school shooting
US, (Daily Mail), 18 Feb 2018 -President Donald Trump said it was not acceptable that the FBI missed signs the Florida school shooter was going to attack, slamming the agency for spending too much time focusing on the Russian collusion investigation. 
After a week during which Robert Mueller appeared to prove Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, Trump used the shooting, in which 17 died, including 14 children, to attack the FBI for going after him in the Russian collusion investigation.

SLMC to support a stable Govt.
	
The Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) said today it would only support a stable government which commanded a comfortable majority in Parliament.
SLMC leader and Minister, Rauff Hakeem said the need of the hour was a stable government with a comfortable majority.
It is not advisable for anyone to form a minority government neither should there be a situation where one party directs another by way of a remote control," he said when recalling the political crisis that arose when he was removed from the Cabinet in 2001 and ended up in the opposition.
The minister urged the country's political leaders to form a stable government in line with the mandate they have received from the people.
The people may sense there is political crisis in the country if the leaders do not ensure stability," he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Technology is Eating the World
	
Mani Kulasooriya  Founder of Sysco LABS addressing the gathering
In a meeting with the American Chamber of commerce in Sri Lanka recently, Mani Kulasooriya - founder of Sysco LABS, and Ron May, Vice President of eSolutions at Sysco, addressed the audience with a presentation on the way that Technology is eating the World  an examination of the way that all industries are transforming to operate like the tech industry and how companies can react to this emerging trend. The following article summarizes key insights from their joint presentation.
Many of the major industries in the world have experienced upheaval due to tech companies entering their space. Ubers entry into the taxi industry, and Airbnbs entry into hospitality are some of the famous examples, along with Amazons disruption of how we think about retail. These tech companies have been successful by going beyond simply iterating upon the way industries run or innovation processes; they have used technology to completely disrupt the way that these industries serve their customers. In the case of Uber and Airbnb, by leveraging the sharing economy to overcome the barriers to these respective industries; and Amazon, by overcoming the need for brick and mortar storefronts through leveraging the online marketplace.
These disruptions have fueled both the growth of tech companies and their transformation. The largest companies in America in the previous decades were Oil and Energy companies, but in 2016, the trend shifted towards tech companies occupying the top five slots; Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook respectively. This growth was driven by a transformation within the tech companies themselves. In the late 90s, technology was a support function of organizations and more often than not, one that could be outsourced out of the organization if not out of the country, so many of the largest tech companies were BPOs. However, as technology continued to develop, the leading tech companies became those that specialized in creating technology to be used by consumers: The Apples, Microsofts and Googles of the world. But today, in the Silicon Valley, the leading tech companies are those that provide a more traditional product or service but with a superior customer experience driven by technology - Netflix, Amazon, Uber, etc.
Ron May  Vice President of e-Solutions, Sysco Corporation
This latest trend of superior customer experience through technology is growing fast as the latest innovations in technology allow tech to make a greater impact along the value chain. More obvious innovations such as the IoT (Internet of Things), robots, drones, automated cars, virtual assistants and employees, are driving change on the customer facing end of the value chain, while more invisible innovations like block chain technology - which drives crypto currencies and the big data produced through smart sensors and edge computing - transform value chains at their base. Together, what we are witnessing is an ever-growing influence of tech in business that will only allow tech companies to survive the future.
So, if you arent a tech company yourself, how do you react to this change Well, start operating like one. Lead like a founder - which is to say that you need to lead with the will to take large bold decisions the way that the founder of the company would. These decisions are the forces which will allow you to transform. Secondly, organize your company like a tech startup - with agility in mind. Small teams that own projects, move fast and are held accountable. Thirdly, hire techies and integrate them into you teams; this allows you to bring technology to every aspect of your organization and allows your teams to operate with entrepreneurial dexterity and independence.
Finally, to really operate like a tech company, you need to focus on the customer experience. The experience that your customer has with your product and your service, but also the experience your customer has through all their interactions with your business, and the emotion that the brand carries through these numerous touch points.
The experiences that your customer has along this journey creates the new brand. Theexperience-based brand that works across every touch point, and a positive customer experience transforms your consumers from customers into fans. A fan of a brand is more than a customer; while a customer is fickle and may switch your product out for a competitors if they perceive even a slight improvement, a fan will stay with you even when they may have an anomalous negative experience because of the history they have with the brand and the positive experiences you have created. In the market of the future, it will be brands that can create fans using technology that will thrive, as all industries become tech industries.
Ron May, Vice President - e-Solutions, Sysco Corporation is a professional services leader with proven expertise in digital customer experience, direct sales, contract negotiation, P&L management, large scale operations, strategic solution delivery, and cultivation of executive level client relationships.
Mani Kulasooriya is the founder of Sysco LABS (formerly known as CAKE) and led the company from a startup in the Silicon Valley to eventually be acquired by one of the largest companies in the world; Sysco Corporation (NASDAQ: SYY). He has deep connections in the Valley, having worked for companies like Citigroup e-Citi and Yahoo prior to this venture. He is an astute tech investor and has investments in over 25 companies in tech. He has been instrumental in bringing the Silicon Valley thought process and innovation capabilities to Sri Lanka.
Sysco LABS is the innovation arm of Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY), the worlds largest foodservice company. Sysco is the global leader in marketing, selling and distributing food products as well as equipment and supplies to the hospitality industry. Sysco serves over 500,000 customers through its team of over 65,000 associates and operates 300 distribution facilities across the globe.

UPFA quits National Govt; UNP to form own Govt.
	
The United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) has informed President Maithripala Sirisena on Sunday night that it would quit the national government, a party official said.
UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera sent a letter in this regard to the President. The unity government was formed between the UPFA and the United National Party (UNP) soon after the 2015 parliamentary election in order to govern the country for a period of two years that ended in December last year.
UPFA MP, Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara told Daily Mirror that his party had also requested the President to make a reference to the Supreme Court seeking its opinion on the possibility to appoint a new Prime Minister in place of UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe who serves in office at the moment.
According to the 19th Amendment , once a Prime Minister is appointed, the only way in which he can cease to hold office is in terms of Article 46(2) if he (a) resigns his office by a writing under his hand addressed to the President; or (b) ceases to be a Member of Parliament, or if the Cabinet of Ministers is dissolved in terms of Article 48(2) pursuant to the Statement of Government Policy or the Appropriation Bill being defeated in Parliament, or upon the passing of a motion of no confidence against the government.
However, some legal experts argue that the entire Cabinet is rendered illegal once the two parties part ways from the national unity government. Therefore, they say the President has the power to take steps for the appointment of a new Cabinet thereafter, including the Prime Minister.
The President has been asked to seek the opinion of the Supreme Court over this ambiguity.
Meanwhile, it is learnt that the President had shelved the idea for the prorogation of Parliament. Initially, his office had informed MPs that such a move was on the cards and the President was thought to have sent his proclamation to the Government Printer. It was later recalled.

Writers fantasy or critics reality
	
Buddhadasa Galappaththi (Buddhi) is a prolific writer and Mediyamaka Kaluwara (Darkness at noon) is his fourth short story collection, though he is better known for his poetry and journalism.He has produced fourteen books of poetry and poetry criticism to date.In Mediyamaka Kaluwara, Buddhi is mainly concerned with a world of attraction and repulsionbetween the sexes.
Out of the nine stories in the selection, only two  the first and the fifth  dont fall into this category. He is able to tell his stories with economy of words, with no superfluous detail.
But, when it comes to making sense out of what the author is trying to say, I feel troubled, and that is because some of these stories have characters and situations alien to what I know from my cultural conditioning as a Sri Lankan.
Call it the generation gap. The socio-cultural milieu I have known over four decades of life as an adult is conservative when it comes to most things; in matters related to sex, it is overwhelmingly so. But Buddhis characters experience a different reality. I can only apply a personal angle when judging these stories because I must use the parameters of my past experiences and knowledge in this context, not someone elses. If they differ radically from the society I live in, then problems would quickly arise.
Id say that while my views of many matters including the death penalty, the constitution, a secular State, abortion, torture and sexual relations are radically different from those held by most people I know (Unless they are maintaining a faade), the general parameters of my life such as my clothing, job and the company I keep tally with the general yardstick. This isnt due to hypocrisy. Otherwise, Id surely be in jail by now. Im not saying that writers and critics can only write about what they have personally experienced. If that were the case, the world of literature would be severely limited.
Imagination, extrapolation and even conjecture all contribute to a piece of writing. When it comes to criticism, however, the critic develops a hypothesis which has to be supported by his own observations about some aspect of the fictional world developed by the writer. In other words, the critics reality must match the writers fantasy at some level. Why am I going to such lengths to establish the difference between the conventional and the unconventional It is because the same principles which apply to my daily existence are useful when it comes to writing a book review. One reason why we read novels and short stories is that they provide us with insights about people. Their inner worlds and conflicts are revealed to us artistically. While it might take years to gain such an insight on a friend, acquaintance or even family member, a good fiction writer can do that in a single paragraph.
Even if the story is about an exotic culture, we can still recognise common traits and identify ourselves with characters and situations. What else do we mean by universal literature I have never been to the Ireland of James Joyces Dubliners, nor to the Japan of Kenzaburo Oe, not even to the India of Premchand (It is a different India that we experience
as travellers).
You cant go to William Faulkners Yoknapatawpha County because it is fictitious. But I know the people described in their stories. Unfortunately, some of Buddhis characters seem more alien to me because I cant connect with their life experiences.
Now, if you are reviewing science fiction, the critics personal knowledge of science doesnt matter so much because science fiction is usually set in the future. No one knows the science we will have in 3000 AD or even 2064 AD. Therefore, the critic can only go by certain critical criteria applicable to all fiction in general  the quality of prose, powers of description etc.
There again, characterisation doesnt matter so much in science fiction. What really matters is whether the writer can make the reader (and the critic) believe that in 3000 AD people can make themselves invisible under certain conditions etc. But, when it comes to stories about our times and people like us, things are different. In any kind of fiction, credibility matters.
Do we know these people and can we believe themIn the second story of Buddhis collection Rathriya Digamma Digai (The night is very long), Kasun Wickremasinghe is a young executive, married but with a mistress. It is a story about all the anxieties which marital infidelity brings, with fears of being found out.
In the third story, Prema Thrikonaya (Love Triangle), Wimalasiri is a young three-wheeler driver who already has two mistresses and acquires a third by the storys end, with tragic results for himself.
In the fourth May Palu Seethala Reyai (In This Cold and Lonely Night), Maheshika is a young university undergraduate, who sings at a karaoke club to supplement her meagre income. She meets Milinda Jayasekara, a middle-aged businessman, who tells her that she bears an uncanny resemblance to his late wife.
In story No. 6, Yasodhage Katha Wasthuwa (Yasodhas story), Wimalajeewa is an older journalist who marries Yasodha, a much younger lottery seller, whose ex-husband was an abusive man.
In the seventh story Handunagaththoth Oba Maa, (If only you knew me), Imashi Wathsala is a young teledrama actress, who garners her producers help to win the most popular actress of the year contest.
In Sudu Putha Yannama Gihin (Sudu Puthas gone forever), Aravinda Weerasekara is a young journalist who, while doing an investigative story about a prostitution ring, recognises his own mother working as a hostessin a karaoke bar.
In Samugeneema (Farewell), university student Achala rejects her oversexed boyfriend and enters into a lesbian relationship with fellow student Pabasara only to feel hurt, when the latter falls for a businessman.

When it comes to criticism, however, the critic develops a hypothesis which has to be supported by his own observations about some aspect of the fictional world developed by the writer.

All these stories are thematically interesting, and Buddhi is breaking new ground with that last story. But his treatment of these characters and situations leaves me wondering if Buddhi the short story writer, has done an injustice to Buddhi the poet. Im not questioning the credibility of his characters and situations. But they do make me feel like a fish out of water. If we take the character of Maheshika, the young undergraduate from an impoverished family in Ratnapura, she accepts a visiting card from Milinda at the karaoke club where she sings with a calypso band. The next day, she takes the initiative and calls him, and agrees to go with him to his holiday resort. There, he tells her about the tragedy of his life  losing his wife, who looks like Maheshika, to cancer. She realises he is telling the truth when she sees his late wifes photo in his room. They part as friends, and he promises to call her again. We are left wondering: what are they going to talk about
It is a charming story. But I cant fit Maheshika in with the female undergraduates Ive met. It may be that Ive led a sheltered life, or that my experiences in life are strictly limited. But this is where, as a critic, I have troubled evaluating Buddhis story, and the same problem recurs when it comes to many of the other stories in this collection. Going back to his university student, she meets this older businessman at a karaoke club, accepts his visiting card, calls him on her own and agrees to travel with him in his car to his holiday resort. In short, this is a thoroughly modern young woman. None of the female university students Ive met can fit that description. Therefore, she must be exceptional, but the story doesnt tell us that. We are simply left wondering.
Im not saying these are contrived situations. But they stretch my credulity to the limit. In Handunagaththoth Oba Maa, his successful debut actress Imashi Wathsala is a credible character; with only two Advanced Level passes, she sees television acting as the best bet to rise above the circumstances.
She doesnt hesitate to accept her producers clandestine help to become the most popular teledrama actress of the year. But at what price When invited to the spacious restroom which adjoins his office, she expects a seduction in return for his favour. Instead, he turns out to be a noble character, who merely kisses her and sets her free. Hes a family man but yearns for some intimacy.
I can believe that there are noble teledrama producers. Not all of them have to be Harvey Weinsteins. But he could have proved his quality by not inviting her into his restroom in the first place. Decent characters fill his stories. Milinda is one. The womanising three-wheeler driver is decent enough to return the purse left behind by a passenger in a hurry. Udayanga Nanayakkara, the teledrama producer, too, is a decent man.

I can believe that there are noble teledrama producers. Not all of them have to be Harvey Weinsteins. But he could have proved his quality by not inviting her into his restroom in the first place.

Every writer has his central theme and personal universe. Buddhis outlook is positive in all these stories barring Biyakaru Rathriya, which is about a make-up artist who takes a great risk during a time of political kidnappings and murder and pays the ultimate price, and Samuganeema, which is about a young womans search for love which ends in sexual deviation and disappointment. Many of these stories have happy endings. I have nothing against that, and even Pushkin has used them to great effect. The problem is with the overall ambience of these stories.
Perhaps one should bear in mind that famous quote from Tolstoys Anna Karenina:
All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.
In the same way, when characters and situations become predictable, there is a loss of dramatic impact. Then again, what Buddhi describes is a sexually liberal world.
It may actually exist, but I have trouble understanding it because the world I know around me is far more conservative.
The writer may well counter that it is my problem, not his. But there are other problems regarding these stories. The textures described are glossy. He touches upon deep-rooted problems of poverty such as the lottery sellers daily struggle to sell enough tickets to eat.
But we are constantly carried to glossy textures. You cant escape the soft lighting of karaoke clubs and the smell of perfume and attractive women in bathrobes with water still dripping down their bodies. It is entertaining. It can even make for compelling reading. But thats a dangerous word when applied to literature.
Good literature shouldnt try to be entertaining in the same sense that television can be. Mature writers, while they entertain, present us with problems areas too, in their writing. One might think it is easy to make literature out of descriptions of good living and beautiful people. But it is very hard. Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald are among the handful who succeeded. The other problem is Buddhis descriptions of sex. I certainly am no prude (Though Im usually surrounded by them) but if the writer is aspiring to the level of literature (And I cant expect any less from Buddhi) then we need a different approach. Otherwise, sex sounds just like sex, cheapening the entire effort.
If we take an analogy from painting, a nude by Titian and a Playboy centrefold photograph both have lush surfaces. But they are worlds apart in terms artistic achievement.
Describing sex with words is just as tricky as painting or photographing a female nude. You have either art or junk, and there is no middle ground. D. H. Lawrence employed metaphor when describing sex, for which he was derided by some critics. But not everyone can write like Lawrence and Joyce. In whatever language we write about sex-love between man and woman, the fusing of erotica and poetry is a devilishly tricky business  so tricky that many writers dont even try it. Thats why sex as described by Henry Miller or John Irving leaves you wondering just what is it which makes this writing a notch above pornography, or is it a notch below.
I must say that modern Sinhala fiction has a tradition of erotic writing which reached its zenith in the 1960s with books such as Gunadasa Amarasekaras Yali Upannemi.
In that sense, Sinhala fiction was bolder and more honest than its English counterpart in Sri Lanka. Buddhi must be given credit for working within that bold tradition which has been submerged by the tide of Puritanism which pervades all socio-cultural life since the 1980s, so much so that todays generation will likely discover sex through easily available pornographic images rather than good literature.
But writers such as Buddhi should pay more attention to the language if they are aiming at literary fiction.
I hope this criticism will be taken in good faith. I dont want to brand these stories as commercial writing because all writing is more or less commercial in that writers aspire to get published and make a living.
But that more or less are the operative words here. If Anton Chekhov were writing today, one can imagine him writing to hundreds of publishers and finally settling for self-publication or e-books. The same might happen to Hemingways short stories because they have no gloss and nothing much seems to happen to them.
Thats why modern writers bring in more texture, some of it glossy. William Boyd is a good example of that kind of writing. Lasting value is another matter. Trying to decide which writers which book will last is beyond any critic, or indeed, any writer. One can only do ones best and hope for the best. This is where I expect more from a writer like Buddhi.
