Dr. Nonis hits back at SEC
	
Chairman of Mackwoods Plantations Pvt Ltd, Dr Chrishantha Nonis said that the sale of 60.8% shares of the Agalawatte Plantations PLC was carried out with due authorization and instructions being issued to the stock broker.
In a response to the directive issued by the Securities and Exchanges Commission on 20th July, Dr. Nonis stated, the action by the SEC in issuing a directive on a complaint made by non-shareholders, without making any formal inquiries into the matter, is highly questionable. The sale of Agalawatte shares was completed on 14th July 2016 and six days after the share transaction was concluded, the SEC on 20th July issued a directive stating that shareholder approval had not been obtained.
The stock broking firm has informed the SEC that the contents in the directive are incorrect in that the instructions received were not only from Dr. Chris Nonis but also from Mrs. Shelendra Ranaweera and Mr. Lalith Fonseka, which information was available to the SEC.
The letter further states that the SEC should not interfere with the internal affairs of Mackwoods Plantations (Private) Ltd, and has requested that the SEC withdraw its allegations.

Explosives supplier for fireworks defied MOD rules nabbed
	
A supplier of explosives for manufacturing fireworks, who was illegally possessing over 800 kilos of Potassium Perchlorate which had been imported defying regulations of the Ministry of Defence was nabbed by Negombo Police this evening.
The police on information raided a warehouse in Negombo Town and found over 800 kilos of the powerful chemical which is being used as a material included in explosives.
Upon inquiry, the police learnt that the owner of the contraband did not possess a permit issued by the Ministry of Defence to import such material which is considered to be illegal to be used in the local fireworks manufacturing industry.
The police also found 25 kilos of Potassium Nitrate and 85 kilos of Potassium Chloride along with 16 barrels that contained 800 kilos of Potassium Perchlorate.
Moreover, the concern of the police was that the person had illegally stored these powerful chemicals amidst a heavily populated urbanized area in the centre of the Negombo Town, whereas he had been permitted to store his raw materials in Katana areas.
When contacted, Explosives Controller of Gampaha District V P Wijetunga said that Potassium Perchlorate has never been permitted to be imported to Sri Lanka nor used in the making of fireworks as it dangerously enhances the aftermath of any cracker or firework explosion.
He also said that if any accident leading to an explosion would have caused a major destruction in the Negombo Town, when the fireworks owner had defied orders to store them in a secure location away from an urbanized area. (Ranjith Ferdinand )

Journalists defending previous regime will have to be dealt with- PM
	
Media personnel who defended the previous regime, which robbed the country, will have to be dealt with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said on Saturday.
Speaking at a United National Party (UNP) membership drive in Kandy, the Premier said these media personnel had no issue with those who robbed the nation as they were wined and dined by those in the previous government.
"Last Monday's Daily Mirror called for the removal of Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera. I know the editor of the Daily Mirror. He once wrote saying I too should be removed from UNP leadership. We will have to see what we should do if he does not resign from his post. He is possessed by Mahinda Rajapaksa. Daily Mirror carried anti Tamil, anti Muslim articles. We should teach them a lesson before they call for the resignation of our ministers," he said.
The Premier also said the Financial Times had also carried such adverse news items throughout a month attempting to sabotage the economy of the country.
We asked for a loan of 1.5 billion USD but we were offered 6.7 USD billion instead. However, we got only 1.5 billion USD since we didnt want more than that. We would like to tell these journalists not to play the fool with this government. We will run for five years. I will be criticized for saying this but that's okay. Media can criticize but if they try to appoint thieves by acting against the government elected by the people, they have to be put in with the thieves," he said.
The Prime Minister said he has been fighting for media freedom always. If necessary, I can even reveal the names of those who I will be summoning in the near future. Media can criticize the government, I have nothing against it. But they shouldnt try to destroy the government led by President Maithripala Sirisena. We know they were dining with the Rajapaksas but now its me who is in Temple Trees and I wont give away free food or send invitations, he said.(Yohan Perera and J. A. L. Jayasinghe )

JVP will never form a govt: Bandula
	
Colombo District Parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardene said the JVP, would never realise its dream of forming a government in 2020.
Addressing a meeting of the Panadura Joint Opposition Organisation at the Pinwatta White Heaven Hotel to organise the Joint Oppositions Pada Yatra demonstration, he pointed out that the people still remembered who created a season of terror by entering the houses by force at the dead of night and taking away the identity cards by force, by setting fire to public property and even by killing people in cold blood.
Former Minister Basil Rajapaksa was remanded on the charge of issuing GI pipes to the local authorities. Even the Court refused to release him on bail. The country was busy like a bee hive during the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime. We noticed construction site in every nook and corner. Road net work in the country was developed. However, all development activities have ground to a halt today depriving livelihood to at least 500,000 people. Meanwhile tea, rubber and coconut industries that were the main foreign exchange earners have declined while paddy cultivation has been ruined he said.
Nuwara Eliya District Parliamentarian C.B. Ratnayake and Kalutara District Parliamentarian Rohitha Abeygunawardene addressed the gathering. (Saman Kariyawasam and Kusal Chamath)
