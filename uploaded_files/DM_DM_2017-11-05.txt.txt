Govt. committed to maximum transparency: President
	
Many development projects had been implemented islandwide today allocating a huge amount of money and the present Government was committed to ensure maximum transparency when implementing those development projects, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
He recalled that he left the previous Government because he was against fraud and corruption, and added that in this Government too, irrespective of political differences, legal actions would be taken against all the wrongdoers as it was the main characteristic of the concept of Good Governance.
President Sirisena made these remarks participating at a ceremony to open the newly constructed building at the Elahera District Secretariat on Saturday.
We can see some officials are reluctant to take decisions in the process of development. No State official should be scared to fulfill their respective responsibilities honestly.
President Sirisena vested several development projects in the Elahera- Bakamuna area with the public and students.
The three-storied building, built at the Mahasen Maha Vidyalaya in Bakamuna was vested with the students by President Sirisena.
The new building has two Technical Units and eight classrooms and was constructed at a cost of Rs.16.8 million.

Hambantota port joint venture to start on Dec. 08
	
The joint venture between China Merchants Port Holding Company (CMPH) and Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) to operate the Hambantota Harbour would start operations on December 8, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe who was speaking at a function to distribute land title deeds to people in Deniyaya this morning said the Government was thinking of closing the port down as there were no funds to operate it.
"It was the Chinese President who suggested forming a joint venture between the Sri Lankan Government and Chinese Company," he said.
Mr. Wickremesinghe highlighted that Sri Lanka had no way of using the revenue generated from Colombo Port any longer and there was a dire need to think of another option.
He also revealed that the joint venture between the Airport and Aviation Authority and an Indian Company to run Mahinda Rajapaksa International Airport in Mattala would come into operation by March next year.
As the Prime Minister put it, the situation with regard to Mattala Airport would be same as the Hambantota Port.
Accordingly, it was stressed that Airport and Aviation Authority would turn the airport into a profit-making venture.
Mr. Wickremesinghe then listed out a number of projects associated with the Hambantota Economic Zone.
Accordingly, he said an LNG plant which would supply electricity to the entire South districts, a dockyard and tourism ventures would come in the region.
However, he said the Government was yet to decide on the Suriyawewa Cricket Stadium as no one was interested in it.
Elaborating on the debt situation, he said the Government had decided to go ahead with the settlement within the next two years, despite the advice given by some to delay the repayment.
We did want to delay the repayment of debt which amounts to dollars three trillion as we decided not give this burden to the future generations, he said.
Ministers Sagala Ratnayake and Gayantha Karunathilaka, who also spoke said distribution of land title deeds would help people solve several issues such as getting their children admitted to schools. (Yohan Perera)

Something fishy over fuel shortage: TU
	
The employees of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CEYPETCO) today charged that there was a covert move by the Indian Oil Company (IOC) to fraudulently dump a substandard stock of 30, 000 metric tons of petrol in the domestic market, which was rejected as substandard.
While admitting that there was a 20% shortage of petrol supply in the domestic market due to a rejection of a stock of 30, 000 metric tons of petrol the said however, the CEYPETCO said it would manage to supply the full demand of petrol.
Minister Ranatunga made an appeal to motorists to use petrol sparingly until new stocks arrived and not to panic over the shortage.
The rejection of 30, 000 MTs of petrol due to quality failure at the laboratory tests has caused panic among motorists and long queues of motor vehicles were seen at filling stations islandwide in the last couple of days.
The General Secretary of the Ceylon Petroleum Common Workers Union (CPCWU) D. G. Rajakaruna said CEYPETCO prohibited the pumping of a shipment of 30, 000 metric tons of oil imported by the IOC on October 15 after it was found that the shipment was not up to the quality.
The IOC gave an undertaking to CEYPETCO that the rejected shipment would be replaced with a fresh stock of petrol by October 30, which it failed to comply with. The IOC on October 27 simply said it could not replace the rejected stock with a new stock that led to the shortage, Mr. Rajakaruna said.
Mr. Rajakaruna told the Daily Mirror that the next shipment of petrol was due at Colombo Port by Wednesday (8) and it would reach filling stations by late Thursday.
We have valid reasons to believe that there is something fishy in this whole affair. The rejected shipment is still berthed at the Trincomalee harbour. We dont know for what purpose.
We have also information that the IOC management has met top officials of the Petroleum Resources Development Ministry, probably to woo them to agree to reaccept the rejected shipment. We also have no answer as to why the IOC suddenly said it could not replace the rejected petroleum shipment on time as promised with a fresh stock that created the shortage of petroleum in the market, Mr. Rajakaruna added.
He said the crisis clearly manifests the necessity of CEYPETCO maintaining a buffer stock sufficient for at least one month of petroleum products as opposed to current two weeks of buffer stock.
To have a sufficient buffer stock, the CYEPETCO needs a minimum of 15 tanks from Trincomalee tank farm. But the Government has failed to obtain at least ten tanks even after the Cabinet approval was granted to transfer ownership of 15 tanks to CEYPETCO.
We are highly worried on the ability of the IOC that has only 20% of market share to cripple the domestic petrol market in this manner, Mr. Rajakaruna lamented.
He also said the Government must immediately find an investor to upgrade and modernise the Sapugaskanda oil refinery, which is at its last stage of operation and produces only the half of the full capacity.
Mr. Rajakaruna in a letter to Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga requested to conduct an inquiry on the suspicious behaviour of the IOC and its refusal to replace the rejected shipment of petrol on time and take punitive action if found the IOC had acted in a sabotaging manner.
