Amana Banks Dear Dad campaign touches emotions.
	
As a Bank whichrecognizes the importance of social values, Amana Bank took the initiative to remind society that fathers day is not to be celebrated on one specific day, but rather every day throughout the year.

The Dear Dad campaign was aimed at bringing out these unspoken words in honouring the love and guidance showered upon us by our beloved fathers.
Expressing their sentiments on the promotion, a winning entrant said I am truly grateful for what my father has done for me and I appreciate that Amna Bank has taken this initiative to convey the positive message of not celebrating fathers day only on a particular day as every day is a fathers day.

Coming Submarine Wars: Implications for Sri Lanka
	

ialogues, conferences, conventions around broader themes of maritime security is shaping Sri Lanka security discourse in a grand way. Geographic location and its strategic connotation coming to an intense geo political competition has elevated Sri Lankas own engagement to respond and comprehend the securitization of the Indo-Pacific ocean systems. 
This article will focus on the spectrum of submarine warfare and related security discussion that needs detailed attention by the administration and the security establishment. It needs further research by both academic and think tank communities in Sri Lanka. As submarine platforms are hailed as decisive in the emerging strategic competition in the Indian Ocean.

Indian Ocean and Sri Lankan Strategy
Sri Lanka as a hub in the Indian Ocean has been the mantra of the previous administration and the current administration has supercharged this position. Prime Minister Wickramasinghe is heading a serious effort for Sri Lanka to be a pivot state in creating a code of conduct in the Indian Ocean. One major challenge for this initiative will be handling the ever increasing militarization of the Indian Ocean and especially what happens not on the surface but beneath.


"PM Wickramasinghe is heading a serious effort for Sri Lanka to be a pivot state in creating a code of conduct in the Indian Ocean. One major challenge for this initiative will be handling the ever increasing militarization of the Indian Ocean"


The ministry of foreign affairs recently set up a division on Ocean Affairs, Strategic Security, Climate Change and Policy Planning, which is commendable. While such moves are imperative for Sri Lankas strategic posture and security readiness our focus has largely been on narratives of Indian Ocean security that is linked with development of trade, safe guarding ocean resources and confronting maritime crime.

From surface to underwater militarization
Submarines have been part of the conversation about the emerging maritime competition among rising Asian powers and the important role of submarines and anti-submarine warfare has become security priorities in many Asian nations. This article attempts to create a preliminary interest to push our policy makers, analysts, security establishment, and media to understand the rapid transformation of the undersea militarization and technological advancement and their strategic implications on a country that is totally reliant on the ocean eco system for its very existence.
Amidst escalating geo political tensions in the Indo-Pacific region, it is vital to understand the role of the submarines or undersea battle theatre. The Strategic advantage of transiting undetected and carrying significant weapons payloads that can both strike sea surface targets and land targets adds significant strategic value to these naval platforms . Apart from strike capabilities undersea vessels are used for surveillance, mapping of the sea bed thus increasing power projection capabilities of navies that possess them. 

Asias submarine competition
Asia Pacific is littered with literals, choke points, island chains, islets, thus 21st century security challenges of the Indian ocean demands that navies deploy vessels that could navigate, fight and win in such spaces, thus submarines of various dimensions, and various configurations have become the most preferred asset to be used in such conditions by the United States and many other Asian nations.
Asia Pacific has become not just the zone of intense naval build ups it is also the zone where massive investments are made by large to small powers in submarine fleets and acquiring anti-submarine capabilities. The largest spenders are India, China, Australia, Singapore, Japan and Vietnam. Even countries such as Myanmar, Thailand and Malaysia are having ambitious plans to develop under sea capabilities. Indonesia and South Korea are two mid-level powers in the region that intensified their bi lateral ocean defence partnerships and are actively engaged in expanding submarine capabilities.
There are two ancillary strategic developments apart from submarines in the region, the first is the development and research of Unmanned Undersea Vessels (UUVs), while the world attention was very much taken by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) such as the predators and reapers the CIA operated in its targeted killing of terror suspects. Thus development and investment into Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) have accelerated not just in the United States. China has initiated a massive investment intosuch platforms.
The second is the increasing competition to create deep sea detection systems as a way of sea denial, China has invested millions of dollars to create an integrated undersea warning system that could detect enemy submarine or surface vessel movement. Western military analysts call this the Underwater Great Wall that is lined with networked seabed sensors, that functions as an integrated undersea monitoring system. China intends to integrate the warning system with unmanned underwater vehicles as a vanguard defence to counter
enemy movements.
When the Dutch born inventor William Bourne designed the underwater rowing boat in the late 16th century he would not have imagined how his designs and concepts have become paramount in a new era of sea warfare. While China is expected to reach 70 plus mostly new submarines which are diesel powered attack craft, they also are expanding on their nuclear attack submarine capabilities. 
India and Australia have accelerated their own submarine development programs. India is expanding its submarine presence between both its coasts, Vishakapatnam was the only submarine base till recently and India has set up the new Varsha naval base for submarines in Rambilli , Andhra Pradesh.
India has an ambition to reach 25 submarines within the next five years, it commissioned Frenchbuilder Naval Group, formerly known as DCNS, to build six scorpene class diesel powered, attack submarines, two are already completed. The same company won a deal worth Australian $50 million to build half a dozen attack submarines for Australia. 
With countries like Pakistan increasing its interests on submarine technologies and Iran developing its on indigenous submarine platforms that will have major bearing on the strategic calculus of the Asia Pacific. Currently it is estimated nearly dozen countries operate over 200 submarines in the region and they are estimated to double over the next decade. Whether Sri Lanka is ready for such a surge needs to be addressed.

The next stage of Submarine Warfare
United States the primary developer of autonomous weapons systems is showing clear signs of deviating from their primary interests of UAVs and land Robotic systems to concentrate more on under water and surface robotic systems. It parallels American strategic realignment of interests from Middle East to greater oceanic spaces of Asia. It is estimated that 60% of AmericanSubmarine strength is now diverted to the Indo-Pacific region. 
Large defence contractors and American special innovation agency for the defence department are working together in advancing robotic submarine technologies. They are primarily looking at incorporating longer range, increasing payload capabilities of these machine systems. They are developing both undersea and surface platforms. 
Another significant development is the introduction of XLUUV class of UUV technology. The XL stands for extra-large robotic under sea vessels. Already American defence manufacturer is working on the Boeing Echo Voyager an advanced XLUUV which is nearing full operation, and China is responding in kind.
China has established a vast research and development facility purely for UUVs in Zhuhai, Guangdong province. They are already experimenting on XLUUV such as D3000 an unmanned oceanic combat vessel with a large range and a three month operational capability without need to refuel or reach land.

Implications for Sri Lanka
While robotic submarines and surface vessels and their application for actual operations may take more time, the rapid speed in which artificial intelligence (AI) is incorporated into weapons technologies are changing the global security landscape. AI is a driving force behind UUVs and weapons such as smart Torpedoes and missiles when it comes to the Indian Ocean. 
Sri Lanka may not be able to acquire the costly technology but to be ready and at least have a strategy that entails collaboration to create under sea detection and monitoring technologies may help us face the challenges emanating from submarine and undersea vessels in the future. If we remain unprepared and disinterested our very location advantage will be taken over by foreign navies and our seas will be infested with foreign vessels with great risk to our national security.

Contempt rule against Ranjan: AG submits draft rule to SC
	
The Attorney General today (30) furnished a draft Rule before the Supreme Court against Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake complaining of him for having committed an alleged offence of Contempt of Court.
The Bench comprised Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, Justices Vijith K. Malalgoda and Lalith Dehideniya, who will peruse it and make a decision on September 5.
The Court on June 18 directed the Attorney General to furnish a draft Rule against Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake to show cause as to why he should be charged for in respect of two petitions complaining of him for having committed the alleged offence of Contempt of Court.
Presidents Counsel M.A.Sumanthiran with Jerusha Crossette Thambiah appearing for Ranjan Ramanayake submitted that the procedure should be followed in all courts according to Section 793 of the Criminal Procedure Code in Chapter 9 which reads the procedure shall be followed in all courts.
Accordingly, it is the person who complains who should forward the summons containing the charges to be served on the respondent and the Attorney General has no role in the proceedings.
Additional Solicitor General Priyantha Navana had cited that the proceedure followed in former Minister S.B. Dissanayakes case was that it was the Attorney General who drafted the Rule for Contempt.
However, Counsel Sumanthiran submitted that this case could not be followed because the expressed provision of the law was not followed in that case and that the practice of the Court cannot override the expressed provision of law.

An aviator is a unique and skilled individual with years of training and hard work as the foundation of his career. To become a military pilot it takes twice as much skill and training. Being an air force pilot takes thinking-on-your-feet and making critical decisions in seconds to a whole new level. In the cockpit where the smallest error can cost lives, one is forced to rely on ones training, experience and skills. It takes well qualified mentors and facilities of the highest standard to hone the skill and implement the training to produce pilots who will be the pride of the nation. Thus it is with great pride that the Fairway Aviation Academy announces its selection as a place of training for flight cadets of the Sri Lanka Air Force.
A subsidiary of Fairway Holdings (Pvt) Ltd, the Fairway Aviation Academy consists of a team of dedicated and expert instructors, who follow a time proven curriculum that has been developed to cultivate the necessary thinking-methods, instincts and skills in a pilot.
From left : Captain Sanjaya Adikari CEO Aviation Sector Fairway Holdings, Captain Chira Fernando- Head of training and Standards, Rifa Mustapha Executive Director Aviation Sector, Imal Fonseka Group CEO Fairway Holdings, Air Marshal Kapila Jayampathi Commander of the Sri Lanka Air Force, Air Vice Marshal Sudarshana Pathirana, Director Air Operations, Air Vice Marshal Priyantha Weerasingha, Director Training, Group Captain Herath, Chief Procurement Officer
The academy is extremely grateful to the Sri Lanka Air Force for placing such confidence in them. This is a testimony to the fact that the Fairway Aviation Academys resources, aircraft and facilities are of the highest standard. A batch of flight cadets will complete their basic training of 92 hours under the guidance of the academys Chief Executive Officer and the Head of Training & Standards. Both gentlemen are former air force pilots and are thus well-aware of what is required and expected of a military aviator. A special curriculum has been implemented for the Air Force cadets, one that differs from that which is followed in the training of civilian pilots.
The Fairway Aviation Academy is confident that when these cadets graduate, they will have a place among the best of the best aviators in Sri Lanka.

From cricketer to Premier  - Imran Khan - EDITORIAL
	

mran Khans Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf on Saturday emerged the single largest party in Pakistans 2018 general elections. The party won 116 seats, just short of simple majority (137) needed for a simple majority. 
And Imran Khan - Pakistans former cricket captain turned politician -- is set to lead Pakistan yet again... this time as its Prime Minister
The election result marks the culmination of a political struggle begun 22 years ago when he traded his popularity in the field of sports for the rough and tumble of Pakistani politics. His anti-corruption crusade was initially scorned and he spent years on the political fringe.
But his determination never wavered.
The disputed general elections of 2013 marked a turning point in his political career. In August 2014 he led a Freedom March of over 100,000 from Lahore to Islamabad staging rallies against alleged ballot rigging, claiming a conspiracy involving Prime Minister Nawaz Sharifs Pakistan Muslim League (N), senior judges, Punjab government officials and highlighted corruption in high places. The demonstrations called for the resignation of the government and demanding the holding of fresh elections. 
Following the explosive Panama Papers which exposed ex-Prime Minister Sharif and his familys role in a billion-dollar corruption scandal Imran Khan went to Court demanding Sharifs dismissal from office on corruption charges.
With Sharifs conviction and dismissal from political office, Khans political stature grew by leaps and bounds. With 44% of the electorate aged between 18% to 35%, Imrans anti-corruption drive and calls to break the two main dynastic parties found mass support among young voters tired of the corrupt dynastic rule of the two main parties.
And so it was by Saturday despite earlier making charges of foul play, former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharifs PML-N conceded defeat to the former cricket star ahead of final results. 
In the run up to the election, Imran portrayed himself as the outsider who would clean up Pakistans dirty politics.
If in the days ahead if all goes smoothly it will be only the second time in Pakistans history a civillian government will have been replaced via the electoral process.
The cricketer turned politician now poised to be the countrys Prime Minister faces a multitude of problems.
Pakistan is awash with violence, religious extremism, dire poverty and a worsening economic situation. Its international relations are not the best. India and Afghanistan both charge it with exporting terrorism. The US has cut its aid. Imran himself has taken a harsh attitude to India, and has referred to Talibans war against US presence in Afghanistan as a holy war.
In the aftermath of his election victory, Khan took on a more conciliatory attitude. Reaching out to India, he said he wanted talks to resolve the dispute over Kashmir. if India takes one step towards us, we will take two steps towards them.
However promises of better relations with his giant nuclear-armed neighbour are going to depend on Pakistans military, which has been responsible for coups and instigating movements which brought down elected leaders who espoused better relations with India.
Compromises will have to be made.
Imran had the ability to weld Pakistans individually great cricketers into a world cup winning outfit. Perhaps the great Khan has possibly the best chance to unite his country and ease its divisions.
To Imrans eternal credit also stands the the magnificent cancer and cancer research hospitals in Pakistan costing billions of dollars which provide free treatment to Pakistans desperately poor masses. It was his single-minded perseverance and honesty which drew in the funds and brought the project to fruition. 
While wishing Pakistans new political captain the best, his victory and challenges ahead are best summed up in the tweet from his first wife Jemina Khan ...my sons father is Pakistans next PM. It is an incredible lesson in tenacity, belief and refusal to accept defeat. The challenge is now to remember why he entered politics in the first place...

Govt. wants to retain MRIA ownership: Champika
	
The Government was looking for ways to retain the ownership of the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA) while handing over operations to a third party, Western Development Minister Champika Ranawaka said yesterday.
The MRIA makes about Rs 1.2 mn a month, however, we need about Rs. 250 mn to maintain it, he said.
The entire income generated by the Katunayake Airport goes to maintain the Mattala Airport, he said.
He was speaking to the media after attending a function to declare open a new library building at the Salalankaratissa Vidyalaya in Matugama.
He said that each citizen had borne Rs. 800 to build the airport.
The airport was built without conducting a proper study. Therefore the Government is looking whether the airport operations can be handed over to a third party, while keeping the ownership, the Minister said.
Discussions are underway between Sri Lanka aviation authorities and Indian authorities. They have not yet come to a final decision on the matter. When the proposal is submitted to the Cabinet the proposal will open for public discussion, he said.
He also said that people should decide whether to waste millions of money for a place with zero advantage.
He said that the Civil Aviation Authority would be unable to make profit from Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport during the next two decades. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

India to send back seized turtles to Sri Lanka
	
Indian forest department plans to send back a consignment of exotic turtles to Sri Lanka, mostly red-eared sliders, that was seized from a passenger at airport recently.
According to sources, officials are planning to send it back to Sri Lanka as it came from there, the Indian Express reported.
Sources added that SriLankan Airlines also failed to notice the consignment carrying the turtles during security check with the reptiles kept in different boxes inside a stroller bag.Last year, Customs caught hold of another Sri Lankan passenger with 3,000 red-eared sliders at Chennai International Airport. In many such cases, the Forest department was helpless in taking tough action against such illegal importers as these non-native species are not listed under the scheduled lists of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.
These foreign turtles are popularly known as Singapore turtle or American turtle in the pet market in India and is widely imported without proper documents as many people believe that keeping it would bring luck. The growing demand for these exotic species has encouraged many people to illegally import these reptiles from illegally operating breeding units in several Asian countries. These baby turtles would be brought from a captive breeding facility as most of them are of the same size. Otherwise, it is impossible to get these many turtles of similar size, said Muralidharan M, an eminent turtle biologist and marine researcher.
Even in this case, experts confirmed that the Forest department will be able to take action against the passenger only for importing it without proper documents.

Jammers in exam halls not practical: Harin
	
Installing mobile phone signal jamming equipment at examination centres during the GCE Advanced Level examinations was not practical, Telecommunication, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment Minister Harin Fernando said.
The Department of Examinations had announced that it would install jammers in view of disabling mobile phone signals within the examination centres during the GCE Advanced Level examination.
The DoE decided to launch a pilot project to disable mobile phone signals within the examination centres during the national exams from GCE Advanced Level examinations, scheduled to be held this August.
Addressing a news briefing, Minister Fernando said installing jammers within the examination centres would create problems because it may inconvenience other individuals, who were not involved in the examinations.
Department of Examinations has not yet discussed the proposal with the Telecommunication Ministry. However, we would have discussions with the officials of the Department of Examinations and come to an effective method, he said.
He said it was trickier if the jammers could be affixed to the towers but was costly.
The best way to avoid mobile phones from being used within exams centres is to conduct a full body checkup of the candidates, prior to the commencement of the examinations, he said.(Sheain Fernandopulle)

Telescopes at Colombo Uni. open to public to watch Planet Mars tomorrow
	
Large telescopes in the Colombo University would be open for the general public to watch Planet Mars as well as planets Saturn, Jupiter and Venus till 10.00 p.m on July 31, Colombo University Astronomy and Space Science Unit Director Prof. Chandana Jayaratna said.
He said the public can come to the Colombo University play ground from 7-10 pm on Tuesday (31) if the sky is free from clouds and take part in this activity.
Prof. Jayaratna said the planet Mars, the only planet whose surface we can see using ground based telescopes (except for tiny mercury) is coming closer to the earth on July 31 after 15 years.
He said it was last seen this closer in 2003 and next closest would be in 2020 and super closest is on 2035.
At the close approach, the red planet will be brighter than all the stars in the night sky and therefore you will never miss this reddish colour planet as a naked eye bright object in the eastern sky after the sun set. Look at the eastern skies late these evenings and if the sky is clear with no clouds you could see the shining yellow-orange color planet Mars above the horizon between the star constellation Capricornus he said.
This is the nearest that Mars has come((57.6 million kilometers to earth) since its record-breaking close approach in August 28, 2003. At that time it passed by at a distance of only 55.8 million kilometers , the closest it had come in 59,619 years.
There are observational camps conducted by astronomers all over the world to observe this rare event. The most striking features on Mars' surface on these days will be the brilliant white polar cap and a dust storm, Prof. Jayaratna said.
The planet will remain bright for several weeks, and public can also view the planets Saturn, Jupiter and Venus in a "long arc across the sky from east to west" shortly after sunset, he said.
The Colombo University Astronomical Society would conduct another two astronomical night sky observation camps jointly with the Committee for the popularization of Science of the Sri Lanka Association for the Advancement of Science on August 1 at the Vijitha Madya Maha Vidyalaya in Pollonnaruwa and at the Sinhala Madya Maha Vidyalaya in Trincolamlee on August 2. It would be open to school children and the general public from 7.00-9.00 p.m.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

War on Drugs in Sri Lanka:  Science or fiction
	
STF personnel are seen having seized one of the largest hauls of heroin in the country in during a routine raid in the Colombo city suburbs.


Some may think that the death penalty is too harsh a penalty. I do not think so. Many countries have come to the stage where they accept the death penalty (Ranil Wickremesinghe, 1984).
Prime Minister Ranil Wickermesinghe stated the above during the parliamentary debate on the Poisons Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance of 1929 Amendment Bill on March 22, 1984. At the time, he was the Minister of Education who endorsed President JR Jayewardenes proposal to introduce the death sentence for drug related offences. Despite its inefficacy, the death sentence for drug-related offences is back on the policy agenda and political limelight. The evidence of the steady rise in drug seizures, arrests, drug-related prison admissions, drug use, drug related harm and relatively stable drug prices suggests that the nations policy on drugs that existed for over three decades needs re-thinking. 
There had been a number of articles written on the subject matter although none looked at the origins of the death sentence for drug related offences in Sri Lanka. Furthermore, there is little information on the socio-economic and political factors associated in adopting and implementing this policy choice. This article will focus on the above information gap, identifying and discussing some of the drivers for the war on drugs. I will apply a policy science approach to understand drug policy development that is situated in the history of Sri Lanka.

The heroin epidemic in the 1980s
By the late 1970s there existed a growing cohort of aging opium and cannabis users. The novelty of a heroin epidemic, introduced by tourists in the late 1970s was largely confined to Colombo and some parts of southern Sri Lanka. Young people started using heroin, which concerned the politicians, clergy and the general public due to the uncertainties created on how to manage a novel drug problem. There also existed a belief among policy-makers and politicians that a drug-free society is absolutely required for the socio-economic development of the country, particularly as young people were considered as the wealth of the nation. 
Politicians, prominent Buddhist monks and Christian priests were questioning the meaning of moral values and good citizenship in society. The use of intoxicants was seen as immoral, and those who used drugs were seen as social outcasts. Consequently there was a moral underpinning to the policy-making and political concerns at the time. Their moral ideology regarded drugs as dangerous, threatening to cultural values and as evil substances that compromised the values in Sri Lankan culture. State intervention and tough law enforcement were seen as legitimate responses to foster moral and upright behaviour. 
By 1982, Interpol confirmed Sri Lankas status as a transit country for the movement of heroin from countries in the Golden Triangle into Europe, with organised international drug trafficking syndicates operating within Sri Lanka. During this period, evidence also emerged of a link between heroin trafficking carried out by the LTTE and financial proceeds being used to fund terrorism. With the escalation of violence between Sinhalese and Tamils, and the demand for a separate Tamil state in the North and East of Sri Lanka, drug trafficking was perceived as a major problem and a direct threat to national security and stability of government. Politicians and law enforcement personnel viewed the existing legislation at the time as being outdated to manage the emerging new trends of drug use and trafficking. The Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance of 1929 was amended within this national context. The amendments ensured the introduction of the death sentence for drug-related offences, stringent law enforcement on drug users and traffickers, and the creation of the National Dangerous Drug Control Board to coordinate all efforts related to drug control. 
Policies adopted since 1984 ensured that the response to the drug problem was firmly located within the criminal justice system leading to a large number of drug users being imprisoned. Out of the total prison population in the country, nearly 45% of men and women were admitted for narcotic-related offences in 2000, the largest single category according to the Handbook of Drug Abuse Information published by the National Dangerous Drug Control Board in 2002. The majority of drug-related prison admissions were for heroin related offences (88%) with the remaining (12%) for cannabis. These figures remain stable 17 years later and indicate that a large proportion of people who are in the prison system are drug users as opposed to large scale traffickers. 
The international environment had a significant influence in regard to the introduction of the death sentence and in shaping drug policy in Sri Lanka. I will now discuss this in some detail. 

International context and national political landscape
During the 1980s, within the Asia Pacific region, countries such as Malaysia, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Indonesia introduced the death penalty for drug related offences. The rapid spread of this populist policy option across the Asia Pacific region may be the result of a process whereby government elites copied the social commitments made by other governments, considering them to be advanced, progressive and morally praiseworthy. It is learned that Sri Lanka copied the death sentence from Singapore and Malaysia at the time without any scientific knowledge about its efficacy as a policy option. These were both similar economically, capitalist countries with legislation to use the death sentence for people convicted of drug-related offences. Sri Lankan elite decision-makers at the time were inspired by these countries economic growth, indicating a desire to follow their path to development. 
Although there was limited consensus on the introduction of the death penalty between police officers and politicians, President JR Jayawardena who held executive power was able to obtain unilateral agreement from not only Cabinet colleagues to back the Amendment Bill, but also the support for the death sentence from Members of Parliament. However, its application has been symbolic as there have been no executions of drug users or traffickers.When a death sentence is issued, the presiding judge states that the person should be imprisoned and executed at a time nominated by the President. Over the last three decades, none of the Presidents in office has implemented the order, which in effect suspends the death sentence effectively to one of life imprisonment. So, why is it not implemented or abolished 


Seen to be tough on crime
Initially, policy-makers have been of the opinion that the death sentence would be a deterrent against drug use and trafficking. The introduction of the death sentence signalled a tough law enforcement and zero tolerance approach. However, research conducted worldwide on its efficacy states that it is a costly failure. A failure simply because it has not been able to reduce crime, drug use, drug related arrests and prison admissions. Some also argue that the death penalty violates international conventions on human rights as it denies the most basic and fundamental human right, the right to life. However, its existence has been of interest to Presidents, politicians and some senior civil servants who advised Presidents in Sri Lanka.
All Presidents in Sri Lanka have been keen supporters of the death sentence and the prevailing policy on drug control that existed for over three decades. However, some Presidents may have appeared tough on crime, particularly in regard to stringent law enforcement against drug users and traffickers for time to time. The fact that the President, the most powerful politician in the country, had a keen interest in, and control over drug policy, is indicative of its importance to the core of economic, political and social decision-making. 
There had been unanimous support in Parliament for President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga to pass a resolution in 1995 to implement capital punishment. In 1999, President Kumaratunga did implement it by issuing a Presidential Proclamation, so it would become a deterrent to organised and serious criminals in the country. However, in the face of strong opposition from national and international human rights groups, the death sentences have been automatically commuted to life imprisonment. In January 2001, the government revoked this decision to automatically commute the capital punishment sentence to one of life imprisonment. 
Implementing the death penalty was raised again following the assassination of a prominent High Court Judge Sarath Ambepitiya and his bodyguard on November 19, 2004. The deaths were suspected of being an order given to the assassins from a major drug trafficker. Justice Ambepitiya had given a life sentence to a woman who had trafficked drugs on the day of his assassination. A Judge being assassinated for the first time in Sri Lanka and the link to a drug trafficker was a major political concern due to the implications for state security and the independence of the judiciary. Afterwards President Kumaratunga seized the opportunity to again try to implement the death penalty for the crimes of murder, rape and drug trafficking. Capital punishment for convicted drug traffickers had been a politically charged issue and appears to have been associated with politicians perceptions of the will of the electorate. 
From time to time, Buddhist monks, Christian priests and the public have lobbied for the implementation of the death sentence. Public attitudes towards the drug problem had been utilized by elected officials to legitimize government action on prohibition and tough law enforcement. While the legitimization of prohibition was inextricably linked to the need to maintain a more moral and secure society, prohibition also served the agenda of politically active groups and the electorate. Seen to be tough on crime during periods of increased crime reports in the media appears common and popular among Presidents. It can be considered as populist policy, merely political rhetoric to attract votes and support. 
Some ministers in the present government do not personally believe that implementation of the death sentence is the magic bullet for problems concerning drugs in contemporary Sri Lanka. Recently, Dr. Rajitha Senaratna, Mangala Samaraweera and some other Ministers publicly stated that they did not personally support the idea of capital punishment. Some sections of the Buddhist community and Christian priests also shared these views as they believed in abstaining from taking life. Although these dissenting views exist, collectively, President Maithripala Sirisena and his cabinet supports this populist policy, which seems to be their response to rising crime reports in Sri Lanka.

Future directions
Existing legislation on drugs muddles drug users and traffickers. It makes provision to either sentence a person to death or to life imprisonment, for a person who is in possession of three grams of morphine, or two grams of cocaine or two grams of heroin (for personal use). There is little demarcation among drug users, street-level dealers and large-scale traffickers when sentencing for drug related offences. Although this was raised by some law enforcement professionals for over a decade, it has received little attention and political support. 

Implementing the death penalty was raised again following the assassination of a prominent High Court Judge Sarath Ambepitiya and his bodyguard on November 19, 2004. The deaths were suspected of being an order given to the assassins from a major drug trafficker

Majority of those who are addicted to drugs are unfortunate individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds. Similarly, majority of drug users admitted to prison are from lower socio-economic backgrounds who may require treatment and rehabilitation. International evidence and the UNODC suggest that voluntary community-based treatment programmes produce better outcome when compared to coerced or compulsory treatment in prison. At present programmes are implemented in some prisons to rehabilitate drug users. A comprehensive evaluation on the outcomes of the Drug Dependent Persons Treatment and Rehabilitation Act No 54 of 2007 is also overdue. 
The National Dangerous Drug Control Board has conducted a significant amount of work in regards to the drug prevention, treatment and rehabilitation agenda. Building on these achievements, the drug problem needs to be seen and framed as a public health issue.At present, the countrys drug problem has been framed as a matter for the criminal justice system. International evidence clearly demonstrates that drug use disorders are best managed within a public health system. 
One of the primary reasons for maintaining a penal approach to managing drug problems is due to its increasing use as a political tool. While there exists consensus on a tough law enforcement approach to manage drug problems, a debate needs to begin to ensure a public health agenda is incorporated into policy-making. Stakeholders with divergent views, including the knowledge experts whose views on the drug problem had not been heard should be included in this debate so that consensual knowledge on the drug problem expands. 
Attention should be paid to successive shifts in drug policies of other countries, from which Sri Lanka has previously learned and from which the death sentence was copied. For example, Malaysia has moved from solely having harsh punitive measures to include a public health approach. The cessation of compulsory treatment and the establishment of voluntary drug treatment facilities indicate that Malaysias response is beginning to include a health-oriented approach as part of its overall drug policies. There are other policy lessons that can be learned from countries such as Switzerland, Portugal, U.K, Australia and the Netherlands.
Finally, there is no scientific evidence to support the war on drugs.The war on drugs is primarily founded in moralized policy making arenas where political interests have overshadowed the real needs of drug users and their loved ones.
