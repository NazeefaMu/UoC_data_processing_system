EIB Vice President due here
	
Newly appointed European Investment Bank (EIB) Vice President responsible for South Asia, Andrew McDowell is scheduled to arrive in Sri Lanka this evening on a historic visit to explore new opportunities for future investment.
A high-level delegation from the EIB, the worlds largest international public bank, will make the three day official visit to Sri Lanka at the start of a South Asia regional tour.
Vice President McDowell is scheduled to discuss recent engagement and future investment with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and senior government ministers, business leaders, members of the diplomatic community and local and international financial institutions.
He will also inspect ongoing construction work to upgrade wastewater infrastructure in Colombo financed by the EIB in conjunction with the Asian Development Bank (ADB).
Issuing a press release ahead of the Vice Presidents visit, the EIB said the visit represents the first visit of a Bank Vice President to Sri Lanka in more than five years.
The EIBs visit to Sri Lanka builds on the fruitful discussions with Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake following the Banks first ever support for water investment in Sri Lanka and the first loan for public sector investment agreed with the government, Vice President McDowell said before his arrival in Colombo.
Tomorrow, the Delegation is scheduled to visit a number of sites around Colombo to see how new investment is improving the supply of clean water and treatment of waste water in Colombo.
I look forward to seeing at first hand the hard work being done across Colombo to improve water services for inhabitants and discussions with government ministers and other Sri Lankan partners how the EIBs unique global experience can contribute to strengthening new sustainable development and climate related investment across the country, said Vice President McDowell.
In January, the EIB agreed to provide EUR 50 million to support improvement and expansion of sewage networks across the Sri Lankan capital Colombo.
The new water investment programme will include provision of a new sewage network in currently un-served areas of Kirillopone. Under the initiative a new wastewater treatment facility will also be built to reduce pollution at the Wellawata sea outfall.
The ADB will also support the water investment project and this new initiative marks the first time that the EIB has financed a project alongside another International Financial Institution in Sri Lanka.
Meanwhile, Tung-La Margue, EU Ambassador to Sri Lanka and the Maldives said the visit by the EIB is an opportunity for the Sri Lankan Government to showcase their plans for the sustainable development of the country.
I am confident that strengthened engagement by the EIB will lead to new investment across the key sectors that are vital for the modernisation of the country's infrastructure. These investments have the potential to deliver benefits for all Sri Lankans, he said.

Gota rejects Death Squad claims
	
Former Defence Secretary Gothabaya Rajapaksa has rejected news reports published by AL Jazeera and AFP that he operated a death squad with the intention of silencing his critics.
On March 20, foreign news agencies reported that the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) had told the Mt. Lavinia Magistrate's Court that Mr. Rajapaksa led a top secret death squad, targeting journalists and dissidents.
The news report said the alleged unit was also accused of assassinating former Sunday Leader editor Lasantha Wickrematunge.
Sending a letter to AL Jazeera and AFP news through his lawyer on March 23, Mr. Rajapaksa had said the news was a blatant lie because the Police Report did not refer to Mr. Rajapaksa per se.
I have instructed by my client that in any event, no report whatsoever was read out in court implicating my client as mentioned in your news item, Counsel Sanath Wijewardane, the lawyer of Mr. Rajapaksa, said in this letter.
The letter said Mr. Sarath Fonseka, who gave a testimony in connection with the series of incidents, would attempt to divert the attention of the investigation and it was not possible to operate any Army unit and/or deployment without the sanction and/or approval of the Army Commander.
In any event, my client, during the said time period was a civilian and had no direct links to operate any military or other deployment. Therefore, Im instructed by my client to write to you demanding an immediate correction of the distorted and false publication carried out by you, the letter said.
Meanwhile, MP Udaya Gammanpila, who also released the letter to media during a news conference today, said legal action against such fake news would be considered and taken in the event a correction was not made by the respective news publishers. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

HNB opens new St. Josephs College student savings unit
	

Continuing in its pioneering efforts to inculcate the savings habit in children, Sri Lankas premiere private sector commercial bank, hatton national Bank PLC (HNB) announced the opening of a new student savings unit at St. Josephs College, Colombo.
Timed to follow the recent celebrations of the schools 121st anniversary, the new unit was declared open by St. Josephs College Rector Rev. Fr. Travis Gabriel together with prominent past pupil of the school and HNB Managing Director/CEO Jonathan Alles.
Addressing a gathering of students and teachers, Alles said, It is my distinct pleasure to be here with you all today to celebrate the 121st anniversary of this prestigious school and the establishment of HNBs student savings unit at St. Josephs College. HNB was first established in 1888, nine years before St. Josephs, hence this new partnership is constituted of two of Sri Lankas oldest and most respected institutions.Our primary goal with this unit is to help students to gain a better understanding of how to save and the importance of saving so that when you need to fund your higher education or make other important investments, you can do so without stressing your parents.
We will also augment this unit with unique technology so that all transactions will be carried out digitally. This will assist you as you progress in a digital world that is driven by automation. We sincerely hope that this early experience will go a long way towards securing a prosperous future for all of you.
Student savings units were first introduced to the Sri Lankan banking landscape by HNB in 1994. Since then, the bank has expanded its service to cover 153 students savings units across Sri Lanka. Through the units, student managers are groomed to take leadership in running a mini bank in school and get actively involved in promoting the savings habit among fellow students. The bank trains over 1,000 students annually in this capacity.

Former minister Mervyn Silva said yesterday he hoped to launch a new political party which would be open for politicians who had faced injustice because of the actions of their political parties or leaders.
If someone has had to face injustice like what happened to me, I invite them to join us. I thought of forming the party not for me but for those who faced injustices for political reasons. I will not the leader of the party. I will be the chairman. We will appoint an educated youth leader for the party, he said.
Mr. Silva said even he did not know whether he was in the SLFP and added that he respected the UNP where everyone was treated equally without any hatred.

Pan Asia Bank unveils new banking platform
	
In todays context, people are constantly looking for fast, convenient and easy means to conduct business in order to save time. In such cases, the Internet has become a platform that many turn to, largely due to its accessibility at any given location, at any given time.
Making use of the ease that the Internet gives, Pan Asia Bank, Sri Lankas fastest growing commercial bank, recently launched an Internet banking solution platform that users can access from any location 24/7, 365 days a year.
Pan Asia Bank Chief Information Officer Aruna Rathugamage spoke with us about the new Internet platform, its uses and other details.
Following are the excerpts from the interview.
First of all, can you tell me why online banking has become such a vital component on banking
The way I see it, first of all, is that it has become a de facto standard; every bank offers online banking and we cant go without it. And the other thing is that people dont have time to go to a bank. You also need access to your money 24/7, you dont have time to go and stand in a queue.
I see several stages in the evolution of banking. In the past, going to the bank was a long process where you have to get a number and eventually your name gets called and you go and sign and get the money. And then came the ATM and the bank came halfway to meet you. The third stage is where the bank is actually coming to your home with online banking. The fourth stage is cognitive banking, where the bank is actually ahead of you. The bank knows what you need next. That is how the banking is keeping up with the times and in that context online banking is a necessity.

Where does your new Internet platform come into this
The new Internet banking is a state-of-the-art platform, which is highly advanced. It also uses very little data which addresses one of the major issues when you access the Internet on your phone. This is built on Ajax technology so that means when you refresh the page, it wont refresh the whole page, only the changed items. This enables us not to burn the data bill of our customers unnecessarily.

What are the features that this platform offers to the user
We have formed tie ups with quite a number of service providers so that you can pay your bills via the platform. Then we have included the cross bank money transfer and within seconds the money gets transferred. Whats more security wise, we give a One Time Password (OTP) when you are about to make a payment or adding a beneficiary. You also get a feature where you can create shortcuts to the functions you use often, if you are doing bill payment all the time, you can save it on the home page so that you dont have to go looking for it every time.

How will this platform help you with the digital disruption that is taking off across many fields
All our new IT developments including the new Internet banking and mobile app are built on an architecture, where we use micro services and APIs, which means you can compose and give novel and innovative functionality with minimal time to market.

Is it compatible with any device
Yes, basically we use what we call adaptive or responsive technology. It changes the format to the device it uses. In your web browser of your computer, you will have a different format but when you use it on your mobile phones web browser, the site stacks all the elements one below the other, rather than cutting and compressing it. The platform is responsive to any device so there is no hassle to find what you want.

Is there a separate app as well
Yes, you can download the app from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store for Android. The app offers the same features.

What can you say about your existing corporate web portal
That is again, state-of-the-art. It too is responsive and adapts formatting to fit any device. Through research, we have found that people dont read websites, they rather browse them. So using that knowledge, we have designed the portal so that the user can find what they want very easily, its compact and precise, not at all cluttered.

Can you also speak about the banks future
We have progressed quite rapidly in the recent past. For three years we were voted the fastest growing commercial bank and we plan to continue aggressively in that direction using both the branch network and the online services.
We are also hoping to expand our branch network, which is at 82 now. We are also going to employ the digital channels to reach more customers.

Rajinikanth cancelled SL visit due to political lies: Organisers
	
The Gnanam Foundation which built 150 homes for Tamils in Jaffna has said the decision of Kollywood Star Rajinikanth to cancel his visit to Sri Lanka to unveil the houses was an outcome of politicians acting on lies and rumours
According to India Today, Gnanam; the NGO owned by Lyca, has released a discreet statement stating that the event was scheduled to provide 150 homes to war torn Tamil families from Vavuniya.
"An event to hand over the deeds of the newly built houses to the 150 families was going to be held on April 9 in Jaffna. Superstar Rajinikanth was invited to take part in this momentous charity and he readily agreed," said the statement.
Rajinikanth had agreed to visit Mullaitivu, Kilinochchi, Vavuniya, Mannar, Triconamalee and Batticaloa which were all LTTE strongholds earlier.
He had specifically mentioned that he wished to visit the place where the 'holy war' occurred and it was not right to politicise it.
Lyca's Gnanam foundation regretfully expressed that they do not want the superstar to be subjected to any uncomfortable and embarrassing situation.
Lyca also wanted to make it clear that many baseless rumours are being spread by business competitors regarding relationship with Rajapaksa and called these rumours untrue and unfounded.
"The actions of some Tamil Nadu politicians who repeatedly speak out in support of those who are attempting to gain petty advantage by spreading rumours like these should be condemned," said Gnanam foundation.
Lyca's Gnanam foundation also alleged that these politicians did nothing to alleviate the suffering and hardship of the people affected by the war.
However, Lyca did not answer the major claim by the Tamil politicians who are raising the concerns of their Eelam counterparts seeking the army to return the occupied Tamil lands.

## Title: Reclaiming road rights - Roads belong to pedestrians too
## Section: News Features

Reclaiming road rights - Roads belong to pedestrians too
	
Pedestrians and their rights are not talked about or taken into consideration in this country. In most urban environments, the pavement and pedestrian area looks neglected and not properly maintained. In these areas, there are lamp posts, billboards and other installations which disturb and distract pedestrians. In an attempt to identify the present situation and rights of pedestrians in Sri Lanka, the Daily Mirror approached experts in relevant fields. We asked the question, to whom does the road belong to; pedestrians or motorists and they commented as following.
Humans are like frightened animals squeezed between vehicles in a vehicle-dominated city, he commented. Pedestrian must be sheltered properly, especially in a tropical country, and there must be a proper landscape. The pedestrian area is not a respected zone here. Even bus shelters are badly designed and not properly located. Pedestrian movement and vehicular movement must be safely separated by vegetation, or a line of trees. The front of the bus shelter should be covered, not the back, so that people cant jump into vehicles. Now it is totally open from the roadside and blocked from the back, and that is wrong. 
Commenting on the mistakes in city planning and design he said; These are not designs, theyre just haphazard placements done by someone who doesnt know anything about people and simple human behaviour. When people are not respected, they vandalize the city. They kick and break everything around them. They should be respected and integrated into society more than vehicles. Vehicles are respected more than people. This is not a humane city, is an animalistic city. 
He then pointed out examples of poor placement and planning in cities: People are stuck in traffic between Fort railway station and the Pettah bus stand on both sides, because people carry heavy luggage from the station to the bus stand. The vehicle system and pedestrian system should be integrated together, in a meaningful way. If these two busy areas were properly placed, this unwanted traffic wont be created. 
He said there are pedestrian streets (pedestrian malls) in some countries that had no vehicles, allowing people to move freely. Internal shopping areas are totally independent. Vehicles should be taken out and hidden, as soon as they exit the road. Even though vehicles move in a linear way, people cannot walk like that, because their biological movement is very rhythmic, kind of a zig-zag pattern.  He emphasized on the importance of not having buildings in every corner of the city and the existence of windows in the cityscape. The government should have a vision of creating a people-friendly city; but in the name of development, they are wasting a large sum of money redoing pavements and other patchworks, he pointed out. 
At the same time, the short shrub-like bougainvillea are planted near roads and they absorb the poisonous gas emanating from internal combustion engines. These vehicles should not be allowed to be driven all over the city. 
Commenting on what is practical, he commented that such a vision was definitely practical even in Colombo city. 
If they allow me to plan the city, I will show them how well it can be done. All third-world countries are giving priority to vehicles, while western countries are opting for green and organic concepts. In Germany, they are trying to create a cycling-only city, he added. 
What we have today is a deformed and ugly city, because the structure is wrong. Everything is interconnected and when something is wrong, everything else is also wrong. Therefore, this whole system should be changed.
In the last 8 years, we have made and improved many foot walks/pavements in the city. Nearly 50km of foot walks have been improved with paving. We have also managed to remove most houses that were along foot walks. In my opinion, foot walks are now in good condition, said Jayantha Guruge, Former Director of Engineering Works, retired from the CMC. 
Mr. Guruge further explained why many byroads did not have foot walks You cannot place foot walks everywhere. Some roads are not wide enough. Because we have to take two traffic lanes into consideration, the road needs to be at least 7.5 metres. To accommodate a foot walk, we should have at least a 1.5m space. Most roads are not sufficiently wide to have one because of two lanes of traffic. This is the reason why most byroads do not have foot walks. If you are going to acquire land and construct a foot walk, it is a very costly affair. 


"There is also a large number of accidents, particularly involving pedestrians and cyclists. This is the price we are paying for poor quality design"

You have to accommodate many things on a foot walk, such as lampposts and road signs. Sometimes lampposts and road signs may be placed in the middle of the foot walk. If it is 1.5m, we cannot place the lamppost at the edge of the pavement. We have to keep it at least 1 1/2ft away from the edge of the pavement. In a 1.5m foot walk if you leave about 450 mm for the lamppost, it ends up right in the middle. If you build the lamppost at the edge of the foot walk, the lamppost will damage vehicles. If the design is standard, we cannot accommodate everything on the foot walk. We have to accommodate lampposts and traffic signs on the footwalk. This is all for the safety of the pedestrian, he said. 
Speaking of the distance between crossings and the bus halt, Mr. Guruge said, For zebra crossings, there is a standard design, as we generally put about 450m or 500m between the crossings. Otherwise, we have to consider the need for pedestrian crossings. If there is a demand for this, you can have pedestrian crossings anywhere, otherwise we have them at a 450m distance. 
Bus halts also have a standard design- they are usually at a 500m distance from each other. Bus halts too are put up due to the demand, otherwise we have a standard distance between them. First we plan according to the standard, then through the demand. If there is a demand, we construct the bus halts where they are needed. At the main interception or junction, there has to be a bus halt. Otherwise we go by the standard. Demand is seen in areas that have a market or a railway station, schools, universities, hospitals and supermarkets.
According to Prof. Amal Kumarage, Senior Professor at the Department of Transport and Logistics Management, University of Moratuwa: The bottom line is that all advanced cities have facilities for pedestrians, while poorly planned cities deny them rights. I think the term pavement is a very poor definition of the facilities that have been given to pedestrians. Pedestrians must have walkways, not an edge of the road. Now walking is considered a wholesome activity which is good for your health and essential for social interactions. 
Many cities provide walking facilities before providing anything else in other forms of mobility. In terms of developed countries and those which have a high quality of life, you will find pedestrian pathways, walkways, bicycle ways, bus ways and zones that are highly accessible to people. Vehicles will be at the lowest end of the priorities. So, Sri Lanka is still moving in the opposite direction, where we think private vehicles are the most important. Thus, we keep lining roads and acquiring facilities from what is available to pedestrians, buses and cyclists. We dont provide adequate space or facilities for them and I think we are now reaping the consequences of this by way of an enormous amount of congestion, which is costing the economy billions in repairing roads and pavements.


"You cannot place foot walks everywhere. Some roads are not wide enough. Because we have to take two traffic lanes into consideration, the road needs to be at least 7.5 metres"

There is also a large number of accidents, particularly involving pedestrians and cyclists. This is the price we are paying for poor quality design. As long as we continue this, we will not be able to rise above the present situation. I still havent seen a reversal of this and I think this is where we are now. 
Speaking of pedestrian discipline, Prof. Kumarage said: There are two sides to the coin. If you dont provide facilities for pedestrians, they will walk wherever they can. Just like motorists will drive all over the place without sticking to a lane, pedestrians dont stick to the correct side of the road. So, I dont think this is the fault of pedestrians alone. It is typical of Sri Lankans. We dont adhere to rules, signs or markings on a road whether we are pedestrians, motorists or bus drivers. Many people will blame bus drivers, three wheeler drivers or pedestrians; but motorists dont observe rules either. They drive on different lanes and dont stop at pedestrian crossings or honour traffic signals. This is because we pay very little consideration to road rules and such.

Sri Lanka holds world cup for university ragging
	
Torture; mental, physical and sexual in our universities is disguised as ragging. And it is advancing in perversity and planning. The latest is a torture house on rent. Are these raggers, carrying sacks of bricks on their shoulders, the ones who are going to take the country forward politicians keep yapping about Up to now, government intervention has been only air and fiddle in correcting a situation that is a disgrace to the country.

Engrossed in the Daily Dodger newspaper after breakfast, Shelton Perera, the proprietor of the Wallside Restaurant and Bar observed, Cha, cha, this university ragging has really gone out of control. 
But arent there university rules and government rules regarding the inhuman university ragging we keep hearing about And what about university security and the police asked Sheltons wife Joy sipping a cup of tea. 
Sir Donald the rag master
Inhuman, thats the right word for our university style of ragging, Darlo. We too had ragging but that was mild get-to-know-each-other things that never hurt anybody; not the animalistic varieties we hear about now. (Shelton Perera was an Arts graduate from the University of Peradeniya). Oh yes, I remember those days when Donald the rag master headed the rag team. We had to address him as Sir Donald. It was funny when you think of those days, Shelton laughed. As a hosteler and a fresher I had to endure some ragging during rag weeks. The ragging involved singing a song on demand, wearing a torn shirt and a tie when attending lectures, not shaving or shaving half the beard, offering flowers to girl students, making proposals of marriage to the plainest girl in the batch, buying tea and cigarettes for everyone in the rag team at the canteen, washing seniors clothes and polishing their shoes with or without polish and things like that. They were not inhuman by any stretch of imagination. But I found the morning drill uncomfortable. 
Morning drill; what on earth for Shelley 
That was the only mass ragging we had. Early in the morning freshmen in their underwear had to line up in the compound outside our hall and wait for commands to begin a drill.. I remember it was very cold and misty. After making us freeze awhile, the rag leader, Sir Donald appears on the balcony wearing a towel which he used to whip off before yelling Hail the Lord! thrice and each time we had be bow down in acknowledgment. After that he shouts commands for exercises. Heels raise, knees bend, touch your toes, raise arms, bend left, bend right you know school-day stuff. The duration of the drill depended on how cold Sir Donald in his birthday suit felt. 
Must have been a fine sight, giggled Joy. 
Sexual perversity
It was, but such rags built a good sense of comradeship among juniors and seniors. Sir Donald and his rag team turned out to be OK guys in university. Many did very well in Civil Service and corporate sector. Girls too ragged juniors. I dont know what went on in their halls, but I heard some were asked to hang brinjals round their necks, crawl on their knees, sing songs, write love letters to a male student she liked; things like that. But over the years ragging has changed and made hell for university entrants. It has turned so bad its on record that thousands of students chucked up university and had gone home; they couldnt stand the ragging. So, they lost higher education and careers. About a dozen had died, some were disabled for life and a few others have committed suicide. Their parents and families must have undergone the terrible shock of losing someone dear to them because of sick ragging. 
Good heavens, cant something be done about such madness cried Joy. 
What do you expect Mrs Shelton It was Tommo a pussycat employed as a vermin controller in Shelton Pereras business that purred a response. What indeed, hooted pussys pal and working companion Ooty, an owl. Mrs Shelton sounds somewhat out of date, doesnt she The two pals were hanging around the dining room of the Perera house that morning. 
Meeoowwohsure (Oh sure). Do you know this country takes first place in the world for university ragging Not just raging but dirty, psycho ragging by young pups just out of school who rag other pups junior to them in university. What the media has reported is nothing when compared to some outlandish ragging episodes that make ordinary governors wonder whether the rag mongers were all there; the ragging had been of a brutal sexual nature. Just imagine the trauma of those who bore the brunt of such lunacy. They would be scarred for life. 


"Over the years ragging has changed and made hell for university entrants. It has turned so bad thousands of students have chucked up university and had gone home; they couldnt stand the ragging"

The exclaimed the owl, Oh my gosh! 
Ill give an example hissed pussy. Some sick seniors had held a lighted candle under a freshers things testicles. The victim went sterile and remained sterile; he couldnt even return home because of the shame. The case went to courts but a top lawyer appeared for the raggers and they won. There have been several cases of severe sexual abuse amounting to homosexual acts that included sodomy. And not only male freshers had been victims; even new female students had suffered sexual deviations. University ragging has become a sex fiesta. 
Has anyone explained why university students get sadistic sex perverts when they see fresh faces in campuses The bird raised a pertinent question. 
Ha-ha-haaaa, pussy laughed the way pussies do. Heaps of governors have put forward theory after theory. Then there are reels of anti-ragging laws, anti-ragging set-ups and even an anti ragging Act of Parliament. But ragging goes on like wild fire. 
You mean it cant be stopped The bird hooted inquiringly. 
No, not yet. And its getting alarmingly sicker. Recently raggers had the gall to rent a house especially for ragging. I can think of one major reason for this type of ragging: inferiority complexes. In university students of lower-income classes make use of their position to take revenge from fellows from well-to-do higher classes. The howls against privatized higher education spring from a platform of plain economics. Hostility, thoughts of revenge and jealousy that burned in pre-university days come out flaming in universities when large numbers of low-income students strengthen ragging. So as far as I can see the ragging sickness will continue despite the taboos. 
Hooot! Thats not a happy situ at all. 
Out- of- university ragging
There is another thing, purred pussy. Young governors who enter universities are the best brains of the country. After they pass out, they would end up as docs, lawyers, teachers, lecturers, and other professionals, managers and administrators in public service, the private sector and in politics. You can clearly see the deterioration of these groups from those days to these days.  But, compared to these days lots, Sir Donald types of those days were angels. Our governors are now saddled with these days types who as public figures are ragging governors even in their imagination. Think of the demeanor of the majority of government employees from top to bottom; youll get the idea. Some politiccas, graduates, are also in this sick-in-the head these days lot. Together they rag our governors painfully, shamefully and relentlessly; they carry sacks of chips on their shoulders. 
Only a Yama remedy would work
Whoooom. So whats the answer 
Purshsh! No Yaha style administration can handle this university hydrophobia 
Thuhooom; then who and how 
My grandpa who was the boss of our pussy clan, was a strong believer of unorthodox answers to chronic gang wars, collection of protection money and ant type of extreme pussy style ragging. And his approach worked. 
Huh, what did he do 
As a copycat of our governors, grandpa copied the Yama approach of a Yama government during his time. So, whenever any pussy or a gang of pussies were found doing perverted things like our governors ragging thingy, he used his hatchet teams to scratch and bite them beyond recognition, jail ring leaders on diets of water and bread in secret hideouts until the meowed, Enough enough, Oh King Tom, we promise to be good pussies from now on. You see, by that time they were hallucinating, explained pussy. Grandpa also went to an extreme: he made incorrigible pussies disappear with all nine lives. 
Hoot, and his methods worked, aah 
Purrrr. Of course, but then he lost the next election to a moderate.

We didnt ask Rajinikanth to cancel SL visit: TN politicians
	
Refuting Lyca Productions charges, Tamil Nadu political parties had said their motive was not to oppose Rajinikanths visit to Sri Lanka but only asked him to reconsider his trip since the atmosphere was not conducive, Deccan Chronicle reported on Monday. 
Our motive is not to oppose Rajinikanth or Lyca or seek publicity. If Lyca thinks so, it is sheer imagination, Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) leader Thol Thirumavalavan has said while appreciating the superstar for his maturity in understanding the issue in the right context.
He said it was laughable if one believes opposing Rajinikanths Sri Lanka visit or an anti-Lyca stand will endear people to them.
In fact, the fear of Tamils in the Northern Province is that the Sinhala rulers are trying to derive political mileage out of the issue, he said in a statement.
Meanwhile, Tamizhaga Vazhvurimai Katchi TVK leader Velmurugan denied he was raking up the issue for publicity.
We had requested Rajinikanth through a close friend, asking him to not to attend the event as it would be politicised by the Lankan government for its own advantage. We never had anything to do with Lyca, he said.
However, Union minister of state for road transport, highways and shipping Pon Radhakrishnan said the actor should have gone to Lanka to hand over the houses to the Tamils there. 
BJP state president Dr Tamilisai Soundararajan speaking in similar vein had said that the superstar could have undertaken the visit to Sri Lanka as it was meant to give away houses to the Lankan Tamils
The actor on Saturday announced the cancelation of his visit in the wake of calls by political parties.
