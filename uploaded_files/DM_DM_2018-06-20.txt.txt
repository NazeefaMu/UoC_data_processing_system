A letter that sent them into a flutter
	

A document that passed from hand to hand among the Green backbenchers last week left most of them shocked and baffled, they say.

The document was a copy of a letter of warning issued to the rebel female Diyawanna member for berating the party leader.
After reading the warning letter, most members had shared the view that there was no sense in being expelled from the party by antagonizing the party leader and some of them had made it a point to lose no time in collecting their monitoring appointments from the Ministries concerned.
However, the rebel duo from Badulla and Ratnapura continue to remain defiant and is determined to carry on their struggle for the democratization of the party come hell or high water, they say.

A strange tie-up raises eyebrows
	

A recent rendezvous between a radical Diyawanna member from the North and a prominent public figure having ties with the opposition has raised a big question mark in political circles these days, they say.

The reason why the reported tryst has raised many eyebrows is that this public figure who once played a lead role against the separatist forces was a target of frequent verbal attacks by this radical from the main alliance in the North apart from the seeming impossibility of their having a common ground in politics or any other sphere for that matter.
By the way, reports from the North say that this radical has now fallen from grace of certain powerful bigwigs in the main alliance mainly because of his close ties with the provincial chief there.
Whys and wherefores about this strange meeting, however, are still a mystery, they say.

An appeal in vain
	

It was about three or four weeks ago that the Green party bigwigs had approved the list of six backbenchers for the deputy and state level posts. The party secretary had prepared this list considering the seniority and the overall performance of the aspirants.

This list had been finalized by the time the Green leader was to take wing on an official tour abroad. Meanwhile, Mariks from Kolonnawa who learnt that his name was not among the latest lucky six, had called the Green leader to express his disappointment over being overlooked despite his success in retaining the constituency as a strong party stronghold against heavy odds.
The Green boss had replied that the list had already been finalized by that time adding that the right person would get the right place.
Mariks had to be satisfied with this reply, they say.

An exclusive interview with Otara Gunewardene
	
Otara Gunewardene had opportunities to share her experience as an entrepreneur, businesswoman and advocateat three different world forums over the past few months. Here she speaks about what it was and how it felt to be part of a global initiative.
Q: You were invited to several international forums recently where you had an opportunity to represent Sri Lanka and speak in knowledge sharing panels. What were these forums
A: Yes, there were three that took place recently. The Global Entrepreneurship Summit (GES) was held in Hyderabad, India under the theme Women First, Prosperity for All. There were over 1500 global entrepreneurs and investors who gathered and it was indeed a privilege to be a part of it. It was hosted by the United States of America and the Republic of India. Therefore the forum was inaugurated by Indias Prime Minister HE Narendra Modi and the US delegation was led by Ivanka Trump.
Following that I got an opportunity to speak at the Inaugural Womens Forum The Power of Half a Billion, which was jointly presented by Economic Times and Facebook. This was in Mumbai and had around 50 international speakers and over 500 participants.
The other invitation was from the Ladies Study Group for their conference, Shakti Beyond Borders. It was a platform to celebrate success stories of women from the 6 SAARC countrieswho have made significant contributions to their country in different fields.
Overall, the 3 forums were key to the South Asian region as they created a platform for like-minded advocates to come together, discuss, debate and lead innovative initiatives in their focused areas.
Q: How did it feel to be part of these international forums
A: It was a privilege to be at these events, especially amidstentrepreneurs who have made their global mark at the GES. It was also a pleasure to represent Sri Lanka together with entrepreneur Merrill J. Fernando who also joined the event. The knowledge and experience that was shared in all these forums led to a wider understanding of the kind of opportunities and challenges we have, some are common and others are unique to each country. However, the outlining fact was that change is happening and a lot of focus is being given to encourage more women entrepreneurs across the world.
Q: What was your contribution at each of these events
A: At the Global Entrepreneurship Summit, I was part of the discussion named Grassroots Grow: Women in emerging Markets, in which we spoke about how each one of us successfully secured new opportunities in emerging markets, the cultural opportunities and challenges faced by entrepreneurs who are scaling businesses in South Asia. The overall summit was focused on empowering innovators, especially women, to take their ideas to the next level.
The Economic Times Womens Forum focused on over 12 areas such as gender diversity, enhancing womens participation in the workforce, breaking the proverbial glass ceiling, women in sports, start-ups, civic society and performing arts. As a result, it was a gathering of women with achievements in different areas which included Olympic medalists, Heads of Start-ups, Bollywood directors and combat pilots. The panel I spoke in was named Neighbors Beating Gender Bias and on the panel were Sarah Ali from Bangladesh who is the Managing Director of Bitopi Advertising Limited, and FawziaKoofi  Afghan politician and womens rights activist. It was moderated by SagarikaGhose, Consulting Editor of the Times of India.
AtShakti Beyond Bordersthe participants highlighted their experiences and emphasized the fact that the most important thing for women across generations and borders is to stand by each other and help each grow as individuals and professionals. The key focus area was how economic empowerment of more women can build economies, making countries stronger.
Q: Can you share a few memorable moments you had, and key figures you met
A: The GES was one of the biggest summits I have attended. The fact that it was hosted by the governments of India and the USA meant that we were able to meet the Prime Minister of India himself, HE Narendra Modi. In addition, it was a privilege to meet powerful women like Cherie Blair and Chanda Kochhar  CEO of ICICI Bank and manysuccessful entrepreneurs and business leaders. A few of us were invited for a special dinner with the Prime Minister and Ivanka Trump at the Taj Falaknuma Palace, which was a very special experience.
At the ET Womens Forum, I had the opportunity to meet women such as Andrea Jung  the longest tenure female Fortune 500 CEO. These people continue to inspire more and more women to believe in their strengths, and encourage others to believe in their dreams.

Aversion to an unusual perversion
	

There is a Diyawanna member at deputy level who often mimics film actors. What is more unusual about him is that he has made it his pastime to whisper to the young female members the juicy details from the private life of other Diyawanna ones.

He also takes pleasure in discussing with the fair members the feminine body curves and contours, they say.
Most female members who have long tolerated him out of common courtesy, now openly express their aversion to his behavior and some of them say that the man would soon learn a good lesson from one of them.

Chinese Company pays final tranche of Htota Port deal
	
The final tranche of investment value for Hambantota Port concession was released by China Merchant Port Holdings Limited (CM Port) today, the Ministry of Ports and Shipping said in a statement.
It said the cheque to the effect was handed over to SLPA Chairman Dr.Parakrama Dissanayake by the Chief Representative of China Merchant Group in Sri Lanka - Mr.Ray Ren in the presence of senior port officials and representatives of CM Port. 
This makes the single highest ever Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) received by Sri Lanka to date, the Ports Authority said.
This third final tranche in the amount of US $ 584,194,800 follows the 1st, a 2nd tranches released in December last year and January 2018, in amounts US $ 292 million and US $ 97 million. With this payment, CM Port fulfils the US $ 976 million investment value 1 of the port concession and in terms of the Concession Agreement, CM Port has agreed to deposit a further sum of US $ 146 million being investment value 2 to be utilized for port and marine related activities.
In view of urgent need for viable and efficient operation of the Port of Hambantota, on the direction and leadership of the Hon. Minister of Ports and Shipping Mahinda Samarasinghe under the guidance of His Excellency the President and Prime Minister, Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) and the Government of Sri Lanka entered into the Concession Agreement with China Merchant Port Holdings Limited of Hong Kong in July last year for management, operation and development of Hambantota Port on Public Private Partnership model.
On December 9 last year two Sri Lankan companies established under the concession agreement namely, Hambantota International Port Group (HIPG) and Hambantota International Port Services Co. (Pvt) Ltd. (HIPS) officially took over the Hambantota Port thereby making the concluded concession agreement effective.
CM Port is one of the most successful global companies in the ports sector, and their investment in the Port of Hambantota can be described as a credible vote of confidence in its potential as well as in the economy of Sri Lanka, said Parakrama Dissanayake  Chairman SLPA.
The two companies established in Hambantota plans further to invest an additional US$ 400 million to US$ 600 million on phase I and II of the Hambantota Port. These investments will attract many other foreign investors to the country, making Sri Lanka a pivotal maritime and Logistics Centre.
During the year 2017, Port of Colombo was ranked as the 23rd largest Container Port and 13th best-connected Port in the world. SLPA also recorded a Net Profit of Rs 13.2 Billion in 2017, as against a Net Profit of Rs 1 Billion achieved in 2016. With transhipment volumes in the Port of Colombo during the first 05 months of 2018 as against 2017 increasing by 19.2% and Jaya Container Terminal managed by SLPA recording a transhipment growth of 21% during the aforesaid period, the conclusion of the Concession Agreement of Hambantota Port would further enhance the profitability of SLPA.

Compensating ex-LTTE combatants: People should stop paying taxes: JO
	
The joint opposition said today people should stop paying taxes to the government, if it continues with its move to pay compensation to ex-LTTE combatants.
JO member and MP Wimal Weerawansa told a news conference that no country in the world had ever paid compensation to ex-terrorists unlike what Sri Lanka was attempting to do and added that such moves would not contribute towards reconciliation.
He said the government was hoping to pay compensation to ex-LTTE combatants by using tax payers money saying Sri Lanka will be the first in the world to pay compensation to terrorists.
The compensation will not be paid by using the money of government bigwigs. Compensation has still not been paid to the victims of the Meethotamulla garbage dump tragedy and the explosion at the army camp at Salawa. Then, why is the government trying to compensate terrorists who tried to destroy our country, the MP asked. If the government is attempting to compensate the terrorists who struggled for Tamil Eelam, we are forced to consider the President and the Prime Minister as separatists.
Meanwhile, MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage said this proposal which had been made to the Cabinet was not a proposal made by Minister D.M. Swaminathan on his own, but a proposal made by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in an attempt to gain more votes from the Northern people at the upcoming presidential election.

Compensation to war-affected: New Cabinet memo submitted
	
A fresh Cabinet memorandum seeking to grant compensation to war affected people including ex-LTTE combatants was reported to have been submitted yesterday.
Sources said, the Cabinet withheld its approval for this compensation formula till the establishment of the reparation office after enacting necessary legislation.
This is the third time this Cabinet paper was submitted. It was first submitted last year. But, the move was shelved amid widespread objections to the inclusion of ex-LTTE combatants.
Resettlement and Rehabilitation Minister D.M. Swaminathan submitted it again last week but met with similar resistance on that occasion as well.
The memo was taken up for discussion yesterday when Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka had reportedly raised objections.
Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera is reported to have said that compensation could be paid only through the reparation office after it was set up. (Kelum Bandara)

## Title: DUDLEY SENANAYAKE
## Section: News Features
## Date: 20 June 2018 12:00 am
DUDLEY SENANAYAKE
	


The Sri Lankan Statesman Dudley Shelton Senanayake, whose 107th Birth Anniversary falls on Tuesday, June 19, 2018 was one of the noblest sons of the soil. He was born in the village of Bo-thale, the meaning of which is the village of the Bo-Sapling, in Mirigama in the Gampaha District.
Born on June 19, 1911, he was a brilliant, genuine and compassionate character. Incidentally June 19, 1911 was also a Poson Poya day, the day that the land owned by the Senanayake family was ceremonially offered to the village temple.
Dudley, was the eldest son of the majestic personality Father of the Nation late D.S. Senanayake, the First Prime Minister of Ceylon and Molly Senanayake. His younger brother was late Robert Senanayake. But of the two, Dudley was lively, and much active as a schoolboy. Both of them, studied at S. Thomas College, Mount Lavinia, the leading Anglican school in Sri Lanka where his illustrious father DS Senanayake had also studied from 1882 to 1902. All three of them, played cricket for S.Thomas College, with distinction. Dudley became the Head Prefect, captained the college team at cricket at the Royal-Thomian encounter and gained colours in Hockey, Boxing, and Athletics. He then went on to Cambridge, Coerpus Christi College to read for Natural Sciences and later was admitted to Middle Temple as a Barrister.
The most admirable thing was the quickness of perception and the way in which he was able to master a subject was outstanding, and unbelievable. After returning to Ceylon, Dudley was elected to the vacant seat of Dedigama as a member of the State Council while his father was Minister of Agriculture and served as a backbencher for 10 years. He succeeded his father as Minister of Agriculture in 1946 and held the post after Independence. He was still serving as agriculture minister when his father died unexpectedly. Four days later, on March 26, 1952, to the surprise of many, Dudley was chosen as Prime Minister by the Governor General Lord Soulbury over his cousin Sir John Kotelawala.
He called a general election, which the UNP won. The government became unpopular a year later, in 1953, when the price of rice was raised and subsidies were cut. Though the UNP remained in power, Dudley resigned as Prime Minister during the hartal 1953 and left politics. This shows his kindness and sympathetic mentality and feeling towards issues related to ordinary public.

Anyone who knew late Dudley, was aware that he was a true liberal democrat, who chose only the democratic way to gain power through free and fair elections

He returned to politics in 1957 when the UNP lost elections. In March 1960, the UNP managed to form a government after elections and Dudley became the Prime Minister again, but the coalition fragmented and he resigned after only four months in office after fresh elections were held in which the UNP had won fewer seats. He became the Leader of the opposition and helped force early elections in 1965 by persuading 14 supporters of Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike to defeat.
The Gal-Oya scheme, the countrys first multi-purpose project for the transition to mechanized agriculture, was Dudleys brainchild. His unchallenged integrity ensured that there were absolutely no allegations of corruption leveled at him. Gal-oya flowed where it had to flow and not into private companies. One recalls his simplicity today, when even as Prime Minister, he would drive his little Triumph Herald. The scenario today, with an elephantine sized cabinet, has several vehicles and security accompanying the occupants and their families. Dudley had a great sense of vision and mission and shunned pomp and pageantry. He was never guilty of double standards in any situation.
His transparent honesty of purpose and high honour was always maintained in the rich tapestry of his life. A modest man and a gentleman to his fingertips, he was an accomplished parliamentarian; his interventions in debate were always studied and polished. The great man who was elected by the people taught another great lesson to all politicians by resigning from the post of Prime Minister, the leadership of the UNP and politics altogether.

Every time he came to power, his priority and commitment was to uplift Agriculture as he believed it gives fundamental development drive

Dudley Senanayake served his longest term as prime minister from March 1965 to May 1970. His government originally consisted of six other parties and included both Tamil and Sinhalese nationalists. His government has been credited with restoring the Sri Lankan economy. He and his allies were defeated in the 1970 elections. He remained active in politics until his death, which occurred after a brief illness on April 13, 1973.
In every time he came to power, his priority and main commitment was to uplift Agriculture as he believed that the agriculture gives fundamental development drive for a country like Sri Lanka. He was a firm believer in democratic practices, free and fair elections, freedom of expression, respect for human rights and the independence of the Judiciary etc. In terms of economic policy, he believed in growth but not at the expense of social justice. He believed that if the poor are to participate in development, they have to be strengthened first - the landless had to be given land and government assistance to become independent. Dudley was almost helpless as the main lifeline of the country the plantations were in serious decline.
Then he struck upon the idea of reviving the economy by an upsurge in domestic agriculture. Agricultural colonization schemes were DS Senanayekes pet projects. The cultivators Premier Dudley revived that interest in domestic agriculture with the inauguration of the food production drive and the green revolution. He met with unexpected success in this regard and it can safely be said that Dudley Senanayakes food production drive in the late sixties was the most successful medium term economic plan ever to be implemented in this country. Rice production alone doubled in just four years. Like his father, Dudley believed that the Nations well being is linked to food security, and he travelled the length and breadth of Sri Lanka to provide the proper impetus to agriculture. Mahaweli diversion was a massive irrigation feat inaugurated during his time by laying foundation to the Polgolla reservoir. But before its completion his Government was defeated at the 1970 elections.
Anyone who knew or worked with the late Dudley, was aware that he was a true liberal democrat, who would never tread any other path than that of the democratic way, through free and fair elections to gain power. He never made false promises to gain power, and was known to always speak the truth. He was a man above all others, in every sense of the term. Both he and his father, the late DS Senanayake, the father of the Nation, have always stood for an united country, where all our citizens are treated as equal citizens, irrespective of community. This is what the very name of the United National Party stands for. Sometime ago, TULF Parliamentarian V. Anandasangaree said at a meeting that the country wouldnt have faced all the problems that we had, if DS and Dudleys policies had been followed to the letter. Dudley was an avowed believer that public funds should not be utilized for the private use of a public official. Throughout his tenure as Prime Minister, he resided at his private residence and insisted that all expenses incurred in his private residence must be financed by his private funds. As Prime Minister, he once travelled to the United States and to the United Kingdom for medical reasons but that all expenses that incurred were met by him and the expenses of the doctors who accompanied him were met through his private funds  Prime Ministers Secretary, Bradman Weerakoon highlighted this and it is something that is unheard today.
Dudley Senanayake was a devout Buddhist, but one who believed that everyone should have the right to practise the religion of his choice in peace and absolute freedom. That is true tolerance as preached by Gautama Buddha, which seems absent today. At the time of his death, his personal bank account showed a balance of only a few hundred rupees. The great man who was elected by the people taught another great lesson to all politicians by resigning from the post of Prime Minister, the leadership of the UNP and politics altogether.
When he passed away, he was neither the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Opposition, He was only a Member of Parliament representing the Dedigama electorate, the electorate he represented throughout as a parliamentarian. Having lost the general elections of 1970, he declined to accept the post of the Leader of the Opposition and decided to remain only as a Member of Parliament. His untimely demise came as a shock to the nation. Hundreds of thousands of people from all walks of life started pouring into Colombo to pay their last respects to this great man. It was remarkable indeed that the people had sunk party differences to honour a great leader....Dudley Senanayake, who was arguably the foremost democratic leader this country had produced since Independence.
May he attain supreme bliss of Nibbana.



June 19, 2018, marks the 107th Birth Anniversary of Late Premier Dudley Shelton Senanayake. His name is carved with pride in the heart of Mother Lanka, as the Bath Dun Piya and was an illustrious democrat who held the office of the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, on four occasions. 
He treated everyone as his own Kith and Kin
	
	During his reign there was no religious or communal violence
	
	His food drive campaign was highly commendable
	
	His honesty, integrity and kindness remain unquestionable till this moment
	
	He was an example to all the leaders through his impeccable leadership qualities

Following the footsteps of his renowned father DS, the Father of the Nation Dudley took immense pain and interest to develop Agriculture. His food drive campaign was so successful that the Country becomes almost self sufficient in Paddy Production during his time. His honesty, integrity and kindness remain unquestionable.
He treated all the people as his own Kith and Kin. During his reign there was no religious or communal violence. Being a friendly leader he was the pioneer to offer an Open Invitation, to the general public to join the New Year feast at the Temple Trees.


Among those who responded to the invitation was a helpless couple, trying to save the life of their sick child. Having listened to desperate parents the Prime Minister gave immediate orders to the bureaucratic officers,Break any law and to take any risk to save a human life. Which deadlock was the Blood Bank, at the time did not release blood to the private hospital where the child was critically serious. Similarly in another instance Prime Ministers Secretary, was reluctant to release an efficient officer who sought retirement from the service. One day, during the absence of the Secretary, the officer managed to place his grievances before the Prime Minister. He had also mentioned that constitutionally he was entitled for his request. Then the premier endorsed, If the Constitution allows his retirement let him retire.

Being a friendly leader he was the pioneer to offer an Open Invitation, to the general public to join the New Year feast at the Temple Trees

As a teenager, this writer often accompanied his father who was an ardent UNPer, and attended the functions where the Leader was present. It is worthwhile to recall a few incidents which demonstrate Dudley Senanayakes par excellent qualities. 
Once he participated at a religious ceremony held at the Rajasinghe Library in Kandy. At the time he was politically defeated I witnessed him arriving in his grand Pontiac car. Then he climbed up the large number of steps barefooted.
Once when Dudley went to the Mahiyangana area, during the final rounds of his election campaign, then the only place available for him have his mid day meal was the Rest House, near Minipe. The so-called political Authority of Kandy District (Minipe Kotiya), at that time played a dirty trick. In order to pressurize Dudleys campaign, he booked the Rest House it in the guise of a private function on that day. 
During the days the communication system was very poor. The organizers immediately deployed a motor cyclist to convey a message to the well-known businessman James Appuhamy that the leader and his group would come there for lunch that day.


During lunch, a confidante of the leader, Late Newton Dias, had noticed the leader was so fond of eatingPapadam. Afterwards Newton had remarked Sir, I thought your favourite curry was Moringa but now I realize you like papadam too. Then the cat came out of the bag, the leader did not know that the lunch arrangement was made in advance and he had thought to save food for the large unexpected group who had come with him. Accordingly he told Newton Dias, that when you eat Papadam the stomach gets full. Dudley Senanayake, never thought of himself but was always very concerned about the welfare of the others. 
This writer was beside the leader when he made his last address to the people of Kandy on February 4, 1973. It was just two months prior to his death. Addressing the historic mass rally held at the Bogambara esplanade, he requested the people to raise their hands and pledge their support to save the Democracy of this Country.
Alas, today the Democracy in the land has been hijacked by the so-called trade unionists and even by Medical practitioners who are supposed to be rendering a Nobel profession. Democracy is for the people, by the people and to the people, as President Abraham Lincoln said.
Therefore on an occasion as today it is high time for the Government to accelerate law and order. Especially, the President may take stern action to control saboteur mockeries in order to safeguard Democratic rights of the masses. Our constitution sanctions such emergency actions as welfare measures for the Democratic Society. 
May Mother Lanka, be blessed with sons of the calibre of the late Dudley Senanayake.

Global refugee count reaches new record of 68.5 million
	

The global number of refugees and internally displaced people climbed to 68.5 million last year, setting a new high for the fifth year in a row, the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) said on Tuesday.
The political crisis and fighting in Congo, the war in South Sudan and the mass exodus of the Rohingya minority from Myanmar were major drivers for displacement, according to UNHCRs annual Global Trends Report.
During 2017, 16.2 million people - or one person every two seconds - were uprooted.
The notion that is so prevailing in many countries is that the refugee crisis is a crisis of the rich world. It is not, said Filippo Grandi, the UN high commissioner for refugees.
An estimated 85 per cent of the 68.5 million refugees around the world have sought refuge in poor or middle-income countries, he told a press conference in Geneva ahead of the launch of the report. The biggest host country in 2017 was Turkey, with 3.5 million mostly Syrian refugees. Pakistan, Uganda, Lebanon, Iran and Germany followed in the list of major hosts.
The data showed that nearly 70 per cent of the worlds refugees have fled from just five countries: Syria, Afghanistan, South Sudan, Myanmar and Somalia.
The flow of refugees could be slowed down greatly if some of the wars and crises in these countries were solved, Grandi said.
But we havent seen any significant progress in peace-making or peace-building in any of these countries, he added.

## Title: Gotas knotty bid

Gotas knotty bid
	
Sri Lanka needs a leader who can create stability prosperity; Unfortunately, Gotabaya is not that one

Perhaps the most decisive intervention of Americas Ambassador in Colombo, Atul Keshap during his three-year span seems to be a parting shot at a farewell meeting with ex-President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
During the tete-a-tete, Mr Keshap had cautioned the ex-President against fielding his younger brother as the next Presidential candidate.

Gotabaya has three main hurdles; citizenship, 19A and global repercussions
	
	The process would be further complicated if any of the aggrieved parties filed a case against Gota in US American court.
	
	Compelled to rely on China for everything and anything

According to the story which first appeared in the Jaffna based newspaper Kaalaikkathir, and reproduced by senior journalist D.B.S Jeyaraj, the US Ambassador has said that the Western nations, including the USA, would not favourably regard Gotabaya Rajapaksas presidential bid.
Nadesapillai Vithyatharan, who edits the Kaalaikkathir, and formerly the editor of Sudor Oli has a love-hate relationship with the Rajapaksas.
He reportedly visited Vanni as an emissary of Mr Rajapaksa soon after the latters assuming of Presidency in 2006 in order to cultivate a link between the Government and the LTTE.
Later, during the height of the war, he was abducted in a white van and later emerged in TID custody.
Mr Rajapaksa first denied that the content of the conversation had been divulged by his camp. Since then he has claimed that the US Ambassador had said no such thing. The US Embassy has been non-committal, citing the privacy of private meetings.
None of that clears uncertainty that looms over Gotabaya Rajapaksas Presidential ambitions. There are three fundamental concerns.
First Gotabaya Rajapaksa is a dual citizen of Sri Lanka and the United States of America. In theory, anyone who becomes a naturalized US citizen is required to renounce any prior allegiance to other countries during the naturalization ceremony, though that does not necessarily amount to the renunciation of the other citizenship.
While the American Citizenship Law provides a clear-cut way for the renunciation of American citizenship, in practice, it may not be as straight-forward as it appears. The Foreign Minister of the UK Boris Jonson, himself a dual citizen, but wanted to get rid of his American citizenship to avoid dual taxation, had complained it was very hard.
It should be harder for Mr Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who faces serious allegations of human rights violations.

Indians, who do not want another Rajapaksa.. would destabilize the North. Modi administration is striving to reclaim Indias losing influence in South Asia; Gotas ego-fuelled antics would trigger an immediate and forceful reaction.

The process would be further complicated if any of the aggrieved parties filed a case against Gota in an American court.
Mr Rajapakas acolytes of Viyath Maga, and other fancy forums and lobby groups have the liberty to cry blue murder, but, when he took oath as an American citizen, Mr Rajapaksa has effectively obliged to follow all its obligations. Now, his Presidential ambitions are placed at the mercy of Washington, which, obviously does not want to see him contesting the Presidential Election.

Americans and Europeans, who have recently subdued their calls for war-crime investigationsRather than letting these demands die a natural death, Sri Lankans would help revive them by electing Gotabaya Rajapaksa.

Second, the 19th amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka precludes any dual citizen from holding the elected office. There is already a judicial precedence in the Supreme Court ruling that revoked the post of Member of Parliament of Geetha Kumarasinghe on the grounds of her dual citizenship.
Given the geopolitical connotations of his presidential bid, how soon Mr Rajapaksa can relinquish his American citizenship is not so much a matter of expertise of his lawyers.
His failure to make himself eligible, and the Rajapaksas desire to hold on to the dim hope till the eleventh hour, could well expose the SLPP to a rude shock. On the other hand, the Rajapaksa camp has no viable option other than Gota.
The third concern and the far more consequential of all is the international repercussions of Gotabaya Rajapaksas Presidency if it ever materializes by some luck or due to the complacency of the UNP.
It is easy to dismiss international concerns as a blatant interference and claim the public will would prevail. However, things are not as simplistic as that.
In 2006, the Palestinians, fed up with corruption and nepotism of Fatah, the political arm of the PLO, voted militant group Hamas to power in the Palestinian Legislative Council. By doing so, they effectively dug their own grave and that of the nascent peace process.
Palestine is withering the repercussions of that parochial choice with no end in sight.
Mr Gotabhaya Rajapaksa is an equally destructive choice. Not only would his presidency roll-back whatever democratic reforms achieved so far, it would also trigger international repercussions with far-reaching implications, which a small State like Sri Lanka cannot afford.
Indians, who do not want another Rajapaksa in power in Colombo, would destabilize the North.
With the proactive Modi administration that is striving to reclaim Indias losing influence in South Asia, Mr Rajapaksas ego-fuelled antics would trigger an immediate and forceful reaction.
Americans and Europeans, who have recently subdued their calls for war-crime investigations, would find no reason for such niceties.
Rather than letting these demands die a natural death, Sri Lankans would help revive them by electing Gotabaya Rajapaksa.
The Japanese who have recently shown a special interest in economic cooperation would also slide away- or would be persuaded to do so by their American allies.
Mr Rajapaksa would be compelled to rely on China for everything and anything, and he himself should know from previous experience, such overdependence entails a higher cost than it would otherwise do.
Sri Lanka needs a leader who can create stability and guide the country towards prosperity. Unfortunately, Mr Gotabaya Rajapaksa is not that one.

Govt. should IMPLEMENT THE AGENDA on which it was elected to office in 2015 - German Envoy
	
German Ambassador Jorn Rohde, in an interview with Daily Mirror, speaks about the current status of the political situation in Sri Lanka, bilateral relations and the way forward. Excerpts:

There is the pending task of constitutional reforms
	
	Germany supportsSri Lanka for economic modernization, democratic reforms and reconciliation
	
	It seems the Government itself is also doing the work of the opposition
	
	When united we win, if divided we fall

How do you see the current status of German- Sri Lanka relations
We marked the 65th year of our relationship. Our relationship has been excellent most of the time. There were some irritants under the previous regime with German political foundations having to leave the country.
From a trade perspective, things look very good at the moment, with a bilateral trade volume of US $ 1.5 billion last year. Four years ago, it was only half of that amount. We also see a growth in tourism.
This year, we are expecting 150,000 German tourists in Sri Lanka. On March 27, Germany opened a professional trade office. This will further boost trade between the two countries. We just had a German delegation on the topic of wind energy in Sri Lanka. At the moment, a Sri Lankan delegation is in Germany. At the end of the year, the Asia Pacific Trade Conference will take place for which all German companies in the region will come together. We also look forward to a Sri Lankan trade delegation led by the Minister.
Germany supports Sri Lanka in its quest for economic modernization, democratic reforms and reconciliation.
Sri Lanka has the vision to become a hub in South Asia. I think the regaining of GSP Plus creates fertile ground and is a good starting point for further expansion.
We support Sri Lankas path of economic modernization. I welcome the Free Trade Agreement with Singapore. Sri Lanka is on a path to further open up its economy.
Singapore is extremely successful because it has opened up its economy in the last 50 years. It has a very efficient legal environment and an excellent infrastructure. If Sri Lanka continues in its path toward economic modernization, that can be achieved here as well, but, you have to do the reforms.

Germany is one among the countries that welcomed the change of Government in 2015. How do you look at it in retrospect
We support Sri Lankas policy of reconciliation and democratic reforms. It is not my task as a foreign envoy to comment on specific points. Like Germany, Sri Lanka has an established democracy. In any democracy, the Government has to govern.
The Opposition has to oppose. When I read your paper sometimes, it seems that the Government itself is also doing the work of the Opposition. Generally speaking, it is not a recipe for success if you are not united as the United will win, the Divided will fall, as the saying goes. The German Government and the EU continue to urge the Sri Lankan Government to implement the agenda it was voted for in 2015. It means reconciliation and democratic reforms.
Democracy also needs credibility. You have laws. The laws are there to be enforced. It is as simple as that. Those involved in past and present corruption and criminal activities should be brought to book. Misdeeds need to be punished. It is important that the legal system provides timely justice. In this regard, those behind the recent communal unrest in Kandy should be brought to book.

How do you look at the progress made by the Government during the past three years in the implementation of this agenda in terms of reconciliation
We see progress. You have democratic reforms. You have the Right to Information Act and the Office of Missing Persons. The enforced disappearances bill was introduced. The Reparations Bill is being prepared.
Those are all steps in a positive direction. The general democratic climate has improved a lot. But, there are still things to be done. There is the pending task of a constitutional reform. That seems to have stalled a bit. The minorities who voted for the Government expected some sort of devolution. Looking at the results of the last Local Government Elections, there surely is a disappointment because of the lack of action in this regard by the Government.

For example, When Sri Lanka and Germany deal with each other, interests of both sides should be taken into account. Then, it is a win-win situation. Otherwise, you create antagonism.

German political organizations played a role in activities related to power devolution in the past. They were sent out by the former Government. What is their role now
German political foundations had been in the country for decades. But some unfortunate things happened under the previous regime. They are back now.
If they are asked, they continue to support and give advice. Germany is not the only country. There are a lot of countries that help civil society organizations and the Government in sharing best practices for democratic reforms.
I am not here to propose the German example. Every country has to find its own path. My advice for the Government is to implement the agenda on which it was elected. We are ready to support. We do support that process through various means i.e. through our development cooperation with GIZ. Also, a Sri Lankan Parliamentary delegation went to Germany in 2017 to study our Parliamentary systems both at state and Federal levels. These are all examples to show how it can be done. How you will finally do it is entirely Sri Lankas choice.

How do you see Sri Lankas political environment forGerman investors
We see the potential of the country, otherwise, we would not have opened a trade office here.
However, it is still not the great leap forward. You know Sri Lankas standing in all these ratings- the ease of doing business, corruption index. There is room for improvement. If these parameters improve, investment will flow on a much bigger scale. The current Government is working on it. Large import duties also prevent Foreign Direct Investment. Look at Singapore! They are a success because of an open economy and they encourage a competitive environment.

Sri Lanka has drawn the attention of the countries such as India, Japan, China and the United States because of its strategic location. How does Germany view it
Last year the Prime Minister gave a speech proposing a code of conduct for the Indian Ocean region. That is to make it a zone of peace and to ensure freedom of navigation. Germany fully supports a rule-based world order.
We support Sri Lankas efforts in that respect. Last year, the German Foreign Office conducted an ambassadors conference in Colombo on the topic Indian Ocean. On these issues, our thinking is fully in line.

Do you see the Indian Ocean as not peaceful enoughat the moment
There is the danger that the situation could deteriorate to one like you have in the South China Sea. The Sri Lankan Government sees that potential danger. They want to act preventively and ensure together with all littoral states that the Indian Ocean region remains conflict free within a rules-based environment.

Today, almost all the developing and developed countries turn to China for investment in infrastructure development. Such development needs of these cannot be addressed by the western powers. How do you see it
As for Chinas One Belt One Road initiative, we generally support the initiative to upgrade infrastructure that contributes to sustainable growth in the region.
It is very important that all partners interests need to be respected. For that to happen you need transparent rules and open tender procedures. The international banks such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank should be included. If these standards are not met, you will have a situation like the one Sri Lanka was in under the previous regime.
You will have white elephant projects like Mattala Airport, from where the last commercial airline recently left the airport. That is a huge burden to the State coffers. It prevents the Government from investing money in new projects because it has to pay back loans. It is just that unnecessary projects should not be funded by international agencies. The World Bank is not a Western institution. So is ADB. Today, Japan and the European Development Bank are financing a lot of development projects in Sri Lanka. They would not finance projects that are not viable.

How do you look at the Hambantota Port project
I am not an expert. The only thing I would say is that there were huge loan obligations. I think the Government was faced with a difficult choice. Faced with an enormous debt burden through loan repayments the Government in this case through a debt-equity swap- turned the loan into investment.
As I said, you can avoid these mistakes if you scrutinize large infrastructure projects for their economic, social, environmental and fiscal sustainability. In short, you have to meet standards. Otherwise, there is a danger of vanity projects being implemented. These projects then generally cost the taxpayer dearly.

How do you look to future political relations between Sri Lanka and Germany
Our relations are excellent at the moment. We support Sri Lankas reform process. We have a lot of similar outlooks on international issues. We are urging the Government to continue with the reform process and implement its agenda. Trade will continue to grow dynamically if reforms are carried out in Sri Lanka. We are grateful to Sri Lanka for supporting Germany to be elected as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council.

The United States has different worldviews under the Trump administration. How do you see the dynamics of the Western world inthat context
Let me quote from a speech the German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas gave last week in Berlin:
Our answer to America First can only be Europe United. The EU is trying to be a voice of sustainability. Politics is the art of compromise. For example, When Sri Lanka and Germany deal with each other, interests of both sides should be taken into account. Then, it is a win-win situation. Otherwise, you create antagonism.

How do you push for common goals in the West when the US is not supportive enough
We are and remain strong allies bound by common democratic values. There currently are a few irritants. If there are - as we in the EU see it- unlawful custom duties imposed by one side, there is a measured reaction announced by the EU. There is also an answer from Canada, Mexico and others. Germany and the EU continue to push and uphold an open and multilateral trade system.

Habitat for Humanity Sri Lanka builds a brighter future with families in Homes not Houses project

For the 25 years that she is married, Ushathevi never had a permanent house. My husband and I came from poor families but ours was a love marriage. They used to live wherever they could find work as daily wage laborers. After being displaced by Sri Lankas civil war in 2006, they lived for over a decade in a temporary shelter given by a nongovernmental organization.
In 2017, Ushathevi, 43 and her husband, 47, marked their silver wedding anniversary by moving into a permanent home. Their house in Vilavettuvan village, Batticaloa province, eastern Sri Lanka, was completed on August 22, 2017. They moved in the next day that was considered an auspicious date.
Ushathevi and Thillainathan were the first to build their home with compressed stabilized earth blocks, an alternative construction material that is promoted under the Homes not Houses project. Funded by the European Union, the project is implemented by Habitat for Humanity Sri Lanka and World Vision Sri Lanka. As of 31 May, 2018, 353 homes have been constructed and more than 1,836 homes are currently in different phases of construction in the eastern district of Batticaloa and the northern districts of Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu. The multi-year project includes the construction of conventional brick-and-mortar houses as well as homes that are built with alternative construction materials such as compressed stabilized earth blocks.

Thillainathan had applied to become a Habitat homeowner after he learned of the European Union-funded project. I heard that Habitat is providing special blocks. My wife and I visited the yard and checked the blocks. After we saw that compressed stabilized earth blocks were stronger than fired bricks or cement sand blocks, we decided to build a house with CSEBs.
At the block yard in Batticaloa, they saw demonstrations on the blocks strength and durability that were conducted by Habitat Sri Lanka and its partner organization World Vision Sri Lanka. Despite being immersed in water, the edges of the blocks remained intact and did not dissolve, said Thillainathan. He also observed that the blocks did not break when thrown on the ground. Later, he did the same strength test with the blocks that were brought to construction site for his house.
During the house construction, Thillainathan helped to mix mortar, sieve sand and move materials such as blocks, timber and tiles. Both he and his wife also cleaned up the build site.
Since moving in, Thillainathan estimated that they have received up to 1,000 visitors, many of whom are interested in building a home like theirs. I told them that this is the best house for us. There is no need to expect more, he said, adding that all the visitors have only good things to say about his house. Pointing out that the temperature is cool inside his home, Thillainathansaid: If they (the visitors) build a house like mine, they will also get the same benefits.
People from the local community checking out the newly completed house of Thillainathan and Ushathevi.
Meanwhile, Ushathevi could still recall the days of living in a door-less temporary shelter. Whenever there was heavy rain, I would put pieces of cloth all around to absorb the water that came in; I couldnt sleep because I had to keep wringing the water out of the cloths. Whenever the children had to do their homework, the family could not go to sleep because space was limited in the temporary shelter. Now that they have their own room, the children are also going to bed earlier, Thillainathan noted.
Their family used to relieve themselves in the bushes though they were afraid of being seen as well as being bitten by insects. With their own toilet next to the house, they have more privacy and safety. They get water that is piped in from their own well.
While the family has started a home-garden growing vegetables such as okra, eggplant and chilli, Ushathevi is planning for the future. In three to four years time, she wishes to paint the interior of the walls. I will choose one color for the blocks and another color for the grooves. I will consult the painter about this.
Thillainathan gave the reason for holding off the painting of the walls. Until the Habitat-EU project is completed, people are still visiting our house. If we paint the walls, they cant see the blocks. Now people are saying that the blocks look nice without being painted.

He puts his foot down
	

The Pohottuwa stalwarts are now embroiled in a big row over the question of their relationship with the Gang of 16, they say

Meanwhile, the failure on the part of some JO stalwarts to back the party nominee, Katana lady who ran for the Deputy Speakers post has added a new dimension to the internal dissention.
This issue had triggered a heated discussion at a high-level meeting of the party held last Tuesday at which the former strongman had launched a tirade against the party seniors who had failed to pull their weight in favor of the party nominee.
The former strongman who had issued a severe warning to those defying his instructions had emphasized that the backing of the Group of 16 was vital for winning the upcoming polls and his politics was winning people and not alienating them.
He had silenced even a family member with an angry retort when the latter tried to hold a brief for those under fire, they say.

Number One had a meeting with the leaders of the constituent parties of the alliance recently. Their discussion concentrated mainly on strengthening the alliance to face the upcoming polls from a position of greater strength.

After the talks, Number One inquired from the party leaders whether they had any problems which they wished to discuss.
At this stage, a certain party leader often referred to as Prince Maname speaking in an angry tone, told Number One that the geological survey and mines bureau head had cancelled his permit for mining sand from Mahaweli river bed at Manampitiya.
After giving an attentive ear to the tale of woe of Prince Maname, Number One had asked the alliance secretary to intervene to help the politico. However, Number One who knows well the track record of Prince Maname had confided in others that that the it was quite possible that they had cancelled the permit for valid reasons.
By the way, the alliance secretary had spoken to the bureau head about the cancellation of the permit, but he had refused to restore the permit or reissue one.
Now deprived of the massive income from sand mining, an angry Prince Maname is reportedly going round cursing the government and the government high-ups, they say.

Influenza: Nebulizer liquid not upto standard- GMOA
	
The nebulizer solution imported from Pakistan to be used for the prevailing influenza was contaminated and could pose more dangers to users, the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) charged yesterday.
It also called for the resignation of Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne.
It was proved in a Microbiology Investigation that one of the packs of the nebulizer solution was contaminated, GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Naveen de Zoysa said a news briefing.
The GMOA charged that the nebulizer solution imported from Pakistan to be used for the prevailing influenza was not upto standard.
This situation would create further complexities, when somebody uses the nebulizer with germs. This would put victims of this influenza into further danger, Dr de Zoysa said.
One thing is clear that Minister Rajitha has been unable to tackle with the outbreak properly. The Government is still unable to declare properly whether the prevailing outbreak in South is influenza or not, Dr. de Zoysa added.
He said the Government should be more responsible and should take prompt steps to mitigate the epidemic without letting it spread to other districts. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Last days of yahapalanaya
	

The young politico from Rajarata, who was recently shifted from the Blue partys general secretarial status to organizing status has become highly disconcerted over being the main target of attack by the Gang of 16.

He also feels that the Gang is responsible for his demotion in the party as well, they say.
The young politico highly upset by the frequent scathing attacks made on him by the flamboyant politico from Uva had complained to Number One that he had got disgusted with politics, and that he did not mind giving up his present post in the party.
Number One has now decided to hold a meeting with the Gang of 16 in a bid to iron out the ever-increasing differences with their yahapalanaya colleagues, mainly to pull them off from breathing down the neck of the Rajarata politico.
However, the Gang of 16 leaders as well as the Green party stalwarts openly declare that the days of yahapalanaya are numbered and its fall is only a matter of time.
Meanwhile, reports say that another group from the Blue party is expected to join the Gang of 16 shortly. Some of them held a secret night discussion with the former strongman at his official residence the other day, they say.

The Power and Energy Ministry had finalized the proposal to award this contract to a foreign company, bypassing a lower tariff bidder in Sri Lanka.
This proposal which was criticised on the basis that it would cause a loss of Rs.50 billion to the State was taken up for discussion yesterday.

Mafia Groups Rule The Roost at CEB
	
When the Ceylon Electricity Board was established in 1970 the total power output was 265 Megawatts. This comprised of 192 Megawatts from Hydro power and 73 Megawatts from thermal power. During this time there were only 70,644 consumers. The cost of generating one unit of electricity was cents 9 and distributed among the consumers atcents 15 a unit. 
In this manner the Ceylon Electricity Board continued to serve the public during a period of twenty five years making profits while functioning smoothly. However things changed in 1996 when a lengthy power shortage emerged. Even the clocks were turned back by one hour in attempts to find a solution. The public witnessed an extension of working hours by one hour during this period. 

Present position
At present the daily requirement of electricity is in the region of 36-37 Gigawatt hours. Our sources of power are Hydro power, Diesel power, Coal power, Wind power and solar power. These are fully and partly owned by the CEB and the private sector. There are mini hydro power stations and large scale Solar and wind power plants owned by the private sector. 
When the CEB is generating power from 18 large reservoirs, it is amazing to note that the private sector is providing power out of 181 mini hydro projects. From these mini hydro power projects alone 360 Megawatts are added to the national grid. The situation with regard to the thermal power is that Norochcholai generates 35-40 percent of power. Kelanitissa, Sapugaskanda and Chunnakam are other thermal plants belonging to the CEB. 
S . Matara, Asia Power, West Cone, A S Embilipitiya, Agrico Hambantota, Galle, Pallekele belonging to the private sector too contribute significantly to the power requirement of the country. 

Wind Power Plants and Solar Panel Plants
By May 23rd 349 Mega Watt hours had been added to the national grid while 153 Mega Watt hours of power had been added to the national grid from the Solar Panels daily. There also exist islandwide wind power plants as well as domestic solar panels belonging to the state and private sector. Presently 50 Mega Watts of power are generated from wind power plants. Ten Mega Watts each from Vavuniya, and Welikanda and 50 Mega Watts from Hambantota are added to the national grid. There are plans in the near future to launch 06 projects to establish wind power plants in 20 identified stations that have the potential to generate 1 to 60 Mega Watts of power. In addition it is expected to generate 90 Mega Watts of power from 17 locations. Tenders had been called to implement them. 
Houses located in difficult areas, which dont have access to power generated from the national grid, and isolated villages located on mountain peaks are provided with power from Solar Panels. Some have made these panels by themselves and others have fixed large solar panels in their houses. The CEB purchases one unit from these sources at Rs 22 during the first seven years. The value of the panel is repaid within the first seven years.
Thereafter a unit is purchased at a price between Rs 8-15. The national grid is composed in the following manner 

The cost of a unit of electricity
The formula followed by the CEB when purchasing one unit of power.This data proves that producing electricity is at its lowest when Hydro Power is used. Experts in the subject say that from the Inginiyagala Hydro Power Plant, power could be purchased at around six cents a unit. The national grid obtains about 53- 54 percent of its power requirements from hydro power. Economically this is followed by coal power.
This country also occupies a formidable position among countries that use diesel. It is also worthy to note that exactly half of the requirements of the national grid is obtained by extinguishing fossils ofDiesel and Coal. 
A CEB spokesperson said that sometimes 10%of the requirements are obtained from diesel and 40% from coal. There are variables during the times when water is available. The use of hydro power increases during the dry season when power is obtained from diesel power plants. Given that the price of diesel has risen it is not far away when the customer will be burdened with the weight of this cost. 

How electricity is obtained by the National grid
Giga Watt Hours Mega Watts. The issues begin from here. At present hydro power generation is at optimum levels. The Mahaweli River tops the list as the river which generates the most electricity. River Kelani has become the river that has the most number of power plants. Environmentalists claim that the country cannot bear to have so many power plants on its rivers. While blaming the diesel plants and Coal power plants they continue to use the power generated from these sources. 

According to them there exists a mafia in which CEB electrical engineers are involved

The Conspiracy within the CEB
The engineers of the CEB charge that the Government isnt removing corrupt officials and businessmen of the Public Utilities Commission and is not allowing it to run as an independent institution. They also state that there are conspiracies within the CEB in casting aside a power generation plan drawn up by experts in the field and instead are working in support of a scheme thatll nourish the owners of private power plants. 
The civil activists who represent the rights of the electricity consumers are of the opinion that a certain group is working hand in glove with some owners of diesel power plants and are hellbent on the removal of the chairman of the Public Utilities Commission and working towards sweeping under the carpet the much anticipated long drawn power generation plan. 
There are other civil organizations representing the CEB which claim that the majority in the CEB are depending on money and they value the institute more than a gold mine. 

Mafia groups
The workers of the Oil Corporation too share the CEBs view. According to them there exists a mafia in which CEB electrical engineers are involved. The countrys total production and development rests on their shoulders. Therefore it is their view that the Electrical Engineers also have the ability to control those in high posts in the Government. 
However judging by the allegations levelled at each other it proves that a mafia exists. We live in an era where electricity is an essential need of every individual and its demand is increasing two fold every ten years. Therefore it isnt surprising that different types of mafia and conspiracies relating to electricity that exist are deep-rooted. 
These mafias as Diesel mafia, Coal mafia and mini plants mafia. These mafias cause power interruptions and also lead to the change of Ministers and officials. These mafias are even operating internationally. Its a known fact that changes that have occurred in the highest positions of many countries are the results of interventions by these mafia gangs. The recent reshuffle of cabinet Ministers in our country proves that this situation is present here too. There had been changes of heads in the Fuel and Electricity sectors. 

Getting rid ofPUC head
An allegation is levelled by those who love the CEB that there is a plan to remove the Director General of the Public Utilities Commission PUC). This is a serious allegation. He has introduced a long-term plan regarding electricity generation. The plan will greatly favour the country.
The Electrical Engineers, who claimed that the project was harmful to the country, introduced an alternate electricity generation plan. It is doubtful which plan would be chosen for implementation as the decision of the mafia would finally reign.

King Solomons Mines
Many groups connected to the CEB are directly or indirectly involved in these mafias. Those who oppose them can go home on their own accord or choose, as an alternative, to be interdicted for fraud. This is why it is said that the CEB is a treasure trove full of gold, minerals and silver, much more than King Solomons Mines. 

The extent of the Diesel Mafia
Amounts paid during the past five years for the purchase of diesel power from private power plants.

Rs 31 Billion spenton diesel
This expenditure is not small. This amount had been recovered from consumers and thereafter paid by the CEB. The amount that had been spent exceeds the amount of Rs 10 billion in the alleged Bond scam. It is pertinent to investigate how a sum equivalent to 30 times the value of the alleged Bond Scam had been spent to purchase diesel power during the past five years.  Despite power plants established from 2013 up to now, on the recommendation of electricity generation plans and with the view of providing electricity at low cost, questions are raised as to how this colossal amount was spend. Who was behind the purchasing of diesel power at a huge cost and making payments to the private sector 

Mini electricitypower plants
The truth is that over the years high ranking politicos-who held power- or their siblings, relatives and friends had become share holders or owners of private Hydro Power Plants. Added to this during emergencies power had been obtained from Mini Electric power plants which are fully or indirectly owned by CEB engineers. There are 181 such power plants now in operation. In 2010 this number was 94. During a period of seven years the number of such plants has increased by one hundred percent. When considering the cost of obtaining power from these Mini power plants, the CEB could have built its own Mini power plants or built a new LNG power station. The CEB despite showing reluctance to put up Mini power plants prefers to purchase power from the private sector. 
If the need arises to obtain power from a Mini power plant or from a Diesel power plant, one should only close Circuit A or B of the power generation circuit at Victoria Power Station. This could be simply done by giving one telephone call. This way they could create a country-wide emergency situation and go ahead in purchasing power from the private sector. 
During the immediate past these type of incidents took place. This type of situation could also be brought about by a sudden strike action, or adopting a work to rule campaign. Considering it as a matter of national importance taking preventive action is the order of the day. 
The other important issue is why this country, which could spend Rs 310 million during a period of five years to purchase diesel power at a high cost, construct its own Macro level power plants to use wind power and solar power A unit of power from Wind or Solar panels costs less than Rs 10. But it appears that the CEB prefers to make the large scale entrepreneurs richer. The businessmen, possessing solar panels fixed on their houses, add the power generated during the day to the National Grid and use the power from the national grid in the night. A rough estimate suggests that if they had given 100 units to the National Grid during a month and if their electricity bill shows the use of 90 units, they will receive a zero bill. 
This is also another fraud. There is a clear difference between the price of a unit of a solar power and the price of a unit of electricity. But this fact has been ignored. 
These arent acts of normal pilferage, but done in a right royal manner. The authorities abhor the actions of unions which point out these lapses or stage protests disapproving them. It is noteworthy that presently the leaders of trade unions, affiliated to the three main parties, had been discontinued from service. They may be called up soon to be re-appointed. If they do not fall prey to any bribes or are not elevated to higher positions and betray their followers, there is every chance of more large scale acts of fraud and corruption regarding the CEB being revealed. 

Even though much is spoken about renewable energy the situation remains unchanged

Response from Tennekoon
The following is a response from Ranjith Keerthi Tennekoon of the Anti Corruption Front. There are only a handful of honest officials in the CEB. Mafia is present in most institutes and not confined to Diesel and Coal industries. The providing of electricity in the country and to our homes is carried out in the way the Mafia thinks best. But it is strange that the country is not aware of these Mafias. Purchasing of Diesel power from private sector goes unabated sighting urgency requirements.  Even though much is spoken about renewable energy the situation remains unchanged. Though pronouncements are made that Diesel Power is purchased in accordance with international price structures, most of these transactions involve underhand grafting. Tenders were called for the construction of 17 liquefied natural gas power plants, but construction had not begun in a single one. Muddling during the time the tenders were opened frustrated foreign companies. These companies were willing to invest. They left saying that they will never invest here. One company had filed a case at the appellate Courts. 
Stories of Ministry officials owning houses in Australia and UK surfaced. Many skyscrapers emerged in Colombo. The main task now is the making of financial plans for the 2020 Elections. Even though the President has the power to take any decision regarding any ministry no decisions have been taken with regard to the Mafia that is prevalent at the CEB. Still Norochcholai hasnt obtained the environmental certificate even though one year has lapsed since 30th June 2017. 
The environmental security order imposed on Norochcholai hadnt been activated so far. According to environmental reports there had been discharges of Mercury, Nickel and Zinc. During the past few months the workers had contacted several sicknesses. 
Thuggery was used when tenders were called for at Kerawalapitiya. In Hambantota permission had been granted for LNG power plants without calling for tenders. The CMEC which constructed Norochcholai had been the most fortunate investor. The entire world is aware of how this company paid commissions to politicians and officials. LI CHOYANG, who was the vice chairman of that company and in charge of operations in Sri Lanka, was convicted of grafting and corruption and was jailed in 2014. At that time a Chinese Bank declined to grant loans to this company. However permission had been granted to such a company to operate. Investors who were brought down by the BOI returned. 

In response to a letter published in Lankadeepa on June 10 under the headline How top ranks earn money by supplying electricity to the country the Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers Trade Union in a letter signed by its secretary C.H.D. Gamage states the following.
A charge has been raised against us in a letter that we are engaged in an effort to oust the Public Utility Commission Director General because he has presented an electricity generation plan favourable to the country.
The duty of the PUC is only to monitor the activities of the CEB. However getting involved in duties or controlling the CEB do not come under the purview of the PUC. Also they do not have the authority to engage in CEBs duties. They are also not qualified to prepare a plan to generate electricity. It is also criticised for being a stooge of businessmen and non governmental organisations and abusing the power of an independent commission.

On one occasion that PUB issued an order to buy electricity even at a price higher than Rs. 23 per unit from private wind power stations. However the CEB showed it was possible to buy electricity at a price between Rs 12 to15

The main charge against the PUC Director General is putting the CEBs functions in a state of confusion.
It isnt known to many in the society, but there are cases pending against him in court on charges of giving bribes to some members of the PUC to sell solar energy systems.
Our concern is only to have honest and experienced officers to serve the PUB and work for the benefit of the public.
Another complaint is the stoppage of a major power plant in order to lavishly earn through the selling of electricity generated by minor plants. These plants are owned by CEB engineers. But it is a known fact that electricity generated by hydro, wind and solar are linked to the main grid through the panels installed on roofs of the individual buildings.
Accordingly, the owner of the minor generation location can link its supply to the main grid without involving the CEB. This clears the CEB of the charges that it manipulates power generation of the Major power stations and in its bid to sell electricity generated through the minor generation plants.
The other complaint which is emptying the major reservoirs to enhance the buying of electricity from the diesel power plant is also a fabricated story spread in the society, the CEBETU later states.
On one occasion that PUB issued an order to buy electricity even at a price higher than Rs. 23 per unit from private wind power stations. However the CEB showed it was possible to buy electricity at a price between Rs 12 to15 enabling the supply of electricity at a lower price. But PUC did not agree to the alternative buying suggested by the CEB and finally we had to seek the decision of the court to save the people from being burdened by this chaos.
On another occasion CEB ETU members had to face death threats when they opposed the proposal included in the Budget to make a payment in dollars for the supply of electricity through minor generation plants.
These situations help to identify clearly who are profiting under the guise of environment protection, in the sale of minor hydro, wind or solar power generations. Yet another frequent complaint levelled against our trade union is about a mafia operation dealing with the supply of diesel and coal. The threats being made on us are accelerating after we began to challenge the racket involving large scale LNG power stations which are operating beyond the need of the country.
This is done by several strongmen of the Government under the cover of foreign investment.

With regard to large scale investments and the long time involved in gaining returns, private investors dont fancy making investments. On the other hand a coal power station is often planned on soft loan obtained from countries like Japan

Coal is imported to the country by a separate company, which is state owned, and diesel is imported by Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. CEB is not involved in the import of both these supplies. And those against us are intentionally engaged in a process to link CEB in a corruption net with regard to the import of coal and diesel.
We dont have any special liking to coal or any other fuel and our power generation plan includes sources of power such as Hydro electricity, LNG, coal wind and solar. If we are only interested in our comfort, we prefer a more convenient operation which involves LNG and Diesel power stations located close to Colombo. This is better than struggling to operate a coal power station in a difficult area like Puttalam. 
With regard to large scale investments and the long time involved in gaining returns, private investors dont fancy making investments. On the other hand a coal power station is often planned on soft loan obtained from countries like Japan. The fear of losing profiteering opportunities compel the opposition forces to fight against the coal power generation under the guise of environment protection. 
Our wish is to help usher in a good future for the younger generation by providing electricity at an affordable price and develop industries. Finally we would like to stress that the main aim of making complaints against CEB engineers is to clear the bad impression created against us. Our efforts have thrown obstacle in the way of those who are trying to rob peoples money through the CEB, he said.


When contacted a spokesperson of the Public Utilities Commission PUC), who wished to remain anonymous, said that when going by the terms of the Public Utilities Commission Act there is a minimum cost at which electricity could be purchased. 
Under clause number 43 powers are vested to amend the power generation system. What should happen is to obtain power from a plant proposed by the generation plan at the minimum cost for a specified period. There should be a mixture of power stations. What are the types of power stations that should be constructed, at what price should power be purchased and what should be its capacity are all mentioned therein. The main requirement should be the availability of power at the lowest price for the consumer, also taking into consideration the impact on the environment. 

Under clause number 43 powers are vested to amend the power generation system.

The power generation plan should be amended every two years. But the plans of 2013, 2015, and 2017 havent been made active. They should make amendments taking into consideration the economic changes and changes in technology. These are based on forecasts: 
For example until 2011 we never thought about Solar Panels that could be mounted on roofs. But now we are obtaining power from them. An amendment was brought in 2015/2017 to make us obtain 90 Megawatts from this source. 
Its normal that with the phase of economic development the demand for electricity is expected to rise. Accordingly the required capacity had been worked out. For example if a power station with capacity to produce 200 Megawatts is constructed it would greatly facilitate in meeting the increased demand, the spokesperson said.


Minister of Power and Renewable Energy Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said that the CEB purchases electricity only to meet emergency requirements.
During earlier times we purchased electricity to meet the requirements caused by the severe drought we experienced. When the water levels in the reservoirs generating power dropped to 20% we purchased electricity which was done keeping with international specification by calling for bids. There is no way that electricity can be purchased haphazardly. We only purchase thermal power in order to offset the difference in the daily generation of electricity by the CEB.

When the water levels in the reservoirs generating power dropped to 20% we purchased electricity keeping with international specifications.

We are doing this in order to balance the output in the circuit. The other point is that we resort to this practice of purchasing electricity following a tender procedures despite whatever urgency the requirement is based on. Electricity is an essential requirement of the public without which we cannot exist. Sri Lanka is the only country in Asia where electricity is provided all twenty four hours of the day. Anyone can level charges against this activity. We are acting in a complete transparent manner. If anyone makes any allegation I am ready to conduct a justifiable investigation.


The General Secretary of the CEB Workers Union Ranjan Jayalal said that the gravity of the frauds and corruption in the CEB is such that the three leaders of the workers unions belonging to all three main parties have been interdicted since February 11. That is what happened to those who spoke against the arbitrary salary increases.
Fraud and corruption are well-rooted everywhere in the CEB. Only very few have been spared. I too was offered Rs 2 million to resist me from speaking about frauds and corruption.

Fraud and corruption are well-rooted everywhere in the CEB. Only very few have been spared. I too was offered Rs 2 million

This is a big game and those who do not wish to take part in these games have only two options; either go home with corruption charges or with an interdiction order or keep supporting it, he said.


Sri Lanka Independent Workers Union Secretary Priyantha Prabhath said that no investigations had been conducted regarding the allegations made in connection with the Mafia in the CEB and also about the revelations made by many.
There had been no investigations regarding the matters disclosed by Minister Champika Ranawaka. The mafia is so active here. A recent example may be quoted.
An electric post fell recently and four CEB employees were injured. Earlier some permanent workers died. Up to now no investigations had been conducted. There are several issues regarding the quality standard of these electrical posts. These issues are dragging on without any solution in sight.

A recent example may be quoted. An electric post fell recently and four CEB employees were injured. Earlier some permanent workers died. Up to now no investigations had been conducted.

The emoluments of senior officers of the CEB administration are 120 times more than their salaries. This is despite the circulars stipulating that it should not exceed 60%. No one makes any inquiries about it, said Prabhath.

Now he should keep his word
	

Several Green members were engaged in an animated discussion in the assembly lobby the other day.

The topic was the latest rumour that some backbenchers were to be raised to deputy and state level.
Most of them were inclined to believe the rumour. They appeared exited and hopeful. However, one young member from the South pooh-poohed the very suggestion. Are you all mad, Machang he derided their expectations. Take my wordThis will never happen!
A gabby Banda from Wayamba spoke up: This is not a mere rumour. I know for sure that some of us are going to become deputies and state level ones soon!
The young member from the South again dismissed as rubbish the prospect they all seemed excited about. I am not as gullible as you are! he said.
The Wayamba man was not prepared to let his assurance be disdained. There is no use in arguing about it! he said: Are you prepared to take a bet on it
The member from the South readily accepted the challenge and said:
Okay. If what you say doesnt come true, you should move on your bum from the entrance gate up to the council here. If it comes true, I will crawl the distance the same way! On my bum!
And the duo shook hands on it!
A few days later, the Wayamba man saw his colleague from the South at a distance and hailed him: Machang, what about the bet Pat came the reply: That stands! Get ready for the bum walk!
What the member from the South never expected happened a week later. Both members involved in the bet found themselves raised to deputy level.
Now they all are looking forward to the spectacle of the member from South paying the penance of pushing himself forward on his posterior from the entrance gate to the council for losing his bet!

NPC considering traffic monitoring using Google data
	
The National Police Commission (NPC) said it was hoping to control the increasing levels of traffic in major cities with the help of Google Data.
At its weekly meeting last week attended by Police Chief Pujith Jayasundara, Moratuwa University's transport expert Professor Amal Kumarage presented a memorandum on how Google data could be used to resolve the mounting traffic issues.
His detailed presentation included how best to improve Transport Traffic Management in Sri Lanka, based on specially designed software and explained the magnitude of the traffic problems faced by major cities in Sri Lanka including Colombo and Kandy.
Prof. Kumarage's presentation was made on the initiative of the Committee on Motor Traffic and Tourist Police, appointed by the NPC to look into policy issues related to Traffic and the Tourist police.
The NPC said it was one of the seven committees appointed by its Chairman P.H. Manathunga in 2017 to identify and address priority areas which needed immediate intervention by the Police.
The huge increase in the use of private vehicles and a deterioration of public transportation such as train and bus services, has led to the increase in private vehicles causing severe congestion in towns, with an increasing number of road accidents. Private vehicles not only causes traffic and vehicle accidents but also aggravate environmental problems, loss of useful man-hours and fuel. As a result, major cities would become unlivable in the near future, the NPC said in a statement.
Prof. Kumarage underscored the fact that Transport Traffic Management in Sri Lanka could be effectively handled and coordinated with the Ministry of Transport, Provincial Transport Ministries, Traffic Police, Urban Development Authority and the Department of Motor Traffic. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

PARADISE LOST, NOT REGAINED!!!
	

Many articles written in different genre sadly convey the same underlying fear that governance is a choice between existence and extinction and our Prime Ministers ambition, if ever he had one for the country, is as good as dead! Ranils leadership has been challenged on more than one occasion, but it has not yielded the desired result. Someone once said, You are strong when you know your weaknesses; you are estimable when you appreciate your flaws and you are wise when you learn from your mistakes! How long has this country been waiting for this government to learn from their mistakes Will they ever learn

It is time and the time is NOW, when the UNP should give due recognition to its young ministers who are both progressive and innovative and rearing to show their mettle! One of our young ministers had given an interview recently in which he acknowledged that there was much to be done and, more importantly, to start building bridges and winning hearts. He is so right, but the people are naturally asking, WHAT HAVE THEY DONE ALL THIS TIME DID THEY NOT REALIZE THAT THIS WAS THE ONE THING THEY SHOULD HAVE ADDRESSED AS SOON AS THEY CAME INTO POWER Why should the backbenchers have to be patient Isnt it their precious vote that brought this government into power, so why should they have to wait It is unbelievable that it takes so many years for a government to formulate strategies and tactics!!! What about policy then WHAT OF GOVERNANCE So many WHATs so many WHENs so many IFs so many WHYs So many aberrations, so many unsolved mysteries, so many promises not kept; indeed so many miles to go before they sleep!!! The changes within the government itself have been many, pointing to no confidence within their own ranks!!! What absolute and utter chaos!!!

If the old guard steps down and some of them are OLD indeed, at least the country will have a chance at redemption. Most of the young ones hail from illustrious fathers, who, if given the opportunity will turn the country around. Do what must be done without prevarication, know their goals and go straight for the jugular. They will have fresh perspectives and want to change things around for the good of the country, hopefully! Like our older politicians have given new meaning to barren, they should now step aside and let the young ones give new definition to duty!

Moving away from what should be done and has not been, let us take a look at what COULD be done to make this country more meaningful again. Perhaps, if just one of the younger conscientious ministers takes it upon himself to put a group of people together and start something new, something which is absolutely necessary to show the people of Sri Lanka that there are THOSE WHO CARE!!! A group, together with one or two of our lady ministers, visit our hospitals on a regular basis, especially the childrens hospitals, the cancer hospital, where there is so much devastation, to take a look at what really needs to be done, to show there are those who really care. It would indeed be a first but a necessary first so the people know that their ministers are capable of caring in every sense of the word! 

Not forgetting the Karapitiya Hospital, where tremendous mercy missions are being carried out by the few doctors who care and are pleading for better facilities and more buildings to house patients, especially children. If these visits are undertaken on a regular basis, they would be able to do so much, to ensure that vital needs like medicines are made available and more wards built to ease the current congestion. The people will then know, recognize that there are ministers who care and that is the all important issue!!!

If the old guard steps down and some of them are OLD indeed, at least the country will have a chance at redemption. Most of the young ones hail from illustrious fathers, who, if given the opportunity will turn the country around. Do what must be done without prevarication, know their goals and go straight for the jugular


Beside hospitals, the prisons need attention too! True, the prisoners are jailed for offences committed but that does not mean they are not human beings. They need people to talk to them, to show them where they have gone wrong, to begin the all important process of rehabilitation. They could be introduced to worthwhile hobbies, for both men and women and assisted to do things that could bring them in a little money, if a sale is organized to display what they do! Someone in power needs to kick start something like this and I am not talking of the Aloysius and other notorious criminals but the ordinary men and women, some of whom even with children, who desperately need someone to talk to them, to listen. Someone to show them, to tell them where they erred, where they went wrong and set them on the road to rehabilitation. People will remember such kindnesses for their entire lives, we are all human. They were stupid enough to get caught, but if one shows care, those people will never forget that for the rest of their natural days. Imagine the impact it will have on a subsequent election!!! It will be tremendous!!!


The other areas that need attention are the disabled war heroes, Army, Navy, Air Force and Police. They ALL PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE FOR US, so should we not give back to those who gave They sometimes get attention to them, perhaps once a year with fanfare and trumpets; medals pinned on them, but is that the important issue here How about something more permanent Look at what the royals are doing in their country. The young princes have established Trusts and Charities to look after the disabled war heroes, the cancer patients and so forth, continuing the work their young mother, the late Princess Diana started and getting programmes established, so that the work will not be interrupted! That is what we need to do here too, have programmes established so that the work does not fall apart! If royal princes can get down to taking part in such humanitarian work, why cant we 

We are all under this misconception that to be happy you have to be rich and famous. So many rich and famous people are committing suicide these days, most of all celebrities! They are not any happier than the rest of us! So lets ask what would make us happy. Researchers say the same thing, meaningful relationships, community awareness, doing good for others, religious awareness, helping those who need to be, experiencing gratitude and forgiveness! All these cannot be bought or sold! They are all free! No one can sell them to you, that is why they are in such short supply!!!

We are all under this misconception that to be happy you have to be rich and famous. So many rich and famous people are committing suicide these days, most of all celebrities! They are not any happier than the rest of us! So lets ask what would make us happy

Price reduction on more essential drugs: Rajitha
	
The Health Ministry will reduce the prices of another batch of essential drugs in July to provide further relief to patients, Cabinet spokesman and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said today.
He said the Health Ministry had drastically reduced prices of 48 essential drugs used for diseases such as diabetes, heart and kidney ailments, fever and many other common diseases.
The 48 drugs are in high demand and by reducing the prices we have been able to reduce the monthly drug bill of patients by half. The National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) is in the process of selecting the essential drugs for the price reduction, the minister said.
He said the price reduction on the new set of drugs was in addition to VAT exemption on channel services effective from July 1 and that a complete price formula would be introduced to private hospitals, nursing homes and clinics covering the entire private sector health service.
The minister said the ceiling of Rs.1.5 million worth of drugs imported annually for cancer patient had been lifted and with the issuance free of charge of stents for heart diseases and lenses for eye surgeries had brought down the health bill.
"The task of introducing a drug formula and to reduce drug prices is not easy, because the drug mafia that earns over 800% profit from medicinal drug business is extremely powerful. They maintain a monopoly on drugs with the help of certain officials and politicians and I have no doubt that they would do everything possible at their disposal to sabotage our efforts. But we are determined to put the maximum profit possible at 80% or less in the medicinal drug business through the drug formula, he said. (Sandun A. Jayasekera)

## Title: Sri Lankas weapons of mass deception  Rajapaksa machinery

Sri Lankas weapons of mass deception  Rajapaksa machinery
	
Ones days were too brief to take the burden of anothers errors on ones shoulders. Each man lived his own life and paid his own price for living it.~Oscar Wilde

Mahinda Rajapaksa and his clan have fine-tuned that aspect of political dynamic that could be solely responsible for delivering an ailing political entity into super-action mode and achieve the results that such an action desired. This fine-tuning of the Rajapaksa-propaganda machinery did not take place yesterday when they were in the opposition. They have achieved or they thought they have years ago, that lofty goal of mass deception and political hoodwinking so that they could be in power forever. Yet, they failed. Vexing of the masses to such an intolerable extent has its own inherent disadvantages. What appears on the shallow surface does not necessarily happen to be deep enough to make the gullible masses suffer to an unending degree.

Figures cannot be distorted and stats dont lie
	
	Carnage of peoples rights is not an option for a civilized nation
	
	Financial cleanliness should be a manifest characteristic of an acceptable leader
	
	Sajith and Navin should remember the sense of duty and responsibility of power

Nevertheless, the current euphoria they have artificially created about a sibling of Mahinda Rajapaksa and the accompanying message that he would be the next Presidential candidate will not hold any water come the day of reckoning. Their lies and exaggerations have to be met with facts, figures and statistics. Facts are not figments of imagination of some wishful-thinking activists; figures cannot be distorted and stats dont lie. A phoney image created around a demonic political character cannot and should not last, at least for the sake of our nations staunch commitment to democracy and freewill. That phoney bubble will burst; itll shrink and disappear but it would not happen automatically. It must be made to happen by human hand. And that human hand can be provided only by the United National Party (UNP).
Almost all the alleged atrocities committed by the Rajapaksa regime could be attributed to this particular member of the Rajapaksa family. Some of the alleged atrocities amount to murders in broad daylight; some to abduction and torture of journalists; some to spraying bullets on protesters whose sole demand was cleaner water; some amount to violation of fundamental human rights; all possible human right violations have been alleged against this individual and now they, the so-called Viyathmaga (path of intellectuals) are paying Pooja to this individual hallucinating about a return to chaotic rule of the Rajapaksas when all of the above outrages were deliberately committed in order for them to remain in power and ransack the countrys coffers and treasures. The carnage of the peoples rights is not an option for a civilized nation.
The hallucination on the part of the now-defeated Pohottuwa politicos will continue their selfish and utterly-destructive politricks unless and until a sufficiently motivated group of counter-organizers band themselves and stop this sacrilegious wolf that comes in sheeps clothing. It is only possible; it is more of a national urgency that these leftovers of the Rajapaksa era are made politically immobile forever by all means available within the frame of democracy and human rights. Their donors must be approached; their so-called intellectuals and academics must be met at debates and present counterpoints to each and every demented point and arguments they make; their frontrunners and grassroots supporters, if any, must be converted to more humane, reasonable and sensible men and women. It is no easy task. The propaganda machine, their weapons of mass deception are much more potent and sharp than what the UNP has managed to deploy as at present.
In such a dangerous scenario, the government must be objective, detached and aloof of politics. But the UNP as a political party, with its newly-resuscitated politburo with a new and charismatic National Organizer (Navin Dissanayake), should be able to launch a robust public relations campaign. If the party leader is not ready, then disregard his un-readiness; the officials of the party have inherent duties and responsibilities to take action without creating divisions within the party framework. A scrupulously defined and vigorously activated campaign of positive image-building, party-branding and professionally-crafted messaging need to be paid attention to.
If a coalition candidate, Maithripala Sirisena, backed by the anti-Rajapaksa majority in the country coupled with an overwhelming bulk of minority voters against Mahinda Rajapaksa, the most difficult-to-defeat person of the Rajapaksa family, could emerge victorious, a clean and charismatic candidate from the United National Party stands more than a fighting chance to gain victory at the next Presidential elections in 2020. What is essential is a strategic view of the whole operation and excruciatingly diligent execution with the right people on ground to operate a campaign.

Some of the alleged atrocities amount to murders in broad daylight; some to abduction and torture of journalists; some to spraying bullets on protesters whose sole demand was cleaner water; some amount to violation of fundamental human rights

Where do you find such candidates or a candidate Navin Dissanayake, the charismatic current national organizer and Sajith Premadasa, Deputy Leader of the UNP are qualified, experienced and transparent leaders whom the electorate would accept as alternatives to the Rajapaksa clan. There is no such second-tier leader among the siblings of the Rajapaksas. Financial cleanliness should be a manifest characteristic of an acceptable leader. In a sea of corruption, nepotism and naked corruption, it is quite hard to find one without a murmur of these ignoble traits. However, subject to future findings, both Sajith and Navin stand out as clean among the potential candidates for the prize of presidency. Could they endure a gut-wrenching and vicious vitriol of the Mahinda-led opposition Can either of them withstand the born-again merchants of corruption who now appear before the public as saviours of the countrys treasury which they themselves pilfered when they were the switch-holders of the government machinery These poachers of the peoples will should be stopped now. Because this government failed to do so when they had a better than good chance at the beginning of their term in 2015, the urgency of the matter is even more exaggerated and compelling.
These questions will have to be answered in the coming few months. It is inevitable that more and more exigencies would emerge as a result of transparency and accountability facilitated by the current administration, as against the last one which advocated policies for a closed society as was evidenced in countries run by dictators and military personnel, and the unhindered interest shown by the social and formal media.
The weight and burden of leadership is very heavy. Some leaders manage to carry it with stoicism and detachment while others stumble because of the sheer heaviness of it. Greatness dwells in those who carry it without a murmur of complaint; they have chosen to carry that weight and are prepared for the consequences; those who complain and choose to lay the blame on his or her colleagues and other bedfellows will fall by the wayside. History is filled with these charlatans who had happened to be there when the time arose whole those who succeed as great leaders are the ones who pursued to carry that weight.
Human life is hard; no one will give power to you; you have to pursue it and get it. The charms of power might try to benumb you for a moment or two, yet you have to carry on regardless remembering that the power you carry on your shoulders has enormous responsibility and a strong sense of duty intrinsically residing within that. Both Sajith Premadasa and Navin Dissanayake have to show that they have not only the desire to hold power; they need to remember the sense of duty and responsibility of that power.

THE COMING  CLASH OF EXTREMISMS  &THE TWILIGHT OF PLURALIST DEMOCRACY
	
The proper functioning of a pluralist democracy presupposes the free interplay of diverse opinions. The freer and more active, the better
Mervyn de Silva, Inaugural editorial, Lanka Guardian May 1st 1978 


The very last thing this island needs is to slide into another cycle of conflict. But thats where we are headed unless we stop, think and make choices and changes of the correct kind. 
This is the first time that mainstream society and politics both in the North and the South, have seen a simultaneous rise of extremism. What we face today is the dangerous phenomena of (negative) symmetry and simultaneity. Despite a neoliberal cosmopolitan government which has been rightly criticized for appeasement of Northern bellicosity and has been crippled electorally as a result, the slogans and symbolisms from the North, the political discourse and behavior of the Northern Provincial Council and civil society movements, have escalated in their militancy. 
The combination of a spike in Northern stridency and the economics of neoliberal globalization on the part of the dominant drivers of Government policy, has generated entirely predictable results: a displacement of mainstream social opinion towards populist neo-nationalism. 
As in many other parts of the world, in Sri Lanka, it is neoliberal economics that is threatening liberal democracy by implementing policies which have generated an inevitable mainstream backlash. Cosmopolitan neoliberalism has bred nationalist neo-conservatism. 
By converting to neoliberal globalist evangelism, the traditional centre-right UNP has lost its centre, its national credentials and mass base, thereby creating a Frankensteins monster of a radical neo-nationalist New Right. There is an emerging bloc of tendencies and strata making up the backbone of a rising New Right neo-conservatism. The foot-soldiers are a vast current of the petty bourgeoisie. The ideology or rather the social psychology is one of resentment (Nietzsche famously used the French term Ressentiment while relentlessly combatting it). The animating spirit and style are of rancor and intolerance. 
Reason and Realism tell us that Sri Lanka must eschew the two rival rightwing projects, a neoliberal globalist Right (in decline) and a neo-nationalist Right (in ascendancy). The neoliberal globalist Establishment, in its cosmopolitan elitism, does not understand the countrys heartland and will not transfer leadership to the one in their political formation who can. The neo-nationalist Right, in its nativist parochialism, does not understand the texture of the terrain beyond the heartland, be it on the island or outside; be it the Tamils, India, the West or the world-system. Soon, the ideological centre will no longer be the political centre of gravity. 

There is an emerging bloc of tendencies and strata making up the backbone of a rising New Right neo-conservatism

The real political and ideological challenge is to open a Middle Path to a centrist outcome. If it is not done, if there is no political de-escalation in the North and the South, this small island will face for the first time, an election which could be the last free national election we have, because it will result in the victory of extremist, politically and ideologically fundamentalist forces in the North and the South. 

We are heading for a frontal political and ideological clash. In the North it is propelled by the university student body, Gajan Ponnambalam and Wigneswaran, and in the South by hardline ultranationalists in civil society caucuses and networks

We are heading for a frontal political and ideological clash. In the North it is propelled by the university student body, Gajan Ponnambalam and Wigneswaran, and in the South by hardline ultranationalists in civil society caucuses and networks. One can imagine just how chronically weakened our pluralist democracy would be, just how intolerant a society this would be if these two stratums wielded power, authority and influence. 
A country in which such forces face each other, wielding power at the centre in Colombo and at the periphery in the Northern Provincial Council and the parliamentary seats representing that area, will be a more sharply polarized country than at any time in our memory. It will no longer be extremist minorities, mostly plebian, on both sides; it will be extremist majorities including elites, elected to office and supported by their respective Diasporas. The polarization between the communities will not be merely island-wide but global. It will be a global zero-sum game. 
The only way in which this nightmarish scenario can be avoided is by identifying and strengthening the populists centrists, the moderates, the progressives in all political camps. There are three sources of moderation in this countrys politics: 
I. In the growing anti-government space it is Mahinda Rajapaksa who stands head and shoulders above the others, supported by the mature oppositional personalities like Dinesh Gunawardena and Vasudeva Nanayakkara. They head the largest centrist progressive or pluralist-populist ensemble in the countrys politics, namely the Joint Opposition-Pohottuwa bloc. 
II. President Sirisena and the SLFP, especially the Rebel Sixteen, are pluralist-centrists. 
III. Populists in the UNP like Sajith Premadasa, and liberal-democratic UNP semi-dissenters such as Vasantha Senanayaka, Navin Dissanayake and Ruwan Wijewardena are the UNPs moderate centre. It is pointless speaking of the UNPs globalist neoliberal elite as moderates, because it is precisely this Establishment that has by its very nature and policies, constituted the most effective growth medium for the neo-nationalist Alt-Right. If things remain as they are and go the way they are going, the electoral swing may be as in 1977. The North is far more out of control than the South, because the politics of fanaticism has been the norm. The North has to make its mind up soon: Will it actively work towards an alliance with moderates across the Southern spectrum, and will it limit its demands to that which Southern moderates can take to the ballot box and win or at least stay viable Is the North willing to accept that the only political solution any Colombo administration can be held to, and which it can sell its constituency, is to proceed with the implementation of the 13th amendment as per the 1987 Accord and the wartime understanding with India 
Will 2019 be the last democratic election we have before the State and System are tightened, and society straitjacketed preventing a free swing of the pendulum and democratic alternation in office Will it be a soft landing, or a catalytic and combustible change, triggering a chain reaction leading to a catastrophe which turns us into a former Yugoslavia 
Never have I witnessed mainstream society in the South react against moderation, liberalism and even social democracy, embracing a New Right common sense that democracy is dispensable/we need a tough leader, as I have seen in the past few years and months. The hierarchy of the Buddhist clergy and the more hawkish-ex-military brass are the secretors and purveyors of this ideology. They are trying to pull off a political putsch for the candidacy. 
The problem is not the candidate. It is the constituency and the ideology; the project. The project entails a retrogressive remodeling of the State, in which the clergy is above the law and dictates (vidhaanaya as Ven. Elle Gunawansa, the orator of Kanatte July 83 recently pronounced) to the State. It is the shift from the civilizational and cultural reality of our Sinhala Buddhist heritage to a notion of 21st century Sri Lanka as a Sinhala-Buddhist state ( or simply, a Buddhist state). 
To be sustainably successful in a complex and challenging external environment, the Oppositions candidate has to pivot away from this fringe and relocate and root himself firmly within the pluralist democratic political mainstream, avoiding a regime project that is a junta installed by electoral means. 
If the hawkish Alt-Right project wins, Sri Lanka, which was once the most advanced democracy in South Asia, may have a remodeled state in Sri Lanka along the lines of (Zias) Pakistan or Myanmar, which this time would surely seek a unilateral solution as the perennial North-South problems surface in a cycle of revolt-rebellion-repression. A regional response will be triggered. It is only a fusion of the moderates in the Opposition that can shape a different and safer outcome.

Those in jail must wear the prison jumper: Thalatha
	
Referring to Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary the Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thera sentenced to a jail term of six months rigorous imprisonment, Justice and Prison Reforms Minister Thalatha Athukorale said yesterday any person convicted by Court should wear the prison jumper as provided by the Prisons Ordinance.
She said this in her letter to Ven. Prof. Kotapitiye Rahula Thera, the Anunayake of the Supreme Sangha Council of the Kotte Chapter, regarding the convicted monk wearing the prison jumper instead of the saffron robe while serving his prison term.
The minister said according to the Annunayake Thera, a Buddhist monk could only be disrobed by the particular Sangha Council and that the Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs could only do so under the direction of the relevant Mahanayake Thera of the Nikaya.
As far as I understand, under normal circumstances, a monk can be disrobed at his own will. The sole authority to decide on such a matter lies with the specific monk or the relevant Nikaya such a monk belonged to. The government has no authority to decide on such matters, she said. All citizens should abide by the law under an independent judicial system. The Prisons Ordinance provides the means of dealing with those who are sentenced to prison followed by a Court verdict. The Prisons Department is governed by the Prisons Ordinance."
She said as provided by the Prisons Ordinance, any person serving a prison sentence followed by a Court verdict should wear the prison jumper and it was in no way connected to any religious bias. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Up to 192 people believed drowned as tourist ferry sinks in Indonesia
	
The Sinar Bangun tourist ferry had a maximum capacity of 60. But as the sun began to set on Monday evening, more than 200 people are thought to have crammed aboard the small, rickety vessel to make the 40-minute journey across Lake Toba, on the Indonesian province of North Sumatra.
Many of those on board were young families returning home to celebrate Eid al-Fitr, the Muslim holiday that marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan, which this year lasts until June 21.
Within 20 minutes most of those passengers would be dead, trapped inside the vessel's main cabin as it overturned and sank.
Moments before the accident authorities believe high waves of up to three meters had buffeted the boat, rocking it from side to side.
"When the boat started to list I jumped into the water and swam as far away as I could," said Rudi Wibowo, one of only 18 people to have been pulled from the water alive, all within a few hours of the sinking.
Wibowo had been on the island of Samosir in the middle of Lake Toba as part of a camping trip with nine friends. He saw all of them drown.
The majority of those who survived were outside on the front deck, as they had arrived late and the seating areas were full, Wibowo told CNN, who trod water for an hour before he was rescued.
"The passengers inside were unable to break the windows and escape," said Wibowo.
The Indonesian emergency services believe most of the bodies of the victims are still trapped inside the two-tier Sinar Bangun at the bottom of the lake, which is up to 505 meters (1,657 feet) deep.
"We now consider this a recovery effort rather than a search and rescue due to the amount of time that has elapsed since the sinking," said Indonesian National Board for Disaster official, Wanda Ketaren.
Surya Dharma, a first sergeant in the Indonesian Air Force (TNI-AU) was one of the first military personnel on the scene.
"Survivors told us that parents had to choose between trying to protect their children by staying on the boat and hoping it wouldn't sink, or jumping into the water and watching them drown," said Dharma, adding that many of the passengers couldn't swim and there were not enough life jackets on board.
Recovery efforts have been complicated by the lack of an official passenger manifest.
Without any way of knowing the exact numbers aboard the stricken boat, the Indonesian authorities are relying on estimates provided by family members who arrived following news of the accident.
As of Wednesday, the number of missing had increased to 192 people, according to figures provided to CNN by Indonesian National Search and Rescue Agency spokesperson Dedi Karyadi.

US assures it will help SL fulfil UN commitments
	
In the wake of the US pull-out from the UNHRC, US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Atul Keshap met with senior Sri Lankan officials today and assured them that the US would continue to support Sri Lanka as it works to fulfil commitments made with regard to UN resolutions.
In a statement thisevening, the US Embassy said Ambassador Keshap had assured Sri Lankan officials that they will remain fully engaged with Sri Lanka.
We would continue to support the Sri Lankan Government to meet its continuing and standing commitments to the international community, to advance the cause of reconciliation and lasting peace for all Sri Lankans, it said.
It said Sri Lanka and the US co-sponsored two UN Human Rights Commission Resolutions, 30/1 in 2015 and 34/1 in 2017, and the US continues to extend its fullest support to Sri Lanka to fulfil these important commitments and obligations as articulated and reaffirmed in these resolutions.
It also said Sri Lanka's continued progress towards the fulfilment of these international commitments will facilitate further growth in bilateral relations between the two nations and enhance Sri Lanka's ability to engage with friends and partners around the world.
We will follow Sri Lanka's progress closely and look ahead to engaging with Sri Lanka between now and March 2019 in the spirit of friendship that has marked our recent relations. As Sri Lanka takes further steps outlined in the Geneva resolution, the USwill also support and expand our bilateral partnership, the US Embassy said.

US quits UNHRC over anti-Israel bias
	
The US has pulled out of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) calling its anti-Israel and a cesspool of political bias, the BBC reported.
US envoy to the UN Nikki Haley has said the "hypocritical and self-serving" body "makes a mockery of human rights."
Ms Haley last year accused the council of "chronic anti-Israel bias" and said the US was reviewing its membership.
Ms Haley announced the US's intention to quit the council at a joint news conference with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who called the council "a poor defender of human rights".
UN Secretary-General Antnio Guterres, in a statement released through his spokesman, responded by saying he would have "much preferred" the US to remain in the council.
The UN human rights commissioner, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, called the US withdrawal "disappointing, if not really surprising, news". Israel, meanwhile, has praised the decision.
Formed in 2006, the Geneva-based council has been criticised for allowing countries with questionable human rights records to be members.

Why the world would love a messed up Messi than a hat trick Ronaldo - EDITORIAL
	
Unlike in politics in sports the clever often rise to the top. On the top comes the distinction. The world would never shy away from distinguishing the one who is both clever and good against the clever and the bad. It is this that sees the world adoring a Roger Federer against a Rafael Nadal and a Lionel Messi against a Cristiano Ronaldo. The bad here does not mean bad in an unwholesome sense. Its just that they are being too loud, pompous, arrogant and also perhaps not decent enough. Closer to home theres Sachin Tendulkar for the good boy example while a super talented, but incorrigibly arrogant Virat Kolhi is the anathema of many cricketing nations. 
With Lionel Messi messing up Argentinas first match, reigning champions Germany being beaten by a mediocre Mexico and hot favoruites Brazil held to a draw by Switzerland, the first few days of the ongoing FIFA World Cup saw quite a few upsets. Messi was later quoted as saying his missed penalty against debutante Iceland hurt him a lot. It should be as the same day saw his nemesis Portugal skipper flamboyant Cristiano Ronaldo scoring three goals against Spain thus earning a draw with his neighbour. 
Argentina, which is slated to play the next match against a dominant Croatia which beat Nigeria 2-0 on Sunday, however was fortunate enough to tie the match with Iceland 1-1. 
Ronaldos hat trick on Saturday certainly was feted. However one cannot help, but wonder what would have happened if it was Messi who scored the three goals instead of the 33- year-old golden boy of Real Madrid. Certainly the world would have loved it better. On the other hand if it was Ronaldo who missed the penalty instead of Messi soccer fans would have bad mouthed the Portuguese skipper saying Its all his big talk, but no work. Instead when Lionel Messi missed the penalty the soccer fans across the globe too moped with him. Besides it was obvious that Argentinas defence was palpably weak and it really made matters difficult for Messi. 
Theres no doubt that Ronaldo is a legend. This Real Madrid forwards step overs, fancy passes and tricks are so magical that they have inspired hundreds of millions of youngsters across the globe. His FIFA hat-trick on Saturday which took him closer to the title of greatest ever footballer of all time reminded one of his similar feats against Sweden in the 2014 World Cup. 
However Ronaldo is also extremely arrogant and doesnt hesitate to make statements that he is better than Messi, who is two years his junior. The Portuguese skipper is better known for his Hollywood style life, flashy cars and flamboyant private life with regular link ups that often make it to the gossip magazines. Ronaldo is also a born marketer, a brand himself with his good looks and he had marketed himself as no sportsman has ever marketed himself. 
Messi on the other hand takes his stardom in stride. His modesty and dignity have earned him respect even among the bulk of Ronaldo fans, something that Ronaldo doesnt enjoy among Messis fans. The ever loyal family man and good boy even just before FIFA, Messi was quoted as saying that he considered himself a very ordinary player in the Argentina team. This Barcelona superstar keeps a low profile and leads an unruffled private life that often its only his talent that makes it to news media. Besides just like Roger Federer, Messi is endowed with a childlike quality that has endeared him even more to the audience so much so that they dont want to see him losing a match and turn sulky. 
Icelands goal keeper Hannes Halldorsson who stopped Messis spot kick on Saturday understandably said its a dream come true for him. 
In a world where people lose their heads to power and popularity archetypes like Messi and Federer always raise hopes that one can be both the best in the game and also be respectable.
