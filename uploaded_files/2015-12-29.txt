A distraction to curtail fire from Red politico
	
The Front-liners ever on the lookout for an excuse to make a noise to prove their nuisance value have grabbed the issue over the remanding of their elusive leader as a godsend.?
Now they are going round the country shouting the slogan: ?Release comrade?.?
Unceasing protests being staged by the Front-liners in the city aggravating already existing traffic snarls had become a pain in the neck of the yahapalanaya high ups and a team of purohitas tasked with the responsibility of looking into problems of this nature the other day held a conference to find a solution to this issue. ?Why don?t we release this troublesome fellow and send him out of the country?? one of the purohitas suggested.
?There?s sense in what you suggest,? another purohita spoke up. ?But there is a plausible reason for us not to send the fellow back where he came from immediately. The Red party?s vociferous stalwart ? you know whom I mean -- now becoming increasingly hostile to us, is mortally afraid of this estranged comrade, they say. So we can put the chap on good behavior by keeping his erstwhile comrade in the country for a while??
?Ah! Is that so? Then let us bide our time,? another said. All others readily agreed.

Action soon against saboteurs: Rajitha
	
	President Maithripala Sirisena and the leaders of the political parties in the ruling alliance had decided to take firm action against those who were planning to sabotage the Government?s plans to even go beyond Yahapalanaya (Good Governance) policies, a senior Minister said yesterday.
	Cabinet Spokesman and Minister of Health Dr. Rajitha Senaratne told a news conference those who were trying to topple the government would be countered effectively in the future.
	?Various political parties and groups who are allies of the government met President Sirisena on Monday and decided that we cannot follow Yahapalanaya (Good Governance) policies in dealing with those who were trying to sabotage the Government?s plans,? the Minister said.
	Senaratne said these forces were trying to create havoc in the country as they had become politically bankrupt.
	?Acts of sabotage have been planned as the government is about to arrest some important people belonging to a famous family with regard to the killing of ruggerite Thajudeen,? he said
	The Minister therefore said killers of Thajudeen would be nabbed soon.
	However, he accepted that there was delay in arresting those who were involved in the Avant Garde case.
	He said delay was due a delay in the process at the Attorney General?s Department as well.
	Asked about the allegations made against some of the government politicians of accepting monetary rewards from Avant Garde owners, the Minister said ?Some fools somersaulted where even gods feared to tread.?
	He said all those in the government, who were accused of various unlawful acts would be dealt with soon.
	This was highlighted in response to a serious of questions asked by the journalists, including over the abduction case in which supporters of MP Hirunika Premachandra were involved.
	The Minister denied allegations that he himself had phoned the Police and asked them to drop the case against Ms. Premachandra.
	?I don?t even phone the Police station in my village and also I was out of the country, when the incident happened,? he said. (Yohan Perera)

?Amendments have left only the first two words of the Budget!?
	
A group of Diyawanna members from both the ?joint opposition? and the government back benches were having a friendly exchange in the lobby soon after the adoption of the 2016 Budget.
?How?s the final outcome, Machang?? a member from the Colombo area crowed. ?We could up the last score by two!? A quick rejoinder came from a firebrand from the ?joint opposition?. ?There?s nothing in it to brag about,? he said. ?Your Budget is a clumsy job - like the little fellow?s first attempt at letter-writing ? cut and chopped and parts erased. Has an annual Budget suffered this kind of fate ever before??
?The amendments which you call cuttings and chopping were brought to accommodate the views of the opposition. Do you say that?s wrong? This is hell of a thing! It?s wrong even if we do the right thing,? the Government member stormed.
At this stage another ?joint opposition? member hailing from the Kalutara area joined the fray. He said: ?Amendments are okay. Listening to public opinion too is okay. But machang, this Budget has been subjected to so much cutting, chopping and deleting, what remains of it is only the first line: ?Honorable Speaker??
Members from both sides in the group greeted this sally with laughter and they happily dispersed thereafter!

BASL condemns Meethotamulla attack
	
	The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) tothe head of a Local Government authority, on a group of protesters, who were protesting against the garbage dump at Kolonnawa on Sunday (27) night and demanded that the assailants be immediately apprehended and dealt with according to law, irrespective of their status
	A statement issued by the Secretary of the BASL notes that among those injured in the attack were Nuwan Bopege, Attorney-at-Law.
	?Bopege is also a member of the Executive Committee, who has courageously given leadership to the movement, which has campaigned for the rights of the people of the Kolonnawa and Meethotamulla areas to live in an environment free from the squalor and pollution caused by the uncontrolled dumping of garbage, which for years, has not been resolved by the authorities,? the statement said.
	It is also apparent that the Police had through their inaction acquiesced in the attack, by withdrawing from the area a short time before, ostensibly giving the assailants an opportunity to freely attack the demonstrators.
	?It is regrettable that this is the second time in a few days that politicians from the same area have been allegedly involved in violent criminal activity against civilians.
	?The Bar Association calls upon the authorities to immediately investigate the matter and to arrest the perpetrators forthwith and bring them to justice. The Bar Association also calls upon both the President and the Prime Minister and other political leaders to take immediate steps to curb such unwarranted conduct on the part of politicians and to take deterrent action to prevent a recurrence of such incidents in the future.
	?The Bar Association urges that the right of peaceful protest must be respected. and any limitation to such activity should be done only within the framework of the law and that too only by the authorities entitled to do so. Any attempt to use mob violence and thuggery on peaceful protesters is a serious affront to the Rule of Law and will be contrary to the principles of good governance,? the statement said.

CEB records Rs.7bn cash flow
	
The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has recorded a positive cash flow of Rs.7 billion during the first seven months of this year and remains out of red with much of its debts being paid because of the favourable oil prices in the global market, the Public Utilities Commission (PUCSL) said yesterday.
PUCSL Chairman Saliya Mathew said the CEB was now in a position to consider a downward tariff revision in March if the current global prices remain unchanged or drop further.
?We normally evaluate the CEB accounts and market data in March for tariff revisions. Therefore, when the next revision comes up in March we will be able to see the possibility of providing more relief to electricity consumers by way of a tariff reduction. The revision is based on the CEB data on the previous six months. The market trends and other trade factors for the next six months are also taken into account during the revision,? he said.
Mr. Mathew said the phasing out of costly thermal power and the drop in global oil prices had contributed to the CEB?s satisfactory performance.
The CEB purchases power from three Private Power Providers as against 10 suppliers in 2014.
?In 2012, the CEB purchased 41.57% of the total power requirement from private suppliers. The CEB?s hydro power generation was only 23.10% of the total requirement but by 2015, CEB?s hydro power generation increased to 67% or 626 GWh and thermal power purchases have been restricted to a mere .2% which is a huge achievement,? Mr. Mathew said.
He said Private Power Providers ACE ? Matara, Lakdhanavi, ACE- Horana, Heladanavi, ACE-Amibilipitiya, Northern Power, and Colombo Power Barge have been shut down with only Asia Power, AES ?Kelanitissa and West Coast supply power to the CEB and thus contributing to a reduction in the CEB?s power purchasing bill.

I would not allow anyone who embrace and regard the foreign cultures with esteem to degrade the greatness of the nation and proud culture of the country,? he said.
	He said the objective of his assuming of Presidency on January 8 was to usher a developed country, while preserving the country?s culture of thousands of years and values of the civilization.
	?My views about the musical show conducted by a foreign singer is being battered in the internet by some people with the intention of bringing disrepute to me .But they should understand that their efforts would only disgrace the greatness of the country and its culture,? he said.

Families of Indian fishermen detained by SL on hunger strike
	
Angered over the inaction of the Puducherry Government to rescue the 10 fishermen detained by the Sri Lankan Navy, families of detained Indian fishermen went on hunger strike on Monday, The Hindu reported.
Sixty-five year old Alamelu from Karaikalmedu on Monday threatened to commit suicide by dousing herself with kerosene in front of the Head Post Office in Puducherry, if the government fails to rescue the 10 fishermen detained by the Sri Lankan Navy.
Eight fishermen from Karaikal and two from Nagapattinam were apprehended by the Sri Lankan Navy on poaching charges on December 8. Veeramani, owner of a mechanised boat named ?Veerarajan?, along with nine others were alleged to have been fishing in the Sri Lankan waters east of Point Pedro coast. The boat was moved to the Karainagar jetty.
Alamelu said: ?We want Katchatheevu back. Why is the government not taking any action? Why are they not giving us Katchatheevu? To whom does the sea belong? Fishing is our livelihood. If the government does not want us to venture into the sea then let them provide us jobs.?

Family gets quit notice from the yahapalanaya they supported
	
The family of the onetime vociferous politico, who was slain in an election-related street shoot-out several years ago, had been living in a government-allotted apartment at the Summit Flats in Colombo 7.
Following the death of this politico, the previous government not only allowed the family to continue living in this apartment, but also provided them with armed security. However, the slain politico?s daughter, ?who consistently complained that the mill of justice with regard to her father?s death was not grinding fast enough, crossed over to the Green party on the eve of the last general poll and later won a seat in Diyawanna.
Nevertheless, by a strange quirk of fate, the family of the slain politico received a letter from the authorities the other day giving them notice to quit the apartment they are living in as they were no longer entitled to it. There was also a follow-up visit soon afterwards by a government political authority holding high office in yahapalanaya for an on-the-spot-inspection as well.
Following the inspection, the family has got the final notice to hand back the apartment to the authorities immediately and also to pay the rental for the year 2015.
The family members of the slain politico have now begun saying how considerate the high ups of the previous regime were, they say.

A powerful purohita in the yahapalanaya gave the Diyawanna backbenchers a pep talk recently.
The talk revolved mainly around the emoluments paid to Diyawanna members. ?A counterpart of ours in the Maldives receives a monthly pay of Rs.700,000. In India it is Rs.400,000. How much are we getting a month? Only Rs.56,000. What we get after the dedcuction for meals is a mere pittance. Can we manage with this pay?? The Purohita continued after giving the members a few seconds to mull over the question: ?I decided to present a proposal to the government to give our members a better deal ? a certain concession in addition to an increase in the pay. A big loan in lieu of the vehicle permit for repayment in small instalments from the increased pay. Another vehicle if need be from the government!?
The backbenchers were highly elated over the bright prospects for them raised by the powerful purohita. And they pledged to support the Budget in one voice.
Later, the purohita informally presented his bright idea at the meeting of the highest decision making body. And the instant reaction to it from those at the highest echelons was volcanic. The highest authority in Yahapalanaya angrily turned on the purohita: ?We are now trying our best to quieten the hue and cry caused by the Budget proposals. Meanwhile, you are trying to create new issues for us. Do you want to create a situation where we wouldn?t be able to step out of our homes. Now you had better confine your bright idea to yourself.?

	?As an organization, we demand the government to release the details of the report to Parliament and to the people,? he said.

	Mr. Warnasinghe was the Health Minister of the Provincial Council and subjects including Indigenous Medicine, Social Welfare, Probation and Child Care, Women's Affairs and Provincial Council Affairs were also under his Ministry.
	Chief Minister Isura Devapriya earlier said that he would take over the Ministry of Health after the budget submitted by Mr. Warnasinghe was defeated by 45 votes to 23 on December 22.
	?The thirty eight percent of the funds had been used from the total budgetary allocation for the PC Health Ministry this year. Due to lack of fund management of the ministry, PC Minister Warnasinghe who did not have prior experience, he was unable to continue as a Minister in the council? the Chief Minister said.
	?Mr. Warnasinghe threw a challenge at me to take his ministry. But I did it merely for not accepting his challenge, but according to the powers that are vested upon the Chief Minister under the clause of 154-E5, I have the right to take over any ministry. He had the opportunity to defend the ministry till December 31. Without any discussions he projected the issue in the media. Due to this, he had brought the entire PC Health ministry?s activities to a standstill. From the public?s point of view, the Chief Minister would be responsible for this chaotic situation. Therefore, I had no option but to take over the responsibilities of the ministry and ensure its smooth functioning from January 1 next year,? he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

	The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today opposed to the Presidential move to extend the tenure of some Local Government (LG) bodies by six months and urged the government to hold the elections for these bodies forthwith under the existing electoral system.
	JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva said the elections for Local Government bodies were delayed by the government because of the issues between the main two parties in it and also intraparty issues of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).
	?It is evident that even the government doesn?t have one opinion on how to hold local government election. Prime Minister in Parliament said it would be held before New Year in April but today, the President has announced the extension of tenure of some 21 LG bodies,? he told a news conference.
	He said the pro-Mahinda Rajapaksa faction of the SLFP and the pro-Maithripala Sirisena faction also had difference of opinion on how to hold the election.
	?They simply want to find the best electoral system to defeat the other faction,? he said.
	Mr. Silva said interparty or intraparty issues should not affect the electoral system of the country or withhold the people?s right to practise democracy to elect their representatives.
	He said unlike Parliament, LG bodies were the closest to the people and therefore, it was against democratic values to keep postponing the election.
	?The government keeps coming up with various reasons as to why it couldn?t hold elections right away. If there is not enough time to prepare a new electoral system, hold it according to the existing system. With the new Constitution scheduled to be introduced next year, the government can implement a new electoral system applicable for each and every election in the country,? he said.
	Mr. Silva said they were not deterministic about one particular electoral system and that a new system should be made with all the good qualities of each electoral system.
	?This should take time. If the election is held under a new system, political parties should be given adequate time to adjust to it,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

No ban on foreign artistes
	
	The president and the government have no intention of banning foreign artistes from performing in Sri Lanka, though some have tried to give a wrong interpretation to President Maithripala Sirisena?s statement regarding the Enrique Iglesias concert, the government said today.
	Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B. Dissanayake said at a media briefing today that the president?s criticism was not directed at the singer, but rather at the organisers for the shortcomings at that particular concert, at which ?indecent? behaviour by some local fans was reported.

Office aide tames the belligerent bigwig
	
As the battle over the key chairs of the gentlemen?s game grows in unprecedented intensity, certain interested parties have begun resorting to fisticuffs to vent their animosity, reports say.?
It is well known that quite recently a contender for the biggest chair had a nasty brush with a white collar high up of the controlling body at the Sports Ministry itself. However, it is little known that the incident was an extension from a previous one.
Earlier on the day of that spat, a former bigwig of the game set upon another and then a third party also joined the fray leading to an ugly scene in front of a key chair in the Ministry. When everyone was passively looking on, a young office aide (referred to as KKS) wielding a broom stick had walked up to the scene and confronted the former bigwig of the game, the most belligerent of the three and barked: ?I say, stop fighting. If you don?t, I am going to give you a thundering slap? True, I am doing a minor job here. But I also studied in the school you did study. (He mentions the name of the school) Stop this fighting? Get out or be ready to face the worst.?
The former bigwig of the gentlemen?s game who realized that the KKS menacingly brandishing the broom stick meant business, beat a hasty retreat. And the other two also quietly faded from the scene, they say.

She benefits from both legal and extra-legal relationships!
	
This raging affair of the ex-wife of a senior politico from the South with a young one of the same tribe from the same part of the country is the main topic among the gossipy ones in political circles these days.
The politico from the South who has married again is said to be paying Rs.35,000 a month as maintenance to his divorced wife and her little daughter by him.?
Meanwhile, this fair one having close ties with the cinema, is also getting a monthly allowance from her paramour-politico, who too is a married man with one child, they say. ?By the way, this lucky one well-heeled with monetary gains from both her legal and extra-legal relationships had also already extracted Rs.10 million out of the Rs.50 million her ex-husband had been given as inducement to switch his party allegiance.?

He is a local politico raised to purohita status of a provincial council quite recently. But he has already incurred the wrath of the council members by issuing an instruction which they had found both strange and puzzling: that they should send to him whatever requests and proposals they have got only through a certain fair member.?
He has asked even the ruling party members not to approach him direct regarding any official matter. All members from both sides of the council have now decided to teach this purohita an unforgettable lesson, they say.

This is an interesting episode that has not gone on record so far: Vote taking at the third reading of the 2016 Budget was underway.?
Names were being called out and members were verbally registering their ?for it? or ?against it?. Suddenly a dainty fair one from the South quietly rose from her seat and walked towards the exit door. Several Betel leaf colleagues immediately surround her and inquire why she is leaving. ?I am going out, but coming back later ? I have to skip my turn?? she says.
?Why are you doing this?? a colleague asks.
?You all know my problem. They promised to make it ?elastic?. If I voted against the Budget, they might change their mind. Aney! Sorry Honde!? she walks out before they could call out her name.

Star willow wielder, a runner for city chair?
	
The big chair of the city is about to fall vacant and the battle for it has already begun.
Among the main characters tipped to enter the fray are the incumbent Muzza, the chair of another council and a former fair Diyawanna member.
The name of a member of a very high family is also being mentioned in certain circles, they say.
However, the latest name being bandied about is of a gentlemen?s game super-star, who went on retirement recently.
The super star no longer in the firmament has now thrown himself into community welfare activity and it?s a cinch that he could be the next occupant of the big chair if he decides to make a try for it, they say.

A political party leader has come under heavy pressure from an unsuccessful party candidate at the last general poll to take necessary steps towards removing a young Diyawanna member who is now at the centre of a raging controversy.
The party candidate who failed in his bid to enter Diyawanna has, of course, a personal reason for seeing the removal of the young politico from the council; he is the next on the list of preference votes having trailed closely behind the young politico in the race.

?Tooth- extracting? film stars!
	
Dathak galawanawa (extracting a tooth) is a phrase that has entered the popular Sinhala idiom of late. This phrase means getting some undue benefit from someone by guile?or deceit.?
Some powerful politicos are clever at taking their voters for a ride. But these heavyweights often fall for the wiles of comely girls. Incidentally, fortunes acquired by six leading film stars through the wiles used on some powerful politicos is the talk of the town these days.
Two mansions, two luxury ?vehicles and a beauty parlour are among the assets that one of the six stars has acquired thanks to the patronage of a leading politico in the Western Province.
Another ?film star who has ?extracted a tooth? from a popular politico hailing from the Hambantota district is the proud owner of a posh residence, a restaurant and a money spinning prawn farm, they say.
The fortune that yet another film star has made due to the generosity of a former high political authority includes a media-related business venture, a mansion and a prime land in Dambulla.?
An estate, a house and an expensive car account for the largesse that one of the lucky six has received from a ?former chairman?.?
There is another film star who received Rs.10 million from his political benefactor who, incidentally, is no more at Diyawanna.?
Lucky ones. Aren?t they?
