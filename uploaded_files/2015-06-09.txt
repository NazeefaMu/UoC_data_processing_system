Better if Ranil described me as a rotten ?labu gediya?: Vasu
	
Firebrand parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara, who commented on the exchange of words between him and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has said it would have been better if the Prime Minister described him a rotten 'labu gediya? instead of a rotten pumpkin.
Mr. Nanayakkara had made this comment during an interview with the Deshaya newspaper.Question: What do you think of the Prime Minister describing you as a rotten pumpkin s?Answer: I can?t understand what he meant. I could understand if he called me a rotten 'labu gediya'. But then I wondered whether the UNP was looking for pumpkins for its ?mala batha? (post-funeral meal) because pumpkins are usually in demand for this meal.

Urging the district administration to reinstall the statue of LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran in a temple near Nagapattinam from where it was removed under mysterious circumstances on Saturday, cadre belonging to Hindu Makkal Katchi submitted a petition to the Collector in Nagapattinam on Monday.
Alleging that the police have forcibly removed the statue, cadre of Periyar Dravida Kazhagam too staged a protest near Sirkazhi old bus stand on Monday, the New Indian Express said.
As the protesters did not obtain prior permission for the protest, Sirkazhi police detained 15 Periyar Dravida Kazhagam members. Similar protests condemning the removal of LTTE?s erstwhile chief?s statue was held by the advocates in front of the Mayiladuthurai judicial magistrate court.
According to the petitioner J. Swaminathan, regional organiser of Hindu Makkal Katchi, Velankannai police personnel have forcibly removed the statue of the slain LTTE chief from the Sevugaraya Ayyanar temple in South Poigainallur village early on Saturday.
He also alleged that the police have threatened the locals and sought a written statement from the villagers saying that the controversial statue was razed down by the villagers themselves.
Stating that the installation of the statue of Prabhakaran was out of admiration of the villagers and that the statue installation in rural temples as guardian spirits is a tradition of people pursuing Hinduism to worship iconic people of good deeds, the petitioners sought the removed statue to be re-installed at the same temple in South Poigainallur village.
Swaminathan added that the removal of Prabhakaran?s statue has hurt the sentiments of Hindus.
Meanwhile, condemning the police for removing the statue from the Sevugaraya Ayyanar temple in south Poigainallur village, cadre of Periyar Dravida Kazhagam held a stir at the Sirkazhi old bus stand on Monday.
As the protesters flayed the police for removing the statue, Sirkazhi police detained 15 youth for staging the protest without obtaining permission from the police.
Similarly, Mayiladuthurai advocates condemning the removal of Prabhakaran?s statue from the temple near Nagapattinam observed a demonstration in front of the Mayiladuthurai judicial magistrate court.

Digambaram opposes 20A; Mano wants more MPs
	
	Estate Infrastructure Minister Palani Digambaram said today he would vote against the 20th Amendment when it is taken up in parliament.
	He told Daily Mirror that he had taken this stance because the new proposal would not increase the number of MPs in the House. He said it would be impossible to have a multi- member seat in the Nuwara Eliya District if the number of MPs are not increased up to 255 as proposed in the original draft.
	The minister said according to the new proposal there would only be three multi-member constituencies .
	He said he could not accept the assurance given by the government that it would ensure that five representatives of the estate Tamil community would be elected to Parliament.
	"This cannot be accepted because the minority parties may not get the opportunity of nominating members in such a scenario as these decisions will be made by the major parties," the minister said and added that he would continue to be with the government as it was a personal opinion on a single matter.
	Meanwhile Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) leader Mano Ganesan yesterday said his alliance is against the decision of the cabinet to confine Parliament to 225 members.
	"We are for 20th amendment but against the decision to work out a formula without increasing the number of MPs an to elect 125 members under the first past the post system.,"Mr. Ganesan said.
	He said minorities would not be adequately repasented in the proper manner.
	Mr Ganesan charged that the decision has been not to increase the number of MPs to 255 in order to accommodate more minority members.
	Mr Ganesan said he had informed this stance to Prime minister Ranil Wickremasinghe and will meet him and President Maithripala Sirisena shortly to discuss on the matter
	Also the alliance and the other minority parties are to meet on Thursday for a meeting to discuss the situation. (Yohan Perera)

SL refugee seeks compensation for daughter?s death
	
An inmate of a refugee camp for Sri Lankan Tamils at Tiruvadavur has approached the Madras High Court Bench seeking a direction to the State to pay his family a compensation of Rs.10 lakh for the death of his 11-year-old daughter when the asbestos sheets laid on the roof of their dilapidated house in the camp caved in on May 12 last year.
When the matter came up for admission before Justice R. Mahadevan on Monday, he directed a government counsel to take notice on behalf of the Health and Family Welfare Secretary, Commissioner of Refugee Rehabilitation and the Collector. The writ petition had been filed by S. Athipathi who claimed to be residing in the refugee camp for more than 12 years. The petitioner, father of four children including the girl who died, said that the State Government had established the refugee camp in Tiruvadavur in 2002 by building about 400 houses measuring around 100 square feet each. The camp was filled up by shifting the inmates of another camp at Avaniapuram near here and his family was part of the migration.
The occupants of Tiruvadavur camp faced several problems such as poor quality construction of their houses and absence of safe drinking water. Though several representations were made to the officials concerned to improve the infrastructural facilities, their pleas went unheeded, the petitioner said and claimed that the State was liable to pay adequate compensation for his daughter?s death.

Time to discuss gay rights: HR activist
	
With the dynamic changes in societies all over world, it was time for Sri Lanka too to hold a discussion on gay rights with the input of community leaders, Attorney-at-Law and Human Rights Activist Dr. Prathiba Mahanamahewa said yesterday.
He said bombarding Sri Lanka with marriage benefits for same-sex couples at this level would not be wise but a discussion on basic rights of gay people could be considered appropriate when making decisions in the long run. ?
?Our penal code describes the act of homosexual is an unnatural offence. This penal code is a carbon copy of Indian Penal Code and that is a copy of the United Kingdom. Even the UK and liberal countries had amended the code today but not us,? Dr. Mahanamahewa said.
He said though the act was considered as an offence, it is observed that it is happening throughout the country discreetly.
?All citizens should be entitled to Right of Choice, the freedom to choose. That is why we need to have a discussion on the issue. We can invite religious leaders to take part in the discussions. If the gay community was continued to be oppressed and discriminated against, they might develop stressful and violent behaviour,? he said.
Dr. Mahanamahewa said the Penal Code, religious background and the ethical attitudes had prevented Sri Lanka from being open up for LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender) rights. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Video: UNP will win 125 seats - Akila
	
The formation of a Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) government after the next general election is only dream, United National Party (UNP) Media Spokesman and Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said today.
He told a media conference at Sirikotha that the UNP has revived itself and garnered the support of the majority Sinhala Buddhist community and as such, the SLFP would have little or no chance of winning the election.
The minister said though several attempts had been made in the past to split the UNP, its members unlike those of the SLFP had made several sacrifices to save the party.
?They kept saying ?yes sir? to whatever was ordered by Mr. Rajapaksa. Nowadays, they are making futile efforts to get their leader to return to politics so that the investigations into cases of alleged fraud and corruption and the abuse of public resources can be ended,? the minister said.
He said the UNP would definitely win 125 parliamentary seats and provide a proper response to those who attempted to sabotage the UNP and those who stoned Sirikotha. (Piyumi Fonseka and Darshana Sanjeewa)WATCH

UPFA want more MPs in FPP
	
The United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) today urged President Maithripala Sirisena to increase the number of MPs elected on the First-Past-the-Post system in the proposed 20th Amendment on electoral reforms.
This request was made at the UPFA parliamentary group meeting in the parliamentary complex today. At a special session on Monday, the Cabinet decided to draft the legislation on electoral reforms by Friday. According to the decision taken at the meeting, the members had proposed that 125 MPs should be elected on the FPP system, 75 on the District Proportional Representation system and 25 through the National List. This is basically the proposals submitted by the United National Party (UNP) the main constituent of the government.
However, the UPFA said the quota reserved under the FPP should be increased from the proposed 125.
UPFA General Secretary MP Susil Premajayantha said the UPFA was opposed to the preferential voting system.
"We will work out our amendments based on these two proposals and hand them over to the President," he said. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)
