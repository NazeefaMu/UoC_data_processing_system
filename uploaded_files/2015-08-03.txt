Govt. denies UPFA claims on highway
	
Highways and Investment Promotion Minister Kabir Hashim today denied the allegations levelled by the UPFA that the government had misappropriated funds allocated for the construction of the central expressway and had bypassed formalities when implementing the project.
UPFA former MPs Dullas Alahapperuma and Wimal Weerawansa charged the government led by the UNP had estimated to spend a staggering amount of Rs. 150 billion for the construction of the Kadawatha-Meerigama segment of the expressway but had reduced the number of lanes.
Minister Hashim said the charges of Mr. Alahapperuma were baseless and his charges prove that he lacks arithmetic knowledge.The Full Statement
The comments made by Mr. Dullas Alahapperuma at a recent Press Conference on the construction of the proposed central expressway from Kadawatha to Kandy, proves his poor knowledge in Arithmetic. He has got confused about the length of the proposed highway. The actual distance from Kadawatha ? Kossinna, Kossinna- Meerigama is 36.5 km and not 32 km. He has totally ignored the expenditure on the number of flyover bridges, constructions over conserved marshy lands thus disregarding the engineering factors.
When an estimate is prepared for a project, it is an accepted form of procedure, to prepare a basic minimum cost and call for tenders accordingly. The 120 billion Rupees mentioned here is the calculated amount based on the required engineering format. The accepted methodology is to calculate the cost of the construction from thereon. The first 4 km of Kadawatha ? Kossinna, Kossinna- Meerigama highway construction does not involve any cost to the government because the contractor had agreed to bear the cost of this stretch from the savings of the construction of outer Colombo circular highway. The balance 32.5 km of the Highway has been awarded to the Chinese company which the previous Government also had selected. The benefit that the country gained from the Yaha Palanaya Government is that it need not pay for the construction of the first 4 kilometers of the highway.
If Mr. Dullas Alahapperuma needs further information, he has only to inquire from the Chinese company to whom the contract was awarded by the previous government of which he was also a Minister.? Instead, Dullas has only resorted to applying the fundamentals of his brand of politics aimed at misleading and deceiving the public. ?
Dullas Alahaperuma should actually speak on the expenditure relating to the construction of Stage II of the Colombo outer circular road under Mahinda Rajapaksa. Rs. 5.3 billion had been spent on the construction of a distance of 9 km which is an increase of Rs. 550 million per km as against the construction of a Kilometre of Kadawatha-Kossinna-Meerigama highway. It is regrettable that Dullas Alahapperuma who was dumbstruck on the allegations made in Parliament and in media about the variations of project cost, on account of the reduction of traffic lanes in express highways constructed during the time of his government, now has suddenly got out of slumber and makes absurd comments.
The estimated cost per kilometer of the Southern Express Highway had been Rs.348 billion but Mahinda Rajapaksa Government spent Rs. 741 billion per kilometer.? The estimated cost of the construction of Katunayake Express Highway was Rs. 38 billion but actual cost had been Rs. 47.5 billion. We hope that Mr. Dullas Alahapperuma would clarify matters regarding this excess expenditure at his next press conference.? Also he will have to explain (as he is so much concerned about the construction of roadways) the manner in which funds collected from the people under? Uthuru Mithuru account was spent on the construction of the Northern railway track. It would be also pertinent to explain to the public about the railway power sets and carriages imported for use on this track but now dumped in the Dematagoda railway yard as those are not roadworthy. Mr. Kumara Welgama who succeeded Mr. Alahapperuma had stated that he would not bear responsibility for the corruption involved in the import of these power sets and carriages.
We also would like to remind Mr. Alahapperuma that people who purchased forward booking tickets to travel to Jaffna under the Uthuru Mithuru fund still await their turn. It will also be appreciated if he explains at the next Press Conference about the monies forcibly collected as day?s pay contribution to the Uthuru Mithuru fund from the public servants.? This proves beyond doubt that Dullas Alahapperuma has played the best acolyte role to Kurunegala District candidate Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa who states that the Best Head of State ? the Best rogue.

## Title: Pan Asia Bank posts record first half after-tax profit of Rs.451mn
## Section: Financial News
## Date: 3 August 2015 02:55 am
Pan Asia Bank posts record first half after-tax profit of Rs.451mn
	
Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC has posted a record after-tax profit of Rs.450.7 million for the first half of 2015 fiscal year (1H15), recording an increase of 156 percent from the corresponding period last year. This resulted in an earnings per share of Rs.3.08, risen from Rs.1.20 a year ago.?
This performance has amply been supported by the bank?s second quarter (2Q15) net profits, which grew by as much 204 percent to Rs.273.8 million.?
The bank has been able to record this exceptional performance due to strong growth in its loan book, improved margins and the closer tab on costs coupled with operational efficiencies achieved during the period.?
During the 1H15, the bank has grown its loans and receivables by 13.7 percent to Rs.72 billion while expanding its Net Interest Margin (NIM) to 4.49 percent from 3.82 percent six months ago, which could be considered as a significant feat.?
Pan Asia Bank closed the 2014 financial year expanding its loan book by 34 percent, among the highest credit growth by a Licensed Commercial Bank in the country.
Quite notably, the bank has doubled its return to its shareholders, the Return on Equity (ROE) from 9.81 percent to 18.38 percent within a very short span of six months. This is a commendable achievement at a time when industry interest margins are under pressure. ?
Commenting on the 1H15 financial performance, the bank?s Director and CEO Dimantha Seneviratne said this performance had been possible due to the bank?s well balanced, sustainable growth in all areas of retail, SME and corporate banking coupled with improved efficiency and commitment from all staff.?
?This is the highest profit after tax Pan Asia Bank has ever recorded in its history for the bank?s first half. In fact, we have achieved the whole of net profit we posted for the 2014 financial year (i.e.Rs.415.2 million) in just six months. We have achieved this despite making adequate provisions for loans and other losses.?
This robust performance we recorded in the first half with the contribution from all sectors is in line with our three-year strategic plan and also gives us the confidence to record even better performance going forward,? Seneviratne added.?Strong core-banking performance?
Demonstrating resilience to falling market interest rates, the bank has increased its 2Q15 Net Interest Income (NII) by as much as 78 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs.975.5 million while its NII for the 1H15 has risen by 46 percent YoY to Rs.1.83 billion.?
The increase in NII and the NIM further demonstrate the bank?s prudent asset and liability management, the timely re-pricing of products and re-calibrating funds into more remunerative areas.?
Further, it is expected that the strong pick up in credit growth in the economy will bode well for the bank to expand its core banking operations in the second half.?
Furthermore, the bank has made conscious efforts on improving the high yielding asset classes in its advances mix while identifying market niches where the bank could command a premium. This was amply supported by the bank?s innovative product portfolio.?
By the end of 1H15 the low cost funding base, Current and Savings Account (CASA) base stood at 29 percent, edged down from 30.5 percent by end-FY 2014. However, the bank will continue its efforts on increasing its CASA base.?A growing non-interest income base
The financials show that the bank has made concerted effort towards improving its non-fund based income sources. This can be seen as a prudent measure in a bid to ease off the over dependence on NII, which could come under pressure due to monetary and fiscal policy changes.?
The total non-fund based income has increased by a significant 31 percent YoY to Rs.430.6 million during the 2Q15 and by 36.6 percent YoY to Rs.844.6 million for the 1H15.?
The major share of this income came from the net fee and commission income which has risen by 36 percent YoY to Rs.382.9 million for the 1H15.?
Meanwhile, the other operating income has risen by 112 percent YoY to Rs.144.6 million during 2Q15 and by 113 percent to Rs.266.3 million, mainly due to gains from foreign exchange trading.
As a result, the total operating income ? NII and non-fund based income ? has risen by a strong 60 percent YoY to Rs.1.4 billion for the 2Q15 and 43 percent YoY to Rs.2.67 billion for the 1H15.?Efficiency enhancements at play
Due to concerted efforts, the bank has contained its cost to income ratio to 53.9 percent by end-1H15 from 55.32 percent in 1Q15 and 61 percent by end-FY 2014. ?
Meanwhile, quite notably, the bank has doubled its return on assets from 0.58 percent to 1.11 percent during the six months.?
During the 1H15 the personal expenses has risen by 23 percent YoY to Rs.659.4 million predominantly due to salary increments, other staff benefits and the increased investments on training and development.?
The bank has identified its human capital as one of its key assets and will continue to invest on training and development to make a formidable force in its drive to get into the next phase of growth.?
Depreciation and amortization has risen by 23 percent YoY to Rs.106.6 million for the 1H15 due to amortization charges related to the new core-banking system. ?
The bank has successfully migrated into Finacle core-banking system and the treasury system during the 1Q15 and 2Q15, respectively with significant capital investments that will further enhance the productivity of operations and the customer delivery efficiencies going forward.?
The bank will continue to focus on building up the information technology and digital banking platform to enhance customer delivery and to bring in cost efficiencies.?Balance sheet growth through quality portfolio
The Pan Asia Bank balance sheet recorded a total asset base of Rs.85.1 billion well supported by the 13.7 percent growth in its loans and receivables. Since the beginning of FY 2014, the bank has grown its balance sheet by 32 percent in 18 months.?
The loans and receivables, in absolute terms grew by as much as Rs.8.7 billion during 1H15. ?
Meanwhile, the rise in bank?s allowances for non-performing loans and other losses have been contained to just under 4 percent during the 1H15 to Rs.442.1 million from a year ago demonstrating the bank?s improving underwriting standards and credit quality. ?
By the end of 1H15, the gross and the net non-performance loan ratios stood at 5.9 percent and 4.28 percent, respectively.?
Meanwhile, the deposit base grew by 7 percent to Rs.69.7 billion under trying market conditions as the market interest rates were at historical lows.?
As of June 30, 2015, the regulatory Tier I and Tier II capital adequacy ratios stood at 7.03 percent and 11.49 percent respectively, above the regulatory minimums. ?Looking forward
Pan Asia Bank expects the pick-up in credit growth to continue to the remainder of the year.?
Further, with operational efficiencies and controls in place, along with its 78 branch network spread across the island, Pan Asia Bank is well poised to capitalize on its investments going forward. ?
Pan Asia Bank in 2015 celebrates 20 years of successful operations as a Licensed Commercial Bank in Sri Lanka and in 2014 the bank was adjudged as the ?Fastest Growing Commercial Bank in Sri Lanka - 2014? by the United Kingdom?s Global Banking and Finance Review.?

Will leave no room for separatism: MR
	
While warning the unitary character of the Constitution would be compromised under the rule of Prime Minister and UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, former President and UPFA Elections Committee Chairman Mahinda Rajapaksa today pledged he would leave no room for separatism.
He addressed an event held at the Vihara Maha Devi Park Open Theatre, where a collective of 61 civil organisations called Jathika Ekamuthuwa inked an agreement with Mr. Rajapaksa based on five conditions.
The conditions included:
?Rectifying of false amendments of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution; strengthening national security; providing ?real? economic relief to people; Taking measures to protect Buddhist heritage, and Creating an economy based on domestic production.?
The organizations had also included a special proposal to the agreement to conduct an investigation into the Halal issue and Aluthgama incidents, which led to a rift between the Sinhala and the Muslim communities and to take action against those responsible for these issues under a Rajapaksa administration.
Mr. Rajapaksa said Prime Minister Wickremesinghe had, in UNP election manifesto, pledged to create a new country and charged Mr. Wickremesinghe would exclude Northern and Eastern Provinces in the endeavour of creating a new country.
?As he pledged, Mr. Wickremesinghe will create a new country without the North and East in it. With the proposals of the TNA for a federal state, we are certain he would accomplish creating a new country. We are concerned that we might not be able to regain the country if this happened,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Seylan Bank 2Q net up by 54% over lower loan impairments, non-fund incomes
	
Seylan Bank PLC posted a net profit of Rs.1.05 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 (2Q15) recording an increase of 54 percent from a year ago, while for the six months ended June 30, 2015 (1H15) the group made a net profit of Rs.1.72 billion, up 42 percent from the same period last year, the interim results released to the Colombo Stock Exchange showed.?

During the 1H15, Seylan Bank?s loan and receivables (gross) portfolio grew by only Rs.7.3 billion, out of which Rs.3.5 billion came from leasing (Rs.2.4 billion) and overdrafts (Rs.1.1 billion).?
The net interest margin edged down to 4.59 percent from 4.92 percent six months before. However, the return on equity increased to 14.52 percent from 13.45 percent during the same period.?
The banking group, which consists of its 69.91 percent subsidiary Seylan Developments PLC, has an asset base of Rs.265.4 billion, which grew by 5.5 percent during the 1H15.?
Interest income remained unchanged while the interest expenses fell both during the 2Q15 and 1H15 due to re-pricing of the liabilities under the low interest rate environment. Seylan Bank low cost funding ratio, current and savings account ratio stood at 38 percent, close to industry average.?
During the 1H15 the deposits grew by just 2.4 percent or Rs.4.5 billion to Rs.190.4 billion.?

Sujeewa may be reliant on MR: Ravi
	
While denying any links with underworld gangsters, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said today said fellow candidate and Deputy Justice Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe might be reliant on ex-president Mahinda Rajapaksa for some reason because he denied Mr. Rajapaksa?s involvement in the Kotahena shooting.
?People like Thilanga Sumathipala, Dilan Perera and some of our party fellows are accusing me without having any credible factors. I have no links with the underworld gangsters because I don?t need them for my work. Ex-president Mahinda Rajapaksa was the one who had all the underworld connections and got work from them. My political path is clear and honest. Sujeewa might be depending on Mr. Rajapaksa whom he has white washed in the shooting incident? he said.
The minister told a media conference that those who level irresponsible and baseless allegations against him must undergo medical checkups.
While extending his condolences to the kith and kin of the two supporters Niroshan Sampath and Sithy Nasima who were killed in the shooting, the minister said they were not involved in any kind of underworld activities.
?Niroshan Sampath is a father of three children and an innocent carpet seller. Some media have misled the public by branding Niroshan Sampath as ?Army Sampath.? I don?t even know who ?Army Sampath? is. I am also a father of three children and I know how it feels. Please be careful before writing something. Do not discriminate the news items to get attention,? he told the media.
Mr. Karunanayake said the series of incidents including that of a remote control bomb being discovered in Balapitiya, a white van seized by the police in Mirihana, a dead body of a woman found at the Pettah bus stand and shooting at Kotahena leaving two dead and 11 others injured were masterminded by Mahinda Rajapaksa's gangsters to create a fear psychosis similar to the one that existed during the 10 year rule by inciting violence before the election.

Thajudeen's killing: CID seeks AG's advice
	
The CID which is investigating the death of former Havelocks Sports Club Rugby Captain and Sri Lanka Ruggerite Wasim Thajudeen has sought the Attorney General?s advice to exhume his body in connection with the magisterial inquiry, police sources said.
Police Media Spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara said the body would be exhumed based on the Attorney General?s advice and upon the receipt of a Court order.
Local media on Monday (3) reported that burial site of Mr. Thajudeen who died in May 2012 was being provided police protection.
On July 28, the Colombo Additional Magistrate ordered the Colombo Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) to submit the final and detailed postmortem report pertaining to the death of rugby player in court before September 10.
On Monday (27), the CID informed Court that Mr. Thajudeen's death was a homicide and not accidental.
The CID informed Court that the investigations conducted so far had revealed that his teeth and the bones in the pelvic region were broken and his neck pierced with a sharp instrument prior to his death. The CID said his leg muscles had been cut with a piece of broken class.
The CID said the government analyst's report and the postmortem report on the death appeared to be contradictory and that the death was not accidental but a homicide.
The former Havelocks SC rugby captain Wasim Thajudeen died in May 2012.
Earlier the police had said Mr. Thajudeen had lost control of his car and crashed into the wall of Shalika Grounds on Park Road, Narahenpita, and that his vehicle had exploded within seconds of the crash. (Lakmal Sooriyagoda)

	The TULF led by V. Anandasangari in its manifesto states states that all the ethnic groups should forget their differences and live in peace and harmony based on equal rights.
	It states that a solution based on the Indian model has been welcomed by both the Government and the Opposition.
	The TULF manifesto states that the political proposals of former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga can be acclaimed as the best solution ever offered and welcomed by many.
	?According to former Judge R. T. Vicknaraja this proposal was welcomed even by LTTE political advisor Anton Balasingam at the opening of the Kilinochchi Courts in 2002,? the TULF states.
	Meanwhile it said it did not support South Africa being assigned the role of facilitator in the evolution of a political solution. Instead, it looks to India to play a meaningful role.
	?From the time of Indira Gandhi up to the time of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Indian Government had intervened in efforts at resolving the Sri Lankan ethnic issue. It is the Indian Government which rushed helped Sri Lanka with medical teams and other assistance in the event of national disasters like Tsunami, etc. The TULF with all respects to South Africa will insist on India continuing its efforts to resolve the ethnic issue. If not India also will lose nterest,? the manifesto states.(Kelum Bandara)
