A request that goes against good governance
	
	This particular Diyawanna member who was at the forefront in the battle waged to oust the former Big Boss made an unusual request to the Compassionate One.
?Please allocate me a room at your Secretariat, because it will greatly facilitate my work,? he told the Compassionate One.
The Compassionate One rejected the request straightway. ?Allocating a room at my Secretariat to one particular Diyawanna member is unfair. I can be accused of being partisan,? he explained to the Diyawanna member, but the latter was not prepared to take ?no? for an answer. An argument ensued.? However, the Compassionate One put his foot down saying that he would not do anything that militated against good governance that they pledged to restore and uphold.

A stint in ?Siberia? for once powerful ministry secretary
	
	A female Ministry Secretary who was in the good books of the deposed Big Boss, is about to be exiled to Siberia of the state officialdom, they say.
The Ministry birds whisper that this lady was responsible for taking disciplinary action against the envoy who was a victim of a much publicized assault. What is worse is that she went the extra mile to whitewash the assailant, they say.
But this lady is one who is not prepared to accept defeat without a fight. She is said to be going round the political power circuit along with her husband these days? meeting the bigwigs of the Maithri regime in a bid to get an equally high profile job in the government. But those privy to the thinking of the government brass say that the poor lady is chasing a rainbow! ?

An irate local politico confronts ex-Minister
	
	There were a large number of politicos from both sides of the great divide at the funeral of the mother of the new one leading the opposition side at the Diyawanna House.
They were in little knots discussing the latest political developments and prognosticating what was yet to come.
Among the politicos present was a Minister who was looking after wildlife under the previous dispensation. He was chatting to several colleagues when a local politico belligerently barged in on the group and began berating him. The intruder charged that the former Minister had become so ungrateful overnight to the former Boss as to compare him to a dead body awaiting early disposal. The former Minister who was not prepared to be outdone hit back at the intruder with a vengence. Even choice obscenities flew back and forth during the heated exchange that ensured.
When the argument took an ugly turn, the embarrassed visitors disappeared from the scene one by one. The former Minister who realized that the local politico who hailed from the same area was not prepared to give way, he decided to end it his way. He abruptly turned his back on his antagonist and walked away

Borrowed coat saves the occasion
	
	
	A Diyawanna member looking after an electorate close to Puttalam received an unexpected call from the main Secretariat to call over there to take oaths as a Minister.
?Being given only one hour?s notice, the Diyawanna member hurriedly dressed up and rushed to the swearing-in ceremony.
Several political colleagues already present at the ceremony hailed the latest arrival and one of them remarked that the coat he was wearing was too tight for him and not befitting the occasion
The appointed time for swearing-in was only minutes away and he had no time to go anywhere to do a change.
Acting on a sudden brain wave he rushed to the section of the Secretariat where the staff were working.? He spotted a high official of just about his size ? in height and shoulder width ? went to him and told him that he wanted to borrow his coat for 10 minutes.? The official readily obliged.
And the Diyawanna member rushed back just on time to take his oaths!

Bungling officials poke bowling wound
	
	As if Sri Lanka team?s on-field problems were not enough, the bungling Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) officials have managed to complicate things by attempting to remove the team?s fast bowling coach Chaminda Vaas in a failed attempt to replace him with Champaka Ramanayake, but team sources in New Zealand told ?Daily Mirror? that the botched attempt only contributed to exacerbate the internal issues of the team with the World Cup a mere 18 days away.
	Ramanayake, who was succeeded by Vaas in February 2013, told our reporter Bipin Dani on Sunday that he had refused to take up the job at the given short notice, after our sister paper ?Sunday Times? revealed the SLC plans in an exclusive article.
	?I was approached by the Cricket board to join the team in New Zealand but could not accept the invitation owing to my family commitments,? Ramanayake told our reporter.
	Sri Lanka chief selector Sanath Jayasuriya who is currently in New Zealand with the team had initiated the move after extensive talks with the team head coach and the players.
	?Immediate attention to sort out various issues. With the World Cup around the corner, we have no choice but to address these issues and try our best to remedy them. In this context I would like to request you send Fast Bowling Coach Champaka Ramanayake to join the team immediately to start working with the fast bowlers,? Jayasuriya wrote to SLC on Saturday.
	?Furthermore Chaminda Vaas should be informed by you on the role that Champaka is expected to play coaching the fast bowlers,? he added.
	?Additionally I would recommend engaging the services of Stephen Flemming for the duration of the WC as a consultant which I think will be useful for the team, as such I will need your concurrence to engage his services. I could contact him while I am here in NZ if available and confirm same. Pls confirm both issues urgently,? Jayasuriya wrote further.
	SLC Secretary Nishantha Ranatunga had forwarded Jayasuriya?s mail to the other SLC officials adding that during a telephone discussion he and SLC Vice President Mohan de Silva had with team manager Michael de Zoysa, similar sentiments transpired.
	?Michael sent me an email last night requesting me to call him urgently and informed me of the issues faced by the fast bowlers at present and in a call conference with myself and Mohan he suggested that he too is of the same opinion as Sanath and they both recommend that Champaka Ramanayake be sent to NZ immediately considering the rest of the series and the World Cup,? Ranatunga wrote.
	?Further Sanath has suggested that he get in touch with Stephen Flemming and obtain his services as a consultant coach for the World Cup. Although Stephen was not available during the time SLC negotiated with him, suggest we approve Sanath to do it as he is already in NZ.?
	?Also considering the personal loss faced by Champaka some time back it is suggested that CEO and HOCO get in touch with Champaka and assist him in whatever way possible to organize his children?s affairs before leaving ie: transport as he may find it difficult to do so at short notice,? added Ranatunga.
	Ranatunga had also made it clear that Jayasuriya had verbally informed of his wish to have Ramanayake as head bowling coach and to have Vaas working under him. ?It is suggested by Sanath that SLC advice Vaas on the role that should be played by Champaka. During his conversation with me, he suggested that he prefers Champaka to act as Coach in charge of Fast Bowlers and Vaas to assist Champaka. It is suggested that CEO, HOCO and HOC convey same to Vaas in consultation with Sanath and Michael,? Ranatunga wrote in his letter.
	At this point, SLC President Jayantha Dharmadasa joined the conversation, revealing that it was he who actually mooted the entire plan to replace Vaas with Ramanayake, even before Jayasuriya suggested it.
	?I had already sent a mail out to all EXCO members yesterday expressing grave concern and to address this issue immediately by sending Champaka Ramanayake. Four have replied and since the others have not responded, it could be taken as agreed by all. So please go ahead with this move, now that we have got the views of Michael and Sanath as well, and make all necessary arrangements to send Champaka to New Zealand immediately and to recall Chaminda Vaas to Colombo,? wrote Dharmadasa.
	An hour later, in the mid-afternoon of Saturday, SLC Assistant Secretary Hirantha Perera, himself a top cricketer during his playing days, had joined the email exchange, pointing out that it may not be wise to sack Vaas in a hurried move, becoming the first to voice his concerns.
	?Chaminda Vaas is a National Icon and considered as one of the best fast bowlers ever produced by Sri Lanka. Barely few months back when we beat England in England in all 3 formats, everyone praised Vaas for his role in the fast bowling dept,? stated Perera.
	?When came to decide on the management team for NZ and WCC, everyone including Marvan, CEO and HOCO recommended Vaas and ExCo approved same,? he added.
	?Are we to believe that Vaas is the only cause and solely responsible for our performances during last few games?,? questioned Perera before explaining that it was not the correct way to treat an icon. ?Recalling Vaas is a slap on his face and moreover ending his career as a national FB coach. Are we doing the right thing with a person who has brought so much of honour and pride to SL cricket without a proper inquiry??,? questioned Perera.
	SLC firebrand Shammi Silva also sent a mail vehemently opposing the moves to replace Vaas and consult Stephen Fleming.
	?We have appointed Chaminda Vass as a bowling coach with consultation of selectors. Same way we had a big discussion and appointed Marvan as a coach,? he wrote, pointing out that appointment of Vaas was done after a careful procedure.
	?Who gave permission to Sanath to speak to Stephen Fleming? My opinion is, tell Sanath and them do correct selection and stay away from appointing different people. I totally reject of recommending of another fast bowling coach and consultant coach,? wrote Silva. Silva was angry about the planned changes. ?If they want appoint them send Vaas and Marvan to Sri Lanka. Tell selectors do the proper selection and stay with it, hence I totally Reject their request. I won?t be agreeable to their request,? wrote Silva who is also an SLC coaching committee member.
	However, another hour later, SLC Chief Executive Ashley de Silva conveyed to the members that Ramanayake had turned down the offer.
	?Reference to the discussion the President, Chairman of Selectors had with Champaka, please be informed that he has intimated to them that he is unable to accept the assignment due to personal reasons. The decision was conveyed to the Manager of the team and I have requested him to discuss same with Support staff and suggest some other alternative,? de Silva wrote.
	On November 25, Daily Mirror, in an exclusive article revealed that SLC Chief Executive Ashley de Silva had informed an emergency ex-co meeting that national team?s head coach Marvan Atapattu had demanded the removal of Vaas from the coaching team, saying that the former star left-arm bowler was not putting enough effort to improve fast bowling and his contribution during the ODI series against India was questionable.
	However, the issue was sorted out later and Vaas was allowed to continue with the team beyond the recent England series. (Channaka de Silva)

Bum steer leads to a bizarre plaything
	
	A Red party leader swung into action on a tip off given by a local party activist that there was a sea plane concealed in an outbuilding of the residential premises of the deposed Big Boss at Tangalle.
The authorities soon took action to locate in the vicinity of the suspected place of concealment a few security personnel in civvies for surveillance and dispatched a Police detail armed with a search warrant obtained from courts.
The housekeeper who was at the residence when the Police party arrived told them easily that they were free to look up every nook and corner of the premises. And the search operation began in earnest. Meanwhile, one officer in a raised voice announced that he spotted the sea plane behind an outbuilding.? The Police party who rushed to the spot were amazed to find a strange contraption which if viewed from a distance would look like some kind of aircraft. ?This is really a plaything for children,? the housekeeper who accompanied the officers explained. ?They can sit inside it and pedal it.? When it is pedaled, the blade fixed in front starts whirling like a rotor blade on a helicopter.?
Policemen of the search party who looked sheepish thanked the housekeeper and left the place in a hurry.

Choice of a symbol for coming election sets a poser
	
	
	Now that the Parliamentary elections are only three months away, the two main political parties, the UPFA and the UNP have already begun discussions on how they should face the impending challenge.
Both parties have found that they are beset with several minor problems which they should sort out before taking up the main task of gearing up the organizational machinery.
One of these minor problems common to both parties is choosing the party symbol for the coming elections.
One powerful section of the Betel leaf party has taken up the position that they stand a better chance of winning if they contest under the ?Hand? symbol. Another section maintains now that the voters are now so familiar with the Betel leaf symbol, it is to their advantage to continue with this symbol at future elections as well.
Meanwhile, the front-liners of the Green party are also split over the question of the symbol for the next general election.? The former chairman and the ones now in charge of Finance and the Foreign Affairs are holding a strong brief for contesting under the ?Swan? symbol. However, a large majority in the party prefer the party symbol, ?Elephant? to any other, they say.

	Nemesis is round the corner for a Sri Lanka Cricket bigwig who was involved in many a shady deal over several years in a row, they say.
Charges now being framed against him include engaging in corrupt practices both for appeasement of his political Masters and self-aggrandizement and resorting to machinations that victimized several leading national cricketers. However, he is busy these days cultivating good relations with government top brass in a bid to cover up his past sins.
A Diyawanna member of the Red party at a recent discussion with government top brass gave chapter and verse of the role played by this character in causing irreparable damage to the popular game. His past record with all juicy details is due to unfold shortly in the Diyawanna council, they say.

Chief Justice-43 Shirani Bandaranayake has resumed duties in the office of Chief Justice as there had been no legal removal of her from the post, Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) President Upul Jayasuriya said.
Dr. Bandaranayake arrived at the Superior Court complex at Hulftsdorp this afternoon and took office at the chambers of the Chief Justice, after she was welcomed by Mr. Jayasuriya.?There is no requirement for a new appointment therefore,? he told a news conference a short while ago and added that she will resign form her post tomorrow.
Lawyers of the Dr. Bandaranayake told the Daily Mirror that she had received a letter from the President?s office asking her to ?resume duties,? on grounds that she was not impeached lawfully and therefore no vacancy existed for the post of Chief Justice.?
Simultaneously, a letter had been sent to Chief Justice 44 Mohan Peiris to the effect that he had not been appointed as the Chief Justice and such appointment was void at its inception.?
The events unfolded after a protest was organised opposite the Supreme Court, with protestors marching and shouting slogans demanding the immediate ?removal? of the ?Chief Justice?.

Two Courts of the Supreme Court, 403 and 502 were in operation at the time. The Court in which the Chief Justice sits, 502 had postponed all matters that were listed for argument, after the news was confirmed.
At around 1 p.m. Dr. Bandaranayake walked into the complex through the Justice Ministry entrance and was welcomed by lawyers present.
She thereafter proceeded to the Chambers of the Chief Justice which was marked ?Chambers of the Chief Justice Hon. Mohan Peiris,? where many lawyers proceeded to wish her.?
Thereafter, the judges of the Supreme Court had also proceeded to welcome her at her Chambers. (Hafeel?Farisz)Video by Sanath Desmond

There is new hope for democracy in SL-Obama
	
	While claiming that India can play a positive role in helping countries like Sri Lanka forge a better future, US President Barack Obama said that there is a new hope for democracy in Sri Lanka.
	?Of course, as I?ve said before, with power comes responsibility. In this region, India can play a positive role in helping countries forge a better future, from Burma to Sri Lanka, where today there?s new hope for democracy," the US President said in Address to the People of India yesterday in New Delhi, India.
	Full speechPRESIDENT OBAMA:? Namaste!? (Applause.)? Thank you so much.? Thank you so much, Neha, for what a wonderful introduction.? (Applause.)? Everybody, please have a seat.? Nothing fills me with more hope than when I hear incredible young people like Neha and all the outstanding work that she?s doing on behalf of India?s youth and for representing this nation?s energy and its optimism and its idealism.? She makes me very, very proud.? And I?m sure -- I think they may be her -- is that somebody related to you?? Okay.? Because we just had a chance to meet, and she?s beaming with pride right now sitting next to you.? Give Neha a big round of applause once again.? (Applause.)
	?
	Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, to all the students and young people who are here today, to the people of India watching and listening across this vast nation -- I bring the friendship and the greetings of the American people.? On behalf of myself and Michelle, thank you so much for welcoming us back to India.? Bahoot dhanyavad.? (Applause.)? ?
	?
	It has been a great honor to be the first American President to join you for Republic Day.? With the tricolor waving above us, we celebrated the strength of your constitution.? We paid tribute to India?s fallen heroes.? In yesterday?s parade, we saw the pride and the diversity of this nation -- including the Dare Devils on their Royal Enfields, which was very impressive.? Secret Service does not let me ride motorcycles.? (Laughter.)? Especially not on my head.? (Laughter.)
	?
	I realize that the sight of an American President as your chief guest on Republic Day would have once seemed unimaginable.? But my visit reflects the possibilities of a new moment.? As I?ve said many times, I believe that the relationship between India and the United States can be one of the defining partnerships of this century.? When I spoke to your Parliament on my last visit, I laid out my vision for how our two nations can build that partnership.? And today, I want to speak directly to you -- the people of India -- about what I believe we can achieve together, and how we can do it.
	?
	My commitment to a new chapter between our countries flows from the deep friendship between our people.? And Michelle and I have felt it ourselves.? I recognized India with the first state visit of my presidency -- where we also danced to some pretty good Bhangra.? (Laughter.)? For the first time, we brought Diwali to the White House.? (Applause.)? On our last celebration here, we celebrated the Festival of Lights in Mumbai.? We danced with some children.? Unfortunately, we were not able to schedule any dancing this visit.? Senorita, bade-bade deshon mein.? You know what I mean.? (Laughter and applause.)? Everybody said, by the way, how much better a dance Michelle was than me -- (laughter) -- which hurt my feelings a little bit.? (Laughter.)
	?
	On a more personal level, India represents an intersection of two men who have always inspired me.? When Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was protesting racial segregation in the United States, he said that his guiding light was Mahatma Gandhi.? When Dr. King came to India, he said that being here -- in ?Gandhi?s land? -- reaffirmed his conviction that in the struggle for justice and human dignity, the most potent weapon of all is non-violent resistance.?? And those two great souls are why we can gather here together today, Indians and Americans, equal and free.
	?
	And there is another link that binds us.? More than 100 years ago, America welcomed a son of India -- Swami Vivekananda.? (Applause.)? And Swami Vivekananda, he helped bring Hinduism and yoga to our country.? And he came to my hometown of Chicago.? And there, at a great gathering of religious leaders, he spoke of his faith and the divinity in every soul, and the purity of love.? And he began his speech with a simple greeting:? ?Sisters and brothers of America.?
	?
	So today, let me say:? Sisters and brothers of India -- (applause) -- my confidence in what our nations can achieve together is rooted in the values we share.? For we may have our different histories and speak different languages, but when we look at each other, we see a reflection of ourselves.
	?
	Having thrown off colonialism, we created constitutions that began with the same three words -- ?we the people.?? As societies that celebrate knowledge and innovation, we transformed ourselves into high-tech hubs of the global economy.? Together, we unlock new discoveries -- from the particles of creation to outer space -- two nations to have gone to both the Moon and to Mars.? (Applause.)? And here in India, this dynamism has resulted in a stunning achievement.? You?ve lifted countless millions from poverty and built one of the world?s largest middle classes.
	?
	And nobody embodies this progress and this sense of possibility more than our young people.? Empowered by technology, you are connecting and collaborating like never before -- on Facebook and WhatsApp and Twitter.? And chances are, you?re talking to someone in America -- your friends, your cousins.? The United States has the largest Indian diaspora in the world, including some three million proud Indian-Americans.? (Applause.)? And they make America stronger, and they tie us together -- bonds of family and friendship that allow us to share in each other?s success.
	?
	For all these reasons, India and the United States are not just natural partners.? I believe America can be India?s best partner.? I believe that.? (Applause.)? Of course, only Indians can decide India?s role in the world.? But I?m here because I?m absolutely convinced that both our peoples will have more jobs and opportunity, and our nations will be more secure, and the world will be a safer and a more just place when our two democracies -- the world?s largest democracy and the world?s oldest democracy -- stand together.? I believe that.? (Applause.)
	?
	So here in New Delhi, Prime Minister Modi and I have begun this work anew.? And here?s what I think we can do together.? America wants to be your partner as you lift up the lives of the Indian people and provide greater opportunity.? So working together, we?re giving farmers new techniques and data -- from our satellites to their cell phones -- to increase yields and boost incomes.? We?re joining you in your effort to empower every Indian with a bank account.
	?
	And with the breakthroughs we achieved on this visit, we can finally move toward fully implementing our civil nuclear agreement, which will mean more reliable electricity for Indians and cleaner, non-carbon energy that helps fight climate change.?? (Applause.)? And I don?t have to describe for you what more electricity means.? Students being able to study at night; businesses being able to stay open longer and hire more workers; farmers being able to use mechanized tools that increase their productivity; whole communities seeing more prosperity.? In recent years, India has lifted more people out of poverty than any other country.? And now we have a historic opportunity with India leading the way to end the injustice of extreme poverty all around the world.? (Applause.)
	?
	America wants to be your partner as you protect the health of your people and the beauty of this land, from the backwaters of Kerala to the banks of Ganges.? As we deliver more energy, more electricity, let?s do it with clean, renewable energy, like solar and wind.? And let?s put cleaner vehicles on the road and more filtration systems on farms and villages.? Because every child should be able to drink clean water, and every child should be able to breathe clean air.? (Applause.)? We need our young people healthy for their futures.? And we can do it.? We have the technology to do it.
	?
	America wants to be your partner in igniting the next wave of Indian growth.? As India pursues more trade and investment, we want to be first in line.? We?re ready to join you in building new infrastructure -- the roads and the airports, the ports, the bullet trains to propel India into the future.? We?re ready to help design ?smart cities? that serve citizens better, and we want to develop more advanced technologies with India, as we do with our closest allies. ?
	?
	We believe we can be even closer partners in ensuring our mutual security.? And both our nations have known the anguish of terrorism, and we stand united in the defense of our people.? And now we?re deepening our defense cooperation against new challenges.? The United States welcomes a greater role for India in the Asia Pacific, where the freedom of navigation must be upheld and disputes must be resolved peacefully.? And even as we acknowledge the world as it is, we must never stop working for the world as it should be -- a world without nuclear weapons.? That should be a goal for all of us.? (Applause.)
	?
	I believe that if we?re going to be true global partners, then our two nations must do more around the world together.? So to ensure international security and peace, multilateral institutions created in the 20th century have to be updated for the 21st.? And that?s why I support a reformed United Nations Security Council that includes India as a permanent member.? (Applause.)? ?
	?
	Of course, as I?ve said before, with power comes responsibility.? In this region, India can play a positive role in helping countries forge a better future, from Burma to Sri Lanka, where today there?s new hope for democracy.? With your experience in elections, you can help other countries with theirs.? With your expertise in science and medicine, India can do more around the world to fight disease and develop new vaccines, and help us end the moral outrage of even a single child dying from a preventable disease.? Together, we can stand up against human trafficking and work to end the scourge of modern day slavery.? (Applause.)? ?
	?
	And being global partners means confronting the urgent global challenge of climate change.? With rising seas, melting Himalayan glaciers, more unpredictable monsoons, cyclones getting stronger -- few countries will be more affected by a warmer planet than India.? And the United States recognizes our part in creating this problem, so we?re leading the global effort to combat it.? And today, I can say that America?s carbon pollution is near its lowest level in almost two decades.
	?
	I know the argument made by some that it?s unfair for countries like the United States to ask developing nations and emerging economies like India to reduce your dependence on the same fossil fuels that helped power our growth for more than a century.? But here?s the truth:? Even if countries like the United States curb our emissions, if countries that are growing rapidly like India -- with soaring energy needs -- don't also embrace cleaner fuels, then we don?t stand a chance against climate change.
	?
	So we welcome India?s ambitious targets for generating more clean energy.? We?ll continue to help India deal with the impacts of climate change -- because you shouldn?t have to bear that burden alone.? As we keep working for a strong global agreement on climate change, it's young people like you who have to speak up, so we can protect this planet for your generation.? I'll be gone when the worst effects happen.? It's your generation and your children that are going to be impacted.? That's why it's urgent that we begin this work right now.
	?
	Development that lifts up the lives and health of our people.? Trade and economic partnerships that reduce poverty and create opportunity.? Leadership in the world that defends our security, and advances human dignity, and protects our planet -- that?s what I believe India and America can do together.? So with the rest of my time, I want to discuss how we can do it.? Because in big and diverse societies like ours, progress ultimately depends on something more basic, and that is how we see each other.? And we know from experience what makes nations strong.
	And Neha I think did a great job of describing the essence of what?s important here.
	?
	We are strongest when we see the inherent dignity in every human being.? Look at our countries -- the incredible diversity even here in this hall.? India is defined by countless languages and dialects, and every color and caste and creed, gender and orientations.? And likewise, in America, we?re black and white, and Latino and Asian, and Indian-American, and Native American.? Your constitution begins with the pledge to uphold ?the dignity of the individual.?? And our Declaration of Independence proclaims that ?all men are created equal.?
	?
	In both our countries, generations have worked to live up to these ideals.? When he came to India, Martin Luther King, Jr. was introduced to some schoolchildren as a ?fellow untouchable.?? My grandfather was a cook for the British army in Kenya.? The distant branches of Michelle?s family tree include both slaves and slave owners.? When we were born, people who looked like us still couldn?t vote in some parts of the country.? Even as America has blessed us with extraordinary opportunities, there were moments in my life where I?ve been treated differently because of the color of my skin.
	?
	Many countries, including the United States, grapple with questions of identity and inequality, and how we treat each other, people who are different than us, how we deal with diversity of beliefs and of faiths.? Right now, in crowded neighborhoods not far from here, a man is driving an auto-rickshaw, or washing somebody else?s clothes, or doing the hard work no one else will do.? And a woman is cleaning somebody else?s house.? And a young man is on a bicycle delivering lunch. A little girl is hauling a heavy bucket of water.? And I believe their dreams, their hopes, are just as important, just as beautiful, just as worthy as ours.? And so even as we live in a world of terrible inequality, we?re also proud to live in countries where even the grandson of a cook can become President, or even a Dalit can help write a constitution, and even a tea seller can become Prime Minister.? (Applause.)
	?
	The point is, is that the aim of our work must be not to just have a few do well, but to have everybody have a chance, everybody who is willing to work for it have the ability to dream big and then reach those dreams.
	?
	Our nations are strongest when we uphold the equality of all our people -- and that includes our women.? (Applause.)? Now, you may have noticed, I?m married to a very strong and talented woman.? (Applause.)? Michelle is not afraid to speak her mind, or tell me when I?m wrong -- which happens frequently.? (Laughter.) And we have two beautiful daughters, so I?m surrounded by smart, strong women.? And in raising our girls, we?ve tried to instill in them basic values -- a sense of compassion for others, and respect for themselves, and the confidence that they can go as far as their imaginations and abilities will carry them.? And as part of Michelle?s work as First Lady, she?s met with women and girls around the world, including here in India, to let them know that America believes in them, too.
	?
	In the United States, we?re still working to make sure that women and girls have all the opportunities they deserve, and that they?re treated equally.? And we have some great role models, including here today the former speaker of our House of Representatives -- Nancy Pelosi -- (applause) -- the first woman speaker of the House, and my great partner.? (Applause.)
	?
	And here in India, it?s the wives and the mothers who so often hold families and communities together.? Indian women have shown that they can succeed in every field -- including government, where many of your leaders are women.? And the young women who are here today are part of a new generation that is making your voice heard, and standing up and determined to play your part in India?s progress.
	?
	And here?s what we know.? We know from experience that nations are more successful when their women are successful.? (Applause.)? When girls go to school -- this is one of the most direct measures of whether a nation is going to develop effectively is how it treats its women.? When a girl goes to school, it doesn?t just open up her young mind, it benefits all of us -- because maybe someday she?ll start her own business, or invent a new technology, or cure a disease.? And when women are able to work, families are healthier, and communities are wealthier, and entire countries are more prosperous.? And when young women are educated, then their children are going to be well educated and have more opportunity.
	?
	So if nations really want to succeed in today?s global economy, they can?t simply ignore the talents of half their people.? And as husbands and fathers and brothers, we have to step up -- because every girl?s life matters.? Every daughter deserves the same chance as our sons.? Every woman should be able to go about her day -- to walk the streets or ride the bus -- and be safe, and be treated with respect and dignity.? (Applause.)? She deserves that.? (Applause.)
	? ?
	And one of the favorite things about this trip for me has been to see all these incredible Indian women in the armed forces, including the person who commanded the Guard that greeted me when I arrived.? (Applause.)? It's remarkable, and it's a sign of great strength and great progress.
	?
	Our nations are strongest when we see that we are all God?s children -- all equal in His eyes and worthy of His love.? Across our two great countries we have Hindus and Muslims, Christians and Sikhs, and Jews and Buddhists and Jains and so many faiths.? And we remember the wisdom of Gandhiji, who said, ?for me, the different religions are beautiful flowers from the same garden, or they are branches of the same majestic tree.?? (Applause.)??? Branches of the same majestic tree.
	?
	Our freedom of religion is written into our founding documents.? It?s part of America?s very first amendment.? Your Article 25 says that all people are ?equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practice and propagate religion.?? In both our countries -- in all countries
	-- upholding this fundamental freedom is the responsibility of government, but it's also the responsibility of every person.
	?
	In our lives, Michelle and I have been strengthened by our Christian faith.? But there have been times where my faith has been questioned -- by people who don?t know me -- or they?ve said that I adhere to a different religion, as if that were somehow a bad thing.? Around the world, we?ve seen intolerance and violence and terror perpetrated by those who profess to be standing up for their faith, but, in fact, are betraying it.? No society is immune from the darkest impulses of man.? And too often religion has been used to tap into those darker impulses as opposed to the light of God.? Three years ago in our state of Wisconsin, back in the United States, a man went to a Sikh temple and, in a terrible act of violence, killed six innocent people -- Americans and Indians.? And in that moment of shared grief, our two countries reaffirmed a basic truth, as we must again today -- that every person has the right to practice their faith how they choose, or to practice no faith at all, and to do so free of persecution and fear and discrimination.? (Applause.)
	?
	The peace we seek in the world begins in human hearts.? And it finds its glorious expression when we look beyond any differences in religion or tribe, and rejoice in the beauty of every soul.? And nowhere is that more important than India.? Nowhere is it going to be more necessary for that foundational value to be upheld.? India will succeed so long as it is not splintered along the lines of religious faith -- so long as it's not splintered along any lines -- and is unified as one nation.
	And it?s when all Indians, whatever your faith, go to the movies and applaud actors like Shah Rukh Khan.? And when you celebrate athletes like Milkha Singh or Mary Kom.? And every Indian can take pride in the courage of a humanitarian who liberates boys and girls from forced labor and exploitation -- who is here today -- Kailash Satyarthi.? (Applause.)? Our most recent winner of the Nobel Prize for Peace.? (Applause.)
	?
	So that's what unifies us:? Do we act with compassion and empathy.? Are we measured by our efforts -- by what Dr. King called ?the content of our character? rather than the color of our skin or the manner in which we worship our God.? In both our countries, in India and in America, our diversity is our strength.? And we have to guard against any efforts to divide ourselves along sectarian lines or any other lines.? And if we do that well, if America shows itself as an example of its diversity and yet the capacity to live together and work together in common effort, in common purpose; if India, as massive as it is, with so much diversity, so many differences is able to continually affirm its democracy, that is an example for every other country on Earth.? That's what makes us world leaders -- not just the size of our economy or the number of weapons we have, but our ability to show the way in how we work together, and how much respect we show each other. ?
	And, finally, our nations are strongest when we empower our young people ?- because ultimately, you're the one who has to break down these old stereotypes and these old barriers, these old ways of thinking.? Prejudices and stereotypes and assumptions -- those are what happens to old minds like mine.? I'm getting gray hair now.? I was more youthful when I first started this office.? And that?s why young people are so important in these efforts.
	?
	Here in India, most people are under 35 years old.? And India is on track to become the world?s most populous country.? So young Indians like you aren?t just going to define the future of this nation, you?re going to shape the world.? Like young people everywhere, you want to get an education, and find a good job, and make your mark.? And it?s not easy, but in our two countries, it?s possible.
	?
	Remember, Michelle and I don't come from wealthy backgrounds or famous families.? Our families didn?t have a lot of money.? We did have parents and teachers and communities that cared about us.? And with the help of scholarships and student loans, we were able to attend some of best schools of the world.? Without that education, we wouldn?t be here today.? So whether it?s in America, or here in India, or around the world, we believe young people like you ought to have every chance to pursue your dreams, as well.
	?
	So as India builds new community colleges, we?ll link you with our own, so more young people graduate with the skills and training to succeed.? We?ll increase collaborations between our colleges and universities, and help create the next India institute of technology.? We?ll encourage young entrepreneurs who want to start a business.? And we?ll increase exchanges, because I want more American students coming to India, and more Indian students coming to America.? (Applause.)? And that way, we can learn from each other and we can go further.? Because one other thing we have in common Indians and Americans are some of the hardest working people on Earth.? (Applause.)
	?
	And I?ve seen that -- Michelle and I have seen that in a family here in India.? I just want to tell you a quick story.? On our last visit here, we visited Humayun?s Tomb.? And while we were there, we met some of the laborers who are the backbone of this nation?s progress.? We met their children and their families as well -- and some wonderful young children with bright smiles, sparks in their eyes.? And one of the children we met was a boy named Vishal.
	?
	And today, Vishal is 16 years old.? And he and his family live in South Delhi, in the village of Mor Band.? (Applause.)? And his mother works hard in their modest home, and his sister is now in university; she wants to become a teacher.? His brother is a construction worker earning his daily wage.? And his father works as a stone layer, farther away, but sends home what little he makes so Vishal can go to school.? And Vishal loves math, and mostly, he studies.? And when he?s not studying, he likes watching kabaddi.? And he dreams of someday joining the Indian armed forces.? (Applause.)? And we're grateful that Vishal and his family joined us today.? We're very proud of him, because he?s an example of the talent that?s here.? And Vishal?s dreams are as important as Malia and Sasha?s dreams, our daughters.? And we want him to have the same opportunities.
	?
	Sisters and brothers of India, we are not perfect countries. And we?ve known tragedy and we've known triumph.? We?re home to glittering skyscrapers, but also terrible poverty; and new wealth, but also rising inequality.? We have many challenges in front of us.? But the reason I stand here today, and am so optimistic about our future together, is that, despite our imperfections, our two nations possess the keys to progress in the century ahead.? We vote in free elections.? We work and we build and we innovate.? We lift up the least among us.? We reach for heights previous generations could not even imagine.? We respect human rights and human dignity, and it is recorded in our constitutions.?? And we keep striving to live up to those ideals put to paper all those years ago.
	?
	And we do these things because they make our lives better and safer and more prosperous.? But we also do them because our moral imaginations extend beyond the limits of our own lives.? And we believe that the circumstances of our birth need not dictate the arc of our lives.? We believe in the father working far from home sending money back so his family might have a better life.? We believe in the mother who goes without so that her children might have something more.? We believe in the laborer earning his daily wage, and the student pursuing her degree.? And we believe in a young boy who knows that if he just keeps studying, if he?s just given the chance, his hopes might be realized, too.
	?
	We are all ?beautiful flowers from the same garden?branches of the same majestic tree.?? And I'm the first American President to come to your country twice, but I predict I will not be the last.? (Applause.)? Because, as Americans, we believe in the promise of India.? We believe in the people of India.? We are proud to be your friend.? We are proud to be your partner as you build the country of your dreams.
	?
	Jai Hind!? (Applause.)? Thank you.

157 SL asylum seekers legally detained at sea
	
	A group of 157 Sri Lankan asylum seekers were legally detained at sea by Australian authorities last year, the High Court finds.
	The asylum seekers were picked up and held on a Customs boat for nearly a month last June after leaving a port at Pondicherry in southern India.
	They were eventually taken to Nauru after efforts to return them to India failed.
	Lawyers for the group argued the detention outside Australia was illegal and at odds with international obligations, and their treatment on the Customs boat was inhumane and cruel.
	Asylum seeker advocates were concerned over changes to legislation made late last year that could make it difficult to challenge boat turn-backs and detention at sea in the future.
	The changes meant detention powers can not be ruled invalid on the basis of international obligations.
	The High Court found the Government acted lawfully and the group was not entitled to damages.(abc.net.au)

Video: Elephant calf allegedly kept illegally inside temple premises
	
In what is thought to be a clear violation of rules, a two and half year-old elephant calf had been found inside the Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple in Polhengoda this evening along with another 20-year-old female elephant that was also being kept at the temple.
The raid was conducted on the instructions of Deputy Minister Wasantha Senanayake, who had arrived at the spot accompanied by wild life officials and the police after receiving a tip-off that elephant were being kept in the temple premises illegally.
When the minister requested legal documents proving the ownership of the elephants from the chief incumbent of the temple he said he did not have any.? The chief incumbent had said that he would give them the license as soon as he found them.
The minister said that these elephants would be taken to the wildlife department by the officials and they would take the steps needed to relocate them in the wild.
Statements had been recorded from several people including the Grama Sevaka of the area, a mahout that had been kept there to look after the pachyderms as well as several others.
Legal documents could be obtained to keep baby elephants more than six-years-old but keeping calves of a lesser age in ones possession was illegal, the wild life officials said. They warned that they would be cracking down on those who do not adhere to this rule and said that those persons who own young elephant calves without a proper license were requested to hand them over to the government.

	Former great Rumesh Ratnayake has agreed to take up coaching the Sri Lanka fast bowlers till the World Cup tournament starts, SLC sources told ?Daily Mirror? yesterday.
	Following a suggestion by Chief National Selector Sanath Jayasuriya, SLC Chief Executive Ashley de Silva had successfully negotiated with Ratnayake to obtain his services to work with the players from February 1 to 14.
	Jayasuriya had discussed the appointment of Ratnayake with the national team management which had endorsed it. Chaminda Vaas would remain with the team and would guide the fast bowlers during the duration of the World Cup tournament.
	Sources said that the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) under which Ratnayake is currently in employment has agreed to release him for the duration. SLC President Jayantha Dharmadasa is also the president of the ACC.
	Sri Lanka team has been given a short break after the current tour of New Zealand from January 31 to February 7. However, de Silva told ?Daily Mirror? that the fast bowlers will have training sessions while only some of the players have been granted the break. He said that those players who have been excused will travel to Australia for the break.
	The source questioned the sanity of the move as Ratnayake would barely have time to do a miracle which Vaas was unable to do, though the appointment may cost close to an additional Rs. Two million to SLC.

Qatar airways voted Business Air line of the year for second year in a row
	
	<U+200B>Qatar Airways was last week awarded ?Business Airline of the Year? for the second consecutive year at the prestigious UK Business Travel Awards 2015 held in London at the Grosvenor House Hotel.
	?
The 20th annual Business Travel Awards, hosted by Buying Business Travel, celebrated the achievements of travel industry leaders. Over 70 companies, teams and individuals were shortlisted across 21 categories.?
In May 2014, Qatar Airways became the first carrier to fly an all-Business Class service from London Heathrow. The daily Airbus A319 service to Doha is configured with a single aisle, 2-2 seating configuration offering 40 seats. The service departs from Terminal 4 at 21:55, arriving into Doha at 6.40am the following day. The A319 Business Class seat has one of the highest specifications for business class travel of any airline with wide seats that recline into fully flat beds.

This award reiterates the quality of our renowned 5-star service and it is an honour to have been recognised in this category again.?
The airline celebrated a dramatic increase to its fleet in 2014, taking delivery of three new aircraft types: the A319 all-Business Class; the Airbus A380, and was the Global Launch Customer of the A350.
With the receipt of these new aircraft, Qatar Airways is the only airline in the world to operate every family of Airbus? modern airline portfolio.

Dual Executive System
	
	The ruling coalition has reached consensus on the proposed constitutional amendment that will primarily seek to introduce a dual executive system of governance and on the re-instating of the independent commissions, political sources said yesterday.
	The proposed formula will be presented in Parliament early next month to be discussed with the main opposition.
	A special committee, comprising President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and representatives of other parties including the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), has worked out these constitutional proposals.
	In the event that these constitutional reforms are enacted, President Sirisena will remain as the Head of State, but with reduced powers. He will retain the defence portfolio and the power to appointment provincial governors and on several other subjects including that of appointing the heads of Sri Lanka?s diplomatic missions abroad.
	According to political sources, the Prime Minister will be the Head of the Cabinet thus making it a dual executive system of governance.
	The appointment of members to the independent commissions will be done by a committee comprising the Speaker, the Prime Minister, the Opposition Leader, five members nominated by the Prime Minister and the Opposition Leader, and the representative nominated by minor parties. In this exercise, the Prime Minister and the Opposition Leader will be authorized to appoint their five nominees based on Sri Lanka?s professional and social diversity, rather than on ethnic diversity.
	A similar system existed under the 17th Amendment to the Constitution. But, it was scrapped with the enactment of the 18th Amendment. (Kelum Bandara)
