A dispute over a mug on a poster
	
An objection made to the display of the mug of a certain politico on an SLTB poster has led to the printing of a new set of posters at a huge additional cost.
A poster displaying the mug shots of several political stalwarts from both the Green and Betel Leaf parties had been brought out recently to mark the launching of a coordinated operation schedule to be held in the Wayamba province. A provincial purohita had flown into a rage on seeing the mug shot of a particular politico on the poster and had demanded the withdrawal of the poster and the display of a new one sans that of the politico he objected to.
Employees in the public transport sector in Wayamba say that it was a crime to have new posters printed at a huge cost to pander to the whims of a political authority.

Curd for skin treatment!
	

This coordinating secretary of a purohita maintains cordial relations with the Ministry staff. Whenever he goes outstation on official duty he makes it a point to buy the kinds of fruits, nuts and delicacies available in the area he visits to treat them on his return to office.

This secretary made a visit to the South recently and he wanted to buy several pots of curd for his staff, but he could buy only one pot due to an unexpected shortage of the stuff.
He took the pot of curd with him on his return to the office. As the quantity of curd was too little to go round, he presented it to a girl who was on an in-service training stint in his office.
The following morning the coordinating secretary asked the girl: How was the curd I gave you yesterday Did it taste good
I didnt eat it, Sir
Why
I daubed a good coating of it on the face!
What You plastered your face with curd without eating it
Yes, Sir. Fresh curd, they say, is a good skin treatment. It gives a shine to your face if you apply a good coating!
The secretary and the other employees who heard the girls reply had a hearty laugh over it, they say.

Dayan Jayatilake replies to Mangala
	
Sri Lankas former Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva, Dayan Jayatilake has sent the following statement as a right of reply to the statement made by Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera since Mr. Jayatilake's name has been mentioned.
I write to refute a statement made with direct reference to me, by Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera in the course of his response to former President Rajapaksa in the newspapers of Monday August 1, 2016 under the caption Enough is Enough, he said.
The following is his reply: "I have no intention of replying to Minister Samaraweeras counter-critique of President Rajapaksas critical remarks on the structure of the Office of Missing Persons. However, as a student of comparative international politics I cannot help but note that Minister Samaraweeras model of the OMP derives from contexts that are very different to that of Sri Lanka and thus has little relevance to us. The OMP derives from mechanisms for investigation into persons missing under military juntas in Latin America or mechanisms set up, also mainly in Latin America, in consequence of negotiated settlements arrived at, usually with external mediation/facilitation, between guerrilla movements and incumbent regimes.
Sri Lankas context is drastically different, i.e. that of a democratic state, with democratically elected governments, and whose legitimate armed forces fought a war strictly within its borders, against a terrorist enemy and won an outright victory. In no such context has there been a mechanism structured as the OMP is.
Nowhere in Asia, in the aftermath of war or even transitions from prolonged military regimes, has a mechanism such as the OMP been set up. Quite apart from Asia, even in liberal democratic Spain, an EU and NATO member, there isnt anything remotely like the OMP to investigate into disappearances during the Civil War.
One cannot help but point out that the morally laudable and ethically necessary quest from any humanistic and humanitarian perspective--for closure for the families and loved ones of missing persons, has already been carried out by the Maxwell Paranagama Commission. Any lacuna could have addressed by a renewed and modified mandate for that Commission. One fails to grasp the logic of the new structure, the OMP.
That said, may I move on to the point made with direct reference to me by the Hon. Minister. He writes:
This was also evident when he [President Mahinda Rajapaksa] and UN Secretary-General Ban-Ki Moon agreed to an accountability process in their 2009 Joint Communique, which was later made into a formal commitment to the entire international community via the 2009 Geneva resolution when Dayan Jayatilleka was Sri Lankas ambassador in Geneva.
To use diplomatic language, I shall content myself by saying that the Honorable Ministers statement is entirely without foundation in fact and fails to either correspond with empirical reality or accord with logic.
A smidgeon of logic alone should make Minister Samaraweera wonder why the resolutions moved by the US in the UNHRC on Sri Lanka in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015, made no mention whatsoever to the Resolution of May 2009. Surely, if Minister Samaraweera were right and he is grappling with a legacy of President Rajapaksas and my commitments to the international community in May 2009, then the subsequent resolutions, all of which commence with a preamble establishing continuity and locating itself in an institutional context, should have made some reference to the UNHRC resolution of May 2009. The fact that they do not, make amply clear to any logical mind, that there is no continuity with the UNHRC resolution of May 2009.
Foreign Minister Samaraweera and his Prime Minister must stop telling untruths on the public record that President Mahinda Rajapaksa agreed to an accountability mechanism-they sometimes say an international investigation  in his May 23, 2009 Joint Statement with Ban Ki Moon and later in the May 2009 Resolution in favor of Sri Lanka which obtained a near-two thirds majority in the UN Human Right Council.
The understandings contained therein (in that Joint Statement) were that the Government would take unspecified measures to address grievances regarding an accountability process with regard to human rights and humanitarian law violations. It merely and blandly stated that the Government will take measures to address those grievances. This is hardly a smoking gun! There is no statement to the effect that the UN S-G and the Government of Sri Lanka agreed on any accountability approach or measures. There is no evidence of any commitment to an accountability mechanism, domestic, international or hybrid. Indeed it is a semantic model of anodyne diplomatic ambiguity.
Our victory in the vote in May 2009 did not put or retain Sri Lanka on the agenda of the UN HRC. The EU driven Special Session did, but our diplomatic victory removed it from the agenda and there was no further action mandated-- not even the need to report back to the Council.
That is why even Callum Macrae of Channel 4 laments as late as November 2014 that the Rajapaksa regime pulled off a stunning coup when it gained 29 votes for a resolution congratulating them on their victory.
The LLRC and the Disappearances Commission are the measures that the previous Government took, as promised, to address those grievances. That Governments lapse was in failing to fully implement the LLRC report. That is pretty much all the new government had to do. The return of Sri Lanka to the UN HRC agenda has therefore to be sourced in the actions or inactions  the sins of commission and omission in the years following the UNHRC success of May 2009, i.e. the post-war years. It has nothing to do with the UNHRC resolution of May 2009."

However, the OIC has incurred the wrath of a powerful purohita hailing from the same area for refusing to go soft on his political lackeys engaged in illicit logging and sand mining on a massive scale.
Meanwhile, a rumour abuzz in the area says that the purohita is pulling every possible wire to have the OIC transferred out to a faraway station.

Port City: Indian pressure forced SL to suspend and revisit project: Rajitha
	
Cabinet Spokesman and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne revealed today that the Chinese funded Port City Project (PCP) initiated by the Mahinda Rajapaksa government had to be suspended and re-visited under pressure from India.
He told the weekly Cabinet news briefing that a new tripartite contract would be signed shortly with all clauses in the original agreement inimical or unfavourable to Sri Lanka being removed with new conditions included.
There was opposition to the project from several quarters leading to the UNP vowing to suspend it on assuming office. However, it was the Indian government that forewarned Sri Lanka of the negatives in the event Sri Lanka went ahead. India said once completed, the project will not come under the jurisdiction of Sri Lanka with a big question mark on Sri Lankas sovereignty, the minister said.
He said India had pointed out that the project management could refuse landing rights to Sri Lankas aircraft on the properties under its purview and prohibit the use of its air space.
Under the new tripartite agreement to be signed by the China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd (CHEC), a subsidiary of the of the China Communications and Constructions Company Ltd (CCCC), the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry and the Urban Development Authority (UDA) has removed the contentious issues in the original contract.
For instance, according to the agreement signed in September 2014 by the Rajapaksa government, 20 hectares of land was be granted to the CHEC Port City (Pvt) Ltd on a freehold basis and the rest on 99-year lease. The new government has decided that no land will be given on freehold basis but on 99-year lease.
Under the new agreement the above has expanded in favour of the GOSL to include healthcare and hospitals and exhibition and convention centres and the new Colombo International Financial Centre. Also no restrictions will be placed on developing the North and West ports of the Colombo Harbour. In addition, the project company has agreed to set up the CIFC building in the land area reclaimed first including making a new investment in the CIFC building no sooner it is technically feasible to build on reclaimed land and upon mutually acceptable terms being agreed with the GOSL after a feasibility study.

Speaker signs RTI bill into law
	
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya placed his signature on the much-awaited Right to Information (RTI) Bill which was unanimously approved by Parliament on June 24, Mass Media and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Gayantha Karunatilaka said today.
He told the weekly cabinet news briefing that the RTI would be made a fundamental right of the media and the people by incorporating it in the statute book.
The minister said a fully independent Media Commission will be established to ensure media freedom in Sri Lanka and as such the suppression, refusal or depriving of any official information to the media or to a citizen by any public official would be considered a violation of fundamental rights, the right of a journalist and the Right to Information Act.
"However, any one can complain to the Human Rights Commission if he or she was deprived of this right but the Independent Information Commission will have more legal teeth to deal with those who violate the Right to Information Act," the minister said.
He said clauses to safeguard national security, territorial integrity and sovereignty of the country have been included in the draft Bill and information pertaining to those vital areas would remain out of bounds, to the media or the people, which is an accepted norm in any country.
"With the incorporation of the Right to Information Act in the Constitution, all government circulars issued up to now restricting the dissemination of information to the media will be made ineffective," the minister said.
He said journalists would have a bigger role to play with responsibility and decorum to protect the dignity and ethics of the media while enjoying the fully fledged independence through self-regulation, self-censorship and ethical guidelines if they are to benefit fully from this exercise.

We could enrich our nation through dialogue: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday that it was only through engaging in dialogue and accepting the convergences of these systems and cultures that we could enrich our own nation at a time when social equities and equalities of market economies as well as religious extremism had come to the forefront.
Mr. Wickremesinghe expressed these views addressing the 12th World Islamic Economic Forum held yesterday in Jakarta, Indonesia.
"I would like to conclude by proposing to you a vision of convergence for our future - a convergence of our heritages from our historic trading past, the multiple forces of globalization and secular western economic models, our own religious ethics and practices, and the challenges and opportunities of the present times that are inextricably interwoven with the future of Islamic and secular societies worldwide," he said.
"The Islamic nations of the world have, by and large, weathered the economic storm far better than other countries. Being blessed with a vast array of natural resources that have been judiciously harnessed to bring rapid economic and social progress to your societies, the Islamic crescent of nations stretching from Africa to South East Asia has seen progress and prosperity for several decades," he said.
Excerpts from the Prime Minister's speech:
We must not forget that a key driver of growth for the entire Asian region will be the expansion of intra-Asian trade in the coming century. And, I see significant advances in the liberalization of intra-Asian trade barriers in the coming decade.
Today, with a population of 1.7 billion and an impressive growth rate that the World Bank calls the highest in the world, South Asia is very much the place to be in.
While maximizing on the opportunities presented by Western economic policies, we also need to learn from our own cultures of Buddhism Hinduism and Islam.
For instance, there is much that secular states can lean from the principles of Islamic Commercial Law - in particular, the notion of fair industrial relations, the notion of fair contract, the notion of commercial integrity, and the notion of freedom from usury.
Sri Lanka has long been acknowledged as having the potential to become a geo-economic centre in the Indian Ocean. With this in mind, we are implementing the next round of macro-economic structural reforms in conjunction with an ambitious programme of infrastructural development.
Firstly, the Kandy-Colombo-Hambantota Corridor. This Corridor consists of a series of major infrastructure developments consisting of the Kandy City Expansion Programme. The North-Western Industrial and Tourism Development Programme will be the dynamo for employment and growth. The Western Megapolis Plan, which is designed to urbanize the entire Western Province, will make it an environmentally conscious, sustainable mega city of the 21st century (with a population of 8.5 million people).
The Southern Tourism Infrastructure Development Programme centering on the historic city of Galle.The Hambantota Economic Development Programme, which will bring industrialization to the Southern territories and enhance its tourist potential. Incidentally Hambantota, in the southern tip of the island, is the historical port to which sampans arrived from the straits of Java and Malaya.
Furthermore, 269 hectares is currently being reclaimed from the sea to become a Financial City. This will provide a base for logistical and financial services in South Asia, and will complement the chain of business hubs from Hong Kong, to Singapore to Dubai.These initiatives will be supported by two international airports in Mattala and Katunayake and two harbours in Colombo and Hambantota. Finally, the Government has also signed an agreement with Surbana Jurong Private Limited to prepare a master plan for the Trincomalee Economic Development Project on the East Coast
Moving on to the trade front - we are currently navigating trade liberalization through a mixture of initiatives. We have undertaken several bilateral trade enhancement initiatives, which will accelerate Sri Lankas access to the worlds major markets.
The Governments of India and Sri Lanka will finalize the Economic Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) by the end of the year.
Finalising a Free Trade Agreement with China in 2017. This will connect us to the One Belt-One Road initiative.
Negotiating a Free Trade Agreement with Singapore, which we plan to conclude very soon.Establishing closer Economic Cooperation with Japan.Expanding the existing trade treaties with our neighbours in South Asia.And we are also looking to explore trade agreements with other Bay of Bengal nations - Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Myanmar, and West Asia.
