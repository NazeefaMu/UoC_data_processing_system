An Act to sell Court productions
	
The Justice Ministry was planning to work out legislation that, if enacted, would provide for selling off Court productions if cases were dragged on for months, Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said yesterday.
The Minister told the Daily Mirror his Ministry was hard pressed to maintain various items such as vehicles, kept as court productions till the authorities concerned dispensed with cases.
Therefore, he said a new piece of legislation would be introduced to sell them off in respect of delayed court cases.
It will generate some revenue. After cases are heard, we will decide on such money to be shared with the parties concerned. If the court production concerned was confiscated, the monies will go to the Government coffers. Otherwise, it will be handed over to the party involved, he said.
The Minister said his Ministry had to obtain lands on lease to keep vehicles and other moveable properties declared as court productions.
It involves a huge cost, he said. (Kelum Bandara)

Anti-SAITM protest march reaches Colombo
	
The five-day protest march launched by the SAITM Virodi Sisu-Jana Vyaaparaya demanding that the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) be abolished, reached Colombo today.
About 4000 protestors participated in the march which started from Kandy on Monday.
Concluding the march in front of the Colombo Fort Railway Station, Medical Student's Action Committee (MSAC) Convener Ryan Jayalath said they would take crucial decisions with regard to the SAITM issue if the government continued with its suppression on anti-SAITM forces.
We are forced to take tough action in the future. Our struggle gets more strong with the suppression of the government. The government is conspiring to legalize SAITM with the Second Phase of the 77s Revolution, he added.
He said that they would continue their struggle until they succeed in their mission and added that trade unions including the doctors were forced to take trade union action due to such steps taken by the government.
Addressing the gathering, Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said that the SAITM should be immediately abolished and there should be no other interim solutions.
The SAITM will be definitely abolished and we will not step back from this struggle against the SAITM until we will reach the final destination, he added.
Meanwhile, Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) Leader Prof. Tissa Vitharana said he was pleased to see the university students, trade unions and peoples attempting to abolish the SAITM.
The government is always attempting to privatize or sell national assets. This could not merely be considered as a struggle against the SAITM, but a struggle to stand against the state policies, he added.
Several trade unions representing health care services, teachers, university lectures and representatives of several political parties were also participated in this protest march. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Ball in JO court, says Musthapha
	
Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Musthapha said he met elections monitoring watchdogs PAFFREL, CaFFE, CMEV and the Transparency International and they consented to conduct Provincial Council elections in a single day departing from the policy adopted by the previous regime to hold PC polls on a scattered basis for political advantage.
Minister Musthapha added that the cabinet approval has been granted to introduce amendments to the Provincial Councils Election Act no. 2 of 1998 enabling elections to all 9 PCs to be conducted on a single day citing the holding of PC polls on a scattered basis was a waste of state public money and the negative effect it has on democracy.
Addressing the SLFP weekly news briefing at the party office yesterday Minister Musthapha said the Parliament would decide on the date on which the PC polls could be conducted once the amendments were passed in a two thirds majority. The Steering Committee on Constitutional Reforms had also agreed to hold PC polls in a single day
The term of office of 9 provinces is scheduled to expire in four stages which is Sabaragamuwa, Eastern and North-Central in September / October period, Central, Wayamba and Northern in October 2018, Central, Southern and Western in April 2019 and Uva in October 2019.
Commenting on the amendments to the Local Government Electoral (Amendments) Act no. 12 of 2012, Minister Musthapha said the amendments had been gazetted and tabled in the Order Book of Parliament. Under the proposed new amendments the ratio of local government members elected under the first past the post system will be reduced to 60% from earlier 70% and the number of representatives chosen under the PR system will be increased to 40% from 30%. The women representation will be 25%.
If party leaders can come to a compromise, amendments can be passed in the next session of Parliament and local government polls can be conducted in three months after that, Minister Musthapha stressed.
Minister Musthapha said his Ministry had completed its task of drafting and gazeting of 56 amendments that delayed the conducting of local government polls and as such party leaders must decide how soon they want to pass the amendments in Parliament paying the way for early local government polls.
I have written to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to expedite the process to pass the amendments as early as possible and also appraised President Maithripala Sirisena on the matter, Minister Muthapha said.
Minister Musthapha lamented that before the submission of the De-limitation committee report and the drafting of the amendments, the joint opposition criticized him and his ministry unfairly for the delay to conduct polls. Now that, the de-limitation report and amendments proposed by it had been gazetted no one is interested in passing the amendments.
Minister Mustapha said the government had no intention to postpone the Local Government election for any reason but to hold the polls as early as possible. Therefore, the government expects the cooperation of all political parties and the joint opposition in particular to pass the amendments paving way for early elections. Pics by Samantha Perera.
Responding to a journalist, Minister Murhapha said the 66th anniversary of the SLFP was scheduled to be celebrated with at massive rally the Campbell Park on September 2nd and appealed all SLFP members of the joint oppositionot to do the mistake done by past SLFPers who betrayed the party and had to repent for their sin later on.
In Sri Lanka, we have only two major parties that can form a government which are the UNP and the SLFP. Many disgruntled senior members of the two parties in the past left the party but perished. Some others came back and took a back seat and another few retired from politics. So I appealed all of the disappointed SLFPers to rethink formingh of new parties and come back to the SLFP if you want to remain in active politics, Minister Musthapha said.

Bravo Bravissimo My Elder Sister   A Wonderful Centenarian
	
A sister is a gift to the heart, a friend to the spirit, a golden thread to the meaning of life. This quote wonderfully describes what my eldest sister Elaine meant to me, when my darling Mummy entered Eternal Glory to be with her Maker. 
My sister Elaine was the eldest with three younger sisters and two younger brothers. She was always a loving and caring sister whom we always looked up to. 
Elaine was educated at Princess of Wales College, Moratuwa. She studied up to the Senior Cambridge and participated in the schools activities. She married Christopher Fernando, who was teaching at a school at Tangalle
I was her youngest brother and being 14 years junior to her, most naturally I enjoyed a special love where much of her loving attention was showered on me. It developed in to an affectionate and strong bond between us. 
When my darling Mummy was stricken with cancer, bedridden for nearly three years, she nursed her along with my other three sisters. My part was to massage her legs and arms, when I returned home after school. 
My darling Mummys death made a vast impact on my fathers curriculum of work as Magister Magistorum and a legend of Royal College, Colombo. My sister Elaine stepped in and quite rightly provided my father with the comfort and solace needed both at school and at home. 
Elaine was educated at Princess of Wales College, Moratuwa. She studied up to the Senior Cambridge and participated in the schools activities. She married Christopher Fernando, who was teaching at a school at Tangalle. He too hailed from Moratuwa and finally came to live with us when he got an appointment to teach at St. Thomas College, Mt. Lavinia. 
Elakka lives with his son and daughter-in-law, and her daughter lives in Canada. She is blessed with five grand children and eight great-grand children. Elakka, my eldest sister has touched the lives of many relations and friends whenever her services were needed because of her altruistic attitude in life. She gave her compassion and kindness to everyone who moved with her. Her inspiration and courage at every moment of their lives. 
It is said that there is no better friend than a sister and she was a friend to me whose memories I will always carry in my heart. 
Elakka continues to focus on Jesus Christ at all times. Lylie

The Joint Opposition yesterday said that they would boycott the special Parliamentary debate scheduled to celebrate Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes 40-years in Parliament.
Joint Opposition MP Udaya Gammanpila speaking at a news briefing said the decision had been made based on two factors.
If there is a special debate to mark Mr. Wickremesinghes 40-year in Parliament, the same should be done for other Parliamentarians as well, he said.
He said that the other reason behind the boycott was that they condemned some actions taken by Mr. Wickremesinghe during his 40-year tenure in Parliament rather than appreciate it. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

LG Polls: Monitoring bodies threaten legal action against Govt.
	
Leading election monitoring bodies and civil organizations in the country, who questioned the Governments decision to rush in the 20th Amendment to the Constitution, threatened to take legal against any move to postpone the Provincial Council polls using the said piece of legislation.
Peoples Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL), Centre for Monitoring Election Violence (CMEV), Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CAFFE), Movement for Free and Fair Elections (MFFE), Transparency International and Mothers and Daughters of Lanka questioned the Governments action to rush in the legislation which was approved by the Cabinet on Wednesday under which the Government was planning to hold elections for all nine Provincial Councils on the same day.
PAFFREL Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi told a media briefing yesterday that poll monitoring bodies and civil movements were always favourable towards holding Provincial Council elections on the same day but what all movements opposed was the intention of the Government.
No one would oppose holding the Provincial Council elections on the same day but the issue is the intention of the government. It is clear that the intention of the Government is to avoid holding elections, he said.
We do have an intention of taking legal action against the postponement of elections, Mr. Hettiarachchi added while saying that election monitoring bodies had already begun discussions with their legal advisors on the matter.
He suggested that the Government could hold elections for all Provincial Councils together by prematurely dissolving the councils whose terms do not lapse in October.
CaFFE Executive Director Keerthi Tennekoon questioned the genuineness of Opposition as well on the matter.
We cannot see the Opposition parties and the Leader of Opposition making a serious effort to force the Government to hold the polls. People should take to the streets and surround Parliament and the local Government Ministry, he said.
CMEV National Coordinator Manjula Gajanayake said the Government should decide on holding Provincial Council Elections on the same day after having a dialogue with the poll monitoring bodies.
Previous regime held elections using the entire State machinery illegally but this regime, which promised to stop such practices, is trying to avoid holding polls by violating a basic democratic principle of holding polls properly, he said.
Centre for Policy Alternatives Executive Director Dr. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu said the present regime should be reminded of the promises it made during elections.
This regime promised to uphold democracy and it should be reminded that these promises should be fulfilled, he said.
The polls monitoring bodies and the civil movements also urged the Government to hold the elections for more than 60 local bodies, which do not have any issues pertaining to delimitation.

Norwegian expert on Uma Oya Project: 'Suitable machinery not used for the project'
	
Norwegian expert Bent Aagaard who inspected the Uma Oya Multipurpose Development Project that had caused many problems in the Bandarawela area has said that the machinery used for the Project had not been capable of proper strengthening of the tunnel wall and to seal them with strong grout materials.
Mr. Aagaard made these remarks in the interim report submitted to President Maithripala Sirisena at the Presidents Official Residence in Colombo today.
Mr. Aagaard said the preliminary studies had not forecast the possibility of large water seepage in the tunnel; Excavation must be done by using suitable machinery on the tunnel wall and grouting all the leaks in the tunnel to ensure that there will be no seepage in the tunnel in the future, he added.
He further said the contractors had not been prepared for large scale water ingress in the tunnel. He advised that it would be necessary to get special grout material and machinery before remaining the four and a half kilometer stretch of the tunnel is dug as a part of it is below the residential areas.
He was of the view that a better comprehensive preliminary study could have prevented the water ingress into the tunnel leading to a severe water dearth in some areas.
Meanwhile, President Sirisena said it was regrettable that a series of problems had arisen during the project as the previous government had hurriedly commenced the project without proper study of the feasibility report and the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).
The President requested the expert to provide a full report on how the leakage could be completely stopped and the reasons for not taking into the consideration the water leakage in the previous reports; The government plans to obtain expert advice prior to implementation of the next project in which a 22 Km long tunnel is to be constructed, he added.

He sought indulgence of the Commission to allow to keep the laptop with his client until his evidence was finished.
He was concerned about the material in the laptop pertaining to the time period since January 27, 2017, to date.
He said there are lawyer-client information and personal data in it and the exposure of such data was contradictory to the professional obligations of a lawyer and it would also hamper their defense.
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda replying said that they were aware about such data and suggested that they need to look into all data and if the material contained lawyer client information that amounting to furtherance of the offence, then it cannot be considered as a professional privileges.
The ASG also undertook not to look into the data relating to lawyer-client relation until Palisenas evidence was over.
However, considering the submissions of the both parties, the Commission directed Palisenas counsel to hand over all devices including the laptop and send a representative to the investigators and make sure the data relating to January 27 to date be deleted in front of them.
The Commission said that the name of the item thus deleted should be given to the investigators so that they could retrieve them after Kasun Palisenas evidence was led.
In the meantime, raising an objection on the extracted details presented on August 2, related to Aloysius mobile phone, Chanaka de Silva who appeared on behalf of Arjuna Mahendran contended the manner in which such details were presented before the Commission.
He was of the view that the experts, who extracted the details should come before the commission and verify the authenticity of the evidence.
He objected to the way in which such phone details were presented suddenly because according to him the details had been extracted on July 25, 2017 and not yet given to them.
The Commission was of the view that the details relating to the Aloysius phone were subject to be proven and if Mr. Aloysius and parties related in those details were to deny them then the Attorney Generals Department had to prove its credibility.
Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera said the authenticity of the details has to be proven and that was why the messages extracted from Aloysius which were related to RK and Ravi K were presented for the Minister the other day.
The ASG said if the Minister had accepted them then the authenticity of the extraction would have been proven. Thereby he said they would prove the credibility of the details in due course.
Counsel Chanaka de Silva yesterday also continued the cross examination of Mr. Jayalath, former Superintendent of the EPF.
Mr. de Silva questioned the witness over the allegations that he leveled against former Governor of CBSL, Arjun Mahendran during the testimony.
During the cross examination the witness said that when the EPF gains profits through engaging more secondary market transactions and then it would do good for its total fund as a whole.
Counsel asked So dont you think the instruction to intensify the secondary market transactions given by former Governor is prudent
He should have given the authority to us to do such trading in the Secondary Market, the witness said.
When the counsel questioned the witness whether the Governor had further instructed him to intensify transactions his answer was negative.
From the cross examination it was also revealed that the decision to get Secondary Market transactions daily by the former Governor from the EPF was not an imprudent decision.
The Commission said that it was well aware of the management tasks and the decision of former Governor to ask such details.
ASG Livera however, said that that decision itself should not be taken into consideration in isolation.
During the cross examination, Counsel Harsha Nananyakkara, who appeared on behalf of Saman Kumara also questioned the witness.
Earlier, the witness had said that interdicted Saman Kumara was a constant visitor to Arjuna Mahendrans office and had communicated secondary market transaction details to him.
During the questions it was revealed that Saman Kumara was an executive of the trade union of CBSL.
The Counsel was the view that his client was visiting Mahendrans office to talk about trade union matters.
But the witness said that he was told by Saman Kumara that he had talked with Mahendran on other matters.
He said from the discussions that he had with Mahendran, it was also evident that he knew things relating to EPF Secondary Market matters, which are known only by dealers like Saman Kumara. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

## Title: Sri Lankas Energy Security Pioneering towards Solar Energy

Sri Lankas Energy Security Pioneering towards Solar Energy
	
During the pre-modern era, Sri Lankan energy requirements for heating, lighting and drying relied on plant based flammable substances. With the arrival of new technology in the mid-19th century, the range of energy sources expanded due to the importation of modern energy sources such as coal and petroleum products, which subsequently replaced the traditional fuels either partly or fully in different sub-sectors. 
The use of Petroleum products for thermal power generation has been significantly increased in past few years. Due to this reason hydroelectricity has decreased from 49% to 35%. This has reduced the capability of the state owned Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), to generate power at a lower cost. Consequently, the burden to the government, electricity intensive industries and the domestic consumers has been affected severely. 
Sri Lankas Current Energy Balance
The price of coal which is considered as low is also going up. In 1990, unit of electricity produced with coal was 18 cents. In 2000, it became 90 cents. In 2010 it was Rs.6.00. In 2011 it has become Rs.10.71. Accordingly, by 2020 it will be around Rs.40  50. As a result even if everyone is supplied by electricity in time, all of us should keep in mind that the era of cheap electricity is over.The probability of price increases of fossil fuels in the future mainly due declining resources and world
environmental concerns. 
Some countries like America, France, Australia, China and even India are planning to power the entire country by solar Energy by 2035
The share of hydro-power is estimated to reduce from 40.2% in 2007 to 19.5% by 2020, while coal-fired thermal generation is estimated to reach 70.9% by 2020. A recent study done by Harvard University reports that the life-cycle effects of coal, and the waste steam generated, is costing every country in billions. 
coal, the most polluting way to generate electricity, is a serious threat to our climate. burning coal is the biggest single source of CO2 emissions from human activity. A study says A typical coal plant with a once-through cooling system withdraws between 70 and 180 billion gallons of water per year. Many researchers have found that coal manufacturing is one of the main reasons to global warming. global warming is a crucial fact. There is a high tendency of banning coal manufacturing in the world. Most of the countries are working for it already.What will happen to us if coal manufacturing is eliminated entirely in next 5 years There wont be any use of those coal power stations. As we all know past few governments had invested billions on those coal power stations. Even after multiple breakdowns in our coal power stations the government still wasting millions for no reason. Are we in a position to bear the extra cost to generate electricityAre we in a position to find a solution for this coal ban 
leaning towards Coal as a long-term solution
Energy demand in Sri Lanka is mainly dependant on hydro-power so that electricity supply decreases severely when the country is hit by serious droughts. This has led to a dramatic decline in economic growth. As we can remember, serious droughts in 1996 meant that Sri Lanka experienced a severe power crisis which adversely affected the Economy in 1996. According to a recent study Sri Lankas rainfall will decrease by 35% in 2030. So the struggle is real. We cant even fulfill the demand with enough of current rainfall. So what would happen if we lose it  Not only that, it is predicted that islands population will reach 25 mn in 2030. If we do not do something on this matter our countrys economy is at stake for sure. 
There is a high tendency of 2 hour power cuts during peak time in next few months
To achieve this Energy Crisis
 Increase budget allocations for Research and Development (R&D) in renewable energy sources. It is well known our governments budget allocation for R&D is less than 1%, while most of the developed countries allocate more than 10% on researches. Investing more on solar power is the world trend now. Some countries like America, France, Australia, China and even India are planning to power the entire country by solar energy by 2035. Developing economies almost matched developed economies in solar energy investments. So the role of solar energy in a country is becoming a vital fact in countrys economy. But we are still. 
 Education and training in energy saving technique programs should start from school level. Energy security has to be a discipline in this country.
 Financial institutes should encourage their customers by providing easy repayment terms for solar panels and should fund more on solar energy projects.
Recently I got a chance to visit a newly built boutique hotel in Negombo. Since it is a multi-million project I asked the owner whether he is willing to install solar panels in his building. He said that he needs to understand the energy consumption pattern over a period of time and then decide to go with solar panels or not. Spending more money on renewables seems to be a waste for many Sri Lankans. Changing this attitude and encourage people to use solar energy is essential. 
Most of the construction projects are multi-million projects. So spending more on solar panels wont be a crucial fact. I would like to suggest, based on the Value of the building, Function and the energy consumption, as a percentage generating electricity from solar panels is compulsory. In Sri Lanka, as per my knowledge we still use traditional solar panels which are very costly. solar technology is rapidly developing nowadays. Solar battery has become portable sized these days, which has a capacity of 15kWh for daily cycle applications. Recently a team of researchers developed a wall paint that can generate energy. So it is understood the world is moving fast with clean energy. We need more investors to acquire these technologies. 
The most recent situation
As per the Minister of Power and Renewable Energy, he stated that there is a high tendency of 2 hour power cuts during peak time in next few months. He also stated that we have only 36.4% water remain in reservoirs to generate electricity. As per the ministry, to distribute consistent power, the government has to spend at least LKR 50 billion. Not surprisingly that also for a lasting solution. So the struggle is real. 
Therefore, leaning towards solar Energy as a long term solution has to be
initiated immediately.

Swimming doyenne Tara Bolling passes away
	
Tara Bolling, a name synonymous with Sri Lankan swimming after having carved out an illustrious career as a renowned swimmer and national coach, passed away yesterday.
During her time in the pool in the 50s and 60s, Bolling shone at both local and foreign meets and is frequently touted as one of the countrys great female swimmers. Her most stellar international outing came at the 1958 Tokyo Asian Games, where she finished fourth in the 400 metres freestyle event.
However, later generations of swimmers are more likely to remember Bolling for her coaching prowess and significant contribution to the sports local growth. In 1988 Tara, together with her late husband Ralph and son David, founded Rainbow Aquatics Sri Lanka. The club would go on to produce a steady stream of national talent and continues to develop distinguished swimmers who have notched up a clutch of record-breaking performances both within and beyond Sri Lanka. Bolling also served as the countrys national coach at the 1987 and 1989 South Asian Games, while further functioning as a national assistant coach at the 1991 South Asian Games and 1988 Olympic Games.
Tara is also the mother of renowned national swimmer Julian Bolling, who after a celebrated swimming career which saw him win 15 gold medals at the South Asian Games and represent Sri Lanka at three Olympic Games, would follow in his mothers coaching footsteps by taking over the reins at Rainbow Aquatics.

## Title: The government  weighs its options

The government  weighs its options
	
All in all, the government won last week. The petrol strikers were put down after briefly flirting with uncertainty: we didnt know what the officials would do, and frankly we were worried they wouldnt do anything. By resolving their issue without resorting to brute force (for the first time, our president made significant use of those extraordinary powers vested in him by declaring the distribution of fuel an essential service), the bad guys were demarcated as the strikers. Not the government. This was and is true also for the University students: we have grown so used to their rhetoric over SAITM that we are merely tired whenever they demand action on the streets.
The truth is that weve been selling ourselves for the past 60 years. The truth is that this government is no different to its predecessors.
	Everything that the previous government had a hand in shaping, including SAITM and the sell-out to China and Wilpattu, was effectively turned into campaigns against the President and the Prime Minister.
	Most of these protesters have actually subverted their own aims. Fuel has come to be something of a necessity to the entire country,
	Constitutional amendments are to this government what protests against them are to the Joint Opposition.
	The fuel strike wasnt totally unsuccessful, as I pointed out earlier. But it did teach us some lessons. Pertinent, timeless lessons. Predominantly in the political sphere. We can choose to heed them, or we can choose to ignore. Either way, weve lost.
Sri Lanka to sign Port Deal with China! screams the headlines from the New York Times, The Guardian, and The Economic Times. The petrol strike was a corollary to what was perceived as the governments sell-out of strategic assets to foreign entities, which proved so controversial, in fact, that while the strike was ongoing we ended up revising the terms of the agreement with China (regarding the Hambantota Port) from an 80:20 share distribution to a 69.55:30.45, divided between China Merchants Port and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority. So the strike wasnt totally unsuccessfully: we brought up our share of the lease by 10.45 percentage points. 
Notwithstanding the way they inconvenienced the public, and any future action they may take to inconvenience us even further, I personally think they were trying to make an important point. You may argue (as Rajitha Senaratne did at a press conference) that Mahinda Rajapaksa is behind these strikes, that he is financing them with the money he looted from the public coffers (or the deals he struck to build those roads even those who hate him admire), but the truth is that when a set of impoverished, hard-done-by state workers resort to the streets despite the threat of dismissal, they deserve more than a passing glance. Nobody has spoken for them. The truth is that nobody wants to. As I noted in my column last week, we are so shrouded in ambivalence that even those who strike in our countrys name are laid aside. 
The truth is that weve been selling ourselves for the past 60 years. The truth is that this government is no different to its predecessors. But the protesters arent bemoaning that. They should be, but they arent. They are not shouting about the process, but about those who are heading that process. In that sense, these protests are politically motivated. And in that sense, those who chose to remain silent when the previous regime capitulated with the SAITM issue are being selective now. 
Forget this though. In politics theres something called the opportune moment. Protest campaigns and feel-good slogans are based on that moment. Everything that the previous government had a hand in shaping, including SAITM and the sell-out to China and Wilpattu, was effectively turned into campaigns against the President and the Prime Minister. For the record, they have not been unsuccessful there. Those who have through articles or speeches compelled the state to take a firmer hand against the protesters are, by that logic, caving into what the Joint Opposition wants them to do: diminish their own legitimacy by doing more of what they did in their time. 
Given this its no surprise that the government is weighing its options. Trade Unions arent elected representatives: they are selected, sometimes by secret ballot, and they cant speak for the people. The State knows this, which is why it claims that pressure groups cant override what the people want. But what do the people want Roughly the same thing the State wants! Its friends are ours, its enemies are ours. The Bills it enacts, the legislation it crystallises and later amends, are all ours. It would be subverting the very basis of democracy if we were to let Trade Unions dictate to the State. And to a considerable extent, we would be inclined to agree. 
These protests are not achieving what they set out to do, not surprisingly. The stark truth is that whatever the protest may be, unless were in a totalitarian Orwellian dictatorship, all their arguments, regardless of how cogent they may be, can be trivialised with the simple counterargument But you dont represent the people! Unless you count a particularly unique political predicament (think of Chandrika Kumaratungas clumsy handling of the war and the subsequent shift of power in and outside parliament to the Jathika Hela Urumaya, regardless of their numbers), an outside pressure group cannot and will not be allowed to influence State policy. 
Trade Unions arent elected representatives: they are selected, sometimes by secret ballot, and they cant speak for the people. The State knows this, which is why it claims that pressure groups cant override what the people want. But what do the people want Roughly the same thing the State wants!
And thats not all. Most of these protesters have actually subverted their own aims. Fuel has come to be something of a necessity to the entire country, as have doctors and engineers and bus drivers, but these have a considerable impact on the poor. The middle classes will be squeezed beyond endurance when petrol stations run out of petrol, but when doctors vacate their hospitals their absence will be felt mostly by the not-so-affluent, i.e. those who cant afford to visit a private hospital. The governments enemy is not the peoples enemy, certainly not all the time. But when you have doctors out of hospitals and when the generator that fuelled up the garment factory you earned your daily stipend from runs out of diesel, you do tend to worry more about your economic plight. We are selfish, yes. But so is everyone else.
When a prominent yahapalanist Marxist and apologist (yes, they are both, sometimes at the same time) contended some months back that the government must address grievances through constitutional amendments and affirmative legislative enactments, I fired back contending that the ordinary Sinhalese, Tamil, Muslim, Burgher, and whatever-else man, woman, and child on the street will not bother about them without first thinking of his or her daily bread. Constitutional amendments are all fine and well, but without the necessary economic backdrop to them, they will run out of fuel. Now it would be hypocritical of me to suggest that this doesnt hold valid for the other side: i.e. the nationalist, anti-federalist, and anti-yahapalana side. 
In the end, these protests will only deepen political rifts. Those who support the government, while not exactly salivating over it, will see Rajapaksa and his cohorts behind the protesters
Constitutional amendments are to this government what protests against them are to the Joint Opposition. In both cases, what is ignored is the simple fact that the people will not be placated by political slogans if their economic needs arent met. When it comes to the middle class especially (because the middle class has become more politically empowered), no amount of feel-good rhetoric about the future of the country will move them. This means, whether we like it or not, that no amount of fuel strikes and power cuts will awaken the nationalist in us until and unless we can be sure that the economic prerequisites to being a nationalist are fulfilled. 
In the end these protests will only deepen political rifts. Those who support the government, while not exactly salivating over it, will see Rajapaksa and his cohorts behind the protesters. Those who support the Rajapaksa Cabal, and especially those fiercely attached to it, will lambast the government whenever the CEB decides to cut power. We dont need that, clearly. We need a pressure group movement thats better organised, not prone to frequent strikes, and whore genuinely concerned about this countrys plight without ignoring its need for an economic backdrop.
Regrettable, but thats the way it is. In the eighties the conventional wisdom was that the economy was more important than the country, which explains why an entire generation grew up hating the arts, ignoring our history, and rubbishing our heritage
And why Because that backdrop is what conditions us. Regrettable, but thats the way it is. In the eighties the conventional wisdom was that the economy was more important than the country, which explains why an entire generation grew up hating the arts, ignoring our history, and rubbishing our heritage. Culture can be salvaged only by selling it! was what our leaders propagated around town, and we swallowed the pill they gave us. We are still paying for those sins, but until we stop paying, and until we let go of that inferiority complex and colonial hangover we suffer from even today, the truth is that we will continue to be ruffled, troubled, and altered by economics. When that petrol station runs out of fuel, when food shortages and power cuts are the order of the day, and when the generator at your office shuts down and with it your office too, we will eventually bother less about the country. 
The fuel strike wasnt totally unsuccessful, as I pointed out earlier. But it did teach us some lessons. Pertinent, timeless lessons. Predominantly in the political sphere. We can choose to heed them, or we can choose to ignore. Either way, weve lost.

Why is only my father blamed : Onella
	
Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake's daughter Onella has made an impassioned plea on her Facebook page asking why it was only her father to blame in such a huge Government.
Just ask yourself Why only one mans name comes up all the time in such a huge government she asked, making comparison to her father's testimony.
Minister Karunanayake while testifying at the Bond Commission also asked the same question from the Attorney General when questioned about the undated and un-referenced letter sent under his signature.
Why am I the only one to blame There was collective responsibility, he said.
Below is Onella's full Facebook post:
"Am not at all a person who uses social media to express views or thoughts in lengthy status messages but i fell that sadly today it has come to a point where i feel i at least have to voice out my thoughts on the same platforms that my family is getting character assassinated on.
I have seen many articles circulated all around social media about my father for a very long time but for the first time i feel i need to intervene and speak out cause this particular time it is a malicious constant attack on his character that is orchestrated by others who aim to achieve other things trying to make my father a fall man.
I see everyone very easily resharing content on many pages on social media but all have only one name. My fathers name. Does everyone really believe for the last couple years everything in the government is just one man and that we have been getting hit cause we deserve it or that maybe there is a pattern to this madness now
I know that when situations arise we all want to get to the bottom of things and find someone responsible for it but are u sure that all the sites carry facts or have you ever though that this could be well planned and paid attempts from others in politics who would need to cover up there sins by directing all negative attention to one man
Everyone is entitled to freedom of speech but with freedom of speech also comes the responsibility to know all the true facts and figures and not only the damaging views that are paid to catch on to all.
I cannot change everyones opinions about how you see my family but i respectfully just ask you to think before you fall prey to these well paid character assassins targeting just one man constantly.
I have learnt bitterly over the years that politics is a dirty game and some in it will stop at nothing to achieve the individual goals no matter who they hurt along the way.
So if you have actually taken time to read through this fully all i want to ask you at the end is please think. Thinking can one man do everything all the time Can one man always be doing these things jus to get negative publicity or is he actually being framed and made to be the fall man again and again
Please all i ask you is to think before u form a one sided opinion cause again like i have learnt the hard ways politics is not how it appears to be. Think if u have all the facts cause i know that you will be surprised if u really sit to think whats going on.
Just ask yourself Why only one mans name comes up all the time in such a huge government
Again everyone is free to think how they see it from the facts they have but i have now given you a small view from my family's side. So please just open your eyes and think a little because in this instance its not any commission but the media and the public that has been the judge, jury and executioner.
Like my father said after visiting the commission that day and coming out:
"I can accept the spearing of an enemy's arrow but the pin pricking of friends is much more hurtful," she said.
