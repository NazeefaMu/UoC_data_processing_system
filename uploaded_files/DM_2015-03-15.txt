34 dead after ferry capsizes off Myanmar
	
At least 34 people are dead after a ferry capsized off the Southeast Asia nation of Myanmar, the country's state-run daily said Saturday, citing a police source.
The state-owned passenger ferry Aung Ta Gon-3 had 214 passengers and crew on board, according to the Global New Light of Myanmar.
Myanmar's Ministry of Information said in a statement that the ship capsized Friday night as it sailed, in bad weather conditions, around the city of Sittwe. A large wave crashed into the ferry, causing it capsize near Myaybone and Myaukkyine islands.
The newspaper reported that 31 women and three men died. Authorities have managed to rescue at least 167 people, according to the information ministry for Myanmar, which is also known as Burma.
Pictures from the government showed rescue workers helping people off a boat onto the land.
Sittwe is the capital of Rakhine state and sits on the Bay of Bengal, about 55 miles (90 kilometers) from the Bangladesh border. This weekend's weather forecast for the city calls for some clouds giving way to clear skies, with high daytime temperatures expected to be in the 30s Celsius (80s to 90s Fahrenheit).
Fatal ferry disasters are nothing new to the region.
Last month, at least 68 people died when a packed double-decker ferry sank while on the Padma River north of neighboring Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka, officials said. A cargo vessel hit the ferry, causing it to overturn and trapping passengers on its lower deck.
Forty-five people died in an accident on the same river in August.
In May 2013, several boats carrying as many as 150 people were thought to have capsized near Myanmar's western coast ahead of a storm approaching the area.
Those boats were carrying Rohingya, members of Myanmar's long-suffering Muslim minority, Thailand-based U.N. official Kirsten Mildren said at the time now.(CNN)

Draft Bill on constitutional reforms to be gazetted
	
The Cabinet today decided to gazette the draft bill providing for constitutional reforms, political sources said. 
The decision was taken after a meeting chaired by President Maitripala Sirisena. It is learnt the draft bill includes clauses for the re-instatement of the 17th Amendment and the transfer of executive powers to Parliament and the Cabinet.
According to the 100-day programme of the Government, the constitutional amendments have to be enacted by March 23. 
However, there has been no agreement on the electoral reforms and some other matters and as such the Cabinet has decided to have separate meetings with other party leaders on these matters before incorporating them later as separate pieces of legislations.
The political parties had extensive discussions on the proposed constitutional reforms and the proposed bill, if enacted, will remove the presidential powers to dissolve Parliament after one year, to appoint Ministry Secretaries while continuing to function as the Minister of Defence.(Kelum Bandara)

More evidence emerges of ISIS using chemical weapons
	
There is evidence to prove that ISIS is using chlorine gas as a chemical weapon in its battle against peshmerga forces in Iraq, Kurdish authorities have claimed.
It says peshmerga forces discovered '20 gas canisters' loaded on the back of a truck involved in a suicide bomb attack in Iraq on January 23.
The Kurdistan Region Security Council says the chemical attack took place on a road between Iraq's second largest city of Mosul and the Syrian border.
It was here that peshmerga fighters were desperately trying to seize the vital supply line used by the militants when they found the alleged weapons.
A Kurdish official said dozens of peshmerga fighters were treated for 'dizziness, nausea, vomiting and general weakness' after the attack.
Traces of chlorine were discovered after samples of clothing and soil from the site were analysed, the Kurds claim. (DAILY MAIL)

Video: Now Lotus Tower in hot water
	
The Lotus Tower or Nelum Kuluna will turn out to become the next hot topic with regard to projects initiated by the previous government with Ports, Shipping and Aviation Minister Arjuna Ranatunga vowing to discuss the project with the President and the Prime Minister. 
While on a visit to the Port City Project, the Minister said the tower was being constructed on land owned by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) and that there were no documents to prove that land had been acquired for the project. 
The former SLPA chairman and the then subject minister should be responsible for this discrepancy. This is not just anybodys land. It is SLPA land and there is a procedure that must be followed, the minister said.
He said the land belonging to the SLPA had been provided under the guise of carrying out a development project but there were no development projects being conducted on this land.
We will ensure that lands belonging to the SLPA will remain with the Authority and the income generated through projects on these lands or by the SLPA will be for the Authority, he said. (Indika Sri Aravinda )WATCH

Video: Vigneswaran hits out at Ranil
	
	After Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Jaffna, the Chief Minister of Tamil-majority region in Sri Lanka hit out at Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe for his controversial comments on shooting trespassing Indian fishermen.
	Talking exclusively to CNN-IBN CV Vigneswaran said, "That is not the way for a head of government to say to a friendly country. As far as the fishermen are concerned, all deep sea trawlers must be sent to Bay of Bengal or the Arabian Sea."
	"The solution is to prohibit trawlers in the Palk Strait Area and have a Palk Strait management committee and they should be in a position to see that none of these things are happening and that they go to deep sea," Vigneswaran added.
	Wickramasinghe had alleged that Indian fishermen were taking away the livelihood of Northern Lanka fishermen. "If someone tries to break into my house, I can shoot. If he gets killed, law allows me to do that," he said.
	As many as 86 Indian fishermen were arrested and their 10 fishing boats seized by the Sri Lanka Navy for allegedly poaching in the country's waters in February.
	Modi on Saturday night returned home after wrapping up his five-day three- nation tour.
	During his Sri Lanka visit, the first by an Indian PM in almost 28 years, Modi reached out to the country, saying the security of the two nations is "indivisible" and favoured a life of equality, justice and dignity for Tamils in its "new journey" of peace and reconciliation.
	He also addressed the Sri Lankan Parliament and held talks with top Lankan leadership, including President Maithripala Sirisena, during his visit.
