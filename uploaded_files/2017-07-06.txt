Bad equipment cause of Uma Oya fissures: Samarasinghe
	
The cause for the cracks in the Bandarawela area was the use of the low quality excavation equipment in the Uma Oya Project, SLFP organiser and Vocational Training and Skills Development Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said today.
Responding a question at a news briefing held at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Head Quarters he said foreign experts who advised on the project had expressed that the cracks had been created due to use of low-quality and unsuitable equipment.
?The low-quality excavation equipment had cause more vibrations than the ground could sustain and that had resulted in the fissures and cracks in the houses in the area,? he said.
President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minster Ranil Wickremesinghe had decided to appoint a Select Committee in Parliament to investigate the issues.
?After appointing the Select Committee, they can use Parliamentary Privileges to call the persons who were responsible for the project. From that we would be able to produce a report to Parliament that people could know,? Samarasinghe said.
?In fact people should be made aware of what happened during the project. The Government had spent a huge sum and it cannot be stopped but we have to fix the issue by using suitable technology,? he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

## Title: DEHIWELA ZOO MORE STRESS ON ANIMALS?

DEHIWELA ZOO MORE STRESS ON ANIMALS?
	
Zoo authorities say only aquarium and nocturnal animal section open after 7 p.m.
?
In a bid to provide visitors to the National Zoological Gardens in Dehiwala more time a decision was taken to extend its visiting hours, Wildlife Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera recently said.
Accordingly, the zoo will be open to the public from 7.00 a.m. to 10.00 p.m. from September, while additional attractions will be established at the premises.
While attending the 81 Anniversary of the National Zoological Gardens, Dehiwela recently the Minister revealed the details about the programme. He said a part of the zoo would be renovated under the new operation and the programme would be initiated in a manner that would not harass the animals.
He also said that under the initiative people would receive the opportunity to watch nocturnal animals and observe their behaviors. He also said the space would be renovated to look like the natural environment where the animals could roam freely.
The Daily Mirror spoke to Animal Rights activists and officials at the zoo regarding the decision.?
Excerpts.
?
?
Director General (Ms.) Dammika Malsinghe, Department of National Zoological Gardens?
We have initiated a new programme to attract the tourists, who visit our country.?
This programme came to light due to the lack of entertainment activities for tourists after dark. Through this concept we hope to generate an additional income to the Zoo.
We were affected by the recent floods but we are functioning as usual now.
According to the new plan the zoo will function under two separate schedules. The zoo will be open as usual from 8.30 a.m. to 6 p.m. and after a closure of one hour the Aquarium and nocturnal animal sections would be open for visitors from 7.00 p.m. to 10.00 p.m.
Under the programme separate paths have been selected for visitors to use and selected areas have been isolated and closed off from the areas occupied by some animals Ms. Malsinghe said.
She said the new timing would be a great opportunity for animal lovers, environmentalists and, zoologists to observe the night life of the animals.
Meanwhile, she assured the programme would be initiated in a manner that would not disturb other animals in other parts of the zoo and would ensure that their comfort would be the first priority.
?The programme was introduced by the Sustainable Development and Wildlife Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera and we believe it will be successful,? she said.?
She said the value of such a move was identified a year ago and it was sure to bring in more tourists.

Otara Gunewardene, Animal Rights Activist
It should never be just so that the visitors can have more time to see the animals, but is it right for the animals? Night time is when they rest and they suffer enough in these cramped and terrible caged conditions that they live in already. Their welfare should be priority, and then comes people and then profit.
Wild animals in captivity must be given a life as close to the one they have in the wild. Teaching our children and adults anything else is what has brought immense suffering to so many for our entertainment.
She also said the Minister and the committee should reveal more details on the plan to the public. She also said the animals could be distressed due to the new programme and that authorities should prevent such incidents.
?
Lalani Perera, Attorney and Animal Rights Activist
In this country, animal abuse for commercial gain is on the increase. Extending the visiting hours at the Dehiwala Zoo up to 10.00 p.m. is adding to this. It is reported that the reason is to give visitors more time to spend at the zoo. Is this an evidence based decision or a ruse to enhance the fast depleting State coffers?
While several countries are closing down their zoos for the sake of the welfare of the animals, this country appears to be adding to their sad plight.?
As animal behaviourists observe zoo animals undergo severe stress, living away from their natural habitats, with visitors gawking, teasing and engaging in noisy revelry, thereby disturbing these animal during day time, seven days a week.?
Close proximity to humans, exposure to noise and artificial lighting have been identified as some causes for this stress, which leads to stereotypical behavior, affecting their mental well being. This is in addition to the immense physical suffering the animals undergo due to confinement in captivity.
If zoos were to be continued with in this maner, they should take the form of sanctuaries, not commercial enterprises.
A group of us has through a case filed in the Court of Appeal, submitted comprehensive recommendations to the zoo authorities to enhance the welfare of zoo animals? one recommendation is that the Dehiwala zoo should be closed to visitors at least once a week and that no night visits should be allowed. But the progress of the recommendations has been woefully slow.
It is very sad that the Minister is also planning to add more attractions. We hope this does not include more performances by animals, especially elephants, to entertain visitors, as the training methods for performances are extremely cruel.
?
Jagath Gunawardana,
Lawyer, Environmentalist
I have seen the proposal and I don?t think it?s a bad move if it is adopted according to the approved standards. These nocturnal animals should have a special enclosure with night lighting. It is also important to not allow the visitors to take photographs with flashlights. The visitors should also be prevented from making loud noises which would trouble the animals.
If the correct protocols are followed I?m sure the animals will act normal regardless of the people?s presence. Though these kind of programme are new to Sri Lanka the world has already adopted it in their Zoological Gardens. Therefore I do not think we should cause any unnecessary panic about it.
?
?
The Daily Mirror also found an introduction to the National Zoological Gardens. It is as follows:
The National Zoological Gardens, Dehiwela ? more commonly called Colombo Zoo ? has a long history. In the early years of the 20th century, John Hagenbeck, brother of the famous animal trainer, Carl Hagenbeck had established the Ceylon Zoological Gardens as a company at Dehiwala.
Initially the Zoo came under the purview of the Government Agent of Colombo and was headed by a Superintendent. When it was made an autonomous department in 1946, the main aim was to satisfy people?s curiosity and thus the Zoo was more focused on entertainment rather than conservation.
Type of exhibits and many other associated features have taken into account for animal enclosures with the changes of new zoo concept the existing techniques. Numbers of species in exhibits were scaled down and many animals were given significant spaces in order to facilitate their natural behaviour.

The Supreme Court allowed the GMOA to intervene during the Supreme Court inquiry into the appeal filed by the Sri Lanka Medical Council today.
The application was supported on Wednesday before Supreme Court Judges Buwaneika Aluvihare, Sisira De Abrew and Anil Gunaratne by President's Counsel Gamini Marapone appearing with Navin Marapana and Ravindranath Dabare on behalf of the the Government Medical Officers Association
The GMOA had earlier sought the Supreme Court?s permission to intervene into the Appeal filed by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) contending the judgment of Court of Appeal.
The Court of Appeal ruled following a trial that the petitioner in that case a SAITM University student who had graduated in MBBS was entitled to register as an MBBS qualified medical practitioner in terms of Section 29(2) of the Medical Ordinance.
The GMOA and several medical students challenging the Appeal Court order sought the SC?s permission to intervene into the appeal.
The SLMC sought an order to set aside the judgment dated January 31, 2017 by Court of Appeal and an interim order to stay the functioning the judgment made by the Court of Appeal in the writ application.
The Court of Appeal after inquiring a writ petition filed by a student of SAITM on January 31 ruled that she SAITM was empowered to grant MBBS degrees. (Farook Thajudeen)

Govt. unhappy over FCID investigations
	
President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the ministers have expressed disappointment over the slow progress of the investigations and the action taken against suspects by the FCID, Cabinet spokesman and Minister, Rajitha Senaratne said yesterday.
He said the Cabinet had called for a report on the FCID and would decide on its fate next week.
The minister told reporters at the weekly cabinet news briefing that the President while expressing his disapproval on the FCID activities had said if the FCID was brought under his purview, he would within six months expose all major cases of fraud, corruption and killings which had taken place during the Rajapaksa regime and prosecute the culprits.
?The Cabinet discussed the FCID?s poor performance as only a few sprats had been brought before the law by investigative division which was appointed with the specific objective of nabbing all criminals whether big or small who were very powerful under the Rajapaksa regime. Even the Prime Minister while maintaining that the FCID was not his creation told ministers that he also was not satisfied with the work being carried out by the FCID,? he said.
The minister said the FCID had failed miserably to nab big-time criminals who had engaged in major financial crimes, killing and embezzlement when the Rajapaksas were in power.
He said the government spends Rs.1.2 million monthly to maintain the FCID. Much publicized investigations had been carried out against Minister A.H.M. Fowzi using a car belonging to another ministry and appointment given to his daughter by former state minister Priyankara Jayaratne.
?The big sharks like Gamini Senarth are still at large. The investigations on the killing of ruggerite Wazim Thajudeen is not satisfying. Pilfering of millions of dollars of state revenue and dumping them in foreign banks and the withdrawal of billions of rupees on election day in January 2015 have still not been unmasked," the minister said.

Lankan accused of murdering wife in Canada deported after charge stayed
	
A Sri Lankan man accused of killing his wife in Quebec, Canada five years ago?has been deported after the charge against him was stayed because of an unreasonable delay, Canadian media reported.
Sivaloganathan Thanabalasingham, a 32-year-old permanent Canadian resident,?was set to appear today at a detention review hearing, but it has been cancelled, a spokesperson at the?Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada said Thursday.
Thanabalasingham's second-degree murder charge was stayed in April after Superior Court Justice Alexandre Boucher ruled it had taken too long to get to trial.
Thanabalasingham?was the first Quebecer charged with murder to have his case stayed because of the Jordan ruling,?a Supreme Court decision issued last?July which imposes strict limits on the waiting time for trials.
He was ordered deported?in April because of an earlier?conviction on domestic abuse charges involving his wife,?Anuja Baskaran.
The assaults predated Baskaran's killing at the apartment she shared with her husband in August 2012.?Thanabalasingham was charged with second-degree murder but pleaded not guilty
Thanabalasingham, who came to Canada as a refugee,?initially appealed the deportation order, but a month later asked to be returned to Sri Lanka as soon as possible.
Quebec's Director of Penal and Criminal Prosecutions (DCPC)?appealed the stay of?the murder charge and, last week, Appeal Court Justice Nicole Duval-Hesler?agreed to expedite the case and?hear?arguments in September.
Jean-Pascal Boucher, a spokesperson for the DCPC, said Thursday the prosecution plans to continue with the appeal process even though Thanabalasingham?has left the country. Canada does not have an extradition agreement with Sri Lanka.
If the appeal is granted, Boucher?said the DCPC would work with the federal Justice Ministry "to?see what we could do."
"For now, it's too soon because we have to respect the Court of Appeal, we have to respect the authority of court, we will do what we have to do in the appeal that is pending right now, and we will see what is happening with the decision at the end," he said.
Judith Gadbois-St-Cyr, a spokesperson for Canada Border Services Agency, declined to comment directly on the case, citing privacy legislation.
She added, however, that the CBSA is legally bound to enforce?removal orders.
The office of federal Immigration?Immigration Minister Ahmed?Hussen, who could have stepped in to block?Thanabalasingham's?deportation,?did not immediately return a request for comment. (CBC)

Monica De Alwis, A most precious Mother
	
A tribute to a very dearly loved and a most precious Mother whom I will ?never ever forget ?
Mrs. Monica Marion Phyllis de Alwis was 96-years-old when she was called to rest with the Lord on 6th April 2017. ?
She was born in Kurunegala on the 01st April 1921 to illustrious parents from a well respected conservative catholic background. ?
She was a daughter of late Chevaliar C.L.W.Perera, a papal knight, J.P.U.M. and Proctor S.C., the doyen of the criminal bar in Kurunegala for decades and of late Esther Perera of ? Esterlyn? Kurunegala. ?
She was the third daughter in a family of 12 children comprising eight daughters and four sons. She along with her other sisters studied at Holy Family Convent, Kurunegala when the school was managed by European Nuns. This gave her a sound education and a good command of the English Language. ?
In 1944 at the age of 23 years she married Lucian de Alwis from the ?Alwis Wallawwa? of Karagampitiya, Dehiwala who was a lawyer and a member of the then Judiciary. ?
After her marriage she came to reside at her husband?s home in Dehiwala. At the time of her death, this year, she was a resident of Dehiwala for 73 long years. She was affectionately called the ?Grand Old lady? of Dehiwala by the long time residents of the area who loved and respected her. ?
She brought forth eleven children comprising six daughters and five sons. Along with Thaththa, Amma brought up the children with love, care, kindness and understanding.. ??
Two of her sons were doctors, the eldest of whom looked after Amma?s health to the very end of her life. The other sons are professionals presently domiciled in Australia. ?
She hardly had any servants to look after the eleven children or assist in the household work. But with courage, determination and with her prayers and God?s providence she turned herself into a courageous Lady. She met all challenges and went on to look after and provide a comfortable home to Thatha and all her children. ?
Amma was extremely generous like her late father and supported the poor who came to her for help. She contributed lavishly to the orphanages, elder?s homes, seminaries and the needy parishes. ?
Amma along with Thatha believed that the family that prays together, stays together. Every evening Amma along with Thatha led the family rosary with all the children. ?
Amma and Thatha shared 55 years of happy married life until Thatha passed away in 1999 at the age of 88. By this time all their children were happily married and were parents themselves. ?
Amma was a simple and a devoted religious lady throughout her life. She was a perfect example of motherhood. She had the divine grace to be a perfect wife and a mother and we were blessed to have had a mother like Amma. ?
After the death of Thaththa, Amma moved to her daughter?s and son-in law?s home close by, which she made her home for the rest of her life. Here Amma lived happily for the last 17 years where she was looked after with love and care by them till she was called to rest with the Lord. ?
She spent these 17 years on earth, in silent prayer, awaiting the call from her creator for a happy and a peaceful death which the Lord granted her on 6th April 2017, quite suddenly and unexpectedly. ?
The hours and days Amma spent in prayer were sufficient not only for her salvation, but for the salvation of all her children, who stood by her, loved and cared for her when she most needed their love and care. That?s ?how she spent her last days on earth. ?
Even in the evening of her life, Amma?s greatest happiness was to see all her children and their families gather together in her house on occasions like her birthday, Christmas, Easter and other family occasions. Her 96th birthday on 01st April this year was one such occasion which was attended by many children and their families who all joined in singing ?Happy Birthday dearest Amma? little knowing that it was Amma?s last birthday on earth. Five days later she was called to rest with the Lord.?
She left behind eleven children, their spouses, twenty five grand children and fourteen great grand children. ? The large crowds from all walks of life who paid their last respects to her mortal remains at her residence and attended her burial at the family grave placed where Thaththa rests, bear ample testimony for the love and respect they all had for our beloved Amma. As we stand beside your grave, we think of you dearest Amma with tearful eyes and silent prayers. ?
?
A requiem Mass will be offered for the repose of her soul at St. Mary?s Church, Dehiwala, at 10.00 a.m. on July 8, 2017 (Poya Day). Your presence and prayers are kindly solicited .
?
?
Within your grave we see your ever smiling face, the look of love and kindness which you showed us as a loving Mother till you closed your eyes. ?From deep within your grave, we hear your voice, the voice we loved to hear so much telling us ?dear children, I am safely home resting in the arms of the Lord whom I loved, trusted and served all my life?. ?
Rest in God?s eternal care, till we meet again on our heavenly home where we will never again have to say ?Good Bye? to you Amma. ?
Continue to guide us Amma with your love and care from heaven above as you did during your life on earth. ?
?
MAY GOD, THE ALMIGHTY FATHER GRANT YOU?ETERNAL REST ?

New Constitution: Let's comment after seeing final draft: Rajitha
	
Cabinet Spokesman and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said yesterday the yahapalana government had been given a mandate by 6.2 million voters to introduce a new Constitution and that the final Constitutional draft had to be studied before making any comments on it.
He told the weekly cabinet news briefing that there was no reason to look at other options in place of a new Constitution amid the statement issued by the Thrinikaika Sangha Sabhava saying that a new 'Constitution was not the need of the hour' taking center stage at the weekly cabinet news briefing.
Ministers Senaratne and Dayasiri Jayasekara responded when journalists asked about the government?s stance on this statement.
Journalist: The Mahasangha have requested the government not to introduce a new Constitution and if necessary bring electoral reforms. What is the government?s stance on this matter?
Minister Senaratane: This government has a mandate from 6.2 million voters to introduce a new Constitution.
Journalist: Don?t you think that there will be a strong impact on the mindset of the people against a new Constitution when the Mahasngha opposes it?
Minister Senaratne: This is what has happened since 1958. When the Sinhala was made the State language, Tamil extremists said the Tamil language will be finished. But from what can be seen it was not so. Whether we need a new Constitution or not will be decided by the 225 parliamentarians and the people of this country. The final Constitutional draft is still to be finalised and the contents will be known only after that work was completed.
Minister Jayasekara: I don?t understand why this matter is discussed on the roadside, in boutiques and temples. It is unnecessary to do so. This country has suffered a lot because of extremism and malicious mindsets of a few. Not only Tamils and Muslims but even the Sinhalese have suffered a lot because of this kind of negative thinking. The final decision on power devolution and the unitary character of the country will be clearly stated in the final draft. We have not come to that stage up to now.
Journalist: But there is no consensus on the main issues like power devolution, the unitary character of the country and the executive presidency among the main two political parties -- the UNP and the SLFP and even within the parties.
Minister Jayasekara: That is what I say. We will introduce a draft Constitution that contains suggestions and the aspirations of all stakeholders. Parliament which convened as a Constitutional Assembly has appointed six committees to consider various proposals and there are six reports before the Constitutional Assembly. It is highly unethical to discuss these matters piecemeal.
Journalist: But there are different views among different people and groups on the new Constitution.
Minister Senaratne: That may be. But we have to consider the majority view. When Parliament approves the draft Constitution by a two-thirds majority it will become the basic law. However, if the Supreme Court rules that a referendum is necessary the government will have to conduct a referendum. Every effort to introduce a new Constitution will come to an end should the people reject the new Constitution at a referendum That is why the final say is with the people. It is glad to hear that TNA and Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan says that the Tamils will accept a Constitution only if the Sinhalese accept it.
Minister Jayasekara: We must keep in mind that introducing a new Constitution is not a job that should be done only by the Sinhalese. It must be a collective effort with the participation of all Sri Lankans and approved by all Sri Lankans.
A Tamil newspaper journalist: The statement issued by the Mahasangha has created a kind of antipathy among the Tamils. They think the attempt is to disrupt reconciliation and power sharing.
Minister Senaratne: This was what has happened right throughout. In 1972, Ms. Sirimavo Bandaranaike introduced a new Constitution to strengthen herself. In 1978, J.R. Jayewardene did the same by introducing the second Republican Constitution. Mahinda Rajapaksa introduced the 18th Amendment to the Constitution in 2010 to acquire absolute power as the executive and none of those leaders considered power devolution or reconciliation. The only person who did it was President Maithripala Sirisena who introduced the 19th Amendment and voluntarily pruned his own powers. He will not introduce a new Constitution without consulting all Sri Lankans.
Minister Jayasekara: No one, no organization nor any group must destroy this country. Besides, there is nothing for the government to hide. We are doing in a transparent and acceptable manner. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Newly introduced larva getting used to urban areas
	
A newly introduced larvae to control dengue has been released to the environment and they are getting used to the urban areas, Director of the Entomology and Parasitology Unit of the Medical Research Institute (MRI) Dr. Sagarika Samarasinghe told Daily Mirror yesterday.
She said, this larva called Toxorhynchites splendens was identified in 1911 in the world and used by different countries to control the spread of dengue with different success rates.
"The group headed by me started establishing the Toxorhynchites splendens colony in 2016. This is a tough research and therefore we can?t do it overnight. We have released these larvae to the environment several times without publicizing it, and this is the end result of the hard work and research conducted at the Medical Research Institute (MRI)," the doctor said.
Toxorhynchites splendens is about 19mm long and has a bluish-white metallic colour with a lifespan of 3 months. They mainly suck honey and plant juice. These larvae do not suck blood as their Proboscis has bent 90 degrees backwards. Therefore, no harm would be caused to humans. Their larva stage lasts for 5 weeks and this may exceed in cold climates.
These species are much bigger than the ordinary mosquitoes and are also called "elephant mosquito" or "mosquito eater". It is crucial to mention that these larvae are not herbivorous but carnivorous. These mosquitoes lay their eggs while flying. Hence, they can lay their eggs in places where we cannot reach and can consume dengue larvae in the hidden places," she said.
Dr. Samarasinghe categorically emphasized not to depend on this method alone as it will not be sufficient to wholly eliminate the dengue (Sheain Fernandopulle)

On watching ?Welikathara? after everything
	
The first time I watched Welikathara several years ago, I was stunned. The acting, the dialogues, the boldness of the editing, and the sheer confidence of the camerawork all seemed to come together. It seemed to be one of those rare movies that highlighted what they borrowed from and were inspired by without beating around the bush. How else could you explain its technical achievements, at once bold and overwhelming? Here was a real swinger, a real taker and box-office seducer. Here was a story that could keep everyone, or almost everyone, blissfully unaware of its own limitations. ?
To talk about Welikathara, an inspiringly restored copy of which has been screened at the Regal since last Friday, though, is to talk about many things; what it took from, the trend it set for our film industry, and how relevant it was for its time. ?
America was the birthplace of the myths of the 20th century, of gangsters who were invincible and of detectives who were even more invincible. ?I can?t think of gangsters without thinking about The Godfather,? Pauline Kael said, and she was correct, It was in France that the cinema was born, but it was in the USA that it was nurtured, popularising the myths that the world?s youngest democracy had created for itself. Hollywood was born from the peepshow, vaudeville, and music hall; it was destined to belong to the Chaplins and the Bogarts, the Chandlers and the Puzos. ?
Welikathara takes us back to those days when audiences went to the movies not for art, but for the sheer pleasure of watching a story that parsed. This was roughly the same kind of audience that patronised Hollywood in its heyday, and by that I mean the Hollywood of Raoul Walsh and John Ford and Howard Hawks and all those other directors who didn?t conceive of the cinema as an art, but as a narrative device that kept you (as Chandran Rutnam told me) from going to the bathroom because the story was so damn good. Someone told me that its restoration cost around six million rupees. It shows, aptly; the truth is that only a restoration that costly could do justice to such a disciplined, but underrated film (underrated today, that is). ?
Diongu Badaturuge Nihalsinghe, who would have turned 78 last May, was not born to a film background. His father was a newspaper mogul and a firm nationalist. At his school, Ananda College, he wound up as Head Prefect and Cadet Sergeant and dallied with the idea of joining the Army. All those youthful dreams were tossed out, however, when he began watching the movies. This was in the 1950s, when the Hollywood epics and Cinemascope invaded our theatres. A 16mm Bolex camera, gifted by his father, was all it took for him to turn to documentaries. Almost five years later, he was a cameraman, with Sath Samudura and Dahasak Sithuvili as his first two projects. Soon afterwards he was directing his debut, Welikathara. ?
That sense of hierarchy and discipline he encountered in his youth comes out in Welikathara. It?s a man of force, an Assistant Superintendent of Police, who takes centre-stage. He?s spurred into action, weakened by an almost Cape Fear-esque plotline (an old enemy harbouring a dark secret from his past turns out to be the ringleader operating in the area to which he?s assigned), and then spurred into action after his wife scorns his manhood. Welikathara reeks of masculinity and manhood. It?s driven by an almost right-wing devotion to authority, one of the many elements influenced by the American thriller of the forties and the fifties. ?
Quite apart from its technical achievement (as the first Cinemascope film in South Asia), what accentuated this aspect to the narrative was the acting. I have rarely seen a more ravishing performance from Gamini Fonseka, for instance. To watch him today is to appreciate how well he could embody the best of popular and serious acting. He?s so self-assured, so confident and cocky, that you can only root for him. ?
When, in that opening flashback sequence, a colleague of his (played by G. W. Surendra) ends the valedictory for his character, Wickrema Randeniya (influenced by alcohol, we suspect, as he rambles on about Caesar and Calpurnia), everyone claps and Gamini, before turning away, smiles rather contemptuously at him. He is amused, even faintly condescending, implying that only he has the prerogative to praise and celebrate himself properly. That was Gamini at his best; a little proud perhaps, but never lacking confidence, never unsure, never betraying his doubts. ?
Which perhaps is what riles us up when he does end up being compromised and questioned, as the story progresses. His wife Geetha, Swineetha Weerasinghe (then Abeysekara) lacks confidence and is turbulent. She loves him, but expects him to be devoted to the values his profession stands for. That is enough for her to dig up old dirt when his old enemy, Goring Mudalali, intrudes and goes away unchallenged. Her role is to catapult an already tense conflict into a debate over his integrity. Is Randeniya really that good, that virile, that manly? ?You earned a degree, you earned an ASP title to cap it all, but you still weren?t able to clean up this bloody mess!? she shouts at him, forcing him to do what we knew Gamini, at that point in his career, could do; slap her, then have his guilt revive that virility he had repressed. ?
It?s difficult to imagine Joe Abeywickrama as his adversary, but that?s what Tissa Abeysekara transformed him into. Critics never grow tired of contending how Welikathara unearthed his versatility, but I rather think that his versatility was always there, hidden underneath. He was endowed with certain physical features that would have turned him into a villain long, long before: those thick eyebrows, that rough, uneven face, and a voice which could covey both laughter and pathos. Gamini was a pampered prince in comparison. Joe, on the other hand, took to you spontaneously. ?
Perhaps that?s why these two were neither pitted against nor coupled with each other again thereafter, the same way, for instance, that Vijaya Kumaratunga and Sanath Gunathilake were during the eighties. Joe?s great achievement in Welikathara was forcing down Gamini to a moral quandary, one that not even a muddled up, hazy final encounter couldn?t do away with. The script was obviously Tissa Abeysekara?s, but about 10 minutes into that encounter we feel that some higher hand was at work, reshaping Goring from an invincible adversary to a pitiful stock villain-gunned-down. (And if that wasn?t incongruous enough, we have that obligatory final standoff where the wounded and dazed villain shoots several times and misses the hero, only to have the hero return the compliment by shooting him down with one bullet.) ?
It?s rather jarring when the same person who tossed memorable one-liners (?Asiyath ma gawa, buruwath ma gawa, name koleth ma gawa?) with an almost boyish grin and got away with everything could be reduced to such a pathetic figure. But despite whatever transformation he was compelled to undergo to sustain Gamini?s populist image, Randeniya?s moral quandary could never truly be resolved. ?
So Randeniya does what all men of honour would have done in that situation (he?ll never be reconciled to his wife; she turns away when he visits her in hospital): shoot himself. To have Gamini Fonseka commit suicide, however, would have been too unbearable to audiences back then, so he saved himself the ignominy with another plotted contrivance: his father, the honourable Rate Mahaththaya, fathered the woman he impregnated and then abandoned to the fury of Sudu Bande (Goring Mudalali). That plot-device, however, is really a plot-hole; it leaves many questions unanswered and far from patching up the story, it actually brings out the other plot-holes (like the following; how could someone like Sudu Bande, given his reduced circumstances, rise up to become a powerful ringleader so quickly?). ?
Despite that, though, I was ready to forgive him because Welikathara wasn?t really meant to be taken seriously. Like the movies of the Walshes and the Wilders of the forties and fifties, there was a sense of self-contempt and irony lurking underneath. I felt it as I waded through that montage sequence chronicling Randeniya?s conquests; it flows like a newsreel, but it?s actually a point of contrast to his later downfall. It?s crazily cynical, so cynical that it reeks of noirishness and even imprisons the audience (most of the arguments are shot from two frames that cut to each other, almost claustrophobically) so much that the final standoff in the long, hot desert isn?t as liberating as you thought it would be: it just makes everything even more cynical. I fervently believe that was Nihalsinghe?s real achievement. ?
But I also believe that?s what repelled our adherents of art cinema and took them to a completely different terrain. Welikathara was defeatist, but never as defeatist as the Europeans. It was a decade of hopes being shattered, of ideals being questioned. We were moving away from the self-limited realism of the past. Nihalsinghe?s movie, on that count, was a quirk, one which he himself didn?t indulge in, as Ridi Nimnaya, Maldeniye Simion, and even Keli Madala (a lesser work) clearly showed. ?
Whether we should regret this, of course, is debatable; coupled with the infrastructural issues that troubled our industry in the eighties, the commercial cinema was destined to be estranged from art cinema. Welikathara was the only movie that tried to bring the latter to the audiences which doted on the former. That it succeeded despite everyone moving away from it, I think, speaks a lot about what might have been. Entertainment and art never cohabited in this country, not in the cinema and not in the theatre. That is sad, but I think we were all complicit in it, one way or the other. ?
NOTE: While meticulously restored, the copy I saw at the Regal was missing certain scenes from what I had watched earlier. In particular, the first few shots of that confrontation between Randeniya and Geetha after Goring intrudes on them and then leaves unchallenged were missing, a pity because they lay down the unforgiving, claustrophobic mood of what unfolds thereafter.

Parliament fires up over draft Constitution
	
Parliament erupted in heated arguments today when joint opposition parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardane charged that a draft of the Constitution has been presented at a recent seminar at the BMICH.
Mr. Gunawardane said the most Ven. Maha Nayaka Theras were alarmed as article nine of the Constitution under the status of Buddhism was to be taken away. He said this had been stated in a document which was distributed at the BMICH seminar.
Chief opposition whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake said if a document was distributed at the BMICH it was wrongas such a thing cannot happen when the steering committee had not come to an agreement on any draft.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who responded said what was available as of today were summaries of different proposals that had been placed before the steering committee. "The Steering committee had not come up with any draft. I will not allow the amendment of article nine as long as I remain the chairman of the steering committee," he said.
Mr. Gunawardane then argued that the Prime Minister could not deny that there was a proposal by some elements to amend article nine, while highlighting that cabinet spokesman Rajitha Senaratne had no right to state that the Maha Nayaka Theras had nothing to fear. He was referring to a statement made by Dr Senaratne at the cabinet briefing.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe later said he had inquired from the steering committee whether any draft had been put out. "I inquired from the steering committee and they have informed me that no draft had been put out" he therefore said.(Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

People never gave mandate for referendums, Ven. Rathana Thera
	
The people did not mandate to this government for Constitutional reforms that would necessitate a referendum, National Council of Sri Lanka Chairman Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera said today.
The Thera told a media briefing that President Maithripala Sirisena?s Presidential election manifesto stated that he would never permit to a Constitutional reform resulted from a referendum.
Ven. Rathana Thera said around 6.2 million people who believed in President Sirisena?s manifesto voted him to office to uphold the country?s sovereignty and unitary state. Therefore he cannot implement anything against what he promised to establish, the Thera said.
He also said TNA MP M. A. Sumanthiran who made a statement in Parliament that the government should go for a referendum earlier agreed the President Sirisena?s manifesto had not promised to do so.
TheThera said most countries that opted to Constitutional reforms ended up in tragedy so President Sirisena should not permit such a move and drag the country and its people to a calamity.
He warned the government that the country could not steer according to cheap political agendas and President Sirisena who was appointed by the people?s mandate cannot act against the people's will.
He also said the Executive Presidency should not be abolished as it is the only hope in a situation of an unstable Parliament.
Meanwhile, Rathana Thera appreciated the statement made by the Tri party Mahanayaka Theras and said government should not criticize it as it was their sacred duty over the past to come forward and protect the country and its people when it is in danger. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Port City a vital cog in China's OBOR initiative: CHEC
	
The Colombo International Financial City (CIFC), formally known as the Colombo Port City, would play an instrumental role in China?s One Belt and One Road (OBOR) initiative because of Sri Lanka?s strategic location on the maritime silk route, the CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt.) Ltd. said.
Liang Thow Ming, the Chief Sales and Marketing Officer of the CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt.) Ltd., told a Sri Lankan media delegation at the CHEC office in Beijing, China on Tuesday that the CIFC fulfils the needs and the aspirations of both China and Sri Lanka.
?Where China is concerned, we have the OBOR initiative and Sri Lanka is right in the middle of the maritime silk route. Therefore, CIFC plays a vital role there. Where Sri Lanka is concerned, it is looking at massive infrastructure investment and development in order to reinvigorate and uplift the economy,? he said.
He assured those present that though the project had suffered a setback by getting delayed by a year due to the suspension of operations in March 2016, it would be completed by 2041, giving Sri Lanka a world class city for South Asia.
He said that they want to lift Colombo to the same level of top metropolitan cities in the world. ?We want to put Singapore in Colombo or Dubai and maybe Tokyo. That?s what we are trying to do,? Mr. Ming said.
He said the CIFC project was an investment amounting to US$1.4 billion just for land reclamation and construction.
In terms of tourism, Mr. Ming said they were expecting to make Colombo a stopover destination for tourists by luring them to the CIFC. ?Colombo is not a stop-over destination for tourists at the moment. They bypass it most of the time. When tourists arrive in Sri Lanka, they can visit so many other parts of the country but most don?t want to see Colombo,? he explained.
The reclaimed land of the CIFC would be separated into five precincts; Central Park Living with a channel and open areas, Financial District, International Island, The Marina and Island Living.
Mr. Ming said that they were also creating a lagoon, 300 metres in width, adjacent to the Galle face Green, making it safe for people to swim in.
Though the breakwater creation had been affected by the work suspension suffered by their company, the reclamation of the land taking place was on schedule and 45 per cent of the work had already been completed as of now, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla in Beijing)

SL take 2-1 lead over Zimbabwe with win in 3rd ODI
	
Sri Lanka cruised to an emphatic win by 8 wickets in 47.2 overs against Zimbabwe in the third match of the 5-match ODI series after they chased down a target of 311 runs at Hambantota to take 2-1 lead during the process. Riding on an opening stand of over 200 runs between Dickwella and Gunathilaka, the hosts chased down the mammoth target in overs.
Earlier, Zimbabwe scored 310/8 in allotted 50 overs after opener Hamilton Masakadza notched up his fifth ODI hundred. Masakadza put on a partnership of 127 runs for the second wicket with Musakanda before the two batsmen were sent back in the hut. Sri Lanka looked to restrict Zimbabwe for a lesser total but a cameo from Peter Moor down the order guided his side to go over 300-run mark. Here?s what how Twitter reacted on Sri Lanka?s win.

US proceeds with military exercise after N. Korea missile test
By Emily Rauhala ? ?BEIJING - Tensions over North Korea?s July 4 missile test mounted Wednesday, with the U.S. and South Korean forces conducting military exercises and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un appearing to personally taunt the president of the United States. ?
The latest launch was a display of the North?s longest-reaching weapon yet - an intercontinental ballistic missile with a range that experts say covers Alaska. It now sharply boosts pressure on President Donald Trump and his allies to carve out a strategy on North Korea amid deep international divisions over how to respond to an increasingly defiant regime in Pyongyang. ?
In a stark warning, top U.S. and South Korean commanders said the North risked tipping the peninsula toward war. ?
Before his inauguration, Trump said North Korea?s plan to develop an ICBM capable of hitting the United States ?won?t happen? and has since made tough talk on the issue a signature. ?
Trump?s main strategy to rein in North Korea had counted on help from China, which is the North?s main financial lifeline. On Wednesday, Trump further called out China for failing to tighten the economic noose. ?
Now with Trump?s China outreach apparently on the rocks, there were few clear signs on how to seek international agreement on dealing with the North?s missile programme. ?
The focus on Chinese efforts has exasperated Beijing, which insists it has done its part to pressure Pyongyang and resents being singled out. ??
?The international community has no solutions,? said Song Xiaojun, who used to run a government linked-military magazine. ?The U.S. wants to transfer the burdens to China.? ?

'Turning blind eye on burning issues': Govt. only keen on new Constitution: JO
	
The government is keen on making amendments to the Constitution despite many other burning issues in the country including the dengue epidemic, garbage issues and the economic crisis, the joint opposition alleged today.
Joint opposition member Rohitha Abeygunawardana told a news conference that the government attempting to fulfil promises made during the pre-election period to several parties by making amendments to the Constitution.
?These amendments will lead the state to federalism. Even the Mahanayaka Theras of the three Nikayas and other Sangha Sabhas have unanimously decided there was no need to bring in a new Constitution or an Amendment to the Constitution,? the MP added.
He said the government was continuing a silence policy with regard to the burning issues of the country. He also said this government would not be able to persist in such a manner for a longtime.
Meanwhile, MP Abeygunawardana said the government was trying to suppress the media and journalists by introducing new Acts to prevent them from exposing the truth.
He said a group of non-governmental organizations (NGO) were in process of making rules and regulations to establish an Act on media institutes and journalists and alleged that it would result in imprisonment of journalists; ?The government is attempting to continue its procedure in a deceitful manner,? he added.

Uma Oya Project: Drilling operations suspended
	
The Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry today announced the suspension of drilling operations in the Uma Oya Project for ten days until a solution was found for the water leakage that had taken place.
Ministry Secretary Anura Dissanayake said the project was suspended and that all the drilling machines would be withdrawn from the lower level of the tunnel within ten days.
The suspension came after President Maithripala Sirisena called those involved in the Uma Oya Project for a meeting to attempt to find a solution to the situation that had arisen in the area surrounding the project.
During the meeting the decision on suspendeding of the project was taken as an initial step to control the situation. The President had ordered a sum of Rs.300 million to be allocated to the Badulla District Secretary's office to provide relief to the people of the area after getting an estimate done on the damage caused as a result of the project. He also called for a report from the National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) on the amount of damage caused.
It was also reported drilling machinery utilising modern technology would be flown in from Switzerland before July 18. This was in response to a request made by President Sirisena during his official visit to Switzerland in March. Further excavation work would be done based on the instructions of international experts who were due in the country soon.
During the meeting with the President the following decisions were taken:
1) The establishment of a special valuation unit to speed up the process of valuation, by deploying additional valuation officers even if it meant recruiting retired valuation officers on contract basis.
2) The three water supply projects implemented by the National Water Supply and Drainage Board to be considered on a priority basis and completed within the next two months and connections provided free of charge.
3) To ensure that there will not be a scarcity of drinking water for the residents of the areas devastated by constructing six deep wells in areas where ground water resources exist by the NWS&DB under the Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources Management.
4) The Forest Conservation Department to undertake a community based programme in widening the activities of planting local and endemic plants in the relevant areas with the aim of conservation of natural ground water resources. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
