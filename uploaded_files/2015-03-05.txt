Ensure past failures aren't repeated ? UN HR chief
	
	UN Human Rights chief Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein has called upon the government of Sri Lanka to ensure that failures of the past are not repeated.
	The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights made these remarks yesterday, in his annual report that was delivered at the ongoing 28th UNHRC session in Geneva where he had stressed on the importance of seizing the chance offered by the 'one-time only' deferral of the OISL (OHCHR Investigation on Sri Lanka) report, in establishing a foundation that would ensure lasting peace and reconciliation in Sri Lanka.
	He had also urged the Sri Lankan authorities to consult deeply with the people, particularly the victims in formulating a mechanism that would ensure accountability and lay the foundations for peace and reconciliation.
	"This is a singular opportunity for the government," he had said while noting that he made the decision to grant the request for the deferral of the report based on the assessment of the changing context in Sri Lanka as well as the broad signals of cooperation from the GoSL and the possibility of the availability of new information.
	Furthermore, the High Commissioner had also commended the government's agreement to invite him as well as the several other UN teams including the Special Rapporteur on Truth, Justice, Reparations and Guarantees of non-recurrence and the working group on enforced and involuntary disappearances,to visit Sri Lanka before the sessions in September.
	"During this period, the OHCHR staff also plans to engage on the ground with all stakeholders to advance transitional justice issues," he had noted. (Lakna Paranamanna)

Karunaratne out of World Cup with broken finger
	
	Sri Lanka batsman Dimuth Karunaratne has been ruled out of the World Cup after a fracturing the little finger on his left hand at practice in Sydney.
	"Dimuth injured his hand during a fielding session and X-rays indicated a fracture just above the base of his left small finger," Sri Lanka's chairman of selectors Sanath Jayasuriya said.
	"Dimuth has to undergo surgery and will be out for about four weeks. He will return home and we have requested the ICC technical committee to include leg-spinner Seekkuge Prasanna in the squad as his replacement."
	Prasanna was sent to Australia as cover for left-arm spinner Rangana Herath, who had four stitches to his left index finger after hurting himself while trying to hold onto a difficult return catch from Jos Butler in Wellington. Herath is an uncertain starter for Sunday's match against Australia in Sydney.
	In addition to Prasanna, Sri Lanka hope to bolster their batting by flying in Kusal Perera from home. "We have only seven fit batsmen in the side and Kusal is being brought in as a precautionary measure," Jayasuriya said.
	Karunaratne is the fourth Sri Lankan player to be injured from the originally selected squad. Fast bowler Dhammika Prasad broke his hand two days out from their first warm-up fixture in the World Cup and allrounder Jeevan Mendis suffered a hamstring injury at training on February 24.
