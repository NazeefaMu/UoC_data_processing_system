The SLFP and the Joint Opposition will not keep quiet about the changes that were taking place in the country today, former President and Kurunegala UPFA MP Mahinda Rajapaksa said.
Speaking at the 80th celebration of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) the former President said the citizens were now witnessing an age where they were waiting for ships to bring in supplies.
?It is an age where school children have been given coupons instead of uniforms; parents spend more on getting the coupons than the material taken from coupons. The system was brought on, to stop giving out uniforms,? he said.
The former President went on to say the country would again be divided on racial and ethnic lines and development has come to a complete stop.
?They said we pocketed 90 per cent and made the roads with the remaining 10 per cent. They asked us if we made the roads in gold and then they said they would make the Colombo - Kandy expressway, a plan that we brought in, with just 10 per cent of the original Rs. 2 billion that was proposed. Now they are saying the cost of the expressway is Rs. 4 billion,? he said.
The former President also said the LSSP with other leftist parties should lead the protest against the current government and even though the party was not represented in parliament it could not be taken away from the people.(Muditha Dayananda)

No foreign companies to mine gems in SL: President
	
	President Maithripala Sirisena said he will not allow foreign companies to enter into gem mining industry in the country.
	?During the time I was the Common Candidate for the Presidential Election, the people requested me not to let the foreign companies mine gems in Sri Lanka. After I was elected as the President, I took every action to stop such mining by foreign companies as soon as I got to know about those?, he said.
	The President made these remarks at the opening ceremony of the National Gem and Jewelry Exhibition at the BMICH on Saturday.
	He pointed out it is essential to provide the mechanical and technical knowledge to those who are engaged in the gem industry, for its growth. ?The government will provide every facility in this regard?, the President said.
	?When I presented a gem to Queen Elizabeth at the recent meeting, she showed her gems and jewels and said they were made of the gems from Sri Lanka. This shows the interest of foreign countries for Sri Lankan gems?, the President said.
	?Though the demand for Sri Lankan tea and rubber have decreased in the international market, the demand for our gems is increasing. Hence, the gem industry has a special contribution for the increase of the foreign income?, the President further stated.
	President Sirisena presented an award of appreciation to Mr. Dayananda Dillamuni, a member of the Gemmologists Association of Sri Lanka, for his contribution for the development of the gem industry. The President also presented certificates to six Gemmology Diploma Graduates of Sri Lanka Gem and Jewellery Association.
