A view of Independence: To whom should we be grateful
	
From the beginning of this month leading up to the fourth, I heard every day the drone of aircraft engines and watched aeroplanes fly in formation over my head. It was a beautiful spectacle against the backdrop of a clear blue sky. The occasion was the celebration of independence on February 4, and this was Sri Lanka Air Force training for the sky parade.
The fly-past practices were obviously to fine-tune the formations flown by Air Force pilots. The display was going to be over the Galle Face to showcase their skills. What flying I saw on the days prior to independence celebrations were very good, correct speed, correct line and the flying was well-coordinated and accurately done.
On the fourth, the parades coloured the Galle Face, attended by the high and the mighty and their honoured invitees in comfortable seats under the shades. Of course, we, the ordinary lesser beings, were on the electronic screens at home. The spectacle was all about the prowess of colonial-freed Mother Lanka governed by her own sons and daughters. Independence is an absolute must celebration. It is the pride of a once-shackled nation. Those who have been under the yoke of colonial powers should remember the freedoms they have achieved and cherish the thought of shedding chains that bound us when the New World conquered the natives of this planet. Sure there must be a celebration, but what kind And why And what should we be celebrating Most importantly who should we be grateful to


I watched the Dialog version of the spectacle. The marching soldiers were a treat on the screen. The tri-forces displayed perfection as they marched representing their various units. Along with them rolled their hardware-loaded battle vehicles. Their commitment to serve the country was on clear display and these are the young men and women in uniform to whom we should ever be grateful. They are the custodians of our homeland and our hope in the event of crisis. It wasnt long ago that their comrades from these very same units paraded for independence celebrations of yester-year. Then they packed their bags and carried their firearms and went to the North or to the East to fight and die for a country to save its Sovereignty. Shallow unmarked graves in sand dunes in the shade of scanty Palmyrah trees do bear witness to their sorrowful sacrifices. Maybe a faded photograph keeps a memory alive in a semi-shanty home of loved ones who wept, or a line in a granite war memorial carries a name supposed to be for eternal remembrance. The story ends there of how the country was liberated, by those who shed their blood, mostly anonymous. It was our forces, our soldiers, who fought their war to free our country. The ones on the march in 2017 were of the same thread, irrespective of which regiment they belonged to. Maybe there is some mistake here in the true sense of gratitude. The leaders sipping cool drinks and sitting in the shade appeared to be the curators of our independent nation. They are the ones who get the salute from the masses that march in the hot sun.


"In the wilderness of my weird imagination, I see a different parade. Why not keep the VVIPs in the fancy marquis along with their high-brass company and change the marchers Let the tri-forces take a rest; they have done enough for their motherland"

It sure brings out the embarrassing question, to whom must we be grateful
So we had a march past on Galle Face and the platoon leader yelled eyes right and the troops turned their heads in unison to honour the leaders who govern our independent homeland. The aeroplanes flew overhead in formation, fast jets, slower transport planes and hovering helicopters. The Navy had their gunboats drew sea-sprayed white lines across aquamarine waves demonstrating manoeuvers that made them look mercurial.
Every possible armed force was represented in the smartly uniformed service personnel marching in precision. All this while Diyawanna Oya stood ramrod straight and watched the pageant basking in counterfeit glory as if all that Sri Lanka achieved for the last 69 years was solely and directly due to the magnificent governance politicians have given to our beloved homeland. (Among the whitened sepulchers there definitely were decent committed leaders. But that is a small numerical at present, getting smaller by the day and appearing sadly as going fast into extinction).
In the wilderness of my weird imagination, I see a different parade. Why not keep the VVIPs in the fancy marquis along with their high-brass company and change the marchers Let the tri-forces take a rest; they have done enough for their motherland.
Lets get the real show on the road. Why not fill the parade with those that stand in front of the Fort Railway station carrying the protest placards seeking justice for the mismanagements and corruptions of our rulers There would be so many, some right and some wrong, but who would know the difference The Lipton Circus clan, the SAITM objectors, the Bond Avengers all can be part of the parade. They can also add more to colour the procession, COPE committee, Bribery Commission, FCID, Civil Rights Movements, Voice against Corruption and many others of similar interests so that the country would know whether we should be celebrating or crying in shame. If in our imagination such a march ever takes place, they should blare by loud-speakers to the nation Nanda Malini Gokulas immortal song Avurudu Dedahas Panseeyak. The lyrics match perfectly, that sure is the truth.


"Every newspaper everyday has more headlines on corruption and mismanagement than any happy tidings. When is all this going to end When is Mother Lanka going to make a U turn and move on a genuine path
of progress"

Anun kotawala, Agul atawala rajawethi mage un hamadamath
Mage raja daruwan mage jana daruwan gena baluwe naa kawadawath.
Doesnt it say it all Especially the second line, how Mother Lankas rulers NEVER took care of the people of this country.
Amidst the blowing of shining brass instruments that trumpeted marching rhythms and the thump-thump of jack boots to the drum beats and the clash of cymbals the organisers should have broken the fanfare and taken a little break to respect the truth. Lets take an honest audit of the journey we have travelled for 69 years. True, there was a conflict for 30 years that almost ruined the entire nation. But what about the aftermath Political leaders have had time and space to charter our path from 2009. What did they do What is the truth Do we really know or have an inkling of what happened and what is happening in the ivory towers of Diyawanna Oya The proletariat is mostly like headless chicken running around with vanishing hopes of a promised land. We have heard the wail of who stole millions and who stashed away billions almost like the national anthem. But where is the justice Has anyone gone to jail Of course some are in remand custody but they do get instant illnesses and shift their lodging to hospital beds. That is only the tip of the iceberg.


Forget the 69 years of freedom. Lets look at what happened from 2009 after the conflict was over. Two leaderships governed us. Of course there was some progress. Lets not deny that. But what about the mortal sins that came out of Diyawanna Oya Every newspaper everyday has more headlines on corruption and mismanagement than any happy tidings. When is all this going to end When is Mother Lanka going to make a U turn and move on a genuine path of progress Arent we, the ordinary Sri Lankans entitled to it Look at those little children in lily-white uniforms representing every race and religion. It is their country and their future and their basic human rights that we are blasting away by tolerating the culture of politics that is being practiced.
It is almost a year to the 70 years of freedom celebration. 2018 is sure to have a big bash by whoever rules Diyawanna Oya. As Sri Lankans, let us hope that at least in this remaining eleven months we will see some genuine progress before the next celebration. We are not asking for the moon, not even a tree top, but basic rights to live in our God-gifted homeland and be governed by reasonable people who show some sensibilities and integrity. Of course the unanimous plea of all of us would be a common prayer, to see at least some sort of a reduction in the corridors of corruption.
That then would be the yardstick and the catalyst to celebrate independence and to sincerely know towhom we should be grateful.

Cannot ban big matches: Minister
	
In response to the call made by a group of Buddhist monks to ban school big matches, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam today said they cannot do so.
The Minister said the call was not new and there had been requests in the past as well to ban big matches.
We cant ban school big matches. It is not a practical move to tackle students undisciplined actions, he told the Daily Mirror.
However, the minister said they have had a discussion with school Principals recently to take preventive measures to tackle possible violent incidents among students during the impending school sports season.
Minister Kariyawasam said they have given instructions to law enforcement authorities including the Police Chief to take action to minimize incidents which cause public nuisance during the big matches. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Deaf couple hear each other for the first time in 12 YEARS of marriage
	

This is the emotional moment a deaf couple hear each others voices for the first time in 12 years of marriage - after their cochlear implants were switched on. 
Neil and Helen Robinson have both been deaf since birth and have communicated through sign language, lip reading and failed attempts at using hearing aids. 
But they have become the first-ever couple to receive cochlear implants at the University of Southampton Audiology Implant Service (USAIS). 
The emotional moment the devices were first switched on was captured on video - with Neil, 50, at first joking that he didnt like the sound of his wifes voice. But he added: I am getting used to it now. It felt incredible, in a happy way. It felt really emotional. 
Amazingly, Neil reckons his new-found hearing could have saved his life after stepping out of the way of an oncoming car after hearing it before he saw it. The couple, who live near Salisbury, Wiltshire, were born deaf due to both of their mothers contracting rubella during pregnancy. 
Despite their audio impairment they have lived full and happy lives - they have raised a son, and Neil is an Assistant Curate at Salisbury Cathedral. 
Helen, 54, tried for two years to persuade Neil to have an implant and he finally agreed after frustrating attempts at using hearing aids. 
They first underwent surgery by Tim Mitchell, a consultant Ear, Nose and Throat surgeon at the Nuffield Health Wessex Hospital in Eastleigh, Hampshire. The implant consists of two parts that sit on the inside and outside of the skull just above the ear and are joined by a magnet. 
Information from the processor on the outside of the skull is sent to 16 electrodes on the inside, which then send electrical pulses to the brain. 
The devices were switched on at the centre in January and they were tested with sounds such as a beating drum and a musical triangle. 
The implants will now have to be fine-tuned and it is not clear how much hearing they will eventually recover. 
USAIS has fitted 1,000 of the gadgets since opening in 1990 but this is the first time they have been supplied to a couple. 
Cochlear implants were originally thought to only benefit people who had recently lost their hearing and already had speech and language skills.

Decision on SAITM after talking to all stakeholders: President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena said today he would arrive at a just and fair decision on private universities including the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in consultation with all stakeholders.
He met the SAITM students' Parents Collective and SAITM Chairman Dr. Neville Fernando on Monday at the President's official residence as one of the moves to sort out this contentious issue.
I will study the views expressed by parents and students with the hope of finding a solution, the President said adding that he had also met representatives of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) the Government Dental Surgeons Association (GDSA) and the University students unions and would meet officials of the UGC and the SLMC shortly.
Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA) said yesterday that as a representative of all grades of doctors in the country, it was not against properly constituted and regulated Private Medical Education and that Private Medical Education and SAITM though related, were two separate issues.
SLMA President Prof. Chandrika Wijeratne said her association was deeply concerned about the implications of the current situation on the health sector and the people.
We consider this to be a defining moment in the history of medical practice in our country which may lead to grave consequences, she said adding that Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) mandate on maintaining the standards of the medical profession and medical education is now being questioned and this has been brought to light by the recent Court of Appeal verdict.
Prof. Wijeratne said the SLMA was particularly concerned about the SLMC having limited powers to regulate medical education.
"Therefore, there is an urgent need to enact the required legislation to empower the SLMC to protect the public from unqualified or substandard medical practitioners. As an initial effort we urge the authorities to enactment the required gazette notification for the implementation of the Minimal Standards of Medical Education in our country," she said.

Designer gene
	

A dying baby whose life was saved by a pioneering designer gene technique has remained cancer-free more than a year on, prompting hopes of a potential cure. 
Doctors treating one-year-old Layla for leukaemia had warned her parents she had run out of options after chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant failed to halt the aggressive disease. 
But a ground-breaking technique allowed scientists to create designer immune cells to help her own body to fight back, and 20 months later she is still healthy and leukaemia-free. 
Experts hope that Layla, now two, will prove to be the first person in the world to be saved by the gene editing technique. 
Those behind her treatment at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) in London now hope the breakthrough could pave the way for future cures for other diseases. 
It comes after scientists announced last week that techniques to edit human genetic code could cure all inherited diseases within a generation, with two major US research institutions recommending that gene editing of human eggs, sperm and embryos should be allowed in medical research. 
Layla was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia  the most common form of cancer in children  when she was just 14 weeks old. 
Doctors described her case as one of the most aggressive we have ever seen and began chemotherapy, but both it and a subsequent bone marrow transplant failed. 
Her parents were warned she was dying, but GOSH consultants began working with scientists from University College London to try the experimental gene therapy. 
It had only been trialled on mice, but Laylas family was adamant doctors should try the treatment, and the team received special approval to use it on a human patient for the first time. 

They took immune system cells, known as T-cells, from a healthy donor and added new genes to them to help them seek out and destroy the leukaemia. 
Unlike conventional gene therapy, they also used molecular scissors to snip away bits of the T-cells DNA that would have attacked Laylas other, healthy cells. 
Gene editing also meant they could strip out elements which would have caused Laylas body to reject the donor cells. 
Just weeks after she was given a single 1ml infusion of the edited T-cells, doctors saw test results that showed the treatment was working. 
Now, 20 months after the procedure, tests have shown no sign of the leukaemia. The treatment has since been used on a 15-month-old girl with the same form of cancer, who is now in recovery. 
Laylas mother Lisa told the Sunday Times: We were so worried that it wouldnt work and when the doctors told us her cancer had gone we couldnt believe it. 
Were so grateful to all the doctors and nurses at GOSH for everything theyve done for us. We wish we could give them a Nobel prize. 
Waseem Qasim, a professor of cell and gene therapy at UCL and a consultant immunologist at GOSH, said the T-cell treatment was still undergoing trials, but could be used in the future against other blood cancers in adults and children.

DFCCs Know & Grow interactive digital campaign creates customer engagement
	
DFCC Bank launched the Know & Grow digital campaign to coincide with Independence Day, which was conceptualised by the bank to educate the public on the Sri Lankan flag and its elements.
The digital campaign was created based on the insight that although the Sri Lankan Flag is one of the most searched fields on Google in Sri Lanka, most people are not aware of what each element of the flag stands for. DFCC used this insight to devise a creative digital campaign whereby users were given the chance to assemble the Sri Lankan flag in the interactive gaming interface using the elements, whilst being educated on what each element represents. Those who successfully completed the game were rewarded with a gift, which they could collect from the nearest DFCC branch.campaign, Arjun Fernando  CEO, DFCC Bank, said, DFCC Bank is continually looking at ways to add value to the citizens of the country. The launch of the Know & Grow campaign through a digital concept this Independence, is an initiative for the public to engage with the Bank and enhance their knowledge. We are particularly pleased to have created an easy-to-use digital interface that is both engaging and one that relates to people of all ages. As a home-grown institution, DFCC Bank is committed to empowering citizens through public interest initiatives while enhancing lives towards growth with our innovative financial solutions.

## Title: Dickwella suspended by ICC for 2 limited-over matches

Dickwella suspended by ICC for 2 limited-over matches
	
Niroshan Dickwella has been suspended for two limited-over matches after his accumulated demerit points reached five within a 24-month period following his latest breach of the ICC Code of Conduct for which he received a 30 per cent fine and two demerit points.
During the second Twenty20 International against Australia in Geelong on Sunday, Dickwella was found guilty of breaching article 2.1.5 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Player and Player Support Personnel, which relates to showing dissent at an umpires decision during an international match.
As Dickwella had received a 50 per cent fine and three demerit points in the fourth One-Day International against South Africa in Cape Town on 8 February 2017, with the addition of these two demerit points, he has reached the minimum threshold of four demerit points, which, pursuant to article 7.6 of the Code, have now been converted into two suspension points. Two suspension points equate to a ban from one Test or two ODIs or two T20Is, whatever comes first for the player. As such, Dickwella has been suspended from his sides third Twenty20 International against Australia to be played in Adelaide on 22 February as well as the next limited overs match he is likely to play, which is currently scheduled to be the first One-Day International against Bangladesh on 25 March.
The five demerit points will remain on Dickwellas disciplinary record for a period of twenty-four months from their imposition and if he reaches eight or more demerit points within a 24-month period, then they will be converted into four suspension points. Four suspension points equate to a ban from two Tests or four ODIs or four T20Is, whatever comes first for the player.
The incident in Geelong happened when Dickwella, after being given out caught behind, paused to view the replay, kicked the turf and looked at his shoulder for a prolonged period of time. In a related incident, Australia wicketkeeper, Tim Paine, has been fined 15 per cent of his match fee and received one demerit point for breaching Article 2.1.7 of the Code, which relates to using language, actions or gestures which disparage or which could provoke an aggressive reaction from a batsman upon his/her dismissal during an International Match.
The incident happened when Paine used inappropriate words after Dickwella had been given caught behind. The charges were leveled by on-field umpires Simon Fry and Sam Nogajski, third umpire Joel Wilson and fourth official Michael Graham-Smith. For all first offences, Level 1 breaches carry a minimum penalty of an official reprimand, a maximum penalty of 50 per cent of a players match fee, and one or two demerit points.

From the fastest genocide to the Singapore of Africa Lessons from Rwanda
	
Ernest Rwamucyo is the High Commissioner of Rwanda to India. He is also accredited to Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. Prior to his appointment to India, he was the High Commissioner of Rwanda to the United Kingdom and the non-resident ambassador to Ireland and was awarded 2012 diplomat of the year from Africa by the Diplomat Magazine in London. The Daily Mirror was able to speak to High Commissioner Rwamucyo during his recent visit for the Independence Day celebrations on a few aspects that Sri Lanka and Asia as a whole can learn from Rwanda. He shared the following:-
Diplomatic relations between Rwanda and Sri Lanka were established in 2011. Do you see any notable highlights over the last 5 years 
It is a vibrant and fast growing relationship. Over the last few years, there has been an increased exchange in trade, education and the sharing of water management and irrigation skills. We have conducted trade activities with the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, exchange programmes, and Sri Lanka also has an Honorary Consul. Quite a number of MOUs are now being signed in relation to defence and broader education and technology exchange such as the mining, cutting and polishing of gems. We need to learn these technologies that Sri Lanka is skilled in. Rwanda has a friendly business environment and is open to Sri Lanka to invest and partner with. We can see some of the big Sri Lankan companies establishing their businesses in Rwanda. 
Rwanda is growing but we have a big skills gap so we are open to Sri Lankans who want to explore opportunities and bring skills to help our growth. We have also just joined the Commonwealth and with countries like India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka also part of it we are looking at areas such as trade, business, investment, education and health. We have been building upon these with Sri Lanka for a while and we can boast of a healthy partnership in the education sector with 32 Rwandan students studying in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka is growing very strongly and as such there is much collaboration in the tea sector as well. There is a lot that can be done as I have seen in the last three and a half years. 
In the period right after the 1990s genocide, countries such as the US and the UK were heavily involved in helping Rwanda rebuild itself and recover. With such close links to major powers, does Rwanda have an independent foreign policy or does it reflect the interests of these countries 
Our foreign policy is influenced by experience we went through which was one of conflict and genocide. For us post-genocide reconciliation centred around opening up the country to the global community since part of the challenge we faced was being closed and inward looking. Therefore we decided to open and link up with other countries in order to be an active member in the international community. This is the reason why we joined the East African Community and then eventually the Commonwealth. In addition we reached out to other countries that we saw a mutual interest in, in the areas of tourism, trade, investment, and business. This has been a major driving factor in our post genocide policy. 
Yes, we have good relationships with the UK and the USA but we also receive benefits from our links with countries like Sri Lanka so it is all about opening up the country. 
Rwanda has seen a digital revolution with the use of e-Book readers and smartphones in libraries. Why is this so important keeping in mind the disparity between Rwanda and other countries that are constantly involved in the development of technology 
It is because it is crucial for development. We started about a decade ago by rolling out fibre optic cables for high speed internet. Many of our economic partners did not approve of this move as a solution for a poor country and advised that we should use these resources for social protection and health. But we firmly believed that IT works for the poor and IT works for better delivery of health, education and social protection and the investment was necessary to build it into to an economic and social hub in the region. Now everyone understands the benefits. Everyone has access to 4G internet. Costs have come down and it delivers essential services to citizens. We can deliver education and the quality of education improves. We have a one laptop per child plan for this. IT is used to deliver healthcare by connecting villages with mobile phones so that they can call health services. This has a high impact in reducing child and maternal mortality. It also helped in the roll out of phones in the country and for people to access bank accounts. We are also a tourist country. People want to be connected and when people visit our country due to the access to connectivity they stay longer. 

"Within Sri Lanka, there are some values and traditions that should inspire the country. Sri Lanka has done very well in the immediate aftermath and to be where you are right now, and it is incredible so see the growth and the will of the people. We are very impressed with what the country has achieved and I see the future is very bright"

Rwanda has made great strides in gender equality. Recently the Women and Equality Committee ranked it number one in parliamentary equality. How important are representation and quotas and would this work in Asia which is by nature a patriarchal society 
We had the realization that women are half of the population so we cant leave one half out. One strategy was to increase the participation of women in decision making. This was achieved through constitutional reform which involved quotas. This increased the quota of women in parliament; they now make up 64% of parliament. This has translated into judiciary, the Cabinet and local levels as well. This also involves the rolling out of education. Sri Lanka has done very well with free education since this offers opportunity to both genders without having to pay. Each society is unique and can be inspired but gender empowerment is very important. 
Moving onto more controversial issues such as allegations that have been levelled by both Burundi and Congo against Rwanda. The US Senate FR Committee and UN Reports detail how the Burundi refugees are recruited from Rwandan camps to fight the Burundi Government, the expulsion of 1,500 refugees in 2016 and Burundi themselves expelling a Rwandan diplomat in 2015. With regards to DRC, the allegation is that Rwanda is paying ex M23 fighters to topple the Government. What are your views on these allegations, especially being the High Commissioner to a region that has border issues among themselves 
These are merely allegations and have no basis for them at all. We are looking at internal security and our own growth agenda. This is the preoccupation for us and and we have no issues with our neighbours. The region we find ourselves in is challenging since it is prone to conflict. Therefore our approach is that they should be addressed internally if they dont affect Rwanda. We have had challenges because of our history and remnants of genocide forces were roaming in from DRC but we worked with DRC to address that and to contain and minimise the problem. The country is stable now. We remain vigilant to secure borders and internal cohesion but we dont interfere in others politics. We are all members of the East African community and we are working towards regional integration. 
"It is a vibrant and fast growing relationship. Over the last few years, there has been an increased exchange in trade, education and the sharing of water management and irrigation skills"

But doesnt the spillover of refugees from Burundi make an issue for Rwanda as well 
This is a point of concern. The region should be stable because if one part is not it has an impact on the other. We have to deal with many refugees from Burundi and we have had to divert resources to resettle them, for the education of their children and for shelter and water. This is because we have been refugees ourselves so we make sure they are received well. This is a point of concern as it is a drain on the economy. Why I said it was internal was because the problem is internal in the governing dispute Burundi has. Our wish is that Burundi solves their problems quickly. 
Similar to post-conflict Sri Lanka, there are allegations of Human Rights violation in Rwanda. The US State Department has said they were concerned about the disappearances occurring, Reporters Without Borders ranks Rwanda as 161 in 2016 due to the risks the journalists face. Human Rights Watch has reported that the Government did not tolerate dissent and Amnesty International states that members of the opposition face a repressive environment. What are your thoughts on these allegations 
Rwanda went through a devastating genocide. What we have done over the last few years was to rebuild our country to benefit all Rwandans. We had a huge refugee crisis so we have had to focus on returning and reintegrating refugees. We worked on reconciliation to work out a peaceful process of life for our people to overcome the torment of their past. We had to build institutions for democracy. We have a new constitution guaranteeing rights and the per capita income has almost doubled. 
Allegations for a country in post conflict with an opposition abroad is not a new story to us. But it contradicts the reality of the country. It is a peaceful country that benefits every Rwandan. It is highly rated in governing reforms hence donors pour money into the country. They do this since we respect human rights, have democracy and have good governance. We have the least instances of corruption and have zero tolerance for pollution. For a small economy like ours to attract investment of the nature we do details of the positive story of Rwanda. 
Once again like Sri Lanka saw in 2015, the President of Rwanda has implemented constitutional changes, albeit through a referendum, that effectively allow him to stay in power till 2034 by running for a third term. Allies such as the US have asked him to step down to foster a new generation of leaders. President Kagame has said however that Rwanda did not need an eternal leader. How do these two facts coexist 
I dont know where 2034 comes from because there is no intention like that. The new constitution that has been adopted guarantees time limits. The reason for this change was not by the president at all but because a majority of Rwandans felt that this was the first time we had a leader who had a very clear vision where the country had to go. Rwanda is at a point where people feel that there is much more that can be done over the years and they want the pending programmes to be executed. So until they have total confidence that a new leader can come in and not take the country down the drain they want President Kagame. They demanded constitutional change and time limits would be maintained but there is a transitional period to maintain the current pace of development. The people did not want a sudden change as we have seen sudden changes retarding the development in neighbouring countries. This shows the maturity of the judgement of the people where you are not going to gamble with the future of a country by all of a sudden changing things. This had unanimous support and this was done democratically which involved a big debate around the country. 

"For us post-genocide reconciliation centred around opening up the country to the global community since part of the challenge we faced was being closed and inward looking. Therefore we decided to open and link up with other countries in order to be an active member in the international community"

Moving on to more positive aspects; in 1994, the growth rate was -11.4 but in 2015 it was +6.9. What is the success behind this 
It all started with leadership. The President in 2000 started with a brave vision and a timeline of 2020 to make Rwanda a mid-income country. We invested heavily in infrastructure, health, education, and IT and his plan was laid down very concretely. This gave us a clear sense of how public investment should be made. He also laid down the reforms for the country to be conducive for foreign investment. Poverty has reduced and overall productivity of the country has risen. This is all because of a clear vision which was rigorously pursued. Another important aspect was the fight against corruption. Corruption drains the country so that public resources are not used properly. This ensured confidence to foreigners. This has also helped us. 
One of the biggest lessons the post conflict Sri Lanka can learn from Rwanda is reconciliation. We appreciate your advice 
For us reconciliation was very essential. It was an existential matter for us since Rwandans killed fellow Rwandans and they were neighbours and would continue to live together. We cant build a country like that without bridging the gap. One idea to solve this was was Gacaca which was the communal way of justice through dialogue truth and punishment and forgiveness. We could do this based on the history of the country and traditional practices. This worked for us since it was built from a traditional model. 
Sri Lanka has a very long history and each society is unique in its own way. Therefore we could only get inspiration from one another. The South African Reconciliation Commission could not be used for Rwanda due to the differences. Within Sri Lanka, there are some values and traditions that should inspire the country. Sri Lanka has done very well in the immediate aftermath and to be where you are right now, and it is incredible so see the growth and the will of the people. We are very impressed with what the country has achieved and I see the future is very bright.  

"It is a peaceful country that benefits every Rwandan. It is highly rated in governing reforms hence donors pour money into the country.

Two powerful upcountry politicos at provincial level had distributed most hospital labourer appointments in the province to their political supporters.

Having done away with the proper recruitment procedure, these two political heavyweights had distributed 75 appointments each among their political supporters. Meanwhile, they had conceded a quota of two appointments each to the council members in a bid to prevent them from raising a hue and cry in protest.
A leading upcountry politician who condemned the manner in which the hospital labourer vacancies were filled said: This is a typical instance where those wielding the ladle generously serving themselves as the popular Sinhala proverb goes.

Hundreds of migrants rush border at Spains Ceuta
	

MADRID AFP Feb20, 2017 
Some 300 migrants stormed the border between Morocco and Spain at Ceuta on Monday, authorities said, days after hundreds more forced their way over the frontier. 
The young migrants climbed over the high border fence into the Spanish North African territory, ecstatic to have finally crossed into a European Union state. 
Their arrival comes just days after nearly 500 migrants made it over the fence on Friday, one of the biggest entries since the border barrier was reinforced in 2005. 
Ceuta and Melilla, also a Spanish territory in North Africa, have the EUs only land borders with Africa, so are entry points for migrants who either climb the border fence, swim along the coast or hide in vehicles. 
The enclave has been ringed by a double wire fence eight kilometres (five miles) long. The six-metre high fence also has rolls of barbed wire.

IPPBA says traffic fines adding up to 5000%
	
The Committee appointed by President Maithripala Sirisena on the Rs.25,000 fine for seven traffic in its report stated that the fines should been increased to a total of up to 5,000 per cent, Inter Provincial Private Bus Association (IPPBA) President Sarath Vijitha Kumara said today.
He told the media that if the committee recommendations were adopted by the Government, all the private bus associations, including other transport services would resort to a countrywide work stoppage like on December 2 last year.
We will not allow even an increase Rs.100 without discussions with the transport sector stakeholders. The report has recommended an increase of up to 5,000 per cent with the minimum fine of Rs.20 being increased to Rs.1000, Mr. Kumara said. The Rs.25,000 fine has been increased to Rs.30,000 and could go up to Rs.150,000 including a jail term of up to ten years if the Court decides. The Government has not thought of the monthly or the daily income of a driver."
He said if a driver was sentenced to jail for a minimum of three months his family would be deprived of any income.
"The Government has not considered the people but is more concerned about revenue generated to the Treasury. According to the recommendation, fines will be increased in percentages of 500, 1000, 1,500 and 5,000. The committee has not consulted any one nor has it done any preliminary investigation on Government taxes or the income of the people concerned, Mr. Kumara said. "Fines should be increased in a systematic manner. For more than 15 years the fines had not been adjusted. It is fare to impose fines if the Government provided suitable infrastructure facilities on roads as well. Therefore the committee recommendation report on fines for those seven traffic offences should be rejected." (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Melbourne plane crash: Five killed as aircraft hits shopping centre
	
Five people have died after a light plane crashed into a shopping centre in Melbourne, Australia.
The charter flight appeared to have had a "catastrophic engine failure" shortly after taking off from the small Essendon Airport, said Victoria Police Assistant Commissioner Stephen Leane.
Everyone on board is believed dead.
"At this stage the advice we have is there are no fatalities other than on the aircraft itself," said the commissioner.
"Looking at the fireball, it is incredibly lucky that no-one was at the back of those stores or in the car park of the stores, that no one was even hurt."
The shopping centre was not open to the public at the time.
"Today is a desperately sad day," Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said.
"A number of people have died as a result of what is the worst civil aviation accident that our state has seen for 30 years."
A spokeswoman for Spotlight, a retailer in the complex, said the plane crashed into its rear warehouse but all staff were safe.
Essendon Airport, mostly used by light planes, is about 13km (8 miles) north-west of central Melbourne.
Damage at scene
The Australian Transport Safety Bureau said it would investigate how the twin-engine Beechcraft B200 King Air crashed soon after 09:00 local time on Tuesday (22:00 GMT Monday).
Footage broadcast on local media showed fire and black smoke at the wreckage.
"Immediately I could tell it was something horrific, the explosion would have gone 30m [100ft] high and ballooned upwards in red and black," witness Mikey Cahill told the Herald Sun.
Another witness, Daniel May, said he was waiting for the shopping centre to open when the plane came down.
"There was an orange explosion and then smoke," he told The Age. "Emergency crews rushed very quickly in, soon after, and I left the area."
Police said they were evacuating the area and a nearby freeway was closed in both directions.
King Island, popular for its beaches and dairy farms, lies 245km (150 miles) south of Melbourne in Bass Strait. (BBC)

Minor parties want LG polls under PR system
	
Minor parties supporting the government had told Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe that the local government elections should be held according to the Proportional Representation (PR) system.
The leaders of these parties, including the Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA), the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC), the All Ceylon Muslim Congress (ACMC), the Eelam Peoples Democratic Party (EPDP), the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and the United Socialist Party (USP) had said so when they met the prime minister at Temple Trees last evening.
One of the party leaders told Daily Mirror that they said they were not in favour of the proposed new system, under which 30 percent of the local government members would be elected according to the PR system and 70 percent according to the ward system. They had said the minor parties would not gain anything if the elections were held according to the new system and they would not contest if the elections were held according to the new system.
This party leader said they had also told him they would contest separately even under the PR system.
Mr Wickremeisnghe had then told the party leaders that he would have to discuss the matter with the President before agreeing to anything.
Ministers Mano Ganesan and Rauff Hakeem, MPs Douglas Devananda and M A Sumanthiran, and United Socialist Party leader Siritunga Jayasuriya had participated in the meeting. The leaders of the other minority parties had been in contact with those at the meeting though they were not present.
The party leaders had also met the Indian Foreign Secretary S Jayasankar and discussed several issues concerning the minorities, including education, health and housing and how India could assist Sri Lanka in these sectors. (Yohan Perera)

REUTERS: Rania Nashar was named chief executive of Samba Financial Group on Monday, becoming the first female CEO of a listed Saudi commercial bank in line with the governments economic and social reforms.
Nashar is a board member of Sambas global markets subsidiary and a Pakistani unit, and has nearly 20 years of experience in banking.
Women, banned from driving in Saudi Arabia and subject to a system of male guardianship, hold few top posts in the financial sector.
But reforms which Saudi Arabia launched last year to make the economy more efficient and less reliant on oil exports include boosting the role of women in the economy.
The Saudi Stock Exchange last week appointed its first female chair, Sarah al-Suhaimi, who became the first female chief executive of a Saudi investment bank when she took the helm of NCB Capital in 2014.
The kingdoms top sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund, holds stakes in major companies and is at the centre of restructuring the economy. It is hiring Saudi women to help manage its assets, sources familiar with its operations said.
Saudi Arabias reform plans aim to have women account for 30 percent of the workforce in coming years, up from the current 22 percent.
Samba is Saudi Arabias third-largest bank by assets.

Pan Asia Banks solar loan scheme- ideal way to get zero cost electricity
	
Pan Asia Banks solar loan scheme provides financing to customers to purchase solar energy systems, enabling them to generate their own electricity and be free from electricity bills and contribute to reduce global warming.
Solar Energy Systems allow customers to install solar panels on the roof and generate electricity from solar power. Electricity generated in this manner is used for household consumption and the excess power will be released to the main electricity grid for which the customer will receive credits from CEB/LECO. These credits can be set off against the electricity that is consumed from the main grid, enabling the household to enjoy electricity without having to pay electricity bills.
Pan Asia Banks solar loans are offered at a special interest rate with a repayment period up to 7 years. Another unique benefit of solar loan scheme is that, guarantors are not required for professionals such as doctors, engineers, and accountants etc. Under this loan scheme, a customer can obtain a credit facility up to Rs.3 million and jointly apply with his/ her spouse or a child.
Some of the main customer benefits of this product offering are as follows;
 Customers electricity bills can be reduced to zero, as each household could generate more electricity than the consumption (depending on the capacity of the unit)
 After the loan is paid off, customers can enjoy electricity at zero cost
 Customers can increase utilization of their electrical goods without being concerned about electricity cost
 Environmentally-friendly
The main idea behind introduction of this product since 2014 is to make this technology accessible and affordable to a larger segment of households in the country, so that in todays world of growing energy costs and increasing environmental concerns, a viable alternative solution to the use of fossil fuel is made available. Pan Asia Bank with a track record of embracing and introducing innovative and green banking products, continues to be a catalyst in encouraging the transition of Sri Lanka to a greener economy through this loan and other green economic activities such as renewable energy and energy saving projects.
In addition to the fact that these activities are in line with the banks CSR vision, the Bank is confident that they will create a perfect opportunity to generate long term sustainable economic benefits to uplift the living standards of people by creating cost effective energy for businesses and employment in a socially & environmentally responsible manner.
These green initiatives will also result in many strategic economic benefits to the country as development of renewable energy sources such as Solar Energy, Wind Power and Biomass etc. would reduce Sri Lankas vulnerability to global oil price volatilities and its contribution to Global Warming.

The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) said today the Ven. Athureliya Rathana Thera had reportedly met the United National Party (UNP) Leader to discuss joining the party in violation of the MoU signed between the JHU and the UNP in 2015.
JHU Co-Chairman the Ven. Hedigalle Wimalasara Thera said Rathana Thera had no right to join the UNP for the simple reason that he entered Parliament through the single slot allocated to the JHU in the national list as one of the conditions of the MoU.
According to the MoU, any decision on the slots allocated in the national list can only be taken by the respective parties and as such only the JHU can decide on matters regarding its slot on the national list, the Thera said.
Wimalasara Thera said the JHU was ready to take Rathana Thera back to the JHU if he recanted his decision to act independently in parliament.
Ven. Rathana Thera should withdraw his decision and work with the JHU. He cannot join the President or the Prime Minister as laid down in the MoU. Rathana Thera is trying to win the favour of the UNP and the President by participating at events attended by the President. This is no way will divert or dilute the disciplinary action against him, Wimalasara Thera said.
He said a committee headed by him was appointed by the JHU Central Committee to take disciplinary action against Rathana Thera and that the investigations had already begun. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Rich inmates are windfalls for him
	

There is a bigwig of a certain state-run lodge for whom admitting a prominent politician or a well- heeled shady character like a drug baron amounts to winning a big lottery prize, they say.

The fees he charges for providing comforts to such filthy-rich inmates amount to several millions. By the way, a bank cash deposit slip found on the person of a heroin trafficker frisked after being arrested by narcotics sleuths had revealed that a sum of Rs.2 million had been credited to the account of the bigwig in question.
All staffers of the state-run lodge from the top to the bottom are well aware of the doings of the bigwig, but high-ups of lesser ranks look the other way as the boss is sharing his ill-gotten exploits with them and those in low ranks prefer to pretend ignorance for fear of reprisals, they say.

## Title: Russia to deliver another contingent of arms to Sri Lanka  - Russian Ambassador
## Section: News Features

Russia to deliver another contingent of arms to Sri Lanka  - Russian Ambassador
	
Russian Ambassador Alexander A. Karchava, in an interview with the Daily Mirror underscores the importance of his countrys relationship with Sri Lanka, the potential areas for future cooperation and the new global developments.
Excerpts:
"I am here for four and half years. During my time, we delivered a batch of helicopters. We are negotiating another delivery of certain armaments. After the war, we helped and also provided special equipment for demining. I must say that with the help of these equipment and Russian experts help, Sri Lanka managed successfully to demine vast areas of each territory in quite a short time."

Q How do you analyse the evolution of Russia-Sri Lanka relations over the decades
The 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations shows that our relations are quite seasoned and grown up. Sixty years in the life of a person is quite a period. Sri Lanka is quite young as an independent State. Your country is just 70. Our diplomatic relations are 60 years old. To tell you the truth, it is much deeper because, in the 19th century, we opened a consulate here. Even before Sri Lanka became independent, this lovely island was visited by several famous Russian representatives.
Among them are popular writers and authors such as Anton Chekhov. Also, Sri Lanka was visited by another great Russian writer Ivan Bunin, who received Noble Prize for Literature. In 1981, Sri Lanka was visited by then Crown Prince of Russian empire Nikolai II the last Russian emperor. During his visit, he planted a tree. You can see it grown big at the Peradeniya Botanical Gardens. Our relationship was a road with two-way traffic. We try to help Sri Lanka in many ways, politically and economically.
Our military technical cooperation has a quite sizeable share in the whole context of relationship because we were delivering some armaments to Sri Lanka during the Soviet Union time and after that. I am here for four and half years. During my time, we delivered a batch of helicopters. We are negotiating another delivery of certain armaments.
After the war, we helped and also provided special equipment for demining.
I must say that with the help of these equipment and Russian experts help, Sri Lanka managed successfully to demine vast areas of each territory in quite a short time.
I can bring another opposite example. That is the war in Cambodia. The war ended more than 40 years ago. For a long period of time, this country was nicknamed as killing field because of the live land mines. But, Sri Lanka managed its problem with the help of Russian experts and equipment. Of course, a great share of our relationship belongs to education. So many young Sri Lankans have received their education in my country. May be, around 3,000 graduates, who received their higher education in Russia work here now. What is special is our medical education. Many of those are successful not only in medicine. For instance, the present Ambassador to Russia Dr. Saman Weerasinghe is a medical doctor. He became a successful businessman and now he represents Sri Lanka as the ambassador.
Sri Lanka is one of the gems of South Asia, a crowned gem. Of course, Sri Lanka is very popular with Russian tourists. In the period of my presence here, the number of Russian tourists grew three fold. Now, we have about 70,000 Russian tourists per year. It was only 22,000 earlier. We also cooperate in other fields. In 2016, we signed bilateral protocol on cooperation in the exploration of a nuclear energy for peaceful development. Sri Lanka is now a partner of Russia in this field. We can help you to build nuclear power plants and power stations here.
Q How far have you progressed in this field
Actually, the document has been signed. No actual project has started yet. I think it is the time to think about it. Of course, after Fukushima tragedy, there is a big question mark. I can tell you that Russian experience in providing security and danger-free use is enormous. We ourselves suffered the Chernobyl tragedy more than 30 years ago.
We know now what to do, how to protect such installations. Russian experience is very unique. You can trust it. Also, we helped Sri Lanka politically during the period when your Republic was somewhat victim of a very politicised resolution concerning human rights. We always try to help you. We supported you in the UN fora. Sri Lanka is our trusted friend and partner in the international fora.
Q You mentioned that Russia is planning to deliver some armaments. What are they
I think you can get more details from the Ministry of Defence. But, I can tell you that the Russian armaments meet designs for airports, sea or land. They are very reliable, of very high quality and value for money. In my knowledge, they are practically unbeatable. For instance, I know that you will be participating in peace keeping operations in Mali.
I think we can help equip your contingent with all necessary arms and so on.
Q How has Russia-Sri Lanka relations evolved after the new Government assumed office in Sri Lanka
I see changes in personalities, not in friends. Friends are the same. We see the new Government as the choice of Sri Lankan people. We respect this choice. We view the choice and the result of the free expression of this by Sri Lankan people.

"In the United States, there is a well-developed, seasoned system of checks and balances. It is not totally correct to say that the new President means new policy. In any case, the new President has to follow the policies and interests of the whole country. "

Q Sri Lanka voted against Russias resolution against the extension of staff benefits to the same sex couples at the UN once. Were you offended by it
We were not offended. We just noted. Of course, every country has a certain choice, and is free to make it.
Q Russia has been Sri Lankas traditional tea buyer. How is the tea market now
Well, due to certain difficulties in the Russian economy, the exchange rate for Russian Ruble is different now.
When I came here, the rate was one Ruble for four rupees. It is now only two rupees.
Now, tea traders of Sri Lanka make less profit as a result. Still, the business is not that bad. Recently, Sri Lankan Plantation Minister Navin Dissanayake just visited Russia. You can check with him. Of course, it is not as profitable as before. Still, Ceylon Tea is extremely popular in Russia. Many Russians consume a lot of Ceylon Tea.
Q How does Russia view Sri Lankas strategic location in the Indian Ocean, especially in the context of countries such as China, India and the United States harbouring their interests
We always recognise the very strategic position of Sri Lanka. But, we never exert our individual interests here from this point of view. Of course, you have excellent ports both in the south and the north east in Trincomalee. Trincomalee is an excellent port. Russian ships are frequent guests here. During my time, for instance, there were ten port calls.
But, I underline we never try to seek advantages from our national point of view here. We are not that egoistic to seek something for ourselves. You are our partner. Our cooperation is quite strong. We are very friendly. We never seek any position for certain military installation or whatsoever. In your relation with other countries- China, the US and India as you named  it is your own choice. People and the Government of Sri Lanka have to decide.
Q How do you look forward to the visit of President Maithripala Sirisena to your country
We are looking forward because you know President Sirisena and our President Vladimir Putin had a very good meeting last October in Goa. There was BRICS summit hosted by India. This opportunity was used to invite BIMSTEC countries. Sri Lanka was there. Our friend and your President had a good chance to meet. After that, I met President Sirisena two or three times. He told me personally that he had a very good meeting. And, he was very happy to be in conversation with my President. President Sirisena is quite keen to visit Russia. Now, we are working actively to realise this visit and make it a substantive one. We learn that such summit definitely give another tangible impetus to the whole context of our bilateral relations. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa visited Russia as well.
It was not an official visit. It was a participation in an international event in Russia. The last official State visit was made by former Prime Minister the late Sirimavo Bandaranaike.


"Udayanga was Sri Lankan Ambassador to Russia. Then, he was recalled. He left Russia. He is not hiding in Russia. How could we help In what sense There was some information from time to time appearing in the media here that there is some suspicion that the former Ambassador was somehow involved with the killing of a Sri Lankan in Russia in 2014"

Q During the last Government, there were moves by leading Russian Gazprom to invest in Sri Lanka in oil exploration. How is the progress
Gazprom is coming from time to time. They are cautious. They are studying certain feasibilities at two blocks for exploration. Sri Lanka is quite keen to invite Gazprom for more activities. They are really cautious, though. While I am here, they visited three times.
Q Apart from this, how does Russia view the role of the UN and the UNHRC
In a nutshell, the UN is a universal instrument of international relations. But, the UN, as an organisation, was not created to make this world a political heaven. It was created not to lead this world to become a political hell. There is a certain difference. You cannot think that with the help of the UN regulations and movements, you can create a heaven. But, with the help of this universal instrument, you can prevent this world from becoming a hell. Sometimes, you stop wars, reduce troops and stop fire. Another thing is the UN was created after the World War II.
The structure and design reflected the situation of the world in those days. The world has changed. It is changing rapidly. We do think these international bodies need certain reforms. But, of course, the interests of the larger world players should be protected and provided. Many countries have reached that level, for instance, our partners in BRICS such as India
and Brazil.
In Europe, Germany has become very advanced. It is one of the leaders economically and politically in Europe. We have to think how to accommodate these big countries in a new design. We are for certain reformation. We are not going to pull it down to create a new one.
We have to keep traditions, basic principles of the charter of this universal mechanism.

"Now, tea traders of Sri Lanka make less profit as a result. Still, the business is not that bad. Recently, Sri Lankan Plantation Minister Navin Dissanayake just visited Russia. You can check with him. Of course, it is not as profitable as before. Still, Ceylon Tea is extremely popular in Russia. Many Russians consume a lot of Ceylon Tea."

Q In Europe, there is rising nationalism. Alongside, there is opposition to integration with the European Union. How does Russia observe
We are closely watching. It could create a new situation, of course. To my mind, no one can predict what would be this situation. We are watching the processes to understand how our interests could be secured in these environments politically and economically. For instance, if we are dealing with the EU, there are basic principles to follow in doing business with each member state.
Now, if the United Kingdom is pulling out, they will introduce new regulations for business. We must somehow adjust our economic relations to that situation. We are closely watching and monitoring the process to determine our approach, standards and actions.
Q In your view, how will the new world order be in the context of the United States of America having a new President, who has a different worldview
To my mind, at the end of the 19th century, there was such a phenomenon concerning the United States. It is gold rush. What we are seeing today is Trumps rush which is not totally correct. The President of the United States is not a king. He is not a monarch. He is not the only person running the whole country. He cannot personally pursue or realise his interests.
In the United States, there is a well-developed, seasoned system of checks and balances. It is not totally correct to say that the new President means new policy. In any case, the new President has to follow the policies and interests of the whole country. Do you think the whole country helps the implementation of the new policy
Q There is legal action initiated against Sri Lankas former Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga, locally. Has the government of Sri Lanka reach you for help in the arrest of him
No, why should it approach us Udayanga was Sri Lankan Ambassador to Russia. Then, he was recalled. He left Russia. He is not hiding in Russia. How could we help In what sense There was some information from time to time appearing in the media here that there is some suspicion that the former Ambassador was somehow involved with the killing of a Sri Lankan in Russia in 2014.
There were some allegations that he was involved in the crime. This is totally false information. The person responsible for the demise of this poor Sri Lankan is a Russian. He is sentenced in Russia. I requested for documents proving it. They are in my office now. The case was seriously investigated. The culprit was found and arrested. He was tried.
Q What are the new potential areas for cooperation between the two countries
I think energy, science and technology. Sri Lankan Minister Susil Premajayantha is very active in this regard. He has proposed a whole programme.

"No, why should it approach us Udayanga was Sri Lankan Ambassador to Russia. Then, he was recalled. He left Russia. He is not hiding in Russia. How could we help In what sense There was some information from time to time appearing in the media here that there is some suspicion that the former Ambassador was somehow involved with the killing of a Sri Lankan in Russia in 2014"

When the matter was taken up, Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Rajaratnam told courts that the Respondent was present before the Bribery Commission on February 15 as per the undertaking given to court and submitted an affidavit to affirm the fact.
He further submitted that investigations are not yet concluded and filed a further affidavit to inform court that he was required for further investigations. He told Court that MP Namal was required to be present before the Bribery Commission for further questioning on March 27.
He brought to the notice of the Court that while he had not received instructions from the Bribery Commission about what had transpired there, he would leave the matter in the hands of the Court.
In view of the submissions made by the Additional Solicitor General, the Court was of the view that Respondent had failed to appear before the Commission on May 26, 2016 and thereby jeopardized law and order. (S.S.Selvanayagam)

SL failed to end Police abuse: HRW
	
The Sri Lankan government has not met its pledge to curtail police abuses prior to the March 2017 session of the United Nations Human Rights Council, the Human Rights Watch (HRW) said yesterday.
Issuing a statement, the HRW said security sector reform was one of 25 undertakings by Sri Lanka in the Human Rights Council resolution adopted by consensus in October 2015.
It said the Sri Lankan government has failed to repeal the abusive Prevention of Terrorism Act or take serious measures to reduce torture in custody.
Its crucial that the Human Rights Council consider closely whether Sri Lanka made progress in the security sector as well as its other commitments such as transitional justice. Nearly 18 months after making important promises to the council, Sri Lankas leaders appear to be backtracking on key human rights issues, including reforming the police, said HRW Asia director Brad Adams.
Reform of the security sector has lagged behind action on the council resolutions four pillars of transitional justice: accountability, the disappeared, truth-seeking, and reconciliation.
A recent report from the UN Special Rapporteur on torture, Juan Mendez, highlighted the ongoing culture of torture in Sri Lanka.
A 2015 report by HRW also found that Sri Lankans routinely face torture and other ill-treatment by the police. In the vast majority of cases, the victims were unable to obtain any meaningful redress, the statement said.
The government has yet to repeal the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), which has been used to arbitrarily detain terrorism suspects and others without charge for years. During the countrys 26-year-long civil war, the government asserted that the PTA was a necessary tool in its battle against the LTTE. Yet, nearly eight years after the wars end in May 2009, the PTA not only remains on the books but continues to be used to arrest and detain people, it said.
The upcoming Human Rights Council session provides an important opportunity for UN member countries to closely examine the Special Rapporteur on tortures report and the problem of torture and other police abuse in Sri Lanka. They should press the government to address these concerns as part of the overall reform efforts underway under the Human Rights Council resolution.
The Mendez report on torture maps out a detailed reform proposal that the Sri Lankan government should embrace and implement, Adams said. The Human Rights Council can rev up this process by addressing torture and police reform in its review of Sri Lankas compliance with the councils resolution, the statement said.

They weighed their worth in gold
	

During the debate sessions in the august assembly, some members would meet in a quiet corner to enjoy a chit-chat. What they usually talked about are matters pertaining to their private life.

The other day a young state purohita from the central hills and a fair and lovely member were seen engaged in an intimate conversation in the chamber while a debate was on in full steam. Despite being from opposite sides of the divide the duo are said to be thick chums and would often meet for a chat, they say.
During the lengthy chat, they chanced upon the subject of the high price of gold. The state purohita claimed that the ring he was wearing weighed two pounds.
The fair member immediately contested this statement. Even a bangle wouldnt weigh that much.
Just weigh it on your palm if you think that I am lying, the state purohita said extending the ring that he hurriedly pulled off the finger.
You are right! It weighs even more than two pounds!, the fair member conceded after giving the ring several tosses on her palm.
As for us, we cannot afford to use so much of gold! she added in a voice tinged with a trace of sadness, they say.

A day after falsely suggesting there was an immigration-related security incident in Sweden, President Donald Trump said on Sunday his comment was based on a television report he had seen. 
Trump told a rally on Saturday that Sweden was having serious problems with immigrants. 
You look at whats happening last night in Sweden, Trump said. Sweden. Who would believe this Sweden. They took in large numbers. Theyre having problems like they never thought possible. 
No incident occurred in Sweden and the countrys baffled government asked the U.S. State Department to explain. 
Swedens crime rate has fallen since 2005, official statistics show, even as it has taken in hundreds of thousands of immigrants from war-torn countries like Syria and Iraq. 
Trumps comment confounded Stockholm. We are trying to get clarity, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Catarina Axelsson said.

(Daily Mail, London), 20.02.2017 - India never asked Britain for hundreds of millions of pounds in foreign aid and doesnt even need it, the countrys new High Commissioner to the UK Y.K. Sinha told the Sunday Express. 
Britain sent India 279 million in 2014 alone  despite the fact the country has its own space programme and is planning to spend 10 billion on a fleet of warships.Plans are in place to give India a further 130million in technical assistance by 2018. But Y.K. Sinha said the foreign aid deal is becoming a thing of the past and that the future priority should be getting a good trade deal sorted out. 
Mr Sinha added: While I dont want to prejudge British aid that has been given, or will be given, easier access to British markets, easier movement of people and the transfer of technology are more important he told the Sunday Express. 
We are grateful for any assistance we received in the past or will get in the future. But if it suddenly stopped would it make a huge difference No. Did anyone in the government of India ask for assistance No.

Where phenomenal performers take centre stage
	
Seventh Guitar Fest of SL Guitar Association
The seventh guitar festival held by the Guitar Association of Sri Lanka was an improvement on the previous year, when this popular event which brings together guitarists and other musicians from this country and abroad seemed to lack direction and tottering due to internal disputes within the association. 
Despite the loss of its flamenco guitar component, principal organiser Mohammad Iqbal has evidently been able to put together a colourful and varied performance this time. The festival was held at six different venues, from Colombo to Kandy, Badulla and Jaffna, from January 21 onwards. 
That evening at the Russian Centre in Colombo, fans were treated to a different spectacle. Usually, Guitar Fest performers come casually dressed, the flamenco-attired musicians from the University of Performing Arts being the exception. This time, at least three groups of very young musicians came splendidly attired in cowboy outfits and played a joyful combination of guitar, violin, cello and drums, evoking the heady music of the Shadows era as well as Sri Lankas golden age of pop as exemplified by pop bands including the Golden Chimes. These energetic musicians have been trained and nurtured by Rohan de Silva, Wickrema Palliyamulla and Sumith Liyanage. 
Also dressed like a true performing artiste was young singer-guitarist K. P. Thilangi, who made a dazzling debut at last years Guitar Fest. She can not only look like a diva but sing like one too. A classical guitarist, she followed up a rendition of Asturias by Isaac Albenez with her own song, written by her sister in honour of the guitar. She has an impressive vocal range which brings to mind a blues singer, and was ably backed by a family band which includes father K. P. Thilakaratne playing the Accordion, with her mother and husband playing percussion instruments. 
Japanese classical guitarist Ken Gonzo Sugamata is now a regular performer at the fest. The chubby, cheerful, classical guitarist performed his trademark sing along track involving the audience, followed by a mellifluous rendition of Brazilian guitar music. 

"They played folk tunes which provided an interesting interlude in a programme otherwise geared to mainstream music, be it classical or pop"

Aditya Gandhi, a young Indian classical guitarist trained in the U.S., impressed the audience with his performance that included contemporary original compositions, particularly Africa, an instrumental piece with haunting, evocative melody lines. Unlike some artistes, Aditya is quite articulate and able to communicate his ideas to the audience. 
While there was less classical guitar than usual, the electric guitar component was exciting with veteran heavy metal guitarist Andrew Obeysekara impressing with his virtuoso vibrato playing. Zion de Silva was a new face, blending rock, funk and heavy metal with aplomb. Saeed from the Maldives was another spirited performer who played several pieces including his own compositions with gusto, though his four pieces sounded a bit repetitive towards the end. 
An interesting new feature was provided by a duo of young musicians from Jaffna  Athputhan playing banjo and Bismarck playing udukee, a traditional percussion instrument. They played folk tunes which provided an interesting interlude in a programme otherwise geared to mainstream music, be it classical or pop. 

Mohamed Iqbal and his wife Gayathri Gananathapillai are regular performers at each guitar fest. Iqbal composes and sings his own songs, and this time he performed one he had written about national hero Keppetipola Disawe, first performed by him several years ago. Gayathri is a pan flute player and backs him with that instrument. 
Guitar Fest is an entirely voluntary effort and entry this time was free of charge as it has always been. As Aditya Gandhi noted at the events conclusion, people have the impression that music is moved worldwide by recording companies and industry giants. But the truth is that major contributions are made towards that end by individuals like Mohamed Iqbal. While many people and institutions contribute to make Guitar Fest a reality (this time, the Department of Cultural Affairs and the Indian Cultural Centre contributed), it is no exaggeration to say that without Iqbal, there would be no Guitar Fest.

Wont press for merger of North, East: India
	
India will not be pressing Sri Lanka to merge the Northern and Eastern Provinces to form a single Tamil-majority, as envisaged by the India-Sri Lanka Accord of 1987, the visiting Indian Foreign Secretary S. Jaishankar has told the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) on Monday.
According to the Indian Express, the Foreign Secretary was reacting to a demand made by the leader of the Eelam Peoples Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) Suresh Premachandran, that India should honor its promise to keep the North and East united.
It had even said that it would not allow a referendum to be held on the issue.
Jaishankar has told Premachandran that much water has flown down the bridge since 1987 and as the situation has changed it will be better for all concerned to make use of the various windows of opportunity which have opened up recently with the change of regime and secure the rights of the Tamils.
He argued that it would not be wise to hold every other matter hostage to one issue - the merger of the North and East.
However, he added that India would not mind if the Tamils kept the issue alive and kept it on the table for talks with the Sri Lankan government.
Premachandran had highlighted the issue of the merger of the North and East partly because it had been the main theme of the Ezhuga Tamil rally held recently in the Eastern town of Batticaloa.
He pointed out that India has a moral responsibility to ask the Sri Lankan government to re-merge the North and East as it is part of the India-Sri Lanka Accord of 1987. If the Accord is still valid, every part of it should be deemed to be equally valid and implemented, he argued.
He recalled that former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had solemnly promised that the merger would remain and that the proposed referendum would not be held.
He also recalled that the EPRLF had fully cooperated with India on the implementation of the Accord, and like the Indian Peace Keeping Force, had lost many men in the fight against the LTTE which opposed the Accord.
India has a moral responsibility to keep its promise and persuade the Sri Lankan government to re-merge the North and East, Premachandran has said.

Yungang grottoes - Buddhist cave art in China
	
BY R. Jinith de Silva,
Senior Researcher of Xining Institute of City Diplomacy, China.
It is believed that Buddhism reached China through the Silk Route around first century A D, and subsequently all forms of art and craft arrived there from countries like India, Nepal and Sri Lanka. A tacit example for this would be the paintings found in grottoes built along the Silk Route in China. Mogao, Longmen and Yungang are the three most important places in China where Buddhist grottoes are found. The most famous and beautiful among them are the grottoes found in Yungang, built in fifth century AD. I had the privilege of witnessing these historical masterpieces last August. 
Yungang is situated in the old Kingdom of Datong. In the slopes of Yungang mountains is a beehive of grottoes, about 1km long. There are 45 main grottoes and more than 100 Buddha Statues.
Buddhist prelate Tan Yao who lived here was instrumental in the construction of grottoes. He had received the patronage of 54 merchants who engaged in trade along the Silk Route -- this was confirmed by an inscription found at the location (it was the oldest and most elaborated record about the building of Yungang grottoes). Moreover, the characters are top rated calligraphic works.
According to history, monk Tan Yao was in-charge of cutting five caves in the Western suburbs of State Wu. While they are referred to as the five caves of Tan Yao, they were built during the Northern Wei dynasty (460-471 AD). As a mark of respect to the prelate, a statue was erected at the entrance of the historical site. Other major caves had been mostly completed in the 18th year of the Northern Wei dynasty (494 AD). Kings like Emperor Xianowen who then ruled the dynasty had greatly supported this cause. 

It is believed that more than a staggering 40,000 craftsmen toiled to put up the grottoes and statues -- most of the statues were built according to the Gandarwa tradition of India. I was indeed surprised when my coordinator Chen Luying of Foreign and Overseas Affairs in the Shanxi Province told me some of these statues were from Sri Lanka. In the history books of China, Sri Lanka is referred to as the Kingdom of Lions. The arts and crafts that flowed to China through the Silk Route mixed with the natives that existed in China and obtained its present form. That could be found in Yungang grottoes today.

"The Buddha Statue found in cave number 12 is Thirteen metres in height and is valued for being a true representative of Yungang grotto arts. It reminds me of the Samadhi statue at Mahamevuna Uyana in Anuradhapura"

The terrain divides the grottoes on the hill into three natural but neat clusters; the East, Central and West. Caves in the East are mostly house pagodas called Papoda caves, while the caves in the central area have front and rear chambers with main Buddha figures sitting in the middle and relives carved on the ceiling and walls. Whereas the caves in the West are smaller.
This place is in fact a treasure house of Buddhist artwork, sculptures, statues and murals of Gods and Goddesses, birds and animals, beautiful flowers and exotic plants as well as images of those who sponsored the building of grottoes.
Extremely beautiful Buddha statues could be found in some of these grottoes, and the tallest of them is about 16 metres. They express love and compassion.
The Buddha Statue found in cave number 12 is Thirteen metres in height and is valued for being a true representative of Yungang grotto arts. It reminds me of the Samadhi statue at Mahamevuna Uyana in Anuradhapura.

It is however recorded that in the 5th century, the then emperors and their immediate families have had private temples. Some of the statues in these temples portrayed different stages of Buddhas life -- some portrayed the Buddha preaching and ladies spraying flowers from heaven.
In cave number 20, dancers and musicians portray Buddhas ascendance to Buddhahood. These statues are beautifully sculptured and the dresses in them resemble what the people wore during that time.
Further, Yungang grottoes become a turning point of the development of Buddhist art in China. The statues of Dunhuang Mogao and Longmen were both influenced by Yungang grottoes that have the largest collection of grotto artworks in China. The site was inscribed on the UNESCO list of world natural heritage in 2001.
