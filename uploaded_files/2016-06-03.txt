Elephant calf found in uncovered drain, recovering well: Veterinary surgeon
	
The four-month-old female elephant, who made the news after it was rescued from an uncovered drain situated close to the entrance to the Hambantota Port, is recovering well from an injury to one of its legs, Udawalawa Elephant Transit Home?s Veterinary Surgeon Dr. Vijitha Perera said yesterday.
He said elephant calves were usually kept at the elephant transit home for about five years before they were released to the wild following rehabilitation.
However, in this particular case, they had decided to release the baby calf as soon as it fully recovered since her mother would be roaming the area in search of her.
Meanwhile officials from the Department of Wildlife said they were looking for the elephant herd to which the calf that was injured belonged in order to release her to them when it had fully recovered.
Wildlife officials said that the human-elephant conflict in Hambantota had aggravated as the forest cover which provides shelter to the elephants was fast diminishing as man engaged in an aggressive development drive in the area.?There is a risk to homes and human lives as a result of this conflict,? they said.
The elephant calf was rescued by Wildlife officials amidst protests from the calf's mother, in a 5-hour-long rescue operation on Sunday (29). She was brought to the Transit Home with a broken leg and was being treated. (Roshan Gunasekara)

Financial support for LTTE continues: US
	
Despite the LTTE?s military defeat by the Sri Lankan government in 2009, the terrorist group?s international network of sympathizers and financial support continues, the US State Department said.
The Country Reports on Terrorism issued by the US State Department said LTTE?s financial network of support had continued operations in 2015.
?The group used its international contacts and the large Tamil diaspora in North America, Europe, and Asia to procure weapons, communications, funds and other needed supplies. The group employed charities as fronts to collect and divert funds for its activities,? the report said.
It said there had been no known attacks in Sri Lanka that could verifiably be attributed to the LTTE since the end of the war but a total of 13 LTTE supporters, several of whom had allegedly planned attacks against the US and Israeli diplomatic facilities in India were arrested in Malaysia in 2014.
?Additional LTTE members were arrested in Malaysia and India in 2015, one of whom was accused of exhorting other Sri Lankans to fund and revive the LTTE,? it said.
Referring to countering violent extremism, the report said Sri Lanka continued to operate a one-year long rehabilitation program for former alleged LTTE combatants, participation in which was mandatory for a majority of the prisoners formerly held under the PTA who were released on bail.

Importer of suspicious cargo fined Rs.65 Mn
	
An importer found guilty of importing disassembled vehicles in a container claiming it was machinery was fined Rs.65 million by Customs, Director General Chulananda Perera said today.
?The 40-foot container was imported on the ?Ebba Maersk? vessel on May 2 and taken into custody on May 6 by the customs and the Customs Revenue Task Force (RTF),? he said.
The container had been imported by Japan Lanka Enterprises private company in Thihagoda Matara by an importer who had been identified as a Southern Province Basnayake Nilame. He had paid Customs duty of Rs. 362,501 to have the goods released.
?When the container was to be inspected, the importer had made an appeal to the Director General of Customs requesting him to conduct this examination at their Matara stores complex as the movement of the cargo will damage the machinery and the container,? Mr. Perera said.
After considering the request made to the Customs Director, the containers were examined under the supervision of three senior RTF officers.
?The examination revealed that the container had several disassembled vehicles inside in addition to the items declared by the importer to the Customs,? the Director General said.
The Customs investigation was carried out on the instructions of Customs Director General Chulananda Perera.
The importer was fined three times the value of the cargo. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe slammed Government MP Chatura Senaratne for his disparaging verbal criticism of the Government Medical Officers? Association (GMOA).
MP Senaratne, the son of Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, launched a verbal attack against some GMOA members even calling them ?Gevala Yakas? (House Ghosts).
Minister Rajapakshe said it was unbecoming of an MP to slander medical professionals in this manner, and called it despicable.
?It is a dignified profession everyone should respect. We, the government, do not condone this behaviour of the MP. The government is for a close rapport with medical professionals though there are ideological differences with the GMOA,? he said. (Kelum Bandara)

Lankan refugees on journey to Australia caught in Chennai
	
Sri Lankan refugees who were risking their lives to go to Australia ? a country that has already shut its door on asylum seekers -? were intercepted in a joint-operation involving the Q-Branch, Coastal Security Group (CSG), and Tiruvallur police, in the small hours of Thursday near Chennai.
Two agents, both Lankan nationals, assured the refugees that they were scheduled to leave from Pulicat Lake as tourists and were to board a shipping vessel heading to Australia, to be off-loaded in Christmas Island, which is 3,710 km away from the Tamil Nadu coast.
Twenty-eight refugees from four camps ? Gummidipoondi, Puzhal, Vellore, and Bhavani Sagar (Erode) ? who had paid for the trip were intercepted while being transported by road at two locations, Tirupalaivanam and Sholavaram police limits, in neighbouring Tiruvallur district, between 2 am and 5 am.
Thirteen of the 28 were men and they were picked up by the police while the women and children, to be recorded as witnesses, would be sent back to their respective camps. Besides, three drivers hired to drop the refugees at Pulicat Lake and two-wheeler riders escorting the group were also arrested.
?It is highly improbable to make it to Australia by a boat and it is nothing but a cheating racket. We have been trying to sensitise refugees on the dangerous trip that they should not be undertaking. They are so engrossed in the idea of going to Sri Lanka and financing Rs 1 or Rs 2 lakh as demanded by the agents through their kin resettled elsewhere. It is also suspected that the agents themselves tip off the police to scuttle the journey and thus maximise their profits, given the challenges in the trip,? S.C. Chandrahasan, founder, Organisation for Eelam Refugees Rehabilitation, told DC.
Mr Chandrahasan added, ?Australia is gearing up for elections and the refugee issue will be a major poll plank like last time. Most Australians do not want their tax money to be spent on refugees whose economic prosperity once they are allowed into the country is envied.?(Deccan Chronicle)

We finally won the battle: GMOA
	
While the dispute between the Health Ministry and doctors of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) was settled, the controversial Post Intern Doctors? Appointment List has been newly prepared by the ministry with the consent of the GMOA.
Health Services Director Dr. Palitha Mahipala made this announcement at a joint media briefing held today at the Health Ministry with the GMOA General Secretary and the Secretaries of the Health Ministry.
GMOA General Secretary Dr. Nalinda Herath said it decided to suspend the proposed indefinite strike next week as their demand was accepted and implemented by the minister.
However, he said they would stay vigilant whether the ministry would publish the newly prepared list of vacancies or replace it with another list.
?We are happy that finally we were able to prepare the list of vacancies according to the skills and welfare of our doctors,? Dr. Herath said.
Health Services Director Dr. Palitha Mahipala said as the discussion held between Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne and the GMOA ended on a successful note, the Minister agreed to prepare a new list following the continuous objection by the government doctors.
Accordingly, the new list which was approved by all stakeholders will be published tomorrow on the Health Ministry?s official web site http://www.health.gov.lk/en/.
Thirty seven hospitals that were closed would reopen for patients with the implementation of the new Post Intern Doctors? Appointment List, Dr. Mahipala said.
One thousand and sixty five new doctors will be assigned for hospitals countrywide, he said.
?There is no problem between the two parties now. We have settled all disagreements now. We will give 7 days to the new doctors so that they can apply for the vacancies as they wished. After that, we will consider them and assign them soon,? Dr. Mahipala added.
Meanwhile, responding to a question raised by a journalist, the GMOA General Secretary said they would anyway go ahead with the proposed legal action against Health Minister Senratne?s son and MP Chatura Senaratne over the derogatory remarks he had allegedly made against strike of the doctors.
