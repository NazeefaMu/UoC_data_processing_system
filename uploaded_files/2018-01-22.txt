Action will be taken against Uva CM if guilty: SLFP
	
Minister Susil Premajayantha today condemned the incident where Uva Chief Minister Chamara Dassanayaka is alleged to have asked the Principal of a Tamil Girls School to kneel down in his presence and said the SLFP would take action after an inquiry before the LG polls.
He said political parties must pay more attention when nominations are given to candidates to contest elections representing the party and must be more careful when political positions are given to them.
He told the weekly SLFP news briefing that Sri Lankan politics was in dire need of a system to screen candidates contesting presidential, parliamentary, provincial council and local government elections.
?If not, no one can prevent unsuitable and unqualified bad characters from taking political office,? the minister said.
However, responding to Daily Mirror, the minister maintained that a party leader and officials must be careful and open minded when a sensitive political decisions were taken in the middle of an election and added that the damage to the SLFP could be minimized if a decision was taken on Mr. Dassanayaka as early as possible .
The SLFP will be extremely careful when Mayors, Deputy Mayors, Chairmen and Deputy Chairmen of Municipal Councils, Urban Councils and Pradeshia Sabhas are chosen after the LG polls, he said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

All Opposition parties, sans JO, now in 'Yahapalana' Govt., says MR
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday claimed that while there was a yahapalana government in power there was a yahapalana opposition as well.
Issuing a statement, he said after the August 2015 parliamentary election, the UNP Speaker refused to recognize the joint opposition which had over 50 MPs as being a part of the opposition and gave the opposition leadership to the TNA, which had just 16 MPs, instead .
?The JVP which had six MPs was given the position of chief opposition whip. Hence, we now have a situation in this country where the joint opposition, which votes against the budget every year and opposes the government both inside and outside parliament, is not considered by the UNP Speaker to be a part of the opposition, while the TNA which always votes with the government during the budget and cooperates with them both inside and outside parliament is considered the main opposition.
The TNA and the JVP were included in the all-powerful National Executive Council which was formed over and above the Cabinet to run the country immediately after the 2015 presidential election. When an Anti-Corruption Committee was formed under the leadership of the Prime Minister for the purpose of persecuting and jailing members of the previous government, the JVP and TNA were once again given prominent roles in this set up. For example, the Urgent Response Unit of this Anti-Corruption Committee was placed under the personal supervision of JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake. In the first days of the yahapalana government, JVP cadres took over the functions of the police and raided various government and private premises searching for evidence of wrongdoings by the previous government.
When this operation was formalized in the form of the FCID, the leaders of the JVP and TNA continued to function in the Anti-Corruption Committee which controlled the new police unit. While masquerading as opposition political parties, the JVP and the TNA have supported every anti-democratic action taken by this government in the past three years. In August 2017, they helped the government pass a new local government elections law in contravention of the Constitution and the standing orders of parliament. A whole new election system was introduced as committee stage amendments to a Bill that had been introduced in Parliament to correct some technical errors in the then local government elections law. For the first time in parliamentary history, the Bill that was passed at the third reading in Parliament was not the Bill that was debated at the second reading,? he said.

Twenty women petitioners including veteran actress Swarna Mallawarachchi had filed a Fundamental Rights petition in the Supreme Court today challenging the 1979 law which prohibits the sale of alcohol to women.
Earlier, 11 women including artiste Samanalee Fonseka filed the first FR petition in the Supreme Court challenging the archaic law.
Human rights activist Menaka Galgamuwa said the 1979 law not only discriminatory against women but also insulting.
?This is not about women consuming alcohol. Nowhere in the 1979 law, it states that women can?t consume alcohol. It stresses on women buying alcohol. As long as men can buy alcohol, the 1979 law is discriminatory against women. Also, it is insulting on the ground that women can consume alcohol if a man buys and offers them alcohol,? she told the Daily Mirror.
Comp?re and social activist Savithri Rodrigo and Chloe De Soysa, the founding chairperson of Women?s Chamber of Commerce are also among the 20 petitioners who filed the FR. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

The culprits, who were implicated in the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) report should be punished under the civil law but under the criminal law, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), Chairman G.L. Peiris said today.
He told a news conference that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was controlling the Attorney General's Department and he was attempting to conduct civil case against the culprits.
?In a civil case, the suspects will only have to pay compensation. The entire loss to the country in the bond scam is estimated as Rs.2000 billion. Thus, it is essential to punish the culprits under the criminal law,? Mr. Peiris said.
He said the President and the Prime Minister should be held responsible for the bond scam because they appointed Arjuna Mahendran as CB governor.
?The PM and the President were aware that Arjuna Mahendran was a Singapore citizen. They are acting as if they had not done anything,? Mr. Peiris said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CEYPETCO) today banned the distribution of the ? Lanka Kerosene Oil? (red color) to vehicles, factories, barrels and other wholesale distributions.
The CEYPETCO said that, out of the two types of Kerosene- ?Industrial Kerosene? and ?Lanka Kerosene?, the latter is used by the fishing community and those with lower income households.
Accordingly, by circular number 987, the CEYPETCO had directed all dealers to stop distributing Lanka Kerosene to factories and other wholesale outlets, after discovering that many dealers have been distributing Lanka Kerosene instead of Industrial Kerosene.
The CEYPETCO said that it identified that dealers have been selling Lanka Kerosene instead of Industrial Kerosene in order to maximize profits as the former is given to dealers at a subsidized rate.
The circular directed all distributors to ensure that the subsidized kerosene was solely given to low income families and the fishing community.

With German, Chinese and Tamil translations in addition to English and Sinhala
The Chief Incumbent of Sri Sudarshanarama Purana Viharaya in Rajagiriya, Kalapaluwawa, Venerable Uluvitike Anuruddha Thera recently released a six-language Dhammapada edition including German, Chinese and Tamil translations, at a ceremony held at the temple.? ?
"The contents of the verses, however, transcend the limited and particular circumstances of their origin, reaching out through the ages"
Writing the introduction to this beautiful rectangular- shaped book, is Venerable Anuruddha Thera who has mentioned that it had been published with the view of disseminating the authentic message of Buddha to the public.? ?
The first copy of the book was presented to Chief Incumbent of Sri Sammbuddhaloka Viharaya of Madiwela, Venerable Weligalle Pannaloka Thera by author Ven Anuruddha.? ?
The Dhammapada is the best known and most widely read text in the Pali Tipitaka is included in the Khuddaka Nikaya of the Sutta Pitaka. It has been recognized as a world religious classic.? ?
Composed in the ancient Pali language, this anthology of verses constitutes a perfect collection of the Buddha?s teaching, comprising between its covers all the essential principles elaborated at length in the forty-odd volumes of the Pali canon.? ?
"Composed in the ancient Pali language, this anthology of verses constitutes a perfect collection of the Buddha?s teaching"
Each verse in the Dhammapada was originally spoken by the Buddha in response to a particular episode. Accounts of these, along with exegesis of the verses, are preserved in the classic commentary to the work, compiled by the great scholastic Bhadantacariya Buddhaghosa in the fifth century C.E. on the basis or material going back to very ancient times.
The contents of the verses, however, transcend the limited and particular circumstances of their origin, reaching out through the ages to various types of people in all the diverse situations of life. For the simple and unsophisticated the Dhammapada is a sympathetic counsellor; for the intellectually overburdened its clear and direct teachings inspire humility and reflection; for the earnest seeker it is a perennial source of inspiration and practical instruction.
Insights that flashed into the heart of the Buddha have crystallized into these luminous verses of pure wisdom. As profound expressions of practical spirituality, each verse is a guideline to right living.
The Buddha unambiguously pointed out that whoever earnestly practises the teachings found in the Dhammapada will taste the bliss of emancipation.? ?

## Title: Keys to Successful Investing and Portfolio Management

Keys to Successful Investing and Portfolio Management
	
Basic principles that can help you unlock the door to financial independence
At its core, investing in the stock market is a simple activity. That doesn?t mean it is easy, just that the behaviour necessary for success are fairly straightforward. By reminding yourself of what they are and always keeping them in the back of your mind, you can improve your odds of reaching financial independence as you amass a collection of assets that throw off passive income.
Investing key #1. Insist upon a margin of safety
Benjamin Graham, the father of modern security analysis, taught that building a margin of safety into your investments is the single most important thing you can do to protect your portfolio. There are two ways you can incorporate this principle into your investment selection process.
First: Be conservative in your valuation assumptions
As a class, investors have a peculiar habit of extrapolating the recent events into the future. When times are good, they become overly optimistic about the prospects of their enterprises. As Graham pointed out in his landmark investment treatise, The Intelligent Investor, the chief risk is not overpaying for excellent businesses, but rather, paying too much for mediocre businesses during generally prosperous times.
To avoid this sorry situation, it is important that you are on the side of caution, especially in the area of estimating future growth rates when valuing a business to determine the potential return.
Second: Only purchase assets trading near (in the case of excellent businesses) or substantially below (in the case of other businesses) your conservative estimate of intrinsic value
Once you?ve conservatively estimated the intrinsic value of a stock or private business, such as a car wash held through a limited liability company, you should make sure you are getting a fair deal. How much you are willing to pay depends on a variety of factors but that price will determine your rate of return.
In the case of an exceptional enterprise - the type of company that has huge competitive advantages, economies of scale, brand name protection, mouth-watering returns on capital and a strong balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement - paying a full price and regularly buying additional shares through new purchases and reinvesting your dividends, can be rational.??
Investing key #2. Only invest in businesses or assets you understand. It?s important you recognize your own limitations
How can you estimate the future earnings per share of a company? You?d build spreadsheets, run scenarios and come up with a range of future projections based on different confidence levels. All of this requires understanding how the businesses make their money, how the cash flows into the treasury.??
Shockingly, many investors ignore this common sense and invest in companies that operate outside of their knowledge base. Unless you truly understand the economics of an industry and can forecast where a business will be within five to 10 years with reasonable certainty, do not purchase the stock. In most cases, your actions are driven by a fear of being left out of a ?sure thing? or forgoing the potential of a huge payoff.?
From a societal standpoint, these technological advances were major accomplishments. As investments, a vast majority fizzled. The key is to avoid seduction by excitement. The money spends the same, regardless of whether you are selling hot dogs or microchips. Forget this and you can lose everything.??
Investing key #3. Measure your success by the underlying operating performance of the business, not the stock price
Unfortunately, a great many men and women look to the current market price of an asset for validation and measurement when, in the long-run, it simply follows the underlying performance of the cash generated by the asset. The lesson? Focus on that underlying performance.? It?s what counts.
That fundamentals matter seems to be an impossible truth for a certain minority of people to grasp, particularly those with a penchant for gambling. To people like that, stocks are nothing more than magical lottery tickets. These types of speculators come and go, getting wiped out after nearly every subsequent collapse.? The truly disciplined investor can avoid all of the nonsense by acquiring things that generate ever-growing sums of cash, holding them in the most tax-efficient way they have available to them and letting time do the rest.? Whether you?re up 30 percent or 50 percent in any given year doesn?t matter much as long as the profits and dividends keep growing skyward at a rate substantially in excess of inflation and that represents a good return on equity.
Investing key #4. Have a rational disposition toward price
There is one rule of mathematics that is unavoidable: the higher a price you pay for an asset in relation to its earnings, the lower your return assuming a constant valuation multiple. It?s that simple. The same stock that was a terrible investment at Rs.40 per share may be a wonderful investment at Rs.20 per share. In the hustle and bustle, many people forget this basic premise and sadly, pay for it with their pocketbooks.
Imagine you purchased a new home for Rs.5,000,000 in an excellent neighbourhood. A week later, someone knocks on your door and offers you Rs.3,000,000 for the house. You would laugh in their face. In the stock market, you may be likely to panic and sell your proportional interest in the business simply because other people think it is worth less than you paid for it.
If you?ve done your homework, provided an ample margin of safety and are encouraged about the long-term economics of the business, you should view price declines as a wonderful opportunity to acquire more of a good thing. If those statements aren?t true, then you shouldn?t have purchased the stock in the first place. Instead, people tend to get excited about stocks that rapidly increase in price; a completely irrational position for those that were hoping to build a large position in the business.?
Investing key #5. Keep your eyes open for opportunity at all times
Like all great investors, famed mutual fund manager Peter Lynch was always on the lookout for the next opportunity. During his tenure at Fidelity, he made no secret of his investigative homework: Travelling the country, examining companies, testing products, visiting management and quizzing his family about their shopping trips. It led him to discover some of the greatest growth stories of his day long before Wall Street became aware they existed.
The same holds true for your portfolio. By simply keeping your eyes open, you can stumble onto a profitable enterprise far easier than you can by scanning the pages of Financials.?
By adhering to a plan like this, you make sure the money gets allocated to the most advantageous uses first, providing the most utility for you and your family if you run out of cash to save before reaching the bottom of the list.

No mention of a Rajapaksa era bond fraud in the report: PHU
	
The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) today said the bond report had not made any reference to a Rs.4,000 billion worth of bond transaction frauds which had allegedly taken place during the Rajapaksa era as claimed by the President and the Prime Minister.
PHU Leader and MP Udaya Gammanpila said both the President and Prime Minister continue to say that the bond report had mentioned about Rs.4,000 billion worth of bond frauds had taken place during the previous government's time.
?I read the 945-page long bond report from the beginning till the end. I only have to go through appendices now. The report has made no reference to such a fraud during the Rajapaksa regime as claimed. I challenge those who made these claims to show where such a thing had been mentioned in the report," he told a news briefing.
He said there is a significant mention on page numbered 915 of the bond report among recommendations.
?The 11th recommendation says there is adequate evidence to form the view that there is a likelihood that some irregularities have taken place in the acceptance of Direct Placements (DP) prior to 2015,? he said.
The report recommends that an appropriate investigation, a forensic audit, be carried out to ascertain whether there were significant irregularities in the acceptance of DP during the period of 2008 to 2014 and if so, to identify the officers of the Public Dept Department and the superior officers of the Central Bank, primary dealers and others responsible.
?Other than this, the report doesn?t say a fraud of Rs.4,000 billion had taken place during the Rajapaksa regime," he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva said yesterday that the government would close down the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) and transfer all its students, the staff, assets and liabilities to an institution to be named ?Sunset?.
Dr. de Silva told Daily Mirror that no more admissions would be allowed for the SAITM hereafter. Instead, he said the current students would be transferred to the new institution after all the batches transferred from SAITM pass out within a period of five years.
In addition, he said the government would establish yet another non-state, not for profit medical college affiliated to Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT) next year. He said medical degrees would be offered here in conformity with standards stipulated by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).
The Deputy Minister said the government?s solution would address the two main concerns raised against SAITM. ?One is with regards to the quality of the medical degree that is being offered. The other is profit making. We are now addressing both the concerns,? he said.
He said the Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital would also be acquired by the government. ?Its liabilities will be absorbed by the new institution. Additionally, its assets will be vested with the Health Ministry,? he said.(Kelum Bandara)

DPA, 21st JANUARY, 2018-Turkish ground forces have crossed the Syrian border into the Kurdish-held enclave of Afrin, the state-run Anadolu news agency reported Sunday.
The Turkish army was reportedly accompanied by Ankara-allied Free Syrian Army (FSA) fighters.

Turkey opened a new front in Syria?s nearly seven-year-old war on Saturday, launching airstrikes against a U.S.-backed Kurdish militia (YPG) in Afrin province that raise the prospect of a further strain on relations between Ankara and Washington.? ?
?The operation, dubbed ?Operation Olive Branch? by Ankara, pits Turkey against Kurdish fighters allied to the United States at a time when ties between Turkey and Washington? appear dangerously close to a breaking point.? ?Earlier Saturday, the Turkish military said it hit shelters and hideouts used by the YPG and other Kurdish fighters, saying Kurdish militants had fired on Turkish positions inside Turkey. But the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces -which YPG spearheads- accused Turkey of using cross-border shelling as a false pretext to launch its offensive in Syria.? ?
?The YPG?s growing strength across large parts of northern Syria has alarmed Ankara, which fears the creation of an independent Kurdish state on its southern border.? ?
The YPG said the strikes killed six civilians and three fighters. One of the fighters belonged to the YPG and two were from its all-female affiliate, YPG spokesman Birusk Hasaka said. The attacks also wounded 13 civilians, he said.? ?
?The strikes on the Syrian-Kurdish YPG militia hit some 108 targets, the Turkish military said. On land, the Turkey-backed Free Syrian Army rebels were also helping the operation in Afrin, a senior Turkish official said. -?

The Maskeliya Police had requested the Commissioner General of Archaeology to conduct an archeological survey into a second set of footprints found on a rock located in a tea estate that lies in close proximity to the Sri Paada mountain range.This discovery comes in the wake of another set of footprints a a location nearby.
Police OIC Tyronne Ratnayake had put in this request.
A group of estate workers had come across the foot prints which were said to be embedded about three inches into a rock boulder. They were said to be performing Poojas (rituals) there after putting up a makeshift shed over the prints in order to protect them and pouring saffron water over them in a show of reverence. The toes can clearly be seen in this footprint.
The footprints have become all the more mysterious as according to the villagers no one approaches this rock which is situated in an area above the Moussakele Reservoir.(Ranjith Rajapaksa)

Underworld characters in this Govt: Mano Ganesan
	
National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages Minister Mano Ganesan said today there were those involved in underworld criminal activities and drug trafficking in this government.
He said those elements would not be allowed to scuttle the forward march of this government.
?We are ready to give tuition to all the parties including the United National Party (UNP) and the United People?s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) on reconciliation. We can then stake a claim to this government. If somebody calls this a UNP or SLFP government, it will be a foolish remark. We all played a role in installing this government,? he said.
