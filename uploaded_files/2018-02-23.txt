Active Liability Management Bill: Bandula files petition in SC
	
Former Deputy Finance Minister Bandula Gunawardane filed a petition before the Supreme Court seeking its Special Determination on the Bill titled ?Active Liability Management? presented to Parliament and placed on the Order Paper on 19.02.2018.
He laments that the said Bill is drafted in a manner to abrogate the powers of the Central Bank and shift such powers (directly and/or indirectly) to the Minister and alleges this amounts to an abdication of legislative powers of the people exercising it through the Parliament.
He states the immunity given by a clause to public servants, members of the Monetary Board from civil and criminal liability, is irrational and capricious and endangers the economy of the country and the national security, and would lead to acts of fraud and corruption.
The proposed Bill states as an Act to authorise the raising of loans in or outside Sri Lanka for the purpose of active liability management to improve public debt management in Sri Lanka and to make provisions for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.
He states certain clauses of the Bill Deprive and abrogates the powers of Parliament to have full control over public finance and deprive and abrogate the powers and duties of the Central Bank and the Monetary Board to manage public debts.
He also states that the clauses empower the Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers, with the authority to be in charge of and thereby to regulate and control the affairs of and matters in relation to public debt.
He complains that it shall enact a law with ?retrospective effect? which defeats and nullifies the budget speech of the Government presented to the Parliament and the Appropriation Act.
He states the Bill is in conflict with the provisions of the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act and is intended to curtail the controlling powers of the Parliament over public finance. (S.S. Selvanayagam)

Controlling risk by knowing about cholesterol
	
?
??Cholesterol? is a common, but frightful word since one out of three people are suffering from this fatal metabolic disorder due to busy and unhealthy lifestyles they lead. However, cholesterol is an essential component in the equation for a healthy body. Without it our body would not function properly because it plays a critical role in human body functions including production of steroid hormones (estrogen and testosterone) which have a direct bearing on weight, sex, digestion and mental status, digestion of fat by bile (which generates in liver) and building the structure of cells along with polar lipids.?
Cholesterol metabolism in the body
The body has the ability to produce 80% of the cholesterol requirement for proper functioning of our body once we reach childhood. This type of cholesterol is known as serum cholesterol and it is synthesis in liver under negative feedback regulation. However, unfortunately, the majority of people don?t know about it. Since dietary fat improves the taste of food, most people feed on different types of dietary fat sources which exceed the minimum dietary cholesterol requirement. The cholesterol level of each food may vary by their origin and category. The most important fact is only animal based food contain cholesterol while food derived from plants contain no cholesterol. After food ingestion, cholesterol in our diet is absorbed from the small intestine and then metabolize and store in the Liver.
If the body requires cholesterol, it may be produced by the liver. When liver cells contain higher amount of cholesterol, it decreases the activity of an enzyme which is required for cholesterol synthesis. And also, if the body has produced cholesterol in excess, liver cells remove the cholesterol from the body by converting it to bile salts and putting it into the bile where it can be eliminated in the feces.? ?
?
?Bad cholesterol? and ?Good cholesterol?
While in our bloodstream, cholesterol doesn?t have ability to circulate alone. Therefore, it binds with lipoproteins in the blood. There are four major types of lipoproteins including chylomicrons, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), which are based on density and amount of protein present in there relation to the amount of cholesterol present. Among these lipoprotein groups, LDL is known as bad cholesterol since it contains a higher level of cholesterol and a lower level of protein. HDL is good cholesterol which contains higher protein content than cholesterol content and it acts as a scavenger, carrying LDL cholesterol away from the arteries and returns back to the liver.??
?
Fatty acid types?in diet
There are different types of dietary fats such as lipids, triglycerides, saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, poly unsaturated fatty acids, essential fatty acids (omega 03 and 06) and trans fatty acids. Among these dietary fat groups, saturated fats and trans fat are not good for the health whereas unsaturated fatty acids are healthier. According to research studies, types of these dietary fats can affect to blood cholesterol level. For an example, saturated fats and trans fats raise the total and LDL cholesterol level in blood. Monounsaturated fats lower the LDL cholesterol and raises HDL cholesterol while polyunsaturated fatty acids can lower the total, LDL and HDL cholesterol levels in blood. And also omega 06 fatty acids improve the health of the heart by lowering LDL cholesterol level. Triglyceride is the most common type of fat in the body and it increases the cholesterol clot in artery walls which links with low HDL cholesterol and high LDL cholesterol and omega 3 fatty acids can lower the triglyceride level in the body.? ?
?
Sources of unhealthy fatty acids
Most of these unhealthy saturated dietary fatty acids come from animal derived food such as, butter, cream, ghee, regular fat milk, cheese, fatty cuts of beef, pork, processed meats such as salami and sausages and some plant derived products including palm oil, coconut oil and milk, cocoa butter and hydrogenated vegetable oil. Trans fats are commonly found in most junk food named snacks, deep fried food, cakes, biscuits, frozen pizza, cookies, pastries etc.? ?
?
Sources of healthy fatty acids
Different types of unsaturated fatty acids are rich in plant oil. For instance, monounsaturated fatty acids are included in olive oil, peanut oil, avocado, nuts and seeds while polyunsaturated fatty acids are contained in sunflower oil, corn oil, soybean oil etc. Fish is also a rich source of poly unsaturated fatty acids and omega 03 fatty acids which help to increase HDL cholesterol in blood. Furthermore, shellfish and other seafood (shrimp, crabs, squids, lobsters, oysters and clams) have significant amount of polyunsaturated fat content.? ?
Therefore, the consumption of plant derived dietary fats are safer than the consumption of animal based dietary fat sources except fish.? ?
?
Influence of?genetic factor?
Unhealthy fatty diet is not the only cause for a higher blood cholesterol level. Genetic influence also highly contributes to this metabolic disorder. It is known as ?familial hypercholesterolemia? where the number of liver receptor cells are lower due to defects in the genes that encodes the LDL receptor. As a result of both diet and genetic factors, nowadays a higher number of global population is susceptible to this non-communicable disease.? ?
?
Adverse effects of cholesterol
The liver is a crucial organ in our body which has the ability to regulate bad (LDL) cholesterol in our body. However, if there are fewer liver cells or if they don?t function effectively on controlling of LDL cholesterol, the unhealthy cholesterol level may increase.? ?
Bad Cholesterol (LDL) directly affects the building up of cholesterol clots in artery and it subsequently causes to form narrow arteries which raise the risk of coronary heart diseases, heart strokes and reduce the blood flow to limbs by narrowing arteries.? ?
?
Prevention
Lifestyle changes might help to reduce the elevated blood cholesterol level by losing weight, exercising, quitting smoking, choosing healthier fats (cuts off saturated fats and partially hydrogenated vegetable fats and choosing of unsaturated fats), eliminating trans-fat (avoid junk food), feeding on omega 03 fatty acids (salmon and mackerel like fish), increasing of soluble fiber intake (oats, fruits, beans and vegetables), using healthy cooking methods ( use nonstick pan instead of adding fats such as butter or margarine), avoiding cooking food with previously used vegetable oil because repeated heating of cooking oils are the cause for trans-fat formation and limiting the use of blended coconut milk regularly during food preparation since it increases the lipid content in milk.? ?
In conclusion, cholesterol is one of the prominent controllable risk factor for heart diseases while it leads to a higher number of annual mortality rate among the global population. Unhealthy dietary habits, lifestyle and lack of awareness regarding cholesterol metabolism are major causes for this metabolic disorder. Believing in some myths related to disease control also leads to some health risks. For an example, some people believe that alcohol helps the increase of good cholesterol (HDL), but unfortunately, too much alcohol consumption could damage the liver and increase the risk of elevated LDL and other health issues as well. Therefore, having better awareness regarding disease might be of help in protecting and controlling the serum cholesterol level before it develops adverse health issues.? ?

## Title: De-worming your child What you need to know
## Section: Medicine

De-worming your child What you need to know
	
?
Worm infections are a common ailment, especially when bringing up children. But it can become a nightmare for parents because of their recurrence and their ability to spread easily, making the whole family affected in no time. Though barely visible to the naked eye, during most times, they can disturb the sleep and the children?s ability to study, even affecting their long term health, at times. Health Capsule consulted Dr. Deepal Perera, Consultant Paediatrician of the Apeksha Hospital, Maharagama, to obtain more information about worm infections in children.?
Following are excerpts of an interview done with Dr. Perera.?
Q What are the types of worm infections that are present in Sri Lanka?
There is the pin worm or the thread worm, called Enterobias vermicularis, which is the commonest infection in Sri Lanka. The worm is small and white in colour.??
Then there is the round worm, called Ascaris lumbricoides. The worms are long and thick. Hookworms, called Necator americanus, have teeth that they use to get attached to the intestinal wall.??
In addition to these common worm species, filarial worms, the species causing filarisis in humans as well as the species causing filarisis in cats and dogs can also infest our bodies.??
?
Q When should you suspect that your child is having a worm infection?
Well, the symptoms differ according to the type of worm that infects you. When infected with thread worms, the commonest worm infection in Sri Lanka, scratching around the anal area, called pruritus ani, is the commonest symptom.?
This usually occurs at night and the cause is? female worms coming outside the gastrointestinal tract to lay eggs. This may also cause irritability in the child leading to poor sleep and bed wetting.? ?
Symptoms of anaemia can be seen in children infected with hookworms as well during severe round worm infections. They can be present with lethargy, pale skin, as well as with the condition called pica, where the person eats substances like raw rice or earthenware.? ?
During hookworm infections, there is itching in the skin between the toes, called the ground itch. This is due to the worms entering the body by piercing the skin of the feet.
??
Severe round worm infection can present as nausea and vomiting and poor appetite, as well as malnutrition of the child, due to the heavy colonization of the worms. We have observed children presenting with worms coming out of their mouths and obstructing their intestines, though it?s very rare nowadays.??
They can also present with respiratory tract problems like cough at night as well.??
?
Q How do the worms enter the body?
Again, the method differs from worm to worm. Most worms enter through our mouth. Eating food with unwashed hands, eating raw vegetables (containing eggs of the worms), even sleeping on an unwashed bedspread in the case of threadworm can result in spreading the infection.? ?
Hookworms can live in the soil and will infect through a pierced skin, while filarisis worms will enter the bloodstream when an infected insect bites you.??
?
Q How do you diagnose a worm infection?
When a child is suspected of having a worm infection, further investigations may be needed to confirm the diagnosis. Usually, the type of white blood cells called eosinophils is increased during a worm infection.? ?
?
The type of worm can be identified either by identifying the worm itself or its eggs, since each species has different eggs. This can be done through a Stool Full Report.? ?
Special tests like filarial antibody test for filarial worms and tape test in threadworm infection are also conducted when needed.??
?
QHow is a worm infection treated?
There are a number of drugs that can be used to treat worm infections. They are Mebendazole and Pyrantel Pamoate, both in the syrup and tablet form.? ?
The two most important things to consider when taking de-worming treatment are treating the whole family at once and taking a second dose, 7-10 days following the initial dose.?
This is important because there is a high chance of re-infection. As we discussed earlier, they are easily spread and therefore likely that other members of the family may also have the infection. If a single person is treated, even though he gets cured, it?s likely that he will be re-infected from a family member.? ?
A second dose of drug, given a week after the first dose, is an important point that even doctors sometimes neglect in prescribing. This step is crucial because even though the worms are killed, their eggs may survive, and will give rise to new worms through hatching, which will prolong the infection.?
?
?
Q What steps do we have to take to prevent worm infections?
Following basic rules of food hygiene, like washing the hands before eating and washing vegetables and leaves well, before preparation can go a long way towards prevention. Eating uncooked food, especially green leaves from questionable sources should be avoided, especially during floods.??
In addition to routine de-worming through drugs, washing the clothes thoroughly and sun drying them well will help destroy the eggs and prevent the further spreading of the infection.? ?
Wearing slippers when walking outside and regularly de-worming your pets will also help prevent worm infections.? ? ?

## Title: Dealing with dehydration in Children

Dealing with dehydration in Children
	
?
Water is vital for life. In fact 75 % of our body consists of water. There is no doubt why it is very important to drink water (and even other fluids) as the body constantly needs to stay hydrated. However, it is quite easy to lose fluids from the body. Sri Lanka, being a tropical island with sunny warm weather through the year, doesn?t help matters because those living here tend to lose more fluids from the body. This week?s edition of Health Capsule focuses on dehydration. Dr. Kosala Karunaratna, Consultant Paediatrician of the Lady Ridgeway Hospital, Colombo, elucidates our readers on how to keep children hydrated despite encountering obstacles like warm weather and disease.??
?Dehydration occurs as a result of the loss of fluids from the body. This can occur in a child when inflicted by conditions like diarrhoea, vomiting or gastroenteritis which is an inflammation in the stomach and intestines caused by microbial infections which leads to diarrhoea and vomiting,? explained Dr. Karunaratna. He further added that another way of the body losing its water is due to the extreme hot weather conditions which causes sweating. ?Exposure to vigorous sports and playing a lot under the sun, without proper means of constant hydration, can lead to dehydration. When children suffer from fever they are more prone to losing fluids from their bodies. When a child suffers from fever he or she becomes reluctant to drink water and other fluids. In these situations the body can get easily dehydrated,? the Paediatrician mentioned.??
?
Signs??
According to Dr. Karunaratna, there is both a severe and mild form of dehydration that children have to be guarded against. However the mild form doesn?t cause that much of an issue. ?Symptoms of the mild form of dehydration includes thirst. Usually urination takes place 6-7 times a day in children. The urine output decreases in children when they become dehydrated,? he added. Signs of severe dehydration include drowsiness, irritability, lethargy, dizziness, and headaches. It could even cause the loss of consciousness. Dry lips and skin along with sunken eyes should be enough of a sign to indicate that your child is dehydrated.??
?
ORS vs. Water???
The problem of dehydration can be solved by constantly hydrating the body through liquids and fluids. This must be done whether the source of dehydration is due to a condition like diarrhoea or whether it?s due to a hot climate. ?Hydration is important. While drinking lots of water is important for the body, when a child suffers from dehydration, just drinking a lot of pure water is not always the answer. In fact when a child is dehydrated the ideal fluid to give the child is the Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) which is referred to as ?Jeewani?. This is the best option as treatment,? the Paediatrician stressed. Why is ORS more ideal than water? Dr. Karunaratna explained that dehydration is not relieved by just pure water as it does not contain the useful electrolytes that enhance absorption in the body that contributes to better hydration. It is important that a rich content of electrolyte minerals such as sodium and potassium, glucose is given with the fluids.??
?Losing fluids is dangerous. This could directly affect the brain cells. Substances are absorbed by the small and large intestines of the body. The electrolytes coupled with the fluids given will enhance the absorption of water, increasing the efficiency of absorption of nutrients in the body,? he explicated. ?Since the time of the cholera epidemic, ORS has come under the spotlight for proving itself as an efficient method of treating dehydration. ?Water is lost from the gut, which releases excreta like water from a tap, when one contracts the disease. ORS proved a worthy medication during such an epidemic. It is still the best cure for dehydration. ORS contains sodium minerals and glucose in equal amounts. This facilitates water absorption in the body. If electrolytes were not provided with pure water, the water would not be absorbed fast enough,? added the doctor. ?ORS is not very tasty. Children may refuse to consume ORS due to its taste. If the dehydration is not very severe, alternatives like soup with added salt and fruit juices can be given along with water. Pure water on its own will not be sufficient,? Dr. Karunaratna advised.??
ORS can be given in a volume to the volume of fluids lost by the child when dehydrated. If diarrhea and severe symptoms of dehydration are displayed, then a volume of 100 ml or so should be given. Saline would be provided as well in some cases depending on the severity.If it just a mild case of dehydration, 50ml of ORS would help hydrate the body back to health.? ?
?
How dangerous is dehydration???
?While mild cases of dehydration do not impose huge threats to the health, the more severe levels of dehydration could affect the brain. Such conditions could become seriously dangerous. Not just the brain, but other organs would be affected too. This condition could even lead up to kidney failure,? he warned.? ?
If dehydration occurs solely due to hot weather, it is advised not to be exposed out in the sun for long periods of time and if so sufficient nourishment has to be given for the patient to stay hydrated. Water and fluids should be taken. If a child is sick and suffers from conditions like fever, there is a higher risk of getting dehydrated. ORS would be a good choice of fluid to provide during these circumstances. Sri Lanka being a warm country is enough of a reason to stay alert on how much water your body loses as it is easy to get dehydrated during warm weather.? ?
?ORS is a wonder to prevent or treat dehydration. King coconut water is a natural alternative to ORS and is said to be quite comparable to ORS. It is quite a refreshing drink as well. In Sri Lanka this is a drink which is rightly quite famous among the citizens. Sophisticated medicine is not always the answer,? the doctor concluded.? ?

EC hints of holding PC polls by September
	
The Elections Commission yesterday hinted that the Provincial Council Election could be held in September, since the terms of the Central, Northern and North Western Provincial Councils were likely to expire and be dissolved by then.
Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya told a news conference that the North Central, Eastern and Sabaragamuwa Provincial Councils had already been dissolved, but added that the Parliament was the sole authority on when to hold these elections.
?In order to hold the Provincial Council election, the report of the delimitation committee should be presented by the subject minister to Parliament and it should be passed by a special majority. If not, the Prime Minister could appoint a committee to proceed with the delimitation report,? he added.
He said the duty of the Elections Commission was to prevent delays in the holding of elections and added that they were duty bound to safeguard the franchise and sovereignty of the people.
While referring to the issues that had arisen in the Maharagama Urban Council, he said the members of an independent group could not be forcefully removed by anyone unless they resign voluntarily. However he pointed out that the candidate belonging to a certain party could be asked to resign and a party?s leadership could either remove or suspend such a candidate unlike in the case of independent groups.
?As per the provisions in the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Act, that person has to be qualified to be a elector and has only to prove ordinary residency in a certain electorate. It is not necessary to be a qualified voter or to prove permanent residency in order to be able to vote ,? he said.
He said the Elections Commission does not have the authority to provide its opinion on this issue and added that it was the duty of the related party to provide the aforesaid criteria through a competent court.
Meanwhile, he said the Elections Commission had never intended to reduce the implementation of the 25 per cent quota for women even though they had no authority to make it mandatory; ?However, we warmly welcome the increase of women representation in local authorities,? he added.
He also said the deputy commissioners and assistant commissioners, being the returning officers of the relevant councils, had sent letters to the political party secretaries and independent group leaders to nominate the numbers of candidates from list one and two (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Hospital laundry to be outsourced to Indian company: GMOA
	
The Government is expected to pay US $ 7.5 million to an Indian company for laundry service of local hospitals, risking the jobs of Sri Lankans even before ETCA was signed, the GMOA said yesterday.
Referring to the Sri Lankan delegation which visited India for discussions on the trade agreement, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said it would create issues in the Sri Lankan job market.
?If authorities were attempting to outsource laundry services of the country to India, it will result in hundreds of Sri Lankans losing their jobs.?
Dr. Aluthge warned that the situation would worsen in the future, if the country was to sign the ETCA. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

IgniterSpace celebrates two years of social impact with three major accolades
	
Jehan Wijesinghe, CEO & Co-Founder IgniterSpace, receives the e-Swabhimani award for Learning & Education
When software engineer Hasith Yaggahavita founded IgniterSpace, together with two colleagues, he was simply making up for the lack of a good creative education- or more specifically, ?makerspace?- programmes to enrol his own kids in. So, in March 2016 IgniterSpace began its journey in Hasith?s home. A short two years later Hasith and his team are quietly celebrating a rapid expansion and a couple of unexpected, yet well-deserved wins at the e-Swabhimani awards 2017 and Venture Engine 2017.?
IgniterSpace is a ?makerspace? for kids that guides them to unleash their creativity through technology. Although not a phrase used in common parlance, a makerspace is simply a place where students can gather to create, invent and tinker using tools, material and some guidance. With the firm belief that anything is possible, IgniterSpace inspires students to be creative and innovative. Children are exposed to different aspects of technology such as mechanical, electrical, electronic computer programming and robotics. With this foundation, they are then encouraged to further experiment to gain deeper insights.?
The company quickly grew from being a small operation at Hasith?s home to a very popular educational institute coveted by parents who wanted their kids to have the IgniterSpace experience. Mano Sekaram, Hasith?s long-time mentor and eminent IT industry heavyweight, joined in to help IgniterSpace grow. Mano recognized that the company was doing something unusual and creative, and helped the team move into a second makerspace in Narahenpita, and then to other cities such as Moratuwa, Gampaha, Negombo and Kandy.?
Dumith Fernando, Chairman Asia Securities (Pvt) Ltd., Sanchayan Chakraborty, Partner, Aavishkaar and Jeevan Gnanam, CEO Orion City, award Hasith Yaggahawita, Founder IgniterSpace and Jehan Wijesinghe, CEO & Co-Founder IgniterSpace the Venture Engine 1st runner up position.
Today the IgniterSpace team consists of 15 full time professionals and 45 part-time instructors led by CEO Jehan Wijesinghe and COO Buddika Wijesekera. Their educational model is a tried, tested and loved by kids. Students begin with prototyping known machines to develop basic knowledge as well as fine motor skills and then move onto production grade explorative creations. Through these exercises, kids gain design thinking and entrepreneurship skills alongside the ability to create production grade prototypes of their own concepts.?
This is where the steps for innovation and entrepreneurship are laid, says CEO Jehan Wijesinghe. ?We are committed to guiding the younger generation to become innovators and creators of technology, but we also understand that this is not a vision that is accomplished over a short span of time. We?re ready to walk the talk with our partners over decades to come.?
The team is also celebrating placing winners in the education category at the 2017 national e-Swabhimani awards presented by the Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA). IgniterSpace also received the Aaavishkaar Social Impact Award for the highest social impact and was the 1st runner up at Venture Engine 2017. CEO Jehan also represented Sri-Lanka at the Sankalp Global Sustainability & Social Impact Summit held in Mumbai India in December 2017. For Hasith, this is further confirmation that he was onto something when he first began IgniterSpace from his living room. ?It?s rewarding to know that what you?re doing is making a real impact. We?re actually making a difference here, by teaching kids skills that they?re not picking up at school, but essential for the future.? he says.?
P. Pradeep, Executive Director, Aavishkaar presents the Aaavishkaar Social Impact Award to Jehan Wijesinghe, CEO & Co-Founder IgniterSpace and Hasith Yaggahawita, Founder IgniterSpace
The classes are conducted at five levels: first 3 levels are for age based entry (ages 5-7 years, 8-10 years, 11-15 years) and prerequisite for level 4, which is focused on problem solving. Once level 4 is completed, students can enter the IgniterSpace Start-up School where they learn to become real-world innovators and entrepreneurs. The courses are usually conducted in English, although native languages are accommodated on request.

INTERPOL issues red warrant on Udayanga: Police
	
INTERPOL had issued a ?Red Warrant' on former Sri Lankan Envoy to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga, naming him as a fugitive wanted by the Sri Lankan authorities, Police Media Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara announced.
Ex-diplomat Weeratunga was wanted in connection with certain discrepancies that had taken place in the acquisition of four MiG-27 fighter jets from the Ukrainian arms company 'Ukrinmash' in 2006 and financial misappropriation said to be taken place in overhauling four MiG fighter jets owned by the Air Force.
According to SP Gunasekara the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) had received a complaint on March 10, 2015 over the incident.
He said investigations had revealed that Mr. Weeratunga had interfered in the MiG deal and there had been suspicious deposits to his local bank accounts from foreign countries at this time.
In order to obtain a statement relating to the investigation from Mr. Weeratunga, the Fort Magistrate had issued summons on him to appear in Court on July 15, 2016, an order that he dis-obeyed.
SP Gunasekara explained that the Fort Magistrate had issued the open warrant for Mr. Weeratunga in October 20, 2016 for ignoring the court order and some USD 1.7 million amounts in his 16 bank accounts were ordered to be frozen.
Later, the Criminal Investigation Division (CID) sought INTERPOL assistance to arrest Mr. Weeratunge who was evading the courts by living overseas and the ?INTERPOL? issued a ?Blue notice? over the ex-diplomat.
SP Gunasekara said that Mr. Weeratunga?s diplomatic service had ended on February 28, 2015 but he had not returned his diplomatic passport No D3643585 to the Foreign Ministry and instead he had obtained a passport bearing the
No N5400885 from the Immigration and Emigration Controller.
In October 4, 2016 Mr. Weeratunga had travelled to the United Arab Emirates and the Immigration and Emigration Controller had impounded both his passports following an order made by the Fort Magistrate on June 30, 2017.
Mr. Weeratunga was detained at the Dubai Airport on February 4 this year while in transit to the United States but was later released after being transferred to the Abu Dhabi authorities.
A seven member delegation was dispatched to bring back the ex-diplomat on February 7, based on the bilateral understanding and the diplomatic relations between the two countries, however they were made to return home emptyhanded on February 13.
A statement issued by Police Media Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara yesterday said that Mr. Weeratunga had several opportunities to prove his innocence on the charges. However he was only attempting to create a false image over the country?s judicial system among the people by issuing media statements.
He further said Mr. Weeratunga had never requested an opportunity to make a statement to investigation officers although he claims to have done so.
Therefore, SP Gunasekara said it had been observed that Mr. Weeratunga?s claims were baseless and he was only evading the authorities without obeying the judiciary. ?Mr. Weeratunga is a Sri Lankan citizen. Instead of attempting to prove his innocence using social media, Mr. Weeratunga can appear before a court of law and prove his innocence,? SP Gunasekara added. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

However, making a U-turn soon after the polls, he had sought an audience with the leader of the party he had disparaged, they say.

MYTH: You should avoid all fats if you?re trying to be healthy or lose weight.??
BUSTED: If you?re trying to be healthier or lose weight, you may think that eliminating all fats from your diet might be the way forward. But think again. It?s a common misconception that all fat is bad.? ??In order for a human being to function properly the body requires calories. At least 30% of the calories one consumes should come from fats. There are two kinds of fat; healthy fats and unhealthy fats. Unhealthy fats are saturated fats that increase the risk of high cholesterol, diabetes and heart disease. There are two kinds of healthy fats; polyunsaturated unsaturated fats and momounsaturated fats. Both these types of fats, if consumed in moderation can help the risk of heart disease as it helps lower cholesterol levels. It?s important that you include healthy fats in your diet. Healthy fats come from sources like egg yolks, avacados, nuts and salmon. The important thing that you should understand is that moderation is key. Making sure you eat a balanced diet has a major impact on being healthy,? said, Dr. Renuka Jayatissa, Consultant Medical Nutritionist at the Medical Research Institute.? ? ?

132nd Birth Anniversary of D.R. Wijewardene falls today The Press in the fight for freedom
	
The founder of Associated Newspapers of Ceylon wrote this article in 1948, the year Ceylon gained independence. It appeared in the Ceylon ?Dally News? of February, 10, 1948.
The days are very far away now when George Wall and the Fergusons in their newspapers strove to safeguard public interest
The National Association was anterior to the League and they held a joint national conference which gave birth to the National Congress
The ?Observer? after the departure of John Ferguson declined and lost contact with public opinion
Not until ?The Ceylonese? entered the newspaper field did Ceylon have a really national organ with a vigorous nationalistic policy
D. R. Wijewardene
In the heyday of constitutional achievement, it is right and fitting that the leaders in the struggle for self government should be remembered and acclaimed. The whole country acknowledges the inestimable services rendered to the national cause by patriots from the days of George Wall and Charles Ambrose Lorenz to the vintage years of Ponnambalam Arunachalam, James Peiris, E.J. Samerawickrame, F.R. Senanayake, D.B. Jayatilaka, J.W. de Silva and E.W. Perera and at the present day, D.S. Senanayake who has won the admiration of the people for the unflagging labours that have resulted in the granting of Dominion Status. The names of these men and the loyal associates who stood shoulder to shoulder with them will never be forgotten in any chronicle in the history of our times.
The national struggle for independence had been won, and the date on which this country ceased to be a colony and emerged as a free member of the comity of world nations had just gone into history ? February 4, 1948. The ?Dally News? of the time reported the proceedings and celebrations and published many articles on various aspects of the past struggle, and the challenge of the future. Mr. Wijewardene?s contribution places in perspective the role of the newspapers in the national struggle, and the particular contribution made by the ?Daily News? and the Lake House Group of Newspapers.? ?
Force
But there is another powerful force without which the work of these men would have been handicapped to an almost baffling extent. The Press does not, with a proper sense of self-discipline, blow its trumpet from the rooftops. Yet I think this is an occasion when the country should give due recognition to the part played by the national newspapers in the difficult and sometimes dangerous campaign for political reform.? ?
The days are very far away now when George Wall and the Fergusons in their newspapers strove to safeguard the public interest to the best of their abilities and resources. There was, however no organised public opinion in their time and the issues on which they threw down the gauntlet to the primitive all ? powerful Crown Colony Government then in existence were necessarily narrow. On these issues they acquitted themselves with dignity and some success.? ?
But in those days the national consciousness was dormant and there was nothing in the spirit of the times to stir it to life and activity. That was to come later when largely as a result of Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam?s work the fire of the national soul was quickened. When he delivered himself of that epoch-making address on ?Our Political Needs? at the Masonic Hall that leader of imperishable memory set in motion influences that were to change the history of his beloved country. The immediate outcome of that meeting was the formation of the Reform League. The National Association was anterior to the League and they held a joint national conference which gave birth to the National Congress.? ?
It was then that the national movement which has brought Ceylon to the threshold of independence received its first stimulus; public opinion began to speak for the first time with a firm tone and the early national newspapers like the ?Dinamina? and ?The Ceylonese? were established.? ?
The other newspapers already in publication at the time were the old ?Ceylon Observer? the ?Morning Leader? the ?Times of Ceylon? and the ?Independent.? The ?Observer? after the departure of John Ferguson declined and lost contact with public opinion till like ?The Times of Ceylon? it became the paper of the European merchants and the European planters. The ?Morning Leader,? notwithstanding the able editor who presided over it, tended to parochialise its politics. Mr. Armand de Souza preferred easy personal celebrity to the neglect of the big issues and he had many masters with private axes of their own to grind. These limitations were too pressing for him to overcome.? ?
Not until ?The Ceylonese? entered the newspaper field did Ceylon have a really national organ with a vigorous nationalistic policy. It was well edited under the direction of Sir P. Ramanathan and Mr. Hector Jayawardene, that brilliant advocate, and at a later stage Mr. Francis De Zoysa a man of sound and steadfast principles. Its forthright and fearless exposition of the country?s political deficiencies rallied and stimulated public opinion. Unfortunately its business side was badly mismanaged and some where towards the end of 1917 ?The Ceylonese? failed.? ?
When I purchased the plant and the goodwill of ?The Ceylonese? in December of that year, I hardly realised, the magnitude of the task I was undertaking of organising not merely a national newspaper, but a campaign for the political emancipation of the country that was to continue unabated till victory was won and the really nation building work could be commenced. ?To organise,? as a great man said ?is to set men free.? In the first issue of the ?Daily News? on January 3, 1918, Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam wrote in a Special Message.? ?
?The Daily News is fortunate in the time of its birth. New forces are at work among us, a new era is dawning for the country. She needs the devoted service of all her children and will, I am confident, find none more zealous than the new paper.?? ?
Prophetic words indeed. In the thirty years since they were written Ceylon has progressed in almost every direction ? socially, politically, in the growth of a new realization by the people of their own deficiencies, their powers, their birthright and the glory of their national heritage. This progress has been rendered possible largely on account of the increasing ability of its men and women to discern and estimate with sound judgment both persons and policies in the public life of the country.??
The people can judge for themselves to what extent this new outlook has been moulded by the principles expounded unwaveringly by the ?Daily news,? by the ?Dinamina? and ?Silumina? and by (since it became an allied publication) the Ceylon ?Observer.?? ?
From the very beginning of its career the ?Daily News? fought for self-government for the people of Ceylon not as a gift or boon, but as an inalienable right. It was not going to be satisfied with piecemeal concessions. It condemned the parsimoniousness of the Manning Reforms and criticised the shortcomings of the 1924 Constitution as an insult to the growing political intelligence of the people.? ?
When the Donoughmore Scheme became an established fact the ?Daily News? once again led the agitation for the removal of its inherent defects ? notable among these the Committee System which rendered nugatory even the few liberal features of that Constitution as an instrument of Responsible Government. With persistent endeavour and tireless insistence the ?Daily News? pressed the demand for a system of government of the Parliamentary model with Cabinet responsibility.? ?
Issue
While keeping a sharp eye on the administration in the island and denouncing wrong and injustice without fear or favour the ?Daily News? never lost sight of the cardinal issue ? the right of the people of Ceylon to govern their own affairs.? ?
It was inevitable that in pursuing such a policy the paper should make enemies. When the ?Daily News? castigated the bureaucratic government of twenty years ago it retaliated with pinpricks like the withdrawal of advertising.?
That mattered little to a paper run for consideration of principle and not for pecuniary profit, though no paper can long be run at a loss. Yet the pettiness and spite of the government?s action provoked questions in the House of Commons and they had to come to the ?Daily News? again for advertising space. When the Daily News in 1922 published, to the consternation of those who concocted it, the infamous secret minorities? Memorial to Downing Street it was not loved by the conspirators it exposed.? ?
But the ?Daily News? never cadged for official patronage or capered for the plaudits of partisan cliques. It was not there to further the political ambitions of its proprietors they had none. Its mission, its lodestar was the political emancipation of the people of Ceylon so that they could meet and move among the peoples of the Commonwealth, among the nations of the world at large, as free and equal men. Can anyone grudge the pride the ?Daily News? takes today in its record of service to the country, service that has contributed so much to the Independence Ceylon has now attained?? ?

Comment
?
D. R. Wijewardene
?
Newspapers are curious institutions. They mirror their times and also influence them. They inform and they record, they do not scorn entertainment and diversion.?
They reflect public opinion and they also lead readership. He who can read, skims through the newspaper he gets into his hand or reads with interest and concentration.?
Those who work on newspapers have to be aware of this link between publication and reader, and if the awareness falls short the newspaper perishes. In Sri Lanka the newspaper reader is basically serious minded and seeks to know of national affairs, of social situations and economics of health and education.?
Readers in our country are exacting and demanding, and almost always react vigorously to what their newspapers tell them every morning and evening and on Sundays. And first of all newspapers have to start publication, set standards of writing and production and maintain them.?
All our readers would have thought on these matters from time to time, and the practical result of their thinking is that they buy or not buy.?
We cannot be accused of unseemly pride in the achievements of Lake House publications; we are very proud in the best sense of that word and every year when the death anniversary of the great founder of the institution comes around we remember him D.R. Wijewardene who passed away on 13 June, 1950.? ?
We dedicate our comment today to this outstanding son of Sri Lanka. We recall that when men destined to lead the freedom struggle were young students, some took the political path, others made their decisions to contribute through religion and a sense of history. D.R. Wijewardene had many choices and his contemporaries agreed that whatever path he took he would make his mark in our island story.?
He elected to become a newspaper publisher at a time when patriots who knew or sensed the role journalism could play in the struggle for freedom had tried and failed.?
Publications had folded up, publishers had gone to the wall and it looked as if other paths, other methods had to serve.?
D.R. Wijewardene was unique in that he made his visions reality with a genius still unmatched and the success that attended his striving as increasingly to be marvelled at as the years go by.?
His decisions were taken when he was a young man and he worked steadfastly to make his vision of a free country with its people ruling themselves a reality. He was blessed in that he saw his country free after centuries of foreign rule.? ?
We mourn as we remember this great man for he drove himself beyond the strength of a human being and died before his time. This is the price he paid the supreme sacrifice any man can make for his native land.?
Patriots by definition are ready to die for their country and if any man did so gloriously in this century in our country, it was D.R. Wijewardene.? ?
Not on the battlefield alone are heroic lives lived and heroic deeds done. There is a heroism which is rare which is built into day to day life every day, day in and day out. This was the Wijewardene way of serving ideals.?
He lived for the institution in journalism he created. He knew every aspect of its operation. He faced crises with the courage of brave men with gifts of intellect and abilities denied to lesser men and won through.?
We are reminded of the epitaph written for Sir Christopher Wren who designed and built Britain?s Cathedral of St. Paul: If you seek his monument look round. Not only Lake House itself which owes its national architectural style to D.R. Wijewardene, but the publications which come out of it, are his monument.?
The torch he lit has been handed down and nurtured, strengthened and lights national affairs.?
Journalism did not see his like before him, nor after and for that, we must all be proud and grateful.? ?

## Title: Newborns between March 3 and 26, beneficiaries of a Neechabhanga Rajayoga
## Section: Jyotisha News

Newborns between March 3 and 26, beneficiaries of a Neechabhanga Rajayoga
	
?
Venus will enter the zodiacal sign of Pisces at 11.43 hours on March 2 and Mercury too will move into Pisces at 06.56 hours on March 3 to form a Venus ? Mercury conjunction in this sign.?
?
How Neechabhanga Rajayoga arises
Venus attains exaltation (Uchcha) in Pisces whereas it is the sign of fall or debilitation (Neecha) for Mercury. According to the Astrological principles, there are several planetary positions that nullify the Neecha status of a planet leading to the rise of powerful Neechabhanga Rajayoga. One of them is the Neecha planet being placed in conjunction with the Uchcha planet in the same sign. Therefore, this is an instance where a planetary conjunction occurs leading to the rise of Neechabhanga Rajayoga.?
?
Favourable effects of Neechabhanga Rajayoga
The Neechabhanga Rajayoga makes the native powerful, wealthy, virtuous and famous. According to ancient seers, one would reap the beneficial effects of Neechabhanga Rajayoga during the combined Dasa periods of the debilitated planet and the lord of the sign that hosts the yoga-generating combination.?
?
Yoga ceases from March 26
The Neechabhanga Rajayoga-producing Venus ? Mercury conjunction will end when Venus moves into Aries at 15.47 hours on March 26. This means all children to be born between 06.56 hours on March 3 and 15.47 hours on March 26 this year will become the beneficiaries of this Subha Yoga.?
?
Other yogas and favourable effects in the offing
Those to be born into the 12 Ascendants from Aries to Pisces during the above period in addition to being fortified with the Neechabhanga Rajayoga, will become the beneficiaries of several other yogas or very favourable effects according to the Bhava-positions in their horoscopes. The Subha Yogas or favourable effects resulting from an exalted Venus in Pisces for the 12 Ascendants are as follows:
For Aries (Mesha):? Vimala Yoga due to exalted Venus placed in the 12th House.
For Taurus (Vrushabha):? An increased income without any effort, a sharp perception and help and the pleasure of the company of friends due to exalted Venus in the 11th House.

For Leo (Simha):? Sarala Yoga due to exalted Venus in the 8th House.
For Virgo (Kanya):? Malavya Yoga due to exalted Venus in the 7th House
For Libra (Thula): Harsha Yoga arising from exalted Venus in the 6th House
For Scorpio (Vrushika):? A good education, talents in arts such as music, dancing, singing etc., attractive children
For Sagittarius (Dhanu):? Malavya Yoga due to exalted Venus in the 4th House.
For Capricorn (Makara):? Popularity, a good reputation and artistic talents due to exalted Venus in the 3rd House
For Aquarius (Kumbha): Wealth, pleasing speech, charming personality and a happy married life
For Pisces (Meena):? Malavya Yoga due to exalted Venus in the 1st House or the Lagna
The beneficial effects produced by the yogas mentioned above are as follows:
Malavya Yoga: This is one of the Maha Purusha Yogas. This yoga blesses the native with a well-developed physique, healthy sense organs, conveyances, comforts, luxuries, a strong mind, wisdom, tact and diplomacy and fame.?
Harsha Yoga confers a healthy physique, wealth through various means, a good family life, a sound financial position, respect and influence in society and a position of authority.
Sarala Yoga blesses the native with longevity, a good character, knowledge and wisdom, respect and influence in society, victory over enemies, a position of power and authority.
Vimala Yoga gives the native a very good character, wealth, a position of power and authority and an acumen for good financial management.??
Amala Yoga will make the native a person of high principles and character and bestow on him a very high position, good qualities, wealth and a?good reputation.?

Prevailing dry weather may change - Met Dept.
	
There is a possibility that there could be a change to the prevailing dry weather from tomorrow and accordingly several spells of showers may occur in the Uva Province and in the Ampara and Hambantota Districts, Department of Meteorology said yesterday.
It is predicted that showers or thunder showers may occur at a few places in the Galle, Matara and Ratnapura Districts after 2.00pm.
?Due to certain changes in the South-Eastern sea areas, the possibility for heavy showers or thunder showers and sudden roughness, associated with sudden increase of wind speed (up to 70-80 kmph) in the deep sea areas off the coast extending from Matara to Batticaloa via Hambantota and Potuvil is high,? Meteorology Dept. said.
Meanwhile, it said quite colder nights and mornings can be expected and the misty conditions can be experienced at some places particularly in the southern half of the island during the morning.
When considering the sea areas, it stated that showers or thunder showers would occur at several places in the sea areas off the coast extending from Galle to Batticaloa via Hambantota and added that fair weather would prevail in the other sea areas around the island.
Winds will be north-easterly direction in the sea areas and wind speed will be 25-35 kmph.
Sea areas off the coast extending from Mannar to Colombo via Puttalam and also from Hambantota to Potuvil will be fairly rough at times as wind speed increase up to 50 kmph at times.
It requested naval and fishing communities to be vigilant in this regard. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Reparations essential to achieve reconciliation: Tittawella
	
Reparations are essential in leading to a process of reconciliation and it?should be done in parallel to a process on truth, justice, and non-recurrence, Secretary of the Secretariat for Coordinating Reconciliation Mechanisms?(SCRM), Mano Tittawella?said.
He said this in view of the?two-day international conference organised by the SCRM, International Organization for Migration (IOM) and?the UN Migration Agency?on reparations for conflict victims.?The conference was launched in Colombo?yesterday.
In a statement, the IOM said this was the first such conference to be held in Sri Lanka since the end of the war?in 2009.
?The conference follows the?UNHRC Resolution on Sri Lanka and a government decision?to actively promote reconciliation, including a system of victim reparations, that will contribute to a lasting peace,? it said.
IOM Sri Lanka Chief of Mission Giuseppe Crocetti?said transitional justice is a relatively new field which?is being expanded and enriched through experiences?from many different societies across the globe.
?A solution in one country or community does not necessarily work for others, particularly in relation to finding the right balance between what is desirable and what is feasible. It takes a whole of society approach to move from a divided past to a shared future and that is the underlying theme of this conference,? he said.
The conference brought together some 150 participants from the government and non-government sectors, development partners, UN, local and international NGOs, civil society organizations, victim groups, academics, experts and other relevant stakeholders.

SAITM students to KDU: Only part of the solution - GMOA
	
While welcoming the government?s decision to enroll SAITM students to Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (KDU), the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) yesterday said it was an important decision.
Presidential Media Unit on Wednesday said this decision was taken at a meeting held with President Maithripala Sirisena where it was decided to enroll about 1000 students who were currently studying at the SAITM to the the medical faculty of KDU after considering their basic qualifications.
GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge told a news conference that this could not be considered as the end of the SAITM issue and added that only a part of the issue had been solved following the said decision.
?It is the government?s responsibility to implement these policy decisions into a reality.
The government should also consider about the standards of medical education, and amendments with regard to the prevailing laws relating to the medical education in the country,? he added.
He said the latest decision taken by President Sirisena on the SAITM issue was appreciable and added that however this time period could not be regarded as a phase to celebrate victory.
He also said their battle against the SAITM would be even continued in future.
Meanwhile, he said they had handed over a letter to Presidential Secretariat outlining their proposals on resolving the SAITM issue on last Tuesday and added that some of their suggestions were included in the latest government?s decision. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

SL backslides in pursuing UN commitments: AI
	
Though Sri Lanka continued to pursue commitments made in 2015 to the UNHRC, progress of implementing them has been slowed and there was evidence of backsliding, the Amnesty International (AI) said on Thursday.
In its country report on Sri Lanka for 2017/2018, AI said commitments made by Sri Lanka in 2015 ? through the UN resolution had not been implemented by the end of the year.
?Sri Lanka failed to follow through on its 2015 commitment to repeal the PTA and replace it with legislation that complied with international standards. The amended Office on Missing Persons Act was passed by Parliament in June. It was signed by the President on 20 July but had not come into operation by the end of the year,? it said.
The report said Sri Lanka?s constitutional reform process, initiated in 2016, also faltered as lawmakers differed over issues such as the fate of the executive presidency, the place of Buddhism in the new Constitution, and whether economic, social and cultural rights would be included in the Bill of Rights.
By the end of 2017, the AI said Sri Lanka had not passed legislation criminalizing enforced disappearance in domestic law, despite ratifying the International Convention against Enforced Disappearance in 2016.
?A parliamentary debate on a bill criminalizing enforced disappearance scheduled for July was postponed without explanation. In June, President Sirisena promised families of the disappeared that he would order the release of lists of those who surrendered to, or were detained by, the armed forces during and after the armed conflict that ended in 2009. The lists were not made public by the end of the year,?it said.

## Title: Taking a closer look at  thyroid disorders

Taking a closer look at  thyroid disorders
	
Through the hormones the thyroid gland produces, it influences almost all the metabolic processes in the body. The thyroid gland takes the shape of a butterfly and is situated in the front of the neck. Different types of thyroid disorders affect either it?s structure or the function.??
The thyroid gland is located below the Adam?s apple wrapped around the trachea. A thin area of tissue in the gland?s middle, known as the isthmus, join the two thyroid lobes on each side. The thyroid uses iodine to produce vital hormones. Thyroxine, also known as T4, is the primary hormone produced by the gland. After delivery via the bloodstream to the body?s tissues, a small portion of the T4 released from the gland is converted to triiodothyronine [T3], which is the most active hormone.??
The Health Capsule spoke to Dr. Muditha Weerakkody, Consultant Endocrinologist at? the Teaching Hospital Karapitiya, Galle with regard to the function of the thyroid gland and the corns of thyroid disorders.??
?The function of the thyroid gland is regulated by a feedback mechanism involving the brain. When thyroid hormone levels are low, the hypothalamus produces a hormone known as thyrotropin releasing hormone [TRH] that causes the pituitary gland to release thyroid stimulating hormone [TSH]. Since the thyroid gland is controlled by the pituitary gland and hypothalamus, disorders of these tissues can also affect thyroid function and cause thyroid problems.??
?
Specific kinds of thyroid disorders
Hypothyroidism??
It is a result of producing an insufficient amount of thyroid hormone. It can develop from problems within the thyroid gland, pituitary gland or hypothalamus. Symptoms of hypothyroidism includes:?
?
? Fatigue??
? Poor concentration or feeling mentally ?foggy???
? Dry skin??
? Constipation??
? Feeling cold??
? Fluid retention??
? Muscle and joint aches??
? Depression??
? Prolonged excessive menstrual bleeding for women??
Some common causes of hypothyroidism include:??
? Hashimoto?s thyroiditis ? it is an autoimmune condition that causes inflammation of the thyroid gland.??
?Other types [inflammation of the thyroid] such as acute thyroiditis and postpartum thyroiditis.??
Hyperthyroidism??
Hyperthyroidism is described as the excessive production of thyroid hormone, a less common condition than hypothyroidism. Symptoms of hyperthyroidism usually relate to increased metabolism. In mild cases, there may not be apparent symptoms.??
Symptoms and signs of hyperthyroidism can include:??
? Tremor??
?Nervousness??
? Fast heart rate??
? Fatigue??
? Intolerance for heat??
? Increase in bowel movements??
? Increased sweating??
? Concentration problems??
? Unintentional weight loss??
Some of the most common causes of hyperthyroidism include:??
? Toxic multinodular goiter??
? Graves? disease??
? Thyroid nodules that overexpress thyroid hormone known as hot nodules.??
? Acute inflammation of the thyroid gland causes transient hyperthyroidism.??
Goiter??A goiter is described as the enlargement of the thyroid gland, regardless of a cause. A goiter is not a specific disease. A goiter may be associated with hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism or normal thyroid function.??
?
Thyroid nodules??
Nodules are lumps or abnormal masses within the thyroid. Nodules can be caused by benign cysts, benign tumors or by cancers of the thyroid. Nodules may be single or multiple and can vary in size. If nodules are excessively large, they may cause symptoms related to compression of nearby structures.??
Thyroid cancer??
Thyroid cancer is far more common among adult women than men or youth. About 2/3 of cases occur in people under age 55. There are different kinds of thyroid cancers, depending upon the specific cell type within the thyroid that has become cancerous. Most cases of thyroid cancer have a good prognosis and high survival rates, especially when diagnosed early.??
Treatment?
This can be treated by medication or surgery. The treatment will depend on the particular disease of the thyroid.??
Medications
Medications can be given to replace the missing thyroid hormone in hypothyroidism. Synthetic thyroid hormone is given in pill form by mouth. When hyperthyroidism is present, medications can be used to decrease production of thyroid hormone or prevent its release from the gland. Other medications can be given to help manage the symptoms or hyperthyroidism, such as increased heart rate.? If hyperthyroidism is not controlled by medications, radioactive ablation can be performed. Ablation involves giving doses of iodine labeled with radioactivity that selectively destroys the thyroid tissue.?
?
Surgery
This can be used to remove large goiter or a hyper functioning nodule within the gland. Surgery is necessary when there is a possibility of thyroid cancer. If the thyroid gland is removed entirely, the individual will need to take synthetic thyroid hormone for life.??
Thyroid surgery can also be used in Graves? Disease and was the treatment of choice prior to RAI therapy and anti-thyroid medications.? ?
The viewpoint for thyroid disorders
In most circumstances, thyroid disorders can be well managed with medical treatment and are not life threatening. Some conditions may require surgery. The outlook for most people with thyroid cancer is also good. However, patients whose thyroid cancer has spread throughout the body may have a poorer prognosis.? ? ?

The centre, the periphery and the corpse
	
The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), now in its third or fourth month, is no longer a third force. The numbers, the percentages and the seats won should convince anyone with a modicum of political sense that it has gone beyond being just an alternative party, a feat considering that the JVP has strived hard to transcend the limits of being such an alternative for more than two decades with no notable success. It?s a populist wave we?re seeing here, and like all populist waves the momentum, while intermittent when accounting for the long term, can be spoiled, improved on, or sustained depending on whether the primary tenets of the party are adhered to. Those who voted for the Pohottuwa were, by default and for the most, voting for a Rajapaksa Restoration. Naturally, they were by no means dim enough to think that the LG elections would be enough for such a restoration to occur anytime soon.??
The SLPP won a mandate at the grassroots level, but that mandate does not and will not transcend the larger mandate given by the people on January 8, 2015. These two mandates are now interlocked, and will for a long time be pitted against one another owing to the fact that those elected from the Pohottuwa to the LG bodies will have to depend on, and fight with, those elected from the UNP and the anti-Rajapaksa UPFA in the Central Government for the mobilisation of funds. Those who voted for the SLPP, even those who may not have been aware of this, hence voted not because they wanted Rajapaksa to seize power, but because they wanted to create a mess.??
Whether or not the mess created was enough for them to claim bragging rights (after all, even with that momentum, they still were not able to clinch a majority in the local government bodies) is grist for another debate. What?s important to note here is that the SLPP did not come to power at the grassroots level with the intention of claiming power from the centre. Logically this means that any attempt at claiming power from that centre has to be seen as being antithetical to the larger motives of the Pohottuwa Brigade, since the fact that they don?t have the necessary numbers in parliament implies that for such an attempt to work out, they have to cohabit with a mainstream party; a pro-Rajapaksa SLFP. That will be seen, by the SLPP voter, as a betrayal of his vote. And why? Because cohabitation at this juncture means a betrayal of the principles on which the Pohottuwa Brigade was founded and mobilised.??
The SLPP won a mandate at the grassroots level, but that mandate does not and will not transcend the larger mandate given by the people on January 8, 2015
At the time of writing this article I could conceive three contingencies in the political sphere; the continuation of the Unity Government; an absolute UNP government, with the SLFP and UPFA relegated to the Opposition and a broader alliance between the SLFP-UPFA and the SLPP. It?s interesting to note that none of these contingencies and possibilities bodes well for the President; the continuation of the Unity Government will be seen by his supporters, from the party he leads, as a further excuse to try and oust him from the Chairmanship of that party. A UNP government will only bolster that excuse further and any marriage between the SLFP-UPFA and SLPP would mean, as one website memorably puts it, the ?path to self-destruction?, since it enables a Rajapaksa Restoration. Ostensibly the UNP has opted for the first of these, but marriages of expedience don?t last long; we may hence see the second contingency materialising eventually. This is what the Pohottuwa wants.??
So why is the SLPP engaged in power politics to the extent that they are sending us the message that they are ready to cohabit with the UPFA if that?s what it will take to topple the UNP? Has there been enough evidence that the sole cause for this country?s problems and ills, in the past three years, is the UNP? By itself, it is still a party to reckon with, not because it?s a party of angels but because it has shown itself to be a party of rationality (never mind the occasional unfortunate outbursts from its MPs). The Bond Scam was the cause of its shrinkage at the local polls, yes, but even accounting for this one can coherently make the case that the shrinkage of the government (SLFP + UPFA + UNP) had more to do with the SLFP?s wildly erratic behaviour than anything else. Those who were baying for Ranil Wickremesinghe?s blood would have been shocked, not surprisingly, when on Friday he gave probably the coolest, most self-assured news conference one could have expected from him under the circumstances. Nothing has been seriously ruptured, in other words: the President can?t remove the UNP and the UNP can?t remove Ranil.? The SLPP mandate was not, repeat NOT, to topple the present government. Regardless of what veterans of the calibre of Vasudeva Nanayakkara and Dinesh Gunawardena can and will say, the mandate given by the people on January 8, 2015 has not expired by any stretch of the imagination. Two more years exist, two years which the government can continue to play ball with or which the government can efficiently use to deliver on the promises that got them that mandate in the first place. The SLPP?s first move was to establish itself as a veritable alternative, a watchdog if you will, over the abuse and misuse of power at the centre, if at all because no such watchdog existed; not the official opposition under the TNA, or the forever-ranting-against-you-and-me opposition under the JVP. Neither of these parties had what it took to go beyond communalism (TNA) and class-conscious thrust (JVP) that they stand for. A more multifarious, across the board movement was needed at this juncture. This was the Pohottuwa.??
Does that mean that the Rajapaksa Cabal has no real power? Perhaps. Local governments have to depend, as I pointed out, on the central government. But in terms of grassroots mobilisation, in terms of the number of seats won and the mayors and chairmen to be appointed, I think we can safely say that the SLPP is here to stay, for quite some time. The first step towards sustaining the momentum that drove it, is to stick to the manifesto it rode on. That momentum does not enable its members to topple the government, nor does it enable them to cohabit with a section thereof in the hopes of toppling it in the future. What it does enable them to do, though, is to stand apart on its own and watch the mess that the present regime has created, because of its own internal failings and contradictions, continue and if at the 11th hour a saviour is needed, present a Rajapaksa sibling or progeny to come and save the day. Personally speaking, I don?t entertain such illusions with respect to this whole Rajapaksa Restoration campaign, but it?s the most feasible option that the SLPP has as of now.??
?
To enable that option, to ride into the sunset triumphantly with that option, however, the Podujana Peramuna must abide by the licence that the people gave them. Of the aforementioned three political contingencies, then, the most beneficial to them will have to be Contingency Number One: The continuation of the Unity Government. If their aversion to the UNP (their traditional enemy) transcends their desire to stick to their mandate this way, it can only mean one thing: Mahinda Rajapaksa is so power-hungry, so grasping, that his cabal is ready to commit everything and anything under the sun for the sake of temporary power, be it in the form of a coalition or a caretaker government.??
Reliable sources tell us that Mahinda has refused to be a part of the government. If this is true, it can bode well not just for the SLPP, but also for their enemy. So the UNP has the centre, the Pohottuwa has the periphery, while the SLFP-UPFA has become what Gunadasa Amarasekara said it would eventually become, back in 2015: a ?kavandaya?, or a headless corpse.??

The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf reopens its newly refurbished BIA store
	
Hon. Nimal Siripala De Silva - Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation
Colombo?s favourite tastemaker in coffee is now back at the Bandaranaike International Airport with a slicker, bolder and more contemporary look. Since it was first opened in 2006, The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf?s airport store has been the first and longest running international franchise at the BIA.?
The airport store embodies the CBTL philosophy of a home away from home - comfort and familiarity no matter where you go in the world. The franchise is one of the world?s most well-known brands, easily recognized by customers for its distinctive purple and white design. The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf first opened in 1963 in Hollywood, Los Angeles. Ten years later, the Airport ?Bean? served its 3 millionth customer. The Coffee Bean remains the quintessential Hollywood brand- every celebrity has been snapped with a familiar CBTL takeaway cup in their hand. The Coffee Bean is known for its legendary Ice Blended range, concocted by a barista during an exceptionally hot summer in 1987 long before the advent of the frappuccino. Today, over three million customers walk into Coffee Bean stores around the world every day.?
In Sri Lanka, the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf was one of the very first coffee chains to identify Colombo?s promise as the urban hotspot it would become post-war. The flagship Maitland Crescent branch opened in 2007 and it has remained open through some of the country?s most intensely turbulent times. ?We remained committed to Sri Lanka because Sri Lanka was committed to us,? says Roman Scott-Chairman of The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, a subsidiary of the Calamander Group. ?We were the first international brand to come into Sri Lanka during the last stages of the war and although the times have changed for the better, our customer base remains as loyal as ever-exactly in proportion to the quality of product and service we?ve maintained since then.?
Hon. John Amaratunga - Minister of Tourism and Christian Religious Affairs
The airport store reopens with a modern contemporary aesthetic. The new Coffee Bean design replaces the old darker wood with a brighter and slicker new California vibe. More grab and go food and beverages are available at the outlet. A more efficient layout has created more seating capacity and a larger kitchen with a full walk in chiller facility, ready to drum up an exciting and extensive variety of food and beverages.?
The official opening of the refurbished airport store on 20th February was attended by Chief Guest Hon Nimal Siripala De Silva - Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, Guest of Hon. John Amaratunga - Minister of Tourism and Christian Religious Affairs, Saman Ediriweera - Chairman of Aviation Services Sri Lanka, Ranjith De Silva - Vice Chairman of Airport & Aviation Services Sri Lanka, Jeff Goonewardena - Director of Airport & Aviation Services Sri Lanka and The Chairman of The Calamander Goup Inc, Roman Scott.

Trump wants teachers in the US to be armed
	
?
At first, the hour-long President Trump meeting with students who survived last week?s Florida school shooting appeared to be an open discussion about ways to stop the killing. In Europe, it reminded some stakeholders of how they first began to brainstorm ideas, following a devastating string of school shootings here between 2002 and 2009.??
?Does anyone have any idea of how to stop it?,? Trump asked, after survivors and advocates had delivered powerful testimonies at the White House event that was broadcast live.??
But the search for ?any idea? that could stop the shootings quickly led to a familiar proposal - and one that is extremely risky, according to those who have spent years successfully trying to prevent similar shootings in Europe on behalf of their governments. Trump did not make any conclusive promises at the end of the meeting, but as the conversation moved on he appeared to favour arming teachers themselves.??
Switzerland and Germany are among the leaders of an approach that was eventually also discussed during Trump?s White House meeting on Wednesday. Almost an hour into the meeting, one participant voiced skepticism of the idea to arm teachers.? ?I appreciate the point on arming teachers; it?s not something I personally support. Rather than arm them with a firearm, I would rather arm them with the knowledge on how to prevent these acts from happening in the first place. How do you identify the kids in your class that are most at risk?,? she said.??
?Whoever hopes that Trump will seriously restrict gun laws will likely be disappointed,? wrote Germany?s Der Spiegel magazine in a story published online. ?In fact, the opposite may happen. Apparently, Trump believes to be able to create more security at schools by adding more weapons,? Spiegel?s Washington correspondent summarized in disbelief, before citing NRA donations to Trump.

## Title: Ven. Soma Maha Thera of the Vajiraramaya He adorned all that he touched
## Section: News Features

Ven. Soma Maha Thera of the Vajiraramaya He adorned all that he touched
	
I pen these thoughts and reflections as a tribute to Ven. Soma Maha Thera of the Vajiraramaya on his 58th death anniversary.? ?He was born at Kotahena on December 23, 1898?to Catholic, Colombo Chetty parents, Emmanuel Marian Perera Pulle and Theresa Rodrigo Babapulle and at his baptism was given the name, Victor Emmanuel Perera Pulle.?
Rev. Soma Maha Thera was an erudite Buddhist scholar and a true disciple of the Buddha
He was the working bee in the Master?s hive and in His service, the very juice of the bitter thyme turned into honey at?his touch
He never spared himself and those who knew him, will remember him most for his humanity
? To my life-long regret, I never had the opportunity of meeting him but had the privilege of meeting his colleague and brother monk Rev. Kheminda Thera, who accompanied Rev. Soma to Burma, for their higher ordination in 1936, and wrote the ?In Memoriam?, which prefaced the marvellous piece of writing titled Vimuttimaga or The Path to Freedom, authored by Arahant Upatissa and translated from Chinese to English by Rev. N.R.M. Ehara, Rev. Soma Thera and Rev. Kheminda Thera.? ?
I remember, as a 13 or 14-year-old, listening to some of Rev. Soma Maha Thera?s sermons broadcast over the airwaves of the then Radio Ceylon though their depth, thrust and message were alien to me.? ?
As a youth and later as a Buddhist monk, Rev. Soma was known to have been a voracious reader, an independent thinker and a student of comparative religion, philosophy, art, archaeology, astrology and history.?
?
The story is told of how as a youth he had walked to Fort looking to buy a book for the rupee his mother had given him as pocket money. He had ended up buying an English translation of the Dhammapada, which served him as his introduction to the teachings of the Buddha. It led to his eager attendance at lectures and sermons on the Buddha Dhamma as he gradually moved away from the faith of his parents.? ?
?Aciram vat? ayam kayo pathvimadhisessati? ?
Chuddhoapetavinnao, niratthamvakalingaram.?? ?
?Truly it will not be long before this body lies in the earth, bereft of consciousness like a useless piece of wood; which is thrown away? -- Soma Thera?s translation in ?Words Leading to Disenchantment?, which was published in the Bosat, Oct. 1959.? ?
Often he was heard to say that this was the sort of death he preferred. He had passed away a few months later, on February 23, 1960 at the Vajiraramaya in Bambalapitiya, .? ?
I compiled these insights into the life and work of Rev. Soma Maha Thera from what his colleagues had written which were quoted in the, ?In Memoriam?.? ?
?It is fitting to record here the life and work of the Ven. Soma Maha Thera; but for his indomitable energy and earnestness, the translation of Vimuttimaga, would not have been undertaken, persisted in and completed in just four months. Whenever any difficulty arose it was to him that the others turned. When we were tempted to give up the work on encountering really hard patches, he was always ready with encouragement and with a way out of the difficulty. He loved to work hard, while half-hearted effort was unknown to him. Not infrequently he used to say, ?Better wear out than rust out,?? Rev. KhemindaThera wrote in the ?In Memoriam?.? ?
In 1920 Victor Perera Pulle had met Mr. W. Joseph Soysa, one of the founder members of the Servants of the Buddha, the well-known association which had its headquarters at Lauries Road, Bambalapitiya. After being actively engaged in the publication of the ?Blessing?, he and Mr. Soysa joined the Buddhist Union and later founded the Fort Study Circle and was elected its organizing secretary with Mr. W. Don Michael as joint secretary.? ?
The following are excerpts from Mr. Michael?s article titled, ?Apostle of the Dhamma?, written on the passing away of Ven. Soma Maha Thera:? ?
?The sudden death of Soma Thera has uprooted from our midst a personality distinguished at once by the versatility of his talents, self-sacrifice, personal sanctity and crusading apostleship of the Dhamma. A deep understanding of human nature and the human problem of suffering had mellowed him and bred in him, in an unusual degree, qualities of tolerance, patience, restraint and sympathy with fellow-beings. Opposition and frustration left in him no sense of defeat or bitterness. He was the working bee in the Master?s hive and in His service, the very juice of the bitter thyme turned into honey at his touch. No wonder that, in the Augustan age of Buddhist renaissance in Ceylon, Soma Thera was considered to represent the fine flower of Buddhist culture. He shed his fragrance wherever he moved. As scholar, preacher, organizer, monk and friend it may be aptly said of him: Nihil tetigit quod non ornavit,? which translated into English reads, ?He touched nothing that he did not fail to adorn?.
?These sterling qualities of Soma Thera were happily blended in a character in which humility and service formed the keynote. He never spared himself. He gave till it hurt. Overwork and fatigue were the proximate causes of the dire malady which struck down the mighty oak of the Dhamma. Today a void is left standing which may take years to fill.?? ?
The following are excerpts from an article written by the then Ceylon?s Director of Education, S.F. de Silva: ?I came to know Ven. Soma Thera as Mr. Victor Pulle some 30 years ago. My first impression was of a remarkably earnest man who was determined to seek and find out the truth. His face was an index to his earnestness and I often listened to him arguing a point. We became very good friends and week in and week out I used to watch and realize that of the band that gathered together, he was the most untiring in his study of the Dhamma. As a member of the Order he became a changed man. I noticed strength of character and calmness of demeanour in everything he said and wrote. I used to visit him in his room and talk things over many an evening. Occasionally the eye would flash and I could see the old-time fighter but there was an unmistakable sense of toleration of others and a remarkable kindliness in everything he said. The Ven. Soma Maha Thera was very well known to English-speaking audiences in the Island. Many may remember his thoughtful talks over Radio Ceylon. To me his translation, editing and notes of the Satipatthana Sutta are characteristic of the man. I miss him very much as a friend but those who knew him have no cause to grieve for a life that had been so nobly spent. His life is an example to all those who knew him, that there is nothing nobler for a Buddhist than to live the life that the Buddha has preached, to walk the way He had walked and to follow Him on the Noble Quest.?? ?There is so much more to say but little space to say it in and reluctantly though, I conclude my tribute to Rev. Soma Maha Thera with excerpts from an article written by Mr. Ananda Pereira, the then President of the Servants of the Buddha. It was published on February 27, 1960, three days after he passed away.? ?
?With the death of Ven. Soma Thera, Sri Lanka loses one of her noblest sons. Born of Roman Catholic parents on December 23, 1898, duly baptized and brought up in the faith of his parents, the youthful Victor Pulle began asking questions ? deep, simple, direct questions ? the answers to which as given by his parents and spiritual advisers did not satisfy him. His inquires in due course led him to Buddhism, where at last he found the answers or at least the hope of satisfactory answers to his questions. He plunged into the study of the Buddha Dhamma and laid the foundation of that sure grasp of the Teachings that served him so well in later years as a missionary. Never one to be satisfied with half measures, he was ordained as a Bhikku in 1936. From the day he joined the Sangha he adorned it. As scholar, translator, writer, preacher and missionary, he strove mightily in the Buddhist cause. He never spared himself and those who knew him, will remember him most for his humanity. His was not the cold way of the anaemic academician. He lived his Buddhism with every beat of his warm and generous heart. Sometimes he seemed impulsive, sometimes even a shade pugnacious, but never, never, did he say nor do a mean, false, or deliberately unkind thing. He lived here a while and has moved on, strong and assured, brave and smiling, kind, gentle and untiring. We too must fare onward when our time comes. We shall meet again.?? ?
Rev. Soma Maha Thera was an erudite Buddhist scholar and a true disciple of the Buddha. He taught and preached the Buddha Dhamma and lived a life shaped by its principles. Truly it could be said of him that he not only talked the talk but also assiduously walked the talk and to echo what Mr. Don Michael wrote of him, ?He touched nothing that he did not fail to adorn?.? ?
May you have attained the supreme happiness of Nibbana.? ?
Note: Ven. Soma Maha Thera and the writer?s mother were first cousins and the photograph that accompanies this article was given to the writer by?Mr. Joseph Soysa?s brother.
