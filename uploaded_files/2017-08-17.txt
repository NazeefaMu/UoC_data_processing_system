A conglomeration of  canvas creativity
	
?Beyond the Water Margin?\- A group?water colour exhibition?
?The artist is a receptacle for emotions that come from all over the place, from the sky, from the earth, from a scrap of paper, from a passing shape, from a spider?s web? were the words of Pablo Picasso, one of the greatest painters to have ever lived. An artist?s creation holds the mystic power in adding colour to life and getting rid of the bland black and white that makes an individual?s life monotonous. ?Beyond the Water Margin? is ready to accomplish just that by painting colour into the soul and make life bubble to the surface through an expressive and unique collection of artistic creations. ??
?Beyond the Water Margin?, a group water colour exhibition, will be inaugurated on August 18 at the Lionel Wendt Art Centre as the clock strikes 6 in the evening. The exhibition will be open to art lovers among the general public from August 19 to 21 from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. ?
The exhibition stands as the fruit borne to the tree of creative endeavour of four professional artists, representing four different eras in Sri Lankan water colour art. The skilled pairs of hands behind the masterpieces that will be on display at the exhibition belong to artists Gunasiri Kolambage, Basil Cooray, Sanjeewee Senevirathna and Nilusha Weerakkody. ?
?Beyond the Water Margin?, a group water colour exhibition, will be inaugurated on?August 18?at the Lionel Wendt Art Centre as the clock strikes?6 in the evening. The exhibition will be open to art lovers among the general public from August 19 to 21 from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.
A Character Portfolio ?
Gunasiri Kolambage is deemed as one of the few artists who belongs to the era when the Sri Lankan water colour trend first sprouted into existence. His painting styles unfold a fusion of European and Indian traditions. He is recognized as the pioneer in Sri Lankan abstract water colour art, with his most matured work being influenced by artists such as Stanley Abeysinghe, H.B. Perera, G.S Fernando and Susil Premaratna. His source of inspiration has been the simple lifestyle, recommended through Buddhist teachings, he leads. ??
Basil Cooray, a descendant of the second era of the water colour trend, follows his own independent and unique style. Scenes of humanity, folk lifestyle and rural life are brought to life on white space envisioned through his artistic eye. Basil?s art gives priority to sentimentalism over symbolism. ?
Sanjeewee Senevirathna belongs to the era where two Sri Lankan water colour trends existed. His earlier work took on a blend of second and fourth water colour eras which later developed under the influence of modern trends from the European and Asian regions, bee-lining towards artistic maturity and a unique identity. Modern Sri Lankan water colour trends mingled into existence with Sanjeewee?s work in 2010. Sanjeewee has explicated a Sri Lankan identity internationally, having emerged victorious in numerous water colour contests, both contemporary and international. ??
The local identity or cultural adherence never stood in the way of Nilusha Weerakkody in finding the subject in art. The artist is focused on expressing his creativity. His work connected to environmental, material and humane activities, fantasizes about worldly pleasures, sensuous and warm colour schemes, which is free to be grasped with an open mind. ?
Artistic perspective ?
The event organizer for ?Beyond the Water Margin?, artist Sanjeewee Senevirathna, aired his views regarding the trends in water colour painting. ?
According to Sanjeewee Senevirathna, water colour paintings are done using various styles. ?Water colour painting came into existence in the 18th century. From the start it had its own culture building up and it expanded worldwide. Water colour painting has spread in to different paths which include materials and equipment, exhibitions and contents, demonstrations, printed and e-publications, watercolour societies, current conversations, workshops, water colour academies and water colour museums etc,?he said.
Senevirathna compared the spread of water colour art in Asia in comparison to Europe. He stated that though it?s generally considered that water colour art originated in Europe, the basic foundation to this art sprouted from the great Asian art culture, mainly from china and Japan. ?While China discovered paper, the use of water soluble ink to draw on paper originated from both these countries. For the purpose of drawing, they created their own calligraphy brushes using soft hairs of animals. In Europe the only difference made was the modification of these techniques. So Asian and European artwork expressed differences in their own unique ways. The styles of water colour artwork coming from European, Latin American and Australian continents fall under the category of European artwork while the styles followed by Asian artwork come from countries like China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Taiwan and Malaysia,? he explained. By comparing the art work of artists from Europe such as Joseph Zbukvic, Alvaro Castagnet, Mary Whyte and Asian artists such as Guan Weixing, Liu Yi and DirekKingnok, the uniqueness of these styles surfaces clearly. ?
Many consider the water colour medium to be difficult. But Senevirathna accentuated that something being hard or easy depends on the person?s interest for that particular subject. ?I never felt that water colour art was hard. But unlike other art media, like oil painting and acrylics- where the drawings can be altered even after the final result- the final drawing can?t be altered in the water colours medium,? he added. Senevirathna supported his point by quoting an Indian water colour artist who once said: ?Painting with water colours is like shooting an arrow. Once shot, it can?t be brought back.? ?
Senevirathna expressed his thoughts on the identity and uniqueness of the modern Sri Lankan artist. ?The decision we have taken as artists to remain in the water colour field, selling our artwork in the art market, fulfilling the requirements of museum owners, using rare and easily available raw materials in creating artwork- all the while attempting to minimize expenses -involves risk. But we still work for what we feel has to be done within the frameworks of our identity,?he explained.?
No matter how much water colour art has expanded worldwide, modern Sri Lankan artists don?t show partiality towards water colours. Senevirathna envisions it as a question of one?s identity, expression and interest. ?The opportunities for new artists to analyze the water colour medium is very low in the country. It?s important to analyze how the medium is used internationally. Art creations at international level explicit professionalism through which the medium?s uniqueness has been preserved,? Senevirathna added. He further stressed that Sri Lankan artists require an intellectual stubbornness to reach that level?of competency.
Through ?Beyond the water margin?, admirers of artwork will be able to observe a collection of different and unique artwork by four Sri Lankan artists representing four different eras of water colour art. Senevirathna stated that this will be the first time that the attendees will be able to witness a variety of different and unique paintings under different concepts and themes inside one gallery. ?The public has an open opportunity to observe and appreciate various ideas and concepts through art creations under one roof,?he stressed.?
In water colour paintings,it is said that a message hidden beneath the exterior beauty is conveyed. Senevirathna pointed out that any artist despite the difference in medium, works with concepts unique to them. ?If an artist works out of this context, then the creation will only be materialistic. It will be a lifeless creation without a soul. Artists differ by individualistic concepts and themes, brought to life on the canvas. Surpassing the exterior splendour of the artwork, there should be a hidden message for the observer to perceive,? he said. Senevirathna also said that an observer initially gets drawn to a painting for its external beauty. But then they are prompted to move towards the meaning hidden behind the art. This he stated is something special about water colour artwork. ??
The decision we have taken as artists to remain in the water colour field, selling our artwork in the art market, fulfilling the requirements of museum owners, using rare and easily available raw materials in creating artwork- all the while attempting to minimize expenses -involves risk
The four talented artists maintain connections through the exhibitions held by International Water colour Society (IWS), which is sure to make its impacts on Sri Lankan water colour art. Senevirathna addressed its influences. ?IWS is the largest water colour society with branches in 85 countries. The main person-in-charge of each branch is referred to as the country head. As the Country Head of the IWS branch in our country, it?s my responsibility to create interest in water colour paintings at a national level. I also have to engage Sri Lankan artists in international IWS activities. IWS provides a great foundation for local artists and creates an opening for them to enter the global world of art. My fellow artists and I participate in international exhibitions and contests held by IWS,? he said. Senevirathna invites all amateur and professional artists to make links with IWS Sri Lanka through the official facebook page. ?I am happy to note that among the limited number of local artists who use the medium of water colours, the majority of them have joined hands with us,?he concluded.?

Britain seeks Brexit without borders for Northern Ireland
	
?
REUTERS, 16 August, 2017-Britain has said there should be no border posts or immigration checks between Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland after Brexit, in a paper that attempts to resolve one of the most complex aspects of its departure from the European Union. ?
Some 30,000 people cross the 500-km (300-mile) border every day without customs or immigration controls; negotiators must work out new arrangements without inflaming tensions in a region that suffered decades of bloody turmoil before a peace deal in 1998. ?
Wednesday?s publication drew heavily on those proposals as a solution for Northern Ireland that would not involve ?physical border infrastructure and border posts?, or electronic surveillance. Reaching agreement with the EU on this was top of Britain?s list of Brexit priorities, the government said. ?
The aim is ?to find a practical solution that recognizes the unique economic, social and cultural context of the land border with Ireland, without creating any new obstacles to trade within the UK,? Northern Ireland minister James Brokenshire said. ?

Child dies of choking inside vehicle
	
I.L.R. Lafir and Thasmiya were proud parents of two children. The eldest was a 11-year-old daughter and a son who was 5 years old. They were residents of Oluwil, Akkaraipattu in the Ampara District.
It was on August 7 Monday (Poya Day) that the son had left home at about 1.30 pm saying that he was going to a nearby boutique. As there was an undue delay in his coming home, the parents went in search of the child. ??
Even after a couple of hours they were unable to find any clues about his whereabouts. The parents with the help of the neighbours searched for their son but were unsuccessful. ??
The parents were shocked as to what had happened to the child. This loss of the child spread all over the village in Oluwil and no information was found about him for many hours despite telephone calls given to all in the neighbourhood and to their kith and kin. ??
People in the village came to various conclusions: He may have been kidnapped by somebody or he may have gone for a walk with an outsider. In spite of the fact that various views were expressed by the people in the area, the whole village was shocked as he was not found by their parents. ??
By 5.30 pm the news spread all over the village that the concerned child was found inside a motor vehicle near their house. The child was found dead inside the vehicle. The people began to express various views in this regard. ??
The news spread all over the village that the concerned child was found inside a motor vehicle near their house
A person called Buhari who is employed in the Eastern University as a person in-charge of discipline had his house situated in close proximity to the house of the parents of the child. He was engaged in domestic activities while his car had been parked opposite his house. When he opened the front door of his car at about 5.30 pm on this fateful day, he was shocked at the sight of a small child lying below the front seat. As he had already got the information about the missing child, he made arrangements to admit the child to the Akkaraipattu hospital with the assistance of the neighbours. By that time, everything had happened. The child who had been inside the vehicle for more than five hours had breathed his last. ??
Later, the Akkaraipattu hospital had informed the Akkaraipattu Police about this incident and the Police OIC Chief Inspector, Saman Kumara had informed the incident to DIG Nuwan Wedasinghe and subsequently to SP and OIC of Ampara Division Samantha Wijesekera. With the directions of the above officers, investigations had been launched into this incident by the Chief Inspector Saman Kumara. Later, the crime investigations officers of the Ampara Police had commenced investigations. When these officers had checked the vehicle, they had found some accessories in front of the vehicle missing. The air freshener used for the vehicle had been detached and the Police found it difficult to find out the reason for this death. ??
This type of tragedy could happen when children are left behind to while away time on their own
The Akkaraipattu Acting Magistrate who came to the spot ordered the Police to hold the post mortem examination. As the Judicial Medical Officer of Akkaraipattu general hospital was on leave, the Police Officers intervened and made arrangements to bring the Judicial Medical Officer A. Ilangowan from Colombo to hold the post mortem examination. He had returned a verdict of a death caused due to choking. Some body parts of this child had been sent to the Government Analyst for further investigations. Accordingly, it is expected that the real cause of his death will be revealed in due course. ??
This type of tragedy could happen when children are left behind to while away time on their own. This tragedy had taken place when the child had been sent to a boutique alone. It has been revealed at the Police investigations that this child had a great liking to vehicles. According to a witness, the child was unable to come out of the vehicle when he entered it because the door of the vehicle had become automatically locked. However, sending children alone for various purposes generally ended up in a tragedy. ??
Further investigations were being carried out by a team of Police officers including the officers of the Crime Investigations Division with the instructions of the DIG Nuwan Wedasinghe on the directions of Ampara Division OIC SP Samantha Wijesekera. ??
In a society created on the influence of science and technology, man-made tragedies seem to be worse than natural disasters. The main reason is the carelessness and the negligence of man. These tragedies can be averted by man himself. May wiser counsel prevail. ??

Concerns over a costly conundrum
	
As the half-year mark passes us the public continues to be dissatisfied with the rise in the prices of utilities, products and taxes etc. The Daily Mirror not only spoke to various sections of the public to obtain their opinions on the rising cost of living, but also to academics. We learned that both the professionals and the public foresee a continuous rise in costs and hope that a better solution will be offered regarding this issue.?
?The Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) and the new National Consumer Price Index (NCPI) are the two main price indices used to measure cost of living in Sri Lanka. At present we use the CCPI for which the base year is 2013=100, whereas earlier we used CCPI for which the base year was 2006/7 = 100,?explained Fernando. ?
He further stated that according to the CCPI Sri Lanka?s annual average inflation rate has increased in the past couple of years. ?According to the new CCPI our rate of inflation in 2015 on annual average was 2.2%, and it increased to 4% in 2016. In 2017 we expect it to increase up to 6% which shows us that during the past 3 years our cost of living has increased from 2% to 6%,? he added.
At present we use the CCPI for which the base year is 2013=100, whereas earlier we used CCPI for which the base year was 2006/7 = 100,?
	An average household representing the entire country spends 44% of the total expenditure on food
	In November, the Government tax changes were reintroduced. Food prices were also on the rise partly due to a drought.
He continued to speak about the NCPI and other factors that affect the inflation rates.?The Census and Statistics Department introduced a new price index which is called NCPI where the base year is also 2013=100. An average household representing the entire country spends 44% of the total expenditure on food. Through this index the rate of inflation for the year 2015 is 3.8% and in 2016 it increased up to 4%. Furthermore we expect that this year?s average annual inflation rate will be nearly 6%. That means that according to the new index the cost of living gradually increases from 4% to 6%.
The NCPI and CCPI statistics on inflation marked an increase in May and June 2016 due to the impact of the increase in food prices. This increase was caused by adverse weather conditions and the increase in non-food prices resulting from the changes in government taxes. In July and August 2016, year on year inflation moved on an overall decelerated trend supported by some improvements in the supply conditions of food items. In November, the Government tax changes were reintroduced. Food prices were also on the rise partly due to a drought. This trend may continue further in some areas of the country,? said Fernando. ?
A tight monetary policy means the increase in policy rates and statutory reserve ratio, thus the Central Bank has been advised to continue the tight monetary policy further
Speaking about the impact of the increase in inflation, Fernando said, ?The increase in the inflation rate can affect many sectors in the economy, the first one being decreasing the real income of the people. This amounts to a fall in the purchasing power of the consumers. The second one is that it affects interest rates, which is why our interest rates from 2016 up to now are increasing gradually.
The Central Bank increases its policy rates, which include Standing Deposit Facility Rates (SDFR) and Standing Lending Facility Rates (SLFR). SDFR increased from 6% to 7.25% and SLFR increased from 7.5% to 8.75%, which means that our interest rates are also increasing because of our high inflation. When the interest increases it?s good for the depositors or savers, but it badly affects the borrowers. The borrowers borrow a very limited quantity which can affect the economic growth badly.
That is why since 2015 up to now the average rate of economic growth is only 4% to 5% whereas earlier, in 2010, 2011 and 2012 the growth rate was above 8%. Thirdly, it affects the Government Budget. The Government Budget deficit in 2016 was 5.4%, but this year it has increased much more than that due to inflation. In addition to that the increase in the rate of inflation affects our foreign sector. As a result of inflation our cost of production is high. Therefore our export prices also increase which results in a drop in export competitiveness. As a result our exports reduce and our exchange rate will also depreciate. From the perspective of workers, the high inflation adversely affects the real wages-which is the purchasing power of goods and services,? he explained. ?
Fernando went on to say, ?When the budget deficit increases, they have to finance it by either increasing taxes or obtaining loans. Therefore they will have to increase taxes at the next budget to finance the high budget deficit. That is why the IMF is requesting the CBSL to tighten the monetary policy further. Since 2015 up to now the Central Bank implemented a tight monetary policy.
A tight monetary policy means the increase in policy rates and statutory reserve ratio, thus the Central Bank has been advised to continue the tight monetary policy further. But according to the Central Bank?s new monetary policy framework it is going to maintain price stability. The Central Bank has introduced a new concept which is inflationary targeting. By putting this concept in to practice the bank will try to maintain the inflation rates around 4% to 6% for 2017.
The bank will utilize this concept because the stable and predictable levels of inflation is conducive for forthcoming sustainable long term growth in a country. Therefore the Central Bank is highly focused on maintaining low levels of inflation around 4% to 6%. That is why we can expect that the average rate of inflation for this year to be 6% due to the cost push factors rather than the demand pull factors,?said Fernando.?
?
Speaking on the effects of the rise in cost of living on the society, Professor Amarasekera said,?Due to the high cost of living many social problems have cropped up among the people. Contrary to popular thinking, finding and obtaining food and drinks for oneself isn?t the biggest and only worry that arises among people when prices rise. People tend to face other problems such as losing out on opportunities because they lack the ability to follow through due to high costs.
Although they want to display their abilities they lose the incentive to do so. Furthermore they aren?t in a position where they have access to information on good opportunities. As a result their place in society is stagnant and this causes frustration. Because of their inability to spend on their wants along with catering to their needs, anger and jealousy along with the built up frustration make it difficult for them to work along with others even during the smallest of activities,?Prof. Amarasekera observed.?
He further said, ?When we consider the situation in our country we see that the Government is making a huge effort to reduce this rising cost of living. This effort includes reducing the prices of essential items and medicines. However, the people haven?t felt this reduction in prices. Even if the Government has taken these steps, because of the long standing economic ambitions, it?s difficult to reduce the rising cost of living if you don?t implement massive long-term programmes. The rising cost of living affects things like education causing people to drop out of schools and join protest groups. We have seen this happen during the past few days. In addition to this a large number of people have left the country causing a large deprivation in the culture of our society,?he said.?
?So far there is no welfare for the public.??
- Thilak Kumara (53) Kandy ?
Prices are only increasing. There is no sign of a decrease in prices. The Government says that foreign investors are investing in the country, indicating that this will result in the welfare of the citizens. However, so far, the public hasn?t received this welfare. The country isn?t developing either. Going back to the 1970s, things were cheap, but then people had no money. The country?s situation in the 1970s was way better. Japan crumbled after the atomic bomb attack, but look at how fast they have come up as a developed country. But so far our country isn?t progressing and the prices are also not going down.?
?It?s very hard to run a family?
- Ravi (60) Colombo?
? The prices are so bad. It?s very hard to run a family. The expenses of children with regard to schooling and everything else have to be balanced with the monthly wage. My occupation is in the marketing field. The Government is very unstable. Day by day, life gets difficult. I don?t think the prices of items will change for the better.?
?I voted in favour of this Govt., but now I regret that decision?
-Sandun Wijeratna (38) Colombo
? It?s difficult to survive with the existing high prices of items. I voted in favour of this Government, but now I regret that decision. I make a living by selling books, going from bus to bus. It?s quite hard to keep up with our lives due to everything being so costly. ?
?People don?t have money to bear expenses?
- Manula (22)?Anuradhapura
?It?s very hard to live these days. The people in our area do agriculture for a living. There has been no rain for about 6-7 months now in Anuradhapura, so it adds to the burden. People don?t have money to bear expenses. The Government and the weather are to blame.?
?We barely manage with our salaries.?
- Mala Weerasinghe (60) Wellawatta?
Expenses are very high. I earn my living as a seamstress. We barely manage with our salaries. It?s with difficulty that we make ends meet. No matter which Government assumes power, there will be no change in?the prices. ?
?
?Prices aren?t going to change for the betterment of the people.?
-Chamila?(39) Gampaha ??
Prices are very high. It?s hard to manage. My husband is an electrician. We survive on his earnings with great difficulty. Prices aren?t going to change for the betterment of?the people. ?
?
?It?s a struggle to survive?
- H.A. Nishantha?(40) Polonnaruwa ?
It?s pointless talking about the prices of items. They are indeed high. Whichever Government comes into power, the small people aren?t protected. The poor and middle classes suffer. We can?t even obtain loans from banks. I earn my living as a driver. Needless to say it?s a struggle to survive. ?
?It seems like the Govt. will keep on increasing the prices?
-M.Wijetunge?(49) Nittambuwa ?
There is nothing to question about. Prices are obviously high in comparison to the salaries. So how do we manage? It seems like the Government will keep on increasing the prices. ?
?
?How can we have a meal??
- D.M.T. ?Rathnawathie?(67) Hanguranketha
?It?s hard to live due to the cost of items, especially the prices of food. So how can we have a meal? We represent a society who does agriculture for a living. My family runs on my husband?s pension. It?s not enough to survive. ?
?
?
?
?Expenses are very heavy?
?-Milan Malaka?(30) Ibbagamuwa?
Expenses are very heavy. It is hard to bear. It?s useless talking about it. The country is in a bad state. I earn a living through my business, but of course it isn?t enough to survive because of the prices. ?

Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa said in the wake of the ?yamapalana? government's fraud and corruption coming to light in dramatic and unexpected ways, the government is engaged in a desperate attempt to divert attention by hauling his family members to the CID and the FCID.
In a statement issued today, he said three members of his family including his wife Shiranthi and their sons Yoshitha and Rohitha were questioned by the CID and FCID this week.
?For the first time, my youngest son Rohitha was also hauled before the FCID on Tuesday. What the people saw this week is a part of the 'yamapalana' propaganda offensive against me, my family and the entire opposition,? Mr. Rajapaksa said.
His statement is as follows:
"Three members of my family ? my wife Shiranthi Rajapaksa and our younger sons Yoshitha and Rohitha were questioned by the CID and FCID this week. My wife was asked why the colour of a jeep that had been made available by the Red Cross to her charity Siriliya Saviya in 2011 and used by the Presidential Secretariat had been changed. International NGOs make their vehicles available to local charities once their projects are over. My wife had told the CID that she knows nothing about the maintenance or repair of vehicles used by the Presidential Secretariat. On Wednesday, the CID obtained a statement from my son Yoshitha on the same matter. He had been asked whether he had given instructions to anyone to change the colour of this vehicle. To this Yohitha had replied in the negative and explained that the transport division of the presidential secretariat maintains the vehicles and gets them painted if necessary. He had been asked whether he had used this jeep as his back up vehicle to which he had replied that it is the PSD that assigns any available vehicle for his back up team and that he had no role in the matter.
For the first time, my youngest son Rohitha was also hauled before the FCID on Tuesday. He was asked whether he was a shareholder of ?Supreme Sat? which was the first Sri Lankan company to be involved in the launch of a communications satellite. Rohitha had explained that he does not hold any shares in Supreme Sat directly or indirectly and that he was a paid employee of that company with the designation of Technical Director from July 2012 to July 2014 after which he left to concentrate on higher studies. The FCID had thereupon wanted to know whether he had helped Supreme Sat to get their licences. Rohitha had explained that by the time he joined Supreme Sat in 2012, they had already acquired their licence and that he had been introduced to Supreme Sat by a Chinese businessman who had come to South Hampton University in England to recruit new graduates for his company.
South Hampton is the only University in Britain running a course in Space Systems Engineering. Seven students graduated in 2012 one of whom was Rohitha. The satellite that was launched in 2012 is owned by the Chinese government and Supreme Sat which is a Sri Lankan private sector entity has leased six of the 36 transponders on the satellite with a view to providing satellite communication services to Sri Lankan customers. I have been informed that the main investor in this company is a prominent Singaporean businessman.
What the people saw this week is a part of the yamapalana propaganda offensive against me, my family and the entire opposition. Members of my family are told to appear before various police units and the police plant the story in the media that this is to obtain statements about the Tajudeen matter. What is important to the yamapalana government are the media reports generated ? not the contents of the statements obtained. When my youngest son Rohitha was summoned by the FCID, pro-yamapalana websites claimed falsely that hundreds of millions of rupees of government money had been spent on sending a satellite into orbit. In actual fact, there was no involvement of the Sri Lankan government in this satellite services company at all. The CID and the FCID are with the government in this propaganda offensive. Last Wednesday, within minutes of Yoshitha having given his statement to the CID, a pro-yamapalana website posted a story about the questions that he is supposed to have been asked.
As the corruption of the yamapalana government comes to light in dramatic and unexpected ways, they are engaged in a desperate attempt to deflect public attention by hauling members of my family to the CID and FCID. The extent of the panic in the yamapalana government is evident in the shrill announcement that special courts will be established to hear cases involving the Rajapaksas. This is in complete violation of the constitutional provisions relating to the equality of all persons before the law and the presumption of innocence. Even if such a special court is set up, what is the evidence that can be placed before this court? The government claims that properties worth Rs. five billion belonging to members of my family had been seized by the state or courts of law. This is a complete falsehood.
No property belonging to any member of my family has been seized by the state or any court of law. What the government has been trying to do is to claim that properties belonging to other people actually belong to us, and in the process they have caused terrible harassment to certain individuals. No member of my family has been found to be in possession of liquid or fixed assets, the provenance of which cannot be explained. Every member of the public knows that the same cannot be said about Ministers of the yamapalana government. No previous government has harassed the families of opposition politicians in the manner of the present yamapalana government.

HSBC and IBM develop cognitive intelligence solution to digitise global trade
	
HSBC, the world?s leading trade finance bank, is working with IBM to develop a cognitive intelligence solutioncombining optical character recognition withadvanced roboticsto make global trade safer and more efficient for thousands of businesses.
HSBC?s Global Trade and Receivables Finance (GTRF) team facilitates over US$ 500 billion of documentary trade for customers every year, and in doing so must manually review and process up to 100 million pages of documents, ranging from invoices to packing lists and insurance certificates. ?The new solution uses IBM?s advanced analytics technology, including intelligent segmentation and text analytics, to identify, digitise and extract key data within these documents before feeding it into the bank?s transaction processing systems; boosting accuracy whilst freeing up staff for more value-adding activities.
?The average trade transaction requires 65 data fields to be extracted from 15 different documents, with 40 pages to be reviewed,? said Natalie Blyth, HSBC?s Global Head of GTRF. ?By digitising this process we will make transactions quicker and safer for both buyers and suppliers, leading our industry forwards, and we will reduce compliance risks through an enhanced ability to manage huge volumes of data.?
?The problem is how to capture semi-structured documents with highly variant content through an analogue process, and no-one has the perfect answer,? said Roger Welch, Industry (Financial) Expert and Solution Architect for IBM Analytics ECM practice. ?In our experience, no trade finance solution has come as far or done as much as this new solution.?
HSBC is currentlyusing the technology to analyse English-language import and export bills in several markets inAsia, Europe, the Americas and the MENA region.
The team aims to enhance the solution so it can read a wider range of documents and languages including French, Spanish and Chinese.?
?We are continuously investing in technologies that will improve the way we work for the benefit of our customers and our people,? said Natalie Blyth. ?HSBC wants to be the leading bank for innovation, and initiatives like this one are key to achieving our goal.?

I know my Maths: Laksman Yapa
	
Public Enterprise Development State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardana said today he knows his mathematics and he has served as a bank employee for 7 years before coming to politics and therefore, no one must try to teach him maths or figures of trillions or millions.
Minister Abeywardana said he still maintains that the Central Bank bond scam has caused a revenue loss of rupees one trillion to Sri Lanka in the next 30 years if remedial measures were not taken.
"I don't want to get advise from babes in politics," he stressed.
Responding to Daily Mirror at the SLFP weekly news conference yesterday at the party office on comments made by UNP District Parliamentarian Nalin Bandara that the figure quoted by Minister Abeywardana was incorrect and he must correct it. Minister Abeywardana said if no action was taken to mitigate the losses from the illegal bond deal, it may rise to Rs. one trillion in 30 years.
?I know what I say. I have been a minister for more than 20 years and have worked as a bank employee before entering politics. Therefore, no one must attempt to teach maths to me. I still say that it would be a colossal loss of revenue to the Treasury running to one trillion rupees in 30 years,? Minister Abeywardana said.
He commended President Maithripala Sirisena for appointing a Presidential Commission of Inquiry to probe the Central Bank bond scam and added if it was not done the fraud would have been swept under the carpet. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

JO to bring no-faith motion against Rajitha
	
The joint opposition today charged that a no-faith motion should be brought against Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne with regard to the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) issue.
Joint opposition member Prof. Tissa Vitharana told a news conference that Minister Senaratne had not solved the SAITM issue despite having the sole authority to do so.
?Minister Senaratne is responsible for the entire blunder which has taken place in the State universities and medical sector in the country with regard to the SAITM,? he added.
He said it was necessary to bring a no-faith motion against Minister Senaratne since he had failed to fulfil his responsibilities towards this issue. He also said that Minister Senaratne could have solved this issue by ordering the SAITM to follow the directions recommended by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).
Meanwhile, he said that several anti-SAITM forces had recently established a special committee on the same matter.
?This committee will meet President Maithripala Sirisena in the near future to discus on this issue,? he said.?(Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Let's hope the clouds don't get in the way!
	
A partial eclipse of the sun will be visible across the UK just before sunset on Monday - providing clouds do not get in the way.
The sun will resemble a biscuit with a bite out of it as part of the moon blocks out the sun's rays.
Providing the weather is fine on Monday, the rare solar eclipse should be visible at around 8pm, depending on where you are in the UK.
The moon will block out 10 per cent of the sun's diameter, and 2 per cent of its area, with dark sun spots speckling the sun's surface.
?
Starting around 7.30pm, the peak of the eclipse will be visible at around 8.04pm in London, at 7.58pm in Edinburgh and at 8.05pm in Cardiff. It should last around 40 minutes in total.
While only a partial eclipse in the UK, viewers in the United States will get to see a more impressive total solar eclipse.
The partial eclipse can only take place at New Moon, as this is when the Moon passes directly between the Earth and the Sun. (dailymail)

REUTERS, 16 August, 2017-Yemen suffered more airstrikes in the first half of this year than in the whole of 2016, increasing the number of civilian deaths and forcing more people to flee their homes, according to a report by international aid agencies. ?
The pace of clashes on the ground has also intensified this year, especially around Yemen?s third largest city, Taiz, which is besieged by the Iran-aligned Houthis, said the report. ?
The number of airstrikes in the first six months of 2017 totaled 5,676, according to the report by the Protection Cluster in Yemen, which is led by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), up from 3,936 for all 2016. ?
Average monthly clashes between the warring sides have increased by 56 percent from last year, the figures also showed. ?
The report did not identify any party as being responsible for the airstrikes, but the Saudi-led coalition backing Hadi has controlled Yemeni airspace since the war began in March 2015. ?

Phase two priority bus lane begins on August 22
	
Second phase of the priority bus lane project is scheduled to begin on August 22, the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry said.
Updating the media on the project yesterday, Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said the first day the new regulation had been implemented had yielded positive? results. ?We hope to see the project progress to greater heights by the end of the week,? he said.? ?
Elaborating details, the Minister explained that the project was only implemented in the morning at the moment as infrastructure was insufficient to implement it full scale. Road side shops and insufficient road space was pointed out as the main obstacle for these limitations.?
?Traffic in the morning is much worse than that experienced in the evening because both the office crowd and the school children step out at the same time. but this is not the case in the evening because half the crowd travels at a different time,? he said.?? Speaking of future plans for the project, Ranawaka said that roads would be widened to allow an additional lane for buses, a semi luxury bus service is to be introduced soon after to the lane and an additional lane is to be allocated for express bus services thereafter.
?Previously we assumed that prioritizing space for private vehicles would reduce the traffic congestion, but we have found that prioritizing the busses which is the cause of most of the traffic would help us reduce the congestion. The pilot project was held in Rajagiriya in May and that was quite successful even though we had some trouble on the first two days,? the Minister said.
Speaking of the cost of the project, Ranawaka said they had only spent on the road signs and the paint used to draw up the lanes. ?The cost would have been very high if we had brought in foreign experts for this. But we had the necessary backing of the local experts and we were able to complete this without spending too much funds,? he said.
Meanwhile, Senior Professor of the Department of Transport & Logistics Management, University of Moratuwa, Amal Kumarage who was also at the briefing said that according to a travel speed survey conducted by the University, 587 buses had travelled along the lane allocated for it during the three hours the project was in function.
?This is 200 busses per hour. The speed of the buses were about 22 kmph which is more than the normal speed experienced along these roads,? he said.
More than 23,000 passengers have used the public bus service, while 8,810 private vehicles have driven at the same time, the number of individuals using them was at 37,735, the Professor said.
?This means that only 35.2 percent have used buses as a mode of public transport that day, if this number was to increase the traffic congestion along this road will reduce. Therefore, we hope to increase these numbers in the future,? he said.
The project was a joint effort of the Police Traffic division, Sri Lanka Transport Board, Road Development authority (RDA), National Transport Commission, Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) and Road Passenger Transport Authority ? Western Province, Kumarage said.? (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Rajiv assassination: TN opposes premature release of SL convict
	
The Tamil Nadu government has opposed the plea for premature release of B Robert Payas, a Sri Lankan national, convicted in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case. This is? a departure from its proposal to set free all seven convicts in the case.
The state government opposed Payas' release in a counter affidavit filed in the court last week. A copy of it was served to the petitioner's counsel today.
The counter affidavit was in response to a petition by Payas and another convict in the case Jayakumar seeking their names to be included in the list of 180 prisoners proposed to be released prematurely in 2012 on Republic Day eve.
At the last hearing of the petition by the convicts on August 9, Justices A Selvam and Pon Kalaiarasan had directed the state government to file its counter affidavit by today while noting the "long pendency of the matter".
Accordingly, when the matter came up today, the counter affidavit by the Principal Home Secretary was handed over to the counsel for Payas.
In its affidavit, the government submitted Payas, according to his own admission, was a Sri Lankan national and hence his claim that his incarceration was violative of the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution of India was incorrect.
He was involved in the brutal assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in the run up to the Lok Sabha elections in May 1991 which had many political ramifications. It was definitely an important incident in the Indian political scene resulting in the stalling of the democratic process for a few days, it said.
An Advisory Board had in its September 18, 2009 report said the petitioner had rejected the petitioner's application for premature release.
The Judges posted the matter for further hearing on August 18.
The Centre's counter affidavit said Payas and Jayakumar were not entitled to premature release in view of the Supreme Court's ruling that life sentence meant imprisonment for the entire life of a person.
It also referred to the Tamil Nadu government's proposal to remit the life sentences and release of seven convicts, including the two petitioners, and said the Union government had challenged the (state's) decision in the Supreme Court where the matter was pending.
It said the apex court had on December 2, 2015 categorically held that in this matter the Union government was the appropriate authority to decide on remission of sentence as the case was investigated by the CBI, a central agency.(Outlook India)

Russian ex-minister accuses Putin?s lieutenant of framing him
	
?
Former Russian Economy Minister Alexei Ulyukayev told his bribery trial on Wednesday that he had been framed by a close lieutenant of President Vladimir Putin into accepting a payment of $2 million. ?
The accusation against Igor Sechin, head of Russia?s biggest oil company, thrust into the open simmering tensions between rival Kremlin clans - a spectacle rarely seen in public in the 17 years since Putin first became president. ?
Ulyukayev was detained on Nov. 14 last year, moments after Sechin personally handed him the cash in a late-night meeting that, according to prosecutors, was a sting to catch the minister in the act of accepting a bribe. ?
The case is politically charged because Sechin represents a powerful faction in the Kremlin who favour greater state control over the economy. They have clashed with economic liberals in the government, a group that included Ulyukayev. ?

SIA and CAE to establish flight training centre in Singapore
	
Singapore Airlines (SIA) and CAE Inc. have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to establish a joint venture for pilot training in Singapore.?
The joint venture will initially focus primarily on providing simulator training for Boeing aircraft types, supporting SIA Group airlines and other operators? pilot training needs in the region.
The equally-owned joint venture centre will operate out of the Singapore Airlines Training Centre (STC) located near Changi Airport. SIA will initially transfer four of its full-flight Boeing aircraft simulators to the venture, while additional CAE-built training equipment will be acquired progressively. The training facility will provide a full range of initial type rating and recurrent training programmes for Boeing 737 MAX, 747, 777 and 787 aircraft types.?
?The long-term prospects for the aviation sector are positive, and we are confident that the new flight training joint venture with CAE will further enhance Singapore?s position as a leading aviation hub. With the SIA Group expanding its fleet to drive additional growth, the joint venture will help keep pace with our own training requirements as well as those of other airlines in the region. This investment with CAE, one of the world?s leading civil aviation training organisations, is also in line with our push to drive revenue-generation from new adjacent businesses. Together with CAE?s expertise, we are positive that it will be a leading training facility for Boeing aircraft types in the Asia-Pacific region,? said Singapore Airlines CEO, Goh Choon Phong.
?Building on our relationship of more than 40 years, we are extremely honoured to join forces with Singapore Airlines and welcome this opportunity to leverage the strengths of our combined organisations to support the growing pilot training needs in the Asia-Pacific region ? one of the fastest growing markets in commercial aviation,? said CAE President and CEO Marc Parent.?
?This new joint venture will deliver best-in-class training, and will be an asset in supporting the growth of Singapore Airlines, one of the world?s premier carriers. CAE is dedicated to offering customers the most innovative training solutions to achieve the highest levels of safety and efficiency.?
The closing of the transaction is subject to execution of definitive transaction documents and customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. Subject to approvals, operations are expected to begin by the end of the year.

Suicide bombers kill 28 at camp for displaced people, 82 wounded
	
?
Three women suicide bombers blew themselves up at the entrance to a camp for displaced people in northeast Nigeria on Tuesday, killing 28 people and wounding 82, local sources said. The attack -- the latest in a string of assaults in the troubled region -- took place in the town of Mandarari, 25 kilometres (15 miles) from Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state, said Baba Kura, a member of a vigilante force set up to fight jihadists.
?Three female bombers triggered their explosive outside of the IDP (internally displaced persons) camp... killing 28 people and wounding 82 others,? Kura said. The first assailant blew herself up, triggering panic, Kura said.
?People were trying to close their shops when two other female bombers triggered their explosives, causing most of the casualties,? he said.
Ibrahim Liman, the head of a local anti-jihadist militia force, confirmed the details of the attack, and said that more than 80 injured had been taken to Maiduguri hospital.
A source at the hospital said a ?huge number? of patients had arrived.
Northeast Nigeria is a hotbed of activity by the Boko Haram jihadist group, involving shootings, bombings and kidnappings.
It launched an insurgency in 2009 that has killed about 20,000 people and displaced around 2.6 million others, creating one of the world?s biggest humanitarian crises.
Nearly two million are suffering from acute malnutrition, according to UN figures. After being elected to power in 2015, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari made tackling the insurgency a priority, winning back swathes of territory and declaring that Boko Haram is ?technically defeated?.
But this year has seen a surge in attacks, including an audacious assault on an oil exploration team that killed 69 people in Borno in July, raising fears that Boko Haram is regaining strength.
That attack prompted Vice President Yemi Osinbajo -- standing in for President Muhammadu Buhari who is on indefinite sick leave -- to tell the millitary to step up its response.
Osinbajo issued ?fresh directives... to immediately scale-up their efforts and activities in Borno state... to maintain a strong, effective control of the situation?, his spokesman Laolu Akandehe said.

The Meaning of  Bilateral
	
Remarks delivered on 14 August 2017 at the launch of?An Enduring Friendship. Sri Lanka and Pakistan? by Arshad Cassim, Editor Sinha Raja Tammita-Delgoda, Published by Institute of?
Strategic Studies, Islamabad, 2017. ?
In 2015 Former Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera told The Nikkei Asian Review that what Sri Lanka needed was an ?omnidirectional foreign policy,? a foreign policy which looks in all directions, that serves its own interests, not those of its neighbours, ?We don?t want to confine ourselves to one power bloc.?
This is very important. The foreign policy of any country, consists of strategies chosen by the state to safeguard its national interests and to achieve goals. They are and must be in the self interest of the nation. It is Sri Lanka?s self interest that we look in all directions, to paraphrase the Prime Minister of India, Mr. Narendra Modi, that we be ?Sri Lanka centric.? ?
Sri Lanka is part of South Asia. However,we must remember that South Asia is much more than India
	Although the bilateral relationship between Pakistan and Sri Lanka has been an important part of the South Asian landscape, it has yet to be comprehensively studied and evaluated
	A study of the?
	Pak-SL relationship is written by a young ?Lankan, designed and produced by SL,
	We have totally different cultures with utterly different world views and ways of life
Sri Lanka is part of South Asia. However,we must remember that South Asia is much more than India. It is Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Maldives, it is also Pakistan. ??
This is the sixth-most populous country in the world. In 2015 it had a population of 199.1 million, 2.57% of the world population. It is predicted that Pakistan will soon have the fourth largest population in the world, behind only India, China, and the United States. Like India, this is a huge and growing market on our very doorstep, one far too significant to ignore. ??
Today Pakistan is one of the world?s largest producers of natural commodities, in terms of purchasing power it is the 24th-largest economy in the world. Looking to the future, Pakistan is listed by Goldman Sachs as one of the Next Eleven (N-11), a group of eleven countries that, along with Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, have the potential to become one of the 21st century?s largest economies. In 2014 Goldman Sachs predicted that Pakistan?s economy would grow 15 times in the next 35 years and that by 2050 it would be the 18th-largest economy in the world. ??
The geographic location is also critical. Pakistan has a 650-mile coastline along the Arabian Sea, it borders Iran and shares a maritime border with Oman. In the far north east it offers direct access to China, the next economic superpower. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) the Network of road and railways that are currently underway throughout Pakistan will link China?s Xinjiang province to the port of Gwadar in southwestern Pakistan. This network also promises to make Pakistan the gateway to Central Asia, home of vast reserves of minerals and natural resources, oil, gas, gold, uranium and aluminium. CPEC offers Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan the opportunity to transport their goods and market them to regional and global markets. This could be the future, a future in which Sri Lanka could well share. This is an economic and political relationship that we must cement, for it is in our national self interest. ?
Although the bilateral relationship between Pakistan and Sri Lanka has been an important part of the South Asian landscape, it has yet to be comprehensively studied and evaluated. Mr. Arshad Cassim?s work is well researched and analytical; crisply argued and crisply written, it discusses the political, economic and defence aspects of the relationship. In a new departure, it also looks at the interaction between two peoples. ?
Books however are not just records of facts and figures. They are the beginning of a conversation. They also serve as tools of engagement, to help cement and solidify a relationship. A foundation on which to build, they provide stepping stones, forums for discussion, exchange and interaction. They also help to chart the future, ?We must not forget that Pakistan too is an Indian Ocean power. Looking into the future, Mr. Cassim touches on the potential of maritime trade and shipping. Oceans are still the highways of trade. Nearly 90 per cent of the world?s commodities, its goods and its raw materials still travel by sea. The future of both countries lies in the new deep water ports, Gwadar, in Baluchistan and Colombo and Hambantota in Sri Lanka. Gwadar is the pivot of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. It will be the link between China?s One Belt, One Road project, and the Maritime Silk Road. Who knows, it could be one of the hubs of the 21st century. ?
Former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has described Gwadar as a ?game-changer? for the region. It will provide China with direct access to the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean and enable Pakistan to establish an economic corridor to link directly with Kashgar and the markets of Central Asia. For Sri Lanka?s ports too, her trade and her shipping, this could a game changer. ?
This project presents a very interesting and imaginative exercise in soft power diplomacy. A study of the Pakistan-Sri Lanka relationship, sponsored by the government of Pakistan, it is written by a young Sri Lankan, designed by Sri Lankans, produced by Sri Lankans, even printed in Sri Lanka.?
This represents a massive vote of confidence and commitment to the bilateral relationship, truly bilateral in a way that many other bilateral relationships are not. Many other countries talk of bilateral relationships and then take unilateral action. This project represents the fulfilment of a long process, yet it was always one based on consultation and consensus. ??
SL is one of the oldest living cultures in the world, yet it is often made to feel like a junior partner, often told what to do, sometimes browbeaten, sometimes intimidated. This culture has a living heritage of 2,500 years, for the sake of our people we cannot afford to be anybody?s junior partner. Neither can we afford to think like one. Sri Lanka must have a Sri Lanka centric foreign policy, initiatives like this are an integral part of it. ?
American philosopher George Santayana?s great work, The Life of Reason (1905 -1906) is considered to be one of the most poetic and well-written works of philosophy in Western history. This is one of the sayings that we remember. ??
?Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.?
We, as Sri Lankans cannot and must not forget our past. Nor must we forget the part which Pakistan has played. Today many countries call themselves our friends. However, we must not forget Pakistan?s support for Sri Lanka during some of our most dangerous times. This proved a vital factor in the final defeat of terrorism. Maybe without Pakistan?s help we would not have come so far. We must also remember that in 2006 this willingness to help nearly cost the Pakistani ambassador his life. On 14 August the convoy carrying Pakistan?s High Commissioner, Bashir Wali Mohamed, was targeted by the LTTE. Although the High Commissioner escaped unhurt, several of his escort were killed. ?
This project has been in the making for almost three years, I would like to thank the Government of Pakistan and the High Commission of Pakistan in Sri Lanka, for recognizing the value of this initiative and taking it on.?
Their interest and support has enabled this project to reach fruition. A vital role was played by both the then High Commissioner for Pakistan in Sri Lanka, Major General. (Retd) Shakeel Hussain, and the acting High Commissioner Dr. Sarfraz Sipra, the officers and staff of the Embassy.?
Without their vision, their determination and their commitment in the face of many obstacles, this work would never have seen the light of day. ?
Pakistan and Sri Lanka. We are totally different cultures with utterly different world views and ways of life. Despite very real strains, this relationship has been characterized by restraint and sensitivity on both sides, something which has been sometimes missing from some of our other relationships. There is a lack of presumption on both sides, an ingrained reluctance to criticize or to dictate and a willingness to help at all times. In the short term and the long term, this relationship is in our strategic interest, one which we must not compromise or erode. ?
To safeguard the national interest, a nation must always have alternatives. When you have alternatives, you have choices. When you have choices, you have freedom. When you have freedom, you have independence. ??
Sir Muhammad Iqbal (1877 ?1938) is widely regarded as the Spiritual Father of Pakistan. A poet, philosopher and politician, he is also one of the most important figures in Urdu literature. These words are from his poem Knowledge and Religion.
A blossom cannot thrive in a meadow full of trees,
Unless some drops of dew ally with pleasant breeze
Like the blossoms in a meadow, the flowers cannot thrive without the dew and the wind. For a bilateral relationship to work, both sides must feel that they have a stake and a part to play, each party must feel nourished and enriched. It cannot be about what you want and what I want, we must both want it together.?
This is the meaning of bilateral. ?

Trump blames both sides for deadly violence in Virginia
	
?
REUTERS, 16th AUGUST, 2017- President Donald Trump insisted on Tuesday that left- and-right-wing extremists became violent during a weekend rally by white nationalists in Virginia, reigniting a political firestorm over U.S. race relations and his own leadership of a national crisis.
Trump, who drew sharp criticism from Republicans and Democrats for his initial response, reverted on Tuesday to his position that both sides were at fault for the violence, a day after bowing to pressure to explicitly condemn the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups.
Appearing angry and irritated, the president maintained that his original reaction was based on the facts he had at the time. Blame, he said, belonged on both sides.
?You had a group on one side that was bad, and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent. And nobody wants to say that, but I?ll say it right now,? Trump said, referring to right- and-left-wing protesters.
From there, the back and forthwith reporters turned tense.
?Not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch,? Trump said of the participants in the deadly protest. ?There was a group on this side. You can call them the left ... that came violently attacking the other group. So you can say what you want, but that?s the way it is.?
The violence erupted on Saturday after white nationalists converged in Charlottesville for a ?Unite the Right? rally in protest of plans to remove a statue of Robert E. Lee, commander of the pro-slavery Confederate army during the U.S. Civil War.

Van hits pedestrians in Barcelona ?terror attack?
	
A van has ploughed into crowds in Barcelona's famous Las Ramblas tourist area, the BBC reported a short while ago.
It said people were killed and injured as the vehicle sped along the pedestrianised area, sending many fleeing for cover in shops and cafes.
Witnesses had said the van had deliberately targeted people before coming to a stop.
Quoting the El Pais newspaper, the BBC said the driver of the vehicle had fled on foot after mowing down dozens of people.
Police are treating the incident as a terror attack.
Spanish media reports say one or two armed men barricaded themselves inside a bar in the area after the attack.
Tom Markwell from New Orleans, who was just arriving in a taxi in Las Ramblas, said: "I heard a crowd screaming. It sounded like they were screaming for a movie star.
"I saw the van. It had already been busted on the front. It was weaving left and right, trying to hit people as fast as possible. There were people lying on the ground."
Aamer Anwar said he was walking down Las Ramblas, which was "jam-packed" with tourists.
"All of a sudden, I just sort of heard a crashing noise and the whole street just started to run, screaming. I saw a woman right next to me screaming for her kids," he has told Sky News.
"Police were very, very quickly there, police officers with guns, batons, everywhere. Then the whole street started getting pushed back.
"Police officers who got there just started screaming at people to move back, move back."
Vehicles have been used to ram into crowds in a series of attacks across Europe since July last year.

## Title: Vijaya Nandasiri The comedian as a professional A tribute to an artiste who left us, but not our mem

Vijaya Nandasiri The comedian as a professional A tribute to an artiste who left us, but not our mem
	
Vijaya Nandasiri was greater than his successors in Sinhala comedy the same way that Joe Abeywickrema was greater than his predecessors. The latter was the apotheosis of Eddie Jayamanne. He was of course greater than Eddie could be, since Eddie?s roots were in the theatre, never really on film. Vijaya, on the other hand, was the grand culmination of everything that Joe stood for, with the caveat that the one was manifestly different to the other. He is the last comic we can claim as of today, since everyone else, as I pointed out in my last article, was and are at best mimetic. ?
Despite their differences, both began their careers as comic foils, whose function in the movies they were in was to console the protagonists. In the sixties Joe was almost always this foil, with Getawarayo (opposite Gamini Fonseka) and Dahasak Sithuvili (opposite Henry Jayasena). The seventies saw him emerge as his own player, good and redeemable except when he was the antihero or villain, in which case he was either doomed to suffer and die (Welikathara and Bambaru Avith) or to disappear from the story altogether (Suddilage Kathawa and Adara Hasuna). The only difference between them was this: while Joe belied a serious facade even in the most absurd dilemmas, Vijaya could at most only pretend to such a facade. ?
Vijaya?s inability to hide the absurdity of whatever situation he was in proved to be his strength just as his ability to so do proved to be Joe?s. Even in Kolamba Sanniya, the most enduring tribute to Sinhala comedy ever conceived on film (lavishly produced, it was a lavish hit at the box-office), you never distrust his ability to walk on a tightrope. As funny or inescapable some of the dilemmas he?s in are, he escapes them, trumping his own family?s expectations of him by contesting as a politician in his area. He?s a man of order, of method, even though he deceives us into thinking that he?s not. ?Yuri Gagarin, Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy; they are all my cousins!? he pompously remarks in Kolam Karayo. We disbelieve him, obviously, but not the sincerity and conviction with which he utters it. ?
The opposite was true for Vijaya Nandasiri?s characters. ?I?m an honest man!? he parrots out as Rajamanthri. We believe neither the remark nor the confidence and conviction. Because both the man and his ideals are never what they seem, he was almost always a trickster, a conman, a deceiver no matter how good his intentions were. His characters were all vain, conceited, and self-centred, interested in what was out there only as long as it served him. He was that kind of figure in Nonawarune Mahathwarune and Yes Boss. Loud but never too loud, brash but never too brash, his characters were almost always cowards when it came to grappling with reality. ?
He revelled in having no self-respect even when we ascribed to him some sense of honour and dignity. In Nonawarune Mahathwarune Premachandra flirts with the woman next door (Sanoja Bibile) though we never get why the latter returns his affections (is she tired of her husband, or is she truly infatuated with her idiotic neighbour?). As Senarath Dunusinghe in Yes Boss, the situation is reversed; he has to suffer another man playing around with his wife, the problem being that the man happens to be his employer who doesn?t know that they are married (because couples can?t work at the same office). You wonder why he doesn?t resign to seek shelter in another agency, but then there wouldn?t be a story in the first place, would there? ??
He revelled in having no self-respect even when we ascribed to him some sense of honour and dignity. In Nonawarune Mahathwarune Premachandra flirts with the woman next door (Sanoja Bibile) though we never get why the latter returns his affections (is she tired of her husband, or is she truly infatuated with her idiotic neighbour?)
Vijaya represented our contempt for womanisers, cuckolds, and politicians by turning them into stereotypes to be laughed at. In Nonawarune Mahathwarune he was the womaniser, in Yes Boss he was the cuckold (though his wife only pretends to give in to their boss?s advances), and as Rajamanthri, easily the most recognisable comic figure in our cinema from the past 20 or so years, he was the politician. It was as Rajamanthri that he prospered, even in those movies where he wasn?t him (as with Sikuru Hathe, King Hunther, and Magodi Godayi). Joe could never quite transform our contempt for his characters because they weren?t contemptible in the first place; they were either lovable or hateful. His calm exterior never betrayed itself, as I pointed out before, whereas for Vijaya it always would. ?
Some years ago I watched a miniseries on Rupavahini about a politician and his driver. Vijaya Nandasiri was the politician, Vasantha Kumarasiri the driver. And yet I sensed something odd about them. Their voices were different. The dubbing team had synced one actor?s with the other, a feat that survived the first 10 or 15 minutes of the first episode, after which these two meet a horrible accident which (inexplicably) leaves both onlookers and relatives confused as to which body is whose. ??
Because both are so near dying, a quick surgery is followed by a quick plastic surgery, in which the wrong face is placed on the wrong body. The voices are back to the correct actor. In hindsight this was an unnecessary gimmick, but it was also a welcome gimmick, since for the rest of the story the driver becomes the conservative believer in authority and the politician the radical believer in Marx. Crude, and rather one-dimensional, but fun. And it wasn?t just a change of voice: it was also a change of spirit, of two contradictory personalities transplanted to each other. That was Vijaya?s charm. You could never anticipate anyone other than him, when he was there. ?
If Joe was redeemable because he was at the receiving end of some confusing dilemma (like the baby he has raised in Punchi Baba, or the lifestyle of Colombo he has to get used to in Kolamba Sanniya), Vijaya was unredeemable because he was at the other end, always provoking if not unleashing some havoc. It?s probably not a coincidence that in this respect, his characters were always middle class, consumerist, often in professions that called for security, stability, sometimes status: as a Junior Visualiser in an advertising agency in Yes Boss, the chief in a security firm in Sir Last Chance, and a sergeant in Magodi Godayi. Where he was his own man ? the magul kapuwa in Sikuru Hathe or the bumptious Rajamanthri in so many movies and TV series ? he wasn?t a provocateur, but a lovable antihero. And like all antiheroes, he conceals goodness because he himself despises it, like in Sikuru Hathe, where all those deceptions he commits were for his family, especially his daughter. ?
Where he was paired with another actor, he failed. He was his man, so when in Methuma he and Sriyantha Mendis are caught as two lunatics by a veda mahaththaya in some village, he didn?t really shine the way he had in Ethuma. Even in Magodi Godayi, opposite Gamini Susiriwardana, he was less than he usually was. Yes Boss and Nonawarune Mahathwarune had him among a plethora of other actors, to be sure, but then he was on his own there. He could have been in his own world. ?
So once he was cast with another actor, he couldn?t give his best. He could give his best only if his co-star was alert and alive to his range, or if his character was of a lesser breed than that co-star. That is what transpired in King Hunther, where he could be himself opposite Mahendra Perera for two reasons; because Mahendra was a versatile comic actor himself, and because Hunther was from a different time, so different and long ago that this present world (in which Mahendra is an escaped convict) is outlandish, overwhelming. It needed time to get used to, and that meant getting used to the first two people he befriends: Mahendra and Anarkali Akarsha. ?
Vijaya Nandasiri?s triumph then was his gift at getting us to feel for unfeeling antiheroes. Sometimes he could trump us, as Joe often did, like in King Hunther, when he hears that the politician who befriends him to further his own interests has decided to kill him off, and surreptitiously escapes. You never thought he was capable of such a feat, but that?s how the movie ends. In vindicating his faith in us, he was getting us to vindicate our faith in him, no matter how idiotic he was. ?
He couldn?t be like that as Rajamanthri because he was not reflecting our contempt for figures of authority, but downright embodying it. When, towards the end of Suhada Koka, he is killed off by an assassin acting on the orders of the second-in-command to the Prime Minister (W. Jayasiri), there?s a homily on the corrupting influence of power that?s supposed to represent every politician?s ultimate fate. And then, just as you come to terms with this end, he wakes up (because it was a nightmare). ?
You?d think he?d learn from his fears, but he doesn?t. Even after that harrowing fantasy, he?s back to being the pompous figure he always was and will be. But in that short sequence he told us everything that needed to be told about the way in which the corrupt could be taught the errors of their ways. Was it a cruel coincidence that the only time Rajamanthri was killed off like that marked the last time Vijaya played Rajamanthri? We don?t really know, but perhaps it was more than a coincidence. Perhaps it was the only fitting end to such a career that could be filmed. ?

Wijeyadasa to make a special statement on Monday
	
Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, who was at the centre of controversy after being accused of violating the collective responsibility of the Cabinet by some of his colleagues, is to make a special statement on Monday, UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim told journalists today.
Minister Hashim told journalists that Mr. Rajapakshe assured the party's working committee and the parliamentary group that he?will make a statement on Monday on the true situation regarding the statements he made earlier.
He said Mr. Rajapakshe is also expected to meet Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe shortly before making the public statement. Further, Mr. Hashim said the government will also take some important steps especially with regard to collective responsibility of the ministers.
"The decisions which the government will take on Monday will be relevant to all members of Cabinet and not just one member" he said. Government Parliamentary group is to meet on Monday.
Earlier, there were heated arguments at the working committee where some members had criticized Mr. Rajapakshe for the statements he made on Corruption probes and on the Hambantota Port.
However, the Minister has denied the statement he had made on Hambantota. 'I never said I won't look back till I cancel the Hambantota agreement" he had told the working committee.
Meanwhile, Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha De Silva in a twitter message said Minister Rajapakshe denied of doing anything wrong even after the entire UNP working and parliamentary groups fiercely criticized him for two hours.
The journalists were able to witness Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera coming out of the working committee meeting in an agitated manner.
However, Deputy Minister Perera who spoke to the journalists later said he was happy about the outcome at the working committee meeting.
?Our opinion is that action against corruption should be expedited and if anyone says it cannot be done quickly that is wrong as this government was voted in to punish the corrupt,? he said.
The working committee has not made any decision on Minister Rajapakshe at today?s meeting though it was anticipated that some decision would be made against him. (By Yohan Perera)
