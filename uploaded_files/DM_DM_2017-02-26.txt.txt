CB violated the law earlier when issuing T. Bonds: Fin.Ministry
	
Gazette Notification No. 1895/19 dated 1 January 2015 issued by the then president, Mahinda Rajapaksa is a unique example of relevance of fraudulent management of public debt by him, the then CB Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal and officials in the Central Bank (CB) in violation of laws, the Finance Ministry announced today.
Issuing a press release, the Ministry made several interim clarifications for the gazette revealed during evidence given by the secretary to Ministry of Finance on 23 February 2017 to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) on the Treasury bond issuances
The gazette contains authorization given under section 4 of the Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance to raise loans during the year 2015 through issuance of 31 Treasury bonds of different redemption periods at different interest rates at auctions as notified by the Registrar of Public Debt through newspapers, it said.
The ministry said that the bonds stipulated in the gazette included many bonds issued in the past at various interest rates since 2011, and that it appeared that the Gazette authorized the past bonds as well.
According to the gazette, loans will be raised through those bonds within the sum of Rupees one thousand seven hundred and eighty billion authorized in the Appropriation Act, No. 41 of 2014, the ministry said.
However the practice followed in the past by the CB was to issue the gazette back-dated to January 1 each year, after issuing all bonds during the year in a hidden attempt to comply with the requirement of Section 4 of the Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance, while mismanaging bond issuances, it said.
The ministry also informed that the required protocol had not been followed while issuing the particular gazette as instead of sending the draft to the secretary of the line ministry to obtain legal and technical clearance, the Superintendent of the Public Debt (PD) Department had directly sent it to the Government Printer after getting legal clearance from the CB lawyers.
Meanwhile, the ministry noted that all Treasury bonds had been issued in violation of the provisions of the Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance and the CB officials mismanaged public debt to facilitate the Mahinda Rajapaksa Government and Ajith Nivaard Cabraal, through the questionable private placements of bonds.
However, in the gazettes issued in the past, all private placements were legalized as issuance at auctions announced by the Registar of Public Debt.
The ministry said that appropriate legal action would be taken against the officials involved under the provisions of the Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Champika: SAITM issue could lead to violence
	
The SAITM (South Asia Institute of Technology and Medicine) controversy was fast heading towards a violent situation that might claim lives of the youth in the country, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka has warned.
Reminding the loss of lives during the efforts by the then Government to introduce private Universities in 1980s, the Minister in a Cabinet Paper had warned the Government not to aggravate the situation.
He said in the Cabinet Paper that universities in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, France and Germany were run as none-profit institutions and university education in those countries except for the US was purely under the Government's purview.
He also observed that the quality of the higher education in India has declined due the privatisation of University education and the prestige that had been gained internationally by the Indian doctors was also fast eroding as a result.
Challenging the notion that majority of qualified students do not get the opportunity for university education, the Minister argued that those get three S passes at the AL examination were considered as qualified for university education but it was not in fact a good standard.
He also pointed out that many talented students in the urban areas were deprived of university education due to the district quota system that had been envisaged to help under-privileged students in the backward districts.
The Government has to increase the student intake in order to resolve the problem faced by the talented students owing to the district quota system, he said.
Hailing the standard of the State Universities in Sri Lanka Mr. Ranawaka observed that Colombo University had ranked 2,092nd under the Webometrics Ranking of World Universities, while the SAITM ranking 16, 964th place.(Dayaseeli Liyanage)

Govt. conspires to land Bond scam to MRs A/c.: JO
	
A conspiracy to transfer the Treasury Bonds scam to former President Mahinda Rajapaksas account has been enacted by the present government, Joint Opposition (JO) today revealed.
The largest financial fraud that believed to have taken place in the Sri Lankas history so far. JO parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardene said the Presidential Committee of Inquiry (PCoI) is attempting to prove that the Bonds were issued following a gazette notification released by ex-President Rajapaksa.
Addressing a press briefing, he said that the fundamental process of issuing the Treasury Bonds was started on February 20, following a letter sent by the operations department attached to Treasuries to the Central Banks (CB) Public Debt Department requesting the money to cover the cash flow for the month of March 2015.
Treasuries has analysed that 13.55 billion was needed, as per the cash flow they prepared. On February 23, CBs Monetary Board decided to issue a 30-year-bond to fulfil the forthcoming months financial requirement, he said
MP Gunawardena said that according the calculation, the Bonds issued in 2015 are maturing on 2045, and the authorization was given by the Finance Ministry to sell the Bond for a period of 30 years.
On 25, the Central Bank announced that they only needed 1billion for the Government financial requirement and they were issuing a 30-year-Treasury Bond to lend money and published the auction date as 27, he said.
He said on February 26, 2015 Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake and Cabinet Minister Kabir Hashim, Secretary of the Finance Ministry Prof. Samaratunga and the Secretary of the Higher Education and Highways Ministry have visited the CB Governor and told him that there was a liability of 44 billion to the contractors of highways and 15 billion needed as an immediate requirement.
He further said that not the former president who requests to sell these Bonds or authorised to lend money through these Bonds. He said that the scam came to light following the CBs internal data breach where the CB governor was responsible as he told Perpetual Treasuries about the sudden increase in the Bonds' value.
Former Minister Gunawardena stressed that this scam was a result of the confidential internal data breach and was not the then President Rajapaksas fault. He said that the PCoI currently interrogating on some edited part of the history of this Bond issue.
Finance Ministry cannot lend money in accordance with old gazettes. The government was conspiring to place the blame on Former President by saying he has signed the gazette whereas only a letter was sent to CB requesting the funds, and the gazettes were not even involved, he said.
