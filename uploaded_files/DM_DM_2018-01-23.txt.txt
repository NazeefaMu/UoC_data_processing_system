PRECIFAC recommends legal action on MR and Gota
	
Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) which had held former President Mahind Rajapaksa responsible for allegedly causing a financial loss to ITN had recommended filing of legal action against him.
The Commission had concluded that former President and three former officials of ITN had been guilty of causing the state TV channel a loss of Rs 102,158,058 by getting it to telecast his advertisements free of charge during the presidential election. It has held that the defendants have committed a crime under section 70 of the Bribery Act. The Commission had also recommended that ITN should be converted into an independent institution.
PRECIFAC has also stated that Former Defense Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Nissanka Senadipathi, Major General Palitha Fernando, and former Navy Commanders Sisirakumara Kolambage and Maximus Jayaratne had committed an offence as per section 70 of the Bribery Act. The Commission had recommended that focus should be made on taking legal action against the said persons. In addition, former MP Duminda Silva has been held responsible for using Rakna Lanka employees for political activities. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardena)

President tells PM: Give me strength to punish rogues
	
President Maithripala Sirisena on Monday made an appeal to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe asking him to give him the strength without weakening him so that he could punish the fraudsters concerned.
He reminded that there was a saying that it was better to proceed with the lions after bending the head rather than go ahead with a pack of dogs.
Addressing a United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) election meeting in the city of Kandy, the President said:  The supporters of G.L.Peiris party are highlighting about the appointment of the Bond commission on election platforms. They should know that this scam had taken place not only in 2015/2016 but also from the year 2008. The Supreme Court judges have mentioned it in the Commission report. Therefore, we are carrying out a practical inquiry. I am ready to face any threat when I am going to act against corruption. I got out of the then government against the family rule and frauds that existed at that time. The people know what happened after that.
He added that the thieves and fraudsters should be punished at any cost and that he was making a request from Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe to imprison them. In order to do so, he requested that the necessary strength be given to him. (Nalaka Sanjeewa Dahanayaka)

Continuing to lend its support to government retirees, Sampath Bank scaled up the benefits being offered to them under the Sampath Samachara Government Pensioners Loan scheme.
The bank has raised the upper limit on this unique loan designed specifically for government retirees to Rs.2 million.
The maximum repayment period too has been extended up to 10 years. Sampath Bank is also rewarding them with gifts with each loan above Rs. 100,000 in appreciation of the services they have rendered to the nation.
Having worked hard all through their lives, pensioners may find themselves to be short of funds when it comes to fulfilling their needs and dreams or those of their loved ones. Be it a childs higher education, a wedding; or an overseas pilgrimage, they could always use some additional money. The enhanced loan limits, extended repayment period and hassle free processing, make Sampath Samachara the ideal choice in such situations.
Monthly pension payments are the primary source of income for a vast majority of retired government servants. Having dedicated most of their lives to serving the public, they may find themselves being unable to fulfil their dreams in their golden years. Saluting retirees for the services rendered to the nation, we at Sampath Bank, seek to provide them with the funds needed to meet such additional expenses through the Sampath Samachara Government Pensioners Loan scheme, said Tharaka Ranwala, Senior Deputy General Manager - Consumer Banking, Sampath Bank PLC. We are now offering loans of up to Rs.2 million at the lowest interest rate in the market for such advances and have extended the repayment period up to 10 years too. This together with our exemplary service levels make it the perfect choice for retired government servants.
The applicants need to get a simple insurance cover for the loan amount and remit their pension to any Sampath Savings or Current account or a Sampath Sanhinda Saver account. Offering a higher rate of interest on savings to those over the age of 55, the Sanhinda Saver account makes interest payments twice a month and provides retirees with a world of other unparalleled benefits and privileges.
Applicants can obtain a Sampath Samachara loan, which is open to all retired government servants under the age of 70 with a monthly pension of Rs. 15,000 or more, without any security, collateral or guarantors.
At Sampath Bank, we strive to uphold uniquely Sri Lankan values and belief systems while offering innovative financial solutions. The Sampath Samachara Government Pensioners Loan scheme draws inspiration from our tradition of caring for elders and is an expression of our gratitude to retired public servants who have done great service to the nation, said Thusitha Nakandala, Deputy General Manager  Branch Banking, Sampath Bank PLC.
We have now overhauled the loan with higher limits and extended settlement periods to offer greater value to them. We are delighted to offer them gifts with every loan above Rs. 100,000 as a token of our appreciation. They can also avail a host of other benefits and privileges aligned to their lifestyle by opening a Sampath Sanhinda Saver account linked to the loan. Together, the Sampath Sanhinda Saver account and the enhanced Sampath Samachara Government Pensioners Loan scheme will help brighten their lives.
Thus, with higher maximum loan limits and repayment periods together with the lowest interest rate for such loans in the market, the revamped Samachara Government Pensioners Loan scheme presents itself as the ideal cash advance proposition to help retirees meet additional expenses. This becomes all the more valuable during the holiday season when they would be looking to indulge themselves and their loved ones. Sampath Bank has made it even more appealing by offering valuable gifts including foldable chairs and food containers with every Samachara loan over Rs. 100,000, during this period.

Theres a lady-love of a prominent purohita bent on running the entire Ministry like her household. This fashion-conscious dainty one -- from the healthcare service -- who breezes in and out like a Ministry high-up goes round issuing instructions to the staff giving the impression that she is the boss when the purohita is away.

The dainty one raised many an eye brow when she recently attended an important seminar dressed in short skirts, they say.
The meddlesome cutie has incurred the contempt of most Ministry employees who now refer to her by the sobriquet, Sakkara-vattama.

The President has been misled: Bandula
	
The Joint Opposition (JO) today rejected remarks made by President Maithripala Sirisena that former president Mahinda Rajapaksa had abstained from voting for a no-faith motion against MP Ravi Karunanayake and said the President had been mislead.
He told a news briefing that two no-faith motions were handed over to the Speaker against the MP but they were not taken up for a debate, let alone a vote.
The first no-confidence motion was submitted when Mr. Karunayake was finance minister over irregularities in budget expenditure. This motion was included in the parliamentary agenda but it was never taken up for debate. The second motion was submitted when Mr. Karunanayake was the foreign minister, over the Central Bank bond scam. This motion was not even included in the parliamentary agenda. When the situation is like this, how can Mr. Rajapaksa congratulate Ravi Karunanayke and say that he didnt vote for the no-faith motion, MP Gunawardana said.
He said Mr. Rajapaksa was someone who instructed the JO to draft and prepare the no-faith motions against Mr. Karunanayake and hand them over to Parliament immediately.
President Sirisena has been clearly mislead by someone who wanted to make him uncomfortable, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Unfailing patrons for this racketeer too
	
A fuel filling station in a city suburb was sealed recently on being found committing the offense of pumping kerosene oil to bowsers to be used for illegal purposes.

In fact, it is illegal for a filling station to pump in any fuel in bulk to bowsers etc. for they are expected to provide fuel only to vehicles.
This racket of selling kerosene in bulk for illegal purposes like mixing it with petrol had been going on for some time and the Police caught the fuel station employees red-handed.
Now a senior purohita from the Western province and a deputy one from a remote area in the country have begun pestering the authorities concerned with repeat requests to restore the license to the errant filling station owner.

UNP willing to continue with Unity Govt.
	
We dont tolerate corruption and frauds 
	We wont hesitate to take action against party members if found guilty 
	Unlike other Govts. we first probed allegations against us 
	Will expedite investigations into frauds during former rule 
	Will take final decision on Unity Govt. after elections 
	PMs name never tainted with corruption allegation

Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, in an interview with the Dailymirror , said that the United National Party (UNP) doesnt stand for corruption. He said that the party will penalize those responsible for the Central Bank bond transaction. Following are excerpts of the interview done with minister Kariyawasam.

QHow is your partys election campaign progressing 
We started our campaign from Kandy. We intend to have a series of meetings and rallies which will be attended by Party Leader Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and other Cabinet Ministers. We hope we can register a handsome victory this time. The present Government will last for another two and a half years. People want to get their development work done through the party in power. Only the party in power can pump in money to the local authorities for the development of access roads, bridges, culverts etc. Normally, the Local Government Elections are a clean sweep for the ruling party. It has happened right throughout history. People know it. 
On the other hand, we have planned to obtain foreign expertise for matters such as garbage management. Though the UNP is party to the Government, it did not have control over the local authorities and the Provincial Councils. As such, development took place at snails pace. Once we secure power at these two tiers of governance, we can accelerate our development drive. 
QMembers are elected for a period of four years at this election. A National Election is due next year. Then, how can you say the Local Government bodies will remain totally under the present Government 
We will have to go for a National Election after two years. There is no doubt that we will win that election. We can do a whole lot of work during these two years. We are confident that we can win most of the local bodies. At the last parliamentary elections, the UNP got the single largest majority. That was when the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) contested undivided. Today, it is split. So, this election is clearly advantageous to us. It is simple arithmetic. 
QSome UNP MPs articulate every time that a UNP Government will be formed after this election breaking ranks with Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). You are a key Minister. What is your view 
We can consider after the elections whether to proceed with the national Unity Government or not. We only want to deliver a lot to the country in terms of development. We want people to benefit. We can choose the best path for it after this election. If it is possible, we will try to forge ahead with the national unity government. We have to do it after contacting President Maithripala Sirisena.
QHow feasible is it for the two parties to stay together in the context of President Sirisena being so harsh on the UNP 
There is no serious issue. Its acceptable in the event of a National Government. As long as the two leaders maintain a mutual understanding, it is not a serious issue. This is a novel experience. The two parties, that were hostile to each other right throughout, have got together for governance for the first time. We have to iron out issues and move ahead.
QThe UNP MPs insist on their own Government. They say party men could not be looked after well because of the Unity Government. Do you have the same view

It is reasonable for some UNP MPs to feel so. There are some members who were opposed to us, but joined the Government later. When such members make harsh criticism against us, our MPs feel let down under their own Government. We try to achieve what is best for the country. When considering the mannerism of their criticism, even people of this country feel the same. There is a clear contradiction between what they say now and what they did at that time. We only took the lead in electing President Sirisena to office. We want to sort out issues if there are any. 
QAre you trying to say that the Unity Government should remain till 2020 
Actually, wed like to move ahead with the Unity Government with there being a mutual understanding between the President and the Prime Minister. However, we will have a meeting as a party after the elections and take a decision.
QThere are serious allegations regarding the frauds in the controversial bond transaction. How has it affected your party 
There is no problem. The Commission has not made any allegation against the Prime Minister. He is not been made an accused in the case. As a governing party, we took appropriate action after the bond scam was reported. We appointed a committee. The matter was referred to the COPE. The Presidential Commission was appointed. That was done after deliberation between the President and the Prime Minister. For the first time, the Prime Minister went before the Commission and testified. 
The Commission found that Perpetual Treasuries Ltd, as a primary dealer involved in bond trading, made undue profit of Rs.11 billion. As the Subject Minister, the Prime Minister had taken steps to freeze the companys financial assets. There is no loss to the state because this money can be recovered from them.
A cabal of fraudsters is now trying to cling to the bond scam as a means to resurrect themselves from their political mess. We will not leave room for them to raise their heads again. In fact, we can recover the monies lost due to the bond scam from the frozen assets of PTL. The very same Commission stated that major frauds causing an enormous loss to the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) had taken place during the former rule. We can recover the Rs.11 billion loss from the assets of PTL. We have to investigate the fraud of Rs.4000 billion. People know everything. 

We are confident that we can win most of the local bodies. At the last parliamentary elections, the UNP got the single largest majority.
QActually, there are allegations against the former Government. Despite being in power for the past three years, the Government has been unable to establish itself with the much needed evidence to prove these allegations. But, the allegations against the present Government are now proven. What is your response 
As a responsible Government, we probed the allegation made against us. Normally, in the past, the successive Governments swept under carpet the allegations made against them. We are an exception in that sense. We probed the allegations against us. However, we will speed up investigations into the cases against fraudsters of the past Government. Some cases have got stuck at the Attorney Generals Department. We have to speed up action. We can hear court cases on an ad hoc basis. It takes time. Once we work out a mechanism to expedite the hearing of these cases, we can see what will happen to those who cry hoarse today. 
QYou have a different mandate. You were elected to office with the promise to root out corruption and fraud. What did you feel when you heard about the bond scam under the very same Government that vowed to eliminate corruption 
We still hold that position. We cannot take total responsibility for what officials were involved in. For example, I fully trust that the Commissioner General of Examinations discharges his duties well. If there is a complaint, I seek a report from him. It is fully trusted by me. I cannot go and examine the allegations on my own. We are opposed to corruption and fraud. We assigned the COPE Chairmanship to JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti. The Prime Ministers political career, spanning over 40 years, is not tainted with corruption allegations. There is no need for him to indulge in corruption in his 41st year in politics. 
These are baseless allegations made by some individuals whose names have been tainted with corruption and frauds during the previous rule.
QHowever, the UNP MPs tried to cover up the bond scam right from the beginning. One MP even published a book to say that no scam has taken place. What is your view 
If anyone has done anything wrong, we will not protect him. The party is going to appoint a committee to probe this matter. If anyone is found guilty, the party will take action. We will not forgive anyone. Had we wanted, we could have formed our own Government. We did not opt for it, though.

US shutdown ends as Congress passes bill
	
The US government partial shutdown has come to an end after Republicans and Democrats voted for a temporary funding bill, the BBC reported today.
Accordingly, the Democratic leadership has agreed to back the bill after accepting promises from Republicans for a debate later on the future of young illegal immigrants.
President Donald Trump, who signed the bill on Monday evening, took a swipe at Democrats.
It is the fourth temporary measure since October because Capitol Hill cannot agree a longer-term budget.
The spending bill passed the Senate by 81-18 and the House of Representatives by 266-150 earlier on Monday.
The continuing resolution keeps the government funded until February 8 in the hope that Congress can reach a longer-term budget agreement in the meantime.
Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell said his party had "come to an arrangement" to negotiate on the Democrats' calls for an immigration deal.
Democrats want protections from deportation for so-called Dreamers, more than 700,000 young immigrants brought to the US as children.
But Republicans had insisted no agreement was possible while federal government services were closed.
President Trump, a Republican, said in a statement: "I am pleased that Democrats in Congress have come to their senses.
"We will make a long-term deal on immigration if, and only if, it is good for our country."

We began reviving a dead economy and will finish up stabilizing it: PM
	
The present regime in its present form was able start up the economy which was on a standstill and will end up stabilizing it by showing budget surpluses by 2020, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
The Prime Minister made this speech at an election rally in Gonawala organized by UNPs Biyagama Organizer Ruwan Wijewardene last evening.
We did not take over a stable government but an economy which was on a standstill just like a power station with broken generators. Generator of the power station which is called the economy is development. This power station was on a standstill when we took over the government as the country was in a debt trap and as there were no investors. However we have managed to fuel this power plant with investments and by settling the debts. We will complete what we started and will end up showing a budget surplus by 2020, the Prime Minister said.
He said the previous government borrowed funds and constructed a port without ships and an airport without planes. This is like mixing water with kerosene. However when we took over we managed to show an excess in primary accounts by making difficult decisions such as increasing VAT, he said.
Mr Wickremesinghe added that countries such as China, India and Japan had come to assist Sri Lanka after the government signed an agreement with IMF. All these countries will not help Sri Lanka if the agreement with IMF is abolished. He said the exports have increased by US $ 15 billion and the governments target is to increase it up to $ 20 to 30 billion.
The Prime Minister then went on to focus on the development plans of the government and said a net work of highways will be established from Kandy to Hambantota. He said industrial zones will be set up around this network.
Venerable Dambara Amila Thera who was seen at the UNP stage for the first time said people should not get angry with President Maithripala Sirisena for what he says as he cannot shuffle the ministries without consulting the Prime Minister under the 19th Amendment to the constitution.
Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said all those who have been charged with corruption including those in the previous government will be in jail by 2020. (Yohan Perera)

	Many women, especially old women, are deprived of financial reimbursements
	Banning women from buying alcohol and being employed in bars is a prudent and an impressive decision by the President.

	All the party members respect our female candidates and give us the due status

Actress Ruwanthi Mangala who has thrown her hat into the ring with regard to the forthcoming Local Government Elections, spoke about her political ambitions and other important matters in an interview with the Daily Mirror. Mangala is contesting for the Kaduwela Electorate under the Sri Lanka Podujana Party (SLPP) ticket. 
QWhat are your comments on increasing the quota for female candidates at the elections 
Its a really good move. More opportunities should be given to women in Sri Lanka. We cant depend on men every single day. As our population remains the highest in the country, equal windows should be opened for us to showcase our talents and make a living. More rural women will contest the local elections this time. I believe that the participation of women in Sri Lankan politics should be increased so that we will be able to stand for our rights, especially for those women who are less-privileged. 
QWhat is your opinion on the contribution by women to the economy of the country 
We all know that women have always faced institutional, political, and socio-cultural gender barriers. Women represent 52 percent of Sri Lankas population, but their representation is only about 5 percent in parliament. However, women at present arent willing to remain at home and do household work just like the women who lived during our grand parents days. They need to come out and break the stereotypes. I know of many women in my electorate who are engaged in some type of self-employment. They are no longer fond of expecting every little thing they need in their lives to be provided by their husbands. 
QIf you get elected, what plans do you have 
I will do my best to solve problems pertaining to women in Sri Lanka. Once I obtain political power, I will look into their problems and do what is required. Women in my area will be provided with self-employment opportunities, financial support and other encouragement so that they can start their own livelihoods. I hope to provide them with a sound training in whatever field they hope to work in. Many women, especially old women, are deprived of financial reimbursements. I want to make sure that they get what they deserve. 
QWhat is your view on the Presidents decision to reimpose the ban which prevents women from buying alcohol and finding employment in bars 
Banning women from buying alcohol and being employed in bars is a prudent and an impressive decision by the President. Already many Sri Lankan families are suffering due to men being addicted to alcohol. If the mother of the house starts drinking, poor children will have no favour at all. Many problems will arise if women are allowed this liberty. When women work in bars, they tend to be victims of sexual harassment. As males from all walks of life frequent bars, women will be pushed to choose wrong paths. I know there are many so-called womens organizations that are fighting against the ban. But, we have to understand that there are dos for women and at the same time there are also limits and dont s. 
QThe party you are contesting from was in trouble recently when actress Madusha Ramasinghe alleged that a party official demanded a sexual bribe from her in order to ensure she be given nomination. Not a single woman was there to voice against the incident.
Since I joined the party, I have never faced that kind of experience. All the party members respect our female candidates and give us the due status. I heard that the woman you are talking about got rejected from every party in their attempts to receive nominations. I really dont know about her mental situation at that time. However, we feel secure and respected within our party. 
QWhat do you think about the media reporting on artistes in Sri Lanka
It is very pathetic. Let me tell you about the recent mudslinging campaign carried out in social media against my husband Namal Udugama and me. People in Sri Lanka started bashing us without knowing the real story. They were misled by a particular politician who shamelessly used the incident to gain attention. How can some outsider talk about an incident which happened six years ago The person who donated his kidney to my husband is too innocent and too desperate. As he was in a dire need for money, the particular politician used money and manipulated the donor in order to get his personal agenda fulfilled. Our whole family went through a very hard time. This kind of campaigns should be stopped. We were not the first victims and wont be the last. People using social media are destroying artistes personal lives without mercy. All these gossip sites should be removed. If our Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna wins, I will push the heads of the party to take necessary legal actions against such bogus websites and pages. Administrators of those sites are just working for money, forgetting human virtues.

White washing the inseparable twin
	
An attempt being made by a leading politico of a main political party to whitewash a criminal very close to him is providing much amusement to his constituents, they say.
The criminal character is said to have worked hard for the victory of the politico at the last general polls.
Given the local polls round the corner, the politico is said to be going round his electorate telling people not to believe the stories afloat about the criminal acts alleged to have committed by his sidekick. But his efforts to put the man in a favourable light have only raised laughs among the people.

Wild Sri Lankan elephants retreat from sound of Asian honey bees
	
For the first time, researchers have shown that Asian elephants in Sri Lanka are scared of honey bees, much like their African counterparts.
Playbacks have been used for many years to explore the behavioural responses of African elephants to a suspected natural threat. However, the research published in Current Biology, is the first time this technique has been used to record how Asian elephants react to the sound of bees.
The study, led by Dr Lucy King, a Research Associate with the Department of Zoology at Oxford University and head of the Human-Elephant Co-Existence Program for Save the Elephants, showed that Asian elephants responded with alarm to the bee simulations. They also retreated significantly further away and vocalised more in response to the bee sounds compared to controls.
In collaboration with elephant scientists from Cornell University, Save the Elephants, Trunks and Leaves, Disneys Animal Kingdom and University of Peradeniya the team now hope that beehive deterrents, used so successfully to ward off African elephants from rural farm lands, can be applied to prevent Asian elephant populations from raiding crops.
Dr Lucy King said: 'Asia has even higher levels of human-elephant conflict than Africa does and Asian elephants are approximately 10 times more endangered than African elephants. If we could help apply the results from this research to develop effective community-based beehive fence deterrent systems for rural Asian farmers living with elephants, we could have a significant impact on the survival of the Asian elephant species.'
The study was performed in Udawalawe National Park, which has an exceptionally large elephant population. 'Udawalawe is a microcosm for the issues Asian elephants face, because it is practically encircled by agriculture and settlements. This study takes the first step in offering a new way of addressing the conflicts that arise as a result,' said Dr. Shermin de Silva, Director of the Udawalawe Elephant Research Project.
In partnership with the Sri Lankan Wildlife Conservation Society and Australias Newcastle University, a network of 10 trial beehive fence projects are presently being tested to see if they can reduce human-elephant conflict for rural farms in central Sri Lanka.
'We have a wonderful community of willing farmers there who are helping us understand if beehive fences could work to reduce conflict in this intensely high human-elephant conflict zone,' said Dr King. 'Although beehive fences may not completely stop elephant crop-raids the honey bees provide other benefits to the farms in the form of pollination services and a sustainable income from honey and wax products'.
The initiative is already harvesting honey from the beehives and four beekeeping workshops have been held to boost beekeeping knowledge and honey processing skills. Further Asian beehive fence collaborations are being formed with scientists in Thailand, India and Nepal.(University of Oxford)

Women have other rights to fight for than liquor Gayesha perera
	
I always wanted to be someone who represented the people
	So this time Im sure that it is an open platform for people to contest
	One of its flagship projects includes the Amma programme where we give away essential items to pregnant women.
	Peoples taxes need to be used for their own benefit
	People need a leader who will talk on behalf of them
	A woman should have the freedom to do what she thinks is good for her

The Local Government polls have opened new doors for newcomers to test the waters in politics. Gayesha Perera, former Miss Sri Lanka and actress, who once contested the Provincial Council Elections in 2014, is once again contesting as a candidate of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) from the Dehiwala-East Kawdana Ward this February. In an interview with the Daily Mirror, Gayesha shared how she is preparing for the elections; 
Q Why did you want to enter politics
 
My actual dream was to become a leader in this country. When I was crowned Miss Sri Lanka in 2006 I applied for four other international pageants out of which I won two. I always wanted to be someone who represented the people. Eventually I became an actress and I started getting closer to the people through arts. But now I want to do some service to the country. 
QYou contested the previous Provincial Council Election as well. What happened 
I didnt get any response during that election because all those people connected to Ministers including their children got elected. So this time Im sure that it is an open platform for people to contest and Im doing my best. I believe that the introduction of the 25% quota itself is a stepping stone for us women to move forward in politics. 
QAs a newcomer in the political arena, how will you reach out to the people 
People want to live in a just society. Im sure they are fed up of all the corruption that happens behind closed doors. They always like to see a new face in the scene and chances are likely that they will vote for newcomers. We have done many projects through the Gayesha Perera Foundation and have voiced out against various incidents including little Seyas murder. In addition to that we sent relief during the floods and as such we not only help people in our electorate, but those residing across the country. One of its flagship projects includes the Amma programme where we give away essential items to pregnant women. 

People want to live in a just society. Im sure they are fed up of all the corruption that happens behind closed doors. They always like to see a new face in the scene and chances are likely that they will vote for newcomers
QHow are you preparing for the elections with the new election laws being imposed 
We have door-to-door campaigns in addition to pocket meetings and indoor meetings which involve five or six people. Peoples taxes need to be used for their own benefit, but it happens the other way round. We start canvassing at 2.00 pm and go on till 7.00pm. People need a leader who will talk on behalf of them; not someone who will give promises, fill their own pockets and walk away. 
QWhat immediate projects have you planned in your electorate 
Some of the main concerns include the sewage system, roads and drains. There are a higher number of mosquito breeding sites due to the negligence of people and the authorities. So we will find practical solutions for these concerns. We also have the Fire Brigade grounds which could be revamped in to a fully equipped playground and used by the youth in the area. 
QWhat challenges do you face as a newcomer due to the presence of a mixed electoral system 
It would have been better if the previous system continued. In fact it supports popular people. But this system is for the benefit of the people. 
QDo you think that the Government took the correct decision in imposing a ban on the sale of liquor for women 
A woman should have the freedom to do what she thinks is good for her. But having said that, I dont think women need liquor anyway. There are other rights which they should fight for. 
QHow confident are you that you will be elected 
Im very confident that I will win. People like to see a new face in the scene. They want someone who will walk their talk. I have already toured once around the electorate. We will keep talking to the people and work for their benefit.

Worlds richest one percent banked 82 percent of wealth created in 2017
	

Davos, (Compiled from Deutshe Welle), 23 Jan 2018 -Oxfam on Monday detailed how the richest one percent grew its wealth by $762 billion (620 billion) in 2017, which it says was enough to end poverty seven times over. 
The report was published on Monday, a day ahead of the start of the World Economic Forum in Davos. The Reward Work, Not Wealth report revealed that 2017 saw the biggest increase in the number of billionaires in history, at 2,043, and challenged the narrative that billionaires are created through talent, hard work and innovation, something that is claimed benefits humanity as a whole. Instead, Oxfam said there is growing evidence that the richest often grow much of their wealth by way of inheritance, monopoly or crony connections to government. In its report, Oxfam called for an overhaul of what it described as a warped economy that allows eight billionaires to own as much wealth as half of the worlds population, or 3.6 billion people, combined. 
The billionaire boom is not a sign of a thriving economy but a symptom of a failing economic system, said Winnie Byanyima, Executive Director of Oxfam International. The people who make our clothes, assemble our phones and grow our food are being exploited to ensure a steady supply of cheap goods, and swell the profits of corporations and billionaire investors.  Oxfam reported that pay ratios mean the average pay of leading UK company chief executives is 129 times that of the average employee. It was the equivalent of 10,000 people working in Bangladeshi garment factories.

Adulterated fuel - Gamsabha Junction filling station sealed
	
The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CEYPETCO) yesterday sealed the fuel dispensing pumps and the underground petrol storage tank of the Gamsabha Junction filling station over complaints that it had sold kerosene-adulterated petrol, Petroleum Resources Development Ministry said.
The raid was carried out by the CPC Special Raids Division.
A sample was referred to the laboratory for testing and further action will be taken after the results, the CPC said.
CEYPETCO sealed the Nawala filling station last Wednesday after it was found to have pumped kerosene to bowsers for commercial purposes. Filling stations have only been permitted to pump fuel to vehicles and not to bowsers or any other vehicle for commercial purposes.
Petroleum Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said they had introduced an expeditious method of carrying out raids and requested the public to inform the Special Raids Division via the following numbers: 0728870624 and 0777748417 of any incidents of adulterating diesel with kerosene.

America must rebuild trust and confidence:Jordans King
	

Jordan, (Daily Mail), 22 January 2018 -King Abdullah of Jordan has he appealed to US Vice President Mike Pence to rebuild trust and confidence in the possibility of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
Jordans king made the request in the wake of the fallout from the Trump administrations decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israels capital. 
In response, Pence tried to reassure the monarch that the US was committed to a two-state solution, if both sides agree - the condition a marked contrast to the long-standing US belief that the approach is the only possible outcome of any peace deal. 
Trumps announcement on Jerusalem last month infuriated the Palestinians, who seek the Israeli-annexed eastern sector of the city as a future capital. 
They accused the US of siding with Israel and said Washington can no longer serve as a mediator. 
Jerusalem is the centerpiece of the long-running conflict, and Trumps policy shift set off protests and condemnation across Arab and Muslim countries.

Former COPE chairman D.E.W. Gunasekera said today MP Ravi Karunanayake should be prepared to go to jail and wear the jumper, for giving false evidence at the Bond Commission inquiry.
He said the former minister had never told a truth during the investigation.
When did Ravi Karunanayake ever tell a truth At first, he said there was no such incident and later he said there was no connection with him. When questioned at the PCoI, he replied that he did not know how he got a housing unit from an apartment complex. After the commission completed recording of evidence, he said the commission was struggling to finalise the report and that the report would not be published, Mr. Gunasekera said.
He then said the report was false.As far as we know, all these things Ravi said are lies. The Bond Commission has made clear allegations against him for giving false evidence. Now this issue is at the level of taking judicial action. Therefore, he cannot escape. He will have to go to jail. We remind him to be ready to go to jail wearing the jumper, Mr. Gunasekera said.

Dismay as Sri Lankas Marine resources are exploited   !
	
The tourists unknowingly trample on the corals by walking over them
	with the presence of the El-Nino phenomena in 1998, most of the coral lost colour
	Hikkaduwa Marine National Park, with an extent of 102 hectares, is the first ever National Marine Park in the island
	The glass bottom boats, which approach the corals at a very close range, could damage the corals
	The Tsunami waves that came from the ocean brought with them mud
	The Buhu Bawas, that live on coral, being devoured by Star Fish also falls into the category of natural disasters

The sky overhead is so blue that it has tinged the ocean below. The scorching sunlight is unbearable. Tourists are all over the place. They are enchanted by the sight of corals. The office of the wild life conservation department located nearby is on guard. Someone emerges from nowhere carrying some bulky items. He is a little away from the rough waves. Some tourists are seen around the person carrying the heavy burden, which contains nothing, but bread. Now we are about to witness a common scene. A myriad of fish of all colours, shapes and sizes throng around him sensing the food they are about to receive. The ornamental fish have got used to this daily ritual and the tourists are thrilled by the large variety of fish and lose no time in clicking their cameras or taking selfies. We encountered the man and our inquiries revealed that he was very knowledgeable about the area, the behaviour of tourists and the impact on our culture and lifestyles of the local residents.





Sri Lanka is a tropical island where there exists a Marine environment that promotes the healthy growth of coral. These coral can be seen largely in Ambalangoda, Tangalle, Batticaloa, Trincomalee, Point Pedro, Mannar and in Great Basses and Little Basses
Dr. Ravindra Kariyawasam



Knowing that we were not exactly tourists, he described his actions in feeding the fish with bread, going on to say that fish love it. He works in a so called hut where snorkeling equipment, to view the corals, and other equipment, to watch the movement of fish, are rented out. Tourists visiting Hikkaduwa from all over the world could purchase eye guards, face covers, life jackets and other safety equipment, and waterproof pouches to carry Mobile Phones during deep sea expeditions from this hut which is one of many doing this kind of business here. Voices calling Hello Sir, Hello Madam could be heard from everywhere. The trader throws bread to the fish in order to attract more tourists to his hut. He little realizes that the danger he is causing to these fish that live around the corals. The breadcrumbs do not damage the corals, but the tourists standing on these corals to view the bread loving fish, swim around the trader in large numbers, pose a threat. The tourists unknowingly trample on the corals by walking over them in trying to catch a glimpse of the moving fish. This causes severe damage to the beautiful corals. 

Strict regulations
Hikkaduwa Marine National Park, with an extent of 102 hectares, is the first ever National Marine Park in the island. It became a National Marine Park on 18th of May with the release of the Marine species known as Buhu Bawa or the creator of corals which was done under the care of the Department of Wildlife Conservation. Close to the beach and in the shallow sea one can see a large number of fringing reef. But human activities like sea bathing, and the movement of glass bottom boats, used to view the corals, continue the damage done to the coral reef. In 1988 it was named as a natural conservation with the view of developing it. All this happened under the supervision of the Wild Life Conservation Department. But however, with the presence of the El-Nino phenomena in 1998, most of the coral lost colour showing signs of decay and death. This was the worst calamity to affect the coral reef in Hikkaduwa. Then it was named as Hikkaduwa Maritime National Park and strict regulations were imposed. With the Tsunami in 2004 further damage was caused to these Coral. The Tsunami waves that came from the ocean brought with them mud, sand and earth which fell on the corals causing further harm to them. Serious damage was caused to the Buonavista coral reef in Roomassala, Galle. Attempts made by environmentalists to mitigate the damage and replant of coral proved futile. 


If it is a State policy to develop tourism as an industry, the authorities should be mindful of the increase in tourist arrivals. These tourists, who visit the Marine National Park, should be provided with instructions regarding the behaviour expected from them during their stay inside the park. During snorkeling, and when viewing the coral, the precautionary steps to be adhered to and what not to do should be made known to them. The glass bottom boats, which approach the corals at a very close range, could damage the corals by accidentally hitting them or scraping against them, during manoeuvring. The smoke released from the boats along with the burning of fuel is very harmful to coral as well as to the fish that live among these coral. The hurricane that blew across the Eastern Coast of Sri Lanka in 1978 and the El-Nino which was observed in 1998 were the natural disasters that led to the destruction of the coral. The Buhu Bawas, that live on coral, being devoured by Star Fish also falls into the category of natural disasters. These happenings cannot be controlled by humans, but critics query as what makes the authorities hesitate in taking meaningful steps that are humanly possible Most parts of Europe are experiencing winter and it is during this time of the year that a large number of tourists arrive in Sri Lanka. One of their favourite destinations is Hikkaduwa. The presence of tourists is prominent in Hikkaduwa on week days whereas the locals converge in on this coastal town mostly during weekends. With the influx of visitors to the site the number of boat rides too increases. On some days the boat rides go up 100 fold. The growth of coral is limited to about an inch a year. But the damage done to the coral through human activity cant be measured by inches. This damage is caused mainly due to ignorance. 


Tourists unaware
Our inquiries from some of the tourists about their opinion on the Hikkaduwa National Marine Park proved futile. This is because they seem to be unaware of what was going on. They were even unaware that they are on a visit to a national park. This is true as there is no one to direct them or guide them. There was no presence of a responsible person representing any State institution. The wild life conservation office located nearby functions in a lackluster manner. The office, which seems apparently vacant, does not extend a friendly gesture to the tourist or for that matter to local visitors. At the time of our visit the officer manning the counter was engaged intensely with a guide perusing the preview of a sporting event published in a periodical that day. This sight reveals what is happening to the tourism industry. 
We spotted rows of female tourists sun bathing along the sandy beach. The smile extended to us by one of them urged us to start a conversation with one of them. She was much agitated and said, I am from Germany. This is my first visit to Sri Lanka. It was only yesterday that we came to Hikkaduwa.We saw lots of Turtles. We did not know that this place was a national park. The visitors at the place cautioned us about walking on coral. We did not know about the forest conservation office. Whatever is said there should be more stringent regulations in order to protect coral. They should at least put up some billboards displaying instructions to tourists. They can also include such guidelines in the website of the wild life conservation department. 
The German tourist who spoke to us is Annisams. She said that her comments and suggestions should not be put aside. It is time the bureaucracy ends and the authorities take steps to meet the needs of tourists and protect natural resources, which Sri Lanka can boast of. Just having an office will not serve the purpose. Maintaining this office will turn out to be another White Elephant. 
Hikkaduwa was very popular among tourists many years ago. This was because of the presence of the wonders of nature in the shallow waters in the form of coral. These coral were present in different shapes and colours. With the availability of new technology tourists are more aware of the sights in Hikkaduwa compared to locals. Most of them prefer to bathe in the blue waters of Hikkaduwa. The welcome waves and the blue waters are the only features left to market. They are aware of the dwindling coral. Wild Life Conservation is not updated with regard to the areas where corals can be found.

is a graduate from the Colombo University and holds a Masters Degree in Geographic Science. His final year thesis had been on coral and accordingly he possesses a vast knowledge of coral reefs. However from the opinions expressed by those engaged in tourism and activities related to foreign tourists it is clear that Hikkaduwa National Marine Park is just limited to a name board. 
Leaving Hikkaduwa our next site of exploration is Roomassala in Galle. This site has added to the magnificent scenery of the coast of Galle and is a few kilometres away Hikkaduwa.


Buona-Vista Coral Reef
Our attention is drawn to the Buona-Vista Coral Reef in Roomassala. Its present situation is much worse than Hikkaduwa. At the time of our visit we observe some tourists carrying away large pieces of coral removed from the site. Like in Hikkaduwa the Buona Vista site is also freely accessible and anyone can engage in vandalism. If the dead coral are allowed to remain in the sea after some time they would again start growing. But due to the human activities that are now predominant in the area the regrowing of coral is doubtful. The boats, used for commercial purposes, converge in the area. Their anchors are thrown into the water and damage the coral. When the anchors are removed no care is taken to spare or safeguard the coral. 



Whatever is said there should be more stringent regulations in order to protect coral. They should at least put up some billboards displaying instructions to tourists. They can also include such guidelines in the website of the Wildlife Conservation Department

The Jungle Beach located at the foot of Roomassala Hill is now very popular. It was once hidden from the sight of humans. It had been a prominent sea front with a luscious growth of vegetation and a palm fringed beach. It is now open to the entire world thanks to modern technology. At present it attracts thousands of tourists. The crystal clear beach with its glistening sandy soil was the main attraction for everyone who loved to stroll along the beach on a sunny day. Now it has become an eyesore with heaps of garbage being dumped. Empty biscuit cartons and beer cans are strewn all over. No one has been concerned to clear this garbage. It is a pity that the hotel owners and vendors are turning a blind eye on what is happening. They have striven hard and risked their lives to demarcate their areas of operation on the beach to cater to the vast number of visitors, but paid scant regard to the garbage that is building up. 
Coral are known as a typical type of marine species which bears importance in terms of economy, social and environment. It is created by Aquatic Marine species. Over the years it has contributed to our foreign earnings by attracting foreign tourists. It has beautified the environment and there exists many avenues for its growth and development. These corals were broken on large scale and used for purposes of building construction. History associated with cement shows that the Dutch Fort in Galle had been constructed in the sixteenth century using coral. With the awakening of the need for environmental protection and awareness being spread regarding the value of preserving marine resources, identified as Bio Diversity, proactive action is needed to protect coral. The amount of land in Sri Lanka is 65,000 square kilometres and the sea area is more than 200,000 square kilometres. Much interest is not shown regarding Bio Diversity as much of the area is sea. There is also concern when environmentalists do not express much concern. This has led to the increase of misusing Marine zones. The damage caused to the Marine resources is amply visible in Hikkaduwa. According to the latest records coral are facing extinction, unless conservation activities are carried out to arrest this situation. The entire blame now rests with the Wildlife Conservation Department which has been unable to do damage control. What has happened to the Buona-Vista Coral in Galle can happen to the coral in Hikkaduwa. 
Dr. Ravindra Kariyawasam, an expert on coral, when posed this question of the wanton damage that is being caused to corals opines, Hikkaduwa which remained as a Fisheries Security Zone was named as a sanctuary due to the existence of coral and Marine life on a large scale. Extending over an area of 250 acres, it consists of coral of the types Branch, Break, Stancork, Plate Leather etc. In Hikkaduwa the coral Athu Mora is seen in large numbers. This type of coral grows at a fast rate.
Such coral grows approximately 23 metres a year. This is followed by Plate Coral which grows only about a centimetre during a year. As Sri Lanka is a tropical island there exists a Marine environment that promotes the healthy growth of coral. These coral can be seen largely in Ambalangoda, Tangalle, Batticaloa, Trincomalee, Point Pedro, Mannar and in Great Basses and Little Basses.

B. Mallika (55) a resident of No 91 Konakumbukwewa, Puliyankulama in Rambewa Division in Anuradhapura has been in a predicament for want of a permanent income to maintain a family of five children and to provide treatment for her 22-year-old daughter, a cancer patient, and her son, who has been bedridden with a fractured spine. 
She said her meagre income as a manual worker was not adequate to meet the household expenses; particularly to provide treatment to the two sick children. He daughter, Mahushika Dilrukshi ( 22) has been suffering from cancer that has resulted in one of her limbs being amputated. She is now affected by an abnormal mental condition. Mangalika said that she has to take her daughter, the second in the family, to the Anuradhapura Hospital several times a month to obtain treatment at the clinic. 
She said that her son, the third in the family, who had been employed as a helper in a building site in Anuradhapua, had become the breadwinner of the family. However, unfortunately he had met with an accident during which he had fractured his spine. The injury has totally disabled him. Mangalika said that the other children in Grade eight and ten respectively were still attending school. 
 I have to take the two children to Anuradhapura for treatment bearing a heavy cost. I have to spend about Rs.10,000 to transport them by a hired vehicle and in addition Rs.15,000 is needed for medicine. Meanwhile our wattle and daub house was razed to the ground by floods compelling us to live in my brothers small house. My brother is a manual worker in the area and he is not in a position to help us although he provides us shelter in his small house, She said. Mallika said that his family was struggling for existence against heavy odds and requested for help from the public to survive.

The public who are eager to help this family may deposit their contributions to the Bank of Ceylon Kahatagasdigiliya Branch A/c No. 7924314 in the name of K.T. Kumara, the disabled son. Further details about this family can be obtained by calling 0784743416.

Don't sign FTA with S'pore: Professionals tell Govt.
	
Ahead of the governments move to sign a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Singapore, a collective of professional movements said yesterday there were serious violations of the law, best practices and good governance in the negotiation process of the agreement.
Issuing a communique, they said they took steps to inform all the Cabinet Ministers including President Maithripala Sirisena urging them not to grant Cabinet approval to go ahead with the agreement.
The professional bodies that signed the agreement are Government Medical Officers Association, Inland Revenue Trade Unions Joint Committee, Customs Officers Union, Ceylon Bank Employees Union, Association of Information Technology Professionals, Engineering Union of Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau,  Government Ayurveda Medical Officers Association, Public Service United Nurses Union, Government Dental Surgeons Association, National University Teachers Association, Railway Professionals Trade Unions Alliance, CPC Engineers Union, Lanka Pragathi Teachers Association, Progressive Bank Employees Front and Executive Officers' Association of Sri Lanka Technical College
The statement said the Cabinet approval had been obtained during the cabinet meeting held on January 16, 2018. As per media reports, this is the same meeting that the President addressed the Cabinet vociferously against corruption. Unfortunately, the Singapore-Sri Lanka FTA which was a result of a corrupt process has obtained the Cabinet approval at the same meeting. We would like to mention that Professionals National Front brought these malpractices to the attention of the President in a letter dated on September 13, 2017 and made sure that the letter received his attention as well.
The statement said, Professionals and industrialists of Sri Lanka continuously requested to make a national trade policy for Sri Lanka before jump into FTA negotiations with our major importing countries. It is evident that government had accepted that it is a due requirement because Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade appointed a New Zealand nationalist, Dr. Ravi Ratnayake to draft a so-called New Trade Policy. That draft which clearly shows the lack of professionalism in the field has also been able to obtain the cabinet approval. It is a very bad practice to ask one person to write a national trade policy, especially when he is already in the FTA negotiation process with several countries. This New Zealander is representing Sri Lanka in negotiations of FTAs which is a complete conflict of interest.
The late Dr. Saman Kelegama was the chairman of a leading multinational company in Sri Lanka which imports several million rupees worth of goods annually from India, China and Singapore. Surprisingly, he was the chief negotiator for Sri Lanka for FTAs with very same countries at the same time, until his demise. This is an unbelievable conflict of interest caused with plenty of evidence. Though he has passed away, several rounds of current negotiations have taken place while he was leading the Sri Lankan negotiation team.
Mr. K.J. Weerasinghe, the successor of Kelegama, has been in the negotiation team while obtaining a salary as an adviser to apparel industry of Sri Lanka which is another serious conflict of interest.

Free drinks to win votes
	

A certain candidate in the local polls fray known to be a lackey of a leading politico in the country is said to be operating a kasippu distillery in the backyard of his election office.

The candidate is liberally serving kasippu to voters who call over to express their support and those actively engaged in campaigning for him, they say.
The local Police are well aware of this kasippu spot, but are turning a blind eye to it, people in the area say.

IGP canvassing for govt, says MR
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said that the IGP was indirectly involving in propaganda work requesting to vote for the Yahapalana Government.
Addressing an election meeting in Mahiyawa, Kandy, Mr. rajapaksa said the IGP was addressing Police Officers in Vavuniya asking whether the Yahapalana Government is good And two police officers who went there from Colombo said Yes Sir by approving IGPs speech.
He further said, the Police were killing people in Kataragama and they were not doing it in Jaffna and if they had done so, they would have vanished.
Those who go to Jaffna are kept silent. But all are not so. There are good officers. An IGP who cant be controlled even by the President is trying to bring victory for the Yahapalana Government. The officers who went to Vavuniya from Colombo have not approved the speech of the IGP. The Police Officers in Vavuniya have not approved his speech. Nobody has talked about it.
The IGP who expressed his views implicitly to vote for Yahapalana Government, stresses the fact that the vote should be cast to the Yahapalana Government. The IGP has no right to do so. This is against the election law. We are making arrangements to complain regarding this. The IGP has no right at all to canvass votes on behalf of the politician, he said. (Nadeeka Daya Bandara)

Kataragama shooting -- Sagala pulls up Police Chief
	
Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayaka is reported to have taken Police Chief Pujith Jayasundara to task in connection with the incident where a youth was allegedly shot dead by a police constable in Kataragama.
At a meeting on Monday the minister is said to have spoken harshly to the Police Chief about Police negligence in the presence of Ministry Secretary Padmasiri Jayamanna.
The minister had directed the IGP to investigate this matter himself and to give him a full report about what had taken place.
He is reported to have told the IGP that the people's protectors must not turn to be predators, because such incidents could breach the peoples trust in the police.
Meanwhile, in a tweet the minister said the Kataragama incident where a youth had lost his life was not an isolated case.
The Kataragama incident is not an isolated one. This stems from the lack of training and professionalism. Failure to address core issues diligently, will throw us into similar situations time and again. So, drastic reforms will soon be introduced to the Police with the help of foreign experts, it said.
In a different tweet he said the Police themselves are subjected to the law.
Police themselves are subjected to law. When quelling a tense situation or an unruly demonstration, justifiable force should be used, in strict adherence to operating guidelines. It appears to be that these fundamentals have not been followed in relation to the Kataragama incident, he added.
The ministry had also decided to closely monitor police behaviour to prevent such tragic accidents in future. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Local administration experiences bitterest period under current rule: Basil
	
That itself is enough to unseat this government this time 
	There is no competitionfrom UNP
	President did unconstitutional things right after election to office
	It is not President who exposed bond scam
	Once evidence was found, police investigation should have commenced
	Bond scam is a daylight robbery
	MRs image used by three political camps

In an interview with Dailymirror , former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa who spearheads Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) spoke about the current status of politics and the local government elections. Excerpts:

QHow do you see the progress of campaigning
In general, voters are likely to be divided as pro-government and anti-government. There are people opposed to the government in its entirety. There are some who only oppose certain actions of the government. Next voters will be divided according to their affiliations with political parties such as the UNP- SLFP, SLPP and so forth.
According to opinion polls, only 30 per cent of people stand for the government. What is the government That is the UNP-SLFP combination. Apart from that, we have the JVP and TNA that cooperated with the government at times while being in the opposition.
The joint opposition was the only force oppositional to the government in the real sense. Now, the JVP is also trying to join the anti-government bandwagon. Even President Maithripala Sirisena and his SLFP try to be seen as an anti-government force. All are attempting to ride on the anti-government wave of public opinion prevailing at the moment. It seems to be something hereditary with the President. He served in our government for such a long time in different posts. He was the longest serving General Secretary of the party. However, he now disassociates himself from all done during that period. That is double-acting in politics.
SLPP is the only anti-government force. The SLFP-UNP political division disappeared with the elections on January 8, 2015. Instead of the UNP, a candidate was fielded under the swan symbol against Mr. Rajapaksa. So, it was a contest between Mr. Rajapaksa and the UNP-led force. The SLFP was formed as an alternative to the UNP by late Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike. Today, voters are either for Mr. Rajapaksa-led political force or against it. That is the divide line. Some people who were with us could not get nomination from us. Some of them joined hands with the SLFP. It appears to have created a split of the vote base at village level in certain instances.
QThe President is seeking a mandate to root out corruption. What is your view
There is nothing he did to eliminate corruption. The President contested the election as the common, apolitical candidate. He promised to bring about good governance. Yet, as his first task, he appointed someone who did not have parliamentary majority as the Prime Minister. He removed the Chief Justice thus deviating from the procedure. He brought back as the Chief Justice the lady who was once impeached by Parliament along with his vote. He never kept the promise that the Cabinet would be reduced to 25. He victimized Bhikkhus, politicians, government servants and war heroes. Corruption became rampant. The cost of road projects increased exorbitantly.
QHowever, the President appointed a commission on the bond scam and exposed it to the country. What do you say about it
It is not the President but the joint opposition that exposed it initially. It was done with the cooperation of the media and people. I have a feeling that the commission was appointed to sweep everything under the carpet. That is the original intention. Once fraud was uncovered, the government should have begun police investigations. Afterwards, action could have been taken to prosecute the wrongdoers through the Attorney General. Normally, a commission is appointed to probe cases that cannot be dealt with under the usual legal procedure. This is not something difficult to be investigated. This is a daylight robbery.
QBut, the commission was able to gather substantial evidence in its process
In a court of law, all such evidence has to be examined once again. Everything has to be started afresh.
QThe President said he started the second operation on the bond scam. What are your thoughts
I do not know whether it is appropriate for a leader to summon the Attorney General and give him instructions. Earlier, we were accused of keeping the Attorney Generals Department under the purview of the then President. What is happening now
I do not think it is morally acceptable to summon the Attorney General and instruct him on judicial matters. We have to assume that all cases filed by the Attorney General have been done at the instigation of the President. How does it conform to Yahapalana policies
It is wrong for any leader to summon the Attorney General. The Prime Minister also did it once and said it openly. The President is also the head of a certain political party.
QHow do you compete with the UNP at this election
Initially, we thought the UNP would be our main challenger. I now feel that even diehard followers of the UNP will not cast their ballots this time. The present UNP leadership did the gravest harm to the party. We have differences with the UNP in terms of its economic policy and the policy on national issues. Be that as it may, right from its inception under late Prime Minister D.S. Senanayake, UNPers maintained self-respect which has been totally compromised under the present leadership. The UNP secured political clout this time in a conspiring exercise. Yet, power gained through conspiracy could not be exercised for the benefit of the party. Today, there is no challenger for us.
QYet, the UNP has support of the government. They can use it for their advantage. What is your view
These local bodies will be constituted for a period of four years. They will remain under the current rule only for one year out of their four-year term. The Presidential election will be conducted next year. We are certain that power will be shifted to us. Then, these local bodies will be operated by our government. The elections to Provincial Councils are also due this year.
The local authorities remained dissolved for three years under the present government. They were run by special commissioners. There were severe concerns over garbage disposal, street lighting and Dengue prevention. The local authorities were unable to discharge their duties under the new government. It is the worst ever period in the history of local administration in our country. People did not receive any service from their local authorities after this government came to power.



These local bodies will be constituted for a period of four years. They will remain under the current rule only for one year out of their four-year term. The Presidential election will be conducted next year. We are certain that power will be shifted to us

QSeveral members who failed to get nomination from your party are contesting under different symbols. How will it affect your vote base
We cannot say it now. There are 5,092 members to be elected in respect of electoral wards. We will be affected by this in 200 wards. Today, the image of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is used for campaigning by three parties. He is the most popular politician. We have every right to use his picture. We are the rightful owners of his vision. The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) uses his image as the partys patron. There are independent groups using it. All these three political camps owe much to Mr. Rajapaksa. Finally, all should get together to defeat the UNP.
QAre you planning of contesting the next Presidential election
First, we focus on this election. Afterwards, there will be elections to the Provincial Councils. We will prepare for the Presidential election. It will happen.
QHave you identified the candidate
Not yet. It has to be decided by the party.
QMP Roshan Ranasinghe said it would be former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa. How true is it
That is a question to be directed at him. We as a party have not decided on it. It may or may not be the former Defence Secretary. Last time, we heard about the common candidate at the eleventh hour.
QWill you be adopting the same modus operandi
We will decide on it democratically.
QThe Presidents term is now limited to five years. What is your view
You see how the country was driven down the path of absolute disaster during the past three years. If the government remains for another three years, you can guess the predicament. Trimming down the term is good for the country.

MS right in reimposing liquor ban on women: Ruwanthi
	
Sri Lanka Podujana Party (SLPP) Kaduwela candidate and actress Ruwanthi Mangala yesterday commended Presidents directive on re-imposing the ban on women buying alcohol and being employed in bars.
In an interview with Daily Mirror, she said there were things that women should do and things they should not and the buying of alcohol and serving it were those that should not be done by women.
Ms. Mangala said many Sri Lankan families were suffering because of men being addicted to alcohol and pointed out that women should not be encouraged to consume alcohol.
She said when women work in bars, they tend to end up as victims of sexual harassment and women working in bars were likely to be misled to choose the wrong path.
Banning women from buying alcohol and being employed in bars is a prudent decision by the President. I know there are many so-called womens organizations that are speaking against the ban saying it is discriminatory and violated the fundamental rights of women, she said.
Eleven women including actress Samanalee Fonseka last week filed a fundamental rights petition in the Supreme Court seeking a declare that neither the Finance Ministry nor the State were entitled in law to revoke the Excise Notice dated January 10 in a manner which directly or indirectly prevents a woman from being lawfully employed at a place manufacturing and selling liquor. The petitioners said the prohibition was arbitrary, irrational, unreasonable and discriminatory to women. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Party leaders should decide the debate date: Speaker
	
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said today the date of the debate on the PCoI and PRECIFA reports would be decided at tomorrow's party leaders meeting.
Chief Opposition Whip and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said the debate should be held before February 10.
"The PCoI report has referred to the actions of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on the appointment of the former CB governor Arjuna Mahendran to the post," he said.
Mr. Dissanayake said the report had also referred to several ministers and had revealed that the EPF had incurred a loss of Rs.8 billion.
"This is a white collar robbery where a group of powerful people have robbed monies belonging to ordinary citizens of the country. One cannot expect justice from institutions such as the Attorney General's Department as those are controlled by the very people who had robbed public funds. Therefore those who are involved in the scam should be dealt with in Parliament," he said.
Mr. Dissanayake said he would prefer to question those involved, in the House itself.
Joint opposition MP Bandula Gunawardene said those who are responsible for the bond scam should be arrested forthwith.
"President Maithripala Sirisena has sought support of every one to penalize those who are involved in corruption, and we the joint opposition, are ready to support him in this endeavour," he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
