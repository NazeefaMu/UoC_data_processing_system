ComBank rated strongest bank by Fitch
	
		 		 
		 
			
The National Long-Term Rating of Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC has been affirmed at ?AA(lka); Stable Outlook? by Fitch Ratings Lanka (FRL).
Commercial Bank?s Basel II compliant outstanding subordinated debentures have been affirmed by Fitch at ?AA-(lka)?.
In a recent report, the agency said: ?Fitch considers Commercial Bank as the strongest bank in this peer group. Its rating captures its more measured risk appetite, solid franchise, sound track record, and strong funding profile. The bank?s provision coverage has been improving and asset quality has remained satisfactory. The ratings reflect our expectation that its operations in Bangladesh will remain small.?
?Sustained improvements in Commercial Bank?s asset quality and enhanced resilience against a volatile operating environment could be positive for the rating,? Fitch said.
The agency said the ratings could be downgraded if the Bank?s ability to withstand cyclical asset quality deterioration declines due to lower earnings and capitalisation. ?In addition, any marked weakening in its deposit franchise and a deviation from its measured risk appetite, both viewed by Fitch as key factors that differentiate Commercial from its lower-rated peers, would be negative,? Fitch said.
Commenting on the latest Fitch rating, Commercial Bank?s Managing Director/CEO Jegan Durairatnam said: ?We are pleased to be rated ?AA? by Fitch and to be acknowledged as the strongest bank among our peers. This speaks volumes of the capital strength, consistent performance, dedication to quality and long term vision of the Bank. Independent of Fitch, our operation in Bangladesh has also received the highest rating of ?AAA? given to financial institutions in that country, and this will further strengthen investor confidence.?
Commercial Bank operates a network of 243 branches and 613 ATMs in Sri Lanka and is the country?s largest private bank.?

DDFC to be re-launched as Sarvodaya Development Finance
	
Deshodaya Development Finance Company Ltd (DDFC), a subsidiary of the Sarvodaya Economic Enterprise Development Service (SEEDS) is due to be re-launched as Sarvodaya Development Finance Limited.?
Approved by the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), the company will continue to focus on micro financing and will function on the principles of the Sarvodaya Movement.
Commenting on the re-launch of the company, Chief Executive Officer of DDFC Ravindra Ranjith notes, ?Sarvodaya is already an established and strong brand name from the grassroots level to the business community. Practicing only the ethical financial principles established by the Founder of the Sarvodaya Movement, DDFC has been able to uplift families and communities, and help eradicate poverty in the country to some extent. With this relaunch we hope to broaden our scope of products and services, thereby being able to extend the services to serve greater target groups like the youth and small entrepreneurs in addition to the micro sector. This will be quite possible with the strength of the brand ?Sarvodaya? which has won the confidence of people in this country for many decades.?
The Lanka Jathika Sarvodaya Shramadana Sangamaya (LJSSS) was started nearly 60 years ago by Dr. A T Ariyaratne in the village of Kanatholuwa. Seeing the needs of the villagers there, Dr.Ariyaratne created a movement that would engage the people for the benefit of the people. During its first three decades, the Sarvodaya Movement was able ? initially without any assistance, and later within a framework of development cooperation with like-minded organisations ? to become one of the largest participatory organizations in this region if not the world.
With over 118,000 deposit customers and 52,000 small scale borrowers, DDFC operates 62 units island wide, 30 branches and 32 customer service centers.
The company?s strength over the years has been in the areas of financial inclusion, women?s empowerment, employment generation, and lending for economically viable projects. With 73% of the borrowers being women, SEEDS and DDFC have supported a countless amount of families around the island to uplift their living and economic conditions over the past 25 years.
Chairman of the Board at DDFC, Eastman Narangoda also expressing his views on the re-launch said, ?In order to ensure the sustainability of the Sarvodaya Movement, a sound financial firm is essential. SEEDS/DDFC has ensured that the Sarvodaya Movement has been able to carry out its mandate while also benefiting the nation. With this re-launch we hope to take that a step further and as a long term strategy to convert Sarvodaya Development Finance Limited in to a Development Bank that enriches people?s lives.?
In 2014, DDFC in a private placement allocated 20 percent of its stake to one of the 20 largest companies in Japan, Gentosha Total Asset Consulting Inc. DDFC is headed by a highly qualified and experienced Board of Directors who will continue to serve in Sarvodaya Development Finance Ltd too. The Chairman of the Board is veteran banker Eastman Narangoda while the Deputy Chairman is Channa De Silva. The board also comprises Dr.Vinya Ariyaratne, Dr.Richard Vokes, Dr.Indrajith Coomaraswamy, Shakila Wijewardena, Shevon Gunaratne, K L Gunawardana and Masayoshi Yamashita.

	Chairman of the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) D.E.W. Gunasekera said today that the Deputy Justice Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe had to withdraw the enjoining order that prevented the publication or circulation of the COPE subcommittee draft report on the sale of Central Bank Bonds in fear of the statement made by Prof. G.L. Peiris recently.
	Mr. Gunasekara said Prof. Peris had revealed in a news briefing that the COPE report would be submitted to the police when some of the UPFA MPs who were noticed gave statements.
	?Sujeewa was frightened that we would submit the report with the statements. If we did so it would be a public document. Sujeewa is in trouble as he followed the instructions of his Minister,? he said.
	Mr. Gunasekara said that it was Mr. Senasinghe who first spoke about the COPE report outside parliament and that it was a week later that they spoke about it.
	?Sujeewa did it to gain an advantage at the election campaign by talking about the bond issue. But he has fallen in trouble today,? he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)WATCH

Fitch maintains MCSL Financial Services? long-term rating on ?Watch Positive?
	
		 		 
		 
			
Fitch Ratings Lanka has maintained MCSL Financial Services Limited?s (MFSL) National Long-Term Rating of ?BBB(lka)? on Rating Watch Positive (RWP) as Fitch expects the merger of MFSL, MBSL Savings Bank Limited and Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka to be concluded within the first quarter of 2015.
Significant progress has been made since the merger announcement in March 2014, including securing the necessary shareholder approval at the extraordinary general meeting held on 13 October 2014, setting the share swap ratios and adoption of new articles of association. In addition, the surviving entity has been renamed to Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka & Finance PLC (MBSF).
MFSL was placed on RWP after Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka announced its proposed merger with MFSL and another company, all of which are subsidiaries of Bank of Ceylon (BOC: AA+(lka)/Stable).?
The RWP reflects Fitch?s expectations that MFSL, as part of the surviving entity MBSF, will be of greater importance to the BOC group than MFSL on its own. This is based on BOC continuing to be the dominant shareholder in the merged entity - Fitch expects BOC to directly own 74 percent of MBSF compared with its current 50.1 percent direct holding and 80 percent effective holding in MFSL.
MBSF will operate as a licensed finance company focusing on vehicle financing activities

Fitch upgrades and withdraws MCSL Financial Services? rating
	
		 		 
		 
			
Fitch Ratings Lanka has upgraded MCSL Financial Services Limited?s (MFSL) national long-term rating of ?BBB(lka)? to ?A+(lka)?. The outlook is stable.
Fitch has simultaneously removed the rating from Rating Watch Positive and withdrawn the rating as the company no longer exists. Accordingly, Fitch will no longer provide ratings or analytical coverage for MFSL.?
The rating action follows the public announcement on January 2, 2015 by Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka and Finance PLC (MBSF) that it has merged with MFSL and MBSL Savings Bank Limited (MSB). The merger of the three companies was registered with the Registrar-General of Companies in Sri Lanka on January 1, 2015.?
The multiple notch upgrade of MFSL?s rating reflects the reassessment of support to the merged entity from its 74.6 percent owner, Bank of Ceylon (BOC: AA+(lka)/Stable). MBSF will be the only licensed finance company that BOC owns that provides vehicle finance to customers who are not typically served by banks.?
The three notch differential between the ratings on BOC and the surviving entity reflects the latter?s limited role in the group, negligible profit and asset contribution and the absence of significant operational integration. Further, Fitch does not consider a disposal of the merged entity as being material for the BOC franchise with the merged entity being branded independently from BOC.

Govt. plans to privatise Litro gas-Bandula
	
Former UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardane said today that the government had given the green light to privatise state owned Litro Gas Lanka Ltd by signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Shell Gas Lanka Ltd.
Mr. Gunawardane said the government had signed a MoU with Shell Gas Lanka Ltd to purchase gas at US$105 per tonne, contrary to international tender procedure.
?34 companies had sent tendered to provide gas at lower prices while Shell Gas Lanka Ltd had quoted a higher price (US$ 122). However, the government, contrary to international tender procedure, signed an MoU with Shell Gas Lanka Ltd to purchase LP gas at US$ 105 following secret discussions with them even after the tenders closed. We ask how this was done, and who intervened in this deal?? he said
Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa took over the gas company which had been privatised during the tenure of Chandrika Kumaratunge and named it Litro gas.
He said this was the second biggest fraud of the new government, next to the Bond issue, and added that they would nullify this deal after coming to power. (Ajith Siriwardana)

	A Grama Seva Niladhari caught in the Akuressa election rally incident involving former President and Kurunegala district UPFA candidate Mahinda Rajapaksa, said today a drunken person who was behind him had grabbed the hand of Mr. Rajapaksa.
	GS Officer W. Wijesinghe, attached to the Telijjawila, Wandagoda Division of the Matara district, said this drunken person put his arm behind, and that at the same time, the crowd started showing. Then, he said Mr. Rajapaksa slackened his hand from this grab.
	?According to video footages, many assumed that I was grabbing the hand of Mr. Rajapaksa. I received several telephone calls from here and abroad inquiring about this incident,? he said.
	He also said state intelligence authorities had started recording statements from him.
	Elaborating further on what happened, he said, ?I went to the Akuressa town that day to pump fuel for my motorbike. Then, it started raining. I came to know that Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa was coming. I wanted to have a glimpse of him. Mr. Rajapaksa was proceeding towards the stage. Then, a drunken man behind me tried to grip the hand of Mr. Rajapaksa, with ringed fingers. The crowd was jostling at the time. Mr. Rajapaksa tried to untighten the grip at once. That is it. Yet, it went viral on the internet. Newspapers also published it. Most think I am the one who had a grip of Mr. Rajapaksa?s hand. Today, I am in a predicament not being able to walk on roads freely. I am exhausted after giving too many statements. I never though this will spin out of control to this extent. I do not know the person who was behind me at that moment.

NDBIB crowned ?Best Investment Bank in Sri Lanka? by Euromoney again
	
NDB Investment Bank (NDBIB) won the coveted ?Best Investment Bank in Sri Lanka? award for 2015 by the prestigious Euromoney Magazine.?
The award was presented at a gala ceremony held at the Island Shangri-La in Hong Kong recently, attended by global and regional powerhouses in banking and investment banking.?
With a legacy dating back to 1997, NDBIB has a proven history of leadership in Sri Lankan capital markets and has secured this award for four consecutive years since the introduction of Euromoney awards for investment banking in Sri Lanka. ?
Euromoney in a statement highlighted: ?NDBIB secures bragging rights as best investment bank in Sri Lanka for the fourth year in a row. It is the country?s largest full service investment bank and has raised US $ 140 million for clients through equity sales and debt prints over the past year.?
Vajira Kulatilaka, the CEO of NDB Capital Holdings, the holding company of capital market operations of the NDB group, stated, ?We are delighted to see the full service investment banking model coming into fruition. It?s heartening to see award-winning NDBIB securing numerous new mandates to provide best-in-class advice and services to clients whilst using the entire strength of the group to support transactions organised by NDBIB.?
NDBIB recorded a commendable performance for the year 2014, despite challenging capital market conditions. The company continued ?its ?dominant ?presence ?in ?both ?debt ?and ?equity ?capital ?markets ?in ?Sri ?Lanka ?having ?advised ?several ?landmark transactions ?through its diverse offerings. ?The total funds raised by NDBIB during the year 2014 for its clients amounted to Rs.30.2 billion.
NDBIB CEO Darshan Perera commenting on the award stated, ?We are indeed honoured and privileged to be awarded the Best Investment Bank in Sri Lanka for four years in a row. Euromoney award gives us both local and global recognition for our team and showcases the quality of their talent in investment banking and the confidence our clients have in us and our capabilities.?
He reiterated that this recognition substantiates NDBIB?s consistency in maintaining a high level of excellence in providing innovative solutions as well as the benchmark it has set for the peers in the industry.?
NDBIB COO Kaushini Laksumanage stated, ?We are honoured to receive the Euromoney award at this juncture. We?ve had a successful first two quarters for 2015 while maintaining market leadership for listed debentures. We?re increasingly looking at playing a regional role having already executed several cross border fund raising transactions.?
During 2014, NDBIB extended its ?market ?leadership ?in ?debt capital markets having ?raised ?a ?total ?of ?approximately ?Rs.21 ?billion, ?despite ?subdued ?market ?conditions ?caused ?by excess ?liquidity, ?availability ?of ?low-cost ?short-term ?funding ?and ?speculation ?on ?further ?monetary easing, with all issues being oversubscribed within hours of opening. ?
Further, NDBIB ?executed ?a ?pioneering ?Islamic ?banking ?product ?by ?successfully ?structuring ?and ?placing ?a Wakala facility for a company in the power and energy sector. ?Adding to its list of achievements, last year NDBIB acted as the manager and financial advisor for the acquisition of Hemas Power PLC (later renamed as Resus Energy).
NDBIB advised the management of Resus Energy on structuring a management buyout by putting together a consortium of equity investors, raising Rs.1.7 billion. NDBIB ?also arranged ?debt ?financing ?for ?the ?acquisition ?and ?acted ?as ?the ?financial ?advisor ?to ?the subsequent ?mandatory ?offer ?(as ?per ?Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) ?regulations). NDBIB has also been mandated to raise Rs.1 billion in debt financing to facilitate a restructuring of the Resus Energy group.
Marking ?a ?momentous ?leap ?in ?the ?capital ?markets, ?NDBIB ?was ?instrumental ?in ?structuring and initiating the launch ?of Sri Lanka?s largest and first PE fund with participation ?of ?multilateral agencies, the ?Emerald Sri Lanka Fund 1?, jointly managed by NDB Capital and Zephyr Management ?LP. The ?fund ?attracted ?prominent ?institutions ?such ?as ?IFC, ?DEG ?and ?FMO ?as limited ?partners ?raising ?c.US $ ?42.5 ?million. This is a rare instance in which such multilateral agencies have participated together.
NDBIB believes that the factors that supported capital raising in 2014 are likely to be sustained and be improved towards the latter part of 2015, propelling a fresh round of robust activity. Euromoney?s Awards for Excellence recognise institutions that demonstrate leadership, innovation and momentum in global financial markets. The accolades cover more than 20 global product categories and include best-in-class awards in all regions and recognitions for the best banks in close to 100 countries.

Video: More legal teeth to probe financial crimes: Rajitha
	
The UNP- led alliance today pledged to prioritize the enactment of legislation to deal with those involved in financial crimes and other wrongdoings under the regime of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, if it was elected to office.
?
Cabinet spokesman and Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne told the weekly news briefing that the only solution to the snail phased investigations and legal action against suspects who have allegedly committed financial crimes and misdeeds under the Rajapaksa regime was the setting up of a new legislative and legal administration system with enough legal teeth.
?
?We must accept that our legal system and activities at the Attorney General?s Department are not up to a satisfactory speed. That is why it takes several years if not months to complete investigations and take legal action against prima-facie cases of financial crimes. The best example is that only a very small number of cases have been filed against suspects who have allegedly involved in financial crimes and corruptions under the Rajapaksa regime so far,? Minister Senaratne added.
?
He said there were nearly 7,000 complaints on various financial crimes and corruptions against politicians and officials of the last regime but only 52 of them have been probed up to now. The Financial Crimes Division (FCID) and the CID await the Attorney General?s observations to file charges against suspects but the process was slow and added the AG?s Department work with a limited number of staff as there were a large number of staff vacancies at the Department.
?
If the complaints received by the FCID, the CID other and law enforcement agencies in the last six months on financial crimes and corruptions reportedly committed during the last regime were investigated under the current system, it will take more than two decades minimum to complete and file charges against the suspects.
?
?That is why we need a legal and judicial system to inquire, file charges and conclude the court cases speedily. Therefore, a new legal and legislative procedure is the need of the hour and the new government would give priority to introduce necessary laws as early as possible and added that would also provide answers to the opposition charge that no one accused by the UNP for misdeeds and corruptions has been convicted so far,? he said.

Video: Politicians misusing Mirihana incident: ?Api Ranaviruwo'
	
	An organization calling itself 'Api Ranaviruwo' yesterday that the recent incident involving the arrest of three army soldiers in Mirihana was been used by some politicians to gain a political advantage in the run up to the polls.
	Speaking at a media briefing that was organised by several retired senior officers of the forces, Colonel (Retd) Jayavi Fernando of ?Api Ranaviruwo? said that the unwarranted remarks made by some politicians had caused much frustration among the members of the army.
	?Statements of this nature should not have been made in this manner to ridicule the war heroes, Major General Prasanna Silva had done a yeoman service to the country during the war. He was among those summoned before the Geneva Commission and giving undue publicity to this incident will only help those who wish to tarnish the image of these officers," he said.
	Colonel Fernando said the remarks made by certain politicians that this incident posed a serious threat to the lives of the former President and the Defense secretary as it took place in Mirihana, where these VVIPs reside, clearly indicates that they were aiming to gain a political advantage in the run up to the polls. ?Such remarks will drive these war heroes towards the guillotine,? he said.
