AMCHAM/STAX?s actionable recommendations on positioning Sri Lanka as an attractive FDI destination
	
Rafi Musher, CEO, STAX Inc
?
AMCHAM, in collaboration with STAX, recently launched the 2018 whitepaper ?FDI Landscape and Investor Sentiment in Sri Lanka? at a gathering of business and government leaders including the Hon. Malik Samarawickrama, Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade.?
?
In addition to providing a definitive view of FDI statistics, the whitepaper interweaves expert insights from regulatory authorities to provide ten actionable recommendations for government stakeholders to enact.
?
Ten Actionable Recommendations:?
?
1) Clarity and consistency of data: Currently, there are multiple sources of FDI data, that is confusing to the international investor community. We recommend that the Central Bank, BOI, and other relevant agencies coalesce together and have one consistent reporting methodology on FDI.
?
2) Digitize data collection: At present, most FDI data is gathered via an island-wide paper survey. The need of the hour is to digitize the process of data capture to better enable the widest penetration of the survey and streamline subsequent analysis.
?
3) Ensure a representative sample: While sectors like manufacturing are traditionally well-represented in FDI surveys, the picture is incomplete. To develop a fuller view of Sri Lanka?s FDI position, there is a need to capture data on FDI inflows entering under-represented sectors like Technology/KPO/BPO.? In these sectors, most of the repatriable profits are reinvested into business expansion activities.
?
4) Develop one umbrella organization for FDI: Instead of having numerous line ministries with overlapping mandates for reaching out to global investors, there needs to be one central body capable of formulating policy, issuing guidelines, attracting investors and governing FDI flows.
?
5) Ensure long-term policy stability: About 59% of respondents surveyed in this report cited policy instability as a key barrier to conducting business. Changes in tax policy such as VAT rates, import duties and sudden shifts in economic strategy have all contributed to sending negative signals to prospective investors. Sustained policy stability is the need of the hour to provide a sense of clarity.
?
6) Negotiate favorable and clearly defined trade policies: Developing exports through Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and bolstering Sri Lanka?s position as a country with preferential access to markets like China, India and Europe, will be the cornerstone of establishing Sri Lanka?s attractiveness as an FDI destination.
?
7) Define and articulate Sri Lanka?s clear value proposition, across industries and capabilities: To attract FDI in a competitive global market, Sri Lanka needs to develop and communicate a clear and consistent value proposition to investors. Whether this value proposition relates to Sri Lanka?s strategic geo-political position or its access to talent, it is important that stakeholders reach a consensus and articulate the value proposition across industries and capabilities.
?
8) Improve transparency and corporate governance: Standards in areas such as corporate governance, government procurement, and transparency must be elevated in line with international practice.
?
9) Develop financial incentives to bring in capital across industries: Innovative financial incentives and grants are needed to further stimulate FDI across both capital-intensive and services-based industries.
?
10) Invest in education and vocational training to match industry needs and potential and improve productivity: At least 63% of respondents surveyed cited a shortage of quality labor. However, the problem isn?t necessarily a human resource shortage as it is a failure to fully develop the workforce and improve productivity of the existing labor force.?

CDS leaves for Mexico; request date from CID
	
Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne, who had been summoned to the CID today, had left for Mexico for official visit this morning.
Admiral Wijegunaratne had been summoned by the Criminal Investigations Department to give a statement today with regard to the abduction of 11 youths in 2008 and 2009.
CDS Spokesman Ruwan Premaweera said Admiral Wijegunaratne left the country to attend the 208th Independence Commemoration Ceremony of United Mexican States, representing Sri Lanka on the invitation of Mexican Defence Minister General Salvador Cienfuegos Zepeda.

Joining a people's struggle my favoured option-Wiggy
	
Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran said yesterday he would most favour quitting politics and joining a people?s movement to struggle for the rights of Tamils.
Mr.Wigneswaran told Daily Mirror yesterday that he had four options and joining a people?s movement would be what he favoured most.
Total retirement from politics, formation of a new party and joining another existing party are the other three options he mentioned.
Asked whether he had met with Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Leader
R. Sampanthan to discuss policy issues, he said he could not do so as planned. He said the meeting could take place after Mr.Sampanthan returns from a trip overseas.
He said following critical remarks made by him to the media there appears to have been a further polarization that had taken place within the TNA. (Kelum Bandara)

## Section: Opinion

JOINT UNHRC RESOLUTION 30/1: A RECURRENT THREAT TO SL?s SOVEREIGNTY
	
?
"Abolition of Presidency through Constitutional Reforms is another proposal"
"Constitutional Reforms are considered one of the major proposals"
"Yahapalanaya Govt accepted allegations levelled against Sri Lanka"
?
he allegations on Human Rights violations, war crimes, missing persons dereliction of rule of Law, accountability, devolution of power etc. and proposals for rectifying those alleged violations are considered the crux of Joint UNHRC Resolution 30/1 of year 2015.? ?
Allegations on Human Rights violations have been used as a common strategy by US and Allies to interfere with internal matters of countries which they have identified as vulnerable in the process of enforcing Global Power Politics. They have been used to implement their own agendas on the pretext of regularizing Human Rights records of those countries, the end result of which would be disastrous to the very existence of the countries concerned. Several instances could be cited to substantiate this premise from the history of Global Power Politics. US led Allied Forces have already launched the above strategy in Sri Lanka as well through Joint UNHRC Resolution 30/1. It may be noted that the new title given to UNHRC by the current US President is that ?it is a cesspit of bias politics?. It is appropriate time for Sri Lanka to review the credibility of Joint UNHRC Resolution 30/1 from that point of view. Joint UNHRC Resolution could be considered as a work programme or agenda of the conspiracy launched against Sri Lanka.?
?
"US and Allied Forces have realized that it was not possible for them to implement their agenda in this country as far as Rajapaksa Government remains in power"
?
US and Allied Forces have realized that it was not possible for them to implement their agenda in this country as far as Rajapaksa Government remains in power. Accordingly the first step of their conspiracy was to oust Rajapaksa Government and replace it with a pro-US weak leader. The second step of the above conspiracy launched against Sri Lanka has been initiated with the undertaking given by architects of Yahapalanaya Government to implement the proposals set out in Joint UNHRC Resolution 30/1, being its Co-sponsor along with US.?
Article 02 and 03 of chapter 01 of the present Constitution of Sri Lanka states that ?sovereignty is in the people of this country. People exercise this sovereignty through legislature, Executive and Judiciary?. In that context concurrence of the people of this country or Parliament would have been obtained for assumption of the role of co-sponsor to Joint UNHRC Resolution 30/1 and to implement the proposals set out therein. Assuming of the role of co-sponsor to Joint UNHRC Resolution 30/1 along with US could be considered a betrayal of sovereignty of the people of this country. Yahapalanaya Government has committed a traitorous act by doing so.??
Yahapalanaya Government has virtually accepted almost all allegations levelled against Sri Lanka and agreed to implement the proposals set out therein. The architects of Yahapalanaya Government boast that they have successfully built up an effective and friendly foreign relationship by doing so in place of hostile foreign relationship that was prevalent during the Rajapaksa Regime. This is a distortion of facts. Rajapaksa had determined to fight terrorist outfit irrespective of the repeated requests of US and allied Forces to go ahead with negotiations with the LTTE, due to the fact that it had become the absolute necessity of the hour, without which Sri Lanka would have been divided into two countries.? ?
Rajapaksa was well aware that almost all negotiations conducted with LTTE by Wickremasinghe in connivance with US and its allies ended up as utter flops. The attitude of US and its allies towards Rajapaksa Government had become hostile due to the fact that he had ignored their request above referred to and opted to save mother Lanka from the LTTE grip by eradicating it through Humanitarian operation.? ?
On the other hand the attitude of US and its allies towards Yahapalanaya Government had become friendly (as it says) due to the fact that Architects of Yahapalanaya Government have facilitated US and its allies on their own volition to implement the proposals set out in Joint UNHRC Resolution 30/1 being its co-sponsor.? ?
Constitutional Reforms, Reconciliation, Inquiry into war crimes, missing persons, restoration of the status-quo of Rule of Law, Accountability, Devolution of power, Updating of Human Right Record of Sri Lanka up to the standard acceptable to UNHRC and US etc. are considered main issues focused in Joint UNHRC Resolution 30/1. Let us examine the credibility of these proposals and what would be the impact of implementation of these proposals in this country?? ?
Constitutional Reforms are considered one of the major proposals. Need for a fresh constitution seemed two fold. It is not possible to implement the proposals set out in Joint UNHRC Resolution 30/1 under the present Constitution in spite of commitment given by Yahapalanaya Government being Co-sponsor thereto to do so. The Hybrid Court mechanism proposed to investigate and prosecute war crimes, abduction, missing persons etc. cannot be implemented within the definition given of the judiciary in chapter 15 of Present Constitution nor is it acceptable to the legal procedure of this country. For an instance there is no provision in this mechanism on applicability of the Evidence Ordinance in the process of evaluating admissibility of evidence available on missing persons. The other point is that devolution of power up to the level acceptable to the pro-Elam Tamil Political parties such as TNA, Tamil Diaspora and also to Joint UNHRC Resolution 30/1 cannot be implemented under present Constitution due to the fact that Articles 01 and 02 of Chapter 01 of the Constitution are clashed with that kind of devolution. Article 02 of Chapter 01 of the Constitution states ?The Republic of Sri Lanka is a Unitary State?. However the proposal set out in the Resolution 30/1 has been stressed on granting autonomous status for the Tamil Community in the North which could be lead to an irreparable crack on unitary status of Sri Lanka in the long run.? ?
Abolition of Presidency through Constitutional Reforms is another proposal. If this proposal is implemented it would pave the way for a weak Government under multi partisan politics and it could also intensify destabilization of this country due to lack of constitutionally empowered strong leadership under Executive Presidency.? ?
Replacing strong leaderships with weak and pro-US leaderships in the process of Global Powers Politics seemed to be one of the common strategies adopted by US and Allied Forces. Formation of Yahapalanaya Government is considered one of the classic instances of above tactic of US. Abolition of Executive Presidency seemed to be an accomplishment of the above strategy.??
In the process of Reconciliation, accommodation, collaboration and compromising of the views and proposals of each party above referred to with that of the views and proposals of the rest involved in Ethnic Conflict, evaluate them together and make a common solution acceptable to all parties who are involved in the conflicts are absolutely necessary. What is happening at present in the process of Reconciliation is that TNA, Tamil Politicians, UNHRC and Yahapalanaya Government have joined and dictate terms and conditions to the majority community disregarding the aspirations and views of the latter. In that context Reconciliation would serve no purpose other than dragging of conflict situation beyond the reasonable boundaries of resolution. Success of ongoing reconciliation process in that context seemed to be extremely blurred and discouraging.? ?
?
"Replacing strong leaderships with weak and pro-US leaderships in the process of Global Powers Politics seemed to be one of the common strategies adopted by US and Allied Forces"
UNHRC led by US and allied Forces, and pro-Elam Tamil Political parties led by TNA, Tamil Diaspora are considered stakeholders of the conspiracy against this country above referred to. Yahapalayana Government has involved in this team being co-sponsor to the Joint UNHRC Resolution 30/1 on its own volition. All of them have their own agendas based on their individual interests. US and Allied Forces are not prepared in any case to give up implementation of these proposals through UNHRC or directly by themselves. They have determined to use these proposals to ride on Yahapalanaya Government like rein being used to control horse. What would be the fate of this country under Yahapalanaya Government in such situation?? ?
In that context, implementation of the proposals of Joint UNHRC Resolution 30/1 would materialize the interest of its stakeholders. In serves no purpose of the masses of this country.??

Milk packets distribution vehicle belongs to Lottery Board: JO
	
The vehicle used to distribute the milk packets containing poisonous substance for the protesters of the Janabalaya Kolombata held on last Wednesday, belonged to the Lottery Board which comes under the Finance Ministry, Joint Opposition (JO) charged today.
Addressing a news conference, JO MP Shehan Semasinghe said they had sufficient evidence to prove that it was a plot by the Government to sabotage the protest.
?The vehicle (number plate of the vehicle is ND-3094) belonging to the Lottery Board has been used under the instructions of a top working director of the Board,
?It is questionable as to why Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera has not announced his stance in this regard because the Lottery Board comes under the purview of Finance Ministry,? the MP said.
?It was evident with the recent statements made prior to the protest by Minister Harin Fernando, Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayeka, and S. M. Marikkar related to their moves to supply food and beverages during the JO protest that the Government had hidden agenda to prevent the protest from taking place,? the MP added.
The JO members urged Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundara to probe into this incident and carry out an impartial investigation. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Plans to resume death penalty in SL disturbing: UN
	
Sri Lanka?s announced plans to resume the use of death penalty are disturbing, as are recurrent incidents of racist and inter-communal violence, the new UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said today.
In her opening statement to the Human Rights Council?s (HRC) 39th session which commenced in Geneva, Ms. Bachelet said the authorities in Sri Lanka had moved slowly towards meaningful implementation of the transitional justice agenda. However, she said the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) had now begun consultations and institutional capacity-building to fulfil its mandate.
?We look to that office to work quickly, to begin to provide answers to the families of the disappeared. Legislation establishing an ?Office for Reparations? is also underway. More progress in advancing accountability and truth-seeking could have great weight in the long-term stability and prosperity of the nation,? she said in her brief about human rights status in Sri Lanka.
Meanwhile, commenting on India, Ms. Bachelet hailed last week?s decision by the Indian Supreme Court to decriminalise same-sex relations.
?Laws that criminalise consensual adult relationships are, as Chief Justice Misra said, manifestly arbitrary and a source of discrimination and harassment. I very much hope other countries around the world will look to India?s example in this respect,? she said.
The 39th session of the Human Rights Council would be concluded on September 28. (By Lahiru Pothmulla)

Sri Lanka?s polity: A decade after the global Financial Crisis
	
?
he iPhone was the catalyst of the smart device revolution, first introduced in the June of 2007 by the Apple?s iconic CEO, lateSteve Jobs. A year later the fall of America?s fourth largest investment bank, Lehman Brothers triggered an economic meltdown of an epic proportion, making many drawing parallels to the great depression of the early 20th Century.?
The Great depression of the 20th Century, was a definitive moment that shaped outcomes of global political landscape, it reversed the achievements made by liberals in the Western world, especially that of liberal internationalism and its price project the League of Nations established as a collective security arrangement to prevent the break out of a second world war. The political impact of the economic crises was so deep it cleared the way for a wave of nationalism to take over Europe, mainly in Germany and Italy. The Nazi party won 37% of the vote in the July 1932 German election, which propelled Hitler into power.?
Liberal World Order
The WW II that followed shaped the political economic landscape of the 20th century and created a global order with all its idiosyncrasies, manage to prevail with liberal democracy as the leading framework of ordering international and domestic politics and economies. Events of the 21st Century are seriously challenging this established political and economic order. The first assault was on the security order with 9/11 attacks of 2001. The more wide ranging impact of the shakeup was the 2008 economic crisis that engulfed Wall Street and dragged most of the European economies down through secondary shocks.?
Financial crisis of 2008
The last decade can be identified as a decade of disruptions, the term disruption is not used in a negative sense in this article, it is used to provide as analytical framework to identify some of these global transformations that were triggered by the economic tsunami that overran most of the financial centres of the geo-political west. These disruptions within a limited span of time have unprecedentedly changed the global politics, economic, cultural and intellectual landscape.?
The primary victim of the 2008 debacle is the dominant liberal democratic governance framework which encompasses, values, ideas, institutions and intellectual vigour of the liberal project. The liberal project championed global governance, democratization of politics, liberalization of economics, expanded the rights regime but all the while waging a brutal war on any alternative in the name of democracy. George Bush invaded Iraq in 2003 in the name of democracy and regime change.?
What is central to understand is not the pure economics of the 2008 melt down but the larger socio political impact, Princeton University Professor of International Relations, Harold James, writing in a recent column argues that, Lehman Brothers? collapse revealed a flaw not just in finance, but in twenty-first-century politics and society.??
Plight of Liberal Democracy in the aftermath of 2008?
Liberal political systems thrived and grew exponentially after the end of the Cold war, yet the End of history momentum did not manage to contain or check the emergence of a global super class that controlled every aspect of social political life.? These new oligarchs, started dominating politics, education, media and decided over matters of war and peace. Liberal politics and institutions became the incubators and service providers to this super class, Joseph Stiglitz Christened it as the top 1% in the US.
This liberal political machinery kept on propagating post material values ranging from environmental rights, climate change to LGBTQ rights while at the same time corrupting political systems and hacking the liberal order into their own advantage. This mismanagement primarily back fired in the financial sector with the fall of Lehman Brothers exposing the underbelly of the subprime mortgage market in the US and a vast credit culture of Europe.
America unhinged
The crisis dented the primacy of the US in multiple ways and means and this is where it starts to be relevant to Sri Lanka. The economic crises affected the US in multiple ways it slowly but steadily started eroding its global standing and its long term reliability that most of its allies and friends depended upon for security. The US strategic posture and its military interventions we all rewired and the Obama administration had to create a strategy of the lighter foot print.?
Transformation of how wars were to be fought in the 21st century was significantly affected by these financial crises, technological disruptions enabled States to look at cheaper but effective ways of waging war by increasing dependencies on Cyber to autonomous systems designs. This is why there is an increasing dependency on robots at war from Drones in skies to autonomous submarines and missile systems.?
America?s ability to promote democracy and institution building encountered a local and global resistance from political groups that blamed the liberal political systems and its pluralism as the key culprit that weakened the political systems and leadership of Western nations.?
They attacked the core of liberalism claiming that good governance, global governance, post material values of liberalism had grossly undermined the role and life of ordinary Westerners as the liberal internationalist adventures had left behind a trail of poverty, stagnation, industrial demise in Western societies.
?
Europe unraveled
The rise of populist politics and a rebooted nationalist politics which became evident as the primary force of Western politics could be traced back to the 2008 financial crisis.? European politics leads the way, every European parliament today has a populist representation, and the alarming fact is that some of these parties are gaining support at exponential pace.?
Populist have strong presence in Greece, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Slovakia, and Switzerland where they account for majority of representative in legislatures. While the world focused on Brexit and Trump presidency as epitomes of the fast unraveling liberal ethics, it did not see the transformation of Austria.?
In Austria?s 2016 presidential election, Norbert Hofer, the far-right Freedom Party candidate did lose but he secured 46% of the vote. Macron may be the only liberal European globalist standing, but he had to fend of Marine Le Pen who received nearly 35% of the vote. Few days back in Chemnitz, one of the most accommodating Germany, witnessed clashes between far right groups and socialists. It also witnessed the far right wing groups calling for all foreigners to be attacked. Signs of a clearly faltering liberal regime throughout Europe, even in most stable democracies such as Germany.
?
Sri Lanka?s uncertain future
With the recent conclusion of a most anticipated protest by the newly established, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) in Colombo, what we are witnessing is a clear swing towards the rise of populist politics shaped by a resurgent nationalist idea. Sri Lanka?s political system and liberal institutions are facing the pressures of a waning liberal order, rising authoritarian, democratically induced dictatorships or nationalist regimes as alternatives which are seen as successful by Sri Lankan intelligentsia as benevolent models as in China, Malaysia, Philippines even Japan.
Populism has the capability to channel anger and resentment, its most successful as a protest movement, when it is in actual power it has a fundamental problem of institutionalizing its values. Populist movements in Sri Lanka and globally are successful as powerful political alternatives but are less capable when they come to office. Purely because any political movement that is not driven by coherent political will and with no clear political strategy can do more harm than correct the flaws they intend to fix.
The greatest tragedy in the crisis of liberalism of the last ten years since the global financial crisis is that, despite liberal political elites responsible for most of the political conflicts, erroneous nation building projects, devastation in the Middle East, the alternatives present do not seem to be capable of fixing our broken systems.?
The biggest danger in a volatile liberal system as in Sri Lanka at the moment is that of a total succumbing to the geo political rivalries and geo-political rivals increasing capabilities to shape the politics of this country.?

The Earth is dying - can we save her? - EDITORIAL
	
oday we are witnessing an ever-increasing number of natural disasters in the form of earthquakes, landslides, earth slips, flooding, droughts, wildfires and tsunamis occurring worldwide. Earlier this year in Greece, devastating wildfires killed around 85 people, while wildfires in California and in Sweden raged out of control and burned for days.?
In Kerala, India, unusually heavy rains during the recent monsoon led to landslides and floods which killed over 483 persons and around half-a-million persons had to be evacuated. In April 2015, Nepal was hit by an earthquake killing nearly 9,000 people. Over 22,000 suffered injury. The quake toppled muti-storeyed buildings in Kathmandu and created landslides and avalanches.?
In our own country last year (May 2017), we witnessed large-scale landslides and flooding which brought about widespread death and destruction. The Disaster Management Centre reported 100 deaths, 250,000 people affected, 71 houses destroyed and 163 houses were severely damaged by landslides and flooding after three days of continuous rainfall.?
No single country; whether it be the rich, developed or the poorest in Asia or Africa, has been spared by nature?s wrath, as human activity continues to damage the environment. A UN environmental study involving 1,203 scientists, hundreds of scientific institutions, and more than 160 governments, brought together by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) found degradation of the world?s natural resources by humans was rapidly outpacing the planet?s ability to absorb the damage - meaning the rate of deterioration is increasing globally.?
Studies have also shown that deforestation is one on the main causes behind the climatic changes leading to natural disasters, rising sea levels and the creation of holes in the ozone layer which protects us from the ultraviolet rays of the sun. Deforestation means less trees, less trees means less cleansing of oxygen, the displacement of the wildlife, changes in weather patterns, desertification and water scarcity. Deforestation also gives rise to a dangerous decrease in a natural fighter of global warming which leads to climate change and rising oceans. With sea levels rising from the melting of glaciers and icebergs. Scientists warn many small islands could be submerged.?
According the Union of Concerned Scientists, the Maldives is projected to experience sea level rise on the order of 1.5 feet (half-a-meter) -- and to lose some 77% of its land area -- by around the year 2100. If sea level were instead to rise by 3 feet (one metre), the Maldives could be almost completely inundated by about 2085.?
Achim Steiner, administrator of the UN Development Programme says, the world has lost over 130m hectares of rain-forests since 1990, and we lose dozens of species every day, pushing the Earth?s ecological system to its limit. ?Biodiversity and the ecosystem services it supports are not only the foundation for our life on Earth, but critical to the livelihoods and well-being of people everywhere.??
Between 2000 and 2012,? 2.3 million sq km (890,000 sq miles) of forests around the world were cut down. As a result of deforestation, only 6.2 million square km (2.4 million square miles) remain of the original 16 million square km (6 million sq miles) of forest that formerly covered the Earth. Forest cover world-wide which stood at 31.81 in 1990 was down to 30.825 by 2015. Forest cover in Sri Lanka has reduced by more than 3 percentage points. According to ?Global Forest Watch? between 2001 and 2017, Sri Lanka lost 154 kha of tree cover, equivalent to a 3.9% decrease since 2000. A rate far exceeding the international drop in forest cover of around 1%. Biologist Paul Ehrlich, has warned that civilisational collapse is a ?near certainty? in the next few decades due to the destruction of the natural world. As though this were not bad enough fumes from fossil fuel-based motor vehicles are creating holes in the layer of ozone, which protects the earth and all its beings from the ultra-violet rays of the sun.?
Plastic waste on the other hand is now even clogging sections of the ocean posing a danger to marine life. So, is our planet doomed? Is there anything we can do to protect this planet we call home??
The answer is YES! ?Yes We Can?, and Asia is showing the way. In northern Asia, forest cover has increased by more than 22% -- a result of tree-planting programmes mainly by China, where as a result of tree-planting programmes, forest cover has increased by more than 22%. As individuals we too can play an important role in protecting the Earth. We need to help farming families realise the danger of slash and burn agricultural practices which are denuding our forests.?
Every action counts. Let?s help save our planet.

The significance of Muharram
	
A procession to mark Muharram passes through in Jaipur, India?
"One of the sacred months according to Al-Qur?an as many events had taken place in this sacred month"
"These events have been recorded in the Holy Qur?an and Hadees (Tradition)"
?
Muharram is the first Arabic month in the Islamic calendar. The month of Muharram will fall on September 11 if moon is sighted.
It is one of the sacred months according to Al-Qur?an. Many events had taken place in this sacred month. These events have been recorded in the Holy Qur?an and Hadees (Tradition).
Once Allah the Almighty ordered Prophet Adam (Alai.) not to eat a fruit of a particular tree in the heaven. Then devil attempted to mislead him by saying several times that particular fruit is lawful for consumption. Ultimately Prophet Adam (Alai.) forgot what Allah said and ate the forbidden fruit. Due to wrath of Allah he and his wife Hawwa (Alai.) were thrown to the earth. Prophet Adam (Alai.) had repented for his fault for many years. He was forgiven by Allah in?this Muharram.
?
"A panegyric in the name of Imam Hassan (Rali) and Imam Hussain (Rali) has been compiled by His Holiness Mappillai Lebbai Alim (Rah.). The name of it is Hasanain Mowlidh. This Mowlidh is recited from the first moon to tenth moon of Muharram annually. Then a feast is given in the name of them at mosques and homes."
?
When Prophet Nuh (Alai.) was preaching the doctrine of Islam, people opposed him and troubled him in various ways. Then he prayed to Allah and asked Him to punish them. Then Allah ordered to make a huge ship. After his prayer, it rained for six months continually and the area was flooded. This flood was named Thufan Flood.
By the request of Allah, he told the people to get into his ship. Those who got into his ship were saved and others drowned in the water. Finally the ship reached the Jud Mountain. This event had taken place in Muharram.? Prophet Younus (Alai.) was swallowed by a whale. He had to live in its stomach for a certain period. He had recited Lallaha Illa Antha Subhanaka Innee Kunthu Minal Lalimeen, while he was in its stomach. He came out of the fish and was rescued in the month of Muharram.
When Prophet Musa (Alai.) was chased by king Pharaoh and his followers, he dipped his Asa (Rod) in the sea and several paths had been formed in the sea. Prophet Musa (Alai.) walked along one of these paths. When the Pharaoh and his followers attempted to catch him through this path, the sea covered the paths. The Kings men drowned in the water and died. Prophet Musa (Alai.) was saved without any harm. This had taken place in Muharram.
Once Imam Hussain (Rali) took part in the Holy Battle of Karbala. He was martyred in this battle in this sacred month. Fasting on 9th and 10th moon of Muharram is optional (Sunnah). A panegyric in the name of Imam Hassan (Rali) and Imam Hussain (Rali) has been compiled by His Holiness Mappillai Lebbai Alim (Rah.). The name of it is Hasanain Mowlidh. This Mowlidh is recited from the first moon to tenth moon of Muharram annually. Then a feast is given in their names at mosques and homes. It is optional to wear new clothes in this month. Let us celebrate this sacred month and commemorate the sacred events, which had taken place in it!??

## Title: The Sinha Ballet

The Sinha Ballet
	
A poignant drama, which?depends not on the spoken word but uses mime, dance and body language
?
?
	Uses a pure dance format as a vehicle for his ideas
	
	
	He has taken no major liberties with the original legend
	
	
	"Sri Lankans are more familiar with the traditional nadagama and its post-1956 version"
	
?
Nilan Maligaspe?s Sinha Ballet is a new interpretation of a familiar legend and should not be seen as a re-working of Ediriweera Sarchchandra?s Sinhabahu. Nilan uses a pure dance format as a vehicle for his ideas, with neither song nor spoken word, with changes of scenery and mood conveyed by lighting and an occasional projection instead of elaborate stage sets. It is both innovative and mentally stimulating.
He has taken no major liberties with the original legend which we are familiar with but gives it a new twist. Instead of a lion, we see a man. The king of Vagu and his queen Mayawathi are told that their only daughter Suppadevi would fall in love with a lion and beget children by him. Though they do their best to prevent this from happening, their worst fears come true and the two children of Suppadevi are named Sinhabahu and Sinhaseevali.
Sinhabahu eventually escapes from his lion father, taking his mother and sister with him. When the enraged lion begins devastating the countryside in revenge, the son confronts the father and kills him.
Whereas Sarachchandra took this story literally and gave it dramatic form, Nilan attempts to see the genesis of this spectacular folklore.
?
"Ballet is little understood in this country. The nadagama style adapted and further developed by?Dr. Sarachchandra is remote from the techniques and modern perspectives of modern ballet, where body language?is supreme"
He gives Sinhabahu a human form and avoids the use of lion masks till the very end when Sinhabahu appears with the bloodied head of his father, Sinha, who may have been a feared tribal leader.
The result is a poignant drama, which depends not on the spoken word but uses mime, dance and body language to achieve its end. Nilan Maligaspe is a hard-working choreographer, who has produced seventeen ballets since his debut production in 1998. This is his 18th.
As an artist, his dedication to his art is unquestionable and goes beyond the average artist?s involvement.? Apart from training his young prot?g?s in the intricacies of expressing a range of emotions through body language, he plans and executes everything to the minutest detail, from scriptwriting to directing, choreography, stage; lighting and costume design to even doing the laundry of his ensemble himself to save money. Recognition has come, both here and abroad. But it?s light from a jeweller?s lamp in the country?s whirlpool of art.
Ballet is little understood in this country. The nadagama style adapted and further developed by Dr Sarachchandra is remote from the techniques and modern perspectives of modern ballet, where body language is supreme.
Sri Lankans are more familiar with the traditional nadagama and its post-1956 version than with the more versatile modern ballet.? Even though the country holds State Ballet Festivals, even the theatre-going public, remain largely unaware of what is seen as an esoteric, fringe cultural activity.?
?
It takes an unusual degree of perseverance to perform so consistently in that context, and Nilan Maligaspe is a maverick, who has blazed his own stylistically individual path. He has been ably supported by a closely-knit team. The music for his ballets, as in this instance, is composed by Sanjeeva Paranamana, a faithful friend.
His youthful dancers, some of whom come from troubled family backgrounds, are loyal to him. That in itself is a feat in a sphere where ego conflicts are common and relationships volatile.
Though Nilan himself has played the Sinha role earlier, this time it was performed by Madushan Sabaragamuge. Suppadevi was played by Nipuni Jayasinghe and Sinhabahu and Sinhaseevali were played by Tharuka Jayaweera and Chamitha Weerabahu respectively.? Their roles as children were played by Anshupathi Perera and Divyanjali Abeywickrama, and the maid was played by Chamitha Weerabahu and the carter was played by Anurudda Rathnayake. Pethum Weerasinghe assisted with the script and production.

UNP to file legal action against MPs Shehan and Wimal
	
UNP MP Mujibur Rahaman today said he will file legal action against Joint Opposition MPs Shehan Semasinghe and Wimal Weerawansa for making false allegation that contaminated milk packets have been distributed by him during the opposition protest on September 5, 2018.
Mr. Rahaman told a media briefing that he will file legal action against the two Joint Opposition MPs as per section 28 of the Penal Code. ?I can file action against the two MPs for the statements they have made against me outside Parliament and will do so. It is possible to file action against someone as per section 28 of the Penal code for making a false allegation. One is subjected to two years imprisonment or to a fine if found guilty of making a false allegation against someone and I will be making use of this provision and would file legal action,? the MP said.
Meanwhile, UNP Spokesman Minister Harin Fernando and Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara who also participated in the briefing said they have asked the IGP to probe the allegation made by the Joint Opposition. ?We have also lodged a complaint with the Mirihana Police and have asked for probe on the allegations,? Deputy Minister Bandara said.
?Joint opposition is coming up with a false allegation to cover up its failure on September 5. They said they will topple the government but ended up becoming a bunch of drunkards. After that they will blame us for giving contaminated liquor,? Minister Fernando said.
Responding to a question raised by the journalists as to whether the government could prove that joint opposition leaders stayed at five star hotels in Colombo on the night of its protest, Minister Fernando said there are video clips of joint opposition leaders going to the hotels in their vehicles.
Deputy Minister Bandara said the government would have got the police to fire tear gas at the protesters if it wanted to disrupt the protest and would not resort to do things under cover. (Yohan Perera)

Vocational Education and Training: A feasible alternative for Sri Lanka
	
?
"Vocational education should be oriented to?the manpower need of the country"
"Vocational education is economic education"
"Every person is important and?has dignity and right to be educated"
"Pupils at all levels should have some occupationally oriented education"
?
Due to the technological change in concrete terms have led to rapid introduction of modern technology in every sphere of economic activity. The rate of change has also led to continuous changes in education and occupation. These changes have been occurring in different directions and different speeds compared to changes in education system.?
When most students have to be educated up to the age of 16 or 18, it is imperative that education imparted. especially in later years, should be linked with their working life. At early stages of technological transformation of society, the skill profile is pyramidal. most of the jobs would be at the base of pyramidal requiring small preparation in terms of education and skill development. At later stages the structure tends to become urn-shaped with maximum workers at the middle level of skills with concomitant requirement of education and skills. Vertical specialization become an important feature and differentiated entry points in occupational areas emerge. The stratification occupational levels has given rise to three levels of education namely, vocational, technical, professional.
Concept of vocational education??
Vocational education is specific career or trade excluding the professions. Vocational education sources on practical application of skill learned and is generally unconcerned with theory or traditional academic skills. A large part of the education in vocational institutes is learned on training. Vocational training of those provided a link between education and working world. It is usually provided either at the high school level or in a post-secondary trade school.?
Principles of Vocational Education??
Vocational education is based on the following principles.?
?
(a) Every person is important and has dignity and right to be educated. Society has responsibility to give every youngster the appearing to develop to the fullest extent of his capabilities.(b) Vocational education is economic education as it is geared to the need of job market and those contribute to national economic strength.(c) Vocational education can develop a? ?marketable man by developing his ability to perform skills that extend his utility as a tool of production.??(d) Vocational education is an education for production to serve the end of economic system and is said to have social utility.(e) Vocational education at the secondary level is concerned with preparation of the individual for initial entry employment.(f) Vocational education should be orient to the manpower need of the country.(g) Vocational education should be evaluated on the basis of its economic efficiency.
?
In the history of vocational education, a number of definitions have emerged.?
Smith Hughes defines vocational education on that education ?which is under public supervision or control that the controlling purpose of such education shall be to fit far useful Employment. That such education shall be of less than college grade and that such education be designed to meet the needs of persons over fourteen years of age who have entered or who are preparing to enter work? (work of the farm trade of industrial per unit)??
George Deen the George Barder did not appreciably change the definition but added more disciplines and services. They also provided for federal funds to be spent to distribute occupations. Salaries and counsellors and research.
Apart from that education for work ? a report on the current scene in vocational education, spend out a frame work which postulates the followings.
?One objective of education for and youth be preparation for occupation.
Pupils at all levels should have some occupationally oriented education.?
Such schooling on the part of the core of all education should touch all of the capacities of all individuals and it should be viable in a rapidly changing technological society.
It should be open ? entered not terminal and? ?
It should be recognized a providing only part of the total continuing educational input to an occupational career.
Constrained present vocational education on system: Zero ? sum problem - Young students are attached toward the stream because of the advantage or incentives it offers Especially those related to the labour market in forms of jobs, income on career prospects. Therefore, an improved incentive in one part of the system must be matched by reduced incentive elsewhere.??
Labour market recruitment and training - Education policy makers are unable to influence the way labour market incentive are distributed in relation to participation and attainment in education. They have little control over selection process and the resulting market. Signals conveyed to future students.?
Institutional inertia -Educational institutions do not easily restructure themselves. Vested interests and expectations are slow to change.
Learning -Enable students to acquire the knowledge and competencies required at their destinations. They must take account of changing skills demands and the way tasks and skills are combined within occupations.
Mismatch Between Education and Occupation
Lack of congruence between number of young people completing a program and occupational opportunities create mismatches and unemployment.
Operationally, the extent of mismatch between education and employment is measured by the following indicators as follows.
The correspondence between the aggregate supply of occupational skills and distribution of employment across occupation.
The extent to which individuals entering the labour market find employment in occupations related to their field of study.
Other labor market indicators such as the rate of return or more simply earnings or employment rates of young workers from different disciplines or trades.
Evidences of skill shortages or recruitment difficulties experienced by employees.
In the ?Sri Lankan? Context
Sri Lankan vocational education system has been introduced by British in 1893, Initially to train the blue colour personnel to run the railway and the tea factories.
urrently, Sri Lanka?s Technical Vocational education training is characterized by multitude of agencies including training program of public and private sectors.
tandards and curriculum development agencies and regulatory body. Which is the tertiary and vocational education commission. Operating under the preview of the ministry of vocational training and skill development. National Apprenticeship and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA) and the University for Vocational Technology (UNIVOTEC) previously had been known as the national institute of technical education Sri Lanka.?
In Europe, Vocational Education and Training (VET) are considered necessities and prepared skill for professional jobs. Large scale companies hire vocationally trained all individual who prosess the strength and soft skills experiences and the job training needed to the challenges in day to day work environment.?
Because of this youth unemployment and unemployment related problems remain relatively low in Europe specially, Germany and Switzerland considering other counties such as India and Vietnam are looking for similar mechanism to overcome unemployment and to strengthen their economics through a workforce that has been empowered by vocational training.
?
"In Sri Lanka, vocational training follows the dual programmes where students obtain on the job training as well as work experience the three year programme consist of theoretical as well as practical component"
?
Unfortunately, in Sri Lanka for instance most companies and public sector institute will hesitate to recruit an employee without a degree despite having the advantages On the Job Training (OJT) skills and learned knowledge.
In Sri Lanka, vocational training follows the dual programmes where students obtain on the job training as well as work experience the three year programme consist of theoretical as well as practical component. Sri Lankan public and private sector organizations will also tend to get this advantage of this trade. By following the European System, it will shift the onus from the government sector to private sector to provide training to the youth of the country. Because the private sector identified needs and is also able to adopt the training to changing requirements. However large private sector companies including. ICC, Sanken and public sector institutes such as SEC, CECB have played pivotal roles and active parts in training, interning and recruiting students from university colleges and VET centres throughout Sri Lanka.
Many of these trainees have gone on to make a significant difference to their centres and changes to their life style as well. Some of them have faced lucrative employment overseas.?
