A discovery that has raised a security concern!
	
It has come to light recently that a certain security high up known to be a close pal of a former political leader is the occupant of a house located close to the Crescent Place residence of a political authority in the highest echelons of the government.

Even the security top brass of yahapalanaya had not been aware of this sensitive position until a deputy purohita had made the disclosure during a recent visit to the high political authority.
Even the allocation of this house to this security high-up by the previous regime came in for flak from opposition sources, who condemned it as an act of favoritism.
Meanwhile, a government authority had ordered a probe into the allocation of this house to the security high-up in violation of the relevant regulations.

## Title: Fitch affirms HNB Assurance and HNB General Insurance ratings

Fitch affirms HNB Assurance and HNB General Insurance ratings
	
Fitch Ratings Lanka has affirmed HNB Assurance PLCs (HNBA) National Insurer Financial Strength Rating and National Long-Term Rating at A(lka).
Fitch has also affirmed its subsidiary HNB General Insurance Limiteds (HNB GI) National Insurer Financial Strength Rating and National Long-Term Rating at A(lka). The Outlook on the ratings is Stable.
The ratings reflect the Sri Lanka-based insurance groups satisfactory capitalisation in terms of risk based capital, prudent investment policy and modest market share.
The ratings also reflect synergies gained from using its parents, Hatton National Bank PLC (HNB, AA-(lka)/Stable), wider branch network, HNBAs importance to the bank in providing bancassurance products and HNBs 60 percent stake in the insurance group.
Fitch considers HNB GI a core subsidiary of HNBA, due to the significant contribution non-life insurance makes to the top line (49 percent of gross written premiums) and significant operational synergies.
Fitch views HNBAs consolidated capital strength as satisfactory. In 2015, its life solvency ratio was 2.2x (2014:2.3x), while its non-life ratio weakened to 1.5x (2014:3.1x) due to lower profitability resulting from high competition.
The regulatory minimum ratio was 1.0x for both life and non-life. In 2015 HNBAs pretax return on assets reduced to 1.5 percent (2014: 4.9 percent), as the non-life combined ratio deteriorated to 123 percent from 110 percent in 2014. The increase in the ratio was mainly due to the motor insurance claims.
In November 2015, HNBA provided HNB GI with Rs.150 million of capital to support its solvency until HNB GI arrests its weak profitability.
HNBA and HNB GI have been recording above-sector growth in the last couple of years. Fitch generally views growth at rates greater than the market or peers cautiously from a ratings perspective, especially during periods of competitive pricing pressures. From 2016, insurers will be required to report RBC positions. HNBAs life and non-life RBC ratios were 282 percent and 177 percent respectively at end-2015. HNBA expects its life and non-life business segments to maintain RBC ratios of at least 170 percent. This compares with a regulatory minimum of 120 percent.
Although Fitch does not expect the Sri Lankan insurance sectors credit profile to deteriorate materially, Fitch is of the view that operating conditions could become more challenging. Fitch downgraded the Sri Lankan sovereign to B+ from BB- and assigned a Negative Outlook on 29 February 2016.
The operating environment remains a key rating driver for the Sri Lankan insurance sector, given its potential volatility.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will contest at the next presidential election if President Maithripala Sirisena does not contest for a second term, SLFP Spokesman Dilan Perera said today.
While taking oaths as the sixth executive president of Sri Lanka, President Sirisena had vowed not to contest for a second term. If he does not contest the presidency for a second term we will have to find another candidate to contest in his place," he said.
Mr. Perera said two ministers from the United National Party (UNP) had mentioned Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's name to the media as the next presidential candidate.
With the 19th Amendment to the Constitution being now operative, former Presidents Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and Mahinda Rajapaksa are not qualified to do so, he said.
Mr. Perera said there were no any legal barriers for President Maithripala Sirisena to contest the presidential election.
For this purpose we should strengthen the SLFP, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

US assures $40 million assistance to SL
	
U.S. Ambassador Atul Keshap said that U.S. Government assistance to Sri Lanka totaled approximately $40 million last year and they had requested similar amounts in the coming years as a result of Sri Lanka's commitment to good governance.
He said the Millennium Challenge Corporation was working to design a threshold program that can potentially unlock millions of dollars in additional assistance to boost economic growth in Sri Lanka.
American relations with Sri Lanka are at an all-time high. As President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe lead their government in moving ahead with needed constitutional reform, reconciliation, and fulfilling their United Nations commitments, we on the part of the American government will also continue to partner with your government as it works to rebuild the economy, advance good governance, and ensure that all Sri Lankans can enjoy equal rights, equal opportunities and the full benefits of post-conflict development regardless of their ethnicity or origins, Mr. Keshap said.
He expressed these views in Polonnaruwa last Thursday during the four-day visit by Director of the Office of U.S. Foreign Assistance Resources Hari Sastry and Director for F/SCA Brendan Dallas. 
He said that Earlier this year, our two governments launched the U.S.-Sri Lanka Partnership Dialogue, which expands and reinforces our whole-of-government cooperation in development, governance, energy, trade, and security. Just last week, the United States House of Representatives Democracy Partnership Staff Delegation wrapped up a visit to Colombo, during which they successfully laid the groundwork for the Sri Lankan Parliament to join the program that works directly with 17 partner legislatures and parliaments around the world to support peer-to-peer exchanges and training seminars between partner legislatures.
Mr. Keshap said the United States Agency for International Development was providing funding as well as technical and managerial assistance to small and medium scale entrepreneurs in Polonnaruwa district, to develop their enterprises, create jobs and strengthen economic growth in the region.
We are working with the government and the private sector to improve traditional farming practices, ensure food security and strengthen livelihood opportunities in dairy, poultry and horticulture for more than 3,000 families, especially those of small scale farmers, he said.
He said they also planned to develop several new programs at the request of the Sri Lankan government to include programming in the sectors of youth employment, public finance management, strengthening governance, and improving the business climate for foreign investment.
