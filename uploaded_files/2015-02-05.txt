A brand new opposition political front in the offing?
	
	
	It was, no doubt, a powwow of great political significance, perhaps reminiscent of the historic Yamuna conference the way back in early fifties that laid the foundation for uniting scattered opposition forces and founding of the SLFP.? 
It was held at the residence of the offspring of the ?Boralugoda Lion? who took over his father?s mantle.? The main participants in the discussion other than the host were the bearded red maverick who ended his revolutionary politics as a docile follower of the deposed Big Boss, the vociferous ?patriot? of fast-unto-death fame and the Western council member of ?double cross? fame.? The powwow got added significance when the deposed Big Boss walked in to a hero?s welcome when it was in progress.
However, the deposed Big Boss was more an observer than an active participant in the discussion, they say.
Birds of a feather had dispersed after reaching agreement to meet again to work out their political agenda.
It is widely believed that this conference of opposition stalwarts is a clear pointer to the founding of a brand new political front to take on the Maitri regime.

An early disappointment for a crossover
	
	
	This one is a great pal of the new Minister in charge of high flying activity at the ?state? level.
The other day this pal called at the head office of an institution coming under the Ministry and made it known to all and sundry that he would be shortly taking up duties as their new boss.
The would-be new boss soon after was deluged with congratulatory messages from friends and well-wishers. ?
Two days later another person ? a respected leading figure in the corporate sector ? appointed by the Minister at the Cabinet level in charge of the same subject assumed duties as the head of this establishment. ?
Greatly chagrined by this unexpected move by the one above him, the Minister at the ?State? level had sent in his resignation. But it has not been accepted, they say.

Video: Cabinet approval for National Medicinal Drugs Policy
	
The Cabinet on Thursday unanimously approved the long-awaited National Medicinal Drugs Policy (NMDP) or the amended Senaka Bibile Drugs Policy to be presented in parliament to regulate and reduce the prices of drugs in the country.
The Cabinet proposal was submitted by Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senaratne.
The National Medicinal Drugs Policy will be presented at the next parliamentary session after the Tobacco Bill is presented.
?Once the Drugs Policy is enacted, all the medicines will have to be imported and prescribed under their generic names and not under their trade names,? the minister told the Cabinet news briefing. ?
He said drug prices will be drastically reduced once the policy was enacted with the prices of some medicines being reduced to one-third their price and some medicines to 25 per cent of their previous price.? ?
"At the initial stage doctors will be allowed to include the trade name of medicines within brackets followed by the generic name if they wish to and have faith in the brand. Gradually we will implement measures to import and prescribe only under the generic name," the minister said.
He said the policy was a complicated and therefore needed to be implemented carefully after drafting it properly.? (Lahiru Pothmulla and Sanath Desmond)WATCH

?
	Douggie of the North and Atha of the East who found themselves on the horns of a dilemma following the unexpected defeat of the Big Boss are said to be still groping for a path that would take them to some political haven.
Both Douggie and Atha quite used to swimming with the current have sought to be part of the national unity government. However, their requests have been politely turned down by the bigwigs of the new government. The reason is something very obvious: Haq Kim and Atha are such bitter rivals now no coalition would be big enough to accommodate both; and the main Tamil alliance will not want to have anything to do with a government with their archrival Douggie on board.
So Douggie and Atha have no other alternative than to team up with the alliance to be formed by a group of diehard loyalists of the deposed Big Boss, they say.?

	Many Diyawanna members who once switched their allegiance to the Betel Leaf are now making overtures to the Green party leaders hoping for a welcome return to the fold.
Meanwhile, some politicos are said to be striking bizarre deals in a bid to brighten their political prospects.
For instance, a senior Green party politico gone into involuntary retirement following his defeat at the last Parliamentary elections had approached a young former Green Diyawanna member now turned Blue with a strange proposal. ?Look here, son?, he addressed the young politico. ? Parliamentary general elections are only three months away. If I can enter the fray as a Minister, my chances of winning will be much better. Can?t you stand down to make way for me to enter the Diyawanna council? I consider it a great favour.? If you give way, my becoming a Minister is just a matter of course!?
The senior politico also assured the young one that he will return the favour with a huge bonus after the coming elections. ?You will never?? regret doing me this favour,? he added.
It did not take long for the young politico to say a firm ?no? to this request.? After all, he knew one bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. ?

Video: Govt. called exiles back to arrest them ? FSP
	
Charging that the government had gone back on its stance to bring back those who were politically exiled, Propaganda Secretary of the Frontline Socialist Party Pubudu Jagoda yesterday said that government officials were handling its leader Kumar Gunaratnam who had come back to engage in politics.
Speaking at a media briefing Mr. Jagoda said that though JVP dissident Kumar Gunaratnam had stated that the reasons for his visit were political, he was nevertheless issued only a tourist visa and is now being threatened of deportation for violating conditions of the visa
??He was involved in politics when he was here and he wanted to come back for politics. He made this known to the officials of Immigration and Emigration and even then they issued only a tourist visa,? he charged.
?He is not a tourist and we all know that. He did not leave the country by choice, he was forced to leave and now he wants to come back?
?Mr. Jagoda alleged that though elaborate statements had been made by cabinet ministers calling for the return of exiled and politically victimized individuals, the government intended only to arrest them upon arrival or oust them once again.
?The media minister made a statement inviting all those who were in exile back to the country, but we see that they called them back only to arrest them,? Jagoda said.
?The Central Bank governor is a Singaporean citizen left in charge of matters with the Treasury, but after ousting Kumar they say he?s an Australian and try to keep him out of the country"
He further stated that the government is not abiding by its policies of good governance and is selectively applying it where it is expedient to do so.
?The government must tell us whether it had changed their policy or never intended to adhere to it in the first place,? Jagoda said. (Jehan Gunasekara)WATCH

The Government said today it would go ahead with the Chinese-funded Colombo Port City Project saying that the initial studies on the project including the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report were found in order.
Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Rajitha Senaratne said President Maithripala Sirisena will discuss the modalities and the logistics of the project during his visit to China next month soon after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visits Sri Lanka.
?We have decided to allow the development projects to proceed but without any fraud or corruption. The EIA on the project was carried out by the Moratuwa University, which is known for its assessment quality. However, a few more details of the Port City Project still need to be clarified,? he told the Cabinet news briefing.
The minister said the percentage of ownership of the project and the leasing terms would be discussed and clarified with the Chinese company which is handling the project.
When asked about Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe?s statement he made during the presidential election campaign to scrap this project, the minister said he was speaking on behalf of the President.?? (Lahiru Pothmulla and Sanath Desmond)WATCH

	This particular Diyawanna member campaigned for the victory of the Compassionate One with his heart and soul.
Soon after the Compassionate One was installed in office, this diehard loyalist made an unusual request to the Compassionate One:? that he be assigned an office room in the main secretariat. This request placed the Compassionate One, now the new Big Boss, in an embarrassing position. Because there is no precedent for allocating office rooms to Diyawanna members in the secretariat meant only for his staff. So the Compassionate One had to reject this request.
The new Bog Boss was feeling sorry that he could not accommodate the request of his loyalist. After all, there is a way if there is a will, they say. And suddenly it occurred to him that there was a way to grant the Diyawanna member?s request without compromising any standard procedure, policy or principle.
The Diyawanna member was appointed as a senior consultant and now he has got an office room in the secretariat which he is entitled to by the virtue of his new position!

More taxes on CSN of Rajapaksa sons
	
Carlton Sports Network (CSN), a dedicated sports channel operated by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa?s sons, is among the companies to be levied under the Super Gain Tax introduced by the Government, Parliament was informed today.
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake, who opened the debate on the interim budget, said this tax was introduced to charge a levy from some companies that prospered disproportionately during the tenure of the previous government while making a minimum contribution to the economy.
He cited CSN as an example and said it had neither paid the spectrum tax nor the electricity charges.
"CSN has usurped the sports telecasting rights of the state-run television channels and misappropriated the fleet of vehicles assigned to the Presidential Security Division (PSD) for its business operations. That is how it has made huge profits," the minister said adding that one-fourth of the income accrued by these companies will be charged as tax if they had made a profit of Rs.2,000 million or more during the financial year 2013/2014.

SLFP to support mini-budget
	
	The main opposition, Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) said today it would support the interim budget presented by the new government with a host of measures to give relief to the people.
	Opposition Leader Nimal Siripala de Silva during the debate on the interim budget said there were populist measures announced in the budget to cushion the cost-of-living burden and as such his party would support the budget.
	He said his party would make a constructive criticism on some of the budgetary provisions which seem unrealistic.
	"This is nothing new but an alteration of the budget we presented. The new government has cut some of the allocations we made and used them to increase allocations to some other sectors. Anyway, this budget can be passed only with the support of the opposition. Therefore, we also deserve credit for it. Without our support, the budget will not be realised," Mr. de Silva said.
	He said it was questionable whether the government could raise sufficient revenue to meet the expenditure which would result in handing out these benefits.
	"The government has announced Rs.20,000 for an expectant mother. Annually, around 400,000 babies are born. It means the government needs Rs.8 billion for this purpose but only Rs.2 billion had been allocated," he said.(Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)

?The then opposition politicos and civil society activists also made it a point to meet the wife and children of the disappeared journalist very often to share their grief and assure them of their solidarity with their relentless effort to find a clue as to what had become of their loved one.
The wife and children of the disappeared journalist along with a small group of sympathizers staged a demonstration as usual opposite the Fort railway station quite recently; this time round to call on the new government to resolve the mystery shrouding the disappearance of their loved one.? However, most activists who were with the family spearheading the agitation for government action to unearth the missing journo were conspicuous by their absence at the recent demonstration.
Highly disappointed over the sudden change of attitude of the long- standing advocates of her cause, the aggrieved lady had opened up her heart even to a highly respected monk dedicated to the mission of ushering in a just society.
Meanwhile, they say that the case of the missing journo does not figure among the probes relating to media suppression during the past regime set to be launched.
