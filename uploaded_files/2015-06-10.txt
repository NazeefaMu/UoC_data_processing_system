A parallel to the fable about the fox and the grapes
	
There is a certain former Ministerial one stranded between two worlds. If he vows now to stand by the deposed strongman, he would next moment predict the victory of the Green party at the coming election as if it is his singular wish. ?
It is a well-known secret that this politico who somersaulted to the Betel leaf camp from the Green party at the most opportune moment is now poised to make a U-turn.? A popular teledrama actress is said to be busy these days clearing his way back to the Mahagedara.
The actress had visited the Mahagedara of the Greens thrice, but had returned empty handed as both Nuwara Kiri Aiya and Kegalle Kabir had objected to the prodigal being given party nomination to contest from their districts.
Meanwhile, the former Ministerial one had said in disgust that politics had become too bitter for him.
Reacting to the disappointed politico?s utterance, a Green party stalwart had quipped: ?A typical parallel to the fable about the fox and the grapes!?

Australia 'paid to turn back boat' with Lankans
	
Australian officials had allegedly paid tens of thousands of dollars to people smugglers to turn a boat full of asylum seekers including Sri Lankan refugees back to Indonesia, Fairfax reported on Wednesday.
A boat carrying 65 people from Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Myanmar, who were seeking asylum in New Zealand, was boarded by Australian custom officers in late May.
Asylum seekers on board the boat described being kept in ?jail-like conditions? on a navy ship as navy and Customs officials intercepted, before the boat was turned around and sent back to the Indonesian island of Rote.?
There, the local police chief alleges the six crew members were given $US5,000 each by Australian custom officials.
The Rota police chief said he saw the money himself, wrapped in six black plastic bags when the crew was apprehended for their people-smuggling operation.
Immigration Minister Peter Dutton has denied the claims and refused to answer questions on the matter.
A letter detailing the allegations was signed by all 65 asylum seekers on board the boat and delivered to the New Zealand government.
The letter said officials had paid at least $7000 to each of the six crew members.
One of the asylum seekers on board the boat, Nazmul Hassan from Bangladesh told Radio New Zealand the boat twice encountered New Zealand officials, and those on board were told Australia ?wanted to donate for us to go back to Indonesia?.
The asylum seekers reportedly swam ashore after their boat hit rocks in the West Rote district of Indonesia, after the crew agreed to turn the boat around.
Speaking from a detention centre in West Timor, Mr Hassan said he and the rest of the group were ?mentally very upset?.
Former Immigration Department Executive Peter Hughes told Fairfax if the payment was true it would be unprecedented.
?I have never heard of that happening before,? he said. (news.com.au)

The bearded loner of the Old left is in an ugly mood these days.? He attended a recent media briefing held by the Betel leaf rebel group. Several fringe political party leaders supporting the deposed strongman had been invited to the briefing.
The sulky loner breezed in as the briefing was about to get underway and his glance immediately fell on a certain politico among those seated at the head table. The presence of this character descending from the Urumaya clan now leading an imitation grouping visibly got the loner?s goat.
?Who invited this fellow to this media briefing?? the loner barked. ?If he remains here, I will walk out!?
A highly embarrassed former Ministerial one who presided over education tried to pacify the sulky loner. ?We invited him. How can we ask him to leave now??
?Either he goes out or I quit,? the old Trotskyite put his foot down.
The former Ministerial one held council with a highly disconcerted Urumaya descendant. ?You will sit with us at the head table at the next briefing. Wait on the sideline today,? he appealed to the Urumaya politico and the latter quietly moved away from the head table. ?
The media briefing began soon after and they fired salvo after salvo at the 100-day regime.

Dissolve in event of no-faith motion: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday that dissolution of Parliament was the option in the event of a no-confidence motion being mooted against him.
The Prime Minister made these remarks in response to the United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) MPs, who pressed for the debate on the no-confidence motion.
He said there were two options- to take up the motion or to dissolve Parliament. However, Mr. Wickremesinghe asked for the dissolution of Parliament immediately.
He said the UPFA MPs, agitating for the debate on the no-confidence motion, were afraid of an election in the aftermath of dissolution of Parliament.
The Prime Minister said though the government did not intended to stay any longer after the conclusion of the 100-day programme period, further time had been given for it at the request of the UPFA only.
"UPFA sought further time to enact the 20th Amendment. That is the reason for the government to stay in power further after the 100-day programme period. We did not seek ask for more time. We want to seek a fresh mandate. But, the UPFA wanted it," he said.
Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) Leader Dinesh Gunawardane said nobody in Parliament was opposed to the dissolution of Parliament.
He said the rupee value was getting depreciated against the US dollar on a daily basis causing huge economic impacts under the present government.
"We cannot allow this government to run further," he said.

Hashish worth of Rs.1.3m seized by Customs
	
The Sri Lanka Customs thwarted an attempt to smuggle a stock of hashish worth over Rs.1.3 million into the country this evening in the form of a packet of chocolates.
Customs officers at the Colombo Cargo Office in Seeduwa, on suspicion,opened and examined a package that had been sent by a Sri Lankan male in Italy addressed to a 59 year old woman in Hikkaduwa.
Customs spokesman, director Leslie Gamini said the couriered parcel had been described as containing 20 slabs of chocolate; but owing to their suspicions the Customs officers had decided to open the package in the presence of the clearing agents.
Upon examination, the officials had found a substance they believed to be hashish.
Inquiries had confirmed that it was a form of hashish and weighed around two kilograms. Hashish comes in many types and forms, and a gram of it costs around $50 or Rs. 6,500.
Last month 500 grams of hashish was seized at the same office. It had come in a couriered parcel and described as cooking chocolate.
A young female bank manager had come to clear the parcel claiming it was cooking chocolate. But the Customs officials had, on suspicion, examined it with a Field Test Kit -- which indicated that it was hashish.
The officials believe that the hashish was smuggled in to be sold to foreign tourists, as there is no major demand for it among locals.
The case initiated by the Customs Colombo Cargo officials had been taken over by the Customs Narcotics Control Unit for further investigation. The Police Narcotics Bureau had also been informed about the detection. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

He used state funds to develop his own coconut estates!
	
This Ministerial one of the previous regime from Uva bears a name with a reference to flowers. The name of the electorate he is looking after too refers to flowers.
Prior to getting Ministerial office, this politico, metaphorically speaking a stranger to flowers, struggled on thorns. Blooming fast after becoming a Ministerial one, he had turned a new chapter in his life as a landed proprietor, an owner of several coconut plantations.
The largest coconut estate he owns is located in an area north of the Wayamba Province ? within the coconut triangle.
During his hay day in politics, he had obtained state funds purportedly to rehabilitate several state-owned coconut plantations under a coconut development project. And the politico had instead used the state funds to develop his own coconut estates, they say.
State-owned coconut plantations employees who stumbled on the secret have now sent petitions to the authorities and a high-powered probe into the affair is in the offing.

Govt. to host Diaspora festival
	
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was planning to host a festival of Diaspora by the end of the year in a bid to facilitate meaningful interactions between the government and the Diaspora communities to move forward reconciliation and development efforts.
MFA Spokesperson Mahishini Colonne addressing the weekly press briefing at the Ministry premises said the Ministry was also considering the possibility of making the festival an annual event in order to harness the tremendous capacity and goodwill of the Diaspora community for the development process of the country.
She noted that some members of the Diaspora was willing to return to Sri Lanka and among them were intellectuals, professionals and experts, who could contribute to the development of various sectors in the country ? a fact that had been reiterated at the meeting held last week in London among members of various Tamil Diaspora groups, which was also attended by Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera.
Ms. Colonne pointed out this festival therefore, was organised in light of the lack of an official mediation platform for the Diaspora communities to engage with the government, although was recommended by the LLRC (lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission), that engagement with the Diaspora community was vital in ensuring long lasting peace in the country.

	Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa said the declaration of Colombo as the fastest growing destination city by the MasterCard Global Destination Cities Index for 2015 was an achievement of his government and that it was the responsibility of the present government to maintain what his government had achieved.
	Mr. Rajapaksa said after the war, his government embarked on an ambitious programme to uplift the Colombo city while prioritizing the areas such as the clearing up of waterways in and around Colombo and the proper maintenance of wetlands to prevent parts of the city going under water at the slightest rain.
	The priority was given t areas such as building of new housing estates and the clearing of slums, improving garbage collection and disposal, building new parks and walkways, restoring historic and architecturally distinctive buildings, improving city roads and pavements and constructing international quality bus shelters etc.,? he said.
	?I thank them all. They have done our nation proud. Maintaining what my government achieved, is the responsibility of the present government, ?he said.
	Full Statement
	I note with immense pride that the MasterCard Global Destination Cities Index for 2015 has declared Colombo the fastest growing destination city among the 132 leading cities covered by the Index. CNN described the cumulative annual growth rate of over 21% achieved in this regard by Colombo since 2009 as ?staggering?.
	According to MasterCard, tourism had recovered strongly after the end of the three decade long war against terrorism. Rapid economic growth and fast improvements in infrastructure are among the other reasons ascribed to the growth in tourist arrivals.
	After the war, my government embarked on an ambitious programme to uplift the city of Colombo. The priority areas were; the clearing up of waterways in and around Colombo and the proper maintenance of wetlands to prevent parts of the city going under water at the slightest rain, the building of new housing estates and the clearing of slums, improving garbage collection and disposal, building new parks and walkways, restoring historic and architecturally distinctive? buildings, improving city roads and pavements and constructing international quality bus shelters etc.
	These improvements were among the most visible achievements of my government. This has now gained formal international recognition.
	None of this would have been possible if not for the commitment and hard work of the former Secretary to the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development, the former Additional Secretary to the Ministry in charge of World Bank funded projects and the project team, the former Chairmen and staff of the UDA and the Land Reclamation Corporation, the town planners and the architects of the UDA, the Municipal Commissioners and staff of Colombo and Kotte, the environmental police, the military personnel who supervised and coordinated this effort and the Civil Defence Force personnel who participated in its implementation.

	Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today said the Mahinda Rajapaksa government that was defeated at the January 8 election had no mandate in the present Parliament and that if they were attempting to change the Prime Minister in this Parliament, it would be a betrayal of the people's mandate.
	Mr. Wickremesinghe expressed these views at a news conference held at the Parliament Complex where financial help was given to the mother of a UNP supporter, Manjula Prasad, who was killed in the UNP led protest campaign ?Janabala Meheyuma? in 2001.
	?After the Mahinda Rajapaksa government was defeated at the last Presidential Election, the mandate of the Parliament which supported the former president was also annulled. But he still thinks that it has a mandate in the present Parliament. When a mandate was given to President Maithripala Sirisena, it permitted me to set up a government and to get the support of the SLFP as well. If they wanted to change it, they need to go before the people. If they think that they can change Prime Ministers in this Parliament, it will be a betrayal of the people's mandate,? he said.
	Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said that if they had forgotten what they needed to do, including that of enacting the 20th Amendment to the Constitution, what was needed was to go for an election and settle this once and for all. He warned that the UNP, which made many sacrifices to uphold democracy in the country in the past, would not allow the UPFA to form the government they want without a mandate from the people.

President Maithripala Sirisena was attempting to protect Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe from the no- confidence motion because the United National Party (UNP) votes were procured by Mr. Wickremesinghe for the victory of the President, the National Freedom Front (NFF) charged today.
NFF politburo member Nimal Piyathissa said at a media briefing held in Battaramulla that they had acknowledged President Sirisena was compelled to protect PM Wickremesinghe since he had received a considerable support from the UNP at the January 8 presidential election.
?The President on Monday at a special Cabinet meeting had instructed the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) not to proceed with the no-confidence motion. President Sirisena could not ignore the UNP,? he said. (Piyumi Fonseka and Sanath Desmond)

US flashes red light on crude oil from Iran
	
A dispute is brewing between Sri Lanka and the US over an alleged purchase of fuel from Iran which is under a global trade embargo, Daily Mirror learns.
It is learnt that a oil tanker carrying one million barrels of crude oil worth Rs.10 billion reportedly purchased by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) from Iran is heading towards Sri Lanka.
Commenting on this cargo, the US Embassy has written to the Power and Energy Ministry Secretary B.M.S. Batagoda saying that this stock of crude oil suspected to be of Iranian origin and carried on board the tanker Mercs F WHALE should not be unloaded at the Colombo Port.
"The CPC is well aware that there is an embargo on purchasing crude oil from Iran, this cargo should not be accepted by the CPC," the US Embassy's letter in the possession of Daily Mirror states.
The US embassy said in a letter dated February 6, 2015, Sri Lanka had reaffirmed its commitment to ensure zero level imports of crude oil from Iran and that that the Ministry had advised the CPC of this undertaking and directed them to continue with the procedure to share information with the US authorities on the import of crude oil to Sri Lanka.
"Despite your instructions, it is reported that the CPC has purchased a consignment of one million barrels of Iranian crude oil," the embassy said.
"In light of close Sri Lanka-U.S. cooperation on Iran, we wish to bring to your attention Information regarding the vessel F WHALE. Based on Information available to the US Government, the Singaporean flagged VARADA LALIMA loaded Iranian origin crude oil at Kharg Island in late December. The VARADA LALIMA then conducted a ship-to-ship (STS) transfer involving the Iranian origin crude with the Liberian flagged F WHALE in early January off Khor Fakkan. Following the STS transfer, VARADA LALIMA again loaded Iranian origin crude oil at Kharg Island in Iran in January."
The embassy said the acceptance of the consignment of crude oil from Iran tantamounts to a serious violation of the undertaking given to the US by the Sri Lankan Government and is liable to damage the prevailing goodwill between the two countries.
The US embassy wants the Power and Energy Ministry advices the Sri Lanka Ports Authority to check the Flag registration of this vessel which is on its way to the Colombo Port.
Most importantly, the Sri Lanka Ports Authority may also look into the Insurance coverage, since according to The US Authorities the vessel F WHALE was dropped by the Insurer, the American Club in early January 2015 and she does not appear to have a picked up any other coverage. Hence allowing this vessel to call at Colombo Harbour or in its vicinity can cause alarm among the shipping community and will endanger the safety of harbor and shores in the vicinity.
Please inform the action being taken in this regard to re-assure US authorities of our cooperation at this crucial juncture in our relations.
Meanwhile, Director Foreign Affair for the Secretary to the Presidents, Himalee Arunatilaka, drawing the attention of a meeting she had with the Charge d?Affairs of the USA embassy in Colombo says that theUS envoy had conveyed that they have information that the Liberian flagged vessel F WHALE which is suspected of carrying Iranian oil is currently en route to Colombo and could arrive by June 4th or 5th. The vessel has failed to comply with annual safety and other requirement and is no longer registered under the Liberian or Panamanian flag. USA is concerned that it may be coming to dock in Colombo as it has failed to obtain permission to dock anywhere else. There is also concern that at least some of the Iranian origin oil may be unloaded in Sri Lanka.
The US Embassy will be making representations to the Foreign Ministry. The Liberian flagged vessel allegedly carrying Iranian oil likely to dock in Colombo. Your attention is drawn to the attached documents regarding the above, received from the Presidential Secretariat. As you are aware, Sri Lanka complies with US sanctions on Iran and accordingly has given an undertaking that Sri Lanka will not purchase Iranian oil. There is a concern at least some of the Iranian origin oil may be unloaded in Sri Lanka. Considering the US sanctions, grateful take appropriate action. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Winning one will lead to losing two!
	
The chair of the leader of the house of the western council lies vacant for the last four months and three members vying for the post constantly hang around the new big boss, they say.
However, the New Big Boss so far has not made any move to pick anyone to fill the vacancy.
Some say that the New Big Boss is deliberately delaying nominating a member for the vacant post for a very good reason. ?He fears that if any one of the three hopefuls is nominated for the post, the other two will take offence and will team up with the rebel group within the council led by the Chief Minister,? they point out.
Therefore, according to them, all indications are that the vacant chair will remain vacant until the dissolution of the Diyawanna council.
