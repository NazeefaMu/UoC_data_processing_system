Vicious circle at work
	

A certain Ministry is following a policy of denying promotions to white collar ones believed to be Blue party-sympathizers.

White collar ones eligible for promotion to the higher grade had been short-listed following an interview held at the Ministry recently and two coordinating secretaries who had gone through the list had struck off the names of a number of candidates believed to be Blue party supporters, they say.

Victims of disappearance in SL cant wait any longer for justice: AI
	
Sri Lanka will not break with its violent past until it reckons with the cruel history of enforced disappearance and delivers justice to as many as 100,000 families who have spent years waiting for it, Amnesty International (AI) said yesterday in a report.
Amnesty Internationals report, Only Justice can heal our wounds, was scheduled to be launched by the organizations Secretary General Salil Shetty at a meeting with families of the disappeared at Mannar, Sri Lanka.
There is no community in Sri Lanka that remains untouched by the trauma of enforced disappearance. Most people in the country suffer the absence of a loved one or know someone who does. They have waited years, and in some cases, decades, to learn of the fate of their relatives. Until justice is delivered to these victims, the country cannot begin to heal, let alone move towards a more promising future, said AI Secretary General Salil Shetty.
The report said the authorities have failed to investigate the cases of disappearances, identify the whereabouts or fate of the victim, or prosecute those suspected of the crimes despite international commitments to end impunity for enforced disappearance.
Sri Lanka needs to put the victims at the heart of any reconciliation process. The authorities must hear their demands and implement them. The current government has taken encouraging steps to acknowledge the need to end impunity, but it cannot leave the victims waiting any longer. They have waited too long already. If Sri Lanka wants to successfully pull away from its violent past, it must address victims demands for justice, truth, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence, Shetty said.
To move forward, the report said the Sri Lankan government should enact legislation making disappearance a crime under national law in accordance with the Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance.

Aluth Avurudu traces its origin  to Naga people
	
It is a Nekath system
New Year advances one day in 73 years
In future, it will be celebrated on April 14, 15
New Year Celebrations in Myanmar, Thailand have Sinhala  Buddhist characteristics


"Also, we know King Devanampiyatissa went on the hunting expedition on a Nekath day. These are rituals not associated with Buddhism. Even before the advent of Buddhism, people would have incorporated some Buddhist rituals into the practice like going to temples. Punya Kalaya is a concept introduced by Buddhists. Naga and Yaksha people would have introduced Nonagatha period"

With the pulse and smell of New Year or Aluth Avurdu in the air, people get nostalgic about celebrations and observation of rituals. It is noteworthy, yet to throw some light on the origin of this festival and its uniqueness with the Sinhala Buddhist culture. According to Prof. Nalin de Silva who did extensive research into the astronomical and astrological aspect of Avurudu, it is very much linked with Nekath (auspicious) system followed by people here from time immemorial. 
In a discussion with the Daily Mirror he said the sky is divided into 27 Nekaths and Sinhala people had made use of the motion of the Sun through Nekaths. He opined that the origin of Aluth Avurudu could be traced back to the days of Naga people who inhibited the island even before the advent of Buddhism. 
Naketh is a word derived from Naka.Naka is Naga people. There had been various Naga clan from Assam in India to Sri Lanka. These Naka people were navigators. When you navigate, you have to form an idea of the stars or the planets or Grahayas. These people divided the sky into 27 Nekaths. My view is that Sinhala people developed this New Year system from these Nekaths. Originally, my understanding is that the Sinhala New year dawns when the sun passes from one Nekath to another, he said. 

"My view is that Sinhala people developed this New Year system from these Nekaths. Originally, my understanding is that the Sinhala New year dawns when the sun passes from one Nekath to another"

In a mathematical calculation of planetary motion linked with New Year, he said Sankranthi or the transitional period was the time taken by the Sun to move from Pisces to Aries. This time period is 12 hours and 48 minutes. 
He said, However, according to western astronomy, Sun moves to Aries (Mesha) not on the 13 or 14 of April, but a few days after that. This discrepancy could be explained if we consider the Neketh system where the particular disc of the Celestial Sphere, in which the Grahayas move relative to Earth is divided into 27 Nekethas instead of the 12 constellations. The New Year dawns when the sun moves from the Revathi Neketha to Asvida Neketha, and the beginnings of the Asvida Nekatha and the Aries constellation do not coincide. 
The ecliptic path of the Sun relative to Earth in the Celestial Sphere intersects the Celestial Equator of the Celestial Sphere at two points. The Sun passes through these two points on the March 21 (Northwards) and September 21 (Southwards). The Western New Year is the time interval between two consecutive March 21sts. 
The axis of the Earth is inclined to the ecliptic at an angle of 23.5 degrees and further the axis precesses. Due to this precession the point at which the ecliptic intersects the Celestial Sphere goes backwards roughly about one degree in 71 years. 
The Sinhala/Hindu New Year is the time interval between two consecutive transitions from Revathi Neketha to Asvida Neketha (or from Pisces to Aries). Due to the precession of the axis of the earth this day advances relative to the western calendar roughly about one day in 72 years. In the beginning of the 20th century the dawn of the New Year has fallen on April 12 and 13. These days, it falls on the 13th and 14th of the same month. In twenty to thirty years time it will be on the 14th and the 15th. 

"In the case of Sinhala New Year, we find Punya Kalaya or Nonagatha (inauspicious period). There is no such thing observed in India. But, there is Punniya Kaalam or subavelai observed among Jaffna Tamils. Though they do not celebrate the New Year to the extent of the Sinhalese, they also have Punniya Kaalam. In India, there is a New Year on April 14. In Tamil Nadu, it is a holiday. That is not in fact the dawn of New Year. It is to celebrate the dawn of Chiththirai month. It coincides with the Sinhala New Year "


Prof. de Silva said, Actually in history, the Sinhala people celebrated the New Year on a date in the latter part of March. That was according to the old Julian calendar. It was changed with the Gregorian calendar. 
For example, the Russian revolution took place in October. According to the new calendar, it was in November, if you add that. During the time of Robert Knox, the Sinhala/Hindu New Year was celebrated somewhere around April, 7, 8 or 9. That is with the change of calendar. 
Now we have it on April 13 or 14. Once in 73 years, the New Year advanced by one day. It will dawn on April 15 in future. The Sinhala people used a different calendar altogether. The western calendar says the New Year starts on the midnight of January 1. There is no physical significance attached to this date. It is a date fixed by westerners. In respect of the Sinhala/Hindu New Year, it is fixed by the motion of the sun relative to the earth. These are all relative motions. There are no absolute motions as such. There are no absolute concepts. All concepts are relative. We are concerned with our fate on the earth, whether astrologically or not. We do all these things related to the earth. Here we observe the motion of the sun relative to the earth. Even the sun moves in the Milky Way. The Milky Way also moves within the local group of galaxies. The local group of galaxies also moves with the expansion of universe. All these measurements are relative. 

"Due to the precession of the axis of the earth this day advances relative to the western calendar roughly about one day in 72 years. In the beginning of the 20th century the dawn of the New Year has fallen on April 12 and 13. These days, it falls on the 13th and 14th of the same month. In twenty to thirty years time, it will be on the 14th and the 15th"

If you ask me the length of the Mahaweli River, I do not know. What are the two end points These two end points change with the low tide and the high tide. All you can do is to take the average. There is no absolute way of measuring these things. What is the tallest mountain in the world Somebody can say Everest. Another will say something different because the height of it is measured relative to the sea level or to the centre of the earth. If you measure it relative to the centre of the earth, then Mount Everest is not the highest. The sea level is also changes. 
Coming back to the subject, I can say, relative to the earth, the sun moves in ecliptic which is the word used in western astronomy. The path of the sun relative to the earth is not fixed. We know that the earth is inclined at an angle of 23.5. Because of this, the path of the sun intersects the celestial horizon. The point of intersection of the ecliptic with the celestial equator changes. Because of this change, the date of the dawn on the New Year advances. That is the reason. During these days, it is on April 14. Then, in the case of Sinhala New Year, we find Punya Kalaya or Nonagatha (inauspicious period). There is no such thing observed in India. But, there is Punniya Kaalam or subavelai observed among Jaffna Tamils. Though they do not celebrate the New Year to the extent of the Sinhalese, they also have Punniya Kaalam. In India, there is a New Year on April 14. In Tamil Nadu, it is a holiday. That is not in fact the dawn of New Year. It is to celebrate the dawn of Chiththirai month. It coincides with the Sinhala New Year. 
If the New year advanced by one day in every 73 year period, there should be people remembering the celebration of the event on a different date in April during their lifetime. How do you support that argument
It is good that you asked about it. In fact, I have mentioned in my writing earlier about the celebration of New Year on April 12 in a year at the beginning of the 20th century. If not for leap years coming after every four years, this would have advanced less than 73 years. 
How did Avurudu become a matter for celebration in this manner with religious rituals associated with it
Buddhist rituals have been introduced later. I feel that from Naga days, it should have been celebrated. We have this Nekath Keli. It is something to do with this. Also, we know King Devanampiyatissa went on the hunting expedition on a Nekath day. These are rituals not associated with Buddhism. Even before the advent of Buddhism, people would have incorporated some Buddhist rituals into the practice like going to temples. Punya Kalaya is a concept introduced by Buddhists. Naga and Yaksha people would have introduced Nonagatha period. During the Nonagatha, we have two aspects. During the first segment, people go to temples. 
How is it different from other countries in the region that celebrate the New Year
We have fixed physical custom here. Compared with the westerners, they have an idea  the December 31 midnight, this has something to do with. 
The Sinhala Buddhist culture would have been taken to Theravada Buddhist countries such as Myanmar, Cambodia and Thailand. That is the Sinhala Buddhist culture imposed on the Chinese culture. During the 12th century, the Sinhala Buddhist culture had been imposed. There were good relations with these countries through Theravada Buddhism. In Thailand too, they use the word Sankranthi. 

"In respect of the Sinhala/Hindu New Year, it is fixed by the motion of the sun relative to the earth. These are all relative motions. There are no absolute motions as such. There are no absolute concepts. All concepts are relative. We are concerned with our fate on the earth, whether astrologically or not"

Buses without route permits: Fine increased to Rs. 200,000
	
Parliament today gave approval to the National Transport Commission (Amendment) Bill which proposed to increase the fine on inter-provincial buses plying without valid route permits from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 200,000.
Transport Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva told parliament that several complaints had been received by the National Transport Commission (NTC) from passengers and bus associations that some inter-provincial buses were plying without valid route permits specially those coming to the South from the North.
He said this practice was an injustice to the bus operators who were operating by respecting the rules and regulations and added that it also posed a threat to the security of the passengers.
The Minister said the new Bill to amend the fines were brought in following a thorough discussion with the relevant parties and that it had been approved by the Attorney Generals Department as well.
He said they expected the assistance from the police to apprehend the bus operators who violated the law.
The Minister revealed that the NTC had issued 3219 route permits so far which include 2054 normal route permits, 454 semi-luxury permits, 603 luxury permits and 94 super luxury permits.
He said there was a surplus in buses in certain routes after the decision taken to issue them through a tender procedure.
The Minister said the increase in the fines would help to reduce the incidents of illegal activities involving route permits. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

CEB strike starts Wed. midnight
	
A 24-hour-strike would be launched from Wednesday, April 5 midnight by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) Joint Trade Unions Alliance against the alleged oppression of trade unions and to urge the Government to rectify CEB employees salary anomalies.
We are looking at a massive strike, which involves drivers, storekeepers and all the employees. In a case of a breakdown, no employee will be available to repair them, till Friday morning, Ceylon Electricity Employees Union Secretary Ranjan Jayalal told the Daily Mirror.
He said all of the CEBs work would be hindered on Thursday at all its plants. Bill payment, maintenance, tender calling are some of the other procedures which will be affected, he said.
He said the main objective of the strike was to rectify the current salary anomaly within the CEB.
The standard salary difference between the management level and lower level employees should be 4:1. Any salary increase should be made based on this rate. However, it was changed to 5:1 in 2012. Then Government agreed to rectify this by increasing salaries of all employees by 30 percent in 2014, he said.
He said at present, management level employees enjoy a salary hike between 70-120 percent while other employees salary had only been increased by 30 percent following two discreet gazettes issued on last presidential Election Day.
CEB top management officials salaries were increased during the last Presidential Election so the politicians could distribute light posts and other CEB properties during the election.
When we raised the issue, they agreed to increase the salaries of all employees, but on the Election Day, two different Gazette notices were issued, he said.
He said they had had discussions with Ministers Champika Ranawaka and Ranjith Siyambalapitiya but to no avail. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

The clean-up operation is underway in towns in northern New South Wales and Queensland that were ravaged by Cyclone Debbie and the devastating floods that followed. 
Residents who abandoned their homes in flood-hit towns like Murwillumbah and Lismore have returned to find their houses in a state of ruin. Pictures show banana trees and cars among the debris washed up in peoples front gardens, with some vehicles written off after flipping over during the tumultuous weather.

Colombian river avalanche death toll hits 250
	

The search for hundreds of missing people has resumed after flooding and mudslides in Colombia sent torrents of water and debris crashing on to houses in the early hours of Saturday - killing more than 250 people. 
The army said in a statement last night that 254 people were killed, 400 people had been injured and 200 were missing as the countrys President Juan Manuel Santos declared a state of emergency. Days of heavy rain caused the Japura river, a tributary of the Amazon, to overflow and the avalanche of water swept through Mocoa, near the border with Ecuador.The search for the missing resumed at dawn this morning after it was suspended last night due to a lack of power and drinking water. 
Rescuers pried through piles of rocks and wooden planks that entombed homes while streets could be seen covered in thick sand, mud, branches of trees from the rivers and rainforest that surround the city. The exact death toll is difficult to confirm as the rescue mission continues with some estimates claiming as many as 300 people have died.

Prakash Schaffter addresses Asia Insurance Reviews regional conference
	
Veteran Sri Lankan Insurer and Managing Director of Janashakthi Insurance PLC, Prakash Schaffter was invited to share his learning from the Sri Lankan Insurance sectors shift to the Risk-Based Capital (RBC) framework, at the 3rd Asia Conference on Risk-Based Capital in Manila, Philippines recently.
The two-day conference was organised by the Asia Insurance Review, one of the regions most respected publications in the Insurance sector, under the theme of Getting ready and strategic about RBC.
Featuring a stellar speaker panel of over 20 senior Insurance sector representatives from across the region, the event was well attended by CEOs, CFOs and CROs of Insurance companies as well as senior regulators. The strategic conference was organised with the aim of helping companies better comprehend the power of RBC and prepare for the new regime while learning from the experiences of those markets already using RBC.
Globally, the Insurance sector has been witnessing a steady shift from solvency based frameworks to risk-based capital frameworks. In an RBC regime, the capital to be held by an Insurer is determined based on an assessment of risks that the company should hold to protect customers against adverse developments. Seeing the merits of this system, both for Insurers and the insured, even more regulators are working towards adopting it, said Prakash Schaffter.
Schaffter noted that he personally believed that basing capital requirement on the risk profile of an organisation was a more realistic approach to valuing a companys assets and liabilities (i.e. financial position/strength of a company), making it consistent for all players in a market.
Speaking about Sri Lankas journey towards adopting RBC, he added, The Insurance Board of Sri Lanka, our national regulator, made the initial proposal to move to a RBC platform in 2008. However, we are privileged that they did not rush to roll this out in haste. The industry worked together on drafting the framework and fine tuning it till there was an optimal system and I am delighted to note that, with the guidance of our regulator and the collaboration of all stakeholders, we have successfully migrated to this framework, with RBC having been made mandatory from the beginning of 2016. Elaborating on the industrys learnings from the transformation, Schaffter stated that the decision to road test the system had proved to be very useful, whilst noting that companies need to have strong actuarial competencies to make prudent assessments of the companys risk profile. He further stressed on the need to educate senior management and board members and also the importance of providing them with the right tools to help better understand the impact of RBC on their day-to-day business decisions.

Professor Valentine Joseph: A beautiful mind and the humblest of human beings
	
This is a heartfelt tribute to the late Professor Valentine Joseph, the former Professor of Mathematics, Colombo University.
I write this as a student who once sat in his classroom with eyes filled with wonder and awe, and whose thinking was forever changed by this wonderful human being. This is a tribute to a top scholar, teacher and a human being, one so exceptional that the heavens will surely give a standing ovation to honour his life on earth. I, Professor Josephs former student, am also a mathematician, and as such, every word that I speak of him will be as precise and truthful as the math he taught me. In that spirit, he is the single most beautiful mind that I have ever met in my lifetime, and I am sure multitudes of his students who learned from him over several decades will definitely agree with me in unison.
In order to earn such a tribute from several generations of students, a teacher must have extraordinary characteristics and achievements in three areas: as a teacher, as a scholar and finally as a human being. I cannot think of a single human being that I have met during my life as a student who possessed all three of these attributes to the extent of Professor Joseph. While my heart aches with his passing, my mind is filled with gratitude for the privilege to have associated with him even for a few years of my life.


I did not have to come to the doors of Colombo University to know about Professor Joseph as I actually knew him from school days. As a young boy, I racked my brains over the wonderfully-intrinsic problems that showered the Applied Mathematics exams in the seventies. I often asked the question: Who would be creative enough to craft such beautiful problems I never saw such challenging, yet beautiful problems in any one of the British math textbooks which we followed. One day, one of my teachers who himself was a student of Professor Joseph, told me that a professor named Valentine Joseph, a lecture at the Colombo University, was the creator of these problems. Even more, he told me that Professor Joseph was actually better known for his expertise in the special theory of relativity. After a brief explanation of relativity, I knew instantly that someday I must meet this scholar and learn from him. I know for a fact that the desire to meet him and learn from him played a big part in me arriving at the doors of Colombo University a couple of years later. I can still feel the anticipation I had one warm afternoon as I waited for him to present the first lecture to a packed Physics Lecture Theatre.


His first lecture got us all by surprise. Naturally, we all waited for a lecture filled with equations and theorems but what he really did was open a door. He turned the key and let us in to a brand new universe filled with beauty and flux. He guided us slowly through that universe and we started seeing how equations and theorems formed its fabric and he told stories we had never heard of. When teaching Einsteins special theory of relativity, of which he was an absolute expert, he taught his students to question everything, the very foundations of the known universe. He opened our minds to new dimensions in which he played the role of a patient and yet kind guide to students who, in turn, simply enjoyed the journey and bowed in sheer respect.
The mathematics journey that he started with us reached its climax in the final year of the Mathematics Special Degree when he explored the beauties of the Minkowski Spacetime which is closely associated with the special theory of relativity. We watched in sheer wonder as he manipulated and connected so many different branches of mathematics together like a child who creates a beautiful picture out of a box of scattered jigsaw pieces.


Today, most of the students who were privileged enough to learn from him are top professionals scattered world over. Almost every Sri Lankan university will have academics who learned the first steps of relativity from this erudite scholar. In North America, almost every state or province today has a mathematics teacher who learned from Professor Joseph. We will all transfer at least a glimpse of the knowledge he gave us to students, thereby immortalizing the legacy of Professor Joseph.
I was, in a way, luckier than most students as I had the privilege to associate with him closely when I returned to the Colombo University as an academic in 1994. I will never forget some of the quotes he told me. He once mentioned the Buddhist saying, Build a raft to simply cross the river. Never carry it with you after you cross the river. During a science club talk, he once said, Dont run with the pack of wolves; see the reality under your nose. In a lighter vein, once he immersed an entire audience in laughter by whispering, He has the greatest unsolved problem of all, when I, as a bachelor, was giving a talk on unsolved problems in mathematics. The reader would be surprised to hear how he very recently connected some phrases from a famous comic strip Calvin and Hobbes to mathematics as he was talking to a visitor who brought him some Calvin books.
He brought so much humour into his class, but always in pure innocent fun, and in my life I have never seen him attack anyone verbally for any reason or speak ill of anyone. This is, as unbelievable as it may sound, simply the truth. Professor Joseph was the humblest of human beings. I still remember the day when wrote Retired Teacher as his profession in the attendance list as he quietly and from a back seat attended a talk of one of his students, and then vanished before we could catch up with him. In the mid-nineties, I had the honour of playing a primary role in his farewell. He simply refused any retirement gift but instead agreed to a painting. A painting of him No, it was a painting of a tiny Earth bathed in a sea of planets. A label coming out of planet Earth simply said, Albert Einstein Lived Here. Since then, whenever I visit the Colombo University, and have a chance to come near the Physics Lecture Theatre, I can just see the banner: Professor Valentine Joseph Taught Here.
He was simply a legend and the most beautiful mind I have met in my life. I am sure his entire student body will join me in wishing heavenly peace for this wonderful human being, scholar and teacher. May his soul rest in peace.

Recalling  war  trauma
	





Dusty lanes and fences covered with fertilizer bags at houses in line at Gummidipoondi camp.

In June 1990, eleven boats carrying around 500 Sri Lankan Tamils arrived in Danushkodi, Tamil Nadu, India. Four pregnant women and dozens of kids who were tethered to their mothers for safety were among those in the boats. Most were barefoot. They had no life jackets. With only the clothes they were wearing, they were stranded at sea with no food, water or hopes for the future. They were forced to experience unbelievable hardships as they fled their homeland due to the armed conflict between Sri Lankan forces and the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam). Indian fishermen charged Rs.5,000 from each Sri Lankan for the boat service. The desperate victims sold all their possessions to make the payments. 

After three days on the sea, they were found by the Indian coastguard officials who thoroughly examined them and sent them to Mandapam, the largest Sri Lankan refugee camp in the Tamil Nadu state. This was only one group of Sri Lankans who fled the country during the war.
According to reports, the exodus of Sri Lankan Tamils in the Northern and Eastern provinces started from the beginning of Black July in 1983. Between 1983 and 1987, at least 134,000 Sri Lankan Tamils were officially estimated to have arrived in Tamil Nadu. When the war intensified in June 1990, the next round of Tamils arrived in India. The third round was reported to have arrived in 1995. 

Reports of the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) said that during the final phase of the war, there was a massive displacement of the population in the North, with some 276,000 displaced. UNHCRs most recent statistics show that at the end of 2010, there were some 140,000 Sri Lankan refugees with a majority of 70,000 in 112 refugee camps and another 32,000 living outside camps in Tamil Nadu. Currently, the Commissionerate of Rehabilitation and Welfare of Non-Resident Tamils of Tamil Nadu is monitoring about 19,451 Sri Lankan Tamil families consisting of about 63,351 Sri Lankan Tamil refugees accommodated in 108 camps in 24 districts in the state. The camp in Gummidipoondi, situated 46.6 km away from the capital Chennai, is a shelter for close to 1000 families. 

Daily Mirror visited Sri Lankan Tamils in the Gummidipoondi refugee camp. They were delighted to see a Sri Lankan visiting the camp. Some of them have almost forgotten Sinhala, as the language was hardly used by them in the past 27 years. Still, they spoke quite well in Sinhala.

	We lived in Anuradhapura. The war started and we moved to Kilinochchi. Years later, planes started bombing Kilinochchi
	

	Even though visible wounds can be healed, invisible wounds from the war are so devastating that they are harder to repair
	

	Innocent lives were also lost while they attempted to make their way to India by sea
	
Invisible wounds from war harder to repair: Arulanandam

Fleeing for their lives, Arulanandam and his wife Victoria who lived in Anuradhapura, moved to Kilinochchi in the 1980s during the start of the war. After the fighting and bombing reached Kilinochchi in the 1990s, they decided to leave everything behind and flee to the nearest country. Now in his fifties and a father of three, Arulanandam recalled his memories of the war which turned their lives upside down. 
We lived in Anuradhapura. The war started and we moved to Kilinochchi. Years later, planes started bombing Kilinochchi. We lived in fear. We could not stay there anymore. Fear drove us to realise that there was no other option than to leave the country. We decided to go to Tamil Nadu, he said. 
Arulanandam broke down in tears when he remembered his brothers five-year-old son who died in an aerial bombing in front of their eyes in Kilinochchi. 
He said that even though visible wounds could be healed, invisible wounds from the war were so devastating that they were harder to repair. 
In their desperation to escape the unbearable conditions, they embarked on a route. Innocent lives were also lost while they attempted to make their way to India by sea. 

We lived in a constant state offear and insecurity: Nandini

	In each family, at least one member was killed
	

	We were optimistic that it would be a new beginning
	

Forty-nine-year-old Nandini tried not to sob as she looked at her granddaughter, Sarah. Sarah, who had just celebrated her fourth birthday last month, was unaware of the problems the adults had faced and were still facing. She was busy with her double ruled exercise book, trying hard to write a letter. 
One night I heard gunshots. Soldiers were already in front of my house. I took my son and ran. That was the day my cousin sister died in a shell attack in Kilinochchi. In each family, at least one relative was killed or injured in the war. We left Sri Lanka for the future of these kids. We sold everything we had to collect 5000 for each. We were optimistic that it would be a new beginning for all of us. Life here is nothing like I expected, Nandini said. 
She said they had to go through multiple and prolonged displacements, deprivations and were living in a constant state of fear and insecurity. 

We lived happily with Sinhala people before the war: Simona

	Before the war started, we were living happily and peacefully with Sinhala people
	
We found a 70-year-old mother of five, Simona, who is now spending the rest of her life in the Gummidipoondi camp with her eldest sons family. What made Simonas story different from other stories was that her third son was a former LTTE cadre. He had died at the age of 22 in the war. 
Simona said her husband had also died in a shell attack carried out by the Sri Lankan Army. 
Before the war started, we were living happily and peacefully with Sinhala people. We had a beautiful life in Sri Lanka before the war. I lost my son and my husband. It was easier to run from our land of birth than to see my other children die, she said.  Refugees in Gummidipoondi camp said their quest for a better future for their kids was not as fruitful as they had expected.

My brothers were captured by the Army, they never came back: Nimala

	Uncertain of her life until they reached the Danushkodhi shore
	

	My twin brothers nevercame back
	

Nimala said two youths who were in a boat had drowned in the sea after losing balance. Surrounded by the chaotic situation in the boats, attempts to save the youths were limited. Nimala said she was uncertain of her life until they reached the Danushkodhi shore. 
She looked terrified when she explained how she lost her twin brothers. 
When we were preparing to leave by boat from Talaimannar, the Sri Lankan Army stopped us and suddenly captured my twin brothers aged 23. Sundaran and Sekar were captured, on the allegation they had connections with the LTTE. The soldiers said they would release them after questioning. But my twin brothers never came back, Nimala said, with tears rolling down her cheeks. 
It was not just Sundaran and Sekar, but many youth never came back after the armed forces nabbed them on alleged LTTE connections. 

I didnt care whereI went, I just wanted to save my life: Mathews

	The bombing started. Every time we saw a plane, we thought it was a military plane that would drop shells. We could not even come out of our houses
	

	We didnt care where we went, we just wanted to save our lives
	
Mathews (46) was another Sri Lankan among the 1990 exodus. Recalling his traumatising past about the war, he said that if he had not taken the decision to get into boats on that decisive day, he would have been killed. 
The bombing started. Every time we saw a plane, we thought it was a military plane that would drop shells. We could not even come out of our houses. We were suffering in hunger and poverty. I thought if we stayed in the country, we would be killed. So we decided to leave by boat. We didnt care where we went, we just wanted to save our lives, Mathews said. 

I was 5 months pregnant whenI left Mannar : Jothika

	I gave them my gold earrings as payment and came to Tamil Nadu
	

	We did not have travel documents or anything. We left Mannar in a hurry to save ourselves from shell attacks and aerial bombardments
	
Jothika was five months pregnant when she left Mannar. 
When we heard the bomb blasts, we all started running out. I went and hid. Others helped me to travel to the place where boats were waiting for people like us. I gave them my gold earrings as payment and came to Tamil Nadu, she said. 
Choking with emotion, Jothika said she had left her motherland because she wanted to survive and provide a safe future for her unborn child. She still has no idea what happened to her husband at the time she left Mannar, as he was away. 
We did not have travel documents or anything. We left Mannar in a hurry to save ourselves from shell attacks and aerial bombardments, she said.

In this first part of their stories, we focused on their traumatising memories of the war. The next part will discuss their lives in the camps and the difficulties they face in their day-to-day lives.

## Title: Responding  to the global challenge of an ageing  population

Responding  to the global challenge of an ageing  population
	
Three medical professionals from the geriatric fraternity in Western medicine presented papers at the seminar themed Responding to the Global Challenge of an Ageing Population  an international perspective, held at the BMICH recently. Sponsored by the Gamani Corea Foundation, the seminar was headed byDr. Mahendra Gonsalkorale, retired consultant in geriatric medicine and Clinical Director for Elderly Care, Hope Hospital, Salford Royal Hospitals NHS Trust, Salford, Manchester and former Associate Lecturer in Geriatric Medicine, University of Manchester, UK.
When one of them said, some consultants here are in the habit of scoffing at elderly patients who seek their advice, saying, a case of old age, natural phenomenon and no cure; next time you hear this, tell them to treat you instead of such contemptuous rudeness, reminding me of an instance where a leading Ophthalmologist mocked and ridiculed a former Octogenarian on the basis of his age. He even used a quotation from the Guttila Kavya, the 15th century satire, to support his mockery. He had no respect for the emotional life of the elderly. The story was published in the media. I quote [in the words of the victim] from the Island newspaper of August 1, 2013.

Recently I saw a leading Ophthalmologist to seek a cure for my dwindling eyesight. The Specialist examined my eyes and declared, mata mahalu wayase beriya veena gaayanaa perase and his assistants giggled in response. Despite my discomfiture about that reaction, I explained that I was spending about four or five hours at the computer every day and the Specialist replied that the state of my optical nerves showed that such performance was unbelievable. No remedy was recommended and to my request for enhancing my reading vision, I was asked to see an optician. As I left, the Specialist was repeating the Guttila lines, creating another ripple of chuckles, much to my embarrassment. The question, If so, of what use is your medicine was uppermost in my mind but I did not give expression to it out of courtesy. [unquote]

This anonymous Ophthalmologist who is blind to medical ethics [leading in making money], is certainly not learned in manners. He has tarnished the image of the noble profession and set a bad example to his assistants. A sense of lethargy and alienation is generally associated with old age. Loss of loved ones and friends of the same age; loss of status and of a role adversely affect the elderly. Six centuries after Ven. Wettewe Thera created Guttila Kavya which carriedthe above lyrical piece, it became a popular text in school literature classes. Guttila, the ageing maestro, becomes pessimistic having to compete [by a royal decree] with Musila, his own pupil from a different territory, who challenged the teacher after learning the intricacies of playing the violin [veena] from him. The story, a Jataka fable, portrays Guttila as the veteran palace musician who withdraws to a forest abode away from the harsh world to avoid competition.
Hippocratic oath and GMC guidelines
A senior consultant approached by the writer said dignity and respect for patients were considered by the GMC to be of great importance and a whole section was devoted to it in its handbook. The few Musilas[not to be confused with the Sinhala term Moosala]of local medical profession should be reported to the GMC-UK that is responsible for regulating all stages of medical education as well as maintaining intimate contact with the royal colleges regarding the good standing of consultants (specialists); and deal firmly and fairly with doctors whose fitness to practise is in question.
The moral test of government is how it treats the elderly; those who are in the shadows of life; the sick, the needy and the handicapped.- Hubert H. Humphrey -

"Some consultants here are in the habit of scoffing at elderly patients who seek their advice, saying, a case of old age, natural phenomenon and no cure; next time you hear this, tell them to treat you instead of such contemptuous rudeness"
According to the three panellists at the seminar, the next most important point to get across is the change in the age structure of the population. In other words, the number of people in various age bands at (any) one period. The most dramatic change is the absolute increase in the number of old people at any time compared to previous years. The relative number of employed youth will decrease, mainly due to increased life expectancy and reduced fertility rates. Low fertility and extended life expectancy are likely to continue, with potentially severe economic implications due to fast-rising pension, health and social care costs. These changes will affect both the state and private sectors.
They say, Sri Lanka is one of the fastest-ageing countries in the world, with a significant proportion of the population aged 60 years or older projected to jump from 12.5% to 16.7% in 2021. Even though such demographic transition affects many countries, the speed of change is particularly dramatic for Sri Lanka.
The next important point is that within this rise in the old, there are spectacular increases in numbers surviving to extreme old age (i.e. 80 years and above). According to projections, this age group will treble, growing from 126.5 million to 444.6 million from 2015 to 2050.
Coming back to the Guttila-Musila duel, though highly-talented, Guttila suffered from psycho-social issues faced by the elderly. Musilas first encounter was with visiting businessmen from Baranasiwho were well acquainted with maestro Guttilas performance;as the author puts it in poetic sarcasm Unimu vena sadatheiNodattemu gayana karathei, how they had responded to Musilas inquiry on their impassiveness [they presumed he was only tuning it]
Myths painting a negative image
Dr. Gonsalkorale believes we have a lot of old people because good doctors keep them alive. His research has revealed that doctors have improved life expectancy by reducing deaths, mainly of the youth.
Dementia awaits us all. We will all get demented if we live long enough. Age associated illness does increase and Alzheimers disease is one such example but not all old people will develop Alzheimers although a high proportion of them would develop Dementia in various forms. They are more likely to have medical problems, he said.
Old age
Dr. Gonsalkorale said they have more disabilities. They need support for independent living. They are more likely to be retired and dependent on pensions. Greater need for adaptive transport, recreational facilities, adaptive housing produces, financial demand on the state. 
Services
Acute medical care, stroke and orthogeriatric services, older persons assessment units and rehabilitation (hospital based), general surgical and psycho-geriatric liaison and specialist clinics.
TIA clinics, Parkinsons, Rapid access clinics (TREAT), cognitive impairment clinics, community services, frailty hubs, day hospitals, care home outreach services and the Proactive Elderly Care Team (PECT). 
Solutions
Accept the reality - we will have a large elderly population with correspondingly high costs of care. Do everything possible to maintain their health with sound preventive policies. Make them as productive as possible by finding roles for them in society which are mutually beneficial.
Responsibilities 
Dr. Gonsalkorale recommends the following;
Eyesight - cataracts, spectacles, hearing aids. Better sign-posting - large print leaflets. Improved sanitary facilities - more toilets in the right places. Easier access for walking frames - wheelchairs. Education of younger people on needs of the elderly. More tolerance and understanding (for instance, recognizing sluggishness in thought, memory, digesting new information in a humane way). If the older person has mental and/or physical problems that need institutional care, they are at greater risk and the state must have policies in place -- quite apart from meeting basic healthcare needs. Sufficient care for elders to remain at home, sheltered care, residential homes, nursing homes and hospices elderly attuned hospital care. Comprehensive Geriatric Assessments (CGA), efficient geriatric units and multi-disciplinary teams.
Funding
The team suggests accountable, audited and monitored funding. Best use of money available. Response and discharge teams. Rapid assessments  community and hospital.
The ageing population will certainly challenge public and private budgets in many ways, but through a combination of reduced consumption, postponed retirement, increased asset holdings and greater investment in human capital, it should be possible to meet this challenge without catastrophic consequences --Ronald Lee, Professor of Demography and Economics at the University of California, Berkeley and Chair of the Centre on the Economics and Demography of Ageing.
When Musila visited Baranasi, there remained only Guttilas blind mother and father who asked him to wait until their son returned. Seeing the masters veena, he tries to play. The blind parents [not so blind as our Ophthalmologist] who assumed rats were nibbling the strings, spelled out the lines written by a poet of the 15th century  Su, soo yayi atha gesu sekayen.

Smart IDs coming by end of June
	
The Department of Registration of Persons has taken steps to issue smart Identity Cards by the end of June replacing the ordinary identity card, as a prelude to the issuance of Electronic Identity Cards, Registration of Persons Department Commissioner General P. Viyani Gunathilake said yesterday.
He said the old laminated Identity Cards which were used since 1972 would be replaced with the smart IDs.
The NICs used today have been changed at several occasions according to the requirements and special needs of the country, Mr. Gunathilake.
Therefore, the department is planning to collect personal data of persons as a family unit and establish a national registry and a central database with bio data of all persons above 15 years, their biometrics and photographs obtained according to International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards, he said.
Mr. Gunathilake said, obtaining biometrics and photographs of persons would be completed by the end of June.
As the second stage, the department is hoping to register each and every individual in the country in the database register.
For that the department is seeking the relevant legal authentications and later as the third step the Electronic National Identity card would be issued, he said.
The new Electronic ID, comprising security features against tampering, counterfeiting and forgery, will include the person's photograph, bio data, fingerprints and also the blood group. It will also conform to relevant international standards, such as those set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Tips to save electricity at home
	
By Kamanthi Wickramasinghe
Saving electricity has become a challenge with warmer climates prevailing all year round. In Sri Lanka it is quite difficult to survive without a fan or A/C in most houses and office blocks. In Colombo and other suburban areas, every house is equipped with a fan as it is one big concrete jungle. But it is always advisable to cut down costs and lower your electricity bills. Here are a few tips on how you could possibly save electricity:
Switch to CFL bulbs: Replacing incandescent bulbs with compact fluorescent lightbulbs (CFLs) is one of the quickest, easiest ways to save moneyand a place everyone can start. CFLs use about 75 percent less energy and last up to 10 times longer than incandescent bulbs.
Use natural light: As Sri Lanka is a sunny country, you could use natural light to brighten up the interiors of your house during the day.
Take shorter showers: Using hot water is expensive and if you are a resident of the Hill country, you are likely to use hot water to shower during the cold season.
Turn water off when washing hands or brushing teeth: We sometimes forget to turn off the tap while applying soap on our hands or when brushing our teeth. Although this would be convenient for you, it is slowly tapping on your bill.
Unplug unused electronics: Standby power can account for 10% of an average household's annual electricity use.
Install window coverings: Promote airflow through your home and block the afternoon sun. Therefore you do not have to use the fan or A/C unless its very warm.
Reduce heat in the kitchen: Avoid using the oven and other appliances unless absolutely necessary. Try making salads and smoothies rather than having to depend on electrical appliances.
Run full loads of laundry: Rather than washing your clothes every day, trying doing your washing once a week. In Sri Lanka women in rural areas have the privilege of doing their laundry in the nearest lake or river, thereby cutting down the cost of a washing machine.
Hang dry your laundry: This is a common practice in Sri Lanka and many housewives rely on the sun to dry their clothes. But on rainy days they would have to seek alternative methods.
Be efficient with refrigeration: Keep your fridge and freezer at their ideal temperature.
Saving electricity is one way of saving energy in the long run. In Sri Lanka there are various projects being implemented to cut down the cost of electricity and carry out sustainable methods of energy conservation such as electric power. United Tractors is one source where you would have access to a fully integrated approach to electric power in Sri Lanka. Many of the biggest buildings and industrial facilities in the country are powered by Cat generators. The most power dependent institutions such as hospitals and 5 star hotels too rely on Cat power.

Unbelievable, but true
	

Antics of sons of certain purohitas in the past who led an extravagant lifestyle at public expense while throwing their weight about like ordinary thugs are well known to the people in this country. The behavior of the sons of certain present purohitas too is more or less the same if not worse as those of their past counterparts in their hay day. Given this background, one might be amazed to hear that there is a son of a powerful purohita in yahapalanaya who goes about in a three-wheeler.

This youngster attends his school in the city either by a hired three wheeler or by bus from his residence located close to a well-known hall as his father has strictly forbidden the use of any official vehicle for private transport by his family members.
The purohita has not allowed his son and the other members of the family to enjoy any perk he himself is entitled to either.
