Sea Marshal Officers' Association today urged the Defence Ministry to take over the sea marshals? service from Avant Garde Maritime Service (Pvt) Limited (AGMSL) and allow the sea marshals to carry out their duties independently and professionally.
Sea Marshal Officers' Association Convener B.I. Abdeen said with the AGMSL handling the country?s sea marshals? service, nearly $1700 had been cut from each sea marshal?s salary.
?When we were serving under the supervision of the Defence Ministry we used to earn $2800 monthly from international shipping lines for our risky and responsible job. Nevertheless, after our service was taken by Avant Garde our monthly salary has reduced to $900. The AGMSL did not even ensure our safety,? Mr. Abdeen said.
He told the media that they had sent several letters to President Maithripala Sirisena, State Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardene and Defence Secreatary Karunasena Hettiarachchi on this matter but it had been in vain.
Mr. Abdeen said AGMSL Chairman Nissanka Senadhipath had warned them not to reveal any details about their salary issue to anyone and in case they had done so they would be sacked from the service. (Piyumi Fonseka)Video by Buddhi

Murdered SL maid: Blood money or punishment?
	
The Kuwaiti government might pay ?blood money? on behalf of Sri Lankan housemaid Jayawathi Ilangasinghe (50) who was murdered recently in Kuwait or the maximum punishment will be imposed on those convicted, Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala speculated yesterday.
The woman--a mother of two was found dead with stab injuries at the house in which she was employed in. According to Kuwait media reports, her employer?s son had allegedly murdered her and fled the area.
However, the Kuwait police had arrested two sons of the employer including the son who had escaped in connection with the murder.
Speaking at a media briefing held yesterday at the Foreign Employment Bureau, Minister Athukorala said she had been informed that the two sons of the employer had pleaded guilty for the murder.
She said if the victim?s family members are willing to get ?blood money? as compensation by initiating the pardon process for the convicted, it can be done. Otherwise, once the court proceedings are completed, a maximum punishment to the convicted will be imposed.
The Kuwaiti judicial system is based on the Egyptian model, being a mixture of Islamic Sharia law.
Kuwaiti law also follows the practice of reducing sentences for murder offences in return for blood money compensation paid to a murder victim?s family, and this is an important part of the clemency process. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Real inclusiveness should come from the people: Power
	
	The fear that granting certain liberties would come at the expense of security is a concern that is reasonable and understandable and one that not only prevails in Sri Lanka but also in the US, Permanent Representative of the US to the UN, Ambassador Samantha Power said today.
	Ambassador Power who is currently on a three-day official visit to Sri Lanka, made these remarks while speaking to a group of local university students and Sri Lankan youth at a discussion held at the JDA Galley last afternoon.
	She said while change is unmistakably underway, voices that appeal to certain fears might still linger.
	?The fear that is we dig too deep to a painful past, the pursuit of a bright future might be lost; the fear that certain liberties come at the expense of security are perfectly understandable and reasonable,? she said.
	Ambassador Power noted that Sri Lanka is not the only country susceptible to such fears and that similar destructive invocations have materialised even in the US following the recent terror attack in Paris.
	She pointed to the calls that are being made in the US to turn away refugees who have suffered bombings, disappearances and religious persecution, to apply a religious test for refugees and to have entire populations under surveillance simply based on their religious backgrounds and described them as ?outrageous . . . offensive acts that smear the legacy of the US ? the proud tradition of taking in people who have undergone immense suffering?.
	?Such fears may not be easily unlearned but we cannot allow ourselves to be governed by them. That is how we would be able to prevent the repetition of the cycle of mistrust and strife . . .,? she added.
	Citing UN diplomat S?rgio Vieira de Mello, Ambassador Power said ?fear is a bad advisor? and highlighted the importance of not allowing fears to govern our thoughts and actions.
	In her speech, she called on the leaders, communities and individuals to make a conscious decision to not be governed or compromised by such fears. Getting to know such persons who have been marginalised or misunderstood, she said would help people realise that they are not different and create the necessary basic empathy, which would be the thread that would tie the communities together.
	Furthermore, Ambassador Power commented on the ongoing debate on Sri Lanka and the creation of a climate of inclusiveness. She said while the Sri Lankan government has a crucial role to play in making the society more inclusive, the real inclusiveness should come from among the common people.
	?A simple act that would show that we understand them; that their kids are just like ours... When we get to know one another, we would be less likely to succumb to those fears. We would treat them as we ourselves would like to be treated and this golden rule is in every religion including Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam,? she added.
	An ardent women?s rights activist, she also spoke on the importance of women?s participation in politics and positions of leadership.
	She noted that having women in positions of leadership is not only intrinsically valuable but also critically important to the future of a country and pointed that studies have shown that increased female participation and leadership and politics has made states more stable and prosperous.
	?Its baffling however that in Sri Lanka, a country that marked several milestones in the history of women?s political participation decades ago, had only 550 female contestants at the recent elections as opposed to 5600 males,? she said while appealing to women to take up more opportunities in politics and leadership as it would benefit their communities more.
	Speaking further Ambassador Power said that she is impressed by the participation of civil society in the current brainstorming that is ongoing concerning the make-up of the accountability mechanism. She also commended the positive changes that have occurred in the country since January 2015.
	?What is happening in Sri Lanka is inspiring. I can?t think of any other country in the world where there has been this much change in such a short period. . .People want to know what?s going on in Sri Lanka and we want to be by your side as you undertake what might on some days seem like a monumental challenge,? she added.

Budget has broken PM?s election pledge: Gammanpila
	
The government?s decision to increase prices of vehicles through the budget-2016 has blatantly violated Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe?s election promise to provide one vehicle for each middle class family, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila charged today.
He said some vehicle prices would be increased by Rs. 400,000 while some would be increased by Rs. 7 million.
?The Prime Minister in his election manifesto, pledged to make provisions to provide at least one vehicle for each middle class family. However, through the budget, the government had today increased the prices of vehicles by hundred thousands of rupees. The election promise given previously has become another broken promise,? Mr. Gammanpila told a news conference.
He said the argument of the government to increase vehicle prices was the increasing city traffic and limited road capacity. ?Didn?t they know these facts when giving promises to the people during the election campaign?? he asked.
He said the previous government of President Mahinda Rajapaksa had not even touched the prices of environment friendly vehicles such as electric vehicles but the present government had not even spared the prices of those vehicles.?
?
?We will call for a black flag day against this injustice towards the people. We request people to tie a black flag to their vehicles in protest over this unreasonable vehicle price increase,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

The objective of the visit of US permanent representative to the UN, Samantha Power to Sri Lanka is to promote federalism, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila claimed today.
He said the UN?s Political Affairs Department has launched a programme to encourage third world countries which are caught up in ethnic conflicts to introduce a federal administration.
?This programme was launched in 2012 on a proposal by Ms. Power. Sri Lanka is the programme?s next target and she is here to make sure it happens. The US was successful in introducing federalism to Iraq and Nepal,? Mr. Gammanpila told a news conference. ?
He said at a news conference on her arrival, Ms. Power had commended the measures being taken to abolish the executive presidency. ?
Mr. Gammanpila said abolishing executive presidency would weaken the country.
?The US administration is based on an executive presidential system since 1789. There are no dissenting views against its executive presidency because it wants to continue accumulating more power. The US is well aware that before introducing federalism it is necessary to weaken the country by weakening the executive presidential system,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

The accused also pleaded guilty to the charges of abduction and rape when the case was taken up for hearing by Negombo High Court Judge N.V. Karunathilaka.

The court fixed the case for January 13 for the issuance of summons to the prosecution witnesses.
Senior Deputy Solicitor Genenral Ayesha Jinasena with Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara and Shehan De Silva prosecuted.
