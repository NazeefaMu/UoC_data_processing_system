Video: 20A: UNP committed but cites practical difficulties
	
	The United National Party (UNP) said yesterday it was committed to the enactment of the 20th Amendment as soon as possible but that the next general elections would most likely be held under the current electoral system because of practical issues that might arise in implementing a new system.
	?We are keen to enact the 20A and we are optimistic about reaching an agreement within the next ten days with all parties on the proposed electoral reforms. However, the next general elections will most likely be held under the present system because of practical issues which are bound to crop up when implementing a new system,? Minister and UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim told a news conference.
	He said it was vitally important to hold a general election so that the people could elect a government of their choice and work out the modalities involved in changing the electoral system. ?
	Mr. Hashim said they had requested Party Leader and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to raise this matter of holding a general election soon when he attends the National Executive Council meeting. ?
	?We believe that general elections should be held without further delay. Once the election is held, we can implement the new electoral system and hold the next election under it,? he said. ?
	Meanwhile, commenting on the UNP?s May Day rally, Mr. Hashim said it was one of the most successful rallies in the history of the people and had proved that the majority of people were with the UNP.
	He said the number of participants at the UNP rally had exceeded the number of participants who took part in the other May Day rallies organised by other political parties and trade unions.
	?We are being labelled as a minority government in Parliament, but it has been proved that the majority of the people are with us. That is the UNP?s people power with which we were able to elect two ordinary citizens -- Ranasinghe Premadasa and Maithripala Sirisena as Presidents of Sri Lanka,? he said.

CB bonds: Opposition to inform foreign missions
	
The opposition is planning to pursue the probe into the alleged fraud in the sale of Central Bank Bonds by bringing it to the notice of foreign missions in Sri Lanka, former external affairs minister G.L. Peiris said yesterday.
He told Daily Mirror that he and a few other opposition MPs would carry out this task.
?We studied all aspects of this bond issue. It has far wider implications not only Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran,? Mr. Peiris said.
He said this bond issue had accumulative effects on the economy, and therefore the opposition would not relent in pursuit of action.
?It is a hemorrhage on the economy,? Mr. Peiris said.
Meanwhile the opposition has handed over a motion against Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran. The motion was signed by more than 90 MPs. (Kelum Bandara)

Documentary on pro-Tamil SL journalist screened
	
Taraki, a documentary on the travails of a pro-Tamil Sri Lankan journalist who was abducted and later found dead in the vicinity of the Sri Lankan parliament a decade ago, was screened at the Chennai Press Club on Sunday to mark World Press Freedom Day.
Reminiscing about the protagonist of the movie ?Taraki? Sivaram, the filmmaker S Someetharan explained how the documentary tried to depict the larger issue of curbs on freedom of expression of journalists across the globe.
?During Rajapakse?s time, most of the Tamil journalists left Sri Lanka. The situation is now better as many are able to express themselves freely, but the fear remains. Journalists are still under the Intelligence scanner in Sri Lanka,? said the 34-year-old, who was born and brought up in Lanka.
Under Gotabaya Rajapakse?s defence regime, journalists could be picked up at random. The situation, however, does not exist anymore, he added.
Someetharan, who shot the film for around four years and released it in 2012, noted that many of the journalists interviewed for the documentary were either shot dead later, or had to flee the country. Some were still missing, he said.
Sivaram, a militant-turned-journalist and a well-read social scientist, would work hard and travel extensively to churn out hard-hitting stories in the time of Rajapakse?s dictatorial rule. ?He would wear the same clothes for many days while in search of stories,? said Thisanayagam, his editor at Northern Herald.
?He was a freedom fighter; he first fought with arms and later with the pen,? said another editor. His wife and children said he would never tell them about the threats to his life and always advised them to be brave.
Sivaram was abducted on April 28 and the next day, his body was found in the vicinity of the Sri Lankan parliament, around 15 km away.
On the issue of his death, journalists and Someetharan himself acknowledged that no government in power in Lanka would conduct a proper investigations into Sivaram or other journalists? death, as it would point fingers at the complicity of the Lankan armed forces.
?Right now, the new dispensation is busy attacking the predecessor, so this is the best time for journalists to write as freely as possible,? Someetharan added. (Source: New Indian Express)

Indian fishermen to garner political support
	
Days after the Indian external affairs ministry made it clear to fishermen not to fish in the Sri Lankan waters and its reluctance to intervene in their release every time they are arrested by the Lankan navy; community leaders from Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu have decided to meet all political leaders to gather support for their cause. ?
Leaders of all fishermen associations met on Monday where they decided to seek support from the political parties also decided to call for a ?bandh? (a form of protest) in the coming days in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry condemning the central government.
"We condemn the central government for taking a stand of refusing to intervene in releasing our fishermen when they trespass into Sri Lankan waters for their livelihood and demand compensation for boats damaged in Sri Lankan custody," said Ramanathapuram district secretary of Tamil Nadu Mechanised Boat Fishermen Association, B Jesuraja.
Out of the 81 boats released by Sri Lanka, fishermen could salvage only 61 boats and the rest had to be abandoned since they were damaged beyond repair, the Times of India said.
Even among the 61 boats, nearly 10 had suffered extensive damage, fishermen said.
Sources said the meeting between Union minister Sushma Swaraj and fishermen leaders was a disappointment. "The minister asked us not to venture into Sri Lankan waters and carry out fishing in Indian waters but there is no fish in our waters," says D. Arockiam, a fisherman from Rameswaram.
Without trespassing, the livelihood of fishermen between Nagapattinam and Rameswaram coast will be at stake, they said.
The ministry has asked fishermen to look at alternate employment and venture into deep sea fishing.
"But we need time to shift to deep sea fishing and we proposed to hand over our boats under buyback scheme. The minister said she will consider buyback possibility," said Jesuraja.

NZ helping SL develop dairying
	
	New Zealand dairying expertise and technology is helping communities in Sri Lanka to develop a co-operative dairy farming farming network and raise their incomes.
	The woman heading the Wanni Dairy Regeneration programme, Selina Prem Kumar, has been in New Zealand to raise awareness and support for the project.
	It grew out of Sri Lanka's 25-year civil war, which resulted in hundreds of thousands of people being displaced and losing their livelihoods, and has brought together Singhalese, Tamil and Muslim communities.
	"Basically this is all about regenerating the dairy industry through which to provide direct marketing to improve the quality of milk and the quantity, through breeding, feeding and animal health, and also looking into the cold chain management so that the farmers will be able to earn more and this will put them back in a position that they will be able to be providers again to their families," Ms Kumar said.
	"That will help the children go back to school and also to address all their needs."
	Ms Kumar said the programme spanned 30 communities in the north of Sri Lanka and was helping about 2000 farmers, 40 percent of them women.
	It had lifted incomes for those farmers by 600 percent; some farmers earning about $NZ40 to $NZ50 a month a few years ago were now earning about $NZ300 a month, she said.
	The Sri Lankan dairy project was supported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the TEAR fund in New Zealand.
	New Zealand companies, QPod and Patton Refrigeration had contributed by adapting cooling technology for milk delivered to the processing factory. (Radio New Zealand News)
