A cancelled banquet that raised eyebrows!
	
?
The royal couple from the former empire and the delegates, from the Dragon?s land and the land of the Rising Sun, who arrived here as distinguished guests for the national day celebrations, were accorded a red carpet welcome.
?
However, the sudden cancellation of another event scheduled to take place after the celebrations had intrigued the political and diplomatic circles here.?
The event was a banquet arranged in honour of the distinguished foreign guests at an official mansion. Even the local bigwigs such as political party leaders had been invited to the event.?
Nobody seemed to know the reason for the cancellation, but a rumour said the order had been given from an authority in the highest echelons.

A gaffe that created an uneasy moment
	
?
A high level committee met the other day to finalize the arrangements relating to conducting the funeral of the late Ven. Bellanwila Wimalaratana Anunayake Thera with state honours.
?
A secretarial one from the nerve-centre of the country?s administration was among the lay dignitaries present at this meeting.? An organizer? ?invited the secretarial one to speak first as the latter was representing the highest authority in the country.
The secretarial one who took the floor kept on referring to the departed prelate as ?Ven. Bellanwila Dhammaratana Anunayake Thera?.?
It soon became apparent to every participant that Ven. Bellanwila Dhammaratana Thera who was present as large as life at this meeting was feeling acutely embarrassed due to the ?slip-of-the-tongue ?gaffe repeatedly being made by the secretarial one.
So a lay participant leaned over and whispered into the secretarial one?s ear that the bhikkhu seated in front was none other than Dhammaratana Thera and it was Wimalaratana Anunayake Thera who passed away.?
Then it was the secretarial one?s turn to go through a moment of severe embarrassment.

Attempt to mislead Muslims: SLPP
	
Attempts were being made to mislead the Muslims in Sri Lanka in the aftermath of the Local Government Election victory of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), the party said today.
In a statement, party Chairman G.L. Peiris said following the SLPP?s resounding victory at the LG elections, a rumour had begun to circulate in the social media that the Bodu Bala Sena had made Facebook posts in support of the SLPP.
?Then articles appeared in the newspapers quoting a letter written by Mr.?N.M. Ameen of the Muslim Council stating that SLPP cadres had allegedly harassed several Muslim individuals. If any such incidents had occurred, they should be reported to the Police and dealt with,? Prof. Peiris said.
He said the public was well aware of the strategies that were orchestrated before the last Presidential Election to alienate the Muslim community from their leadership.
?The book titled Yuga Peraliya has explained the strategies adopted to send the Muslim community en masse onto the other side before the last Presidential Election. We admit that our Government was not decisive enough in dealing with this conspiracy,? he said.
He said there was yet another spate of attacks on Muslim businesses and houses and then a monk at the centre of these incidents was granted bail three times in a single day and everything was swept under the carpet.
?The Government never appointed a Commission to look into the far more important issue of the Aluthgama incident, because all the perpetrators are now in the Yahapalana Government. The Muslim community has now realised the deception that has been practised on them, and the results of the LG election clearly reflects that.
It is therefore not surprising that conspiratorial elements are once again at work. The Government should immediately establish a Commission of Inquiry into the Aluthgama incident, the sudden flare-up of extremist activity in 2017 and the Gintota incident. In the meantime, the law should be implemented strictly on such incidents in the future,? he said.

Deposit at the ?Love Bank? this Valentine?s Day

THE HINDU, 13th FEBRUARY, 2018
In a small medieval Slovak town, couples are getting ready on Valentine?s Day to make a ?deposit? about their romance in a place dedicated to love stories.
The ?Love Bank? is the main attraction of an exhibition commemorating the world?s longest love poem, ?Marina? by Slovak poet Andrej Sladkovic. Written in 1844, the 2,900-line long poem tells the tale of the doomed love between the poet and Maria Pischlova.
They were star-crossed lovers but unlike Romeo and Juliet their tragic romance is a true story.
Marina?s parents shunned the poor poet and forced her to marry a wealthy gingerbread maker. The house where Marina lived in the former silver mining town of Banska Stiavnica is now known as the ?Epicentre of Love? and features an interactive exhibition inspired by the poem, including a ?love-o-meter? measuring the strength of a couple?s affection. ?Our visitors say they are amazed by how a part of history and a poem that was on their elementary school compulsory reading list has been turned into a hands-on experience,? said Katarina Javorska, spokeswoman for the NGO running the exhibition.
For many couples, it?s the ?Love Bank? that attracts them to the site where they can store and preserve mementos of their romance.

Following the untimely passing away of a scholarly monk Critics want 'Elite' Unchain Bond with Jumbo
	
Elephants are becoming the not-so-gentle giants of the jungle! The last time you heard good about an elephant would have probably been in a history lesson and chances are that you will hear more evil about these giants in future. With the tragic killing of the Galgamuwa cross-tusker, a series of elephant deaths made headlines during the latter part of 2017. Another addition to the jumbo-related tragedies was the untimely death of Ven. Dr. Bellanwila Wimalaratana Thera. The monk?s death is a message to those who still engage in keeping elephants in captivity.
The story of ?Myan Kumara?
The Thera had said that he fell, but wasn?t attacked by the tusker
	They sometimes knock their trunks and tusks against people
	Positive Reinforcement Training should be encouraged
	?Myan?Kumara? currently?at the Daladawatta Temple, Wadduwa
The issue of captive elephants has been dormant for some time with no solution offered by the authorities concerned. With the introduction of processions during the Kandyan Era, elephants have played a prominent role during ceremonial events. The capture and taming of elephants dates back to the time of the Indus Valley civilisation approximately 4000 years ago when they were captured, trained and made to work. Captive Asian elephants are erroneously referred to as ?domesticated? after they are subject to a period of taming. At the onset of the Thera?s death speculation was rife that he was ?attacked? by ?Myan Kumara? - the temple tusker. However the Daily Mirror??learned that at the onset of this incident, the tusker is being ill-treated and shifted from place to place.?
Hence the Daily Mirror?sheds light on the incident, precautions to take during a chest injury as experienced by the late prelate and the consequences of keeping elephants in captivity.?
?Elephants aren?t ill-treated at the temple??
-Ven. Dhammaratana?
Talking to the Daily Mirror, the present Chief Incumbent of the Bellanwila Rajamaha Viharaya, Ven. Dr. Bellanwila Dhammaratana Nayaka Thera said that he was overseas at the time this incident had taken place. ?I only know that Ven. Wimalaratana Thera fell. I didn?t see what happened, so I cannot tell what exactly happened. In fact nobody had seen what had happened. The mahout was on holiday and on the day of this incident the elephant was tied to a coconut tree in the backyard. However the priest had had a severe fall in a way that damaged his ribs. But even at the hospital the Thera had said that he fell and hadn?t mentioned about the tusker attacking him. There are all sorts of stories being written in papers and circulated on social media, but none of these people has seen what happened to the priest,? said Ven. Dr. Bellanwila Dhammaratana Nayaka Thera.?
Speaking further the Thera said that if the elephant was angry and actually attacked as said, he would have grabbed the priest once again and trampled him. ?But nothing of that sort took place and people were able to move the injured Thera away from the elephant. Myan Kumara doesn?t eat just because there?s food. He needs to be fed. So at such times we have to hold him from the tusk, stand by the side and place the food in his mouth. From my own experiences I remember falling down when an elephant?s trunk knocked against my back when I was in my twenties. The late priest was 76 and he was quite feeble. It is possible that he fell during such an instance. However all medical treatment was given quite successfully, but he unfortunately passed away,? added Ven. Dr. Bellanwila Dhammaratana Nayaka Thera.?
When asked about allegations regarding ill-treating the elephant, temple officials confirmed that the elephant is currently at the Daladawatta Temple in Wadduwa but will be brought back to the temple this week. In response to these allegations Ven. thera said that most animal rights activists are quite ignorant and added, ?No elephant at Bellanwila Rajamaha Viharaya has been ill-treated. The elephant is now in another location and I went to feed him on Sunday (February 11) as well. We look after them so well; they get enough food and when they fall sick we get local physicians (veda mahaththaya) to treat them. If those activists are so concerned, why can?t they keep these animals with them? Had these elephants been in the wild they would have been shot dead. It?s quite expensive to look after them, but we bear the cost since they are our treasure?.
Doctors observe heavy force behind the fall?
Speaking to the? the team of doctors that attended to the prelate, during the time of the injury, said that when he was rushed to the Kalubowila Teaching Hospital the prelate had suffered severe blunt trauma to the chest where 10 ribs on the right and six on the left were damaged. ?The nature of the injuries showed that the prelate had fallen down with a heavy force. If not such injuries would only persist if one has a bone disease. The priest had mentioned that he fell after feeding the elephant and hadn?t mentioned about an attack,? the doctors said.?
The team further said that the staff at the Kalubowila Hospital had administered the appropriate initial treatment, which included inserting a tube into the right chest, administering high flow of oxygen and appropriate pain killers. ?A cardiologist at the Kalubowila Teaching hospital first assessed his chest and performed an echocardiograph.? He then stated that the priest was fit to be transferred to undergo chest surgery. This surgery lasted seven hours. During the surgery the damaged lung and ribs were repaired using 57 specialised titanium screws and plates. However, according to the attending general physician, the priest was also having diabetes and high blood pressure but these conditions were controlled.? they said.?
Although the team put in their fullest efforts to save the priest, he succumbed to a myocardial infarction (heart attack) two hours after the operation. ?If he was attacked by the tusker as per speculation, he would have been experiencing severe mental trauma as well. That along with his age, the duration of the surgery and the severity of the injuries could have contributed to the priest?s untimely death,? they added.?
??Time rife for elephants to live chain-free???
-Otara Gunewardene
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, wildlife enthusiast and Director of Passion Otara Gunewardene said the time is ride to set these innocent animals free. ?A large number of people are now aware of the suffering we have caused to these animals over the years and great change is taking place across the world. Even in Sri Lanka there is a much greater understanding with compassionate citizens who know that change is needed and are speaking out for our elephants. It is not to do with going against culture, but to do with awakening of our consciousness to understand another being?s suffering; that all things done in the past are not always right. This is not to do only with animals, but so many things like slavery, women not being able to vote, humans in zoos were also considered alright at one time.
?There are ways that mahouts could be trained,? Gunewardene said elaborating on ways to train elephants without using bull hooks. ?I have seen it with my own eyes. I spent a week in Nepal with Carol Buckley where mahouts used Bull hooks and elephants who were all chained now live chain free and no bull hooks are used. She worked with the Government of Nepal and places like Tiger Tops to make them all chain-free. Everyday we would walk with the elephants in the jungle for them to have exercise, to the river for them to have their baths, to cut grass for their food and even walk through villages with about nine elephants in a row with no bull hooks at all. They just used verbal commands and the mahouts? legs to guide the elephants.
If Nepal can do it why can?t we? I have offered the zoo committee that was set about a year ago to bring Carol down to make the elephants at the zoo chain-free. I have spoken to so many others to change Pinnawala to be a chain-free orphanage for elephants, but they are just not interested. It was finally added to the last budget, but we are yet to see if anything happens about that in the coming months. Temples and other religious places of worship shouldn?t keep elephants in captivity because the time has come where elephants must live chain-free. It is also their duty to show people what is right for these animals and not to convince them into thinking that having them on chains is the right thing.??
Even if temples have them they should be in an area where they are free. It is not that we can?t find better solutions for all our elephants; it?s just that we don?t want to nor do we have the leadership, the vision and the heart to create a better life for all lives in our country. This is especially for those like the captive elephants who suffer in silence for our entertainment, profit and ?merit?,? said Gunewardene.?
Dominance-Based versus Positive Reinforcement Training?
In the modern times, elephants are considered a prestige symbol. Therefore the elite tend to keep them at their houses in a confined space treating them with everything under the sun. But, freedom is all that they need. According to experts who have studied extensively on elephant behaviour, there?s nothing called a ?domestic elephant?. Elephants could be trained using two methods:
1. Dominance-based training ? Where humans use dominance and negative reinforcement such as inflicting pain. Individuals who use this method believe that dominance is the only way to control elephants.?
2. Positive Reinforcement Training? - Where the elephant is being rewarded for obeying the verbal command they receive. This is a non-violent and gentle way to train elephants and ensures control of the animal using mahouts.
Experts further reiterate that while the first method is frequently used in Sri Lanka, the second has never even been tried. Dominance-based training involves breaking the animal?s spirit. They obey the master and they are scared of ill-treatment, but this pressure of ill-treatment builds up in the animal and that?s why there are instances of elephants killing mahouts. In Nepal, elephants at the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC) have been trained without the use of chains. They travel through towns and it has been observed that these animals are well-behaved and obey the verbal commands of the mahouts. What is quite interesting to note is that mahouts don?t force the elephants to do what they want. They allow the elephant to take the decision; for example if they encounter a difficult route to get to another side of a river, the mahout doesn?t force the elephant to take that same route. Instead the elephant will find its way to the other bank. However not every elephant in Nepal behaves this way. Therefore it shows that Positive Reinforcement Training is more effective. If the elephant is treated well, the elephant will treat you in return, but the underlined fact is that they are wild.?
??Mahouts need to be trained???- Jayantha Jayewardene
?Elephants have been held in captivity as part of our traditions,? said Asian Elephant Expert and researcher Jayantha Jayewardene. ?They were used to plough lands, move stones, build palaces and do other heavy work. But sadly, these elephants are not domesticated. They have been caught from the wild and trained. But they should be allowed to live freely. During the time of Minister Kalugalla, the capture of wild elephants was banned, but this wasn?t implemented. Today the wild elephant population and the tusker population have drastically reduced. What started at 700 has now reduced to less than a 100 tamed elephants.
They are now being used during ceremonies and processions. With the introduction of backhoes and other machinery, the need for elephants to carry out heavy work doesn?t exist. But rich families wanted to own elephants as a symbol of prestige. These elephants cannot be sent back to the wild as well. Since temples cannot afford to look after these giants, they were then given to the daayakayas (main contributors to the temple fund). Hence the temple only wants the elephant during a ceremony,??emphasised Jayewardene.?
Stressing on the issue of undertrained mahouts, Jayewardene further said that mahouts have a theory that by hitting an elephant they can control it. ?Back in the day elephants and mahouts had a strong relationship. But today, being a mahout is another blue-collar job. Mahouts need to be trained to be kind to elephants,? he concluded.?
Precautions to take during a chest injury
According to the doctors, these incidents are quite common in Sri Lanka and each year people die from road traffic accidents alone and a majority of them succumb to chest injuries. Several precautions could be considered if a person experiences such an injury. The first step would always be to call for help.?
It is important to suspect a spinal injury as well. In which case, put a collar around the neck of the patient.
	Put him on a stretcher in the logrolling position, so that the spine will not flex.?
	Call a van or a spacious vehicle to transport the patient if an ambulance isn?t available.
	Inform the nearest hospital that a patient with severe injuries is arriving, so that the medical staff can be ready. Don?t try to admit the patient to the best hospital as it would consume time that otherwise can be given to the patient. Therefore admit him/her to the nearest Government hospital or a decent private institution.
	If the patient is not breathing artificial resuscitation (mouth-mouth breathing) could be administered if no other facility is available. Heart massage and other cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) will have to be given at the site of the accident.
	If the person is unconscious position him to a side with the head turned downwards.
	If bleeding from a limb, keep it raised or keep a clean piece of cloth and press the area to control bleeding. (Tourniquet procedure is not recommended)
	If the patient has wounds in the chest air will pass through its cavities. In such instances cover the cavity using tape on three sides to prevent the patient from breathing up. (Don?t cover it fully because if air builds up in the chest it could be life-threatening)
	Don?t pull any sort of splint that has pierced into the body as it should better be removed under the instructions of superiors in a hospital.
	It?s alright to sprinkle water if the patient feels faintish, but never attempt to feed him or give water to drink. If the wounds are severe he will be taken in for surgery on an?empty stomach.
	Someone who knows the medical history of the patient should accompany him during every possible instance. (There could be clinic books and other documents which the medical staff could?refer to.)
	In the case of a mass injury always inform the Police. (Emergency numbers such as 911 are available 24X7).

Help Malintha to stand above Autism
	
K.P Malintha Perera, born on the 18th November 1995, was the first child of the family and the pride and joy of his parents. He was a happy and a healthy child until the parents noticed that he was lagging behind in speech, when he was around 1 1/2 years. His vocabulary consisted of just a few words that he used very occasionally.
The parents suspected that something had to be wrong and took him to a doctor. At a time when autism was still a much obscure topic, there were many a month when that they had to take their son to countless doctors, make him undergo countless tests before it was diagnosed that Malintha was suffering from a severe form of the Autism?Spectrum Disorder.? ?
Malintha?s father, Premasiri Perera, described the struggle that the family underwent afterwards. Malintha?s condition went downhill from the onset, with him being unresponsive to the parents, even when he was called directly by name. He was agitated at times and started walking in tiptoes as children with this condition sometimes do. Premasiri explains how they homeschooled him because there wasn?t a single school that had the resources or the experience to teach a child with Malintha?s condition at the time.
Rather than teaching him Math and Science, his parents struggled to teach him to do basic things like eating and washing by himself. Since knowledge was scarce, there were many times that they had to trust their flow and improvise. He recalls how they took him everyday for walks in the beach to make him drop the habit of tiptoe walking, since he had to use his whole foot in walking in the sand. He recalled sadly how Malintha was isolated from his peers and how the society considered him a ?lost cause?.? ?
But the journey, difficult as it was, had its rewards. Malintha is a talented painter and Premasiri said that he has a uncanny talent for languages. He can translate on paper several languages including Sinhala, English Tamil and Japanese with no formal training.? ?
As with other parents with differently abled children, his greatest worry is caring for his son in the future, when they are no more. With this in mind he is now involved in a project which teaches autistic people to earn money by doing handcrafts. He had to give up his previous job which involved exporting musical instruments and spices to dedicate time for his son.? ?
Recently, Premasiri and his wife received new hope. This was because they heard about a new treatment method called ?stem cell therapy? for Autistic patients. This treatment method is still not available in Sri Lanka, though Premasiri and other parents of Autistic children are doing their utmost to get it established soon in Sri Lanka. Meanwhile Premasiri is trying hard to get his son treated in India, which is estimated to cost around 9000 US dollars (around 1400000 SL rupees) Premasiri and his wife cannot afford to bear such a huge expense for treatment.
They have obtained around two lakhs, with the help of generous people. These parents are reaching out to generous souls who understand the agony of parents with a sick child like Malintha. He is to be admitted at the StemAsia Hospital and Research centre in India for treatment in mid February. Malintha?s parents are extremely grateful if any form of help is extended to them in curing their son.? ?
Individuals who wish to make donations should deposit their contributions to A/C number 8590009605 at Commercial Bank and maintained under the name K.P.B Perera.? You can contact Malintha?s father on 0785582647 for more information.? ? ?

?
The revelation was about how a Betel party senior in yahapalanaya slept all his cares away while an important Bill was being passed into law.?
It was the day of the last sitting for the debate on the bill on the new election system. This senior often found snoozing during the Diyawanna sessions was in a deep slumber at the time the vote on the Bill was taken. And none had thought it important to waken him either.
By the time, this senior woke up, the Bill had already been put to vote and passed and all party leaders were leaving the chamber, the Red leader recalled.

IFRS 9 to drive modest rise in insurers? income volatility: Fitch
	
Insurers are likely to see a moderate increase in investment income volatility following the implementation of IFRS 9 accounting standards for financial instruments at the start of 2018, as more financial assets will be valued on a fair-value basis, says Fitch Ratings.
IFRS 17, the new standard for insurance contract accounting that is due to be implemented in 2021, is likely to pose a greater challenge to insurers, both operationally and financially.
Insurers will have to re-assess their business models through the lens of the new standards, as their business models will determine the classification of financial assets. IFRS 9 prescribes three classification categories: Fair value through profit and loss (FVPL), fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) and amortised cost. The FVPL classification will be the least favoured by insurers, as it requires changes in fair value to be recognised in profit and loss as they arise, potentially increasing earning volatility.
IFRS 9 also replaces incurred-based credit losses with an expected credit-loss model. The previous standard was less forward-looking, with losses recognised only upon objective evidence of impairment. The new model may create more loss-provisioning volatility for insurers with loan portfolios, as it is based on macroeconomic forecasts.
The bulk of insurers? investments remain in traditional fixed-income-type securities and most of these are likely to be initially classified as FVOCI or amortised cost. As such, we expect the impact on insurers? financials to be manageable. However, most equities could now be classified as FVPL, although insurers may separate a proportion as FVOCI owing to IFRS 17 considerations. Overall, the amount of financial assets measured by FVPL will increase compared with the previous standards.
Life insurers are likely to see a greater impact on income volatility than non-life insurers due to the long-term nature of their businesses and higher exposure to non-fixed-income investments. IFRS 9 should be viewed in tandem with the imminent introduction of IFRS 17. The new standards together move the industry to a new accounting era of increased transparency, granularity and comparability.
The interaction of the two new reporting standards may affect insurers? financials, as investment assets and insurance contract liabilities are often managed together. Insurers will have to consider carefully the implication of these interactions. Fitch recognises the potential for accounting mismatches and will account for this?
where possible.

This dance item was readied as a feature on a proposal by a key purohita who wanted to use it as a symbolic message that the government is committed to fortifying the schoolchildren with the latest technology. This purohita hailing from the South had also proposed featuring two other dance items as well, one sporting telescopes and the other sporting world globes.

Not my job to issue final results: EC
	
The Elections Commission was neither under obligation to issue final results of the LG polls nor was its job, Elections Commission (EC) Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said today.
He added however that a booklet would be issued on February 28 including all data, statistics and information related to the February 10 polls.
He said the EC was Constitutionally mandated to issue final results only at a Referendum and Provincial Councils, Parliamentary and Presidential polls because results of any of these polls become legally valid after the declaration of the results by the EC.
At an LG election, results are declared at the polling station and all voters at the village level know the election results in a few hours after the poll. Therefore, the issue of releasing final results does not arise.
Mr Deshapriya told reporters yesterday that the drastic changes have to be introduced to the Local Authorities Election (Amendment) Act no. 22 of 2012 as the selection of members from two lists and nomination of 25% women members to Local Government bodies from each political party or independent group on election results had become a mess and in many instances, it was a difficult task.
Commenting on the delay in releasing election results to the media on Saturday night, Mr Deshapriya said there was a computer malfunctioning at the computer unit at the Colombo University after entering wrong data.
?The most progressive aspect of this poll that held under the new electoral system is the sharp drop in violence.
?There has been no report of a single violence of serious nature or a death. Therefore, we must nurture the culture of non-violence as we did at this election and apply it to all future elections,? Mr Deshapriya stressed.(Sandun A Jayasekera)

On films seen Insight into world cinema
	
?On films Seen? is a compilation of articles and film reviews written by veteran film critic K. S. Sivakumaran spanning the years 1990 to 2017. He says he is unable to trace some of the material written in the 1980s, but this collection feels wholesome enough, containing 58 film reviews and articles on the subject?of filmmaking.? ?
Through his writing, Sivakumaran has brought a level of understanding about Tamil films not available to non-Tamil speaking audiences. As very few Tamil films were made in Sri Lanka during the difficult decades of civil war, many of those films reviewed by him were made in India. These include not only Tamil cinema but films made in Hindi, Malayalam, Gujarati, Bengali and other Indian languages, and even in Assamese and Manipuri, as well as Asian and Western films screened at major Indian film festivals held in cities such as Bangalore, Chennai and Mumbai.? ?
In ?A Note on Lankan Tamil films?, the author gives an overview of what has been achieved here, noting that the total does not exceed 50. The chapter titles will give an idea of the range of subjects ? ?Language and Structure in Cinema,? ?The Role of the Spectator in Film,? ?Lanka-born Balu Mahendra talks about films,? ?Archana: Tamil Cinema?s thinking girl,? ?Bhagavad Gita in Sanskrit,? ?Hindi Films come of age,? ?Kavita Joshi: In the art of filmmaking,? ?Bengali film on conjugal relationship,; ?Among the Kerala Movie Freaks,? etc.? ?
Through his writing, Sivakumaran has brought a level of understanding about Tamil films not available to non-Tamil speaking audiences.?
He has included reviews of several Sinhala films such as Madhu Samaya and Umayangana. The international films include those from Western and Eastern Europe, Latin America, South Korea, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Britain, and veteran directors such as Clint Eastwood and David Lean are discussed. But this book is a valuable primer mainly on Indian cinema, with useful sketches of a new generation of actors and film makers from many parts of the country.
As Sinhala audiences are by and large only familiar with Bollywood products, this is a very useful survey indeed, introducing directors such as T. V. Chandran, Sharada Ramanadan, G. Aravindan, composers such as Lalgudi Jayaraman and actors such as Naseeruddin Shah and Mohan Lal, a superstar in Malayalam films.? ?
One column is devoted to Malayali filmmaker G. Aravindan who died in 1991. Aravindan, whom the author met at the Chennai international film festival, was a composer of Karnatic and Hindustani classical music, and he wrote the score for the film ?Piravi? by Shaji.? ?
In Oh Culcutta, he discusses the sprawling city as well as the play by British playwright and critic Kenneth Tynan, in which the players appeared in the nude. He notes laconically: ?There is absolutely no respect for?traffic regulations.?? ?
Published by?S. Godage?& Brothers,?the book is?priced at?Rs. 650.? ?
Another column discusses the Ismail Merchant-James Ivory combination, which resulted in such fine films as ?Heat and Dust? based on the novel by Ruth Prawer Jhabwala. Talking about Tamil cinema, he notes that no Tamil film was recognized as India?s best film until 1997 when Kaathal Kottai bagged three national awards. While the name of Sri Devi may be familiar, one learns that Waheeda Rehman, Rekha, Hema Malini and Prabhu Deva too, hailed from South India.? ?
All in all, this is an excellent reference book for anyone interested in Indian cinema but also non-commercial work from many parts of the world.? ?

Prez, PM should apologize to the people
	
President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe should admit their mistake and apologize to the people, Purawesi Balaya Co-Convener K.W. Janaranjana said yesterday.
He told a news conference that the President and the Prime Minister should make up their minds to work according to the mandate given to them in 2015 and underscored the fact that they would not leave any room for the Rajapaksa regime to return to power again.
Mr. Janaranjana said the mandate given to the President and the Prime Minister would not become null and void in the wake of the results of the Local Government elections.
?Today we are facing the repercussions of not carrying out the people's mandate. This is like the race between the hare and the tortoise. As the government did not act on its mandate using the authority vested in it, a tortoise that was not in contention won the race. The rulers should keep this in mind,? he said.
Mr. Janaranjana said they met the President and the Prime Minister yesterday and pointed out that civil society and Purawesi groups still had the opportunity of discussing their issues with the two leaders.
?This kind of freedom is commendable. That was not possible during the Rajapaksa regime. We expect an action plan going beyond the discussions and acknowledge that the government has done a huge amount of work,? he said. (Sujith Hewajulige)

## Title: Prof. J.E. Jayasuriya Visionary educationist and ideal teacher
## Section: News Features

Prof. J.E. Jayasuriya Visionary educationist and ideal teacher
	
I consider it an honour and a privilege to be provided with the opportunity to pay my tribute to the late Prof. J.E. Jayasuriya whose 100th birth anniversary falls on February 14. Unfortunately I didn?t have the privilege of being a student of Prof. Jayasuriya nor had I any personal acquaintance with him. However, I was fortunate to have some links with him through the prism of his publications and writings and the verbal lore of his colleagues and students who have greatly admired and revered him.? ?
Born in 1918, he started his primary education at Nawalapitiya Anuruddha Vidyalaya and then joined Dharmasoka College Ambalangoda before finally crossing over to Wesley College, Colombo. In 1933, he sat the Cambridge Senior Examination and displayed his brilliance by securing the third place in order of merit among all candidates of the British Empire. In recognition of his brilliant performance, he was awarded with a scholarship to the University College, Colombo. In 1939, at the age of 21, he graduated with a First Class in Mathematics.? ?
Prof. Jayasuriya commenced his career as an educational administrator being the first principal of Dharmapala Vidyalaya, Pannipitiya. In recognition of his abilities Dr. C.W.W. Kannangara invited him to be in charge of the central school established in the Minister?s own electorate, Matugama.? ?
On his return after Post Graduate studies at the Institute of Education, University of London he was in charge of Mathematics education at the Teachers? College Maharagama until appointed as a lecturer in the Department of Education of the University of Ceylon. In 1957, he succeeded Prof. T.L Green as Professor of Education. He became the first Sri Lankan to hold this post.? ?
In his capacity as Professor and the Head of Department, Prof. Jayasuriya undertook the task of professionalizing education. He was the role model for all the academic community with his professional attitude, open- mindedness, multi-disciplinary versatility and commitment to his vocation. It was his vision that made him initiate the first undergraduate degree in education, the Bachelor of Education at the University of Peradeniya in the late nineteen sixties. This he did to ensure the pre-service training of graduate teachers.
Even though the programme was suspended after a few years in operation, the majority of the first generation of B.Ed. graduates have achieved high professional status both locally and globally. The popularity of this course, which is now offered at the University of Colombo, testifies to the foresight of Prof. Jayasuriya in developing this programme. However, while there are moves to expand the Bachelor of Education programmes it is necessary to review these programmes in the light of Prof. Jayasuriya?s vision to maintain quality in the B.Ed. course he designed.? ?
Intelligence testing? ?
Prof. Jayasuriya was a pioneer in introducing intelligence testing. The National Education Society Intelligence Test, which he helped to develop, was the only standardised test available for teachers at that time in national languages. He also adapted the Raven?s Non- verbal test to Sri Lankan standards. For many years these were the instruments used in testing.? ?
The first National Education Commission ever to be appointed, in 1961/62 of which Prof. Jayasuriya was the Chairman, proposed far-reaching reforms in many areas of education.? ?
At a time when educational research wasn?t in vogue in Sri Lanka Prof. Jayasuriya was a forerunner in the culture of research with an array of research on diverse fields. He was also a prolific writer of books and monographs, both in Sinhala and English. They are a great treasure trove to students and researches even today. Undoubtedly he personified the ideal university teacher, dedicated to the three goals of a university: teaching, research and service to society.? ?
Prof. Jayasuriya was also known as the father of Population Education in the Asian region. After premature retirement from University service he took up an assignment as the Regional Advisor in Population Education at UNESCO, Bangkok and worked there for five years. He headed a team of specialists to help the countries of the region to forge ahead with this novel program. Prof. Jayasuriya developed and published a Source Book on Population Education in Asia which was widely distributed in the region and was influential in the evolution of the concepts and programming practices of population education. Further he launched programming missions in the countries in the region which led to the establishment of population education projects. He was also responsible for setting up a clearing house of publications on population education at UNESCO Office to which he himself authored many articles.? ?
His books made learning a pleasure As mentioned at the outset I was acquainted with Prof. Jayasuriya through his books. I was fortunate to be one of the last batches of students to learn Mathematics using the set of books he authored. Learning Mathematics was a pleasure as the concepts were presented clearly and logically with adequate exercises to practice what is learned. Sadly this is not the case in relation to learning mathematics in Sri Lanka today.? ?
Many who have written about Prof. Jayasuriya have highlighted his forthrightness, fearless advocacy of the cause he believed in and an uncompressing intellectual honesty. These qualities are exhibited through his writings especially in Some Issues in Ceylon Education- which is a critical reaction to the distortion of his recommendations of the National Education Commission Report (1962).?
In the book During British Rule in Ceylon,? he analyses the education system during British rule in retrospect. In the book Education in the Third world ? Some Reflections he highlights the need to deviate from the western education models and how Sri Lanka has lost its direction in?education policy.? ?
At a time when Sri Lanka?s education reforms are being discussed, it is most opportune to step back and glimpse at the views and vision of an educationist par excellence of the times belonging to yesteryear. The medium of instruction, English language education, free education, expanding Bachelor of Education programmes and Private sector involvement in education are all current issues which had been discussed by Prof. Jayasuriya in his publications. In discussing the British period in Sri Lanka in retrospect he discusses many dualities that existed in the school system at that time.
Regarding English language education he states that ?compulsory English for all children in and above grade 11 is one of the greatest deceptions perpetrated on the people of this country?. He cites two reasons to justify his stand. About 20 -25% of schools never had a single teacher for English and secondly the calibre of the teachers recruited to teach English was ?substandard?. Regarding free education, he says through his writings that ?education became indeed free for all, but what was free was a good education for the few and a bad education for the many?. These statements are valid for the present as well. Hence Prof. Jayasuriya is truly a visionary educationist and his insights should guide the present policy makers.? ?

Some SLFP Ministers to join UNP
	
Some Ministers belonging to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) are planning to team up with the United National Party(UNP) to form the new coalition government, while others are trying to align with the opposition.
The two parties are trying to part ways, in the aftermath of the electoral defeat at the local government polls. However, some SLFP ministers will throw their weight behind the UNP while the others will sit in the opposition as a separate group. They also have plans to rally behind other political forces in the opposition.
Some of them seek to join hands with the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna which won the elections concluded last Saturday. However, the SLPP has laid down conditions for it. (Kelum Bandara)

Speed radars operational on Expressways from today
	
The new speed-detecting system would be operational on Expressways from today, Expressway Operation Maintenance and Management Division said.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror Southern Expressway Deputy Director R.A.D. Kahatapitiya said the operation of the new speed-detecting system would help reduce the accidents on the Expressway, while keeping the maximum speed to 100kmph.
?With the use of the new speed-detecting system, vehicles will be compelled to maintain the speed to 100 kmph and the drivers exceeding the limit will be fined,? he said.
Mr Kahatapitiya said drivers found exceeding the 100kmph speed limit would be given a photograph taken at the time the vehicle had exceeded the speed limit.
He said the photograph would include the vehicle number, observed time and the speed at the time.
The new system is capable of capturing these details even at night.
Mr Kahatapitiya said though they were aware that several drivers were known to exceed the speed limit, they were not equipped with a sufficient number of speed detectors nor did they function at night. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

UPFA and SLFP request President to appoint new PM
	
The United People?s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) requested President Maithripala Sirisena today to take steps to appoint a new Prime Minister who can muster the majority support in Parliament.
UPFA MP Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara told Daily Mirror yesterday that party Secretary Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera and Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) National Organizer Science and Technology Minister Susil Premajayantha had made this request from the President in writing.
Mr. Jayasekara also revealed that the UPFA had decided to propose the name of Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva for the post of Prime Minister.
The letter says, ?The UNP and the SLFP agreed to form the national unity government only for two years. That period has now lapsed. During this period, UNP leader Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe oversaw subjects such as constitution making, foreign affairs, judicial matters, economic matters and law and order. Though it was difficult for us to agree to some decisions taken by the Prime Minister, we adhered to them as we were collectively bound. Instead of taking action against corruption and fraud as discussed during the election, it is not a secret that a major fraud, namely the Central Bank bond scam, took place with the knowledge of the Prime Minister.?
The two ministers wrote that people gave a verdict against the government for going against the norms and principles of good governance.
They said it was unacceptable to allow the Prime Minister to continue to rule the country given the extremely small mandate received by his party at the recently concluded LG polls.

Will intervene but won?t take part: JO
	
The Joint Opposition would intervene to form a Government against the UNP, JO MP Dullas Alahapperuma said today.?However, he said that the JO would not participate in it.
Addressing the weekly news briefing, JO National Organiser MP Dullas Alahapperuma said the UPFA had expressed that it would form one of its own Government without the UNP in it.
?We don?t know how they would do it. We are not aware of the mechanism. However, if this is possible, we will intervene in the formation of an anti-UNP Government but won?t take part in it.?Our objective is not to send away former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to another faction to create a Government but to bring the Government to Mr Rajapaksa,? he said.
However, he said reports that the UNP and UPFA would break away from the Unity Government were unconvincing and seemed like scripted.
?This is a creation by the Government to divert the attention from the mounting people?s opposition against it. The two factions parted ways before the Local Government (LG) election, would rejoin without a delay,? he said.
Meanwhile, he said Speaker Karu Jayasuriya should recognise the Joint Opposition as the official Opposition in Parliament.
?We are the only faction in Parliament which has not accepted any portfolios. We are not even a part of the Government. A 10 % of Ministers in the Cabinet and 20 % of Parliamentarians do not have a people?s mandate.
?The present Opposition was appointed through the back door. However, people voted overwhelmingly for us at the election defeating all other parties at the LG polls. Therefore, at least now, we should be given our due place in Parliament. We request Speaker to recognise us as the official Opposition and hope to meet him in person next week in this regard,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Won't join any Govt; will cooperate on progressive matters: TNA
	
Amid speculation of a new ruling coalition, the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) said yesterday it would not become part of any government, but would cooperate on progressive measures adopted by it as far as the issues of Tamil people were concerned.
Jaffna District TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran told Daily Mirror the government formed in 2015, invited his party to join but the request was turned down.
He said there were fundamental issues faced by the people who supported the TNA but as the main Opposition in Parliament, the TNA supported the national unity government on progressive measures.
?There is no change in that policy. We will support whatever government if it takes steps to resolve the concerns of the Tamil people,? the MP said.
When asked whether it should take progressive measures with regard to the political question, he said in such a scenario the TNA would extend its cooperation (Kelum Bandara)
