A glimpse at the body?s blueprints
	
?
The level of organisation within the body is so vast that even after much advancements in medicine, scientists are a long way from figuring things out completely. Look at a bowler at a cricket match or a ballerina and try to think of the coordination that is going within their bodies in order to maintain precise actions from their torso to their little fingers. Now visualise the inside of the body. While all these things are going on outside, there are a thousand things happening inside the body at the same time. The heart keeps pumping blood, the kidneys filter blood, the stomach is busy digesting food, the brain is processing the inputs that are coming from all the sensory organs etc. Each of these organs comprises cells. Even while you are reading this, thousands of new cells are being generated in various parts of the body, while a thousand others die.? ?
Now let?s look at one of those cells. It?s a direct descendant from the first ever cell that was formed when the genetic material from the mother?s cell got together with those of the father and replicated to produce a foetus. The cell?s begin, differentiate, function and replicate giving rise to more cells. Even their death is tightly regulated by those said genetic material.? ?
Let?s go into a little more detail. Cell replication is a process where two cells result from division of one cell. All cell organelle, including the genetic material, is replicated. This is a very complicated as well as an interesting process, but that is a story for another time. Replication is made unpredictable by it?s high chance to produce ?mistakes?, which will in turn give rise to many disease conditions.? ?
?Do you remember that I told you that all this started with that one cell? Then how come there are thousands of different cell groups in our body? Nerve cells, epithelial cells, blood cells, muscle cells, the list goes on. That?s due to a process called cell differentiation, where a cell, after dividing acquires special features specific for a certain group of cells. These features are so specific that when it goes beyond a certain level, they loose the ability to replicate. Nerve cells and blood cells are examples of cells that can?t give rise to similar cells.? ?
?Then comes the cell death. It?s hard to believe that each cell in our body is pre-programmed to self destruct at command, but scientists have found that this is the case. This process is called ?apoptosis? or programmed cell death. This ?command? can come from the inside of the cell itself, specially when the cell is old, or from the nearby structures; which is how the fingers and toes are separated from each other in an embryo. This dying off is done in a very methodical manner so that none of the toxic or potentially harmful substances are leaked out from the cell, to be engulfed by a large cell and recycled instead.? ?
Any deviation from this normal mechanisms causes disease. But there have been instances where this deviation has contributed to the advancement of modern medicine too. HeLa cells is one such example. HeLa is a cell line obtained from a cancer in the neck of the womb of a lady named Henrietta Lacks in 1951. These cells were obtained without her permission and she eventually succumbed to the same cancer. Even though the origin of the cell line was tragic, it has contributed immensely to the development of medicine. The important of HeLa cells is that due to an abnormality in the said ?normal mechanism?, these cells can be made to replicate indefinitely inside a laboratory. That means non-depleting supply of genetically similar cells for the scientists to work on. It was once estimated that if the HeLa cells which were replicated and distributed worldwide are piled together, it would sum up to 50 million metric tons. These cells have contributed to many advancements in the fields of virology, vaccination and in mapping the human genome. May be going against the rules can be a good thing, in certain Situations after all. What do you think?? ? ?

Britain and America  on the brink of trade war
	
?
UK, (Daily Mail), 28 September 2017 -? ?
Britain and America are on the brink of a trade war after the UK threatened to end its military contracts with the US aerospace company Boeing.? ?
The US ruling is an embarrassment for Mrs May, who personally lobbied President Donald Trump over the dispute - marked a setback to hopes of a swift UK-US trade deal after Brexit. The threat to 14,000 jobs in Northern Ireland - where Bombardier, a Canadian firm, makes wings for its planes - puts a strain on Mrs May?s Commons power-sharing deal with the Democratic Unionist Party.? ?
Last night she said she was ?bitterly disappointed? by the US decision, which it is feared will kill off the C-Series programme.? ?
British Prime Minster Theresa May condemned Boeing after the dispute with Canadian firm Bombardier threatened the loss of thousands of jobs in the UK.? ?
The Ministry of Defence in planning on purchasing 50 Apache AH-64E helicopters and nine P-8 maritime patrol aircraft - which are built by Boeing - from the US government.? ?
The MoD already uses around 60 Chinook helicopters.However, the US giant could simply ?turn off? Britain?s attack helicopters and military transport aircraft, according to an army expert.? ?
A former four-star officer told The Times: ?Boeing owns the data. You buy the data.? ?
?You rely on the original equipment manufacturer for the key to the data, servicing and upgrades. They can turn the fleet off.???

An extremely lucky dolphin has been photographed miraculously surviving an attack by a killer whale. The deadly predator misses by inches when it strikes with ferocious power at the helpless dolphin - but the would-be meal instead bounces off its mouth.
The speed of the orca's strike sends the bottlenose dolphin flying high into the air, before it dives serenely back into the water.
The incredible images perfectly capture the immense power of the deadly underwater hunter, which made several unsuccessful attempts to catch the dolphin.
These remarkable pictures were taken off the coast of Baja in California. (Daily Mail)

Dizzing Bends In Expressway Projects
	
Having an expressway in the past seemed like mission impossible for Sri Lankans, but it was achieved when the E01 Southern Expressway was opened to the public in 2011 under the previous Government.??
In 2014 the extension of the Southern Expressway (ESEP) from Matara to Hambantota- including the expressway link to Mattala (96km)- was proposed by the then Government. However, the construction work of the expressway was halted following a change in Government.??
?
The committee appointed by the Minister of Highways and Investment Promotion gave the options of immediately suspending the project or continuing with the work in keeping with recommendations made by it. Therefore, work on this project recommenced in July 2015.??
?
The project was launched at an estimated cost of US$1.9 billion or Rs.243 billion. These monies were raised through a loan from The Export?Import Bank of China (EXIM Bank) with the Government agreeing to bear 15 per cent of the cost of the first and the second phases.??
?
The 96km long four lane Expressway split into four sections: Matara ? Beliatta (30km), Beliatta ?Wetiya (26km), Wetiya ? Andarawewa (15km) and Mattala ? Hambantota via Andarawewa (25km). The expressway section from Matara to Beliatta (Ch.0+000 ? Ch.30+000) is under the Extension of Southern Expressway Section 1. The Daily Mirror learns that 35 to 40 percent of the project has been completed.??
?
The contract for constructing section 1 Matara ? Beliatta (30km) had been awarded to China National Aero Technology International Engineering Corporation (CATIC) for Rs 103,280mn.??
?
Both contracts of section 2 from Beliatta to Wetiya (26km) and section 3 from Wetiya to Andarawewa (15km) had been awarded to China State Construction Engineering Corporation for Rs 55,200mn and Rs 31,575mn respectively.??
?
The contract for section 4 from Mattala to Hambantota via Andarawewa (25km) had been awarded to China Harbour Engineering Company for Rs 52,156mn.??
?
The present Government, after assuming power, was critical of the development projects of the past regime and claimed that they (the projects) had burdened the country with huge debts. The present regime vowed that the ?Port City? and other such projects, which were termed as white elephants, would be stopped. However, work in these projects has continued.??

The contract for section 4 from Mattala to Hambantota via Andarawewa (25km) had been awarded to China Harbour Engineering Company for Rs 52,156mn.??
Feasibility and technical studies
There have been questions raised as to whether a proper feasibility study had been done before the project was commenced.??
RDA Chairman N.R.Suriyaarachchi said that there was a feasibility study done by some other institute as directed by the RDA and that he had seen it somewhere. But the RDA chairman failed to name this institute. However Suriyaarachchi said that the RDA takes the responsibility regarding the feasibility study.?
?
Meanwhile, by issuing a press release on September 27 (Wednesday), Suriyaarachchi said that the construction work was being carried out following studies made by engineers, environmentalists, surveyors, scientists and technicians attached to the RDA, Ministry of Highways, the Central Environmental Authority and the Departments of Land Reclamation and Geology.? ?
?The officials are highly reputed public servants and veterans in their chosen fields of study. They had taken into consideration the weather patterns, flood situations and other natural disasters when compiling their report,? Suriyaarachchi said.
? ?
He said that the RDA would implement the project based on a optimum cost system on the instructions of the Ministry of Highways.?
?
Suriyaarachchi said that some people with little or no knowledge of the subject of highways were attempting to mislead the people through disinformation.
? ?
The Dailymirror learned during an interview with Suriyaarachchi that a feasibility study had been done at an affordable price since detailed studies cost immensely.??
?When it comes to certain detailed studies the RDA can?t bear high costs. Therefore those studies were carried out in the best way possible by a separate institution on behalf of us,? he said.??
Meanwhile, quoting the technical audit study, carried out by the Moratuwa University, the committee?s ?Review of the Highway Project?s Final Report,? issued on April 28, 2015, had stated the audit report had recommended the immediate suspension of the ESEP.??
?The report suggests the project should at best be implemented as a two lane highway. The Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) at the project cost is reported to be negative (-11.1%),? the university stated in its Technical Audit Report.??
Responding to the matter, the RDA Chairman said that other than the economic viability of the project many other factors have to be considered as well.??
The review report stated not to abandon the project, but implement it at a reduced scope.??
??Construction underway in keeping with standards??- RDA Chairman N.R.Suriyaarachchi??
?Journalists should visit the site and report on the development of the project. The RDA guarantees that the construction is underway in keeping with standards. I assure that so far there have been no misconduct. We were a party when constructing the Victoria Tunnel, Kothmale Tunnel and many more. Not a single project went wrong. We have done the construction based on the latest technology. Viaducts were not used in expressways before. Therefore before questions are raised regarding the project the physical work should be monitored. I invite all journalists to visit the project and witness the physical progress,? said Suriyaarachchi.?
The committee had also identified that the 30 km stretch of the Matara to Beliatta section is on a viaduct running through Kiralakele flood plain and suggested to continue the expressway in the form of four lanes. But the committee had recommended to reduce the proposed width to 22 metres. The committee had made this recommendation because it wasn?t safe to provide a two lane elevated road for a low traffic volume section.??
Possible financial savings
Apart from the issues associated with the design of the ESEP it is learned that the review committee had suggested ways to possibly make a financial saving amounting around Rs.126 billion.??
The report had pointed out that the CATIC (contractor) had made a bid for Rs 103,280mn regarding section 1 on September 20, 2013. The bidder was awarded the contract on October 31, 2013. The report indicates that the project speculations are similar to that of STDP (south section), which runs from Pinnaduwa to Godagama. Therefore concerns had been raised regarding the rates of the contract with recommendations for suitable adjustments for inflation. This was to be done using ICTAD indices and could have been used for Matara to Beliatta section when the evaluation process took place. According to the rate at which the business was confirmed the contract price amounts to Rs 73,892,194,605 which indicates that the contractor?s bid was 40% more than rate specified by STDP.??
??Inquiry should be based on Auditor General?s report??- Kiriella??
?The matter was raised by Handunnetti and he was playing a political game by trying to find any misconduct thereby gaining advantage by accusing the Government. Over the years parliamentarians were sleeping and raised no objections regarding any subject under the past regime,? charged Minister Kiriella.??
?If the COPE needs to inquire into any subject it should be based on an Auditor General?s report. However, Handunnetti had decided who is guilty before the judgment. So far during the Unity Government?s two year period the Auditor General hasn?t questioned the RDA nor the ministry?s mega projects. I?m ready to answer any query made by the Auditor General with regard to the subject, but not to Handunnetti. What is Handunnetti?s qualification to question the work of my authority. My officials nor I will answer amateurs. The Speaker of the House advised? Hadunnetti not to mention his personnel opinions in Parliament. He instructed him not to have any press conferences regarding the matter.??
?COPE is not the police or the CID. What its responsibility is to forward questions based on Auditor General?s Report Queries. So far the Auditor General hasn?t forwarded any observations. It means he doesn?t have any doubts regarding our work as it is transparent.??
My officials and I will respond if Handunnetti brings the Audit Reports. We won?t comment on baseless accusations,?said Kiriella.?
?
Apart from section 1, the committee had recommended that it could have saved Rs 123 billion from sections 2, 3 and 4 if they were built as proposed; in two lanes.?
?
Under the proposed two lane facility, including the service roads, the cost of section 2 would be around Rs 7,800mn. This proposal would have saved Rs 47bn.?
?
The report urged that the same two lane facility could have been implemented in section 3 and 4 at a cost of around Rs 4,500mn and Rs 2,700mn respectively. This scheme would have ensured a saving of Rs 27bn and Rs 49bn respectively. Overall there would have been a grand saving of Rs123bn from the entire project.??
Also COPE Chairman Sunil Handunnetti told at a recent press briefing that the RDA official?s decisions had given rise to a loss in the suggested saving as it disregarded the committee?s review report. ?If their eyes and ears were open it would have not been impossible to make this saving,? he said.?
?Doubts of international consultants
Also MP Handunnetti charged that the Road Development Authority (RDA) hadn?t screened the expatriates regarding their qualifications or experience when their services were obtained from the Republic of China.??
?Employees appointments had been approved placing the entire trust on the contractor. This was done at the risk of the quality and durability of the project,? he said.?
?
According to the ESEP agreement the international consultants should have some experience on the subject. The agreement states that all personnel employed shall have relevant experience connected to expressways.??
While rejecting the claims the RDA Chairman said that the Chinese employees were interviewed using video conference facility.??
However no assessment has been conducted other than merely referring to their CVs according to a letter sent on September 4, 2015. The RDA Project Director R.M Gamini had approved nine individuals under International Consultants where he stated, ?Approval hereby granted to the personnel listed below based on the respective CVs submitted?.??
Also local employees had expressed their displeasure over the differences in salary and complained that the package paid to expatriates exceeded the recommended and standard rates applicable in the field.??
It was found that the difference in the salary was 1:5 when the pay of a local expert was compared with that of an expatriate.??
According to appendix E (services provided by the client) a team leader of the section 2 received a minimum of Rs 4mn (31,000USD) per month while a local team leader was paid only Rs 663,000 per month. Also a foreign Resident Engineer was paid Rs. 3.6mn (28,000USD) while a local Resident Engineer received only Rs 545,500.??
The RDA Chairman said that the salary varies depending on the nationality of the employee. He went on to state that an expatriate received minimum of three times the pay paid to a local. He added that the responsibility of paying salaries rests with the contractor and not the RDA.??

?The consultancy service for design review and construction supervision for civil works on ESEP had been awarded to the China Railway First Survey and Design Institute Group Co. Ltd (FSDI) on December 3, 2014 at a cost of Rs 11.9 billion. It was revealed that no loan agreement was signed with EXIM Bank for the consultancy services.? Commenting on FSDI operation, Handunnetti said FSDI?s role raises suspicion especially as it had failed earlier in identifying that the viaduct length should be increased from 6.33 km to 9.11km and therefore raising the construction cost. Even though in a situation that the agreement was sealed off, on behalf of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management, Secretary to the Prime Minister T.B. Ekanayake in a letter on November 13, 2016 to Ministry of Highways Secretary permitted to extend the viaduct length as required.??
The letter stated that the changes to the scope should be accommodated within the current loan amount by the company. However, it had been later approved.??
According to the original BOQ, the cost for 6.33km was Rs 103,280,000,000 and the FSDI forecast amount for extending it to 9.11km was Rs 126,148,847,447.46.??
?A loss of around Rs 23 million was incurred by the decision,? said Handunnetti.? However, responding to the matter Suriyaarachchi said that during the past Government the E01Expressway had been constructed without a single viaduct apart from the bridges. He said that in the ESEP the RDA had considered the flood plain in the area and identified the necessity of it.??
Meanwhile, Handunnetti charged that the FSDI had violated the country?s emigration and immigration laws when hiring expatriates for the project.??
Quoting a letter sent on October 07, 2016 by FSDI General Manager of International Business Division Hang Dong, he said the FSDI had requested permission from R. Paskaralingam, the Senior Advisor to the Prime Minister, to avoid the non-recognition and invalid metering of the expatriates possessing visit visas.? The letter states, ?In consideration of the client?s urgent requirement and onsite work in progress, FSDI had no choice, but to apply for visit visas or business visas for our engineers to come to Sri Lanka and commence onsite work immediately?.? According to the letter no branch office was setup in Sri Lanka at the time when construction of ESEP commenced and the Department of Immigration and Emigration had delayed granting residence visas to these expatriates.? There was no mention of Paskaralingam having granted approval or having replied to the letter, but the RDA Chairman said that the directives for the approval were given by the officers? committee which functions under Paskaralingam.??
However, he said that the RDA hadn?t authorized any payment for those who possessed visit visas. He also said that matters regarding such projects should be handled in a sensitive manner as Government to Government (G to G) contracts have been signed. He said that with regard to the ESEP such matters were taken care of by the Special Assignments Ministry, which was under Minister Sarath Amunugama.??
Manpower
Also it was reported that several local experts based in foreign countries had shown interest to join the consultancy services, but weren?t given the green light. Some of the local experts who were invited by the RDA had later turned down the invitation due to several incidents being exposed by the media.??
MP Handunnetti on several occasions criticized the behaviour of CATIC and RDA officials and said less qualified and less experienced persons had been appointed to the project while qualified (B.Sc) engineers were overlooked. He also said that some local engineers resigned from the project due to alleged malpractices taking place at the project.??
It was revealed that 15 local employees, who were working on the project, had reported to the RDA Project Director M.S. Nilawfer of the misconduct of a foreign team leader.? A letter signed and dated April 03, 2017 and forwarded by the employees had called for an investigation. These employees have also requested in the letter that suitable action be taken against the team leader regarding 14 incidents of misdeeds carried out by him.??
According to the letter the contractor?s attention had been drawn towards suspicious material used in the project. But the team leader had refused to probe the matter.? Meanwhile, local engineers said that several failures had been reported in an ongoing construction.? ?
Reportedly cracks were surfacing in a ?T-girder? (support beam of the flyovers) giving rise to the fear of a collapsing of the whole flyover, even before construction completes.? MP Handunnetti revealed that the contractor had attempted to repair the failures on the sly and that the local consultants were restricted in their? observations and in their attempts to enter the mentioned areas. It is also said that they were threatened by the team leader when they were attempting to gain access to the site.??
?No action has been taken regarding the mentioned team leader?s decisions nor regarding the contractor in connection with the local consultant staff who had resigned from their portfolios,? MP Handunnetti said.? Also the service of the two complainants D.D.J.A. Amarasena (Quantity Surveyor) and W. Hasantha Fonseka (Geotechnicle Engineer) had been terminated without the RDA?s consent by the consultancy company. The Senior Geotechnical Engineer Dr. N H Priyankara stepped-down from his position with effect from July 05, 2017 after the local engineers exposed the misconducts that happened at the ESEP.?
When inquired the RDA Chairman said that the employees were bound by their sub-contractor who works under the main contractor. He said that therefore the RDA doesn?t hold any responsibility regarding them. However, he said that the RDA would investigate into the misconducts? mentioned in the letter.??
Tax concessions and imports
In a letter dated 13.07.2015 by the Director General of the Department Of Fiscal Policies to the Director General of the Inland Revenue had given instructions regarding the tax concessions granted on the ESEP.??
It indicates that the importation of steel and passenger transport vehicles is exempted from the tax concessions.??
Clause 04 (ii) -- ?Steel is treated as an item which is in the negative list. Therefore, importation of steel is not exempted from taxes. However, the local purchase of steel is eligible for SVAT facility and exemption from NBT, if purchased for a strategic Development Project,???
Clause 05 (ii) ? ?Tax exemptions/ deferments are not entitled for the importation of any vehicles used for passenger transportation,? the letter further said.??
Even though it had been clearly stated that the passenger vehicles weren?t exempted from tax the CATIC (constructor) had requested a duty wavier for the import of a Mercedes Benz. CATIC had mentioned that the vehicle was for the project via a letter sent to the RDA Senior Project Director R.M Gamini on November 21. 2016.??
?Hereby the contractor would like to inform employer that one unit Mercedes Benz Vehicle has been imported by Contractor for the purpose of project use and will arrive at Colombo Port on November 21.2016,? the letter said.?
?
However, following media exposure, the vehicle was released to CATIC after paying the due duties. But it was learned that the company can?t purchase any vehicle under its name as per the agreement. According to the agreed terms whatever vehicle used in the project should be purchased under the state authority and should be handed over once the project is completed.? It was also stated that the tax regarding some spine piles (under B/L no YD1702TJCO17) has been waived off on approval of the RDA despite it being clearly stated that tax exemptions/deferments aren?t entitled when importing steel.? Responding to the matter the RDA Chairman said that the subject doesn?t come under his purview.??
Meanwhile, heated arguments had ensued between Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella and COPE Chairman Handunnetti in Parliament, regarding the matter.? MP Handunnetti questioned the minister over several matters connected with the project, but the minister refused to respond. Minister Kiriella claimed that he nor his officials would comment on the matter unless COPE questions are based on an Auditor General?s report.??

EY discusses SLFRS 9, 15, 16 implementation issues in Sri Lanka
	
?
Ernst & Young (EY) Sri Lanka hosted its clients to a forum on sharing insights on the practical implementation of new Sri Lanka Accounting Standards.
SLFRS 9 ? Financial Instruments and SLFRS 15 ? Revenue from Contracts will come into effect January 1, 2018 and SLFRS 16 ? Leases will come into effect?
January 1, 2019.?
The event was attended by audit committee chairpersons, CEOs and CFOs of companies in Sri Lanka. The local leadership of the firm and two area leaders from Singapore ? J.A. Chiang and the Philippines ? Aris Malantic addressed?
the gathering.?
EY Sri Lanka Country Managing Partner Ruwan Fernando welcomed the invitees, highlighting the need for discussion on practical experience at a time when companies are just three months away from implementing two critical standards, SLFRS 9?
and SLFRS 15.?
The banks are at a crucial stage in their SLFRS 9 implementation process. There is no shortage of challenges facing senior management as they work towards balancing the cross functional ownership of the programme whilst delivering across risk, finance, business and technology functions.?
EY Sri Lankan Practice Assurance Leader Manil Jayesinghe said, ?Under SLFRS 9, the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses on the balance sheet is intended to reflect the pattern of credit deterioration or improvement over the life of the instrument through the designation of a stage. Instruments that have not exhibited significant deterioration are designated as Stage 1. A 12-month expected credit loss is recorded on these instruments.?
Where there has been significant deterioration in creditor, an incurred credit loss, the instrument is reported as Stage 2 and 3, respectively, with lifetime expected losses reported. The new model for impairment is likely to increase provisions of banks and finance companies. The increase in provisions will have a direct impact on the Tier I ratios under Basel III,? he warned.
The forum also highlighted that SLFRS 16, the new leasing standard, would bring about a ?right of use asset? on the balance sheets of lessees that may further erode capital, if they were considered as risk-weighted assets.
EY ASEAN Financial Accounting Advisory Services (FAAS) Partner Aris Malantic shared his experience in implementing the new standard in major banks in the Philippines. He noted that the executive level sponsors, who take responsibility for the overall project implementation, including maintaining an integrated communication channel across risk, finance, business and technology, are a key success factor in the implementation process. Cohesive and detailed implementation plans that are underpinned by well-structured work streams with defined roles and responsibilities will support the governance of?the project.?
?Financial statements depict the story of the actions of the business. The collaboration with business cannot be overemphasized in the implementation of SLFRS 9, as this will support the sustainability of the project in the long run,? he said.
Financial Accounting Advisory Services Asia-Pac Leader J.A. Chiang highlighted to the audience that SLFRS 16 ? Leases will require most lessees to recognize a right of use asset on the balance sheet. The effort in identifying leases in organisations and capturing data requires changes to current processes and controls.
Addressing a gathering of audit committee members and CFOs of listed and specified business entities (SBE) in Sri Lanka, the EY team shared their experience in implementing SLFRS 15 ? Revenue from Contracts. The core principle of the standard is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Although the principle in the standard is logical, application of the standard is extremely complex.
Manil said, ?Our businesses are used to recording revenue based on the invoice value. The new standard requires you to start recognising revenue based on the contract with the customer. This will cause tremendous pressure on the data capturing ability of the?
current processes.?
Financial Accounting Advisory Services Sri Lanka Partner Hiranthi Fonseka shared the experience of EY Sri Lanka in terms of adopting the standard. Many industries such as FMCG, telecom, manufacturing, tourism, etc. will have its revenue impacted, where third parties are involved in distributing goods and services to the end consumer.?
The determination of principle and agent is more clarified in the new standard and entities are compelled to establish transfer of control if the current practice of revenue recognition is to continue.?
Some of the other industries that have challenges in terms of revenue recognition would be the IT sector, real estate sector and services sector.?
?Certain industries may be severely affected and others not so but every company will have to go through the process of evaluation of its contracts under the new principles,? concluded Aris.

For Hugh Hefner, gay rights were part of the sexual revolution
	
?
By ?? Derek Hawkins?
Hefner, who died Wednesday at 91, prided himself as an advocate for the? LGBT community, taking public stands on high-profile issues such as? sodomy laws, same-sex marriage and transgender rights well into his? later years.? The anecdote about ?The Crooked Man? was little known until? 2009 when it was highlighted in ?Hugh Hefner: Playboy, Activist and? Rebel,? a documentary on Hefner?s civil rights advocacy.?
The year was 1955, and science fiction author Charles Beaumont had, by most accounts, crossed the line with his latest short story.??
?The Crooked Man? depicted a dystopian future where homosexuality was the norm and heterosexuals were persecuted minorities. Even the relatively progressive Esquire magazine had rejected the piece because it was too controversial.??
But Beaumont found a fan in a young Hugh Hefner, who agreed to run it in his Playboy magazine, then less than two years old.??
Outraged letters poured in to Playboy. Even readers of the pioneering nude publication found Beaumont?s tale of straight people dressing in drag and sneaking into dark barrooms to find partners too offensive for their tastes.??
Hefner responded to the backlash in a defiant note. ?If it was wrong to persecute heterosexuals in a homosexual society,? he wrote, ?then the reverse was wrong, too.???
The move would serve to represent an early example of Hefner?s lifelong commitment to gay rights, and civil rights in general.

According to Dr.Abeysinghe the pancreas and the two kidneys of the deceased youth were also removed and secured for future transplant operations of three other patients.? ?
The youth whose organs were secured after his demise was Nalin Bandara Sakalasuriya (28), a bachelor from Kapuliyadda, Thalathuoya.??
Nalin Bandara (Whose heart was used for the transplant operation)
The first heart transplant surgery was performed on 07 July at the Kandy Hospital. Both these operations were performed by a team of doctors led by Cardiothoracic Specialist Dr. Anil Abewickrema of the Kandy Hospital.? ?
Sewwandi?s heart functioned only ten percent. When she was subjected to diagnosis the doctors decided that only a heart transplant could save her life.??
Sachini?s family has had a history of heart disease. Her elder sister died of a heart disease about five years ago.??
On an earlier occasion Sachini was scheduled to undergo surgery for a heart transplant where the heart was to be obtained from an army officer who was proclaimed to be brain dead. However, since it was a controversial issue plans for the operation were shelved.??

? I retired from the police about 12 years ago. I have four sons and two daughters. My son Nalin Bandara met with an accident while riding his motorcycle and was receiving medical treatment at the neuro intensive care unit of the Kandy General Hospital. Doctors told me it wasn?t possible for him to live as his brain was dead. They asked about my willingness to donate the important organs of my son to use in transplant surgeries. All my family members and I conveyed our willingness to donate our son?s organs. Now we are happy as four others are fortunate to live due to this donation. It is some consolation for our sadness,? said Senevirathna.??
?He also appealed to the people to donate the organs of persons who are proclaimed brain dead so as to help other patients survive. He said that those who do so will be be blessed and receive merits.

## Title: How to treat Tennis Elbow
## Section: Medicine

How to treat Tennis Elbow
	
?
You may have come across people who suffer from elbow pain. Some have symptoms without any trigger, where the elbow becomes swollen and painful spontaneously. In others it happens after strenuous activity or sports. Tennis Elbow and Golfer?s Elbow are terms given to categorize activity related to elbow pain. And these two conditions do not necessarily mean that you need to play tennis or golf before? symptoms are noted. You might not know that Tennis Elbow was earlier described as Writer?s Cramp in 19th century. Later on as the Washer Women?s Elbow! Finally, Henry Morris a British surgeon termed this condition as ?Lawn Tennis Arm? in 1883.??
?
Structure of the elbow
The elbow is a complicated joint. There are basically two different types of movement possible within this joint. You can bend and straighten the elbow. Then you can rotate the forearm (this happens from within the elbow) so that the palm of hand is either up or down. The latter movement is called pronation and supination. All this complexity is the gift from evolution to aid us in using the most advanced tool of all ? our hand. So actually the elbow is a large joint which holds the human hand steady and aids it in various maneuvers.??
?
A classification of pain
Elbow pain can be simply classified in to two different types. Pain generating from within the joint, which is sometimes associated with a bit of swelling and redness of skin. And pain arising from the structures that surround the joint.??
And when the time of occurrence is considered, we classify pain again into three different types. The early morning pain and stiffness of the elbow, which could be inflammatory arthritis related. The ?At the end of the day? elbow pain which is probably osteoarthritis related. And the third category is the ?Aftermath of injury/ playing sports? pain. The latter is how usually golfer?s or tennis elbow happens.??
?
Pain arising from structures that surround the elbow
There are two groups of muscles which commence at the elbow level and end up at the hand. These two muscle groups move the forearm, wrist and fingers. The muscle bundle at the outer aspect of the forearm mainly helps the fingers and wrist to straighten out. The muscles at the inner aspect of forearm help the wrist and fingers to bend. These muscles are attached to bony hills named epicondyles.? When there is pain over the outer epicondyle, the term tennis elbow is given. When the pain is felt over the inner aspect epicondyle, its called golfer?s elbow.??
?
Carpenters
Tennis elbow isn?t confined to tennis players. It is seen in people who use heavy tools like the hammer. Swinging movements of the forearm done by carpenters or other professionals can injure the area surrounding the outer (lateral) epicondyle. This is an area where a bundle of forearm muscles unite and tightly fit in to the bone.??
Movements which involve fist clenching and straightening out the wrist can worsen the Tennis Elbow. This condition is also given the complex term lateral epicondylitis.??
?
Baseball players
Golfers elbow is also named pitcher?s elbow. This condition is seen in baseball pitchers who throw the ball. Pain is felt at the inner aspect of the elbow where muscles unite at a bony prominence called the medial epicondyle. Rotating/twisting the forearm or bending the wrist can worsen the symptoms.??
?
Pain coming from within the elbow joint
The elbow is a place where three arm bones unite. There is a joint cavity which has a bit of fluid in it. And several structures like ligaments, muscles and tendons to keep the joint steady. Certain blood vessels and nerves surround the joint as well.??
?The joint swells up in a process called inflammatory arthritis. Inflammatory arthritis in turn can develop in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthritis. The symptoms are worse in the morning. Pain and stiffness cause severe agony. As the day progresses the symptoms might subside. In very severe inflammatory arthritis the movements in the elbow joint are restricted; patient complains of inability to completely bend or straighten out the elbow. If this continues there will be visible deformities of the elbow.??
In osteoarthritis pain and stiffness can develop at any time of the day. But this is worse after prolonged periods of rest. And also at the end of the day. Osteoarthritis isn?t just a disease of the elderly. Unlike what we earlier thought osteoarthritis isn?t purely a wear and tear process of the joint.??
Both inflammatory and osteoarthritis can cause clicking or creaky elbow.?
?
Treatment?
A proper evaluation by a consultant is needed before commencing any treatment. As there are a variety of conditions that could mimic these symptoms.??
A period of rest from strenuous activity involving the elbow is advised. Patients should be taught elbow protection strategies. Advice on how to carry weights is provided. A tennis elbow band is helpful. This is an orthotic device which is worn over the forearm to prevent muscle tension acting over the injury area. And also a wrist brace which holds the wrist in slightly straightened out posture is helpful as well. The wrist brace again reduces the strain over lateral epicondyle.??
Physiotherapy methods like ultrasound therapy and heat therapy might help. We also prescribe drugs such as NSAIDS and steroids. In resistant cases steroid injections are administered.??
?
How pain is evaluated
As mentioned earlier features of inflammatory(swollen) arthritis should be differentiated from osteoarthritis.?
The patient is usually evaluated for all the difficulties faced when moving about the joint. If you imagine, even the simple process of eating involves picking up food from the plate, then bending the elbow while rotating the hand/forearm to eat. After obtaining details investigations such as X rays and blood tests are done.??
Treatment for inflammatory arthritis is a combination of disease modifying drugs, proper physiotherapy and in certain instances injections.?
In osteoarthritis disease modifying drugs have no place. Pain relief, physio and joint injections are helpful.??

## Title: Ideal female partner for marital happiness

Ideal female partner for marital happiness
	
?
?
Marriage assumes such unique significance, a successful marriage is considered a synonym for the success in life.? We all know either through experience or acquired intimate knowledge, failure in marriage means a great failure in life.?
?
Success in marriage depends more on woman
There is a belief in Sri Lankan society that the success of marriage depends more on the woman than on the man.? One may argue that this statement is a fallacy and both wife and husband are equally responsible for the success or the failure of marriage.?
However, due to the common belief that the qualities and the character of the female partner greatly account for the success or the failure of a marriage, the Buddhists and the Hindus in particular have come to attach great significance to obtaining a reading of the horoscope of the bride-to-be to ascertain whether she would make a virtuous and devoted wife.
What ancient rishis and Vedic astrologers have said about women in their great works has lent strength to the belief that the female partner is greatly responsible for making a marriage a success or a failure.? For example, ancient Indian Maharishis have said that marriage to a virtuous woman would nullify all Arishta yogas her husband is subject to.?
?
Principles of Female Horoscopy
According to principles guiding Female Horoscopy, a woman is very fortunate if Moon and Jupiter as well as Mars and Venus are strongly posited in her horoscope. It is equally important to have the 2nd, 3rd, 5th and the 9th Houses free from malefic influences. Of course, it goes without saying that the Lagna, above everything must be strong. The best planet to occupy the Lagna of a female is the Moon.?
If there are benefic planets in the 2nd House and the lord of the 2nd house is either associated with benefics or aspected by benefics, the woman would lead a very happy life after marriage.
?
Kama Triangle factor?
The 3rd House of the Kama Triangle in the Natal Chart too is an important factor where marriage is concerned. A benefic posited in the 3rd House aspecting the 7th House is very favourable.? If the 3rd House is ruled by a malefic and is occupied by another malefic and aspected by other malefics while the 2nd lord is associated with malefics, husband would not live long. If the 11th House is also affected in a similar manner while the 2nd is also afflicted, a similar fate would befall the husband.?
?
Significant planetary positions
Malefics in the 7th House and the lord of the 7th House associated with malefics would delay the marriage. If either Jupiter or Venus aspects a strongly posited Mars occupying the 7th House, the female would be a voluptuous beauty who would marry a powerful person occupying a position of authority. If an afflicted Mars or a weak Mars in the 7th House is aspected by a malefic, marriage would either break up or would be plagued by constant quarrels between wife and husband.? It is an important astrological principle, if Rahu is posited in the 7th House of a sign whose Navamsa is owned by Saturn in the Natal Chart of a female, both her husband and children would come to a tragic end. A girl would grow up into a charming and beautiful woman if the Moon is exalted in her horoscope. An exalted Moon in the 7th House signifies a successful marriage.
?
Strong Mars and Venus for early marriage -? Moon and Jupiter for success in marriage
It is Mars and Venus who are responsible for bringing about an early marriage. The role of Jupiter and the Moon is to ensure that the marriage is a success.? Saturn and Ketu would delay the marriage. Rahu and the Sun would either delay or quicken the marriage falling in line with the stronger one of the Mars ? Venus and Saturn - Ketu combinations.? Marriage is hastened when Saturn aspects Mars.
?
No marriage if Saturn aspects both Moon and Venus
A female with Saturn aspecting both Venus and the Moon in her horoscope would show no interest in marriage.?
The most important House in a horoscope be it of a male or a female, is the 9th House or Punyasthana.? Slow moving planets like Jupiter and Saturn lead to yogas that delay marriage.? Saturn aspecting Venus who is posited in a sign owned by the former would definitely delay marriage.? However, if Saturn aspects Mars from wherever he is, marriage is hastened.?
Veteran astrologers say that if Saturn aspects the Moon from the 9th House marriage gets delayed. Jupiter in the 9th House would stall marriage, but when it happens it would be a great success.? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

## Title: Importance of Cardiac Rehabilitation
## Section: Medicine
## Date: 29 September 2017 02:19 pm
Importance of Cardiac Rehabilitation
	
Heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women. More than half of the deaths due to heart disease relate to men.?
According to the World Health Organization statistics 23% of women and 18% of men will die within one year of a first recognized heart attack. 22-32% of women and 15-27% of men who survive heart attacks will die within five years.??
12-25% of women and 7-22% of men who survive heart attacks will be diagnosed with heart failure within five years.??
Women are less likely than men to receive appropriate treatment after a heart attack. Cardiac rehabilitation is a medically supervised program for people who have had a heart attack, heart failure, heart valve surgery, coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary intervention. Cardiac rehab involves adopting heart-healthy lifestyle changes to address risk factors for cardiovascular disease. To help you adopt lifestyle changes, this program includes physical training, education on heart-healthy living, and counseling to reduce stress. These measures will help you return to an active life. Cardiac rehab can improve your health and quality of life, reduce the need for medicine that treats heart or chest pain, reduce the chance of you returning to hospital or an emergency room for a heart problem, prevent future heart problems and even help you live longer.??
The cardiac rehab team comprises doctors, physical and occupational therapists, nurses, exercise specialists, dietitians or nutritionists, and mental health specialists. Sometimes a case manager will help track your health issues. Your cardiac rehab team will design a program to meet your needs. Before starting your programme, the rehab team will take your medical history, do a physical exam and perform tests. Possible tests include an electrocardiogram (EKG), cardiac imaging tests and a treadmill or stationary bike exercise test. You also may have tests to measure your cholesterol and blood sugar levels. During cardiac rehab, you will learn to exercise safely and increase your physical activity. The length of time that you spend in cardiac rehab depends on your condition. Cardiac rehab can include programmes at home and at rehab facilities. Your rehab team will keep a close watch on how exercise affects your heart and how you are progressing, before gradually releasing you from supervision to continue cardiac rehab on your own. The healthier lifestyle you?ve learned-including eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and not smoking-can then become a way of life for you.??
During this time you may also see your doctor regularly to treat other medical conditions, including high cholesterol and high blood pressure.??
The benefits of cardiac rehabilitation
Strengthening and conditioning of your heart and lungs??
	Controlling weight and improving cholesterol levels, including HDL, LDL, triglycerides and total cholesterol??
	Understanding your medications, the signs and symptoms of heart disease and when to seek medical attention??
	Increasing self-confidence??
	Laying the groundwork for the development of a healthier lifestyle??
	Reducing your symptoms and chances of experiencing another cardiac event??
	Early return to work and activities of daily living??
	Developing healthy habits and stress reduction skills, as well as relaxation techniques??
	Providing emotional support for you and your family??
?
Cardiac Rehabilitation Through Education
This education will help you understand heart condition and ways in which to reduce the risk for you having future heart problems. The rehabilitation team will help you develop a realistic plan to identify and reduce heart disease risk factors. You will participate in nutrition and stress management sessions. The more you know about what contributes and leads to the development of heart disease and the steps you can take toward building a healthier heart, the more you can help reduce your risk of developing a cardiovascular condition. Learning stress-reduction techniques, ways to eat healthy and making other behavioleral changes can also help you prevent future problems.? The heart-healthy lifestyle changes in cardiac rehab have few risks. Very rarely, physical activity during rehab can cause serious problems, such as injuries to your muscles and bones, or possibly life-threatening heart rhythm problems. If serious problems occur during the supervised sessions, the rehab team will immediately stop the physical activity, administer appropriate treatment and contact your cardiologist??
Heart-healthy eating??
Heart-healthy eating involves consuming vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fat-free or low-fat dairy products, fish, lean meats, poultry, eggs, nuts, seeds, soy products, legumes and vegetable oils (except coconut and palm oils). Also, it limits sodium, saturated and Tran?s fats, added sugars and alcohol.?
?
?
Food to eat??
The following foods are the foundation of a heart-healthy diet.??
?
Vegetables such as greens (spinach, collard greens, kale), broccoli, cabbage, and carrots??
	Fruits such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, grapes, and prunes??
	Whole grains such as plain oatmeal, brown rice, and whole-grain bread or tortillas??
	Fat-free or low-fat dairy foods such as milk, cheese, or yogurt??
Protein-rich foods:??
Fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, trout, about 8 ounces a week??
	Lean meats such as 95 percent lean ground beef or pork tenderloin??
	Poultry such as skinless chicken??
	Eggs??
	Nuts, seeds, and soy products??
	Legumes such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans??
	Oils and foods containing high levels of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats that can help lower blood cholesterol levels and the risk of cardiovascular disease.?
?
Some sources of these oils are:??
Canola, corn, olive, safflower, sesame, sunflower, and soybean oils??
	Nuts such as walnuts, almonds, and pine nuts??
	Nut and seed butters??
	Salmon and trout??
	Seeds such as sesame, sunflower, pumpkin, or flax Avocados??
?
Smoking increases the risk
Smoking increases the risk of coronary heart disease by itself. When it acts with other factors, it greatly increases risk. Smoking increases blood pressure, decreases exercise tolerance and increases the tendency for the blood to clot. Smoking also increases the risk of recurrent coronary heart disease after bypass surgery.??
Cigarette smoking is the most important risk factor for young men and women. It produces a greater relative risk in persons under age 50 than in those over 50.??
Women who smoke and use oral contraceptives greatly increase their risk of coronary heart disease and stroke compared with nonsmoking women who use oral contraceptives.??
Smoking decreases HDL (good) cholesterol. Cigarette smoking combined with a family history of heart disease also seems to greatly increase the risk for heart disease. You will thank yourself one day for quitting smoking. The health benefits start almost immediately and within a few years of quitting smoking your risk of stroke and coronary artery disease is similar to those of non-smokers. We can help with resources and tools for the healthiest decision you make to quit smoking.??
?
Physiotherapy and cardiac rehabilitation
The physiotherapist has a central role in the physical and educational components of CR programs. Physiotherapists Prescribe individualized exercise programmes that contribute to the education programs on lifestyle??
Also take a note of the following:?
Changes, such as smoking cessation.??
	CR programs are delivered in public facilities and in the community and home settings.?
	CR Programs, in which a physiotherapist is centrally involved, are highly effective for improving the Individual?s health outcomes.
?
Impact on Patient Experience??
The involvement of the physiotherapist in the delivery of CR programs improves patient compliance and results in better health outcomes for participants.??
?
CR programs can be delivered at home or in a facility and both delivery models are equally effective at improving health outcomes.??
	Physiotherapy in CR provides tailored care that leads to improvements in physical and psychosocial function and high patient satisfaction??
CR programmes that include physiotherapy are an effective low-risk intervention that emphasizes exercise, education and lifestyle modifications. CR increases physical activity in patients following cardiac events and encourages the adoption of healthy behaviours leading to a reduction in the rate of hospitalization, subsequent cardiovascular events and mortality. Physiotherapists support the transition from hospital to on-going community services.?

A teenager who lost both her arms in a horror bus crash has had one of the world?s first double limb transplants.? ?
Shreya Siddanagowda, 19, had to have both her arms amputated above the elbow when they were crushed in the accident.? ?
Amazingly, she was able to crawl to safety, and four months later she started using prosthetics ? which she found limited.? ?
Then, last month the selfless family of a 20-year-old male student, who suffered a fatal head injury in a motorbike crash, agreed to donate his arms.? ?It meant she could have the 13-hour operation, which was the first in Asia ? and one of only ten double upper arm transplants ever carried out in the world.Chemical engineering student Shreya has now been discharged from hospital and is undergoing an intensive physiotherapy and rehabilitation programme.?

Maha Nayaka, Buddhist organization express reservations
	
The Maha Nayaka of the Amarapura Maha Nikaya Venerable Kotugoda Dhammawasa Thera and the Buddha Sasana Karya Sadaaka Mandalaya, a leading Buddhist organization, has opposed certain sections of the Interim Report on the new Constitution that was presented by the steering committee of the Constitutional Assembly recently.
A statement issued by the organization said the report has suggested the inclusion of "Sri Lanka (Ceylon) is a free, sovereign and Independent Republic (aekiya rajya/orumiththa nadu) consisting of the institutions of the Centre and the provinces which shall exercise power as laid down in the Constitution? when defining the nature of State.
However, it said the Tamil word ?orumiththa nadu? means united. The organization said this could be an attempt to achieve federalism. Additionally, it said it was opposed to an alternate section being included in the report on the status of Buddhism in the country.
Accordingly, the organization said it is opposed to the wording that had been included which states that other faiths would not be discriminated against while giving the foremost place to Buddhism. ?It is not clear as to this applies in this situation when other religions are not subjected to discrimination even now".
The statement has been signed by Venerable Maha Nayaka of the Amarapura Maha Nikaya Kotugoda Dhammawasa Thera, Venerable Welihitiyawe Kusaladhamma Thera, Venerable Bellanwila Wimalaratana Thera, President, All Ceylon Buddhist Congress Dr. Praneeth Abeysundara and Jagath Sumathipala along with a host of other monks and laymen.

OBD additives to fasten decomposition of plastics and polythene
	
By Supun Dias?
In the aftermath of the decision by the government to ban the use of polythene lunch sheets, rigifoam boxes and shopping bags, with effect from the beginning of this month, New Nawaloka Trading is introducing oxo-biodegradable (OBD) additives so that they could convert long-life polyolefin plastic bags to degrade after a pre-programmed lifespan of complete mechanical integrity.
Therefore, it is an optimum approach to the environmental pollution and its consequences, according to its manufacturer, EnerPlastics ? a company based in the UAE.?
New Nawaloka Trading CEO V. Ganesh said that the relationship with EnerPlastics is over two decades and the innovative products introduced to the Sri Lankan market have always been recognized by many of their customers over the years.?
EnerPlastics OBD additive masterbatches are introduced to plastic films at the manufacturing stage; the additives are dosed at very low level, which ensures that the commercial product (film) would have a guaranteed mechanical strength and other properties for a minimum period (usually 12 months) after manufacturing.
At an event held at Cinnamon Lakeside Hotel to introduce this product, EnerPlastics Research Specialist Rashad Hasnain said, ?We believe that the timing is very important because this will help our stakeholders to overcome the challenges faced due to the present crisis.? If you take the global record, more than 230 million tonnes of plastic are produced for a year but only 7 percent is recycled out of that. OBD will make sure that the process is faster when it comes to decomposition.??
?If you take the mechanism of polyethylene biodegradation known as oxo-biodegradation, it is involved in two stages. These are: abiotic (photo or thermo) oxidation and microbial biodegradation,? he added.?
?Initial abiotic oxidation is an important stage as it determines the rate of the entire process. In this stage, polyethylene is oxidized leading to reduction of its molecular weight significantly. The main factors that influence abiotic oxidation are heat and sunlight. They are crucial for both reduction of molecular weight and the production of low molecular weight compounds that can be assimilated easily by the microorganisms. The organometallic constituents act as a catalyst in oxidizing the polymer molecule to a state where it is converted as food to soil microbes, fungi, bacteria,? he noted.?
EnerPlastics OBD can be used for all applications in which conventional polyolefins are suitable. EnerPlastics is an excellent one-stop shop with the other colour and additive masterbatches available.? EnerPlastics CEO Akther Aman and EnerPlastics Sales Manager were also present at the event.?

Pumping out awareness on preventing CVD
	
?
Today, September 29 is the world Heart Day. The theme this year is ?share the power?.? ?
Why is a whole day dedicated to a body organ each year? Did you know that cardiovascular diseases remain as the leading cause of death worldwide? More importantly, the World Heart Federation has declared that at least 80% of the premature deaths can be prevented by controlling preventable risk factors. Therefore, Health Capsule consulted Dr. M.R Mubarak, Consultant Cardiologist, National Hospital Sri Lanka, and the Vice president of the Sri Lanka Heart Association to obtain more information about the prevention of heart diseases and his views about World Heart Day.? ?
?
About Cardiovascular Diseases
The heart is the powerhouse of the body, generating enough pressure to pump our lifeblood throughout the body. Therefore, every other organ in the body is dependent on the heart to keep working.? ?
The heart is a pump consisting of two sides; the left and the right. The right side receives the de-oxygenated or ?used? blood in the body and sends it to the lungs for it to be cleared and re-oxygenated. The left heart receives this ?good? blood from the lungs and re-distribute it throughout the body.? ?
The cardiovascular system consists of the heart and the vessels that are transporting the blood from the heart. Therefore Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) also cover heart diseases (Cardio) like heart attacks and sudden cardiac death, and diseases of the vessels (vascular) like stroke, said Dr. Mubarak. He stressed on the Burden of CVD saying that 31% , of all the world?s deaths are due to cardiovascular causes. ?That is almost one third of all deaths worldwide. All the other causes like cancer and road traffic accidents come after CVD,? he explained.? ?
The aim of world Heart Day is to spread awareness among the people about how to prevent CVD, since most of these illnesses can be prevented if we addressed the causative factors in a timely manner.? ?
?
Risk factors
Heart cells, like other cells, need oxygen and nutrients to function. These are supplied by a network of blood vessels surrounding the heart, called coronary arteries. These vessels are obstructed by cholesterol plaques called atheroma which are collected in the wall of blood vessels. The atheromas narrow the blood vessels, obstructing the blood supply to heart muscle. Once these vessels are completely obstructed, they give rise to a heart attack.? ?
?Smoking is the number one risk factor followed by Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension, high blood cholesterol. ?A sedentary lifestyle with a lack of exercise, bad food habits and stress are also risk factors for CVD,? Dr. Mubarak said.? ?
?
Prevention
Now that we know what the risk factors are, how do we prevent a heart attack or a stroke? Smoking cessation is pivotal in preventing a heart attack, according to Dr. Mubarak. Getting the blood sugar levels checked regularly in adults and if diagnosed with diabetes, keeping the blood sugar levels under control is also highly important. This could be achieved through dietary control and through medication.? ?
?If you are above 35 years old, checking your blood pressure and if it is high, taking treatment would go a long way towards the prevention of both strokes and heart attacks,? he added. But what about the young generation? Should they only start thinking about heart attack prevention when they are past 35? That isn?t so. By leading an active lifestyle, with a minimum of 30 minutes of regular exercise at-least five days a week incorporated into their schedule, anyone can start fighting against CVD from a younger age. But it?s not too late to start exercising for the adults too. Having healthy food habits with limited fats and sugars, maintaining your weight to match your height and leading a life with a minimum of stress will also contribute towards the health of your heart.? ?
?
How to recognize a heart attack?
While you are leading a healthy life, it?s good to be always prepared in case of an emergency. This may in turn save your life or the life of your loved one. So we asked the doctor to explain to our readers about the danger signs of a Heart attack.? ?
The main feature of Heart attack is the sudden chest pain associated with other factors like sweating, nausea and vomiting. The pain may be spreading to other nearby areas like the arms the neck or the jaw. The pain is usually felt as a tightening and severe type of chest pain, but may come as more of a burning type of a chest pain. ?If the chest pain comes as a burning type of pain, most people self-diagnose it as gastritis, using whatever home remedies available and delay seeking medical treatment until the last moment. This may give rise to more complications, sometimes even ending up with the death of the patient,? Dr. Mubarak stated.? ?
Therefore it?s of utmost importance that you seek early medical treatment in case of a sudden onset chest pain, no matter whatever the type. Thereafter, the doctor will perform ECG and blood tests, and will decide if you are having a heart attack. ?The importance of seeking early treatment can?t be stressed enough. If you have a sudden onset chest pain, don?t delay until the sun rises or until your work is done.Immediately go to the nearest Out Patient Department or the medical centre,? was the advice Dr. Mubarak gave readers.? ?
?
About World Heart Day
While the whole world is celebrating The World Heart Day, spreading awareness about preventable causes of Heart disease, Sri Lanka Heart Association (SLHA) is also making Sri Lankans aware of the prevention of CVD. ?We have organized a Heart Walk on October 15 commencing from the BMICH premises to spread awareness of the importance of exercise in preventing CVD. Consultants would offer free advise on various other health related topics like dietary and behavioural modifications for a healthy life at the event,? he stated concluding the interview with an invitation to all to be present at the BMICH premises on this day.? ? ?

Reflections on a father, son and a scanner
	
A tribute to those who fight so that others may live.
About a year ago a campaign to raise money to purchase a much-needed machine for a hospital was carried out successfully. It was an attempt to get relevant authorities to be aware of the fact that such a machine was needed for about 100,000 of those living among us suffering from cancer, and 20,000 more who get added to that number every year. I wrote on that, the person who led this campaign, and the ?why? and ?how? behind the person?s motivations. More than a year on, where are we???
Numbers don?t lie. So here are some statistics. In addition to the 100,000 who suffer in the country and the 20,000 who get added, at any given point there are around 300 doctors tending to cancer patients laid down on more than 1,100 beds. Two years ago, of that 20,000 more than 13,000 had been admitted to the Cancer Hospital. In Maharagama. That?s the Hospital the campaign I mentioned above was for. The fact that 65% of our cancer patients resort to it indicates, discernibly, that most of those afflicted with the disease are unable to afford private treatment elsewhere.??
It all began three years ago. A man called M. S. H. Mohomed wanted his son, diagnosed with osteosarcoma, cured. He took his son, Humaid, to a hospital in Chennai. The hospital had facilities and the latest technical expertise, but cost a lot. And so the father spent. Throughout 2014, he sold three of his properties, dug into his pockets, and tried a cure. Nothing worked. He thus brought his son back to Sri Lanka. Humaid was admitted to a private hospital for six months. Again, the bills kept on mounting and nothing happened, despite two surgeries on his lungs. Desperate and against all odds, his father admitted him to the Maharagama Hospital.??
The hospital wasn?t privately owned. For someone like Mohomed, it was kind of a last resort you?d run to when you?d run out of options elsewhere. In other words, a place associated with squalor and lack of quality. For Mohomed, though, a few days and weeks were enough to open his eyes. ?The doctors were kind, the service was excellent, and the nurses were courteous,? he recalled.??
Because of this, he wanted to give back. He wanted to appreciate and to let others know. He picked on a key item the Cancer Hospital lacked; a PET (Positron Emission Topography) Scanner, used to differentiate between malignant and normal tissue when detecting cancer (something the machines that the Hospital already had couldn?t do). The scanner was available at private hospitals, but for better or worse (I prefer not to take sides) they were and continue to be run at a profit. For this reason, tests were expensive. At the very least, getting a scan at one of those hospitals cost about 150,000 rupees, clearly outside the reach of a great many people.??
So Mohomed got to work. He had contacts. He had money. He used both. For the next few months, he drove a campaign which was unparalleled in that it didn?t receive the kind of recognition it should have from officials. People responded. Citizens, be they Sinhala, Muslim, or Tamil, got together. Where the Government failed, the people delivered. They needed to raise 200 million. Hefty, but not impossible.??
To get a PET Scanner requires getting through several barriers. That?s part and parcel of the law, and how it?s institutionalised to ensure that everything involving money, and public causes, is planned for while adhering to both its letter and spirit
Along the way, they got more support. An anonymous donor gave 35 million rupees. A TV station gave airtime and was behind the campaign, proving that the media wasn?t as unethical as the Government claimed. Back when ministers were quibbling over vehicle permits, when the worst floods had come without as much as a proper government salvage operation, the people came out. An organisation was founded by Mohomed, the Kadijah Foundation (named after his mother), to collect funds.??
On June 13 the campaign was over. They?d reached 200 million.??
That campaign wasn?t just for the PET Scanner, by the way. It was also for those other machines like; an MRI Scanner, a CT Scanner, a Genetic Lab, an Endoscope, a Colonoscope, a Bronchoscope, an Ultrasound Scanner, at least two other ambulances, and, finally, hearses for the dead. The Cancer Hospital lacks most of these and what it has are either (as with the CT and Ultrasound Scanners) almost 15 years old or (as with the Endoscope) malfunctioning. As for the cost, Mohomed gave me a figure; more than 800 million rupees. Not an amount to play with, one can argue.??
He wanted to appreciate and to let others know. He picked on a key item the Cancer Hospital lacked; a PET (Positron Emission Topography) Scanner, used to differentiate between malignant and normal tissue when detecting cancer
Mohomed was born in Kalutara. When he came to Colombo in his youth, he had nothing, except a will to survive, to thrive, and to live with his conscience. When he rose up, with a family, and when his business flourished and everything seemed alright, his son, Humaid, complained of a pain in his shoulder. That was when everything really started, including the campaign, and Mohomed, whom I called ?our hero? (the nation?s hero) last year, encountered his conscience. The personal is always greater, and more potent, than the social, which is why in this crisis, and through it, he remembered his boyhood will to wade through thick and thin with that conscience.??
He had contacts. He had money. He used both. For the next few months, he drove a campaign which was unparalleled in that it didn?t receive the kind of recognition it should have from officials
All that congealed last year to a new trust, a new foundation: ?Fight Cancer Trust?. Limited by guarantee. They held seminars, frequently visited government and medical officials, and tried to ensure that the 200 million and the 800 million were not in vain. Of the equipment that the Maharagama Hospital needs, the PET Scanner figures in significantly. Which begs the question: why has it taken so long???
Now getting down a PET Scanner is not easy. There?s work to do. Time to spend. You can?t go in your private capacity as a citizen; you must order it through the Ministry of Health. Mohomed filled me with the details, so here they are.??
Desperate and against all odds, his father admitted him to the Maharagama Hospital.? The hospital wasn?t privately owned. For someone like Mohomed, it was kind of a last resort you?d run to when you?d run out of options elsewhere.
A Tender Committee needs to be appointed. Once the tender is called, you have to wait for 42 days (a statutory requirement) before you close it. Then the tender must be approved by the Tender Board, which can take anywhere between two weeks and two months. The Minister?s final approval can then take up to another two months.??
Ordering a Scanner, even after all that, isn?t easy. You need to open a Letter of Credit. You then need to tell the manufacturer who scraped through the tender process to assemble it as per the requirements of the hospital. That takes around two months. Shipping it takes three weeks, fixing it in the hospital takes six, while radiologists at the Cancer Hospital need to be trained to handle it. Meanwhile, you need to import fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), a chemical used in the machine,?from India.??
And then there?s the hospital itself. You can?t move the machine into it as you would another machine. You need to move it into another building and what?s more, you need approval from the Atomic Energy Board, after which you can finally get the machine down. And that after more than 50 weeks, 12 months, or one year. Waiting for one year, as I?ve pointed out before, means waiting for death to take over about 13,000 other people (in keeping with those statistics). Which in turn means that the Ministry should have done the needful and, all in all, quickened the process.??
Have they though? The short answer, not really. The campaign that officially ended 16 months ago has lagged. To get a PET Scanner requires getting through several barriers. That?s part and parcel of the law, and how it?s institutionalised to ensure that everything involving money, and public causes, is planned for while adhering to both its letter and spirit. One can argue that it takes time, that it?s an inconvenience, and that it?s casually done away with once a powerful politico wants to get his or her cronies through. Even with such arguments, however, the original argument for getting such processes screened through legal mechanisms is powerful, defensible.??
But there were other ways. The PET Scanner could have been called for through a collective Cabinet decision, instead of letting it be shrouded with regulation after regulation that can at the end of the day prove fatal for those 13,000 people. It wasn?t. Why not? Is the Scanner so inessential (the fact that it?s considered a necessity even in private establishments indicates otherwise) in the minds of our officials???
I am writing this with some anger. And not for no reason. 16 months ago, the campaign was launched. 16 months later, that Scanner is yet to come. Not just yet to come, but yet to come with a key person behind the campaign missing. For M. S. H. Mohomed?s son, Humaid, that young man who got the father interested in this whole matter, passed away a few weeks ago. I mentioned something about the personal being stronger than the social in getting us to understand tragedy. The personal, ladies and gentlemen, is strongest in times of loss and bereavement. That?s where we are, and the fact that no official has stuck to his or her word regarding the betterment of the only affordable Cancer Hospital in this country tells a lot about us. Rather badly.? ?

Rupee edges down as banks buy dollars to cover import payments
	
REUTERS: The Sri Lankan rupee weakened yesterday, as demand for dollars from importers to pay for their purchases outweighed conversions of the greenback into local currency by exporters, dealers said.
The spot rupee, which traded at 153.19 per dollar earlier in the day, recovered to close at 153.10/20, but weaker from Wednesday?s closing level of 153.00/10.
?The importer demand was there throughout the day. Both state and foreign banks bought dollars to cover some import bills,? said a currency dealer who did not wish to be named.
The rupee has been under pressure since January after the Central Bank stopped defending the currency and started buying dollars to build up the country?s depleted foreign currency reserves.
The island nation has seen Rs.17.8 billion of net inflows into equities this year as of yesterday?s close, and Rs.17.3 billion worth inflows into government securities as of September 20 this year, official data showed.

?The ?paththuwa? has a therapeutic effect that helps the merging of the broken bones by inducing calcium production and also heals damaged blood vessels,?- Dr. K. A. Nirosha Tharangani, Senior Medical Officer, CMC
Sticks and stones can break your bones. But there are so many other ways to fracture your bones. It?s no pleasant experience at all. In fact it is very painful. Ayurveda is a very well-known form of alternative medicine when it comes to treating fractures in Sri Lanka. Dr. K. A. Nirosha Tharangani, Senior Medical Officer, CMC, who serves in the Ayurveda Specialized Treatment Centre at Kollupitiya (Colombo 3) provided an insight into the treatment of fractures through Ayurveda.? ?
?
What is a fracture?? ?
Simply, a fracture is a break in the bone. According to Dr. Tharangani, a fracture can be classified under 2 types. They are simple fractures and compound fractures. ?A simple fracture is when a bone breaks into two but does not pierce the skin. During such a fracture the bone is not exposed to the air. But a compound fracture is a more serious condition. In a compound fracture, the break in the bone causes the bone to pierce through the skin and protrude. There are multi-fractures also where bones are broken in several places,? said Dr. Tharangani.? ?
?
How serious are fractures?? ?
The severity of the fracture depends on the force that causes the injury. Regardless whether the fracture is mild or severe, it is painful. However Dr. Tharangani stated that simple fractures are treatable through Ayurveda. She said that the bone can be restored to the normal conditions 100%. But the medical officer also accentuated that compound fractures are severe. ?Compound fractures are surgical conditions which require surgery and I do not recommend Ayurveda treatment for compound fractures. We as doctors, be it Ayurvedic or otherwise, look into the best interests of the patient because a patient?s life is very valuable. As an Ayurvedic doctor I strongly advise against Ayurvedic treatments for patients with compound fractures. Ayurveda is inappropriate for compound fracture and multi-fracture treatments,? she explained.?
?
?
Causes for fractures? ?
?Fractures can occur through traumatic incidents. Injuries during sports, accidents associated with vehicles and falls are listed as traumatic incidents. When a patient suffers from ailments such as osteoporosis, the bones weaken. This gives way to fractures easily despite the fall or accident being a minor one. This is common among the elderly who suffer from weakened bones,? stated Dr. Tharangani.? ?
?
Dos and Don?ts? ?
When a person experiences a fall or is involved in an incident this may cause an injury. The injury could be a sprain, a tear or a fracture. The condition could be any of the above. While fractures are deciphered by an excruciating pain that could even cause the collapse of the patient, tears and sprains are also painful. These conditions are often misunderstood. So it is strongly advised that the patient immediately seeks medical attention. If the patient mistakes a fracture for a sprain and tries to self-treat it, the condition would worsen. Some patients use the aid of an ice pack to reduce pain. Even this is inappropriate. Dr. Tharangani explained the steps that have to be taken after the injury. ?In Ayurveda, we strongly advise against the use of an ice pack following a fracture as we believe it could cause blood clots and muscle tightening and aggravate the condition of the patient. Don?t move the injured area at all. Tie the place of injury with a cloth and bring the patient for medical treatment immediately,? she advised. Upon consultation with the patient, an X-ray is prescribed. Depending on the X-ray, the condition of the injury is diagnosed and if it is a simple fracture, it is treated through Ayurveda. In the case of a multi-fracture, Ayurvedic treatment is inappropriate as it demands surgical treatment.? ?
?
The procedures? ?
A Plaster of Paris cast is your usual fracture first aid. But in Ayurveda, first aid treatment is different. Dr. Tharangani explained the procedure. ?The bones are set into place after oils are applied to the injured area. It is then sustained with wooden splinters and a ?paththuwa?,? she said. The word ?paththuwa? is often heard in Ayurveda. The Ayurvedic doctor explained that a ?paththuwa? is an Ayurvedic paste. It is made using all sorts of herbs by boiling them. These contents are then mixed and ground into a paste. ?The ?paththuwa? has a therapeutic effect that helps the merging of the broken bones by inducing calcium production and also heals damaged blood vessels. The herbs used in the paste vary according to the patient and the fracture condition,?she explained.?
?When patients keep their injury part of the body immobilized, they will experience stiffness in the joints. So we provide physiotherapy by teaching the patient small exercises, so as to avoid stiffness in the injured area,? she added.? ?
?It is important not to wet the injured area after receiving treatment. If the fracture is wrapped up with just a ?paththuwa?, we usually instruct the patient to wash the injured area with hot water prior to the next consultation. If the fracture is wrapped up with wooden splinters, patients should never remove them. It is something that only the doctor should do,? Dr. Tharangani affirmed.? ?
?
Fracture frequency? ?
On inquiry, Dr. Tharangani stated that the amount of fracture injuries has increased substantially. ?With the onset of the rains, the number of patients with fractures arriving at the Ayurveda Centre has increased. An increase is seen especially in Colombo city limits. The elderly and small people form the majority among these patients. It is usually simple fractures that are very common in Sri Lanka. Compound fractures occur very rarely and that too during very severe accidents,?she said.

The benefits of Palliative Care
	
?
?
Ageing is a wonderful process of nature. We all age on a daily basis and what matters is what you do when you are strong and healthy so that you can be satisfied and relaxed when ageing takes place. Illnesses and negative conditions, that weaken your body, are highly likely to plague you towards the latter part of your life as the body?s defense mechanisms tend to fail with time. But the worse scenario is when your body becomes a target of aggressive pathological enemies when you are young. This potentially unfortunate condition is becoming a serious issue nowadays due to the extensive emergence of the harmful and toxic agents we are exposed to everywhere we go.? ?
Our discussion today not only focuses on the middle aged and elderly ill people, but also on the younger generation. Such patients have become victims of terminal illnesses and suffer from disabling conditions with no hope in life. But should the social attitude towards these people be this? Should they be cornered or left on a bed with sympathy being shown just because they lack the capacity to stand and run around like us?? ?
During a time like this, where there is a constant struggle between ?living with suffering? and ?choosing death?, palliative care brings joy to these patients and helps them enjoy the optimum quality of life. To know more about this timely topic, we had a Q & A session with Dr. Chamath Fernando, lecturer from the Department of Family Medicine who is currently reading for his Masters in Palliative Medicine at Cardiff University, United Kingdom.
?
What is Palliative care?
The World Health Organization defines palliative care as ?an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problems. These problems are associated with life-threatening illness and can be prevented. Relief can be brought to those suffering by means of early identification.?
The modern concept of palliative care was introduced by a physician named Dame Cecily Mary Strode Saunders. She is world renown for her work and for introducing this novel concept. She also established the first modern hospice; St. Christopher?s Hospice in 1967 affiliated to King?s College, London. She emphasised the importance of alleviation of ?total pain? (physical, psychological, social and spiritual dimensions of pain) as a whole, treating patients with due dignity, compassion and respect as well as the need for rigorous scientific methodology to be adhered to, in testing treatment.? ?
?Known in simple terms as ?comfort care?, palliative care comprises a team of doctors (general practitioners and other specialists), nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, complementary medical therapists (e.g. acupuncture therapists), psychologists, social workers, religious priests, volunteers, care givers and pastoral care givers. The care is often organized in three major forms. Hospital based palliative care teams, hospices or community based services extend care to such patients. These patients are taken good care of and steps are taken to alleviate the patients? distress by all means,? said Dr. Fernando.?
?
?
Is this the same as ?Terminal care??
?Well, that is another overlapping term, I would like to highlight. ?Terminal care? which is now used to denote the care given to those who have days to weeks of prognosis (life expectancy). This is a significant role under the umbrella of palliative care where the care model alters further, aiming at patients? comfort at the prime discretion of the patient. For instance, while providing palliative care in the initial stages of the disease the physicians attempt to give symptomatic medications via mouth or rectally at the expense of intravenous (more hurtful) route.? ?
But towards the last few days of the life the patient?s ability to swallow as well as to absorb orally administered drugs through the stomach diminish. This results in a decision to administer the pain drugs, hydration etc. via subcutaneous route (into the layer of fat underneath the skin) through a fine needle which allows better absorption of medicine with minimal complications,? stated Dr. Fernando.? ?
What exactly do you do during such care and how does it differ from general medical treatment?
The term ?pallium? in Greek describes a large rectangular ?cloak? similar to ones worn by ancient philosophers. Likewise, the concept of ?Palliative Care?, sharing the same etymology means to cover all aspects of patient care, addressing the physical ailments, psychosocial problems and spiritual suffering thus aiming to attain the best possible ?Quality of Life? (QOL) for the patient and his or her loved ones.? ?
A misconception that remains even among the healthcare staff is that palliative care is only intended for the patients who have been intensively treated for medical conditions with less success. Especially patients with cancer are being referred for palliative care when all modes of invasive treatment have been deemed futile, which is also observed in developed parts of the world to date. According to the current best practice, the ideal time to incorporate palliative approach to care is the sooner any patient, regardless of his age, is diagnosed with a terminal illness.? ?
Any disease has its own ?natural history? of progression which is familiar to the clinicians with ages of experience and scientific evidence.? ?
?For example a patient who is diagnosed with ?small cell lung cancer? has an average lifespan of three months ahead of him from the time of diagnosis. It is also known that the potential major symptoms that the patient will encounter are related to respiratory or breathing problems followed by other physical symptoms related to spread of the cancer,? said Dr. Fernando.?
Considering all these facts the palliative approach to care is incorporated to the patient?s plan of management at the diagnosis itself.? ?
?
Initially the Oncologist (Cancer specialist) might decide to commence chemotherapy to assess the response and would decide to continue for some time.? ?
	Meanwhile, the Palliative Physician will attend to the patient?s symptoms in view of alleviating negative issues like difficulties during breathing, anxiety, depression, spiritual suffering or existential suffering. They coordinate care with the team involved aiming to achieve the best quality of life for the patient.? ?
	As time is limited the patient will also be suggested to make arrangements for last wills and attend to other testamentary deals.? ?
	The patient will be encouraged to engage in activities that are pleasurable to him (e.g. one patient might want to visit his old village house which must be respected).? ?
	nEventually the team would discuss and decide to diminish the chemotherapy which seems to be only adding adverse outcomes rather than offering a cure.? ?
According to Dr. Fernando, the patient-doctor relationship here is not limited to a single point of contact; but is an ongoing process which builds up a therapeutic alliance between the patient, family and the professional team.? ?
?Apart from the wonders that the drugs and interventions can do, as palliative physicians what we believe in is the ?human factor? or that a good human to human interaction can bring about miracles. Sometimes all what the patient needs to overcome his existential suffering is an actively listening human being at his presence. So consultations and the time spent with palliative patients can be extensive.?
It is also a known fact that the healthcare team members involved in palliative care also need help themselves, as getting exposed to the saddening stories of the patients render them ?burnt out? by the end of the day? concluded Dr. Fernando.? ?
We are hoping to discuss on the ethical, legal aspects of palliative care and euthanasia in weeks to come.

Trishaw with 13 schoolchildren aboard comes to grief in Elpitiya
	
Thirteen schoolchildren and a three-wheeler driver sustained serious injuries when a trishaw bringing children back home after school crashed into the rear of a moving tipper-truck on the Awiththawa Road in the Walahena area in Elpitiya last afternoon. The condition of nine students was reported to be critical.
Police investigations revealed that two students who were scheduled to travel in this trishaw had dropped out due to a lack of space for them to get in.
Headquarters Inspector of the Elpitiya Police B. L. Ajith Prasanna said that area residents had been alerted by the cries of the wounded students emanating from the spot where the accident took place and made arrangements to rush them to the nearest hospital.
He stated that the main reason for such accidents taking place was driver negligence in loading excessive numbers into their vehicles. He also blamed the children's parents for not being more vigilant about the transport arrangements of their children.
A spokesman for the Elpitiya Hospital said that four students as well as the three-wheeler driver were rushed to the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital as their condition was said to be critical.
The students, aged between 7 and 14, were residents of Katapala, Ganegoda and Awiththawa and attended Ganegoda Maha Vidyalaya as well as several other schools in the Elpitiya area, police said. (Janath de Silva)

We'll have a 21st century-based education system soon: PM
	
Sri Lanka is undergoing a difficult and crucial period where the economy is concerned but important sectors such as education will be structured in line with the demands of the 21st century, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.
He said this when visiting a smart class room at the Sri Jayawardenepura Maha Vidyalaya.
?The current year 2017 and the years 2018 and 2019 will be difficult years where the economy is concerned as Sri Lanka will have to concentrate on debt payments during that time. However we will manage the economy and pave the way for a technology-based education system,? the Prime Minister said. ?The Government has decided to introduce an education system in line with the 21st century. Smart classroom concept is a part of it. We will go to the second step of distributing tablets next year. Each child will be made to spend 13 years in school. We will have to go in for the new education system in a decade. We can do it now as we have the funds. This should have been started two decades years ago. Both main parties which are governing now should see to it that the education system does not change with the change of government. It could be done as both parties are governing together unlike in the past. However we need funds. We did not have funds in 2015 but managed to stabilize the economy this year. Therefore the revenue has exceeded debt servicing. Schoolchildren will have employment opportunities when they leave school if there are investments. The strategy of the government is to attract investments.?
The Prime Minister said Sri Jayewardenepura MV was a Christian Institute in the past.
"It was a seminary where Church of England priests were trained. Later the laymen were also brought here. Students who learned in this school those days became successful in the society with their knowledge of English, Latin, Greek and Mathematics and other subjects. Therefore a handful of people in society had opportunities. They had opportunities to enter universities. Some went to Indian universities others to countries such as Britain, the two Obeysekeras in this school went to Oxford University. The British Governor used to visit this school annually during the colonial period. British Governor Robert Horton signed the visitors book in this school saying the most valuable gift a country could give its youth is education. Then he decided to open schools for lay students. First such school was Colombo Academy (Royal College) originally in Pettah. English medium education was introduced in Sri Lanka before many other countries. It was a great opportunity over other countries. However Sri Lanka could not sustain it. Other countries which introduced English medium education after Sri Lanka had managed to benefit more than Sri Lanka,? he said. (Yohan Perera)

## Title: When your child suffers from diarrhea

When your child suffers from diarrhea
	
?
Diarrhea is a common problem among children. It?s when one?s bowel movements or stools are loose and watery. Speaking to Dr. Kosala Karunaratne, Consultant Pediatrician, Lady Ridgeway Hospital, the Health Capsule learned how diarrhea can lead to dehydration and make patients suffer from malnutrition and lactose intolerance in the long run. Dr. Karunaratne explained how this diarrhea can be treated and what measures should be taken when a child suffers from this condition.??
?
Causes
Speaking about the causes of diarrhea Dr. Karunaratne said, ? Diarrhea can be caused by infections, viruses and even bacteria. Out of these, the most common causes are infections and viruses. There is also a virus called rotavirus which can cause diarrhea. There is a vaccine for this virus that is given as a preventive measure,?said Dr. Karunaratne.?
He further stated that there are a variety of ways these viruses, infections and bacteria can enter a child?s system. ?They can contract it orally. So if you don?t wash your hands and don?t keep clean then viruses can spread when food is ingested. Some viral diarrhea can be caused due to influenza. The most common way to contract it is orally,? he added.?
?Practicing good hygiene, washing, boiling water, proper preparing of food etc. are very important. Infections are the most common causes for diarrhea, but at the same time you can get diarrhea due to food poisoning. Food poisoning is caused by the toxins released into the foods by bacteria. These toxins cause diarrhea. So the symptoms can appear immediately after eating the bad food.? he said.
?
??
Symptoms
Speaking of the symptoms Dr. Karunaratne said, ?Usually watery stools, which are more frequent than is usual for the child is the main symptom. Sometimes watery stools are normal in some children. If it is more than what is normal for that child it is called diarrhea. This can differ from child to child. Diarrhea can also be associated with vomiting?.? ?
?
Complications
According to Dr. Karunaratne, dehydration is the worst complication that can occur from diarrhea. ?The most serious complication is dehydration. Children die not due to the diarrhea, but due to dehydration. Which is why we have to focus on how to prevent the child from getting dehydrated when the child has diarrhea,?said Dr. Karunaratne.?
?Sometimes the child can get complications due to electrolyte abnormalities. When the child has diarrhea, it can lose sodium and potassium, and this can cause complications in the electrolytes,? he added.? Dr. Karunaratne further stated that the long term problems that can occur are malnutrition and lactose intolerance. ?Later on, a child who has diarrhea can suffer from malnutrition. The child?s nutrition can reduce, so under nutrition or malnutrition can set in the child long term because of the diarrhea. Another small complication is that some diarrhea can be persistent and can last for some time. That is due to what is called lactose intolerance. That is when children get diarrhea due to absence of an intestinal enzymes that break down lactose. Then they become intolerant to milk based products. Thus the long term problems are malnutrition and lactose intolerance,?he said.?
?
Treatment
Dr. Karunaratne stated that the main treatment is the prevention of dehydration. ?For that there is a wonder medicine, which is ORS (Oral Rehydration Solution) like jeevani. The person who found out ORS received a Nobel Prize. It was one of the greatest advances in medicine as it was about how to prevent dehydration. Earlier children died due to dehydration and now you can prevent it by giving ORS. When a child is dehydrated and you give jeevani or ORS it will be absorbed by the body very fast, due to its composition,? explained Dr. Karunaratne.?
?You suffer from diarrhea because the viruses and bacteria prevent the absorption of water into the body. And the toxins of the bacteria and even the virus prevent the absorption of water. So that water passes on. The ORS reverses that. It makes the body absorb water. That is why it is one of the greatest advances in medicine. Thus, one of the main stages of treatment is ORS,? he said??
He further explained, ?You don?t really have to stop the diarrhea itself as it is self-limiting, which means that it will reduce on its own and the child will recover. What you have to do is prevent dehydration. Zinc can be given to reduce duration due to the diarrhea as it contains vitamins and is highly recommended. Now it is thought that probiotics, which is the good bacteria, may stop the duration of diarrhea. But that is a controversial theory. Some people give yoghurt. If you think that the child is suffering from bacterial diarrhea you can give antibiotics. It is difficult to say whether a child has a bacterial or a virus diarrhea, but there are ways of testing it. This will be prescribed by a pediatrician. The unnecessary use of antibiotics can also be harmful for the child. If you taken antibiotics when you have a virus diarrhea you can knock off the good bacteria, which can make the diarrhea worse. Which is why? decisions should be taken by a doctor, specialising with children,?he explained.?
?
Diet
Speaking of a diarrhea patient?s diet he said, ?Give a nutritional diet that the child can tolerate. When the child is suffering from diarrhea there will be loss of appetite. So the child will not be hungry, thus you will have to give such patients fruits and things that are tolerable and easily absorbed. You mustn?t stop giving nutrition to the child because otherwise the child can get malnourished. This is because the child can lose a lot of nutrition. And you shouldn?t try to rest the bowel, which is what was done in the olden days. If you do this the child will lose nutrition. That is why you have to give the child to eat, especially things that are easy to absorb. You must feed the child as much as possible,?he affirmed.?
