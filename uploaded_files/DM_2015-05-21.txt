Lanka student finds green way to tackle oil spills
	
A 24-year-old Sri Lankan post-graduate student in Chemistry at the University of Maryland USA, has discovered an agent which will clear oil spills in the sea without damaging the aquatic environment.
The student, Jasmin Athas, working under the supervision of Professor Srinivasa Raghavan, an alumnus of IIT Madras, found that a mixture of two food-grade molecules, Lecithin and Tween 80, is an effective emulsifier and is able to disperse crude oil in sea water. In a paper published in July 2014 in Langmuir, the journal of the American Chemical Society, Athas reports that Lecithin and Tween 80, blended in a 60:40 ratio to create smaller droplets of oil than current dispersants like Corexit 9500A. The L and T combine allows for more efficient dispersion, Athas claims.
Furthermore, Lecithin and Tween 80 are environmentally safe and edible. Lecithin is found in soya beans and is used in making chocolates, and Tween 80 is used to emulsify ice cream. Jasmin was drawn into oil spill research after it was found that the chemicals used in tackling oil spills, like Corexit 9500A, were themselves highly toxic. Raghavan, Athas and Professor Vijay John joined the project. (New Indian Express)

The Islamic Finance Unit of Richard Pieris Finance bagged the Gold Award recently for Emerging Finance Entity of the year, organised by UTO Edu Consult in Sri Lanka, Islamic Banking Finance Industry (SLIBFI)
This is the fourth consecutive year the SLIBFI held this awards ceremony among the Islamic finance operators that includes commercial banks, insurance companies and financial institutions.
The evaluation of the performance of each company in the respective fields is totally independent and it was conducted in association with KPMG Sri Lanka, the independent auditors and the UTO Edu Consult.
Among all the veterans in the finance companies sector, ARIJ, the branded name for the Islamic Finance Unit of the Richard Pieris Finance won this award and as the CEO, I must emphasise that it is a remarkable achievement of our company, said K. M. M. Jabir, Chief Executive Officer of Richard Pieris Finance Ltd.
By thanking the Almighty for guiding us to achieve this prestigious award, as the youngest company in Sri Lanka, it gives us a tremendous boost and increases the motivation level of the whole team of our financial institution, pointed out Jabir.
The ARIJ Islamic Financial Unit of Richard Pieris Finance has just completed one year building up a portfolio of one billion. The success behind this award is the trust placed by our valuable customers and the total commitment of our dedicated staff members of this unit, noted the CEO.
In Sri Lanka, the Islamic finance industry is gathering momentum with about 15 players already on the platform. We met all criteria successfully and the independent evaluators unanimously decided that the emerging institution award should go to Richard Pieris Finance Ltd.
Our Islamic Finance Unit ARIJ offers innovative products to accommodate our customer requests in compliance with Shariah principles. We have been experiencing demand from our customers for various business transactions. Our dedicated and committed employees meet those requirements in consultation with our Sharia scholars, said Jabir.
The companys Shariah scholars are internationally qualified, experienced members who are well versed in Islamic finance AAOIFI standards. So the company meets international standards in delivering our Islamic Finance standards, said CEO Jabir.
Richard Pieris Finance maintains the strong firewall between the conventional and the Islamic financial operations. And these facilities are offered to all Sri Lankans irrespective of religion or race. Islamic Finance Unit of Richard Pieris Finance has quite a number of non Muslims in the client base which is ever growing.
We thank our customers and our staff members and the Board of Directors who are committed to comply in the growth of Islamic finance of Richard Pieris.
Commenting on the future, he said the company had plans to go into other categories as well in the years to come.
Pointing out the advantages of investing in Islamic banking, Jabir said that in conventional fixed deposits, the interest rates are predetermined. Investments may generate more profit than the pre-determined rate but your return will be confined to that percentage. However, in Islamic Finance, you stand to gain more when that financial institution earns more profit and your share of profit will go over and above the predetermined rate. That is the advantage. Past experience has proved that none of the Islamic financial institutions had incurred a loss. In Islamic finance, they make the profit and share it, said CEO Jabir.

Strong core-banking operations boost  DVB bottom line
	
The DFCC group licensed commercial banking arm, DFCC Vardhana Bank PLC (DVB), posted a net profit of Rs.336.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 (1Q15), recording a 506 percent growth over the corresponding growth last year, the interim financials released to the Colombo Stock Exchange showed.
The performance was possible due to strong core-banking operations, non-fund-based incomes and lesser provisions against possible loan losses.
The earnings per share increased to Rs.1.18 from 20 cents a year ago.
The net interest income rose 38.2 percent year-on-year (YoY) as the interest expenses fell at a faster pace than the interest income. This is because the re-pricing of the loans and deposits of the bank were under the low interest rates environment.
Interest expenses fell 32.3 percent YoY to Rs.996.7 million while the interest income fell by 9.6 percent YoY to Rs.1.97 billion.
Despite the falling interest rates the bank managed to increase its net interest margin to 3.79 percent from 3.67 percent on December 31, 2014.
The bank said the loan growth observed in the latter half of last year contributed to the exceptionally well first quarter performance of 2015. 
Meanwhile, the banks loan book recorded a 4.9 percent growth during 1Q15. Further, the return on equity (RoE) grew up to 15.21 percent, slightly less than the industry average hovers around 16 percent. The RoE by December 31, 2014 stood at 13.38 percent.
Deposits slightly fell to Rs.69.6 billion from Rs.70.7 billion predominantly due to the fall in rupee deposits as the investor appetite is lesser for bank deposits under the lower interest rates.
Meanwhile, the non-interest incomes too rose by 58 percent YoY to Rs.408 million supported by the fee and commission-based incomes, net gains from trading, income from financial investments and other operating income.
Further, the total impairment provisions against loans and other losses fell by 52 percent YoY to Rs.133 million.
The total operating expenses rose 20 percent YoY to Rs.675.7 million.
DVBs capital adequacy levels stands comfortably above the regulatory minimums as both Tier I and Tier II capital adequacy ratio stood at 11.41 percent and 12.22 percent, respectively. However, the two ratios slightly weakened due to asset growth from 12.24 percent and 13.08 percent on December 31, 2014.
After the termination of the merger between NDB Bank PLC and DFCC Bank PLC along with DVB to create a development financier, DFCC Bank last week sought the approval from the Central Bank to amalgamate DVB and run as a single entity.
DVB has 137 branches and extension offices which include 59 units across the Sri Lanka Post network.
DFCC Bank holds a 99.2 percent stake in DVB.

Vasu flares up with Ranil
	
	Democratic Left Front Leader Vasudeva Nanayakkara and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe embroiled themselves in a heated exchange of words in Parliament today.
	The two leaders started the dust up with each other during cross talk over the request for an urgent debate in the House on the report by the panel of lawyers who examined the controversial Central Bank bond issue.
	Mr. Nanayakkara, who rose on a point of order, appeared to be furious after the Prime Minister made certain remarks asking him to sit down. He shot back at the Prime Minister with a verbal harangue for a few minutes.
	At one point, Mr. Nanayakkara said, "Who the hell are you ask me to sit down
	The Prime Minister also responded, but his words could not be heard properly in the press gallery apparently due to his mike being switched off at the time. However, once he was heard saying, "You have not shaved your beard even. At least, shave your beard and come."
	It was a moment of amusement for some opposition and government members as they giggled and thumbed their desks upon hearing various remarks during the cross talks marked with certain obscenities at times.
	The public gallery was full of school children at the time, and Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa alerted it to the House.
	"Please mind that there are school children in the gallery viewing the proceedings," he said. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)
