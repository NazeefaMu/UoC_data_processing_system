Bombings are a near-daily occurrence in Mogadishu. Most are claimed by the al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab militia, which is fighting to overthrow the weak U.N.-backed government and drive out the African Union peacekeeping force that supports it.

Children with Autism: Heroes Resource Centre
	
Helps them find their voice
Nine-year-old Surani was unable to attend school with her two sisters, due to her autism. We were finding it very difficult to find an appropriate school for Surani, her mother explained. However, Surani is slowly finding her voice, thanks to the Heroes Resource Centre. The institutions courses are helping her immensely with her speech. We really want to continue this programme further and find a good school for her very soon, her mother said. 
Opened on March 2 by brand ambassador Natasha Rathnayake, the Heroes Resource Centre supports children with autism through speech and occupational therapy. These services are provided free of charge, easing the burden for families of special-needs children. Suranis family, for instance, struggles to make ends meet, having two other children to feed and educate on a single salary. Then there is Pawana, a four-year-old from Nawalapitiya, whose parents have had to move to Maharagama so that he can receive the care he needs. Pawanas parents find it difficult to pay the rent for their home in Colombo, but are determined to offer the best education for their children  including speech therapy for their son.



Although newly opened, the Heroes Resource Centre is already helping 8 children with delays in speech development. These children attend the Navodaya School, founded by Lakshmi Karunajeewa 12 years ago. Herself, a teacher for children with special needs, Lakshmi realised early on that the children she taught needed a special education plan in order to help them become independent. Parents think that at 5 years, their child should go to school. However, these children have different needs, she explained. 
The children sponsored through the Heroes Resource Centre have the benefit of more time and attention. The speech therapy programmes in other hospitals havent enough time to really ensure there is measurable progress. Here, each child receives half an hour of speech therapy once a week, Lakshmi explained. 
The dedicated volunteer teachers at the Centre work to unlock the hidden skills of these children. The extra time is paying off. Children who once had trouble focusing for more than one or two minutes are now responding to their names and learning new words, after just 6 months on the programme. 


Some of the children sponsored under the Heroes Resource Centre have expanded their vocabulary from one word to two. Some childrens IQ levels have improved, while we have also seen behavioural improvements and better attention from another two children, Lakshmi said. 
With more funding, the Heroes Resource Centre can support more children with delayed speech development. They could also expand the services they offer to include physiotherapy, behavioural therapy and a range of other techniques, to improve the quality of life of the children currently supported under the programme. 
We have had to struggle to find funding from the beginning. It would be a huge benefit too if these children, who currently attend after-school sessions, could attend the morning sessions with the other children of Navodaya School, which would help them develop their social skills. That can only be achieved with more support. We could even support more deserving children, Lakshmi said. 


The Heroes Resource Centre is funded by Colombo Cinnamon Round Table 4, a non-profit club which engages in community service activities. Colombo Cinnamon Round Table 4 is linked to the global Round Table International service club. 
The Heroes Resource Centre was founded out of a desire to give children with autism the best chance of being self-sufficient. The children enrolled in the centre come from deserving families, who otherwise would be unable to afford the type of tailored education programmes that children with autism need, said Chairman of the Colombo Cinnamon Round Table 4, Amir Abdeen. 
There is a great deal of stigma attached to special needs children  they are often ostracised. However as the Heroes Resource Centre shows, children with autism are in fact capable of much more than we realise. They deserve the best education and care available, so that they can become happy, productive members of society. We hope that with the generosity of the public, we can expand the Centre even more. 

For more information, or for donations, please contact the Community Service Convenor of Colombo Cinnamon Round Table 4, Farzan Najmudeen on 0773110521.

Magic numbers used in combination with signs
	

The special significance attached to numbers 12, 60, 7 and 13 from ancient times was discussed in the lead article carried under the title: Lucky and Unlucky Numbers on the Jyotisha page last Friday. The reasons for the ancient Egyptians to consider Number 12 special, for the ancient Babylonians to treat 60 as the most meaningful number, for the widespread emotional attachment to 7 as well as for the stigma attached to Number 13 were explained in that article.
A combination of single numbers:

There is one combination of single numbers which is supposed to cause the worst possible magical ill-effect - the number combination 666. This combination of numbers, by the way, lends credence and support to the theory of great Chinese thinker Confucius that the world is not ruled by kings but by signs and symbols.
The whole issue goes back to the New Testaments Book of Revelation, particularly the verse which says,
One who understands can calculate the number of the beast, for it is a number that stands for a person. His number is six hundred and sixty-six (Rev. 13:18).







Number of the Beast
The Number of the Beast is a term in the Book of Revelation, of the New Testament, that is associated with the Beast of Revelation in chapter 13.[1] In most manuscripts of the New Testament and in English translations of the Bible, the number of the beast is 666.
Taking the great Confucius theory into consideration that the world is ruled by signs and symbols, and further associating numbers with signs or symbols one could ask, why is the sign of the beast used by humans and for what purpose or motives the number combination 666 is used by anyone One could cite a visible example where this magic numbers have been used in combination with 3 signs. It is an energy drink. A common story circulating on the internet alleges that the energy drinks logo resembles three Hebrew vavs, and that since the value for a vav in Hebrew numerology is 6, and the Biblical Number of the Beast is 666, the logo reveals the energy drink to be a Satanic drink. In November 2014, a video of Christine Weick speculating a relation between the drink and Satan was published on YouTube, which has drawn over eight million views to date.


There are many instances on record where people have taken prompt action to get rid of the 666 dreading its magical ill-effect when confronted with it in their daily life. We wish to cite only two cases in this connection.

In 1989, Nancy and Ronald Wilson Reagan, when moving to their home in the Bel-Air section of Los Angeles after the 1988 election, had its address666 St. Cloud Roadchanged to 668 St. Cloud Road.
In 2003, U. S. Route 666 in New Mexico was changed to U. S. Route 491. A New Mexico spokesperson stated, The devils out of here, and we say goodbye and good riddance.
The phobia has been a motif in various horror films such as The Omen and its 2006 remake. The number of the beast also appears in other films such as Pulp Fiction, The Doom Generation, End of Days, Bedazzled and The Phantom of the Opera.
In November 2013, Codie Thacker, a cross-country runner at Whitley County High School in Williamsburg, Kentucky, refused to run in her Kentucky High School Athletic Association regional meet, forfeiting a chance at qualifying for the state championships, when her coach drew bib number 666.
The Siemens ACS-64 locomotives of Amtrak are numbered 600 to 665 and 667 to 670, leaving out the number 666.
In 2015, US Representative Joe Barton had the number of a legislative bill he had introduced changed from 666 to 702 because the original bill number carried many different negative connotations, according to a spokesperson.

Man dashes dog on the floor killing it
	
A story of human beings' brutality against what should be 'man's best friend' was reported from Anguruwathota, Pilawagupitiya where a dog had strayed into a neighbours compound only to be attacked by the dog in that house and suffered an injury to one of its eyes as a result.
The owner of the injured dog was incensed by what his neighbour's dog had done to his pet and he got hold of the attacker and dashed the dog on the floor, killing it instantly.
His own dog attempted to show his owner its appreciation by rubbing itself on his owner's leg. But instead of being happy by the animal's affectionate nature, the man lifted his own dog off the floor and dashed him on the road as well, injuring it.
Luckily for the animal though, it was not too badly hurt and managed to scamper away and escaped with its life. Onlookers, who saw what had transpired, brought the incident to the notice of the police who took the man into custody. The suspect was to be produced in the Horana Court.

Minister says no immediate need to open spill gates
	
Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya rejected rumours that the prevailing flood threat had been caused by the opening of spill gates in the hydro power reservoirs. He told the media that none of the reservoirs were at spill level to necessitate the opening of the spill gates.
The quantity of water at the Mausakelle Reservoir is 30.9 per cent of its capacity and the Castlereagh Reservoir 36 per cent. These two main reservoirs need a much larger intake of water to reach spill level. Laxapana, Wimalasurendra and Canyon Reservoirs have reached spill level but however, spill overs at these smaller reservoirs will not create a flood threat. Dehiowita Division in the Kegalle District is the worst affected by the prevailing rains. Two schoolchildren had died after being buried under a mound of earth at Welangalla while two others are known to have been buried under a mound of earth when watching an earth slip at Ambalanpitiya. More than 2,000 families have been displaced in the area and steps are now being taken to provide urgent relief to those affected, he said.
The minister said there was no need just now to open any of the spill gates in the reservoirs.

## Title: Mount of Jupiter

Mount of Jupiter
	
Human hand  Trailblazer of Human Civilization  Part 10

Mounts, the slight elevations on the palm assume great significance in the study of Palmistry, because they cause the formation and development of the main lines on the palm. Besides, the Mounts account for the main divisions that make up the palm.
According to ancient Indian palmists, there are seven mounts on the palm named after the seven main planets in the Solar system excluding the shadow planets, Rahu and Ketu who too figure in Astrological calculations. However, modem Palmistry experts have divided the palm into 12 Mounts, sub-dividing certain areas on the palm assigned to the main planets earlier.
The planets after whom the five additional Mounts are named are
Harshal, Neptune. Rahu (Dragons Head), Ketu (Dragons Tail), and Pluto.
	Uranus is referred to as Harshal, Herschel and Prajapati in Hindu Astrology)




The Mount of Jupiter.
This Mount is located at the base of the first or Index Finger. It extends downwards up to the Head Line and sidewise up to the percussion of the hand.
Qualities the Mount of Jupiter represents
The Mount of Jupiter represents power, leadership, authority and wisdom and godly qualities. Individuals with a prominent Mount of Jupiter have a keen sense of self-respect and would not do anything considered below their dignity.
They are learned and benevolent and are highly respected in society. They do not get ruffled or disconcerted even under trying conditions.
If the Mount is less prominent or under-developed, the owner of the hand would be deficient in above mentioned qualities.
Physical appearance and traits of character
Persons with a prominent Mount of Jupiter are of medium height and are healthy. They have a smiling face. They are kind-hearted philanthropists. They are more interested in earning a good name and a good reputation than earning wealth.
Traits Mount peculiarities indicate
If the Mount of Jupiter of a person is leaning towards the Mount of Saturn, he would be self-centered. Though they concentrate on efforts aimed at their own good, they would end as failures. Therefore, these subjects are often frustrated and disgruntled people. If the Mount is located in a lower position, the person would face slander and defame several times in his life. But he would make a success in literary pursuits.
If the Mount of Jupiter is absent on the palm of a person, he would have no regard for self-respect. He would not receive proper parental care and would prefer the company of uncouth persons.
Reading Mount of Jupiter with the shape of fingers
If the fingers are pointed and the Mount of Jupiter is well developed, the owner is superstitious. If the fingers are conical and the mount is normal, he would demonstrate pride in actions in everyday life. If the finger tips are square and the mount of Jupiter is very prominent, the owner would be full of vanity.
If the Mount of Jupiter and that of Saturn are well-developed and are intermingled, the owner is very fortunate and would gain great success in life.

Microfinance services have become an important tool as they start contributing to the economy by providing support to uplift and encourage specially women.

Present day women are recognized as an imperative catalyst in the economic rejuvenation, especially in developing countries. Thus NDB takes every effort to provide constant encouragement and propel financial guidance for Sri Lankan women with a determination to grow in their life.

Research on  Endolichenic Fungi Using living organisms to  combat cancer CELLS
	
	There are 30 lichen species and more than 200 endolichen fungi species associated with such mangroves
	
	
	This is the first time that a research of this kind is being carried out in Sri Lanka
	

By Gayan SURIYAARACHCHI
The Chemistry Department of the Kelaniya University has found that Endolichenic fungi that grows in Lichen of the vegetation in the wet zone has astounding properties that could help destroy cancer cells 
Lichen is a living organism found on tree trunks and rocks. The fungi that develop and grow freely on the favourable background created by the cordial co-ordination of an algae and lichen is known as Endolichenic fungus. 
The researchers say they are also studying the antioxidant, antibiotic and anti-inflammatory properties of the substance. This research is being conducted under Senior Professor Sriyani Paranagama of the Chemistry Department of Kelaniya University. 
Prof. Paranagama is also known to have discovered that endolichen fungi are capable of developing bio-active compounds which are rich with medicinal properties, during a research carried out jointly with Professor Lesley Gunathilaka of the University of Arizona. 
This is the first time that a research of this kind is being carried out in Sri Lanka. The National Research Council provided the financial contribution for the research, Prof. Paranagama said.

"As another stage of this research, we started to identify various compounds that are created and to identify the endolichen fungi species found in the mangrove environment"
The process of extracting from endolichen fungus is a result of the modern research work discovered through a programme to produce new medicinal compounds. Almost all medicine we use has its origins in properties found in flora, algae or aquatic organisms. Vincristine medicine often prescribed for cancer patients are produced from a certain flower (mineemal). The method of extracting medicinal properties from plants started with the discovery of Penicillin. The research reveals that bio-active constituents can be produced in the endolichen fungus that lives independently within the lichen found in the trees of the wet zone. It has been proved that the constituents are available in endolichen fungus that has not been identified so far, anywhere else in the world. 
We started to cultivate endolichen fungus separately in our laboratory from lichen collected from the trees in Sinharaja, Haggala and Knuckles forests. We are trying to find out whether there is an anti-oxidant, cancer destruction quality in these constituents. We believe that we could develop and cultivate these properties or even develop them through synthesis process, by finding out constituents that could be used very successfully, Prof. Paranagama said.

As another stage of this research, we started to identify various compounds that are created and to identify the endolichen fungi species found in the mangrove environment. We believe that there are unidentified constituents in such species in endolichen fungi that have adapted in the same way that the mangroves have, according to arid environments. Usually mangroves grow in environments with a high concentration of salt . So far, it has been identified that there are 30 lichen species and more than 200 endolichen fungi species associated with such mangroves. 
Dr. (Mrs) Gothami Weerakoon, from the University of Chicago, USA has assisted the botanical identification of the lichen species that have been collected from this research. Dr. Renuka Attanayaka of the University of Kelaniya is meanwhile involved in identifying the endolichen fungus, Prof. Paranagama said.

Rs.360mn sought to purchase ministers vehicles
	
A supplementary estimate to seek Parliament's approval to spend more than Rs.360 million to purchase vehicles for some ministers and renovate official residences of several other ministers was presented to Parliament today.
Accordingly, approval was sought to spend Rs. 154 million to purchase new vehicles for the Ministry of Defence which is under President Maithripala Sirisena while Rs. 120 million was sought to purchase vehicles for the Finance Ministry.
Approval was also sought to spend Rs.43 million to purchase a vehicle for the Deputy Minister of Rural Economy and Rs. 16 million to purchase a vehicle for the Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade.
The notes of the supplementary estimate said funds that were allocated for the purchase of vehicle in 2016 but remains unutilized will be used. 
In addition Rs.3.4 million was sought for the repairs of the official residence of Social Empowerment and Social Welfare Minister, Rs.1.2 million for the repairs of the official residence of Digital Infrastructure Development Minister and Rs.5.9 million for the renovation of Central Province Governor's official residence.

## Title: The Olcottisation of Project Gotabaya

The Olcottisation of Project Gotabaya
	
The theosophical movement, as the likes of Nalin de Silva and Gunadasa Amarasekara have pointed out, was fixated on imitating the same colonialist hegemony its representatives were contending against. They derived considerably from the Protestant, Lutheran, and Wesleyan tradition, given since many of them were educated at Wesleyan missionary schools (Olcott himself was a Presbyterian). 
That the Buddhist Catechism was structured along the lines of Luthers Small Catechism is therefore not surprising: in the absence of a strong bilingual and rooted bourgeoisie, it was left to the urban Buddhist elite to salvage Buddhism from the pirivena to the British curriculum. Inherently this transformation was hybrid, neither here nor there. As later events show, it couldnt survive the Buddhist Commission of 1956, a document which was vilified by leading members of that same elite. 
All that is history of course. But history is a reminder. It crops up, sometimes in gushes, sometimes in bits and pieces, and finds other channels of venting out the anomalies of the past. The fact that Olcott Buddhism died down in 1956 didnt mean it couldnt be resurrected. It was more or less a structural flaw in a well-intentioned revivalist program. And it has found a way of venting itself out today in the rift, vaguely discernible but very much present nevertheless, in our nationalist movement. 


The Sinhala Only pamphleteers of 1956 found their leader in an incongruous figure. S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike was primarily a product of Western liberal humanism, though he was streets ahead of the Marxists and the Olcott Buddhists in trying to attain a Buddhist utopia. What he failed to realise, however, was that there are no Buddhist utopias. Buddhism has no place for a secular paradise. The Sinhala people have no place for a secular paradise. In Bandaranaikes writings, copious as they are, one can infer a sensibility that rebels against this fundamental line of thinking. 
His nationalism was largely derived from two sources: the Bengali renaissance and Western liberalism. Being neither a Tagore nor a Henry Wallace (whose exhortation of the age of the common man became a refrain in his programme), however, he was to say the least an ideological parvenu to what transpired in 1956. Such an incongruity finds an equivalent today in Gotabaya Rajapaksa. With a caveat: Bandaranaike was the messiah figure for the Sinhala and Dharmapala Buddhists, while Rajapaksa represents a similar figure for the Protestant and Olcottised Buddhists. 
Project Gotabaya isnt a term I came up with: Hafeel Farisz coined it. In it one can infer the ideological, self-contradictions at the heart of the professional nationalist electorate. This electorate continues to be sustained by the urban middle-class. Its no surprise that one of the reasons for the rift in the Sihala Urumaya between the Champika Ranawaka and the S. L. Gunasekera factions was the series of victories gained by the former over the latter in areas such as Borella, Maharagama, Dehiwela, and Kotte, areas which housed the same young, professional, and middle-class electorate that would empower and back the later Hela Urumaya. 
This class has essentially bifurcated now, between an Old Guard and a New Guard. The Old Guard comprises of the Hela Urumaya. The New Guard comprises of those who hedge their bets for 2020 on Gotabaya Rajapaksa. The reason for that is owing to the mans popular image as a technocrat: in particular, his stint at the Urban Development Authority, the same Authority Ranawaka is in charge of now. 


"S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike was primarily a product of Western liberal humanism, though he was streets ahead of the Marxists and the Olcott Buddhists in trying to attain a Buddhist utopia. What he failed to realise, however, was that there are no Buddhist utopias. Buddhism has no place for a secular paradise"

But Gotabaya Rajapaksa is as much the technocrat as his brothers, which isnt saying much really. Its a classic case of a movement being led by a man whos ideologically distant from some of the tenets espoused by its representatives. In a similar vein, those who lead Project Gotabaya are not just distant from but also opposed to the other major faction in the nationalist movement (led by firebrands like Gevindu Cumaratunga, Elle Gunawansha Thera, and Manohara de Silva). The best way to draw up a contrast between these two is by resorting to the primary focus of each: while Project Gotabaya is centred more on economics, on numbers, the Cumaratunga-Gunawansha nexus (which includes the Yuthukama Sanwada Kawaya) is centred more on slogans, on protest symbols. Basically, its reason versus rhetoric. 
Project Gotabaya is on that count an extrapolation of what Dayan Jayatilleka referred to as smart patriotism: the kind of patriotism that subsists on nationalism and internationalism (Dr. Dayan compares it to Fidel Castros ideology: Internationalism isnt just a necessity... its a condition for survival). Gevindus movement, on the other hand, is housed by the likes of Nalin de Silva and Gunadasa Amarasekera. For obvious reasons, these two dont see eye to eye. Not too difficult to figure out why. 


The professional nationalists who back Rajapaksa are for the most renegades. They are also modernists. Unlike de Silva, Amarasekara, and Cumaratunga, they are not opposed to Western paradigms of development. They are against the UNP, but not the technocratic thrust that defines the UNP. In trying to market technocracy to the nationalist, they concomitantly reject and pander to populism: roughly the same ideological schizophrenia exhibited by the Olcott Buddhists. They openly spurn cosmopolitanism, but in spurning it they end up emulating it in a different way. In place of a figurehead like Razeen Sally (with his libertarian streak), to give just one example, they promote Howard Nicholas (with his Keynesian undertones). 
Should we worry, however I dont think so. They are needed. Not because they will uplift the grassroots movement here, but because in acting as a Third Force between the regime and the anti-regime, they are serving a purpose: market the tools of the cosmopolitan to the nationalist. Which brings me to another point. 


People have written on Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Some see in him a messiah. Others see in him an autocrat. The congruence of messiah figure and autocrat has led to the popular image of the man as a placid administrator, the kind of administrator Project Gotabaya conceptualises him as. The Jathika Chinthanaya, which houses Gevindu, is not interested in personalities like that. It is more interested in perpetuating ideas. 
For me, this simultaneously personality-driven and idea-driven thrust of our nationalist resurgence is commendable and comforting. There can be clashes, there can be rifts, but owing to the lack of a cohesive grassroots campaign here, its consoling that one of our nationalist movements is campaigning from the premise that to combat the enemy, one must emulate what underpins the enemy. 
By that I am not thinking of parties or people alone, of course. I am thinking about ideologies. Patently anti-democratic, anti-nationalist ideologies. All of them skewed against Sinhala Buddhists. If it takes a smart patriot (what does that make other patriots though, I wonder) to undo or question them, as citizens we theoretically shouldnt be having problems. Are there problems in the first place Strictly speaking, yes. But we shouldnt be worrying about them. At least not now.

Police scrambled to close down a network around the Manchester suicide bomber with arrests in Britain and Tripoli on Wednesday, as details about the investigation were leaked to U.S. media, infuriating authorities who fear a second attack is imminent. 
British-born Salman Abedi, 22, who was known to security services, killed 22 people at a concert venue packed with children on Monday. 
Authorities believe he had help in building the bomb, which photographs published by the New York Times showed was sophisticated and powerful, and that his accomplices could be ready to strike again.
