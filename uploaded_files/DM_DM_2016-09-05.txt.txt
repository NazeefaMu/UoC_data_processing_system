This machine also accepts cardless deposits made by ATM cards or fund transfers made by simply keying debit account and the credit account numbers as per instruction displayed on CDMs graphic screen. Currently the maximum deposit value using an ATM Card for a customers own account is set to Rs.1 million and cash deposits to ones own account or third party is set to Rs.200,000/-. Coming up with innovative ways and means to enrich the lives of the banks diverse customer base, the Bank looks forward to extend this facility further within the branch network that is spread across the country. 
Operating these CDMs is made easy as all simple steps that need to be followed are displayed on the machines graphic screen guiding the customer step by step till the end of the process. Customers will receive a detailed mini-statement once the transaction is completed. If customers prefer to make the transaction completely paperless this CDM gives the customer the opportunity to activate an SMS alert to be received to a given mobile number.
Being Bankers to the Nation, we at BOC take pride in assisting our fellow Sri Lankans from all walks of life to fulfill their aspirations by providing them the best and most convenient financial solutions.

CA Sri Lanka, along with its Public Sector Wing (APFASL), is organising an international seminar on accrual accounting and implementation of International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) as part of the South Asian Federation of Accountants (SAFA) events with the assistance from the World Bank in November this year.
This seminar will be held along with the board meeting and committee meetings of the SAFA, which is scheduled to be held in Colombo from November 3 to

The seminar will also be an important platform for the SAFA member bodies to share knowledge and experiences of the countries in the region, enabling to outline a plan for shifting from cash-based accounting system to accrual-based accounting system and make recommendation for implementation of Financial Reporting in compliance with Public Sector Accounting Standards in the region. The World Bank along with the SAFA is undertaking a comparative study on Enhancing Public Sector Financial Reporting in the South Asia Region (SAR) and the seminar is expected to focus on the outcome of the study at the seminar. The APFASL was established as the Public Sector Wing of CA Sri Lanka with the objective of bringing together public sector accountants, auditors and assessors to improve their professional skills and expertise, in an effort to enhance the public financial management practices in the country. 
In 2015, the APFASL was instrumental in introducing the Chartered Public Finance Accountancy (CPFA) qualification for the public sector with the support of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance & Accountancy (CIPFA) London. The initial membership is offered on a merit basis to around 100 members of the Public Sector Wing considering their qualifications in the field of financial management as a mark of recognition of their long services in the public sector to encourage them to work together and promote professionalism within the sector. For this purpose, applications will be invited from the members of the APFASL who meet the criteria specified in the enrolment form, by obtaining the same from the institutes website or by calling over personally at the office of the APFASL at CA Sri Lanka, Colombo 7. Meanwhile, in an effort to further enhance financial reporting in the public sector, the APFASL together with the Finance Ministry published 10 public sector accounting standards, in two volumes. Another 10 standards are being deliberated for adoption and publication before end-2016.
APFASL is also conducting a series of training programmes as a capacity building measure on various subjects relating to public financial management based on a prospectus published for this purpose. A number of facilitation programmes have been conducted in this regard to facilitate accrual accounting and implementation of Sri Lanka Public Sector Accounting Standards. The APFASL has also taken steps to organise the Best Annual Reports and Accounts Awards Competition for the public sector. The competition aims to recognize excellence in financial reporting among the public sector institutions in the country and applications have been invited for the inaugural competition, which will be held in September this year. Taking into consideration the developments taking place in Sri Lanka, in particular in relation to financial reporting and the introduction of the Public Sector Accounting Standards based on IPSAS, the SAFA board entrusted the APFASL to organise the seminar, which aims to create awareness on the significance of accrual-based accounting and implementation to Public Sector Accounting Standards in an effort to promote excellence in Financial reporting in the public sector in the SAFA region.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday the government was working towards introducing a pay hike to the working class, and also to provide employment opportunities to the youth.
Addressing the UNP membership drive and the appointment of the Youth Bala Mandala in Biyagama yesterday, he said the government would provide employment opportunities to the youth through 50 industrial zones in the country.
We will set up new industrial zones in Colombo, Hambantota, Wellawaya, Kandy, Mawathagama, Kuliyapitiya, Divulapitiya, Horana, Avissawella and Matara areas." he said.
Meanwhile, the Premier stated that the UNP, which will celebrate its 70th anniversary, would adopt the concept of its late leader J.R. Jayewardene as its future strategy.
Late J.R. Jayewardene rallied the youth and gave them a place in the party. I was one of them. He appointed me as the Biyagama Organiser. He advised me to look for means to develop the area, for which I suggested that he set up an industrial zone in Biyagama, like the one in Katunayake.
However, it did not remain as a mere suggestion, but was materialized. Thus, Biyagama was developed," he said.
Mr. Wickremesinghe added that it was the duty of the present Biyagama Organiser Ruwan Wijewardene to find channels to bring in IT developments to the area and ensure further expansion.

Launch of Life Insurance Awareness Month  1st to 30th September
	
In an effort to increase awareness regarding the value of life insurance, the Insurance Association of Sri Lanka (IASL) in partnership with the Insurance Board of Sri Lanka (IBSL) has for the 2nd consecutive year declared the month of September as Life Insurance Awareness Month.
The life insurance market is highly under-penetrated with total life insurance premium to gross domestic product ratio standing at only 0.48 percent in 2015 (source: 2015 IBSL Annual Report). According to statistics only 35 percent of Sri Lankas working population (13 percent of the total population) enjoy the luxury of life insurance.  Hence themain purpose of the life insurance awareness campaign is to increase the level of insurance penetration in the country. Industry leaders expect that the September 2016 campaign will build on the momentum achieved in the previous year and help promote insurance across all parts of Sri Lanka.
Aggressive campaigns will be conducted island wide by all insurers promoting the value of life insurance from 1st to 30th September.  The IASL and IBSL have also planned many communication platforms to reach potential customers. These include radio and print as well as digital and social media campaigns. As done previously a competition has been launched amongst insurance sales advisors and sales professionals who will be rewarded / recognized at a special ceremony following the life insurance awareness month.

Sri Lankan maid enslaved by Malaysian couple in US: lawsuit
	
A Malaysian diplomat and his wife in New York, US had treated a Sri Lankan national virtually as a slave, making her work 15-plus hours a day for no more than $1.71 per hour, New York Post reported on Sunday.
The couple, Arasi Krishnan and Danish Kumar, forbade Parimaladevi Jeganathan from leaving their apartment and warned her that if she did, black people would do something to her, the Manhattan federal lawsuit claims.
It was pretty clear that she was their servant. She wasnt allowed to leave the house except to sometimes accompany the family to church, said Anne Li, Jeganathans lawyer.
Jeganathan started working for the couple in Malaysia in 2013. In March of that year, she arrived in the US on an A-3 visa granted to diplomats relatives and household employees, court papers state.
The US State Department listed Krishnan as a consul at the Malaysian consulate on East 43rd Street.
Jeganathan believed that while working for the couple as a do-it-all domestic helper, she was monitored by their buildings doorman and by Malaysian consulate security guards.
She was fearful of venturing outside alone, the lawsuit says.
Early in 2014, Krishnan had told Jeganathan her visa had expired and it was too expensive to renew. Krishnan said that if Jeganathan didnt agree to work for her for another 3/2 years, shed be forced to return to war-ravaged Sri Lanka. She was frightened and worried for her family, Li said.
Jeganathan, realizing her plight, contacted the FBI. Agents took her from the apartment on March 6, 2014.
Jeganathan now lives in the city in a charity-funded safe house, said Li. The federal lawsuit accuses Krishnan and Kumar of violating laws designed to protect victims of human trafficking.
No criminal charges have been filed against the couple, who are back in Malaysia, Li said.
