B?desh central bank lauds Pan Asia Bank for preventing world?s largest bank heist
	
Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC, Sri Lanka?s fastest growing commercial bank, last week received praise from the topmost official of the Bangladesh central bank for the foremost role the bank played in preventing in what could have been the world?s biggest bank robbery in history.?
In February 2016, the unidentified hackers breached Bangladesh Bank?s systems and stole its credentials for payment transfers. The hackers then bombarded the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with nearly three dozen requests to move money from Bangladesh Bank?s account held at the Fed to entities in the Philippines and Sri Lanka.
While four such requests by the hackers to transfer a total of US $ 81 million to the Philippines went through, the fifth amounted to US $ 20 million sent to Shalika Foundation ? a non-governmental organisation (NGO) ? reached through Pan Asia Bank was held up due to the extreme cautiousness followed by the latter at all times as the nature of the transaction was suspicious.?
Pan Asia Bank then alerted the necessary authorities about the suspicious fund transfer, which then transpired as part of the bigger hacking involving the Bangladesh central bank. ? ?
This extreme vigilance of the bank enabled Pan Asia Bank to prevent a nearly US $ 1 billion in transfers into different parts of the world by these hackers of moneys belonging to the Bangladesh central bank and New York Fed last year.
In appreciation of this central role played by Pan Asia Bank, Bangladesh Bank Governor Fazle Kabir, who was in Sri Lanka last week, met with Pan Asia Bank Chief Executive Officer Nimal Tillekeratne at the Central Bank to commend the bank and its employees for their role, which helped them to uncover a web of similar hacks involving its central bank. ?
Pan Asia Bank will continue to play its national role as a responsible bank by being on alert at all times to ensure that suspicious transactions carried out at the expense of national interests are reported and brought to the attention of the enforcement agencies. ??
Further, as the custodian of the hard-earned moneys of the people, Pan Asia Bank always takes utmost caution when handling moneys and ensures that no activity, which could compromise the safety of the moneys of its customers, is condoned.?
Bangladesh Bank Governor Fazle Kabir presents a token of appreciation to Pan Asia Bank Director/Chief Executive Officer Nimal Tillekeratne in the presence of AGM Operations and Credit Administration Harsha Kurukulasuriya and Acting Manager Central Operations Dilrukshi Guruge
For this purpose, the bank continuously invests on training and development of its highly skilled staff, update its systems to their latest versions and streamline its processes because for Pan Asia Bank, the security of the funds of its customers is a topmost priority. ??

White collar ones attached to a state establishment handling an important function related to facts and figures are being sent in ten-member batches to Malaysia for training when there is a training centre for them located in a gem-rich district, they say.

However, when it comes to picking the ?boys? for the training programme in Malaysia, this high-up is reportedly giving preference to his own favourites, some of them are on the verge of retirement while some others are very junior ones counting one or two years of service.

## Title: Glyphosate Weed killer now destroys health in the plantations!

Glyphosate Weed killer now destroys health in the plantations!
	
Should the govt ban it or not?
Glyphosate is back in the spotlight. The herbicide and the active ingredient in globally used weed killers, was banned on June 11, 2015 owing to findings linking the chemical with kidney disease in Sri Lanka. In September 2016 Minister of Plantation Industries Navin Dissanayake called for re-import of the chemical citing the needs of the ailing plantations industry. Almost one year later, the Minister who once insisted that the ban won?t be lifted, is now reportedly seeking cabinet approval to lift it. ??
800,000 litres of the chemical will be imported with a 15 percent reduction of import volumes each year
	The issues experienced by the plantations industry weren?t caused by this chemical ban
Reports revealed that Minister Dissanayake called for the ban to be lifted as commercial agriculture has suffered great losses since the ban was implemented. Minister Dissanayake earlier said that he only wishes for an exemption for the tea plantations to be granted, where only 800,000 litres of the chemical will be imported with a 15 percent reduction of import volumes each year. When the Daily Mirror attempted to contact Minister Dissanayake to make clarifications, the Minister said that he doesn?t wish to comment on the issue adding, ?Enough has been said on the matter?. ?
Our farmers have been cultivating rice for years, but at the same time are suffering from malnutrition
Meanwhile the People?s Planning National Forum, a collective of activists campaigning against this attempt, convened a media briefing recently to illustrate the consequences of the chemical being re-imported. The organisation comprises activists and members from the farming association across the country, intellectuals of varied expertise, including university lecturers and researchers. The team represents members who have dedicated to develop the agriculture industry over the past 20 to 25 years. ??
?We condemn govt?s duplicity?
Speaking on the Glyphosate issue, Chintaka Rajapakse of the Movement for Land and Agricultural Reform elaborated on duplicity of government policies. ?Since November 2016, a ten member Cabinet committee was appointed to review the import ban on Glyphosate. ??
The committee submitted their recommendations to the ministers recently while the subject Minister Navin Dissanayake is expected to present a Cabinet paper to relax the ban. Efforts are already underway to import the disastrous chemical again,? Rajapakse said. ?
?The issues experienced by the plantations industry weren?t caused by this chemical ban. They were due to issues in administration and management. Glyphosate is now being used as a means to cover the real problem, without addressing the underlying issues. At this time, there are several corporates involved with this issue, along with some scientists and researchers who advocate the use of Glyphosate. This fund driven exercise is now attempting to change perceptions regarding this dangerous herbicide. This has been carefully planned and implemented by multinational organisations such as Monsanto and Bayer.? ??
According to Rajapakse, Professor of Ecological Agriculture P.I. Yapa, of Sabaragamuwa University, the only professor in the subject, has made clear recommendations, where it states that Glyphosate shouldn?t be banned. ?However he said that recommendations were stated before a final discussion on the committee. The government has no right to lift this ban citing the issues of the plantation sector. There are plenty of alternatives they can consider. Instead they have resorted to lift the ban and import this deadly chemical once again, based on the needs of a few. We condemn this move while ?questioning the government of their duplicity. The government is attempting to change the farming patterns of the country. Attempts to reverse this ban clearly showcase the ambivalence of this government. We request the President to discourage these attempts and seek alternatives for the resolution of these problems,? he said. ??
?Farmers suffer due to chemicals?
Terrence Gamini - An activist representing the farmers of the North Central Province strongly believes that Glyphosate has been associated with a number of ailments including Chronic Kidney Disease of unknown etiology (CKDu). ?Farmers have long been entrusted with the duty of making this island self-sufficient, especially regarding rice. For the past two seasons, farmers couldn?t cultivate, mostly because of the absence of rainfall and water. However the low yield was portrayed as a result of not using the chemical Glyphosate. There was a severe dry spell which affected all crop plantations. People with vested interests are trying to use this as an excuse to import the chemical,? Gamini said. ??
?Our farmers have been cultivating rice for years, but at the same time are suffering from malnutrition. This is because they cannot cover the production cost with the profits. They sell their rice for Rs. 30 or 25 and are forced to buy imported rice from a shop along with Mysore Dhal and Soya Bean. This is a farmer?s diet now. Glyphosate has been used to destroy the natural greenery in our fields. It?s a chemical that leaves no weed or plant behind. A farmer?s malnutrition is directly caused by the use of this chemical. Earlier cultivators consumed green leaves such as gotukola and mukunuwenna which used to grow in their fields. But these plants have been destroyed by the use of Glyphosate and farmers no longer consume them,? Gamini lamented. ??
?During the short time the ban was implemented, cultivators quickly adapted to farming without this chemical. Every farmer now has equipment necessary for weeding. It also saves all the insects and harmless creatures that live within the soil. The scientists who carry out research on renal diseases have pointed out that the use of agro-chemicals has contributed to kidney disease plaguing many parts of the country. This chemical is responsible for the change in our food patterns which leads to diseases that have rendered our farmers helpless. All agro-chemicals should be banned for this reason alone, however we stress on the need to prohibit Glyphosate as it is the most used agro-chemical by our farmers. We have years of experience in cultivating so we can identify the nature of the soil. We condemn all attempts to bring back chemicals under false pretences,? charged Gamini. ?
?Govt needs an alternative plan?
Speaking at the event, Buddhi Jayasuriya, an activist with over 35 years in of service in the state plantations corporation and expertise in plantation crops including tea and coconut, said the estate sector is experiencing a crisis, economically, socially and environmentally. ?Economically tea plantations are no longer profitable. The local as well as the international demand for tea is low and this won?t change. Some 20 tea production companies involved in this business, on average face a loss of Rs. 57 with every kilogram of tea sold. When it comes to state plantations, they face a loss of Rs. 84 for a kilo of tea. These are the circumstances under which the tea plantation operates,? said Jayasuriya elaborating on the conditions present in the plantation sector. ??
?Sri Lanka also competes against Kenya, India and other emerging tea producers in Vietnam and Africa. However the market for the volumes of tea is limited and therefore won?t see demand increase. The tea plantations receive only 7 percent of the profits. 50 percent of profits go to intermediaries in the value chain, such as those involved in manufacturing, packaging and transport,? he said. ??
?Tea plantations were managed under the mono-crop concept for over 100 years. This is the root cause of all issues. The prolonged existence of a single crop in a given land area, with no other weed or natural insect inhabiting the place, is against nature and changes the ecological balance. This is why we need agrochemicals and fertiliser. Glyphosate can kill underground parts of many constant weeds when sprayed on the foliage. It?s used to eradicate infestations in tea fields. When uprooting and replanting, approximately 40 tons of soil are washed away due to the chemical?s reaction on the soil.? ??
?Not only does this destroy our eco-system, but it also changes our plantation and food patterns, as they are increasingly dependent on agrochemicals. With or without Glyphosate, the plantation industry is heading for disaster, but lifting the ban isn?t the solution. The root causes must be addressed,? Jayasuriya stressed. ?
We must pose the question whether the reversal of this ban is the only alternative
?Moreover the estate population of the country suffers from undernourishment, unsatisfactory levels of education and numerous other social problems. Their lives can be uplifted only through the plantation sector. The government needs an alternative plan to reform agricultural practices and uplift the livelihood of people in ?the hill country. Authorities must take responsibility and not resort to such trivial responses,? he opined. ?
?Address our needs first?
T. Ganeshalingam of the People?s Movement for Plantation Land Rights also speaking at the event echoed the facts underscored by Jayasuriya. ?Over the past 15 to 20 years, Glyphosate was used in the tea plantations. Before the plantations were handed over to companies in 1992, tea was a profitable business. Today it?s running at a loss. Minister Navin Dissanayaka discards the claims that Glyphosate is linked with kidney disease. However we have information of people who have fallen victim to this disease in all estates. We even have the details of the Grama Seva Niladharis who are responsible for families with such patients,? Ganeshalingam revealed. ??
?The number of people suffering from malnutrition in our estates is on the rise. The EPF and ETF payments haven?t been made to the workers. An estate sector with such glaring issues can?t be made profitable with the use of a harmful chemical. There has been no evidence to suggest that the use of Glyphosate will contribute to profits. All these chemicals reach our waterways and the entire water network is polluted. Thus we request the government to solve issues in the estate sector instead of lifting this ban and aggravating our problems further,? he stressed. ??
According to the government there?s no substantial evidence that the herbicide is linked to CKDu. There are many who beg to differ. They also believe that Glyphosate is carcinogenic. This understandable because the government?s attempts to save an already plagued plantation sector.We must pose the question whether the reversal of this ban is the only alternative? It must be noted that Sri Lanka has had an inclination towards introducing ?bans?, but its effectiveness remains questionable. While officials have stressed that if the reversal is implemented, the chemical should be imported only under strictly supervised conditions, Sri Lanka doesn?t have a reputation for maintaining effective regulations. The Tea Research Institute is reportedly looking into introducing an organic weedicide for tea plantations. The overall health of cultivators and their families certainly can?t be compromised upon the needs of a particular sector. ?

Govt. to take vital decisions to face changes
	
Highlighting the fact that Sri Lanka was being affected by changes in global weather patterns, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today the government would have to take important decisions to face this situation.
He told those who had gathered at a ceremony at Temple Trees where bowsers were distributed to drought-stricken districts that Sri Lanka?s economy would have to be adjusted to face such changes.
?The prevailing drought is not confined to Sri Lanka alone. It is being experienced in India, Bangladesh and in several other countries. Many experts including those from the UN had said global weather patterns are changing. It is a new phenomenon which Sri Lanka will also have to face. This is why President Sirisena signed the Paris agreement on behalf of the country. We would have to determine how we could adjust our economy to face these changes. The government has focused on this issue and will take important decisions in the coming months to face these changes. It is essential to think of the future generations and preserve the environment,? the Prime Minister said.
He said several districts were hit by the prolonged drought. ?We have faced droughts before but we will have to think whether this one is different to those we have experienced before,? the Prime Minister said. (Yohan Perera)

Heroes who?ll survive the sands of time
	
Janashakthi- National Civilian Bravery Awards 2017
When we were small, our minds were conditioned in such a way that as soon as the word ?hero? is mentioned, elegant figures wearing capes and fancy clothes swooping out of the sky and saving the day come to our minds. But what most of us don?t realize is that heroes who don?t wear capes, who are set apart from the rest of the humanity only by their selflessness and bravery, walk among us even now. While millions of people go through the everyday motions of their lives, that handful of people make heroic sacrifices to ensure the well-being of others disregarding their own, sometimes putting their own lives at risk in the process. ??
Fifteenth of June saw a group of such people, from all over the country, assemble into Nelum Pokuna Theatre for the Civilian Bravery awards 2017. Awards were given under three categories; National Civilian Bravery Awards, Civilian Bravery Philanthropy Awards and Civillian Bravery Fauna/Flora Awards.
Eranga cared little about his life?
All animals including humans are programmed in a way that they usually value their lives beyond everything else. Whenever their lives are threatened, they rely on instinct and do all they can to save themselves. Eranga Wikumsiri, an Economic Development Officer of the Aranayake Samasara Division, was attending a meeting held in his division when he heard about the landslide of the Samasara Kanda. He along with his brother went against their ingrained instinct for survival. They braved the mouth of the devil and went from house to house in the risk area, notifying the residents of the impending doom. The brothers were tirelessly helping people evacuate the area when the second landslide struck. Eranga along with his brother was swallowed up by the torrent of earth. Even though Eranga will never reunite with his wife and his little son, more than sixty families continue to see the light of day thanks to his courageous actions. Eranga?s post-humus Gold Civilian Bravery Award, for the incredible feat of saving lives of the others at the cost of his own life, was received by his wife at the ceremony. ??
An Aircraftsman?s?diving feat?
Naveen Dhanushka Bandara, a young aircraftman at the Air Force Base in Batticaloa, was walking to town when he saw a crowd gathered around an area of the Batticaloa lagoon. On making inquiries, he learned that a three-wheeler with four passengers had been driven onto the lagoon and was underwater. Not a single person in the crowd wanted to brave the water, which was notorious for being infested with crocodiles. The warrior who made the sky his battle ground, bravely waded into unfamiliar waters. He ignored the grave danger to his own life in diving into the murky lagoon-hiding deadly creatures in it?s depth-in search of the lives of four unknown people. The muddy water clouded his vision, leaving him grasping in the deep waters. He was able to grab hold of a child during his first attempt. He dived again and again, each time carrying another life to safety. He saved a woman and another child. On his third attempt, responding to shouts from the crowd that there was another one left, he dived back immediately, even though he was beyond exhaustion. He recalls the tightening sensation in his lungs while he was diving and the feeling of impending death with each stroke of his limbs. He grabbed the last victim by the hair and swam ashore with the last bit of energy he possessed. Only then did Naveen realize that the lady was pregnant and that he had saved two lives instead of one!
His heroic feats didn?t end there. He confesses that most of the crowd was only interested in videotaping and photographing the event, not in offering help. This sums up the ugly side of today?s society in one sentence. Therefore, Navin, dripping with water and clad only in a pair of briefs, accompanied the victims to the nearby hospital in a vehicle. He left the hospital wearing a towel that the staff gave him after admitting the patients
The witty security officer
Saman Rohitha Jayasinghe, who worked as a security officer in a bank in Katukurunda had just had his lunch when he noted two people wearing helmets and jackets in the parking lot. Even though it?s not unusual for people to enter the bank wearing jackets, he instinctively knew that something wasn?t right. So he returned to his post just in time to see one of them taking out a T56 and fire at him. Saman, dodging the bullets, rang the alarm and fired back at them with his rifle. The would be thieves whose plans of instant richness, with other people?s hard earned money, were ruined by the quick thinking of Saman. The thieves fled on their bike. Saman, whose instincts were honed by his years of working at the Air Force, was able to identify another suspicious person lurking inside the bank at the time of this incident. This person on questioning admitted that he was an accomplice of the thieves. Saman saved the reputation of his work place, preventing the bank from incurring a huge monetary loss. He was concerned about the impending risk to the life of his fellow workers and the customers inside of the bank. He helped avoid a massive disaster using his quick wit and by exploding into action.
? ?
Ten heroes including Naveen and Saman received Civillian Bravery Silver awards at the function for their bravery and dedication shown while going above and beyond the boundaries of duty to safeguard the lives of the others. ??
Kapurubanda gave all he had?
The landslide in Aranayake Samasara Kanda was a tragedy that melted the hearts of many Sri Lankans. E.M.Kapurubanda was one such person, but rather confining his sympathy to words, he wanted to contribute in any way he could to those whose lives that were upturned due to the tragedy. He decided to donate his land consisting of three acres so that houses could be built for the people who lost their homes. Now 15 new homes are built on the land that used to be his. At a time when the family members go against each other for a few perches of land, the generous act of Kapurubanda won him the Civillian Philanthropy award. ??
Rewarded five and a half decades later?
This year, in addition to the Budal Na Golden Award, a special bravery appreciation medal, a concept by Hon. Karu Jayasooriya, was awarded to Wijenamage Magilin Nona. It was the year 1961 and a group of children, in which she was a member, were crossing the cross over above the Diyagama Ela. Suddenly the log split part, causing the children on it to fall in to the rowdy waters below. Magilin Nona, a young lass at the time, even after being seriously injured on one foot during the incident, managed to save seven lives, three were her own younger siblings. Her brave actions were commemorated with deafening applause when she took to the stage to receive the award, five and a half decades after the event. ??
Awards were given under three categories; National Civilian Bravery Awards, Civilian Bravery Philanthropy Awards and Civillian Bravery Fauna/Flora Awards
Special guests
The National Civillian Bravery Awards, a concept born in the mind of Mr. Kasun Chandrarathne, President of the Foundation of Civilian Bravery Sri Lanka, was held for the 23rd time this year. The event was partnered by Janashakthi Insurance, with Wijeya Newspapers contributing as the sole printed media partner. Karu Jayasuriya, the Speaker of the Parliament, was the chief guest at the ceremony. Many other distinguished guests including State Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardene, Bryce Hutchinson, Australian High Commissioner in Sri Lanka, and the Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundare graced the event as special invitees.?

HRW calls on Canada to expedite Snowden-Linked asylum cases
	
The Canadian government should fast-track its consideration of the refugee claims of seven people, including the Sri Lankan family, who sheltered US National Security Agency whistle-blower Edward Snowden before he left Hong Kong in 2013, the Human Rights Watch reported yesterday.
The Hong Kong government has sent the adult asylum seekers detention notices, indicating that they could soon be deported to countries where they would face a credible risk of persecution and abuse. Their very young children face possible persecution if returned, or separation from their parents if the adults are detained and deported.
?The compassionate act of letting Edward Snowden into their homes should never have landed these families in peril,? said Dinah PoKempner, general counsel at Human Rights Watch. ?Hong Kong has failed to protect these families, who fear being returned to abusers who await them in the countries they fled, where they say they were persecuted and tortured.?
Prior to boarding the flight that ultimately stranded him in Russia, Snowden hid among others who sought asylum in Hong Kong, and was introduced to these families by their mutual lawyer, Robert Tibbo. The families hosted Snowden for short periods. They have said they willingly helped the young man who, like themselves, was seeking safety as a refugee. A US demand for his arrest in Hong Kong was not recognized and disclosed until after he had lawfully left the territory.
Hong Kong for years has accepted exceptionally few refugees, fewer than one percent of claims. Because of the considerable risk they could be returned, the asylum seekers who helped Snowden have also sought protection from Canada, where they have been privately sponsored for refugee resettlement. The Canadian government is considering their cases, but has indicated through the consulate in Hong Kong that they are not expedited. The average waiting time for determinations on such applications is more than four years, ? far too long should Hong Kong seek their prompt deportation to their home countries.
Each of the adults who sheltered Snowden ? a single man, a couple with two children, presently aged 5 and 1, and a single mother with a 5-year-old child ? allege that they experienced torture and ill-treatment in their home countries of Sri Lanka and the Philippines before fleeing to Hong Kong. The three children were born out of wedlock in Hong Kong and are stateless. Hong Kong does not recognize the family status of these parents and children, and if the parents are detained, there is a risk the children will be separated from them and placed in foster care, causing them further insecurity and trauma.
Although the asylum seekers and their lawyer kept their role secret, the director Oliver Stone depicted this episode in his movie Snowden, and reporters uncovered their identities and began seeking them out for interviews. At that point, they and their lawyer acknowledged their role and granted media interviews.
The publicity brought their plight to global attention, but appears to have led the Hong Kong government to move rapidly to detain and deport them after years of delay in hearing their asylum claims. There is no evidence that these families present any risk of flight, and they should not be separated from their children, Human Rights Watch said.
Once their connection with Snowden became known, the asylum seekers say, Hong Kong authorities repeatedly questioned them, to find out what they knew about Snowden, and denied them benefits for their basic living needs when they referred such questions to their lawyer.
Their situation became even more precarious when it was discovered that, in November and December 2016, Sri Lankan Criminal Investigation Department officers had been searching for several of them in Hong Kong, questioning other asylum seekers and showing them their photographs. The Hong Kong government did little to protect the asylum seekers in response and has not responded to expressions of concern for their safety by human rights groups, including Human Rights Watch.
The families are now preparing appeals to their rejection of asylum by the Hong Kong Immigration Department, which is currently trying to remove their lawyer from the cases.
?Canada should move quickly on these cases and safeguard these people from the prospect of detention and deportation,? PoKempner said. ?No one should have to risk return to torture or persecution because they opened their door to another who feared the same. Canada has a unique opportunity to provide these people and their children both safety and a future.?

## Title: IMF completes second review of the extended arrangement

IMF completes second review of the extended arrangement
	
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed the second review of Sri Lanka?s economic performance under the program supported by a three-year extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement.
Completion of the review enables the disbursement of the equivalent of SDR 119.894 million (about US$ 167.2 million), bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to the equivalent of SDR 359.682 million (about US$ 501.5 million), the IMF said today.
In completing the review, the Executive Board granted a waiver of nonobservance of the continuous performance criterion on accumulation of external arrears which was missed due to continued difficulties of establishing a payment platform and waivers of applicability of the performance criteria for end-June 2017 on floor of the central government primary balance and the program net official international reserves of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, given the unavailability of the information necessary to assess observance.
Sri Lanka?s three-year extended arrangement was approved on June 3, 2016 in the amount of about SDR 1.1 billion (US$1.45 billion, or 185 percent of quota in the IMF at that time of approval of the arrangement. See Press Release No. 16/262). The government?s reform program, supported by the IMF, aims to reduce the fiscal deficit, rebuild foreign exchange reserves, and introduce a simpler, more equitable tax system to restore macroeconomic stability and promote inclusive growth.
Following the Executive Board?s discussion of the review, Mr. Mitsuhiro Furusawa, Acting Chair and Deputy Managing Director, said:
?Sri Lanka?s performance under the Fund-supported program has been broadly satisfactory. Macroeconomic and financial conditions have been stable, despite severe weather events and global market volatility. The authorities launched fundamental income tax reform, undertook meaningful corrective actions to achieve program targets on international reserves, and remain committed to the reform program. Going forward, the reform momentum should strengthen further with greater ownership, building on the progress made so far.
?
?Fiscal performance has been strong. Targets for the fiscal balance and tax revenue have been met. The new Inland Revenue Act, which has been submitted to parliament, will support fiscal consolidation, make the tax system more efficient and equitable, and generate resources for social and development programs. Nevertheless, Sri Lanka?s high debt burden and gross financing needs require further revenue-based consolidation. Timely progress in structural reforms, including tax administration and energy pricing, will strengthen the platform for durable consolidation.
?Inflation and credit growth remain on the high side. While monetary policy was tightened in March, further tightening is desirable until clear signs emerge that inflation pressures and credit expansion have subsided. While financial soundness indicators remain stable, banks? capital adequacy ratio has declined due to rapid credit growth. Financial sector supervision should be strengthened, and macro-prudential measures could be deployed to rein in credit growth if needed.

Lankan cleared of charges in 19-year-old rape case
	
A Sri Lankan national charged with raping a young South Korean woman nearly two decades ago was acquitted by the top court on Tuesday, in the final twist of a long-drawn-out investigation into the cold case.
The Supreme Court upheld the not-guilty rulings by the lower courts on the 51-year-old foreigner, whose identity has been withheld, citing a lack of evidence.
"It is difficult to believe the veracity of their testimonies in light of objectivity and details of the statements," the top court said in the ruling.
The defendant was indicted in 2013 on charges of robbing and raping an 18-year-old college student, only identified by her last name Chung, in 1998. The belated indictment came as the DNA of the defendant, who was arrested for soliciting prostitution to a minor, was found to match that left on Chung's underwear. ?
Chung was found dead on Oct. 17, 1998, after being hit by a 25-ton dump truck on a highway in Daegu, some 302 kilometers southeast of Seoul. The police had suspected rape as they found her lingerie 30 meters away from the site of the accident, but concluded it was an accidental death.
In the fresh investigation, the prosecutors found that Chung jumped into the road as she ran away from her attackers in fear and had lost sense of direction in the dark.
The prosecutors indicted the Sri Lankan and two other accomplices of the same nationality on counts of special robbery and rape in 2013. It was about the only criminal charge they could lay against them since the statutes of limitation for rape and special rape in Korea are set at five years and 10 years, respectively.
The lower court and appeals court found the defendant not guilty, saying that the evidence was insufficient to prove the charges.
The prosecution managed to call a witness to the stand who testified that the defendant had told him in person about committing the rape. But the appeals court dismissed the testimony citing a lack of credibility.
The Sri Lankan will be extradited to his country as South Korea is bound by law to send back a foreign criminal who's been given a suspended sentence. He was convicted of sexually harassing a woman in 2013 and driving without a license a few years before that.
The two other accomplices in Chung's case were expelled from the country in the early 2000s due to the illegal stay. (Korea Herald)

NFTH never a Teaching Hospital: GMOA
	
The GMOA today charged that the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH) set up to provide clinical training to SAITM students had never functioned as a Teaching Hospital and not even as a Base Hospital.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Samantha Ananda said the government?s decision to direct SAITM students to State base hospitals shows that the NFTH had not fulfilled the minimum standards to function as a teaching hospital other than by name.
Dr. Ananda said the hospital was converted into a teaching hospital in one night, but no one knows how and on what basis that it had happened.
He said the people, civil society groups, trade unions and students unions including the GMOA had never asked the government to take over NFTH other than by Dr. Neville Fernando.
Dr. Ananda said Ministers Rajitha Senaratne and S.B. Dissanayake with NFTH founder Dr. Neville Fernando were benefited by sub-leasing the NFTH, resulting in aggravating the SAITM controversy without resolving it.
He said while misleading the public, both the ministers had found a way to settle the two billion loan taken by Dr. Fernando to establish the NFTH.
Meanwhile, GMOA Secretary Haritha Aluthge said the GMOA would complain to the United Nations Human Rights Commission over the government?s attempt to risk the lives of patients by establishing such a private institution under government sponsorship. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Police raid alleged 'tablet party'
	
A tense situation arose in Ja- Ela on Sunday (16) when some 300 individuals at a party and residents in the area were allegedly involved in a clash.
Sources said the individuals were at a party organized by a popular local artiste for a social media community.
Witnesses said that residents in the area had been angered by the loud music and misbehaviour of individuals who were under the influence of alcohol.
It is reported that residents had surrounded several individuals and attempted to beat them during the party and were only halted due to police intervention.
The Special Task Force (STF) and several police teams were summoned to control the situation, witnesses said.
A special search operation had also been conducted with sniffer dogs due to suspicions of drugs being used at the party. A high ranking police official later told the Daily Mirror that some cannabis had been found in the premises apart from alcohol, but no other drugs were found and no arrests were made.
Residents said that individuals had paid Rs. 3,500 as entrance fee for the party. (Thilanka Kanakarathna and PHV Perera)

Report: UAE behind hacking of Qatari media
	
?
The United Arab Emirates orchestrated the hacking of a Qatari government news site in May, planting a false story that was used as a pretext for the current crisis between Qatar and several Arab countries, according to a Sunday report by The Washington Post. ?
The Emirati Embassy in Washington released a statement in response calling the Post report ?false? and insisting that the UAE ?had no role whatsoever? in the alleged hacking. ? The report quotes unnamed U.S. intelligence officials as saying that senior members of the Emirati government discussed the plan on May 23. On the following day, a story appeared on the Qatari News Agency?s website quoting a speech by Qatar?s emir, Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad al-Thani, in which he allegedly praised Iran and said Qatar has a good relationship with Israel. Similarly incendiary statements appeared on the news agency?s Twitter feed. ? The agency quickly claimed it was hacked and removed the article. But Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt all blocked Qatari media and later severed diplomatic ties. In early June, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut ties with Qatar and moved to isolate the small, but wealthy Gulf nation, canceling air routes between their capitals and Qatar?s and closing their airspace to Qatari flights. ?

## Title: ?Royal Bookland? Getting us over a new leaf

?Royal Bookland? Getting us over a new leaf
	
Mrs Marini Fernando, who taught us in Grade Eight, was the best English teacher I ever had. She had that ability to inspire passion in us, particularly those of us who took to her period less for her lessons than the intricate ways in which she got us to love them. She was particular about dictionaries. I remember when we couldn?t guess the meaning of a particular word, she?d get us to peruse the Big Book. I can?t remember a time when we didn?t have it open. It was all part of her ramrod, but gentle-hearted nature. She could get us to do what she wanted, the way she wanted, without chastising us too much. ?
Looking back, I believe she was responsible for my subsequent passion for reading and writing, not least because she was behind various schemes in our school to improve our reading habit. She opened a class library, appointed library leaders, and lent us books from her personal collection. Because this was outside the syllabus, she didn?t emphasise on the dictionary: ?Just read through them carefully? was what she told us. Added to that was her weekly book report session, where she would make us write capsule reviews of the books we borrowed from the main library. ?
Whatever funds we raise, we plough back to refurbish and modernise it
Years later, when I discovered my love for writing, during that difficult period in our youth- when we don?t know what to do after we leave school and start looking for jobs- I credited her for having inspired me. I had always been an avid reader, having progressed through those inevitable stages we readers encounter, from Aesop and the Grimm Brothers to Enid Blyton and Richmal Crompton and to the Hardy Boys, Agatha Christie, and (as of now) everyone else. Reading helped me become a better writer. Writing helped me become a better reader. It worked both ways. I suppose that?s the greatest lesson Mrs Marini taught me. ?
Now it doesn?t take much time to read, but it takes a lot to create the love reading. Because of the effort entailed in it, we become lazy. Part of the reason for that, I think, is that we hang on to our textbooks so much that we don?t care about the worlds outside them; we think that everything we need to know is contained therein. This is a misconception as far as retaining and applying knowledge is concerned. We don?t visit our libraries enough, simply put. We should. Not because it?s a miracle cure, but because libraries are a good index of the way we think ahead, as a nation and a people. ?
The Library Readers Association (LRA) of Royal College is the oldest club in that school (established in 1846) and probably the only club of its kind in any school in the country. Age, however, hasn?t diminished its vitality, which is why it?s set to organise a series of events highlighting reading (and writing). Among them, their flagship project will be held on July 31 and August 1. Because these are no ordinary feel-good campaigns, I am interested. This piece is hence about that project, Royal Bookland. ?
True to its title, Bookland will feature an exhibition involving bookshops from across the country. But the LRA has been handling such exhibitions for the last few years. What?s special about it this time are two other events that are to be held alongside it; a quiz and a short story competition. The latter will be categorised according to language and age. Much of the history behind those two and the club can be rooted in a rather determined committee headed by two boys: Rajitha Abeysinghe (Chairman of the Organising Committee of Bookland) and Sanura Kulanaka (Chairman of the Association). I managed to talk with both. ?
I first spoke with Rajitha, rather he spoke to me. The decision to go beyond an exhibition this year, he explained, was based on LRA?s mission; to transform the Royal College Library into the leading institution of its kind in Sri Lanka, not just for its students, but also for their community. ?Whatever funds we raise, we plough back to refurbish and modernise it. However, we felt that it wasn?t enough. That is why we began organising a series of seminars, attended by leading writers.? ? Apparently the short story competition had been the result of one such seminar, held about three weeks ago during school hours. That seminar had been headed by Malinda Seneviratne and mooted by the Chairman of the LRA, Sanura Kulanaka, whom I spoke with. ?We organised it within three days. The important thing is that we didn?t force anyone to come. We just announced that students were welcome. In the end it had a turnout of 138 students, all of whom were entranced by what Mr Malinda said. Naturally, one thing led to another, and soon the Association was organising a competition based on the seminar. ?So far, we have received 20 submissions, of which 17 are in Sinhala and three in English,?Kulanaka said.?
What interests me here is how the Association has strove to keep the entire project (the culmination of their annual Library Week) as out-there as possible. The quiz competition, on that count, will involve outside parties, all of whom will get a chance to patronise the exhibition. ?It was actually an afterthought of ours. We entered into an agreement with the Royal College General Knowledge Club and invited more than 50 schools,? he said. Underlying all these has been the LRA?s efforts to uplift the habit of reading among their students, efforts which will spill over at Bookland. ??
?We came up with class libraries and organised several reading camps. We got our students to do more than just skim through a book. We asked readers from lower grades to pour out their feelings about them through drawings, while readers from upper grades were asked to write short reviews. It was, I daresay, a success, not least because small children love to draw and children in general love to stand out from the others in what they write.? It has also aided in maintaining discipline; ever since those camps and class libraries began, students have been shouting less in their classrooms. Rajitha interjected here, ?We stand by the principle that if we don?t read, we can?t write, and if we don?t write, there won?t be any readers.? Aptly put. ?
We give our students time to read their books, because it?s not about meeting the authors
These haven?t been their only projects, of course. Nena Pahana, a joint effort by the LRA and Edex, donates books to rural schools annually. Several reading sessions have supplemented it. This gives students the opportunity to meet contemporary writers. ?Last year we featured Dileepa Abeysekara over his translation of Shehan Karunatilaka?s Chinaman. This year we featured Dr Susith Ruwan over his Ravana Meheyuma cycle of novels. We give our students time to read their books, because it?s not about meeting the authors. It?s about asking questions relating to craft, creativity, and even certain flaws which crop up in their work.? A field trip this year to the National Library (?Kiyawanna Purudu Wenna! Pothak?) and several joint projects with the General Knowledge Club have further enriched their activities. Aiding these efforts, moreover, have been the teachers behind the Association. ?We?ve been helped by our teacher in charge, Mrs Yugantha Liyanage, also the Assistant Principal at our school. Our librarians have always been a source of strength for us, particularly their head, Mrs Hemanthi Wijesundera. And in one sense we have to be grateful to our mothers and fathers too.? ? There was much more that I gained from these two boys when I was talking with them, particularly Sanura. I sense a writer?s streak in him, though I will withhold comment. Except, perhaps, for one point; he is quite outspoken about what he is doing and has done, the kind of outspokenness which can win both friends and foes. To this end I asked him as to where he wants to take the Association to, and he replied, ?I want to take them to the Public Library, the British Council Library (if time permits), organise short story competitions and also enter into competitions organised by other institutions. In fact with the 20 or so stories we have collected so far, we can come up with a collection which can be published, even submitted. ?
So what will we see during these two days? The quiz competition, consisting of five rounds of 10 questions each, will be held from 3 to 6 pm on July 31 at Royal College Union Skills Centre. This time will also be used to conduct the awards ceremony for the short story competition (open to any student from any government or international school, and judged by a panel consisting of teachers and ?experts in the field?). The exhibition will continue the following day, from 8 am to 12 pm. What the final outcome will be, we can?t predict. Frankly, I don?t think I am meant to. All I know is that I?ve been looking forward to an event of this nature ever since I left Grade Eight and the best English teacher I got. That explains my enthusiasm, naturally. ?

S. Korea seeks rare talks with North  to ease military tensions
	
?
South Korea on Monday offered to hold rare military talks with the North, aiming to ease tensions after Pyongyang tested its first intercontinental ballistic missile. ??
The offer of talks, the first since South Korea elected dovish President Moon Jae-In, came as the Red Cross in Seoul proposed a separate meeting to discuss reunions of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War. ??
The South?s defence ministry proposed a meeting to be held on Friday at the border truce village of Panmunjom, while the Red Cross offered to hold talks on August 1 at the same venue. If the government meeting goes ahead, it will mark the first official inter-Korea talks since December 2015. Moon?s conservative predecessor, Park Geun-Hye, had refused to engage in substantive dialogue with Pyongyang unless the isolated regime made a tangible commitment to denuclearisation. ??
?We make the proposal for a meeting... aimed at stopping all hostile activities that escalate military tension along the land border,? the defence ministry said in a statement. ?The Red Cross said it hoped for ?a positive response? from its counterpart in the North, hoping to hold family reunions in early October. If realised, they would be the first in two years.

VC refutes Moratuwa Uni responsible for animal slaughter
	
Moratuwa University Vice Chancellor Prof. A.K.W. Jayawardane yesterday denied that Moratuwa University authorities were responsible for the deaths of the dogs and cats and however said there was a fatal accident by its security personnel mistakenly.
While denying animal rights activists? charges, Prof. Jayawardane said the animals were sedated by the University security officers (Rakna Lanka) as it was part of their job not to allow any stray animals into the university facility.
He said the University Medical Centre had records of students who were bitten by these stray dogs therefore concerning the threat to the students and following the complaints received from them, the University authority decided to send the animals away.
However, he said the as a recognized university in the country the Moratuwa University authority did not condone such incidents.
?We maintain a dog free environment within the university premises. It is an unfortunate that the security officers overdosed the animals when they attempted to sedate them. We are also unhappy about the fatal accident, but it is not us who are responsible for their deaths. We would take preventive measures to prevent such recurrence,? Vice Chancellor said.
He further said the method that was used to sedate the animals could not be approved and the university condemned such animal cruelty .
Meanwhile, the State Veterinary Surgeons? Association (SVSA) condemned the incident during a press conference held at Colombo yesterday.
SVSA Secretary Dr. P. L. Kumarawadu said any individual or a group can complaint to the Veterinary Council of such indigenous sedation as it is not possible to carry out such a task without a veterinary surgeon.
He also said the Veterinary Council had enforced the law on several malpractices especially on a case reported in the Habaraduwa area in 2007.
Dr. Kumarawadu said according to the prevailing law it allows the killing of the stray animals using a standard method only under the guidance of a veterinary surgeon however, the law doesn?t allow animal cruelty and therefore charges can be leveled against those responsible.
On Sunday evening, the university students had recovered 10 cats and two dogs on Sunday (16) evening buried in a pit at Homagama opposite a state bank, after being sedated using an anesthetic drug.
Dr. Kumarawadu told the Daily Mirror that this drug was not used to sedate dogs in Sri Lanka as it should be used with caution.
Animal right activists charged that the Rakna Lanka Security Agency which is in charge of the university security had overdosed the animal with Ketamine leading the poor animals to a tragic death. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
