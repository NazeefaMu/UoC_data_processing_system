A division of ideas by Nelun Harasgama and Chaminda Gamage
	
This sharp division of ideas is reflected on the walls  stark monochrome images on one hand with bright primary colours on the other

A combined exhibition of paintings by Nelun Harasgama and Chaminda Gamage at the Barefoot Gallery brings together two very different mindsets.
Harasgama in the introduction to her work emphasises on the quality of suffering: suffering is all around us while Gamage sounds more abstruse: the combination of entirely incompatible entities, sometimes, drives for the success. For easy understanding, we say it is black and white.
This sharp division of ideas is reflected on the walls  stark monochrome images on one hand with bright primary colours on the other.
Both are artists with long track records, their careers going back to the 1980s and 90s. This is bio-data, no more, but it is there for the record. Not all painters improve with time  some do, some dont.

The exhibition will go on till April 16.
Both are artists who like to deal with a central image, or theme, which might puzzle the uninitiated. The two-headed bird Bherunda Pakshiya is one. An explanation is offered in scribbled handwriting in one small image. The handwriting being harder to decipher than the image, one is inevitably drawn into a mysterious realm, into a mythology of forces darker and stronger than oneself.
The colourful side of this artistic combination offers a series of brightly coloured paintings against a recurring central motif  human figures seen from a profile. They are silhouettes, or rather cutouts reminiscent of what Matisse did with coloured paper and a pair of scissors.
The figures, which may be a man and woman (or androgynous figures) suggest sensuality rather than sexuality. Dark, fluid and elastic, they suggest static poses or graceful motion, their dark cutout figures standing out against bright backgrounds whose palette sometimes suggests the tropical sensuality of a Paul Gauguin setting, with overlapping colour layers and pale moons. In the background, one can sometimes discern the plan of a house (another recurring motif) as if the two figures (assuming they represent a couple in this particular painting) and the plan together represents someones hopes for the future, literally speaking.


The stark side of the combination offers a series of oils and acrylics on canvas, much smaller in scale, of solitary human figures in flowing white robes.
Their heads, hands and feet, protruding black or dark brown blobs against a wall of almost overflowing white backgrounds, might be called African and the landscapes suggest deserts. Again, such definitions might be too limiting or not necessary at all. All we can surmise is that the figures are not mythical like the two-headed eagle. Their humanity is all too tangible, and almost overwhelming despite their cropped size and cartoon-like appearance.

A new angle to the tangle
	

The controversial agreement on the Hambantota port deal has run into a serious snag again, they say.

The purohita in charge of the subject who has to sign the agreement on behalf of the government has gone abroad with his sibling in tow.
The purohita had skipped the country at a time he had come under fire from some of his colleagues for his refusal to amend the relevant Act to give legal validity to certain terms in the agreement, they say.
Meanwhile, sources close to the government say that the ports purohitas sudden departure from the country and the acting purohitas public remarks critical of the port deal are an integral part of a plan designed by a section of the government. And the Green party stalwarts who charge that the authorities in the highest echelons had approved the foreign visit purposely point out that this fact has become quite obvious now.

About dogs and others who stray!
	

A certain purohita who took to heart the stray dog menace in the country got his aides to conduct a survey of the stray dog population across the country.

The findings of the survey further convinced this purohita (handling the subject of government at local and provincial level) of the gravity of the problem. So he submitted a proposal to the highest decision making body for rounding up all stray dogs which are not only a public nuisance but are also carriers of the deadly Rabies.
When the proposal came up for discussion at the top table, a purohita from Wayamba, who by the way makes an occasional appearance in the entertainment field as well, laughed and said: Putting on leash or destroying stray dogs is a very good idea. By the way there are political animals too who go astray now and again. We have to put them too on leash! 
All greeted this sally with laughter and the purohita who was the butt of the joke looked momentarily disconcerted and then looked daggers at his tormenter, they say.

A total of 110 Acts had been found to be contradicting with the Right to Information Act when the RTI was implemented, Government Information Department's Director General Ranga Kalansooriya said today.
He said the identified 110 Acts should have to be amended to some extend to be compatible with the RTI Act.
Following the instructions of the Minister Rajitha Senaratne, we conducted an investigation regarding the RTI and we have identified 110 such Acts, he said.
The intention of the people seems to have increased over the RTI Act and they are getting used to use their right, Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka said speaking at the Cabinet briefing.
He said the RTI Act was fully operative from February 3rd enabling people to obtain any information from the Government.
The Minister had formed a special unit to identify and sort out many problems that had cropped up while implementing the RTI, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Awaiting  justice  to be served
	
The students who have studied at SAITM medical School Malabe, pouring their hearts out to Daily Mirror claimed that they are facing an extremely difficult situation with the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) refusing to register them as doctors and as a result of the social stigma created by what they call false stories about the institution. Shane Halpe, who had completed his course and Shakila Dayawansa who is a fourth year students charged that the SLMCs sudden change from a positive stance to a negative was unbelievable. They said SLMC Chairman Prof. Carlo Fonseka was positive about SAITM initially. Following are excerpts of the conversation which Daily Mirror had with the students.

What are the main issues which the SAITM students are facing right now
At the moment we are occupational refugees. This degree is recognized by the government. I am holding an MBBS degree but I dont have the license to practice what I have learnt. The Appeal Court had given a judgment saying SAITM students should be granted the opportunity of getting themselves registered as doctors and to allow them to practice. Although it was judged that way, the Sri Lanka Medical Council still denying SAITM students rights for registration. Internship is also part of the training. That opportunity is also not given to us. The government is clueless. The state doctors, trade union are causing trouble. 
Shakila Dayawansa also expressed the following:-
I joined in 2013. This is an institution which has degree-awarding status. I actually did not have any negative ideas. My issue is somewhat similar to my colleague, Shane. They say the reason they cannot allow students to practice here is the standards. Foreign students who do ACT 16 get the training . They hold classes and they deny us the opportunity. 
Before this institution started there was opposition for this and did you not know about the situation when you got yourself enrolled
When we joined in 2009, there was no public opposition for it. I did London A/Levels and obtained 3 Cs. I was looking for opportunities to do medicine abroad. London A/L students do not get the opportunity in the state medical colleges. There was an agency that sent students to Bangladesh. I was about to go there. Then my parents saw these institutions and asked me whether I would like to consider SAITM, and as the result, I came here. I wanted to join this institution because this was in Sri Lanka and I would be exposed to the local health system and grow up in our culture. I thought I would get a better training. SAITM was in affiliation with a University in Russia. Therefore I thought it was fine. Earlier the plan was to study for four years here and the final year in Russia and come back to do the ACT 16 here. The SLMC suddenly came up with an idea that twin programmes would not be recognized. We were at a difficult situation with the sudden change of affairs. The SLMC advised SAITM to get the University Grants Commission (UGC) recognition and it was taken. 
Are you happy with the training you had received
The lecturers here are qualified. We received good training. We learnt under Russian professors. There were special individualized trainings. Some graduates who train in foreign countries told me that the training they had received was below par. In countries such as Bangladesh, the trainees do not get the opportunity to look at the patients who are in labour. But they are allowed to do the ACT 16 examination. This covers up the gaps in training. Those who are against us are silent about these. 
	 Govt. is clueless; doctors and trade unions are causing trouble
	
	
	 Some foreign-trained graduates say the training they received was below par
	
	
	 We are ready to sit for a common exam along with the medical students of state universities .
	
Shakila:-
Yes, my parents are doctors. The main reason for coming here was that there was a lecturer here who had happened to be my mothers lecturer. So I was happy. Logically there was nothing that could go wrong. My mother says that some of the foreign graduates who formed her batch could not even check the blood pressure. 
Some say that there are students here who have not passed the GCE A/Level examination
I did not recruit the students personally. When it was told that SAITM needs UGC recognition, we were interviewed for the second time. When I came for the first batch, I was only interviewed by the SAITM officials. The UGC accepted our results. Their criteria was 3 Ss and then upgraded to 2 Cs and one S. Therefore there were no students who were failed at the relevant exams. 
If you were asked to sit for a govt exam such as ACT 16, would you agree to it
Yes, if I recall the past, the SLMC came and did an inspection. We asked for exams. They agreed and this could be done after they had passed out and registered. Then what had happened was the panel appointed by the SLMC said they could be registered and gave a list of recommendations. Three days later they changed the report, so we had to go to courts. Anyway, we are ready for any exam, at anytime and anywhere it would be conducted by an independent body. 
Shakila: We are willing to sit for a common exam along with the state medical faculty students.
Did you discuss the issue with the government
We approached the President, explained to him our story and requested him to consider us. He agreed with all what we explained and said that the situation was critical. State medical students and doctors were going against it and they asked us to campaign more vigorously to tell the general public about our side of the story. The negativity was high. Even Prof. Carlo Fonseka assured the students that he would give the recognition. 
Are there students from outside Colombo at SAITM
Yes, there are students from all sections of the society. There are students on scholarships; they are from Galle, Kandy, Ampara and so on. Rs. 550 million worth of scholarships were given, according to the authorities. 
What are the options do you think you have for the future
This is our only option. We have spent our parents money. I dont think we regret coming here. We spent our youth, got through our exams, clinical and our attendance. Everything is taken into consideration. I have no way of going abroad. We are not financially sound. We stay positive because we are unable to do anything. We dont want to take to the streets and cause traffic jams, but we are patiently waiting till justice is meted out. We are frustrated. No possibility to get an alternative job, something that is relevant to medicine. It is a violation of human rights. 
Mostly because of false rumours, we are facing difficulties. We are optimistic that the people would understand our position. We are awaiting justice to be served. 
Shakila also echoed similar sentiments:-
They campaign with the banner saying the students have failed the A/Levels. If they continue to say the standards are low, let them close it or make it as a state-run institution.

## Title: Beware of over-utilising groundwater

Beware of over-utilising groundwater
	
Scarcity of fresh water giving rise to conflict is no longer a theme in sci-fi narratives. Today, for most living in arid parts of the world, it is a daily reality. Nearly one billion people in the developing world do not have access to fresh, clean water. Yet, we in Sri Lanka, an island of abundant resources, take the availability of freshwater for granted. Unbeknown to us with drought threatening livelihoods in the dry zones of the country, unregulated utilisation of groundwater is also threatening the availability of this precious resource. 
What is groundwater
Potable water resources are mainly identified as surface water or groundwater. Unlike surface water bodies such as rivers, lakes and tanks which are usually exposed to harmful human activity, groundwater is less affected as it is the water that is held underground. In other words, groundwater flows through porous media in a paced, slow dispersal and is stored under the topsoil or in pores and crevices found in rock. Because it is hidden beneath and protected from human activity, groundwater is one of the safest and reliable sources of drinking water. 
In Sri Lanka, almost 80% of the rural population depend on groundwater sources for their day-to-day needs which include drinking and sanitation needs. It is also a vital source of water supply to hundreds of farmers and cultivators who depend on groundwater sources in the form of agro-wells scattered across the island. Considering the significance of this gift of nature, it is alarming that little attention has been paid to risks of exhaustion and contamination of groundwater sources. The need to protect these valuable sources of water arose when reports emerged early this year that Coca Cola was eyeing Sri Lanka for a bottling plant after having exhausted groundwater resources in India. 

	80% of the rural population depend on groundwater sources for their day-to-day needs
	
	
	Health implications associated with contaminated sources should be considered seriously
	
	
	Little attention paid to risks of exhaustion and contamination of groundwater sources
	
	
	Over-use threatens water table and surface water bodies
	
	
	Poor management of resources threatening water bodies
	
Use of groundwater
Groundwater resources are widely used for domestic, commercial and industrial purposes, small-scale irrigation and water supply schemes. The Water Resources Board (WRB) states that about 80% of the rural domestic water supply needs are met from groundwater by means of dug and tube wells. Most of the local industries depend heavily on deep wells where groundwater is safe and of good quality. It is manifest that the demand for groundwater supply is increasing, particularly in urban areas in addition to rural water supplies and irrigation of agriculture. As highlighted during the past few months, the rapid expansion of commercial projects is exerting pressure on the available groundwater resources. 
Groundwater is a main water source for irrigation by small farmers, especially during drought periods when tank storage is inadequate. Small farmers, particularly in the areas of North Western and North Central provinces, use large  diameter agro-wells. In coastal sand aquifer areas like the Kalpitiya Peninsula in the Northwest and Nilaveli in the East coast, there has been intensive use of the shallow groundwater for agriculture during the last three decades. 
Over-use and depletion
The U.S. Geological Survey compares the water stored in the ground to money kept in a bank account. If the money is withdrawn at a faster rate than new money is deposited, there will eventually be account-supply problems. Pumping water out of the ground at a faster rate than it is replenished over the long-term causes similar problems. Groundwater pumping, a saviour of dry zone cultivators in Sri Lanka, is the primary cause of groundwater depletion. This in turn can lower the water table where the well is no longer able to reach groundwater. As the water table lowers, pumps must reach farther in the ground, consuming more power and thereby invoking more costs. Little known is the fact that surface water will not exist without groundwater. Depletion of groundwater tables threatens the water supply to surface water resources such as rivers and lakes. Ultimately, over pumping also threatens to collapse layers of soil causing what is known as land subsidence. 
Threats of contamination
According to the Head of the Bio-systems Engineering Department, Wayamba University Dr. D.S.P. Kuruppuarachchi, some aquifers in Sri Lanka are already contaminated with poisonous chemicals in intensely cultivated areas. An aquifer is an underground layer of permeable rock, sediment or soil that yields water. The pore spaces in aquifers are filled with water and are interconnected, so that water flows through them. This means that sandstone, unconsolidated gravel and porous limestone make the best aquifers. 
Nitrate is a common Nitrogenous compound found in the natural processes of the Nitrogen cycle. In Sri Lanka, researchers have uncovered that concentrations of the compound have greatly increased, particularly in groundwater; the key reason of contamination being the application of Nitrogen-rich fertilizers in agricultural processes. 
Studies in coastal sand aquifers revealed that the build-up of Nitrate was quite dramatic and estimated at 12 mg-N l-1per annum, which is certainly unacceptable both in terms of water quality deterioration and waste of valuable crop nutrients, Dr. Kuruppuarachchi cites in his research. 
As groundwater is the main or probably the only source of potable water in aquifers where intensive agriculture is practised, health implications associated with high intake of Nitrate should be considered seriously and appropriate management plans should be implemented in order to enhance the sustainable and efficient use of the groundwater resource, he warns. 
As Dr. Kuruppuarachchi notes, agriculture in many developing countries including Sri Lanka is increasingly dependent on chemicals, mainly due to cost and yield concerns in organic cultivating. As the land available for crop production and water for irrigation is meanwhile becoming increasingly limited, increased food production to meet the demands must use intensive agriculture methods. 
According to Dr. Kuruppuarachchi, in many areas, intensive crop production occurs on soils directly overlying shallow aquifers used for potable water supply as well as irrigation. The threat to groundwater quality and the risk to potable supplies are growing, mainly due to the intensification of irrigated agriculture and accompanying increase of the use of fertilizers and pesticides. 
Unregulated agro-wells
Even without a drought threatening the island, the supply of water has constantly been a problem for the intermediate and dry zones of Sri Lanka. Research suggests that 90% of these zones are on hard-rock aquifers, where agro-wells have been installed in place of hard-rock aquifers. However, the lack of guidance and a general unawareness have resulted in a spring of unauthorised agro-wells. 
At present, a farmer can (at free will) exploit his private land and use a resource of water that is in fact a resource belonging to all. When reviewing the use of groundwater sources, it is apparent that development of agro-wells has taken place in a rather haphazard and chaotic manner sans the expertise of the relevant authorities. So far, government authorities have only been able to offer technical services and offer financial aid for the installation of agro-wells. 
When questioned of this flaw in resource management, Water Resources Board (WRB) Chairman A.C.M. Zulficar said prompt measures were underway to address the issue. 
A special Gazette was issued in March to help address the unregulated digging of agro-wells. So far, the water management system in Sri Lanka has been governed by an act of 1954, where no improvements had been made to address the shortcomings. However, the new Gazette addresses three main issues in groundwater, namely water contamination, over extraction and misuse of natural springs, Zulficar explained. 
When questioned as to why such action was delayed, the WRB Chairman responded saying no authority had taken interest in the matter all these years. 
I was appointed Chairman during the latter part of 2015 and began to implement these procedures. We are now formulating a programme to raise awareness on the proper use of groundwater resources. For this purpose, we are building a network including the Divisional Secretariats, District Secretariats and our zonal officers. This joint programme will be launched in the coming weeks to educate the public on the proper use and management of groundwater resources, he said. 
New regulations
According to the Gazette issued on March 15 under the Water Resources Board Act No. 29 of 1964, any individual, government or private institute seeking to utilise natural water springs or groundwater for any purpose or project, should obtain written permission from the WRB and it should be carried out under its supervision. 
The construction of agro-wells with diameters more than four metres, dug and tube wells for commercial purposes utilising natural springs, and those engaged in the construction of tube and dug wells must be registered with the WRB prior to drilling. The safe yield of the well should be assessed under the supervision of the WRB. 
A flow metre should be fixed by the industry owner to monitor the amount of water pumped from the well daily and the data on daily pumped water capacities should be maintained. 
Data in respect to all tube wells constructed by the above registered parties must be submitted to the WRB every three months. 
If any individual or organisation is engaged in water bottling industry, beverage industry and uses water from springs or groundwater for their manufacturing purposes, a water sample should be analysed once in every six months from a chemical laboratory. 
A perimeter protection report should be taken from the WRB of those who extract groundwater amounting to more than 30,000 litres per month for commercial agriculture or industry. The WRB states that it will use these records to maintain their database and employ the information in groundwater management and planning in future. The Daily Mirror s attempts to contact officials of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board to query their strategies in accordance with the new regulations to tackle the management issues of groundwater resources resulted in failure.

Dos and Donts of Bathing
	


Staying clean is vital for healthy living. People wash and have showers to clean sweat, dirt and accumulated oils, beauty products and other waste gathered on the skin. We asked Ayurvedic doctor D.D.A Hettiarachchi what forms of Ayurveda had to say about bathing 
The best period to bathe is between 10 and 10.30 in the morning, if possible with moderately hot water. Early morning showers are usually colder and shrink the skin, disturbing its cleaning process. Therefore, they are suitable only for washing the exterior of ones skin. During daytime, skin pores open up and discharge the waste collected and bathing will clean the body in and out. The body exudes heat through the head and the only way to cool down is by bathing. 
Bathing in the sea is recommended at around 11 a.m as the immunity system is strongest at that time. Bathing five days a week is sufficient and one bath is enough for a day. Washing ones body two or three times a day is necessary to stay clean. During pregnancy, women should avoid bathing on Tuesdays and Fridays; according to Indian Ayruvedic opinion. 
Are soaps harmful
Soaps can harm healthy skin through daily use. Soaps dry out the skin unnecessarily by washing out essential oils that are naturally found in skin. Natural fat layers are vital to protect the skin from external germs. Healthy oils in the skin attract germs, acting like glue. Overusing soaps can give easy access to germs as soap destroys the protective layer made of oil. Using harsh chemicals (shampoos) for the head also dries out the natural oils in the scalp.
Sometimes people cannot tell psoriasis and dandruff apart. People in the past used organic materials such as Sandalwood and Kokumagara for cleaning purposes. Rubbing these materials against a stone and producing a fine powder was the method and the powder was applied all over the skin; the natural substances in the powdery mixture stayed on the skins surface, hydrating the skin and controlling sweat.
Advice to patients
People prone to phlegm and suffering from wheeze are advised to use warm water for bathing and washing. Warm water benefits them rather than cold water.
Not at all at night
Theres nothing wrong in having an occasional and unmissable shower at night. But its not advisable for kids and the elderly due to the cold atmosphere at night. After bathing at night using warm water, dry yourself as soon as possible and get dressed to retain the heat inside. Warm water opens up pores; thus germs can easily enter. Therefore covering the body and going to bed is the best option. Nearly 95% of elderly people over 65 years have weakened hearts, and using cold water to wash at night can disturb their internal blood circulation.
Bathing in warm water is good for people with skin disorders and they should apply ointment to the affected areas to prevent the entry of germs.

A suspected chemical attack killed at least 58 civilians including several children in rebel-held northwestern Syria on Tuesday, a monitor said, with the opposition accusing the government and demanding a UN investigation. 
The attack in the town of Khan Sheikhun left dozens suffering respiratory problems and symptoms including vomiting, fainting and foaming at the mouth, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. A hospital in the town where doctors were treating victims of the attack was also bombarded, an AFP correspondent said. 
The entrance of the building was hit, bringing down rubble on top of medics who had earlier been seen dousing a steady stream of arrivals to wash away chemical residue. 
The violence came as the European Union and UN hosted a conference in Brussels on Syrias future, with confusion over Washingtons position on the issue of Syrian President Bashar al-Assads future.

Govt. denies salary increase to Ministers and MPs
	
The government today denied any move to increase the salaries of ministers and MPs in the guise of increasing salaries of Supreme Court and Appeal Court judges.
Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe and State Minister of Highways Dilan Perera informed the House last evening.
Mr. Rajapaka said the salaries of judges are increased under Section 108(1) of the Constitution whereas salaries of MPs have to be increased under Section 68(1) of the Constitution.
However, MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara said it is natural for anyone to suspect that salaries of MPs would be increased when salaries of judges are increased as both are considered equal when it comes to remuneration. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

He bearded the lion in his den
	

The high-powered committee piloting the countrys economy met the other day for deliberations on some pressing issues.

Among those present at this meeting were Second in Command in yahapalanaya, purohitas in charge of subjects directly related to the finances and trade and several consultants considered economic wiz-kids.
While on the subject of taxes being levied on exporters, most participants requested the holder of the public purse to re-consider a certain harsh decision taken by him. Although one or two participants backed the stand taken up by the public purse holder, the others insisted that the issue be resolved in favour of the countrys exporter-community.
Heated arguments ensued when the public-purse-holding-purohita stuck to his guns unmoved by the reasons adduced by the participants. However, the purohita appeared unnerved when the top consultant Paski lashed out at him for his obstinate refusal to listen to others.
Following the meeting, two prominent political authorities who attended the event, warmly congratulated Consultant Paski for taking the bull by the horns, they say.

How can I take measures to help my balance
	

QI am 75-years-old and experiencing a few of the symptoms mentioned in the article published in Health Capsule on signs of Parkinsons disease. My sense of balance and my ability to turn and go backwards are the immediate problems. So far, I have no trembling factors. I use a walking stick at times to overcome balancing problems. As I am a diabetic, I need to follow Ayurveda medicine to avoid damage to my kidneys. Please advise me on how I can take preventive measures and other procedures that maybe required. - Jith Wijeyesekera
A. Judging by the problems you have indicated, it does not sound as if you have symptoms of Parkinsons disease. Parkinsons disease is a fairly common brain disorder among senior citizens. It is primarily identified with the onset of a few significant symptoms. Parkinsons disease (PD) causes shaking and stiffness and affects the balance and coordination of a person. 
On average, those with Parkinsons are diagnosed around age 60, although the risk increases with age. According to the National Institutes of Health, this is because its easy to confuse early symptoms of the disease with things that happen normally during the aging process. This means that some may suffer simply from difficulties of old age and not necessarily PD. 
Given your advanced age and your diabetic condition, my judgement is that you are not suffering from PD. Long term treatments for Diabetes can have side-effects which usually include the problems you have mentioned. However it is advisable that you also seek the advice of your doctor if problems persist. 
Out of the problems we face during our advanced years, many illnesses, disabilities and risks associated with chronic disease are avoidable through known prevention measures. These include leading a healthy lifestyle, early detection of diseases, injury prevention, and self-managing certain conditions such as pain and difficulty upon a doctors advice. 
The balance in a normal persons body is dependent on many factors, including multiple systems of the body. These however could change according to some external factors as well, in your case; I suspect this to be the treatment of Diabetes. The body has three primary sensory systems that work together to create postural stability. With normal brain function, the vestibular system of the inner ear coordinates with the visual system and proprioceptors that sense the position and movement of your body in space. These three systems work together while we perform simple tasks, such as standing and walking. 
When self-managing your condition, you must take caution in your movements. When you wake up in the morning, do not attempt to walk a long distance as soon as you get out of bed. You must first stretch your limbs while seated in bed and straighten up. Only after a few minutes following some mild stretches, should you attempt to keep your feet on the floor and walk. Brief bouts of dizziness may be provoked in some people by changing the orientation of the head to gravity. Seek the advice of your doctor for the best type of exercises for you as your body. Conditions may respond to different forms of exercise, while your capabilities must also be taken into consideration. It must be noted that this is however a common side-effect of Diabetes medication. 
You must also avoid bending over for prolonged periods of time as this could also affect your stability. Stressing your neck while raising your head upwards for a long period should also be avoided. You must always maintain a comfortable posture that does not strain your neck when carrying yourself. 
With proper diagnosis, many of the causes that result in imbalance, dizziness or falls can be treated with lifestyle changes. You can also make lifestyle choices that have been shown to improve balance and facilitate good health as we age. But first, it is important to have adequate nutrition which includes a balanced diet of fruits, vegetables, protein and low-sugar foods. 
Regular exercise and staying active also can reduce the risk of you suffering stability and imbalance problems. A progressive exercise programme with a moderate to high level of balance exercises and cardiovascular conditioning performed according to your physicians advice can be an effective way to manage your difficulties. 
It is advisable to continue the use of your walking stick as this may give you more stability and increase your confidence. This will also prevent you from suffering a fall and suffering fractures to your bones which are in a vulnerable stage given your age.

## Title: Hyperactivity and ADHD
## Section: Medicine

Hyperactivity and ADHD
	

A child who can never stay in one place, is always on the go, is messy and doesnt complete a task, is hot-tempered, impulsive and always leaves things behind at school. These are some ways parents describe this particular group of children and adolescents who may have Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder or ADHD. However, in the recent past, ADHD has become a much hackneyed and sometimes misunderstood term. Using ADHD as a label for children with difficult behaviour arising from multiple reasons is unhelpful.

The name itself is misleading because in more ways than one, these children have difficulties regulating their attention rather than being attention deficit. Thus, their attention tends to drift easily. It is difficult to refocus and they may have difficulties concentrating on multiple things at once.
However, inattention and hyperactivity are very relative terms, dependent on the environment and the demands placed on an individual. Thus, differentiating ADHD from other factors affecting attention is a complicated task, requiring expertise and experience. 
While ADHD is a problem, all issues having to do with attention are not ADHD. Even in the case of ADHD, these problems can be related to the environment. They arise when there is a mismatch between the attention capacity and the demand of the task at hand. In this day and age, with the high need to excel in academics placed on children, the demand placed on their attention capacity is also high.
The 3 main symptom clusters in ADHD are related to attention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. Other representations of this disorder include a child who is unable to plan his activities, a severe dislike for tasks that require attention (like academic work!), frequently losing or misplacing items at school, not responding to his name because he is so engrossed in an activity, being unable to engage in play in a calm manner and jumping into and interrupting conversations between others. While being impulsive may not be unusual for children, some children with ADHD are impulsive to the level that it is dangerous. In some children, this may lead to recurrent accidents. However, these are only indicators and have to be seen in context. The symptoms should also be persistent and several of these issues need to be present together. 
While the boy who is always on the go and is impossible to contain is easily identified by parents, a girl who is silent and apparently calm but struggles to regulate her attention is less easily understood. Both children may have ADHD and may benefit from assessment. It has been shown that girls with this condition have issues with attention rather than hyperactivity. For parents who have concerns, it might be valuable to discuss these with their childrens teachers, as they will be able to give a different perspective to the issue as they are in a position to observe them in a structured environment (the classroom). 
Some children with ADHD also have issues in higher order functions, or what are called executive functions. However, not all children with this condition have these deficits. These functions include working memory, planning and impulse and emotional regulation.Thus, remembering a list of things to do and planning it out might actually be more difficult for these children rather them being lazy. 

Causes for ADHD 
While ADHD is currently considered a neurodevelopmental disorder, it can be understood as a delay in the development of attention and self-regulation. The largest imaging study of its kind was conducted recently, indicating that several parts of the brain showed subtle differences in children with ADHD. 
Heritability or the component thought to be due to genetics is high in ADHD. However, this does not mean that because the father or a sibling has ADHD, other siblings should have it too. The association is more complex. It is also thought that the symptoms of ADHD are on a spectrum, thus some may have more difficulties than others. Furthermore, environmental factors in the early development of the brain too are believed to affect ADHD. A low birth weight and smoking during pregnancy are among the better described and studied factors associated with this condition. 

Treatment 
Treatment would depend on the individual needs and circumstances of each child. As it is important not to label conditions that can be explained otherwise as ADHD, a broad understanding of the circumstances and factors affecting the child is important. A first step would be a thorough assessment to exclude other medical, psychiatric, family and environmental issues. For example, learning difficulties and family issues can both be present in an inattentive child. 
Treatment is usually a combination of medication, behavioural modifications, modified teaching and environmental modifications. It is also important to regularly reassess children with ADHD as their circumstances and attention capacities may have changed, requiring changes to be made to the treatment plan. Some symptoms of ADHD, especially hyperactivity and impulsivity, also improve as children reach adulthood.  As children with ADHD are known to have many other issues that go together with the disorder like anxiety, learning difficulties and disobedience, these issues may also need to be addressed. If they are not addressed, it may lead to secondary problems like refusing to go to school. 
However, ADHD is not a disorder that you should be afraid of. With proper understanding and management, children with this condition can grow up to become successful adults.

On the advice and instructions of Mahanayake Theras of the Malwatta and Asgiri Chapters, Lekakadhikari Theras, Ven Dr. Medagama Sri Dhammananda Thera (Asgiri) and Ven Dr. Pahamune Sri Sumangala Thera (acting Lekakadhikari Thera of the Malwatu Chapter) had presented a letter containing 21 points, in which the two chapters request for response.
This document was presented to the President at his official residence in Kandy during a visit made by him today. The President thereafter met both the Lekakadhikaris and the Monks of the senior Sangha Saba.
Don't open road in front of Maligawa
Is Sri Lanka a narcotics hub
Monitor NGO activities
Introduce solution to N/E issue

The document covered the subject of official vesting of all buildings within the precincts of the Dalada Maligawa, with the Dalada Maligawa, refraining from opening the road in front of the Maligawa, and construction of a broad tunnel up to Louis Peiris Mawatha and Rajapihilla with the aim of easing the traffic congestion in the Kandy town, the concern about Sri Lanka being used as head quarters for drugs, undertake the widening of the Katugastota, Asgiriya, and Getambe road.
The monitoring of activities of NGOs, making people aware if bringing in a new Constitution or making amendments to the present one, ensuring the Wildlife conservation areas, creating awareness on the reconciliation council, its aims and the proposed activities, and in introducing a political solution to the North East issue by further securing the powers of the President and arriving at a solution with powers centered at the central government were highlighted in the 21-point letter presented to the President.
"The Upcountry Village Rehabilitation Commission should be restored and steps should be taken to uplift the Sinhala people living in the land locked villages in between prominently Muslim and Tamil villages. The public representatives in these electorates are virtually Tamils or Muslims who purposely neglect the prominently Sinhala villages. This compels them to sell their traditional land to the Muslims and leave the area. It is necessary to create awareness in this regard, the letter also highlighted. (J. A. L. Jayasinghe)

## Title: Pros and cons of protein supplements

Pros and cons of protein supplements
	

Keeping fit has become a challenge with todays busy lifestyles. But for those who take extra care with their health, maintaining a healthy fitness regimen has become a habit. Protein supplements are an essential component of fitness schedules but to what extent these supplements should be consumed has remained a question. Speaking to Health Capsule, Tiron Wickramasinghe Certified Fitness Instructor from International Sports Science Association USA, who has over fifteen years of experience in the industry, elaborated on the intake of protein supplements, in what instances they should be used and how to use them wisely. 

Q In what instances are protein supplements recommended
High-quality protein or protein powder is convenient for making an on-the-go protein shake when you are out and about. The powder itself needs no refrigeration and you can easily mix it with juice or water at the gym or on the road to help maintain your daily protein intake. Depending on the source of the protein powder, it can offer specific fitness benefits. For instance, whey-based protein powders contain high levels of branched-chain amino acids. These amino acids, combined with an exercise programme, can help build muscle, prevent muscle breakdown and assist in post-exercise recovery.
Protein powders containing casein supply your body with slow-digesting forms of protein which ensures your cells receive a steady supply of this nutrient.


Q What are some of the key ingredients included in them
Whey is one of the key ingredients in supplements. Whey is in fact a protein that makes up approximately 20 percent of the total protein content in cows milk. It is also a by-product of cheese manufacturing and has many commercial uses. Whey protein is the name given to globular proteins that are isolated from whey and are usually a combination of alpha-lactalbumin, beta-lactoglobulin and serum albumin. It may contain glycomacropeptides as well. Whey protein contains a rich amino acid profile. It is easily digestible and this facilitates easy absorption of protein and is useful for building muscle mass. It enhances the flow of nutrients to help rebuild and repair muscle tissue. 

Q What is the recommended amount that should be consumed and how frequently should it be done 
Step on a scale and be honest with yourself about your workout regimen. Highly trained athletes thrive on 0.77 gram of daily protein per pound of body weight. Thats 139 grams for a 180-pound man. In fact, men who work out for five or more days a week, for an hour or longer need 0.55 grams per pound. Men who work out 3 to 5 days a week for 45 minutes to an hour also need 0.45 grams per pound. So a 180-pound guy who works out regularly needs about 80 grams of protein a day. 
On the other hand, if youre trying to lose weight, protein is still crucial. The fewer calories you consume, the more calories should come from proteins. You need to boost your protein intake to between 0.45 and 0.68 gram per pound to preserve calorie-burning muscle mass.


Q If consumed in excess what are the side-effects 
Excess dietary protein can lead to elevated blood sugar, weight gain, kidney stress, leaching of bone minerals and stimulating cancer cells. Restricting your protein to plant-only sources may create a sulphur deficiency and potentially accelerate age-related functional decline. 

Q Should they be used only during training or working out
The most important time is right after a workout. Your muscles are like a sponge and need instant nutrition for muscle recovery and growth. The other instances include right before bed; this means that youre about to sleep for six to eight hours. Thats a long time without protein. Can you imagine going throug your day (while awake) not eating 6 to 8 hours 
It is also recommended to take proteins as soon as you wake up. Here again, you have just gone six to eight hours without proper nutrition and your body needs protein quickly. 
Another instance where you need to have proteins is half an hour before a workout. This sets up the anabolic window before your workout and provides your muscles with adequate nutrition so that the effects of weight training (weight training breaks down muscle-called catabolic) are not as severe.


Q As a fitness instructor, can you give a message to the youth on how they should use supplements wisely
If your lifestyle and sports require more protein, then protein supplements become important. The workout window also makes protein consumption from supplement sources important. It all depends on the person and if you can get your protein from food then more power to you. However, from my experience, I have found that most people do not get enough protein in their diet and therefore can benefit from a protein supplement. 
Always consult your coach as they can help you with your protein consumption, amount and timing.

Sri Lanka has lost Rs. 1,953 million within just two and a half months from January 15 to March 31, this year due to the controversial deal struck with Swiss Singapore Overseas Enterprises Pvt. Ltd to provide coal to Norochcholai Power Plant, Anti Corruption Front (ACF) yesterday said.
Advisor of the ACF, Keerthi Tennakoon said Sri Lanka has to pay the company US$ 13.75 more for a metric tonne of coal compared to other companies that provide coal under the spot tender method to Sri Lanka.
He said the Ministry has today stopped purchasing coal through the open market and that under the instructions of Ministry Secretary Suren Batagoda, the Lanka Coal Company has purchased coal for a price of US$ 91.75 per metric tonne through the controversial tender.
The price of a metric tonne purchased under the spot tender method was US$ 77.98. Had the government purchased coal under spot tender method, it would have only spent US$ 171,639,126. Therefore, we have incurred a loss of US$ 12,766,337 (Rs 1,953,249,561) from this deal, he said.
Mr. Tennakoon said we can only imagine the loss Sri Lanka will incur as the tender progresses and unfortunately the tax payer will have to dig deeper into their pockets to safeguard the country from this corrupt deal as well.
He said the loss incurred by this deal was only second to the Central Bank Bond Sale scam.
Meanwhile, responding to State Minister of Power Ajith P Pereras statement that those who criticize the deal are traitors, Mr. Tennakoon said the Rajapaksa Administration also labelled Board of Investment (BOI) Chairman Upul Jayasuriya and himself as 'traitors' when they exposed massive government corruption.

SAITM : Choice is between  free education and freedom of education
	
On the face of things, SAITM appears to be the main issue in the country today. In reality, however, there are much more crucial issues than SAITM that are brewing demanding national attention. Yet, the university students and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), with the weight of the GMOA behind them, have managed to catapult this issue to the forefront and media has followed by blowing it out of proportion. When the university students take up an issue, their version of social justice tends to colour their overall judgement altogether. The JVP has garnished the situation making it an issue between the rich and influential and deserving poor. In the leftist cocoon-thinking, the poor are always virtuous and the rich invariably cruel. Thus an educational issue has been very craftily converted into a one of social injustices. 
The public perception of this issue is utterly prejudiced and warped. The notion of one should not be allowed to become a doctor through money gathers currency when it is sold by the propaganda geniuses of the JVP and its comrades-in-arms. The Upadi Kade (Degree Shops) - rhetoric of the JVP is effective. It is not a case of some moneyed students trying to buy their way into the medical profession. On the contrary, all the budding doctors - whether SAITM or otherwise - sit for a common exam, and then face the SLMC qualifying standards. Thus, it is a case of common criteria that all the hopefuls are being put through to ascertain their academic prowess, irrespective of their wealth. The only difference is that, one lot has paid for their education with their own money whereas the other lot has earned a place in a university paid by public funds. The SAITM candidates, like Shylock, the Merchant of Venice, have been more sinned against than sinning. 


It is also wildly rumoured that Ministers Rajitha Senaratne and Lakshman Kiriella are having more than cordial relationships with the SAITM students. If so, it should be highly commended. The writer is no fan of either of these Ministers and in fact, considers that both are not handling this issue competently. Yet, in a situation where the country and the public are facing an important policy matter, personal antipathy and politics should not be a relevant factor. The issue at hand is whether Sri Lanka should have private medical education or not, and if the nation is in favour of private education, there is nothing to bar Rajithas nephew and Kiriellas niece from becoming medical doctors as long as they have the will and meet the set criteria. In todays civilised world everybody should have the right for education of their choosing. 
Then, the issue of non-availability of facilities for conduct of practical lessons and maintenance of the required standards in SAITM: The first problem could be solved with the patronage of the Health Ministry. Why cant the Ministry allow SAITM graduates to attend government hospitals to do their internship since the institution is approved by the University Grants Commission (UGC) What is the warped logic of the GMOAs opposition to this, when one of their grievances against SAITM graduates happens to be their lack of practical application Further, on other specifications cited, what prevents the SAITM management from responding to the SLMA demands, since it has expressed its preparedness to bend over backwards to obtain full recognition for its students. The SLMC is a legitimate stakeholder in this issue but this can well be solved if the Government and SLMC cooperate in a constructive frame of mind. Do we have the will and the need to resolve this issue But the hard truth is something else: the political environment is too toxic and poisonous for any rational resolution of the issue. 

	Minimum requirement for students to enter Medical College is three simple passes at GCE A Level
	
	
	State Universities cannot physically accommodate those who are qualified to do medicine
	
	
	Free-educated university students always showed self-destructive tendencies
	
Then of course, you have the University students staging protest marches threatening to make SAITM a matter of life and death for them. Who are these students and are they the think-tanks that decide on the countrys educational policy Just because they have been fortunate enough to get selected to the universities funded by the public, what right do they have to deny the right of education to the less fortunate students who are prepared to pay for their education Are we prepared to sacrifice the Freedom of Education of the general public of this country at the altar of Free Education funded by the general public 
The minimum requirement of a student to enter the Medical College is three simple passes at the G.C.E. A/Level examination. However, all those who obtain such standards are not accommodated in the Universities, since the they have entry limits, and hence, the entrants are selected on the basis of the facilities of different districts and on the marks they obtained at the A/Level examinations. In the context of the current competitive environment, each year, hundreds of students, who could otherwise attend the medical college, are shut out purely because the public-funded Universities cannot physically accommodate them. Against such a backdrop, what moral right do these students who get selected to these State Universities have to deprive those who are ready to pay for their education of that fundamental right C.W.W. Kannangara, the father of free education would be turning in his grave to see the beneficiaries of his free education abusing that very free education to deprive another lot in the country of freedom of education. 


The student population is one of the most volatile and aggressive segments in any country. Their numerous demands, their education and their natural anti-social outlook are handy tools in the hands of greedy and crafty politicians. Their revolutionary burst in 1971 in the guise of a JVP-led insurrection, although brutally suppressed and decimated by Sirimavo Bandaranaikes government, found another expression in 1987-89 period in the faade of a second revolution. Ever since that outburst, these free-educated University students always showed a self-destructive tendency to block public roads and conduct their protests all the while. These free educated University students in Sri Lanka will not rest. The difference between free education and freedom of education has eluded these so-called educated minds. 
In this country, the University lectures are 100 % free, and as we know when something is given free, the recipient invariably fails to appreciate that, however, valuable that may be. On top of that, not having to work for education gives a lot of time for these students to dabble in politics, and when such political issues are cloaked in a garb of social justice, such opposition or dabbling assumes unwavering justification. Further, being at an age of exuberance and promise of youth, these students assume that the whole world is their playground. In such a dynamic context, the current unrest of the Sri Lankan University students, having not yet climaxed to an explosive end, looks a misguided journey of a drunkard. Having availed themselves of free education, they are opposing a policy that ensures their brethren the same at a cost. They must remember that a majority of students who are seeking admission and completion of their medical degree in private universities are not millionaires children. Most of them may have had their parents land, jewellery and other properties pawned and mortgaged to a bank or the village lender. That story never ends in Sri Lanka and our student population is part and parcel of this sad saga. 


However, this discussion is not complete without a word about the JVP. The State-run Universities are the breeding ground for the JVP activists. So, protection of the status quo of these universities is of prime importance to them. When it comes to Universities, issues such as private tuition at the A/L stage, International schools, graduating in foreign Universities etc. are not valid to the JVP. For the free-educated University students and their political mentors, the JVP, the issue of SAITM is not one of education or medical standards, but an issue of political survival. 
There is yet another contentious position with regard to this whole anti-SAITM issue. The SLMC has accepted the medical degree offered by 77 international Universities as the basic entry requirement to sit for the SLMC examination, which includes 23 universities in Malaysia. Therefore, if Dr. Neville Fernando started his SAITM in the neighbouring Malaysia, and if this same batch of Sri Lankan students were enrolled there, the SLMC may not have had any qualms about allowing them to sit for the SLMC entry examination. Thus, the SAITM issue finally gets reduced to an issue of location rather than an issue of standards. It is indeed an irony that we are spending billions of foreign exchange to send our children to foreign universities while countries like Malaysia are earning billions of foreign exchange having allowed private Universities to flourish in their country during the past 20 years. 
In short, SAITM is not an issue of any meaningful social injustice. It is a dangerous symptom of a malignant social disease of hatred, jealousy and class-enmity.

SAITM should be nationalized - GMOA Secretary Dr. Navin de Zoysa
	
Ahead of a planned strike by doctors countrywide, the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) vowed that it would not relent until the SAITM issue was addressed. In an interview with Daily Mirror, GMOA Secretary Dr. Navin de Zoysa said that ample time was given to the government, but nothing was done.

You are planning on trade union action on Friday over the SAITM issue How justifiable is it to inconvenience patients
We had given enough time to sort out the issue starting from 2010. Then, we wrote a report about the Malabe Private Medical College. Today, they have not taken legal action against what is stated in that report. If there is any false complaint made by us in this report questioning the standard of the medical college, they can institute legal action. We called it a fraudulent institute. At that point, we called it an economic fraud. Today, there is even an academic fraud. Only students have gone to court seeking registration by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC). It amounts to the students taking on the institution in a way. The Health Minister and the Minister of Higher Education are with them. Only the SLMC is with the defence in the case.


"Universities Act says the relevant professional bodies have to be consulted. Then, you have to take a compliance certificate. Then only, it can be given. Neither Mr. Kiriella nor his predecessor Mr. Dissanayake got this certification in respect of SAITM"

The gazette notification, issued in connection with SAITM, is not legal. It was issued by Minister S.B. Dissanayake at that time. It is not a gazette recognizing the degree awarding status. A separate gazette is needed for it. Yet, the gazette notice issued is conditional. We pointed it out. Then, a committee was appointed. That affirmed our position in the report. Then, the Health Ministry Secretary, at the time, asked the SAITM authorities not to recruit any more students.
That is the understanding of the Ministry Secretary at that time. I do not know whether Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has a different stand. Recently, all the Deans of the State Medical Faculties submitted a report. They also affirmed the position that no degree awarding
status had been given to SAITM. The SLMC, the governing body of medical education, also says SAITM is not up to standard. No compliance of certificate given for awarding medical degrees. So, all the parties- the Ministry of Health under the then authorities, the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA), the SLMC and the Medical Faculty Deans subscribe to the same stand that SAITM cannot award degrees. However, the present Health Minister, and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella have a stand otherwise. 
Minister Kiriella asserts that there is a court ruling in favour of SAITM, and it cannot be altered whimsically. What is your stance
Then, we have to look at the legal aspect. First, we should know that we live in Sri Lanka, not in Europe or anywhere else. So, the Chief Justice was removed in the way the government wanted. Now, they talk about how the law and order should be observed. Anyway, we have to think whether the relevant authorities serve justice to people. At the meeting with us, President Maithripala Sirisena said he should go by the decision of the committee appointed by him to look into it. The President has a better understanding. There are two legal procedures. Mr. Kiriella and Dr. Senaratne always refer to the ruling by the Court of Appeal. There are 42 pages in this. In 41 pages, the court elaborates on the areas with discrepancies in this regard. There are two cases here. The Higher Education Minister has the authority to grant the degree awarding status. The SLMC has the authority to decide on quality and service of medical profession and education. When it comes to SAITM, the SLMC can deal in regard to medical education. If minimum standards are set out, that has to be announced in a gazette notification. In 2009, Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva tried to do it. In 2011 and 2012, President Sirisena, as the Health Minister, tried to do it. He, in fact, gazetted it. But, Parliament rejected it. 
When granting degree awarding status, the Universities Act says the relevant professional bodies have to be consulted. Then, you have to take a compliance certificate. Then only, it can be given. Neither Mr. Kiriella nor his predecessor Mr. Dissanayake got this certification in respect of SAITM. So, SAITM is set up on an illegal format. It has to be revoked. That is the main demand of ours. They have manipulated the legal system to their advantage. SAITM has no degree awarding status granted through the
lawful channel. 
What does GMOA suggest to do in respect of SAITM- to standardize it or to nationalize it
The pro- SAITM politicians and people speak in favour of private medical education. That is their logic. It may be. The GMOA has not taken a decision either for or against private medical education. We have taken a different stand. If the government is going to have a policy decision, that is it. We cannot comprise the quality of private medical education, though. That is our stand. SAITM started in 2009. First, it was started as something related to media. It moved to management next and then to medicine. It took the approval of the Board of Investment which clearly said the Ministry of Health should give approval for health related degrees to be offered. There is no such approval. If the law prevails, the SAITM authorities should be punished. Even former President Mahinda Rajapaksa does not want to initiate legal action against them.


"The GMOA does not believe that SAITM has degree awarding status. Without having degrees, how can they ask for a qualifying examination to become doctors As for foreign graduates, they are degree holders sitting that examination"

This regime fears legal action against SAITM Chairman Dr. Neville Fernando. There is this stage managed incident of SAITM CEO Sameera Senaratne being shot. No one was arrested in connection with it though the police found out what happened actually. The Prime Minister said he would give a report to Parliament regarding it. Nothing happened. This institution is safeguarded by politicians. Our demand is that SAITM should be abolished or nationalized. It is committing economic and academic frauds. SAITM should not exist. 
Most people cry foul about the fate of current students there. In the financial scandal committed by Sakvithi, the Central Bank found it. The police arrested Sakvithi. If the students have the minimum qualifications, they can become doctors within a certain time period following the proper way. Before that, recruitments to SAITM should be stopped. Then legal action should be instituted against corrupt people. Then, SAITM should be nationalized. We can think of the students afterwards. The students have nothing to worry if they have basic qualifications. Merely because of the plight of these students, we cannot allow the government to legalize this institution. 
Now, these students have invested so much money and a lot of time. What is the solution you offer them
The right to education is one thing. But, the right to life and to have better healthcare is another. If we compare and contrast these two aspects, greater importance should be attached to the right to live. We cannot compromise the right to live over the right to education. The students are now embroiled in a crisis. There should be a way out. The government can take over this institution like in the Colombo North Medical Faculty case. The students with enough qualifications can become doctors one day. We do not want to victimize them. 
The SAITM authorities say their students are taught by a fine set of medical teachers formerly attached to the state medical faculties. How do you respond
The number of medical teachers will not suffice to ensure the quality of medical education here. The SLMC is having guidelines. They have not been gazetted by the Minister. That is the criterion adopted for assessing foreign medical degrees. A few months back, the SLMC disqualified Chittagong University citing the substandard quality. This is not the first time they are assessing it. In medical education, theory training and clinical training are two different things. Clinical training is the costliest and the most difficult part. It is the most important part. One cannot become a journalist merely by learning theories. You need practical training such as analysis of issues and all. Without proper clinical training, they cannot boast of having quality medical teachers. 
What is the policy decision of GMOA on private medical education
We have a divided opinion on private medical education. On SAITM, we have a united opinion. Some say private medical education is needed. Some others say no to it. If there is private medical education as decided by the government, standards will have to be maintained. We cannot compromise on that. 

"If the students have the minimum qualifications, they can become doctors within a certain time period following the proper way. Before that, recruitments to SAITM should be stopped. Then legal action should be instituted against corrupt people"

How strong is the opinion in favour of private medical education
I do not think the majority is for it. It is like 60 percent against it and 40 percent for it. We cannot neglect that 40 percent. Yet, there is a common position that standards have to be maintained, be it at state universities or private universities.All are against SAITM.

However, there is a school of thought that SAITM students should be allowed to sit a common qualifying examination like the one meant for foreign medical graduates. What is your stance
First, they should be degree holders. The GMOA does not believe that SAITM has degree awarding status. Without having degrees, how can they ask for a qualifying examination to become doctors As for foreign graduates, they are degree holders sitting that examination. 
Anyway, how reasonable is it for you to take trade union action inconveniencing the public over this
We explained the strategy to be worked out. We have done it since 2010. They have failed to act till 2017. In our report, we said at that time: This will grow into a full-blown problem unless the government addresses it. After the ruling by the Court of Appeal, we gave time. We did awareness campaigns. We prepared for trade union action earlier. We did not go for it considering the plight of patients. We are compelled by the government to go for it. We gave time for it in January, February and March to take a decision. Now it is April. There are another couple of days left. This is the final fight. We will not relent till this problem is sorted out. The government is trying to handle this matter in an adamant manner. We met the President twice. He did not make any decision yet. We hope he will make a statement before Friday. We want the President to verify whether the report submitted by his committee is correct or not.
"the Chief Justice was removed in the way the government wanted. Now, they talk about how the law and order should be observed. Anyway, we have to think whether the relevant authorities serve justice to people"

Second U-turn in vain
	

There is a former Diyawanna member who functioned as the de facto authority on foreign affairs in his hay day.

Despite the past history of being a faithful lackey of the former strongman, the man made a political U-turn soon after the regime change in a bid to warm his way into the graces of the powers that be. However, this attempt failed and he had to languish for some time in the state-run lodge at Welikada.
Finding himself in a pathetic situation disowned by both sides, our hero made a complete turnaround once again. After sending feeler-after- feeler to his onetime mentor, the man made his appearance at the latters Wijerama residence quite recently.
Braving the angry frowns and remarks directed at him by the those present at the Wijerama residence at the time of his arrival, the man went down on his knees before the former strongman and begged his pardon. Although the former boss was not unkind to his erstwhile stooge, the others present had immediately turned hostile to him.
So the discredited politico had to make his exit from the place highly dejected, they say.

The Sexual Politics Sexual Politics MMDA Debate
	
Some Preliminary Thoughts
Women activists demand that reforms should address demands such as the minimum age of marriage and reform of divorce provisions.

The reformation of the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act (MMDA) has become a hot button topic over the past few months. There is expectation that the committee headed by Justice Saleem Marsoof which is tasked with making recommendations on the reform of the MMDA will make their report public soon. Women activists both within and from outside the Muslim community have made clear that the proposed reforms should address a number of demands.These demands relate (among other things) to the minimum age of marriage, the requirement for the womans consent for marriage to be mandatory, reform of divorce provisions, practices relating to dowry and alimony, and significant reform of the Quazi court system including allowing for women Quazis.[i]The debate over the reform of the MMDA has thus far been bracketed as an internal discussion for the Muslim community, particularly since Muslims are only allowed to marry under the MMDA and not the general marriage law of the country. However, in this short essay I will argue that the debate over the MMDA is also an invitation to a much broader discussion on the relationship between sex, politics, and governance in Sri Lanka. 


The problem of governing sex and desire is one of the core questions at the heart of the current debate over the MMDA. For example, activists campaigning for stipulating a minimum age of marriage under the MMDA emphasize the need to ensure the  bodily maturity and the ability to consent freely to marriage and sexual intercourse.[ii]In contrast, the All Ceylon Jamiyathul Ulama (ACJU)argue against stipulating the minimum age of marriage on the grounds (among others) that Ibn Hazm says: A father giving in marriage of his daughter before attaining puberty is possible and this is the evidence that Abu Bakkar (Radhi Allahu Anhu) gave Aishah (Radhi Allahu Anhu) on marriage to Prophet (Peace be upon him) when she was 6 years old).[iii]For reformists, the emphasis is on the right of an adult woman (who is at least 18) to determine when and who she marries and by extension, has sex with. Desire is the implicit (yet, silent) partner in this demand for a Muslim womans right to consent. Conservatives in contrast, emphasize religious teaching and cultural tradition to argue against the need to radically alter the conditions under which the Muslim community currently makes decisions about marriage and sex. What undergirds both these seemingly contradictory stances is the question of how to and who should regulate/ govern sex and desire. 

	The problem of governing sex and desire is one of the core questions at the heart of the current debate 
	
	
	It also reminds us of the need to consider how powerful groups within communities can collude with the very structures that they claim pose a threat to the community
	
	
	The campaign marked this out as a dastardly plot by radical elements in the Muslim community to alter the demography of the island with a view to eventually becoming the majority in the country
	

The concern with regulating sex and desire draws attention to the ways in which concerns about the population have increasingly become the focus of debates about the governance of minorities in the country. For example, it was only earlier this year that moves to include the decriminalization of homosexuality in the Human Rights Action Plan were rejected on grounds such as social concerns[iv], the need for a future generation[v]and the possibility of cultural destruction that could ensue.[vi] Similarly it was only a few years ago that a campaign was carried out on social media warning Sinhalese that certain Muslim department stores were allegedly handing out sweets that would result in impotency. The campaign marked this out as a dastardly plot by radical elements in the Muslim community to alter the demography of the island with a view to eventually becoming the majority in the country. Other social media campaigns have attempted to call on Sinhala women to procreate more frequently as a means of resisting the spread of the Muslim population in the country. There was also serious concern expressed at one point that the delay in publishing the final report of the 2012 Census was because the Muslim community now outnumbered the Sinhala community.[vii]These campaigns also echo long-standing concerns about declining fertility rates in the Sinhala community and its impact on recruitment to the military as well as the Buddhist clergy.[viii]What all these examples highlight is how the regulation of sex and desire is indexed towards exerting control over minorities and women in the country. The foregrounding of concerns about sex and desire draws our attention to the politics of governing and regulating populations and relationships between populations in Sri Lanka. Therefore, choosing to ignore or side-step the MMDA debate on the grounds that it is an internal discussion for the Muslim community fails to take into account the larger sexual politics at work in the country. 


The MMDA debate draws our attention to these larger questions about the function of sexual politics within the country.For example, the sexual curiosity of children is often proffered as an argument against increasing the minimum age of marriage among the Muslim community by law. However, at the heart of this argument is the question of to what extent law is an effective form of regulating sex and desire. We can see how the MMDA debate resonates with the conversation over the use of the death penalty as a way of regulating the sexual proclivities of child abusers and rapists. The reader may remember that at the time, the proponents of the death penalty strongly argued that the reintroduction of the death penalty would regulate the sexual desire of these criminal elements. A related question is also what purpose does the regulation of sex and desire within a community serve. These arguments over regulation are an attempt to establish control for those who wish to be identified as the gatekeepers of morality. The struggle by men to preserve their status as the gatekeepers of the morality of their community is indexed as a way of determining who can be considered a true Muslim. By establishing the parameters for inclusion and exclusion, these power struggles work towards concretising and defining membership in a community. If we remember that the earliest concerns with defining the parameters of cultural identity were rooted in attempts to further colonial control of subject populations, we begin to be far more suspicious of these projects of definition.


"The debate over the MMDA is also an invitation to a much broader discussion on the relationship between sex, politics, and governance in Sri Lanka. "

It also reminds us of the need to consider how powerful groups within communities can collude with the very structures that they claim pose a threat to the community. Therefore, supporting the moves for reforming the MMDA also affords a way of challenging many of the colonial legacies that continue to play a role in determining how the country is governed today. Contextualizing the MMDA debate within the struggle over the trajectory of Sri Lankas sexual politics makes it possible to open more pathways for understanding and coalition building between various groups around the country. Therefore, it is no longer possible to bracket off the MMDA struggle as a solely Muslim concern. When we begin to trace the flows of power, we begin to see how the MMDA reform debate has much broader repercussions. We see how the regulation of sex and desire are increasingly staked as the terrain for determining the relationship between law and social control. Nor can our stance on the MMDA be divorced from the question of how projects of definition are linked today to the drive to police womens bodies, sex, and desires. The debate also demonstrates how the logic of sexual regulation through insecurities about birth rates, infertility, and spread of minority cultures is increasingly coded in discussions on governing populations in Sri Lanka. In other words, the reform of the MMDA is not only circumscribed by the question of the rights of women within Muslim personal law. It challenges us to consider how the very terms of this debate continue to invoke the relationship between the disciplinary logic of sexual regulation and the production of populations for more malleable governance of the country. And when we begin to see that we can no longer afford to cast aside the questions raised by the MMDA reform movement as irrelevant to larger debates over rights, populations, and governance in Sri Lanka today.

They agreed to disagree
	

A senior purohita shouldering a heavy responsibility in respect of the countrys economy met a certain state purohita the other day.

The purohita is a Green party heavyweight, a recipient of honours for his performance par excellence. The state purohita, once Green-now-turned-Blue held key portfolios in the previous regime. He has now become a faithful follower of the Compassionate One. This state purohita hailing from the South has been in the forefront in the campaign against the Hambantota port deal.
The purohita asked the state one why he was attacking the Hambantota port deal through the media.
We are opposed to it on a matter of principle. We cannot agree to the idea of conceding the pound of flesh The policy of our party is to create something new for the country, not to concede part of our territory to foreigners, the state purohita replied.
We belong to the same government and its wrong for you to take up such a stand, the purohita pointed out.
No. We have taken up the correct stand, the state one asserted.
Having realized there was no purpose in pursuing the argument, the duo proceeded on their separate ways, they say.

Wear and tear of joints at a glance
	

An old lady is struggling to stand up. Even after standing, her grimace of pain says it all. She has unbearable knee joint soreness. The lady is fidgety with a walking stick. Her fingers are swollen over the joints, making it difficult to firmly grip the handle. Her legs are bowed at the knees  what we call bow legs is evident even from a distance. 
So what is the underlying cause of knee pain And what affects the hands and other joints simultaneously to create generalized joint pain And how does the body strangely select certain joints, damage them and spare some of the most weight bearing joints like the ankles from getting harmed 
This is a condition called osteoarthritis, the commonest type of arthritis out of nearly a hundred different types of diseases affecting the joints. We believe that osteoarthritis is the key joint disease among Sri Lankans, although nationwide surveys have never been done. Osteoarthritis is quite a common occurrence at our joint clinics. This is also known as wear and tear arthritis, although research has shown lately that its not just that. 

So who gets osteoarthritis
Osteoarthritis is more likely found in the following categories of patients: Women, people aged 40 or above, those who have had fractures or injuries in the joints, a familial tendency to have osteoarthritis, overweight people, people who do an occupation that puts additional burden on any joint and if there is another joint disease like rheumatoid arthritis. 

What are the symptoms of osteoarthritis
This is important to know, as not all patients might feel severe pain from within the joint. Pain is still the commonest complaint. Especially pain felt immediately after prolonged periods of rest; after being in a seated position for half an hour and pain that is worse at the end of the day. It could become so severe that it could even prevent patients from falling asleep. 
Another symptom might be stiffness, which again is felt after periods of rest. Stiffness might prevent you from properly moving your joints. Some patients recall instances where they had to put in an additional effort to move that particular joint.

Swelling is also a common occurrence. There are several different types of swellings that we observe. Certain joints get swollen when joint fluid collects inside a small space called the joint cavity. This fluid swelling increases the pressure within the joint and as a result, the skin bulges outwards. Theres also a bony swelling which occurs because of bone fragments called osteophytes. Unlike fluid swelling, this is felt if you press hard. 
The crackling sensation or bone grinding feeling is called crepitus. Crepitus is also felt by patients in most instances. This happens when you move your joint. Do note that even healthy individuals might feel a bit of crepitus. Crepitus alone doesnt mean you have osteoarthritis. 

How is osteoarthritis evaluated
The rheumatologists will first test how severe the osteoarthritis is, especially in the weight-bearing joints like hips, knees and ankles. The evaluation includes a detailed history, a complete examination of not just the joints that are affected but the healthy ones as well. During an examination, you might be asked to perform certain joint movements or the specialist might do them passively. 
Sometimes the consultant might order certain blood tests to see whether there is a bit of inflammation coming from within the joint. Inflammation is swelling related to increased blood supply to a certain part of your body. They might also order X-rays to see how well preserved the bone structure is. Joint ultrasound scans are very useful as well. 
Rarely do we have special imaging methods like CT scans and MRI scans to have a more clear view of the joint damage not visible though conventional images. 

What can be done for osteoarthritis
Whenever I tell a person who has osteoarthritis that fifty percent of the cure is achieved by the patients themselves, they shake their head in disbelief. Here in Sri Lanka, patients rely on their rheumatologists for a one hundred percent cure. Whereas in the developed world, self-help plays a major role in controlling the arthritis. 
Many proven treatment strategies are patient-based ones and rheumatologists are there just for guidance. It is a well-known fact that joint protection strategies and exercise can ease off the pain completely. 
There are several different types of medication that help patients control the symptoms of osteoarthritis. Out of these, painkillers play a major role. Starting from ointments, paracetamol and non-steroidanti-inflammatory drugs, we might even prescribe opioid analgesics for severe pain. Certain drugs which relax the muscles also help. 
Joint injections consist of a mixture of steroids and pain-relieving medication. Injections are very useful to rapidly bring down the swelling and provide great relief. 

Some of the newer methods of controlling symptoms
There are more than ten different and novel ways of treating osteoarthritis. As I said, joint protection strategies are useful in preventing further damage. 
We use braces/guards/splints that are worn over joints to control unwanted movement. Again, these come in various types and sizes. We also recommend supports to be worn with your footwear. 
Muscle strengthening if properly done, protects the joints that lie beneath. There is proven evidence that this might even halt the joint from getting deformed. Aerobic exercises, cycling and swimming are very useful in treating osteoarthritis. Even Tai Chi which is all about gradual limb movements while maintaining body balance was studied and proven to alleviate joint pain. 
An electrical impulse to be applied over the affected joints called TENS therapy is also very popular in the west. Guided physiotherapy is also useful to diminish symptoms in osteoarthritis. 
Certain nutritional supplements like glucosamine and chondroitin, compounds normally found in joint cartilage, may improve damaged cartilage, according to some studies. Weight reduction is known to improve pain, especially of the weight-bearing joints. Sometimes patients with osteoarthritis need early referral to orthopaedic surgeons for joint operations. There are numerous surgical methods of treating worn-out joints and patients are involved in selecting what suits them best.

When elephants fight grass gets hurt
	
A big row broken out between the political chief and the executive head in the central province has thrown the provincial administration into a melting pot, they say.

The row had begun when the madam heading the executive had invalidated some appointments made by the political chief saying that the latter had made them without first consulting her. Now the madam has made it a practice to countermand practically all decisions made by the political chief just to spite the latter who incidentally happens to be a close kinsman of hers.
Meanwhile, the powerful madam is said to have revealed that she is in the process of preparing a dossier on the misdeeds of the political chief to be sent to Number One in yahapalanaya.
Over one hundred appointments made by the political chief have gone into limbo due to the madams refusal to give them her formal okay, they say.

Will take it up with India if IPKF culpable: AI
	
If the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) personnel were found culpable of disappearances in Sri Lanka, the issue would be taken up with the Indian Government, Amnesty International (AI) General Secretary Salil Shetty said in Colombo today.
During a news briefing, the visiting General Secretary was asked whether the AI would take up the issue with the Indian government if it was found that IPKF was guilty of cases of disappearances during its stay in Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1990.
As a response, he said there has to be a proper investigation on what happened and who is accountable.
If there is an investigation and at least the culpability of actors, we will take it up (with the Indian Government). Thats what Amnesty International does. We dont spare anybody. You can be sure about that, he said.
Referring to the two year extension given by the UN Human Rights Council to Sri Lanka to implement the UN Resolution, Shetty said the Government should utilize the extension to take action in order to deliver justice to the victims of the conflict and not to procrastinate.(Lahiru Pothmulla)

WPC gets barbecued
	
 Western Province Council (WPC) UPFA member Janaka Weliwatte yesterday objected to having a Barbeque lunch at the council premises and overturned the Barbeque grill, and some tables and chairs.
Weliwatte thereafter had lied down inside the restaurant of the council insisting that he would not get up until the cost of this extravagant lunch was revealed.
As this was the final meeting of the council chaired by the Chairman Sunil Wijerathna before the Sinhala and Hindu New Year, a special lunch had been organized for the Councillors, staff and the journalists at the restaurant of the council, there had been two Barbeque grills with meat being cooked from morning.
The smoke that had emitted from the two burners had covered the entire meeting hall and outside area. This was continuing with the ongoing debate of the council on private universities.
Weliwatte who resented this type of preparations for the special lunch, had overturned the Barbeque Grill and some tables, demanding who had organized this sort of thing and what is the cost of it.
He refused to get up from the place where he was lying until they inform the cost of this Barbeque. Some crockery and the cutlery that had been brought in for the lunch was also damaged. (Muditha Dayananda)
