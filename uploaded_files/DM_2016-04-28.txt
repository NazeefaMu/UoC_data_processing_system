CV, MR instigating racism: JVP
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) alleged today certain politicians in the North and South were instigating racism in the country to cover up their inefficiencies, as a shield to the rising protest against them and to suppress the burning issues.
JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva said racism in the north and south should be defeated as it was detrimental to the people in the north and the south.
Northern Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran is trying to instigate racism in the north by passing resolutions in the Northern Provincial Council, while former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and his group were trying to do it in the south. This does not yield any benefits to the people other than disadvantages to them, he said.
Mr. Silva said the resolution, which proposed a federal system for the North and East would not find solutions to the issues of the Tamil people.
He said instigating racism in the past led to the 30-year war, which caused lot of damage to property and people.
He said that it was a disaster that bankrupt politicians, having failed to find solutions to peoples issues, were trying to seek blessings of the racism again.(Ajith Siriwardana)

Media Ministry Secy. sends missive to media over Joint Opp.
	
Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Ministry Secretary Nimal Bopage in a media release today said that there were reports of some media organisations and journalists engaging in what he called illegal and unethical use of media to promote a section of the MPs belonging to one main Governing party, who call themselves the Joint Opposition.
He warned the journalists that such misuse could make them legally liable.
The Government and the Opposition of current Parliament had been clearly characterised today. In this scenario, I have received reports that some media institutions and journalists are promoting a collective called Joint Opposition created by several MPs without the input of neither the Opposition Leader nor the Chief Opposition Whip.
Reports say the Joint Opposition is engaged in an organised political propaganda and some media aiding the promotion of it without any consideration, Mr. Bopage said in the media release.
He said even the Speaker had pointed out the fault in the concept of Joint Opposition and said the professional integrity of the experienced, reputed and mature journalists, would be severely damaged by such media exploitation.
Misuse of media in this manner sets bad and illegal precedent and journalists could be legally liable. Various persons would attempt to accomplish their narrow gains through misuse of media in the future. Therefore, I request journalists to follow their conscience to put an end to media misuse and to preserve thriving media freedom, he said.
Mr. Bopage went on to note that the Good Governance Government was able to improve media freedom within a short span of time.
This was evident by the latest international index on media freedom as the countrys rank was improved by 24 notches only within a year, he said.
Several attempts to contact Secretary Mr. Bopage by the Daily Mirror for clarification failed. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Missive not to use 'Jt. Opp' tag not by govt.:Karunathilake
	
The missive issued to the media not to use the term 'Joint Opposition' was not an official statement of either the Government or the Ministry, but merely a request letter issued by the Ministry Secretary based on his personal views, Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said.
He said he, too, received a copy of the letter from Ministry Secretary, Nimal Bopage, but it reached him after he released it to the media. I was in Galle when I received it and as I went through it, I realized there was nothing serious contained in it, the minister told Daily Mirror.
When asked if a Secretary was allowed to issue such a letter, he reiterated that it was simply a letter sent by the Secretary to the media based on his personal views.
Commenting on the use of the name Joint Opposition, the minister said the matter would discussed in Parliament before coming to a decision on the issue.There is no need to panic. The letter is binding. Misleading interpretations should not be made into the matter. We are committed to establishing media freedom in the country and wont allow anyone to harass the media, he said.
Earlier the Ministry Secretary, in a missive, said that there were reports of some media organisations and journalists misusing the freedom given to the media to promote the Joint Opposition and said such journalists could be legally liable. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

NPC wants Regional Council for hill country
	
Apart from the Federal structure and the re-merger of the northern and eastern provinces, the Northern Provincial Council (NPC) has proposed a separate administrative unit called Upcountry Regional Council for Tamils living in the central part of the country, it is learnt.
The NPC, controlled by the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), unanimously adopted this resolution calling for the implementation of political proposals.
NPC member M.K. Sivajilingam told the Daily Mirror that it had been proposed to set up the North-East State.
He said a separate autonomous region had been proposed within the proposed State for Muslims living there.
We will unveil the proposals to the public on Saturday. We have sought power sharing based on Federal structures prevailing elsewhere in the world. We have not asked anything more other than that, he said.
Meanwhile, Eelam Peoples Democratic Party (EPDP) also endorsed these proposals in the NPC.
Only the two Sinhalese members, representing the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA), were opposed to the resolution. (Kelum Bandara)

Opp. Leader should give prior notice when visiting Army camp: Ruwan
	
The leader of the opposition has been advised to give prior notice when visiting an army camp in the future, said State Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardene.
The army had advised the leader of the opposition that he should give notice to the army at least a day or two prior to his visiting a camp, Mr. Wijewardene told journalists at the Mahinda Rajapaksa Maha Vidyalaya in Homagama last morning.
He said that the opposition leader had the right to visit any place in the country at any time, but that he should give prior notice if he intends visiting a military camp.
We dont consider this a major issue as Mr. Sampanthan did not force his way into the camp. He had intervened in an issue faced by the people of Kilinochchi, and neither the police nor the army had done any harm to him. They had only told him to give prior notice before visiting a military camp, he said, explaining what had taken place during a recent incident where Mr. Sampanthan had entered a military camp.
Mr. Wijewardene said nothing would be done to affect the unitary status of the country. The government will not allow any challenges to the unitary status or sovereignty of the country, but will work out a mechanism of devolving power with the consent of all parties, he said.
The Northern Provincial Council will have to work together with the central government no matter what decision it takes at any time, he said. (Yohan Perera)

People should rise up against tax increases: MR
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said today that people should rise up as one against the impending tax increases because the yahapalana Government was trying to find the money for their political survival through increased taxes on the very people they deceived in order to win power.
Mr. Rajapaksa said the Government was going to increase taxes because there was no money to continue implementing the reckless pledges they made to the voting public to win power.
They actually expected vast amounts of Western aid to flow in to sustain their Government. But no country gives aid to fulfill election pledges, he said in a statement.

The statement made by Media Ministry Secretary on the Joint Opposition indicated the bankrupt status of the Government and how helpless the Government had become before the Joint Opposition, National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader and MP Wimal Weerawansa said today.
While condemning the statement, the MP said there was no need to ask for permission from the Secretary of the Media Ministry on using a name and asked what his issue was over using the name Joint Opposition.
Even the United National Party (UNP), when in the Opposition formed a Joint Opposition with several other parties. Then Government said nothing and no statement was issued by Ministry Secretaries, he said.
