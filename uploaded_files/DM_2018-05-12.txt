Better Wifi facilities at BIA in three months: Minister
	
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva said yesterday steps would be taken to provide Wifi facilities at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) within three months.
Responding to JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake, who said Wi-Fi facility at the BIA was very poor, the minister told parliament that he was not aware of such a situation and that he had instructed the officials to provide the facility within three months.
The MP said even the world's poorest airport was equipped with Wi-Fi facilities whereas in Sri Lanka, passengers had to wait in long queues to get the boarding pass scanned to obtain the password.
The minister said the Wi-Fi facility was available at two points at the arrival and departure lounges and admitted it was not sufficient. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

A biopic on Savitri in both Tamil and Telugu released
Savitri regarded as a great actress...
Dulquer and Keerthi receive rave reviews


By
D.B.S.Jeyaraj
Film stars often act the roles of real persons in what is known as Biopics or biographical movies.
Biopics are usually about illustrious and interesting historical figures. Actors and actresses enacting such roles get praised if their performances are brilliant enough to project those historical figures in a realistic manner on screen.
While artistes acting in biographical movies about noteworthy people are an established norm, it is very seldom that a real-life film actor is considered worthy enough to be portrayed in a biopic on screen.
One such film made about a great actress, who sparkled brightly in the South Indian film firmament decades ago, had a worldwide release a few days ago.

Savitri ruled the roost in Telugu and Tamil filmdom for nearly 15 years in the fifties and sixties of the last century. She was hailed as the finest actress of her time and earned the laudatory sobriquets Mahanati (Great Actress) in Telugu and Nadigaiyar Thilagam (Doyenne of Actresses) in Tamil

The film Mahanadi made in the Telugu language hit the screens on May 9th. Its Tamil version Nadigaiyar Thilagam was released on May 11th. The film is about yesteryear actress K. Savitri, who was known as Savitri Ganesh after she married Tamil romantic actor Gemini Ganesan, also known as R. Ganesh.
Savitri in an acting career of more than three decades acted in 248 films in five languages. The breakdown was - Telugu- 136; Tamil -90; Kannada -09; Hindi -07 and Malayalam -06.
Savitri ruled the roost in Telugu and Tamil filmdom for nearly 15 years in the fifties and sixties of the last century. She was hailed as the finest actress of her time and earned the laudatory sobriquets Mahanati (Great Actress) in Telugu and Nadigaiyar Thilagam (Doyenne of Actresses) in Tamil.
The filmmakers have most suitably used those titles Mahanati and Nadigaiyar Thilagam for the Telugu and Tamil films respectively.
During British rule, several regions in India were formed into territorial units known by the term Presidency. Much of what is known today as Andhra Pradesh together with Tamil Nadu comprised the bulk of the Madras Presidency then.
With Tamil and Telugu being the dominant languages in the Madras Presidency most films were made simultaneously in the Tamil and Telugu languages and released together. The bi-lingual films were made in Chennai city then known as Madras.
After the creation of Andhra Pradesh State under the linguistic re-structuring of States principle, Telugu filmmakers began moving to studios in Hyderabad and Vijayawada in the newly created State.
Savitri and other famous Telugu artistes like A. Nageswara Rao, N.T. Rama Rao, S. V. Ranga Rao, Bhanumathy, Anjali Devi, Jamuna, Devika, Sowcar Janaki, S.Varalaxmi et al acted in both Telugu and Tamil films in those days.
Savitri herself made a name for herself by acting in Tamil -Telugu films like Devadas, Chandraharam, Maaya Bazaar and Missiyammaah.
In that context, the making of a biopic on Savitri in both Tamil and Telugu and releasing it simultaneously does seem quite appropriate.

Controversial MarriageTo Gemini Ganesan
Though the film has been in theatres only for a few days all indications are that it will be a blockbuster. This is because Savitri the actress was extremely popular with Tamil and Telugu audiences during her time and enjoyed what could be termed as a cult following at the peak of her career.
Savitris screen persona was very lovable and fans both male and female, were infatuated with her. Rising from humble beginnings, she had reached great heights as a popular film star through her acting skills, dedication and hard work. Her controversial marriage to Kaadhal Mannan (King of Romance) Gemini Ganesan captured the imagination of all young lovers.
Yet, her life ultimately ended as a tragedy. Her foray into film production and direction brought about financial ruin and estrangement from her husband. In a bid to drown her sorrows, Savitri the social drinker became an incurable alcoholic. She died a few days before her 46th birthday after being in a diabetic coma for more than 18 months. The story of Savitri was known widely in South India due to numerous articles and books. Thus the film is proving to be an irresistible magnet to filmgoers.
Savitri was of Telugu ethnicity and the younger of two daughters. She was born on January 4th, 1936 in a small village called Chirravurru in the Guntur District in the present day Indian State of Andhra Pradesh. At the time of her birth during British rule, Guntur was part of the Madras Presidency.
Savitris parents were Kuruvaiyya and Subhadramma Reddy. Her father Kuruvaiyya Reddy died when she was only six months old. Savitris mother Subhadramma took Savitri and her elder sister Maruti and moved to her husbands elder brother Kommareddy Venkatramiah Chowdhury and his wife Durgammaas home. Thereafter Savitris paternal uncle K.V. Chowdhury became the guardian of both sisters.
Discovering that Savitri had a flair for dancing and acting her paternal uncle let her participate at a very young age in dance-dramas staged by a theatre company.
As the film industry started flourishing in the post-independence period, Savitris uncle Chowdhury began seeking openings in films for her.

The family relocated to Chennai in order to facilitate Savitris entry into films. Savitri got her first break in 1950 through a minor role in the Telugu film Samsaaram. After getting a few more films doing minor roles, Savitri got her major break in 1952 through maestro L.V. Prasad, who directed Pelli Chesi Choodu in Telugu and its Tamil equivalent Kalyanam Pannip paar.
Savitri was the second heroine in the film starring N.T. Rama Rao and G.Varalaxmi.
Thereafter she got to play the lead roles in some more films. In 1953 came Devdas/Devadasu made in Tamil and Telugu by director Vedantam Ragavaiah.
Savitri was the heroine and A. Nageswara Rao the hero in both films. The film was a roaring success. Savitri was now established as a heroine in Tamil and Telugu films. She began to get paired with almost all the leading actors in films including her future husband Gemini Ganesan, who was earlier known as R. Ganesh in films.

Full-FledgedLove Affair
Her first film with him was Manam Poala Maangalyam in 1953. It was directed by
P. Pullaiyah.
Gemini was already married to Alamelu called Bopji and had children by her. This did not deter the man who was regarded as the king of romance on screen as well as off-screen. Both Ganesh and Savitri were struck by Cupids darts while acting together in Manam pool Maangalyam.
It developed into a full-fledged love affair in 1955 when both acted in Missiammaah directed by L.V. Prasad. By this time R. Ganesh had become Gemini Ganesan.
When Savitris family objected strongly to this liaison, she ran off from home. Gemini and Savitri married secretly at the Chamundeswari temple in Mysore (Now Mysooru) in a Hindu ritual conducted by a Brahmin priest, where Ganesan tied the Thaali around Savitris neck.
Gemini who was then living with wife Alamelu and children at Nungambakkam set up a second home with Savitri in a rented house at Abhiraamapuram.
Later Savitri bought extensive property in TNagar and built a modern mansion. Gemini began shuttling between both houses. The couple had two children a girl Vijaya Chamundeswari and a son Sathishkumar.
Chamundeswari is a physiotherapist in India while Sathishkumar is a computer engineer in the USA. Sathish is the only son Gemini had. All his other children were daughters.
Meanwhile, Savitris film career blossomed and she soon became the top female star in Tamil and Telugu films. While pairing with leading male actors, Savitri also acted in many films where the story revolved around the chief female character played by her.
Film scripts were written with Savitri in mind. She received top billing in film advertisements. Many box office hits owed their success to Savitri more than the main male actor. She became a highly paid star on par with her male counterparts.
Savitri and Gemini were very popular in Sri Lanka known formerly as Ceylon too. The couple had many fans from all communities in the Island. Savitri, in particular, had a lot of female fans. I remember Gemini and Savitri arriving by plane from India at the Ratmalana Airport in the early sixties.
They were the chief guests at a cultural event named Silamboli or Tone of the anklets. Hundreds of fans mobbed them at the Airport. The newspapers in all three languages published photographs of their arrival. In later years Gemini Ganesan had come several times to Sri Lanka.
In 1978 Gemini along with actress Rajshree attended a musical show at the Sugathadasa stadium as chief guests.

SavitrisGold-Clad Feet
Savitri bought a lot of property, jewellery, motor vehicles and expensive sarees with her earnings. She flouted convention and created controversy by wearing anklets made of gold.
Photographs of Savitris gold-clad feet were widely circulated. Since it was not customary to wear gold on ones feet, Savitri was severely criticised for this. Even though she wore gold on her feet, Savitri had a golden heart. She was a great philanthropist who donated lavishly to deserving causes. She also helped several needy people by paying for their education, medical treatment and wedding expenses.
Savitri was regarded as a great actress on equal terms with the legendary Sivaji Ganesan. Thus when Sivaji was honoured with the title Nadigar Thilagam or Doyen of Male actors, Savitri was bestowed the female equivalent Nadigaiyar Thilagam (Doyenne of Actresses).

With Tamil and Telugu being the dominant languages in the Madras Presidency most films were made simultaneously in the Tamil and Telugu languages and released together. The bi-lingual films were made in Chennai city then known as Madras

She acted with Sivaji in films like Annayin Aanai. Kaathavaraayan, Raththa Thilagam, Paasa Malar, Padithaal Mattum Poathumaa, Navarathri, Thiruvilaiyaadal.
With M.G. Ramachandran she acted in films like Mahadevi, Paris and Vaettaikkaaran.
However, some of her most memorable films were with her husband Gemini Ganesan.
Missiammaa, Yaar Paiyan, Maayaa Bazaar, Kappaloatiya Thamizhan, Paava Mannippu, Paarthaal Pasi Theerum, Paatha Kaanikkai, Hello Mr Zamindhar, Kaathiruntha Kangal. Poojaikku Vantha Malar, Aayiram Roobai and Katpaham were some of these films with both.
Fans loved seeing these real-life partners playing lovers or acting as husband and wife on screen. Sadly the loving Gemini-Savitri couple got separated after some years.
What had happened was that the talented Savitri formed her own film company and began producing and directing films. After the first film Kulanthai Ullam flopped, Gemini began advising her not to make any more films. But egged on by a group of self -serving sycophants scrounging off her, Savitri spurned Geminis advice and went ahead making films.
This led to heated arguments resulting in a permanent split between husband and wife.
Savitri went ahead and made the film Praaptham which she directed, produced and acted in. The movie crashed drastically at the box office. A few Telugu films made by her also bombed at the box -office.
As a result, Saviri had to sell off all her houses, estates, jewellery and vehicles to offset her financial losses. She moved to a rented house and travelled about in three-wheelers and cycle rickshaws. She also started acting in minor roles and also began playing a mother in films.

Unconscious In a Diabetic Comafor 19 Months
Complicating matters further was her health. Savitri was a diabetic and also suffered from high blood pressure (Hypertension). Furthermore, she had become an alcoholic. It was her husband Gemini who made her imbibe liquor first at a diplomatic function. Thereafter she had become an occasional social drinker. However, after her financial losses and separation with her husband, Savitri turned to hard liquor in a big way for solace and also to drown her sorrows.
Her health began deteriorating. In May 1980 she collapsed at a hotel in Mysore, where she had gone for a film shoot. She was brought to Chennai and hospitalised. She was in a diabetic coma and was unconscious. Her estranged husband Gemini returned to her bedside and looked after her medical bills. She lay in a coma for nearly 19 months and finally passed away on December 26th, 1981.
This then was Nadigaiyar Thilagam Savitris sad story. Her tale was widely known thanks to numerous articles and books written about Savitri.
So, when a film was made about her so many years after Savitris demise there was tremendous public interest.
The titular role of Mahanati/Nadigaiyar Thilagam denoting Savitri is played by a young actress Keerthi Suresh, who is of mixed parentage with a Malayalee father and Tamil mother.
The key role of actor Gemini Ganesan/Ganesh is played by Dulquer Salman the son of Malayalam Mega Star Mammootty.
Dulquer Salman and Keerthi Suresh act in Tamil and Malayalam films. In a bid to cash in on their popularity with Kerala audiences the film has been dubbed in Malayalam also. Both Dulquer Salman and Keerthi Suresh have received rave reviews and much kudos for their performances.


Finest Performance Of Keerthy Suresh
Keerthy Suresh has excelled in what could be regarded as the finest performance of the 25-year-old stars cinematic career.
She has brought Savitri to life on the screen. The greatest praise came from Savitris daughter Vijayachamundeswari, who observed emotionally that seeing Keerthy on screen in the role was just like seeing her mother and that the performance was perfect.
Prosthetics was used to make Keerthi look chubby and fat like Savitri.
She wears 120 costumes in the film. The same hairstyles, Saree designs and jewellery used by Savitri have been replicated. Keerthi also consulted Savitris daughter and obtained an insight into Savitris facial expressions and mannerisms. She displays at least 12 of Savitris unique gestures and movements in the film.
Other roles are essayed by Samantha, Vijay Devarakonda, Rajendra Prasad, Prakash Raj, Bhanupriya, Shalini Pandey and Malavika Nair.
In addition to these character roles, there are a number of other cameos by reputed artistes appearing as actors, actresses, directors, producers, script writers and cinematographers, who were contemporaries of Savitri and interacted with her. For instance, Akkineni Nageswara Rao was the lead actor with whom Savitri acted in many Telugu films. In the Savitri film, the role is played by Nageswara Raos grandson Naga Chaitanya, who is a popular actor himself.
The 177-minute film is directed by Nag Ashwin. His wife Priyanka Dutt, Sister in law Swapna Dutt and father in law C. Ashwini Dutt are among the producers. The screenplay based on Savitris life is by Siddharth Sivasamy, while the dialogues in Tamil and Telugu are by Madhan Karky and Madhav Burra respectively. There are five full songs in the film. There are also a number of tracks in bits and pieces from song sequences in films acted by Savitri. Music for both background score as well as the main songs is composed by Mickey J. Meyer. He has tried to bring about the tone and tenor of the music prevalent during Savitris time.

Samantha Acts as Journalist Maduravani
Director Nag Ashwin has adopted a novel device to relate the story. Savitri is in a coma and a journalist Madhuravani and photographer Vijay Anthony try to unravel her past and probe her life story. The story of Savitris life is narrated through a series of inter-related flashbacks going back and forth. Madhuravani is played by Samantha Ruth Prabhu, who recently married the actor Naga Chaitanya. Vijay Anthony is enacted by Vijay Deverakonda. Savitris life from childhood to demise over the time period from the forties to the eighties of the 20th century is covered in the narrative. The tale to a very great extent is told through the journalist Madhuravani played by Samantha. Editing is by Kotagiri Venkateshwara Rao. The art director is Avinash, while the production designer is Shivam. Great effort has gone into making this biopic a flawless period movie. 42 sets were created to shoot the various scenes. Among these were settings such as the now non-existent Vijaya-Vahini studio and Parrys Corner of an earlier vintage.
One remarkable creation was the studio floor within floor set for the scenes of vintage movie Maayaa Bazaar.
Every prop and item used was acquired or constructed with meticulous detail. These ranged from the wooden clapper boards used earlier, the camera and equipment of an earlier vintage and costumes and vehicles of a by-gone era.
The cinematographer is a Hispanic from the USA Dani Sanchez Lopez. Much of the movie was shot on celluloid to get the feel of an earlier vintage. Many sequences are shot in a grainy style to depict the Technicolor of those days.
Scenes are in colour and in black and white and are interwoven seamlessly. Different types of lenses and filters have been used at different times. Organic lighting has been used at times and some shots are taken by hand-held cameras.
The most striking feature about the films cinematography is the use of colour in the filmy narration.

Colours Depict Phases in Savitris Life
The colours change through each phase or segment of Savitris life. Lush greens and sepia browns are used to depict the village life in Guntur where Savitri came from. When she migrates to the urban studios and city life, the colours blossom into warmer pinks, oranges and yellows and reds.
When Savitri falls in love, red and maroons start infiltrating into the frame.
As Savitri becomes successful in her career and prospers, there are brighter hues golden tones. When people get jealous and envious of Savitris success there are shades of blue-green and green. As her life falters there are shades of blue to illustrate her weaknesses. There are crimson, mauve, purple and blue in darker tomes as Savitri deteriorates. Low-key lighting, deep shadows and circling camera work enhance the mood of pathos. The biopic about Savitri is a profound cinematic creation.
To those of us who grew up seeing Savitri on screen and appreciated her acting, the decline of her personal life has been most distressing. The rise and fall of Nadigaiyar Thilagam Savitri in real life is the stuff from which many melodramatic movies can be made.
It is to the credit of the director Nag Ashwin that he has genuinely attempted to present an authentic account of Savitris life. The greatest praise he has received for his work is the compliment by Savitris daughter Vijayachamundeswari that Mahanati/Nadigaiyar Thilagam was the first time that the story of her mother Savitris life has been told so truthfully by anyone.

Cabinet must decide on any bus fare hike: NTC
	
The decision to increase the bus fare has to be taken by the Cabinet, National Transport Commission (NTC) said yesterday.
NTC Chairman M.A.P. Hemachandra told Daily Mirror, the NTC will not dance to the tune of any bus organization as it was a national matter.
Responding to claims made by Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association (LPBOA) President Gemunu Wijeratne, Mr. Hemachandra said he was not informed of any 10 per cent increase in bus fares and added that Mr. Wijeratne had no authority to do so.
The recent fuel price hike seems to have become an issue for buses running with kerosene. Through recent media exposures we were informed that there are a large number of buses using kerosene with diesel. For the others, the diesel price increase cannot be a big issue, he said.
Mr. Hemachandra said the NTC has an expert committee to decide on bus fares and the subject minister has to take the final decision.
However, he said, as the fuel price increase was a Cabinet decision, the increase in bus fares should be also be decided by the Cabinet. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Joint opposition MP Bandula Gunawardane yesterday alleged that the Finance Minister had disclosed the Central Bank's annual report to the media a week ago even before submitting it in parliament.
He said according to the Financial Laws Act, the report should be first submitted in Parliament, before disclosing it to any other institution.
"Although the report should have been presented in Parliament after it was submitted to the Finance Minister, it was only tabled in Parliament a week later. This is a bad precedent," the MP said.
The Speaker requested the Finance Minister to look into this issue and provide a copy of the report to the MPs. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

CHANDRAKALA RATNAYAKE (nee SENANAYAKE) Life has been dull in your absence
	
Time shall heal they say, but to me, time has only been intensifying the aching wound of my beloved mothers absence in this world. She was the very special person who brought light into my life, from the day I was born. She was there not only during times of joy, but in times of deep sorrow and struggle. Even though her absence was felt throughout one whole year, I still feel her ray of light falling on me from heaven above. But, I admit with pain that the challenging moments have been appalling without Ammis presence. And, the dainty moments of joy have been dull in her absence.
My beloved mother departed this world, on May 12th 2017, after courageously fighting an ailment that was discovered, treated for, and persisted for three short months. Her condition left my father and me thinking that the duration of her illness would be minimal. The robust, courageous, good-looking and strong-willed lady in my mother did bear the pain without complaint, given the nature of her ailment. She set an example by not giving up until her very last breath. She was treated at the Coronary Care Unit of the Kurunegala Hospital after she was transferred from the Oncology Unit. My memory holds on tight with desolation, to the last nine hours that my mother fought for dear life, gasping. My mother was one of those who healed stronger during a crises.
My mother lived a complete and dynamic life. She was the fourth among the seven siblings of the Senanayake family from Kurunegala. Having obtained her education at Maliyadeva Girls College in Kurunegala, she joined Hayleys Group back in the 1960s, where she served for nine years. While in school and in later years she played basketball under the guidance of All-India Basketball Coach Mr. P. Chelladurai. After tying the knot with my father Ananda Ratnayake in 1973, she pursued a career at Marhaba Travels in Sharjah, U.A.E. where she served for several years before returning to Sri Lanka. There was a period in her life when she along with my father lived with me, in California U.S.A. However she returned to Sri Lanka before passing away.
The grief caused by my mothers demise has been continuously suffocating me throughout the past year and also choking me from time to time. This agony wraps my heart like an anaconda crushing the bones of its prey. Death has caused a heartache in me that none can heal. People say that time shall heal, but in reality, time apparently does not heal anything. Time, just has taught me how to live with the pain.
I am aware that my mother is watching over me and appachchi from somewhere above. You are my Mona Lisa and you will always be beautiful, in my eyes!

Checking revenue licence via SMS: Police dismiss FB claims
	
Dismissing a claim spread through a Facebook post, Police spokesman Ruwan Gunasekera said yesterday that vehicle registration details obtained via SMS cannot be accepted when the drivers are not in possession of revenue licences or the driving licence.
SP Gunasekara told the Daily Mirror that the drivers should be able to produce the revenue and driving licences.
A Facebook post was circulating claiming that police can accept the reply message on revenue licence and driving licence received from the Provincial Department of Motor Traffic as valid proof of those licences, in case of drivers not possessing them at the time of police officers demanding them.
It said that drivers after sending the message DMT<space>RLS<space> vehicle no to 1919 will receive the relevant vehicles revenue license number and its expiry date.
Furthermore, the Facebook post said, by showing the SMS details drivers can prove the identity of the vehicle and the driver without inconveniencing the traffic police.
However, SP Gunasekera said according to the Motor Traffic Act, a driver should be able to show his vehicles revenue license and his driving license.
The police cannot verify the real identity of a vehicle via text messages and that will only help to prove whether the vehicles driving license details are up to date, he added. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Chithrani Damayanthie Fernando She was a living saint
	
Those we love go away 
They walk beside us everyday 
Years may pass and fade away   
But memories of loved ones are here to stay 
1st May 2018 marked 12 months after she departed to be with the Lord. 

We were all made to look poorer by the untimely demise of one of its most humble and helpful persons. The ever smiling and lovable character Chithrani Damayanthie Fernando came into my life 37 years ago when I got married to the cousin of Damayanthies husband Warren. Her affection was contagious. Her care and concern were irrespective of considerations of class, caste or creed, and no recipient could ever resist responding to that disarming love which knew no bounds in transmission. Immense were the acts of her love, sharing and feeling 
for people both rich and poor. 

A product of Methodist College she never lost her common touch as she was able to move with the highs and lows of society. She was a prominent participant in all family activities in which she saw her stewardship prosper. 

Damayanthie was a hands-on individual who would do her utmost to alleviate the hardships faced by the underprivileged with her persuasive tactics. She would walk the extra mile to help anyone in need. 

Aggression was never in her vocabulary. She was a beautiful lady who had a beautiful heart. She had compassion, understanding, love, joy, happiness and the readiness to forgive and forget. She was courageous and never hesitated to stand up for justice. 

I will never forget her hospitality when we were experiencing a crisis in our lives in 1988. Her home was our home during that crisis period. The bedroom of Warren and Damayanthie were given to me and my wife and I have no words to describe the way she treated us. Early morning she would bring the cup of tea and in the night a glass of milk without fail. 

We as a family will feel the void left by our loving cousins absence. She was more of a sister than a cousin to Roshani and me. We were blessed to have her in our lives. We will remember the occasions she helped us, especially those calls to check after a court hearing regarding my cases. 

Many would speak of her and share their thoughts of her remarkable and unshakable faith in God. How can anyone forget that smile of hers, which always meant so much to those who met her. We here on earth, will always love and miss our loving cousin so much. I would like to extend our heartfelt condolences to her dearly beloved husband, Warren. who stood by her at all times and to her children Gayathrie, Gayan and Ramesh 
Death is not the greatest loss in life; the greatest loss is what dies within while we live. 
She was indeed a living Saint. 
Damayanthie, may you rest in peace.

Difficult to manage without a deputy: Speaker
	
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said yesterday it was difficult for him to manage without a deputy speaker.
He said this when the matter of a deputy speaker was being discussed by the MPs.
I hope the President will take steps to appoint a new deputy speaker as it is difficult for me to manage the affairs of the House single handedly, the Speaker said and added that he had officially informed President Maithripala Sirisena on the need to appoint a new deputy speaker but had not received a response yet.
He said he was ready to work with any one and did not care whether the deputy speaker was from the Opposition or from the ruling party.
It does not matter who it is as long as I can work with him. All I want is a neutral approach from him or her, the Speaker said.
UNP MP Nalin Bandara asked the Speaker about the delay in appointing a new deputy speaker. What is keeping you from appointing a new deputy speaker now that the then Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala had resigned from the post, he said.
MP Bandula Gunawardene said his colleague in the opposition S. B. Dissanayake had clearly stated that Mr. Sumathiapala could be reinstated.
Mr. Dissanayake said on Wednesday that the SLFP had the right to appoint a new deputy speaker and that Mr. Sumathiapla could be reinstated. There is no rule that both the speakers post and the deputy speakers post should be held by the ruling party, he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

French FM slams unacceptable  US sanctions on Iran
	

French Foreign Minister on Thursday condemned as unacceptable the United States for reimposing sanctions against foreign companies trading with Iran, in comments that expose the deepening rift between Washington and its European allies on the issue. 
On Tuesday, US President Donald Trump announced he was pulling out of a landmark deal curbing Irans nuclear program and re-introducing sanctions on the Islamic republic and those who trade with it. 
The decision overturned years of painstaking diplomacy and left European allies scrambling to save the hard-fought deal. Washington has given European firms doing business in Iran up to six months to wind up investments or risk US sanctions and they are also forbidden from signing any new contracts with Iran. 
On Thursday Frances top diplomat Jean-Yves Le Drian slammed those conditions, saying Washington needed to negotiate with its European allies on any sanctions that might affect
their companies. 
We feel that the extraterritoriality of their sanction measures are unacceptable, he told the French
daily Le Parisien. 
The Europeans should not have to pay for the withdrawal of an agreement by the United States, to which they had themselves contributed, he said. 
Europeans, he added, would do everything to protect the interests of their companies and planned to lead tight negotiations with Washington via the European Union. Trumps decision to pull out of the Iran deal has left his country diplomatically isolated.

Fuel price hike to affect prices of essentials: NFF
	
The prices of essential goods would also increase to the decision by the government to increase fuel prices, the National Freedom Front (NFF) warned.
The government on Thursday (10) announced that the prices of Petrol, Diesel and Kerosene would be increased by Rs. 20, Rs. 14 and Rs. 57 respectively with effect from midnight.
NFF Propaganda Secretary, Muhammad Muzammil said the price of essential goods would go up as result. In recent times, the "Yahapalana" government has increased the prices of goods such as rice, coconuts and gas. As a result the price of foodstuff such as tea, hoppers and even the poor man's packet of rice would go up, he said.
Although both the President and Prime Minister promised that they would not burden the people by increasing the prices of essential goods and services, the opposite has happened, Muzammil added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Malaysias king to pardon Anwar, paving way for return to politics
	

KUALA LUMPUR AFP May11, 2018- Malaysias king has agreed to pardon Anwar Ibrahim immediately, the countrys newly installed prime minister said Friday, paving the way for the jailed leader to return to politics and potentially become premier. 
It was the latest dramatic development after Mahathir Mohamads alliance inflicted a shock defeat on the long-ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, ending the corruption-riddled regimes six-decade stranglehold on power. 
Mahathir -- who had retired in 2003 as premier but made a comeback in a bid to oust the coalition he once headed --was sworn in Thursday, becoming the worlds oldest elected leader at 92. 
The elderly politician joined forces with opposition parties that opposed him while in power and agreed that if elected, he would hand over the premiership to Anwar, his former nemesis and leading member of the Peoples Justice Party.

Mothers Day, the Bottle vs the Breast
	
Tomorrow is Mothers Day and the aim is to pay tribute both to the miracle of birth and to the special woman who performed that miracle: Our mother. 
According to the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF), new analysis shows that 99 per cent of Sri Lankas children are breastfed at some point in their young lives. Babies in South Asia including Sri Lanka are more likely to be breastfed than those in any other region in the world and are breastfed for longer. 
At least 98 per cent of the children are breastfed at some point in their young lives including in Afghanistan (98%), Bhutan (99%), Nepal (99%), Sri Lanka (99%), and elsewhere in South Asia the proportion is also high at 94-97%. 
According to UNICEF, almost all mothers in Sri Lanka, deemed a middle-income country, give birth at hospitals, which promote 10 steps of the baby-friendly initiative. This is on par with the high-income country of New Zealand.
Breast milk saves lives and protects babies against deadly diseases. UNICEF recommends that children should be breastfed for two years and beyond because it provides an important source of nutrients for healthy growth and can prevent half of the deaths during a childs second year of life. Furthermore, it leads to higher performance on intelligence tests among children and adolescents, 3 IQ points on average.
Breastfeeding is the best gift a mother can give her child and herself, says Jean Gough, UNICEFs Regional Director for South Asia. As we celebrate Mothers Day, we must give mothers the support they need to start and continue breastfeeding. Breastfeeding for longer periods is important for the mothers health; for each year a mother breastfeeds, her risk of developing breast cancer falls by 6 per cent.
While Sri Lanka should be proud that almost every child is breastfed at some point in his or her life, we need to encourage mothers to breastfeed for as long as possible, ideally for two years. This brings immense benefits in the form of nutrition, health and well-being for both mother and baby, according to Tim Sutton, UNICEFs Representative in Sri Lanka.
There has been little progress in improving rates of continued breastfeeding at two years of age in South Asia between 2000 (68%) and 2016 (71%). Also, in some countries, breastfeeding rates fall by more than 20 per cent between the childs first and second birthdays. 
The recent analysis also showed that babies belonging to wealthier families are more likely to miss out on continued breastfeeding. In South Asia, 81 per cent of babies aged 20-23 months from poorer families are breastfed compared to only 57 per cent in richer families. 
This trend is seen across the world. Some 7.6 million babies are not breastfed and babies in the worlds richest countries are most likely to miss out. Figures show that an estimated 22 per cent of babies in high-income countries are never breastfed. The rate of babies not being breastfed in low-and-middle-income countries, is 4 per cent. 
UNICEF says, factors leading to higher breastfeeding rates vary. Countries like India and Vietnam have put in place strong policies to protect and promote breastfeeding. Through its global campaign, Every Child ALIVE, it demands solutions on behalf of the worlds newborns and UNICEF urges governments, the private sector and civil society to:
Increase funding and awareness to raise breastfeeding rates from birth through the age of two; Put in place strong legal measures to regulate the marketing of infant formula and other breast-milk substitutes as well as bottles and teats; Enact paid family leave and put in place workplace breastfeeding policies, including paid breastfeeding breaks; Implement the ten steps to successful breastfeeding in maternity facilities, and provide breast-milk for sick newborns; Ensure that mothers receive skilled breastfeeding counselling at health facilities and in the first week after delivery;
Strengthen links between health facilities and communities, so that mothers are ensured of continued support for breastfeeding and Improve monitoring systems to track improvements in breastfeeding policies, programmes and practices. 
We hope the Sri Lankan government will follow these steps and encourage breastfeeding for two to three years. Mothers also need to cooperate for the sake of their babies and the next generation instead of being misled by beauticians on one side and by milk powder companies on the other.

Ousted PM Razak banned from leaving Malaysia
	
Ousted Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak was banned from leaving Malaysia on Saturday, suggesting the new government under Mahathir Mohamad will move swiftly to investigate Mr Najibs links to the countrys largest-ever corruption scandal, Financial Times reported.
Dozens of protesters and journalists arrived at the small Subang airport in the capital last night after reports circulated of a passenger manifest showing that Mr Najib and his wife Rosmah were scheduled to leave Malaysia on a private jet. Mr Najib said earlier in the day that he would take a short break to spend time with my family following his shock loss in Wednesdays election.
But Malaysias immigration office said on Saturday that the pair were blacklisted from leaving the country.
I have been informed that the Immigration Department of Malaysia will not permit my family and I to go abroad. I respect the decision and will spend time with my family in the country, Mr Razak said on Twitter.
The 92-year-old Mr Mahathir, now the prime minister again, left the United Malays National Organisation, the political party he joined in 1946, after allegations emerged that Mr Najib received almost $700m linked to the controversial 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) fund.
The US Department of Justice says more than $4.5bn was misappropriated from the fund. Mr Najib denies any wrongdoing. Senior figures in the new government said late on Friday night that retrieving money from the 1MDB remained a priority for the new administration.

Permanent solution  needed for human-jumbo conflict
	

It was the majestic Dalaputtuwas killing that went viral and drew world attention, followed by the killing of Missaka and many other nameless elephants

Much land is available under the Ministries of Agriculture Development, Disaster Management, Environment and Natural Resources, Coconut and Rubber etc

Urgent changes are needed with immediate effect if the elephant population in Sri Lanka is to survive. While it has shocked the world, we in Sri Lanka look on helplessly. It was the majestic Dalaputtuwas killing that went viral and drew world attention, followed by the killing of Missaka and many other nameless elephants. With an indifferent Department of Wildlife Conservation and interfering politicians, nothing happens. There is the presence of political power behind the rampant destruction of a large elephant passage at Pallekandal which is within the Wilpattu National Park. It was repeatedly highlighted in the media that a shrine for St. Anthony is maintained against the law of the country in Pallekandal. This is atrocity and arrogance when other religions abstain from this type of act. Regardless of what faith the leaders belong to, they must abide by the law. Thousands of worshipers at St. Anthonys shrine are not aware of this situation.

There is the presence of political power behind the rampant destruction of a large elephant passage at Pallekandal

The State must step in and instruct the Director General of Wildlife to pull down the shrine with respect to the saint and close the entry that disturbs wildlife. It should apply to any other existing place of worship that has come up within this premises. Elephants die all the time when they are robbed of their environment that provides them with shelter, food and water.

Why not find alternate land for all these thousands of farmers and people who encroach and open up the area that was originally the homeland of these grazing animals

Power lines are only a temporary measure and dangerous to the lives of both humans and elephants. Maintaining these lines causes a dent in the economy. After watching this drama for many years and the toll taking on the elephant community, I can suggest a permanent solution but there mustnt be political interference. Why not find alternate land for all these thousands of farmers and people who encroach and open up the area that was originally the homeland of these grazing animals This is how it was around ten to fifteen years ago until corrupt politicians invaded the placeand started deforestation to help their allies. 

Power lines are only a temporary measure and dangerous to the lives of both humans and elephants

Much land is available under the Ministries of Agriculture Development, Disaster Management, Environment and Natural Resources, Coconut and
Rubber etc.
They can communicate among themselves and free up some land to preserve wild life.
In the wake of Wesak and Poson, the President should be focused on this compassionate issue.

The Security Council, which is deeply divided over Syria, is highly unlikely to issue a statement and no council member has asked for a meeting on the missile attacks against Israel and Syria. 
But Secretary-General Guterres urged an immediate halt to all hostile acts to avoid a new conflagration in the Middle East, a UN spokesman revealed.

## Title: US Senate mustnt allow torturer to become  CIA boss

US Senate mustnt allow torturer to become  CIA boss
	

In Charles Dickenss novel A Tale of Two Cities, set during the French revolution of 1789, he draws the character of Madame Defarge. She along with other members of the Tricoteuse, the knitting women, perch every day next to the guillotine, knitting into hats and socks the names of those to be executed, while watching the upper aristocracy and upper bourgeoisie being dispatched to their death one by one. They were regarded as respected sisters of the revolution.
I cant help being reminded of her when I read the CV of the woman nominated by President Donald Trump to be the new head of the CIA, Gina Haspel, who is due to be cross examined at a Senate hearing on May 9th. She is a career officer who ran a CIA black site in Thailand. She implemented the torture policies of President George W. Bush. She also, according to the Economist, transmitted her bosss orders to destroy video evidence of brutal interrogations.
She ignored the UN Convention Against Torture which the conservative president, Ronald Reagan, had successfully fought to be ratified. James Comey, the FBI director, another Republican, who was fired by George W. Bush, wrote in his recent memoirs, I couldnt get away from the mental pictures of naked men chained to the ceiling in a cold, blazingly lit, cell for endless days.

I cant help being reminded of her when I read the CV of the woman nominated by President Donald Trump to be the new head of the CIA, Gina Haspel, who is due to be cross examined at a Senate hearing on May 9th. She is a career officer who ran a CIA black site in Thailand. She implemented the torture policies of President George W. Bush. She also, according to the Economist, transmitted her bosss orders to destroy video evidence of brutal interrogations

When the allies captured high-ranking members of the Nazi government and German generals they wanted all the information they could get. They got most of it but they never used torture. What Bush with the connivance of Haspel and her like did would never have been allowed, yet the stakes then were much higher.
Immediately on attaining office President Barack Obama banned torture. In sharp contrast during his campaign Trump said he favoured bringing it back and a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding. Contradicting him, his Secretary of Defence, General James Mattis, says he doesnt believe in torture. He argues that he could extract from a prisoner the information needed with two chairs, a packet of cigarettes and a couple of bottles of beer.
The Mattis line follows the arguments of the 2014 report of the US Senate that examined, among others, the torture of the 9/11 mastermind, Khalid Sheikh. He was waterboarded -- which gives the sensation of drowning -- 183 times. The report concluded that the information extracted from him could have been learned without torture.
Primitive man, like other animals, followed his instincts and killed his enemy as swiftly as the job could be done. Archaeologists, examining skeletons, have found no evidence of torture.
For several hundred thousand years torture did not exist. Only in the last few thousand has it become a weapon of state.
Rome tortured the early Christians. The Christian Church repelled by this Roman practice, for a thousand years used its great strength to abolish torture. Until the time of Pope Innocent IV in the thirteenth century it was practically unknown in the Western world.
The Inquisition brought it back. Heretics were forced to undergo a very systematic use of torture, while a magistrate sat close by logging carefully the instruments used.
In the 17th century. torture began to die out. In 1640 it was abolished in England by law. After the 1789 Revolution France made the use of torture a capital offence. Most German states and Russia abolished it in the nineteenth century. Moreover, the European imperial powers did much to dampen its use in the many parts of the world where they had their empires.
During the twentieth century torture returned with a vengeance. It reached such a scale that it dwarfed even the darkest Middle Ages. It was Mussolinis fascists that were the first government to make torture an official policy. The blackshirts invented their own particular brand of torture- pumping a prisoner full of castor oil to purge him of the will to exist.
The German Nazis not only developed the concentration camps for mass extermination of the Jews, gypsies and homosexuals they regularly used torture. Spain, under Franco, used torture until the 1970s. As late as 1981 Spanish police were found to have used torture against Basque nationalists.
In the United Kingdom during the civil war in Northern Ireland torture was used in the 1960s and early 1970s mainly against the IRA. Hooding, loud, high-pitched noise, sleep and food deprivation were the main tools. It was uncovered by Irish newspapers and triggered a great row in Britain. Eventually it was banned.
In 1972 Amnesty International launched a campaign, supported by the Scandinavian countries and Holland, to abolish torture. But it took until 1984 to win a UN legally binding treaty. Bush and Trump have ignored it. So did the British government of Tony Blair.
With people like Gina Haspel in charge of the CIA we can assume the worst. The Senate must not confirm her in office.

Wont worship or apologise to politicians: SF
	
Minister and Field Marshal, Sarath Fonseka yesterday said he would never worship or apologise to any politician.
Speaking to journalists at the end of an inspection tour of the Elephant orphanage in Horowpathana, he said he had only worshiped his parents and the clergy.
The character called Sarath Fonseka had only worshiped his parents and the clergy in his life. I have never worshiped any politician and never will. When the Rajapaksa regime imprisoned me, I was told that I would be released if I apologoised. When I didnt bow down back then, people must know that I will not worship or apologised to politicians now, he said.
He said making Cabinet decisions public was a responsible duty and should not be an act of toeing any line.
In the recent past, I made some comments since I was not given the Law and Order Ministry . In some statements, some personnel were politically criticized. The reports that I worshiped and apologised to President Sirisena is a lie. We had a three-minute meeting with the President. If there were any issues, the President said we could discuss and resolve them instead of making them public. Then I replied saying I had to do that because of the atmosphere that revailed before and that we can continue to work together, he said.
