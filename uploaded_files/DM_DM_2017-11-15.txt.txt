Assistance to Sri Lanka - No strings attached: China
	
China will not attach any strings when extending financial assistance to Sri Lanka and will not use an investigation into alleged human rights violations or war crimes during the armed conflict as a precondition, Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry said yesterday.
Miss Zhang Song, who is the the Secretary of the South Asian Division of the Ministry's Department of Asian Affairs, said her country provided assistance on the sole basis of the centuries old cultural, trade and religious links between the two countries.
She said this when she met Sri Lankan journalists currently visiting China under a cultural and media exchange programme.
Miss Song said however, the development and technological assistance from China to any country was not based on politics or individuals and had no special affection for former president Mahinda Rajapaksa's regime during which billions of dollars worth of development programmes were launched in Sri Lanka. She said the Chinese government maintained close and friendly links with the current administration led by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
"We are aware of the strategic location of Sri Lanka in the Indian Ocean. That is why we offer whatever assistance possible to Sri Lanka to stand on its feet as a major partner in the South Asian region. For instance, the Colombo Port handles more than two million containers and it could be easily increased to six million," she stressed.
Miss Song said China agreed to Sri Lanka's request to renegotiate the Hambantota Port Development Project because China did not want an investment programme launched in good faith to be turned into a political issue in the beneficiary country.
She said Sri Lanka had the potential to rise as a economically powerful and strategically important country in the Asia region and China would always back Sri Lanka to achieve that target.
Miss Song reiterated China's willingness to invest in modern technological projects centered in particular on the proposed Free Trade Zone in Hambantota generating nearly 100,000 employment opportunities for Sri Lankan youth. (Sandun A Jayasekera reporting from Beijing)

At least 400 killed  and thousands injured
	

At least 400 people have been killed and more than 6,000 are injured after a 7.3 magnitude earthquake hit theIraq-Iran border.
The quake hit 19 miles southwest of Halabja in Iraqi Kurdistan at around 9.20pm on Sunday, when many people would have been at home. More than 100 aftershocks followed.
Iran gave a provisional toll of more than 400 dead, with six further deaths reported on the Iraq side of the border. Tremors were felt as far west as the Mediterranean coast.
The earthquake hit several western provinces of Iran but the hardest hit province was Kermanshah, which has announced three days of mourning. More than 236 of the victims were in Sarpol-e Zahab county in Kermanshah province, 10 miles from the Iraq border. Footage and images from the region show people fleeing their homes into the night and others grieving the deaths of their loved ones. Residents as far away as Baghdad, 200 miles from the epicentre, said the quake was so powerful, buildings were dancing in the air. Irans emergency services chief Pir Hossein Koolivand said it was difficult to send rescue teams to the villages because the roads have been cut off... there have been landslides.
The official IRNA news agency said 30 Red Cross teams had been sent to the quake zone, parts of which had experienced power cuts.

The Green party leader had recently given a severe dressing-down to a purohita holding a high post in the party.

This is a sequel to a number of complaints made to the Green leader that a relative of the purohita has become a meddling nuisance to the white collar high-ups in the Ministry.
This relative fellow who visits the Ministry whenever the purohita is away is said to be issuing various orders to the white-collar high-ups which are mostly illegal.
When the white collar ones found the situation intolerable, they complained about it to the Green leader, they say

A news-piece that went viral recently said Number One and Number Two held a one-on-one, four-hour deliberation behind closed doors in an evening a few days ago at the formers official residence and the views they exchanged on several serious issues generated much heat leading to a fiery verbal duel.

Two days after the reported meeting of the Big Two, the former strongman had met Rugger Wikrama the purohita of the Green party at a rugger match and while engrossed in small talk, the former strongman had asked the purohita whether it was true that his party boss had a right royal row with the yahapalanaya boss the other day.
The query had ruffled the purohita so much he had immediately looked around as if to search someone and then blurted out: Theres no truth in that story!
After giving this reply, the purohita had left the place in a hurry as if to avoid any further discourse on the matter, they say.

Forestry in a new landscape
	
The world has been experiencing Mother Natures fury in full force through earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, landslides etc. Sri Lankas experiences havent been any different. The drastic and irregular climate changes are seen as an adverse consequence of deforestation. At present awareness and concern regarding forest protection and environmental conservation is rising. The 27th session of the Asia-Pacific Forestry Commission was hosted in Sri Lanka this year. It was conducted from October 23 to 27 at the BMICH, in Colombo, with the participation of President Maithripala Sirisena as the Chief Guest. About 300 local and international representatives participated at the event. There were representatives from 33 Asian region countries, including Sri Lanka. During the session, which was held under the theme Forestry in a new landscape many discussions were initiated under topics such as guidelines for forest management, methods for regional forest and landscape establishments, existence of greenery in urban landscapes, contribution of forests for food and nutrition security, new ways for community forest management and estimating the forest resources in 2020. 
This commission is established under the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the UN and is held biannually. 
Sri Lanka hosted 27th session ofAsia-Pacific Forestry Commission
We have a target to increase forest coverage in the island from 29.7% to 32%
-S.A. Anura Satharasinghe, Conservator General of Forests, Sri Lanka
After the signing of the Paris Convention, Sri Lanka is taking steps to achieve greener development and a greener economy under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena. We have a target to increase forest coverage in the island from 29.7% to 32%. As a developing country, we have numerous development targets to reach as well. When planning our tactics to reach the targets, conserving forests is a challenge. Our intention of increasing forest coverage to 32% has to be kept in mind when our tactics to reach our targets and move forward as a nation are considered, the Conservator General said. Special features of the summit were the new ways and methods that were discussed for forest rehabilitation in the Asian Region. On a final note, he stressed that forest preservation should be encouraged.
Recognition of forest sector is particularly important,
- Assistant Director General of the Forest Department, Food and Agriculture Organisation of the UN- Hiroto Mitsuki
Hiroto Mitsuki opined that major changes have to be made using many dimensions where the forest sectors operate. He explained that forests were essential in mitigating the impact of natural disasters such as cyclonic storms, droughts, floods and landslides. 
Trees and forests play an important role in enhancing the resilience of the communities, but we need to evolve and be energetic to grasp these opportunities. Recognition of the forest sector is important. It highlights a broad contribution specifically on forests and exemplifies a broad new landscape. I want to assure that FAO is certainly ready to work alongside all countries and stakeholdersto optimize forestry,
assured Mitsuki. 
Forest aspects are long term and need to be treated strategically,
-Director General of the World Agro Forestry Centre  Tony Simmons
Tony Simmons addressed issues that arise in pursuit of creating new forestry landscapes. He conveyed 14 key messages to be recalled when solving these issues. Trees have made our planet habitable for humans, mammals and other forms of life and it will be the destruction of trees that will lead to our destruction as well. These forests arent just biophysical domains of trees. They have people living within. We have got to pay as much attention to the people as much as we do to the bio physical tree landscape, he explained.
Forest aspects are long term and need to be treated strategically. Now of course it is agriculture that has created much of the destruction to the forests in the world. Reducing deforestation and degradation are worthy ventures, he added. 
Simmons stressed that it is essential to pay attention to forest quality as much as to forest quantity. Loss of nutrients occurs when trees are felled. 69% of carbon is lost due to degradation. Land degradation leads to loss of soil. It takes about 100 years to build up 2cm of topsoil. Land restoration is essential, he underscored.
He expressed his delight over working with various ministries and authorities in Sri Lanka to set up the workshop in keeping with the theme Land health is national wealth. It was stated that the FAO will be holding an international conference in February next year to address the issue of deforestation and how to increase forest area.
The environment has become a challenge to every living being
-President Maithripala Sirisena
President Maithripala Sirisena commented on the growing attention on forest conservation locally as well as internationally. Forest preservation, forest density, forest destruction, protection of natural resources, the value of natural resources are some of the topics that have received huge attention. 
We were one of the first countries to sign the Paris Agreement in 2016, to take action in the preservation of the environment. As an initiative effort of the Blue Green Era, programmes have started to enrich the country with trees, leaves and increase forests and to encourage forest preservation. Vanaropana National Tree Planting programme is one such programme that has been conducted islandwide. This aims to protect the forests in our country borrowing support from the triforces and police. The forestry conservation department also provides its support to carry on the activities of forest protection, said the president.
By not protecting forests and the rapid decrease of forest density, the environment cant prevail. The main point of environmental conservation focuses on the simplest ways in which each and every citizen in the country will be able to protect forests. Today, we can witness the climatic and weather changes like never before. The environment has become a challenge to every living being. In Sri Lanka, the Government is providing food for families, numbering about 8 lakhs, due to the drought, which lasted for 3 months. Other countries in the Asian pacific regions are also experiencing adverse effects due to weather too, the president pointed out. He concluded by explaining how important the preservation of the environment is to minimize natural disasters. 
The target is to increase forest coverage from29.7%to32%.
The event concluded with Thomas Hopper, Senior Forestry Officer and APFC Secretary, Food and Agriculture Organization, UN, delivering the vote of thanks.

The government is making sinister attempts to delay the local government elections by getting one of its own party members to challenge in Court the gazette notification on the elections, joint opposition MP Ranjith Soysa said today.
"It does not make any difference to the JO because it is prepared to face the elections any time," he told a media briefing held at the parliamentary complex.
He said the JO would form a broad alliance consisting of anti-government parties and civil society groups to contest the LG elections.
"The JO is willing to join any party other than the UNP. We will announce the name and symbol of this new alliance shortly," the MP said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Joint Opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa said today the government had obtained Rs. 4.7 trillion as loans for three years whereas only Rs. 5.2 trillion was obtained as loans for nine years during the previous regime.
Speaking during the budget debate, he said the debt burden had gone up by 64% since the government came to power.
"The debt to GDP ratio was 77.6 per cent in 2014 when the present government came to power. But it was increased to 79.3 per cent in 2016 without the war and constructive development programmes," he said.
MP Weerawansa said the government was planning to obtain Rs. 1,895 billion in 2018 as new loans.
He said the recurrent expenditure of the government had increased by 62 per cent when compared to the budget in 2014 where the recurrent expenditure was Rs. 868 billion.
"If the government claim that the debt burden should be borne by everyone, recurrent expenditure of the President, Prime Minister and the government should have been reduced," he said.
Mr. Weerawansa said the government had no plans to implement the 'Blue, Green' budget which would be only a set of words.
He said the budget included a set of proposals which would not be able to implement in practice adding that it had intended for the foreigners than the local entrepreneurs. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

He has decided to quit at long last
	

Diyawanna members would meet in the lobby to have a friendly chat or to have a laugh over some tit-bits floating around whenever they get a break from their days work. There are times when some of them come out with even top state secrets by way of amusing anecdotes at these gossip sessions.

A group of backbenchers who met in the lobby the other day were discussing the endless squabbling between some Greens and Blues in yahapalanaya when one of them brought up the latest news about a senior Blue party purohita hailing from an oft-flood-hit region in the country.
This senior Blue purohita is said to be much down-hearted these days due to all his persistent efforts to re-unite the two factions having gone down the drain. He had been pursuing this goal undeterred despite constant nagging by his better half to quit yahapalanaya and throw in his lot with the former big boss.
The latest news is that this senior purohita has now decided to make the move that he had been postponing for a long time; to quit yahapalanaya and had already conveyed the happy tidings to his better half!
He has timed the exit to coincide it with the announcement of the day for the local polls, yes, of course, to trigger a pro-JO opinion wave. One or two colleagues of his too will follow suit making a dramatic effect on the political scene!

JO stalwart Panchaudha of Fast-unto-death fame had a surprise the other day when he got a telephone call from the purohita who was at the centre of the recent oil fiasco.

Panchaudhas surprise transformed into exultation when the purohita said that he called him to thank him!
I wanted to thank you because you are the only opposition member who explained to the country the real complexion of the oil crisis we had to face!
The purohita proceeded to confide in Panchaudha. He told him as to who unsuccessfully pressured him to call back the oil tanker carrying the sub-standard oil shipment which he turned back.
Panchaudha is expected to divulge shortly the parties who pressured the purohita to have the substandard oil unloaded for distribution in our country, they say.
Meanwhile, Panchaudhas party sources say that at least two Betel leaf purohitas are involved in the alleged political pressure scandal.

During the recent oil crisis, the people in long queues at filling stations hurling abuse at the government and name-calling the bigwigs in yahapalanaya was a commonplace occurrence.

A group of senior purohitas apprised Number One of this development adding that the situation could take a turn for the worse if the crisis was not resolved without further delay. They also complained that the purohita handling the subject and several other purohitas for that matter were responsible for exacerbating the issue.
Number One soon afterwards sent for the purohita handling the oil subject and gave him a shelling for holding him responsible for the situation. He also warned the purohita of severe action against him if he failed to resolve the crisis forthwith, they say.

It is the whole elephant that is sick, not just its trunk How the insanity of specialisation turned
	
These days, when I go to a doctor, I feel like the elephant that was analysed by five blind men. I get shunted from the trunk-lady to the foot-dude who consults the tail-gal who speaks to the ear-guy who phones up the mahout.
Each selectively tests everything from my teeth enamel to my toe nails. Each gives me five different types of medication specific to each persons specialisation.
They attack my wallet to the tune of fifty thousand rupees and turn me into a chronic, serial pill popper. Almost, I want to tap them on their shoulders and whisper people, it is the whole darn elephant that is sick, not the elephants trunk. That is only diseased. Curing that will only cure the disease not the sickness. I know it wont do any good though. Specialization has blinded these people and telling them they are blind wont give them back their sight. Nor will it give sight to those who equally blindly believe in these sightless scientific surgeons when they poke and prod at people, ideas and things, hitting a few, missing a lot and mostly destroying the things on which their intellectual scalpels land.
Ive written about this many times in many ways but this line of thinking started some fifteen years ago because of a casual statement made by an American busker (and biochemist) named Stewart on the banks of the Huron river at the University of Michigan.
My guitar and his harmonica were talking to each other under a bower of maple, linden and aspen blazing their autumn shades off caramelized leaves.
On one of the breaks from the music he waved his hand to take in the red-gold forest and casually said AJ, did you know that most trees are standing on their heads and Im like huh.
He shrugged. Think about it, most of them absorb nutrients through their roots and excrete oxygen and water vapour through stomata in their leaves. hmm! That was a new one for me although Stus observation is as old as the hills.
Ive never thought of them that way before I said as I put my guitar down. As I pondered what he said, something triggered, something kindled, something became. mmm so too is the tree of knowledge. Hes like huh
Think about it I said.
The source energy of the knowledge tree comes from the roots. Not the trunk, large branches, sub-branches, twigs, leaves or fruit. Those are the outcomes of processing root nutrients not the source of the nutriment itself. We cannot truly know anything by going up that tree. We must climb down from its sub-branches to bigger branches to large branches to massive branches to trunk to root. Each lower level providing baser, greater, wider levels of understanding as to why the entire tree from root to fruit exists.
Stu had this habit of rapidly popping his lips when he is thinking of something and he popped away for a long time, his double barrelled harmonica forgotten before he said (paraphrased)
So a huge branch would be the physical sciences, a big branch would be chemistry, a smaller one would be biochemistry, a twig would be Lipids, a leaf would be cholesterol and a fruit would be the finding that cholesterol is bad. So if a biochemist says cholesterol is bad, that finding is the excrement of some fundamental food intake of a form and source that chemistry knows nothing about.
I nodded vigorously. And, heres the thing. You will have to drill down below chemistry to figure out if your conclusion about cholesterol is good shit or not. You have to know the reason why the massive branch of the physical sciences exists in the first place since chemistry is merely a sub-branch. That will give you a minor paradigm shift like the crossover from Newtonian to Quantum mechanics. But that is not enough. One level lower you land on the trunk which is a large paradigm shift such as those being proposed by the meta-physicists and noetic scientists. That wont cut it either. You will have to mosey down to the root like the wise and the spiritualists do.
If you break a car into its component parts, you can understand exactly how it works and if you put it back together it will come back alive. Here is the fallacy: If you do that to a dog, once it is put back together it will remain dead
Those feed off a plethora of nutrients that enable them to reflect, assimilate, consolidate, reject, interact, intermesh and direct their ever growing insight and understanding of wholes within wholes. Only then can one stabilize knowledge and obtain key clues as to how the food and why the waste.
I pulled out a piece of paper from my backpack and hastily sketched the figure that I have recreated here. He studied it, engaging in some very serious lip-popping.
You just now cooked this up
Well yeah, because of what you said, but its pretty obvious and I am sure there are others whove come to the same conclusion before me Stu.
He shook his head. No. This is simpler. Damn it man, following your reasoning, all that we have been doing for a long time is showering the world with shit. AJ Thats some serious shit you are claiming and the thing is  it makes sense. We are no longer seekers, we are just excrement manufacturers.
Soon after, I returned to Sri Lanka and Stuwell I dunno. But folks, if all that French was confusing, let me try to explain this a bit more.
For 400 years, we have refused to believe that understanding exists at the root of the knowledge tree and conveniently messed around with twigs, leaves and fruits trying to stand it on its head.
Valiantly, we have attempted to legitimize the case for calling its excretory organ its intake organ. Responding exclusively to symptoms and surface observations, we have tried to re-label its backside as its mouth.
A view that believes that everything can be broken down into their component pieces, studied in mutually disassociated states, deductively or inferentially linked together through analysis and understood as a whole.
Here is the general rationale: If you break a car into its component parts, you can understand exactly how it works and if you put it back together it will come back alive. Here is the fallacy: If you do that to a dog, once it is put back together it will remain dead.
Something very essential to the idea of the living dog, the whole of its existence is lost in the process of dismembering it. Similarly, when attempting to understand systems that exist dependent on an infinity of parameters (living beings, ecosystems, social groups, nations etc.), breaking them down has only one practical outcome  it breaks them.
But we are never taught that. Instead, we are told that we must break things into sectors and pieces to know what is going on in the cosmos despite the fact that the cosmos is neither made that way nor exists that way nor functions that way.
And so, weve landed ourselves with hundreds of specializations and thousands of minor ones, each basically a fact-bucket. Inside them lives that very strange animal  the specialist or, the fact-sop - answering a series of (mostly) irrelevant questions that yields a lot of nothings about mostly everything.
What has this type of science done for us Have we understood the world clearer or made it better No. Do we need fact-sops like climate specialists, agriculture experts, energy gurus, military strategists or money moguls to tell us that No! Can we solve it Sure.
Instead of scrambling up into the branches and twigs of the tree of knowledge, we need to scurry down to its root.

JO trying to delay polls: UNP
	
The United National Party (UNP) today pointed the finger at the Joint Opposition (JO) for attempting to delay the polls for Local Government bodies by filing a case in courts.
UNP Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera told a news conference that all the groundwork had been made to hold polls by the end of January next year.
Against this backdrop, the accomplice of the JO had gone to courts to get the election delayed. When there is no election in the horizon, they want elections. When the elections are announced, they go into hiding. As cowards, they had gone to courts now to get a restraining order, he said.
He said the UNP was ready to face the elections and expressed optimism that people would give a fair mandate after considering the projects implemented by the government and policies introduced by it.
I challenge the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the JO to come forward, face the people and to accept the peoples mandate. There are criticisms about us but the criticisms over the JO still outnumber them. People have not forgotten they way they handled the projects in the past and how they behaved, he said.

Naseby statement will clear Sri Lankan security forces
	
The statement made by Lord Naseby during the sessions of Britains House of Lords will help Sri Lanka to safeguard the dignity of its security forces to some extent, State Minister of Foreign Affairs Wasantha Senanayake told Parliament yesterday.
The State Minister made this remark in response to an allegation made by Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardene that the government is ignoring this statement and is not making any effort to make use of this statement to create a favourable situation for the Sri Lankan security forces.
All parties should get together and thank Lord Naseby for backing Sri Lanka, the Deputy Minister said while suggesting that all parties should get together and thank Lord Naseby. He said he had already sent a letter to him thanking him for the initiative he had taken on behalf of Sri Lanka. He said the information which Lord Naseby came out with makes it clear that Sri Lankan security forces have engaged in the war in a legitimate manner.
Sri Lanka has got an opportunity which it should not miss. We all should write a letter thanking Lord Naseby for taking an initiative to Help Sri Lankan security forces clear their names of the crimes they never committed, he added
Mr Gunawardene who moved an adjournment motion on the issue said the following:
Since Lord Naseby, addressing Britains House of Lords, drew attention to the fact that the casualty figures for the last period of the civil conflict in Sri Lanka, which ended in May 2009, cited in the United Nations Darusman Report, were brought into question by the figures quoted by former UN spokesman Gordon Weiss, by former US Ambassador Blake, in the report by the UKs Major General Holmes, and finally, by the heavily-redacted communications from the UKs Lieutenant Colonel Anton Gash released to him by the British Government; and since he further stated that UK must recognize that this was a war against terrorism, so the rules of engagement are based on international humanitarian law, not the European Convention on Human Rights and that the West, and in particular the US and UK, must remove the threat of war crimes and foreign judges that overhangs and overshadows all Sri Lankans, especially their leaders, the Government should take action to pursue this matter with Britains Foreign and Commonwealth Office and with the UN Human Rights Commission to change their unjust positions in regard to Sri Lanka.

No intention to promote beer: UNP
	
The budget proposal to remove excise duty on canned beer was not taken with the intention to promote beer in the country, the United National Party (UNP) said today.
It said the proposal envisages to put in place a formula to introduce taxes on alcoholic beverages based on their alcohol volume, which is the international standard.
The government previously increased the prices of alcohol. This time, the government had introduced a formula to streamline taxes on alcoholic beverages. Illicit alcoholic beverages such as moonshine cause serious health complications. Even the Health Minister had admitted to spending large amount of money for the treatment of people with such complications, UNP Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera told a news briefing.
He said the debate on alcohol-whether it is good or bad-was not anew but he wont back alcohol as someone who doesnt consume them.
However, I respect others choices, he said. From the Budget 2018, the Finance Minister proposed to introduce an alcohol volume based Excise Duty depending on the type of liquor for hard liquor, beer and wine. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

A teacher of a grade eight class of a school in the North Western Province was teaching the students the use of opposite phrases.
After explaining to the students the composition of the opposite words, she had instructed them to write five words with opposite meanings. One of the students had written Up, Down, Sky and Earth and Mother and Father. The teacher lost no time in explaining that the words Mother and Father are not opposite words but opposite genders and not to write nouns in their answers.
The student concerned replied to the teacher that the words Mother and Father are truly opposite words as for everything they keep on arguing and fighting, and this morning too it had happened. The entire class roared with laughter.
The teacher broke this news to another teacher during the recess and her reply was ,"the student may be correct and you are wrong". All were amused by this reply.(Upasena Liyanagama)

Petrol crisis resulted from failure to maintain buffer stock
	
The Cabinet sub-committee appointed to look into the recent petrol crisis, has found that the failure to maintain buffer stocks and the absence of a mechanism to carry out emergency supplies was what resulted in the shortage.
The committee, headed by the Minister Sarath Amunugama, handed over the report to President Maithripala Sirisena at yesterday's Cabinet meeting.
The committee which was given more time to carry out further investigations on the matter, raised doubts as to how the delay in the arrival of the two shipments -- one ordered by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and the other by the Lanka Indian Oil Company (LIOC) -- arriving in Sri Lanka and the breakdown of the refinery happening simultaneously.
It takes 21 days to import a shipment of fuel after placing an order and in a worst case scenario, 62,000 to 65,000 tonnes of petrol should have been in storage during this period.
Based on the committee report Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga had directed the CID to conduct an inquiry into this matter. (Kelum Bandara)

SC awards compensation to British tourist with Buddha tattoo
	
The Supreme Court today awarded a total of Rs.800,000 -- Rs.600,000 as compensation and Rs.200,000 as cost--to Britisher Naomi Coleman who was arrested and deported for having a Buddha tattoo on her right upper arm.
The Supreme Court said her fundamental rights had been breached and that a Magistrate could not issue a deportation order on the basis that a deportation order against a foreigner must only be made by the Subject Minister.
The Judgement was delivered after more than a dozen postponements because the Supreme Court bench not being constituted. The case was argued and concluded and order reserved for Judgement on June 10, 2015 after which Justice Chandra Ekanayake retired. Thereafter the case had to be re-argued.
Justice Anil Gooneratne with Justices Eva Wanasundera and Nalin Perera agreeing awarded the petitioner Naomi Michelle Coleman Rs.500,000 as compensation payable by the State and Rs.50,000 each by Police Sergeant Upasena and Katunayake Police Acting OIC Inspector Suraweera. Court also awarded Rs.200,000 as costs payable by the State.
The SC held that her fundamental right to freedom from torture, right to equality and freedom from arbitrary arrest had been infringed upon.
It said the police had misrepresented facts and misled the magistrate into believing the submissions that had been made and that a deportation order could be made by that Court.
The SC ruled that the Magistrate had no jurisdiction to make a deportation order on the basis that the deportation of foreigners is governed by the Immigration and Emigration Act and that the power to order the deportation of a foreigner is vested in the subject minister.
Petitioner Naomi Michelle Coleman, a nurse employed at the Hawkesbury Lodge, Rehabilitation Mental Health Services, cited the Attorney General, Police Sergeant Upasena, Inspector Suraweera of the Katunayake Police Station, the Negombo Prisons OIC, IGP and the then Immigration and Emigration Controller General Chulananda De Silva as respondents and sought the Court to award her Rs.10 million as compensation.
Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Jayasuriya with Deputy Solicitor General Parintha Ranasinghe and Senior State Counsel Warunika Hettige appeared for the AG.
Counsel J.C.Weliamuna PC with Pulasthi Hewamanna, Tishya Weragoda instructed by Vishwa De Livera Tennakoon appeared for Ms. Coleman.
She said as a practicing Buddhist she attends meditation retreats in Nepal, Thailand, Cambodia and India and as an apt tribute to and as a personal expression of her devotion to Buddhist teachings had on her right upper arm displayed a tattoo of the Buddha seated on a lotus flower.
She said she arrived at the Bandaranaike International Airport and when she was at the exit gate attempting to locate the luggage counter, she was approached by a taxi-cab driver later identified as Kelum Chaminda and a bystander who said the tattoo might be objectionable in Sri Lanka.
She said they took her to Katunayake Police Station where the Acting OIC confiscated her passport produced in Court without disclosing the charge against her or the offence committed and was not afforded an opportunity to communicate with the British High Commission or whether the High Commission was informed of her arrest.
She said she was introduced to an Attorney by a prison guard and had no opportunity to give instructions to the Attorney but was required to pay a fee of Rs.5,000.
She said the prison guard who was in charge, while at court, made several lewd, obscene and disparaging remarks of a sexually nature while being detained behind bars in the court room and at the conclusion of her case, her attorney informed her that she would be deported, regardless of her entreaties and would be permitted to leave to Maldives and till then detained at a deportation centre.
The petitioner said a woman prison guard had asked her to give her Rs.10,000 and attempted to take her mobile phone.
She said she was subjected to a full body search by a female officer and that an inmate provided her a mat to sleep for the night with 60 females inmates sharing the room. (S.S.Selvanayagam)

## Title: Sessions mulling second Special Counsel

Sessions mulling second Special Counsel
	

By  Matt Zapotosky 
(c) 2017, The Washington Post Nov 14, 2017 - 
WASHINGTON - Attorney General Jeff Sessions is entertaining the idea of appointing a second special counsel to investigate a host of Republican concerns - including alleged wrongdoing by the Clinton Foundation and the controversial sale of a uranium company to Russia - and has directed senior federal prosecutors to explore at least some of the matters and report back to him and his top deputy, according to a letter obtained by The Washington Post. 
The revelation came in a response from the Justice Department to an inquiry from House Judiciary Committee Chairman Robert Goodlatte, R-Va., who in July and again in September called for Sessions to appoint a second special counsel to investigate concerns he had related to the 2016 election and its aftermath. 
The list of matters he wanted probed was wide ranging, but included the FBIs handling of the investigation into Hillary Clintons use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, various dealings of the Clinton Foundation and several matters connected to the purchase of the Canadian mining company Uranium One by Russias nuclear energy agency. Goodlatte took particular aim at former FBI Director James Comey, asking for a second special counsel to evaluate the leaks he directed about his conversations with President Donald Trump, among other things. 
In response, Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd wrote that Sessions had directed senior federal prosecutors to evaluate certain issues raised in your letters, and those prosecutors would report directly to the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General, as appropriate, and will make recommendations as to whether any matters not currently under investigation should be opened, whether any matters currently under investigation require further resources, or whether any matters merit the appointment of a Special Counsel. 
Trump has repeatedly criticized his Justice Department for not aggressively probing a variety of conservative concerns. He said recently that officials there should be looking at the Democrats and that it was very discouraging they were not going after Hillary Clinton. 
Hopefully they are doing something and at some point, maybe we are going to all have it out, Trump said. 
Sessions relationship with the president has been significantly strained since he recused himself from the investigation into possible coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin to influence the 2016 election. The president has publicly lambasted his attorney general and noted, had he known in advance of Sessions recusal, he would not have appointed him to the post. It was after Sessions recusal that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller to lead the investigation into the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. 
While the Justice Department is part of the executive branch - and the attorney general is appointed by and answers to the president - the White House generally provides input on broad policy goals and does not weigh in on criminal probes. 
In that context, the letter is likely to be seen by some, especially on the left, as Sessions inappropriately bending to political pressure, possibly to save his job. Sessions, who was a Republican senator for Alabama before he was appointed attorney general, is also set to testify before Goodlattes committee on Tuesday and was likely to face questions on the topics raised in the letter. 
A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment for this article, as did a lawyer for Comey. Brian Fallon, who served as the press secretary for the Clinton campaign, noted that the Justice Department letter became public not long after it was revealed Donald Trump Jr. had communicated with WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign. 
Like clockwork, just as we learn of damning details of Donald Trump Jrs contacts with WikiLeaks, the Trump administration is firing up the fog machine to distract from the Mueller probe, Fallon said. 
In asking for a second special counsel in July, Goodlatte wrote that he wanted to request assistance in restoring public confidence in our nations justice system and its investigators. His letter, signed by 19 other Republicans, said that Judiciary Committee members were concerned that Mueller might not have a broad enough mandate to investigate other election-related matters, which he said included actions taken by Comey, Clinton and Attorney General Loretta Lynch.
Many of the items Goodlatte wanted probed had long been conservative talking points, some having to do with matters many considered long resolved: various decisions made in the Clinton email case, the Uranium One purchase, the so-called unmasking of people by the intelligence committee, and allegations, which officials have said were untrue, by Trump that he was wiretapped by his predecessors. 
In the Justice Departments response, Boyd did not indicate which of the topics might draw greater interest than others, though he said the review by senior federal prosecutors would better enable the Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General to more effectively evaluate and manage the caseload. He noted the Justice Department Inspector General already was investigating several aspects of the Clinton email case and said once that probe was complete the department would assess what, if any, additional steps are necessary to address any issues identified by that review. 
We will conduct this evaluation according to the highest standards of justice, he wrote.

Sevangala Sugar factory will not hand over to Gamage
	
Sevangala Sugar factory will not be handed back to Daya Gamage and Company despite the government's decision to repeal the 'Under performing and Under Utilized Enterprises Bill', a Cabinet minister told Parliament today.
Minister of Irrigation Wijith Wijeyamuni De Soysa came up with this statement in response to a question raised by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake in the House last morning.
"I have discussed this matter with the Finance Minister and he assured me that Sevanagala factory will not be handed back to the private sector even if the government repeals 'Under performing and Under utilized Enterprises Bill' the minister said.
However, the Minister said it is not possible to increase the sugar production and fulfil the aspirations of sugar cane farmers given the present status of Sevanagala factory. There he said the factory badly needs a refurbishment.
Earlier Mr Dissanayake said some 30,000 sugar cane farmers in Hingurana, Pellawatte and Sevanagala are facing a crisis as they are not getting fair price for their produce.
He said farmers are also hit by the closure of Hingurana factory which was privatized in 1993. The MP said the owner of this factory had fled the country after defaulting bank loans. Mr Dissanayake urged the government to increase the price of sugar cane to Rs 8,500 per tonne for the sake of the farmers.
Minister De Soysa assured that the government would do it's utmost for the sugar cane farmers. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Some bankrupt politicians slinging mud at me: Susil
	
Minister Susil Premajayantha today charged that some bankrupt politicians have engaged in slinging mud at him after he spoke during the debate on the Constitution on November 1, 2017.
Minister Premajayantha who was speaking at the second reading debate on the budget, said the allegation made by an MP that he was involved in bringing down inferior quality fuel was false. "The stock was brought down to the country when I was abroad. This was brought down by Secretary ministry of petroleum resources when I was out of the country. The company which supplied the fuel had paid compensation to the vehicle owners. The Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) later confirmed that there had been no losses incurred as compensation was paid. " he said.
" These politicians also sling mud at the President and the Maha Nayaka Theras in the same way. Only bankrupt politicians engaged in such activities", he said.
Responding to MP Thushara Indunil who raised a point of order, the minister said he was making the statement after discussing matters with both President and the Prime Minister. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Sri Lanka  An island plagued by drowning  incidents
	
Death is inevitable in our lives. Although it is so, certain incidents that occur in our lives can be avoided if we are mindful. If we analyze the causes of a number of deaths reported daily, the root cause for them is negligence. A large number of deaths reported in Sri Lanka relates to aquatic related activities. Drowning is a significant cause of death worldwide. Even WHO highlighted drowning as a major cause of death in the Global Report on Drowning (2014). People spend their leisure hours in an atmosphere which is surrounded by water. But they hardly give thought to the tragedies that water can bring to the lives of people. 
At times the sea looks so calm that it seems fascinating, but at times it is so
rough and threatens to bring death to a few lives. Thus, it is indeed essential to be vigilant when
h
anging around the sea, rivers, lakes and canals. The latest tragedy in water was reported from Thelgam
u Oya, Laggala, Matale where eight people, including children from two families, were drowned. 
Extract fromthe inaugural Drowning prevention Report for Sri Lanka Published in December 2014
Police Media Spokesperson ASP Ruwan Gunasekara told the Daily Mirror that 373 deaths had been reported between January to June (2017). According to him 877 deaths had been reported in 2016.
700 Males aged between 19-25 formed the highest number of deaths through drowning while only 177 females died due to water related incidents in 2016. Out of the death total in 2017, 299 deaths were of males while 74 were females, ASP Gunasekara said.
There have been a series of water related accidents that have been reported on. One that came under the spotlight is the tragedy where eight deaths, two being families, was reported in the Thelgamu Oya, Laggala, Matale. 
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, the President of the Life Saving Association of Sri Lanka Asanka Nanayakkara told that on average, 900 people drowned in Sri Lanka each year adding that there was a drowning rate of 4.5 deaths per 100,000 persons. 
Sri Lanka has one of the highest drowning rates globally and is placed 12th among 61 countries where death figures are high through drowning. Sri Lanka is placed 10th highest among 35 low and middle-income countries (LMIC) where death figures are high through drowning. 
Nanayakkara said that the Drowning Prevention Report is compiled by the Life Saving Association of Sri Lanka and Life Saving Victoria with the support of the World Health Organization.This is the first report to study the extent of the drowning problem in Sri Lanka. 
According to the Drowning Prevention Report, males are at higher risk of drowning compared to females. Sri Lanka has a higher drowning rate across all age groups compared to the average drowning rate in both LMIC and high-income countries (HIC). Lakes were reported as the key location for drowning incidents in Sri Lanka, Nanayakkara said.
Sri Lanka being an island surrounded by water and with a large number of waterways, rivers, waterholes, lakes and tanks suggests its citizens must possess the ability to swim or acquire basic life saving skills, the head of the Life Saving Association affirmed. 
Nanayakkara stated that the associations strategy is to make drowning prevention activities more widespread starting from the school level. He added that his association was working in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, Social Service, Health Disaster Management, Defense, Education, Sports & Tourism, International Life Saving Federation and Commonwealth Royal Life Saving UK to address the issue of drowning in Sri Lanka.
Adults aged between 25-44 most vulnerable
Adults aged between 25-44 years formed the group where the highest number of drowning deaths were recorded. The group where the deaths through drowning were recorded as the second highest included those aged between 45-64 years. However, those aged over 65 years had the highest age-specific drowning rate (8.25 deaths per 100,000), followed by those falling between the ages 45-64 years (5.38 deaths per 100,000). The drowning rate was low in the 5-14-year age group (1.94 deaths per 100,000). The male to female rate ratio was high among those belonging to the age group 15-24 years (7.5) which is closely followed by those aged between 25-44 years (7.0). The ratio was close to 1 in those aged between 0-4 years (1.8) and over 65 years of age or older (1.9). (References were made from the Drowning Prevention Report 2014)

Armed forces personnel deployed as lifeguards
Lifesaving services are being carried out across the island. A lifesaving service comprises trained lifeguards who are on duty with rescue and First Aid equipment. Lifesaving services are a key solution to address deaths through drowning in open water environments such as beaches, rivers, lakes and reservoirs/tanks. There are 51 lifesaving service locations in Sri Lanka with a total of 1,400 qualified lifeguards performing duties. Over 400 rescues are reported annually by lifeguards. This amounts to 400 lives saved, he said. 
The Drowning Prevention Report states that since the end of the civil war in Sri Lanka, in 2009, many personnel from the armed forces have been deployed as lifeguards in Sri Lanka. This has helped boost the safety of local communities and tourists alike. From a tourism perspective, lifesaving services help better utilize natural waterways in Sri Lanka and offer an untapped opportunity for promoting the country. 

Drowning is preventable and the key areas to focus on are recommended in the report as follows: 
Target school-age children and adults aged between 25 to 44. 
	Develop nationally recognized learn to swim programme guidelines for swim schools and swim teachers. 
	Incorporate minimum water safety and rescue skills into learn to swim programmes. 
	Incorporate student-instructor ratios, appropriate for the skill level and water conditions.
	Increase access to learn to swim programmes for children in low socioeconomic families.

In conclusion, it should be noted that tragic incidents related to aquatic activities can be prevented if only we become a little more conscious of the phenomena around those areas. Otherwise, valuable lives get vanished from the earth in vain. As the experts said, the fundamental ground for these tragedies is negligence. Therefore, we have to think of this issue seriously so that these types of unfortunate incidents would not take place in the long run.

The glorious  Mr.Railway Remembering Rampala
	
The single day journey from Matara to Badulla, the many expresses, and signalling system were among the few that stand to his credit

It is he who came up with the nomenclature of express services as Ruhunu Kumari, Udarata Menike, Yal Devi, Uttara Devi, Udaya Devi, Mutu Kumari, Samudra Devi, and Podi Menike
The name of the Ceylon Government Railways (CGR) and the name of former GMR B.D. Rampala are interwoven and the people who talk about the glorious days of the GCR still remember him as an unmatched personality.
He has gone down in the annals of history of the Railways Department as a towering figure. With his rugged personality, he commanded high recognition in the public service and his name is indelible in the history of the Railways Department. His 107th Birthday fell yesterday November 14.
Born at Rukmale in Pannipitiya on November 14, 1910 as the eldest in the family of a government school teacher, he had his secondary education at the Ananda and Nalanda Colleges before he entered the Colombo University College and graduated as an engineer.
Dr. N.M. Perera who founded the Lanka Sama Samaja Party and one time Minister of Finance was among his colleagues in Ananda College.
Large stocks of old rails piled on either side of railway line, railway compartments, and goods-wagons left to decay in railway yards today would have been a taboo during his time
After passing out as an engineer, Mr. Rampala joined the Mechanical Department of the CGR at Ratmalana in 1934 and after a successful career as a brilliant engineer, he was destined to be the successor to the first Sri Lankan GMR Mr. Kanagasabai who retired.
Mr. Rampala who came to the helm of the railway administration as General Manager introduced a series of revolutionising measures in keeping with the need of the passenger public and to meet the increasing demand for train service as the most popular public transport service.

The single day journey from Matara to Badulla was one of his revolutionary measures that stand to his credit.
The passengers travelling by train from Matara to Badulla had to break journey in Colombo and take the night mail train or the Badulla Express the following morning.

However, the GMR Rampala launched the Ruhunu Kumari express as the connection train to Udarata Menike providing the facility of one day trip from Matara to Badulla.
Brush Bagnall did not object to his effort to change their design for he had commanded international recognition as an unmatched railway engineer, who was well versed in mechanical engineering and electrical engineering both and was called Mr. Railway even by the British Locomotive Engineers

It is he who came up with the nomenclature of express services as Ruhunu Kumari, Udarata Menike, Yal Devi, Uttara Devi, Udaya Devi, Mutu Kumari, Samudra Devi, and Podi Menike.
It is sad that the cherished names of these Express trains are no longer used much to the anxiety of the passenger public.
However, they are indelible from the minds of the people, who still call these trains so. The passenger public accuses the authorities of neglecting the need to display the names of these trains as in the past.
Another special anecdote about the CGR during his time was the way he settled a dispute over the naming of a train halt.
When a new train-halt, between Wadduwa and Kalutara North, was named as Waskaduwa, the people in Potupitiya disputed it and it led to a clash between the residents of the two villages.
The train halt was located on the boundary of the two villages. Mr. Rampala resolved the issue by naming the train-halt as Train Halt No.1.
It is the only train-halt in Sri Lanka identified by a number.
He in his capacity as a senior public servant considered it as his duty to look into the difficulties facing the people in the North, who took more than 12 hours for a journey from Colombo to Jaffna
When he commissioned the Ruhunu Kumari express on the southern coastal railway in 1955, he was in the cab of the locomotive in its inaugural trip from Maradana to Matara.
An official of administrative acumen, he upheld the British Traditions of the Department if and when required, to ensure the efficiency of the train service.
Trains ran on time and the coaches were dust and grime-free during his time.
Mr. Rampala as a senior government official of a high calibre never misused his office for personal gain nor he allowed any of his subordinates to resort to official grafting.
If anyone in the department was found committing an offence he would be liable to punishment on the spot.
This brought repute to the Railways Department as a government institution free of corruption during his time.
Mr. Rampala was a teetotaller, but he did not restrict the right of others to be moderate in habits and enjoy.
He in his capacity as a senior public servant considered it as his duty to look into the difficulties facing the people in the North, who took more than 12 hours for a journey from Colombo to Jaffna.
He added Yal Devi express to the Northern line train service and successfully cut down the time taken by the journey to the barest minimum of seven hours. The people in Jaffna hailed this facility and held Mr. Rampala in high esteem.
Replacing the outdated semaphore signal system with the colour signal system was his brainchild.
He found the semaphore signal system maintained at a colossal expenditure an obstacle to the efficiency of the train service.
It was a special feat that he could successfully convert eight garret steam locomotives to be fuelled with furnace oil according to a design of his own. The garret locomotives worked trains in the narrow gauge KV line and in the mainline. However, one of these engines that worked a slow train from Galboda to Nawalapitiya was destroyed by fire due to a technical defect.
A brilliant engineer, Mr. Rampala rectified faults in M1 engines procured from Brush Bagnall Company of the UK.
The manufacturers did not object to his effort to change their design for he had commanded international recognition as an unmatched railway engineer, who was well versed in mechanical engineering and electrical engineering both and was called Mr. Railway even by the British Locomotive Engineers
Large stocks of old rails piled on either side of a railway line, railway compartments, and goods-wagons left to decay in railway yards today would have been a taboo during his time.
During his time, the Railways Department also received donations of locomotives from Canada under the Colombo Plan to help desalination of the train service.
More than 50 years old Canadian engines are still in service and are used to work the main express trains.
People still remember the CGR under Mr. Rampala as the Golden Era of Sri Lanka Railway.
His retirement created a vacuum not only in the Railways Department but also in the public service and it is in doubt whether it could be filled.
The 107th birth anniversary of the late GMR B.D. Rampala fell yesterday. This article pays tribute to that exemplary Public Servant who will be ever remembered
by the people.

The doctor from Ruhuna who founded a new political party recently had received a telephone call from a leading politician with whom once he had close political ties. In fact, this VIP caller was the power behind him in his heyday in politics.

The powerful politico had told the doctor that he wanted to sponsor a loan from him for a political pal in need. Not just chickenfeed! Rs. 30 million or a minimum of Rs. 20 million!
The doctor had replied: Apoi! Budu Sir, I am a poor man now; in fact, I too am trying to raise a bank loan!
However, the powerful politico had learnt since that incident that the doctor had liberally spent several millions on activity designed to place his new party on a sound footing.

Big guns of the Green party are said to be looking into the possibility of forming a government of their own following the expiration of the Green-Blue unity agreement come December.

The Greens have already thrown a net on the JO to hook it en bloc or a section of it to make up the shortfall in the required majority in the council, they say.
However, a JO big shot based in the city and aspiring to Number Two status himself inspired by an astrological prediction, has reportedly expressed vehement opposition to the idea of propping up a Green party-led government. He is said to have told his colleagues: There is no need for us to team up with the Green party. We ourselves are able to go solo!
However, Green party bigwigs are holding on to the hope of forming their own government. Some of them have already begun telling all and sundry that they are set to go it alone if the proposed top team reshuffle in the offing is not carried out the way they want, political sources say.

Trumps credulity about Russia elicits a blowback
	

By Jennifer Rubin 
(c) 2017, The Washington Post 
Former CIA director John Brennan and former director of national intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. appeared on CNNs State of the Union on Sunday and responded forcefully to President Donald Trumps seeming acceptance of Russian President Vladimir Putins claim that he did not interfere in our election. (Trump later clarified his statement to say that he just believed Putin believed this - which is nonsensical. Is he saying Putin doesnt know what is going on in Russia) Brennan had this exchange with CNNs Jake Tapper: 
JAKE TAPPER: What is your response, Mr. Brennan, to what President Trump said about Vladimir Putin and U.S. intelligence agencies 
JOHN BRENNAN, FORMER CIA DIRECTOR: Well, I think Mr. Trump knows that the intelligence agencies, specifically CIA, NSA and FBI, the ones that really have responsibility for counterintelligence and looking at what Russia does, its very clear that the Russians interfered in the election. And its still puzzling as to why Mr. Trump does not acknowledge that and embrace it, and also push back hard against Mr. Putin. The Russian threat to our democracy and our democratic foundations is real. And I think his continuing to not say very clearly and strongly that this is a national security problem, and to say to Mr. Putin, we know you did it, you would have to stop it, because there are going to be consequences if you dont. 
Asked if this posed a danger to the United States, Clapper said the Russians do not harbour good intentions toward the United States, and there shouldnt be any illusions or any ambiguity about that. And our president - the president fosters that ambiguity. Trump is getting played, Clapper said flat-out. Brennan weighed in again: 
Well, I think Mr. Putin is very clever in terms of playing to Mr. Trumps interest in being flattered. And, also, I think Mr. Trump is, for whatever reason, either intimidated by Mr. Putin, afraid of what he could do or what might come out as a result of these investigations. So, its very worrisome. And I think it sends a worrisome, very disturbing signal to our allies and partners who are concerned about Russian interference in their democratic processes as well. So, its either naivete, ignorance or fear, in terms of what Mr. Trump is doing vis-a-vis the Russians. 
The end result is to embolden Putin and demoralize our own intelligence community. I just know that [Trump] has been very determined to try to delegitimize any effort to come up with the truth in terms of this investigation, Brennan said. His attacks on the intelligence community, on the assessment, the attacks on the media, this is an effort to, again, try to undermine those quarters that could pose a serious threat to him. Also, I think it shows the insecurity that he still feels about the election and how Russian interference may have contributed, in fact, to that election. So, I think theres a combination of factors that are motivating the president at this time. 
To sum up, we have a president who is either scared of Putin, getting played by Putin or so emotionally fragile (or some of each) that he cannot acknowledge a factually indisputable attack on Americas electoral democracy. As a result, Trump refuses to take action to protect our electoral system and elevates a thuggish autocrat on the world stage. 
Trump is quite plainly incapable of upholding his oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. Even if he had not attacked democratic norms and institutions (the press, the courts, etc.), and not lied compulsively, and not abused power by pressuring and then firing FBI Director James Comey, Trumps inability to act in the countrys best interests when they conflict with his personal, political and/or financial needs should lead a conscientious member of Congress to consider the extreme device of impeachment as set forth in
the Constitution.

REUTERS, 14 November, 2017- The U.N. aid coordinator called on the Saudi-led coalition to open all Yemens seaports urgently on Tuesday, saying millions of lives were at risk. 
The Saudi-led coalition fighting Yemens Houthi movement said last week it had closed all air, land and seaports in Yemen to stem what it said was the flow of arms to the Houthis from Iran. 
We have some 21 million people needing assistance and seven million of those are in famine-like conditions and rely completely on food aid, U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Yemen Jamie McGoldrick said. 
The continued closure by the Saudi-led coalition of critical seaports and airports is aggravating an already dire humanitarian situation. I think it poses a critical threat to the lives of millions who are already struggling to survive.

UNP passes three separate resolutions
	
The United National Partys Working Committee passed three separate resolutions for the expedition of action regarding cases involving corruption and frauds during the previous rule, it is learnt.
The party resolved that measures should be taken for the appointment of Trial at Bars at High Courts to hear such cases and the appointment of a special prosecution authority under the Attorney General.
It was also resolved that legal provisions should be made available enabling anyone to appeal to the Supreme Court directly against the rulings by the High Court. Currently, such appeals are made to the Court of Appeal.
The resolutions were passed after Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake made a presentation on the progress of investigation to cases of corruption and frauds.
He, in his presentation, said 370 cases had been documented. Of them, 73 have been referred to various institutions for investigation and follow up action. Besides, 92 cases have been referred to the Attorney General. (Kelum Bandara)

Why the placid one got so ruffled
	

The roly-poly Blue senior from Uva stole the scene at the recently held Betel leaf special conference boycotted by the JO when he launched a scathing attack on the top team mate dental doctor, they say.

In an unusually emotive speech, the Uva senior reportedly charged that the false statements being made by the dental doctor at the regular media briefings were causing irreparable damage to the unity of the ruling coalition and the yahapalanaya itself.
Turning to Number One the senior purohita said: Sir, this character caused a big sensation with the announcement that our former boss had billions stashed away in places like Dubai. He claimed he saw the skeletal remains of some dead one. Has any evidence been produced so far to substantiate these allegations Party members question us about these wild allegations when we meet them at party forumsAnd we get stumpedWe have to look fools!
Those who were surprised at the usually placid Uva seniors outburst had later discovered what had really got his goat: he had recently attended a party meeting in his area and had been subjected to much discomfiture and embarrassment when the party members had kept on asking as to what had become of the serious allegations made against the big guns of the former regime specially at regular media briefings. His inability to give satisfactory answers to their questions had provoked an uproar in the audience. Finding that coming colour no good, the purohita had quietly sloped away.
The Blue senior had been nursing a grudge against the dental doctor ever since that incident and he gave vent to his feelings at the recent party conference, they say.

Zimbabwe Army takes control of Harare, 'secures' Mugabe
	
Zimbabwe's army had insisted that President Robert Mugabe was safe as it took over the state broadcaster and arrested a number of senior government officials during a night that saw military vehicles patrolling the streets of the capital while gunfire and explosions rang out, the Telegraph reported today.
Military officers had denied they had carried out a coup, announcing on state TV that they were targeting a ring of government plotters following a power struggle that saw the vice-president flee the country last week.
"It is not a military takeover of government," an army spokesman said in a televised statement. "We wish to assure the nation that his excellency the president... and his family are safe and sound and their security is guaranteed.
"We are only targeting criminals around him who are committing crimes that are causing social and economic suffering in the country in order to bring them to justice.
"As soon as we have accomplished our mission we expect that the situation will return to normalcy."
The address came hours after several loud explosions echoed across central Harare and troops seized the headquarters of the ZBC, Zimbabwe's state broadcaster.
"Although it doesnt look like a coup, it is a coup, Zimbabwe analyst Alex Magaisa, a senior Zimbabwe legal analyst based in the UK, told The Telegraph.
Several cabinet ministers, including local government minister Saviour Kasukuwere and finance minister Ignatius Chombo, and Mugabes nephew Patrick Zhuwayo, were arrested.
There was allegedly a brief gun fight outside Mr Chombos house. All three are part of the G40 faction of Zanu-PF which is loyal to Grace Mugabe, who was being lined up to take over from her husband after the vice-president Emmerson Mnangagwa was fired last week.

Speculation had been mounting throughout the day that a coup was under way against Mr Mugabe, after the head of the armed forces threatened to "step in" over the sacking of an influential vice president.
Gunfire erupted near Mr Mugabe's private residence in Harare in the early hours of Wednesday, a witness has told AFP.
"From the direction of his house, we heard about 30 or 40 shots fired over three or four minutes soon after 2.00 am," a resident who lives close to Mugabe's mansion in the suburb of Borrowdale said.
Two hours later, soldiers overran ZBC, a principal Mugabe mouthpiece, and ordered staff to leave. Several ZBC workers were manhandled, two members of staff and a human rights activist said.
