At least five women raped daily in Indian capital:Police
	

NEW DELHI AFP May 7, 2018- A 17-year-old battled for her life Monday after being raped, doused in kerosene and set on fire, the second such case to shake India as it battles an increase in sexual crimes. 
The teenager was attacked on the same day and in the same eastern state of Jharkhand as a 16-year-old who was raped and burned to death. 
The debate has been heightened further by new police figures indicating that more than five women were raped every day in the Indian capital this year. 
As many as 578 rape cases were reported up to April 15, against 563 in 2017 during the same period, police said. 
The girl has suffered 70 percent first-degree burns. There is a chance that she will survive, Shailendra Barnwal, police superintendent of Pakur district, told AFP. 
Police have arrested a 19-year-old man who lives in the same neighbourhood as the latest victim. 
He poured kerosene on the girl and set her on fire, Barnwal said. The incident occurred on Friday, the same day as the similar case in Jharkhands Chatra district. 
The two cases have shone a spotlight on the treatment of rape in India, where some 40,000 cases were reported in 2016. The country had already been agonising over the brutal gang-rape and killing of an eight-year-old girl in Jammu and Kashmir state, which is to be raised in the Supreme Court on Tuesday.

Coca-Cola Celebrates 132 Years Of Refreshing The World
	

Coca-Cola celebrates 132 years around the world and revels in its status as one of the worlds best loved brands. The history of Coca-Cola has become something of a legend as have the various anecdotes about the brand and its associated symbols. Coca-Cola captured peoples imagination in Sri Lanka first in April 1961, when it was launched in the country. Since then, it has become one of the most loved beverages in the island-nation.

Following the introduction of Trademark Coca-Cola, other global brands were added to the company portfolio including Coca-Cola Light, Coke Zero, Sprite, Sprite Zero, Fanta, Portello, Cream Soda, Lion Soda, Lion Ginger Beer and Kinley water which provide consumers across the island with a variety of delicious and hydrating beverage options. A must-have at every celebration, Sri Lankans cant get enough of the brands wide portfolio of refreshing beverages and the buzz surrounding it.

In Sri Lanka, responding to consumer demand the company launched Sugar-Free options for all its sparkling and fruit flavored beverages. While Coke Zero and Sprite Zero were launched in 2017 Fanta, Portello, Cream Soda and Lion Ginger Beer, were introduced early this year providing consumers with more choice to enjoy the drinks natural flavors and a great, fruity taste without the calories. Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd. is the first company in Sri Lanka to offer sugar free variants of all their great tasting beverages.


Its 132nd anniversary is a great occasion to browse through some fun facts about The Coca-Cola Company:

 American John Stith Pemberton created the original formula for Coca-Cola on May 8th, 1886. Creator Dr. John Pembertons new beverage was first sold at Jacobs' Pharmacy in Atlanta, GA, close to where the headquarters stand today

 Frank Robinson was the one who wrote the name joining the two Cs in Spencerian script, because he thought it would work well in advertising. 132 years later, Coca-Cola still uses the very same script, the same logo, and delivers the same refreshing and delicious taste and brand promise.

 The first year Coca- Cola was sold, in 1886, sales averaged a modest nine drinks per day. Today, 1.9 billion servings of Coca -Cola Company products are sold each day.

 The portfolio comprises of over 4100 products and over 500 brands, including 21 billion-dollar brands.

 In 1887, Coca-Cola was promoted through an innovation developed by The Coca-Cola Company  coupons, providing free samples of the new drink.

 When large-scale bottling began in 1899, in Chattanooga, Tennessee  marking the beginning of what is today the worldwide Coca-Cola bottling system  The Coca-Cola Company leader Asa Candler was so sceptical about the success of bottling Coca-Cola that the Company charged only $1 for the bottling rights, known best as, the Deal of the 19th Century.


 In 1906, the first three countries to bottle Coca-Cola outside the United States were Canada, Cuba and Panama.

 A Coca- Cola bottling plant opened in the Philippines in 1912, the first in Asia.

 In 1977, the contour bottle was granted registration as a trademark by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

 Introduced in 1993, the Coca-Cola Polar Bear has become a favourite part of Coca-Cola advertising, and can be seen in person at the World of Coca-Cola in Atlanta.

 The six-pack carrier, though common today, was an innovation developed by the Coca-Cola system in 1923. It was created to encourage people to take bottles of Coca-Cola home and drink it more often.

 Until 1955, The Coca-Cola Company had only one product  Coca-Cola. In 1955, Fanta was introduced in Italy.

 History was made in 1982 with the introduction of Diet Coke, the first extension of the Coca-Cola and Coke trademarks. Within two years, Diet Coke had become the top low-calorie soft drink in the world, a position the brand maintains today.

 On July 12, 1985, Coca-Cola became the first soft drink to be consumed in space when astronauts tested the "Coca-Cola Space Can" aboard Space Shuttle Challenger.


 Did you know the paintings used in Coke advertising in the mid-1900s helped create the modern image of Santa Claus Thanks to artist Sandblom and Cokes beautiful creation, the snowy white-bearded man, with his rosy cheeks and warm smile that radiates happiness, people around the world have grown to love and cherish a powerful image of Santa that has lived on to delight children and adults alike for nearly a century.

The concept of sustainable development is at the heart of Coca-Cola in Sri Lanka. Coca-Cola implements initiatives to promote societal wellbeing through Sustainable Communities of which three major objectives are; Water Stewardship, Economic Empowerment of Women, and Waste Management. Earlier this year, in January Coca-Cola announced an initiative called World Without Waste. World Without Waste is the Coca-Cola Companys global goal to help collect and recycle the equivalent of 100% of its packaging by 2030. This goal is the centerpiece of the companys new packaging vision in Sri Lanka as well. Through this the Coca-Cola system in Sri Lanka intends not only to make packaging 100% recyclable but also collect and recycle the equivalent of 100% of its packaging in the country and work towards a cleaner and better environment. Our immediate priority and focus through our waste management program entitled Give Back Life is the recovery and recycling of plastic PET bottles. Through this program, collection initiatives have been executed along with the government authorities and a roadmap is in place to ensure all the PET bottles Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd. produces is collected and recycled.

The Free Trade Agreement (FTA) signed with Singapore was detrimental to the country because it would allow the flowing in of cheap labour from countries such as India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, the joint opposition said today.
JO MP Bandula Gunawardana said any company which is registered in Singapore, irrespective of its composition or origin, would be allowed to outsource employees from any country to Sri Lanka.
When a Sri Lankan firm requests Singapore for employees, be it carpenters, painters or masons, Singapore can send employees from other countries to Sri Lanka, he told a news briefing.
The MP said trained and unskilled labourers arriving inSri Lanka would makean impact on the employment of Sri Lankans.
When a hotel of Indian origin requests for Indian labourers to be sent, Singapore can provide them now, he said.
The MP said they were not against any FTA or any particular country and said they are only against the FTAs which would be harmful to Sri Lanka and be beneficial to the other country.
Meanwhile, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman G.L. Peiris said no Singaporean will come to work in Sri Lanka because their salaries are higher than ours.
It is the Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi nationals who would come here through Singaporean firms, because the salaries here are higher than theirs, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Iranaithivus voices of dissent
	
Folks returning to Iranaithivu after 26 years require the support from the Government to stand up and be counted
Scars of the gruesome ethnic conflict are still in their recovery stage. The implementation of the Post-war development plans, especially in the North and East, so far has been slow and hampered by external pressure. Among the many Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) were 187 families from Iranaithivu, which comprises two islands belonging to the Pooneryn Division in the Kilinochchi District. Those displaced moved to Iranaimathaanagar, near Mulankavil in 1992 and eventually housed themselves in makeshift shelters.
But last April these families decided to return to their homeland as their one year long protest to request the return of their lands fell on deaf ears. Upon their arrival, these Tamil families of the Catholic faith have begun to settle down, some with tears of joy, relishing how they once grew up there. But many of them dont have their deeds and they require the support from the Government to stand up on their feet. 
On a recent visit to Iranaithivu, the explored this once prospering island and also spoke to its residents. 

A forgotten island 
Separated by a channel of sea water, Iranaithivu includes Perum Theevu (Big Island) and Sirum Theevu (Small Island), a beautiful island with ponds and crystal clear water. A 45-minute boat ride will take you to this long forgotten island of Perum Theevu in the North, standing out with its vast expanse of greenery  a clear sign of abandonment.


Being a community that thrived on fishing, one could see them throwing their cast nets in search of fish several days after their return. Shelled and abandoned buildings, including a lighthouse dating back to 1886, makes one think of its long history. The main shelter at this island is the Sebamalai Matha Church (Roseiro Church) which has several statues of Mother Mary and Jesus, figures which have been there since the inception of this place of worship. With a school, hospital, three libraries, a church, a post office and the fishing centre this island was once equipped with all facilities. Today there are over 450 families waiting to start a new life on their homeland. Sea cucumbers and mussels could be found in abundance in the shallow waters around the main island and shore-based fishing practices provided an income for the women. The islands waters are also rich in limestone making it a rich breeding ground for several marine species. The island also provides base material to construct houses, in the islands and the mainland.

IDPS, resettlement and the fight to reclaim land

According to the statistics of the Ministry of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs, as at October last year 44,119 families have been resettled in the Kilinochchi District. The remaining 729 families and 2395 persons living with friends and relatives in the same district are yet to be resettled. From 1992, the residents of Iranaithivu were displaced on several occasions, especially during the final phase of the war and they eventually left to Puthumathalan. As at now, people are allowed access to certain areas of the island. These people are still confined to one area in the island. However the once thriving fishing industry has faced many challenges especially with Indian and other local fishermen fishing in the waters. The other factor that stifles their industry is the wastage of fuel. Although numerous appeals were made to the Northern Province Chief Minister, the Prime Minister, the European Union Delegation in Sri Lanka and twice to the President himself in 2017, these challenges still exist. In May 2017, the residents staged a continuous protest in Iranaimathaanagar. These protesting voices were also heard in Pooneryn, Kilinochchi and even Colombo. As an outcome of these protests a series of discussions were held with community leaders and politicians, but the residents see no progress. 

Discussions underway
Speaking to the , Ministry of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs media secretary Dumidu Bandara said that several discussions were held with the military last year. The Navy is planning to setup a radar system on this island as means of tracking illegal Indian fishermen. In that case people would not be allowed to remain in the area. However the Navy Commander also said that they are willing to take it down if the country doesnt blame them in the event there is illegal fishing in Sri Lankan waters. The military has helped these people immensely and already around 40,000 acres of land have been released in the Northern Province. Discussions are currently going on to find alternative solutions for these people. These people prefer to go to their homelands, but with the war there have been certain transactions which the Government and the authorities are still trying to clear out, he said.
Upon visiting Iranaithivu, the learned that the church is the only place for these families to seek shelter. Every other building was shelled and has no roof. As such they have neatly arranged their belongings at a corner under a statue of Mother Mary. People are scattered all over the island and keep walking around to familiarise themselves back in their homeland.

Judicature Act- No intention of political revenge: Thalatha
	
There is no intention of political revenge behind the Judicature Bill which is expected to be passed in Parliamenttomorrow, Justice and Prison Reforms Minister Thalatha Atukorale said today.
She told a media conference the act would accelerate the judicial process which had slowed down during the past and cases would be heard on a daily basis, with powers being vested in the Chief Justice when appointing judges to the permanent High Court Trial-at-Bar.
We have no intention of taking revenge, as what had happened during the previous regime, where people like Shirani Bandaranayake and Sarath Fonseka were victimized when they refused to act on the orders of political higher-ups, the minister said.
It is a known fact that the judicial process during the Rajapaksa regime was not autonomous and efficient, because of the excessive political influence on the judiciary. But now the Judiciary is acting independently, which is the reason to introduce such Acts, to boost and speed up the country's judiciary, she said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Lets hope for a result -oriented policy statement
	
The policy statement scheduled to be made by President Maithripala Sirisena today only fulfils a tradition. Had it been like the one made by the head of the state in the past the Opposition would have made a big fuss about it, on the basis that a vote on it would then be a must and therefore the Opposition would attempt to topple the government by defeating it. However, the policy statements of governments set up after the first Republican Constitution of 1972 are not do-or-die events. 
Todays policy statement would be unique because of the fact that it would be made by a President who is the leader of a political party explaining the policies, programmes and plans of a government mainly consisting of members of a rival party. Though he might call the government as his government, going by the tradition, it cannot be the policy statement of his party, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), but it would be the policy statement of the United National Party (UNP), the main constituent of the government. 
The two parties, when they started their joint political journey in January 2015 as the alternative to the deposed Mahinda Rajapaksa government, promised the country to implement a common political, economic and social programme, instilling high hopes in the minds of the people of this country. However, the past three years saw no nationwide development programme implemented by the two parties, leave alone it being a common programme. 
True, the government had boasted of some programmes, such as the anti-corruption drive and winning the international community but it has proved that the two parties were not in unison on those issues. Also President Sirisena would not be able to boast this time about a government formed by the two main rival parties in the country, as he did when he delivered his previous policy statement in September, 2015, because of the fact that the very same two parties are now at each others throats. 
Eradication of corruption was a main promise given to the people by President Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at the 2015 presidential and parliamentary elections and it was a major issue stressed in the Presidents previous policy statement as well. Yet, the issue later became a bone of contention between the two parties with the Prime Ministers party being accused of conniving with the accused of one of the biggest cases of fraud in Sri Lankas history -- the Central Bank bond scam. Three ministers were compelled to resign from their posts, after they were accused of being hand-in-glove with those involved in high profile frauds, despite two of them having been reabsorbed into the Cabinet later. 
The two parties were also attacking each other at the recently concluded local government elections with the President accusing his partner in governance of aiding and abetting in the Central Bank bond scam. In fact the bickering between the two parties contributed in a big way to the humiliating election defeat suffered by the two parties in governance. The President had even wanted to remove the Prime Minister after the elections while the UNP was wanting to form the government of its own. Finally, admitting that they have no option other than to put up with each other, they settled their issues at least for the moment. It is against this backdrop that the President is delivering his policy statement on behalf of the government in which the UNP has the upper hand. 
So many other differences between the two parties too emerged during the past three years with the President using his executive powers to scrap the institutions formed by the UNP-led government and to revoke some of the decisions taken by the government. 
Thus the policy statement made by the President in 2015 had proved futile. One should expect the President, the Prime Minister and the government as a whole to have learned a lesson from the past. It is the fervent hope of the people that todays policy statement would be one which is pragmatic and result-oriented and the government leaders would collectively work to see it implemented, instead of being at loggerheads with each other.

Making hey while the Sun shines
	

The head of a state-owned establishment is said to be illegally drawing a hefty monthly pay of Rs.800,000.

However, the high-up is doing hardly any work for the establishment to deserve any pay for that matter, say the employees.
He has failed to update the website of the establishment which had once won high recognition from the British Computer Society for its excellence.
The high-up has now rented his own website for the use of the establishment for Rs.200,000 a month, but it is being hardly used to serve the purposes of the establishment,they say.

Mining parapet walls for geuda stones
	

A powerful politico in an area North of the hill city had got a Bodhi Praakara  a parapet wall around a Bodhi  torn down to recover a large haul of geuda stones buried in it, they say.

A gem merchant who put up this Bodhi Praakara several decades ago used earth dug up from gem mines to construct it and the earth thus used abounded with geuda stones which were considered worthless as the heat treatment to convert them into precious stones was not known at that time.
The politico who had come to know that the geuda stones were present in abundance inside the parapet wall had recovered the stones after quietly pulling it down.
The geuda stones fetch a very high price in the market these days, they say.

New light on last stages of the war Michael Roberts unpacks the   Gash Files  
	
A speech by Michael Morris, Baron Naseby, during a debate in the British parliament made news in Sri Lanka last October on account of the testimony he provided relating to the last stages of Sri Lankas 30-year war. Lord Naseby cited dispatches from Lt. Col. Anton Gash, Defence Attache at the British High Commission in Colombo, to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London during this crucial period. They showed the conduct of the Sri Lankan forces in a very different light to the negative one generally projected by western governments and reinforced in mainstream western media. 
It appeared that nobody bothered to gain access to those dispatches to find out what was actually in them  even in the heavily redacted form in which they were released. That task has been undertaken not by the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) as one might have expected, but by an independent academic, Dr. Michael Roberts, Adjunct Associate Professor at the Department of Anthropology, University of Adelaide. Roberts approaches the material with a scholars diligence and a sociologists analytical eye, drawing on insights from his interviews with military personnel, diplomats, scholars, journalists and a variety of other sources. His commentaries on The Gash Files have appeared in his blog (Thuppahis Blog) in recent weeks. 
Gash is still a serving officer attached to the British High Commission in Jamaica writes Roberts. It is doubtful if he can ever divulge his sources of data, but we must remain grateful for the access to his assessments of the unfolding battle and refugee scenes. Praise be to the Lord Michael the Lord Naseby. 
Roberts humorous asides make for entertaining reading at times, while he delves into a tortuous area of study, a veritable mine field of controversy. The main point of interest for Sri Lanka is that Gashs testimony flies in the face of the allegations of human rights abuses during the last stages of the war, that laid the groundwork for a US-UK led resolution in the UN Human Rights Council in 2015. Could the UK reject the testimony of its own officer 
With the clinical detachment of a military man, Gash reported on the manouvres carried out by the Sri Lanka Army (SLA), Navy (SLN) and Air Force (SLAF) to defeat the LTTE under extremely challenging conditions in those last days. He was a first-hand witness to their operations to secure the release of hundreds of thousands of civilians (IDPs). 
In a dispatch dated February 12, 2009 he described the arrival of an ICRC ship bringing Tamil civilians to safety in Trincomalee. This activity supervised by the SLN went on from February 9, 2009 till as late as May 9, 2009. Gash wrote to his masters: 
The operation was efficient and effective, but most importantly was carried out with compassion, respect and concern. I am entirely certain that this was genuine -- my presence was not planned and was based on a sudden opportunity; I had free access to the 300m-long stretch of beach over a 4-hour period and was able to observe upwards of 200 SLN personnel working extremely hard under difficult conditions. Their high morale was notable; they were enjoying the work and clearly finding it satisfying. There were constant examples of thoughtful assistance - looking after babies while mothers were being searched, helping elderly ladies or mothers of babies with their bags, cheerfully offering food etc. 

It appeared that nobody bothered to gain access to those dispatches to find out what was actually in them  even in the heavily redacted form in which they were released
Gash noted in a Comment that  There is real risk that a suicide bomber could cause mass casualties in the beach environment. I was genuinely surprised how calm the atmosphere was in the aftermath of the suicide bomb at the Vavuniya screening centre, and by how much compassion was being shown.Gash went so far as to say, Welfare appeared to be overriding some security considerations.
Roberts does not necessarily agree with Gashs analysis on every point. On March 12, 2009, Gash sent this appraisal: 
The LTTE has been forcing the civilian population to move in accordance with their tactical requirements. The NFZ is rigorously policed and patrolled by LTTE cadres, who control access to food and medical facilities, ensuring that their own needs are met before any capacity is allowed for civilians. 
Roberts, noting that this observation points in the right direction, further contends that, The mass of Tamil civilians was not merely a tactical element. They were a central pillar in the LTTEs grand strategy. He says, They were to (A) function as a defensive fortress of sandbags (i.e. victims, casualties) restraining the offensive weaponry of the GSL forces and (B) serve as an incentive for forceful intervention by Norway, USA and other Western governments  intervention primed by the outcries of HR organisations and concerned peoples (including Tamil organisations) in the West. 
It is in line with this strategy, Roberts argues, that the LTTE from around 2008 began building a picture of an impending humanitarian catastrophe and the prospect of genocide. He goes on to detail the manipulations of diplomats of the US, Norway and others who kept pushing Sri Lanka to drop its goal of defeating the LTTE. the HR agencies, the Western governments and their UN emissaries fell in with the LTTE strategy (induced in part, as it seems outwardly, by humanitarian concerns). They were not mere bystanders. They were active participants in the warring context.

Gashs Situation Reports contain vital information and insights on conditions that prevailed during the wars end, that have been glossed over or ignored in western mainstream medias coverage of it. For example: 
- That  It is not possible to distinguish civilians from LTTE cadres, as few cadres are now in military uniform. (Sitrep 28 January 2009). 
-  the language on TamilNet and other similar platforms is clearly striving for international intervention to force a ceasefire on the GoSL.  (Sitrep 28 January 2009)
- UN reports suggest increasing forced recruitment of women and children by the LTTE, and that many of the LTTE casualties are unwilling recruits (Sitrep 12 March 2009) 
- That the LTTE has been consistently trying to prevent the egress of IDPs other than the most seriously injured (refers to suicide bomber killing nine civilians and wounding 41 at a screening centre near Pulliyampokkani, and the killing of 19 civilians and wounding of 75 by the LTTE as they tried to escape to government held areas. (Sitrep 12 March 2009) 
-  TamilNet allegations continue along the familiar themes of attacks on orphanages, hospitals, cluster munitions, chemical weapons. These are no longer credible,albeit there clearly have been heavy civilian casualties from small arms and mortar fire. - military analysis, 07 April 2009. 
On the much-hyped issue of civilian casualties too, Gashs estimate contradicts the figure put into circulation by the Darusman Report (on which the HRC resolution relies) when he says Leaked UN casualty figures calculate 6,432 civilians killed and 19,946 injured over the last 3 months. The dispatch is dated 26 April 2009. In the three weeks that followed, is it credible that this figure could have rocketed to 40,000

President saying it to retain those left with him: MR
	
Responding to President Maithripala Sirisenas statement that he wont retire in 2020, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa told the Joint Oppositions May Day rally in Galle yesterday that President Sirisena had to say so to hold on to those left with him today by his side.
Addressing the rally which was held at the Samanala Grounds in Galle, Mr. Rajapaksa said the people rejected the United National Party (UNP), Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) at the previous local government election.
That was the clear mandate of the people. However, the President had to make the statement at the May Day rally to keep those who left with him by his side. Otherwise, he would lose them as well. At the same time, Mr. Sirisena is afraid of taking important decisions whereas the government keeps making unproductive decisions such as changing the day of May Day and Vesak, he said.
He said the government lacks the capability of managing the country as the number of dengue cases had increased due to mounting garbage dumps, garbage dumps have been collapsed killing people, prices of essential items including gas and milk power had increased and the underworld figures are roaming free.
Police officers have been deployed to provide security to a wedding of underworld figures. Police baton charges women. The government is incapable of administrating a Grama Niladhari areas let alone a country, he said.
Referring to the Salawa Army Camp Fire, he said the incident was not an accident but a planned event. "Salawa was exploded systematically. Still, no compensation had been paid to the victims," Mr.Rajapaksa said.
Meanwhile, he said both the President and the Prime Minister were attempting to outdo each other. The President said the Premier was surrounded by the corrupt and the Premier set the trap for the Presidents Chief of Staff, he said.
Taking a swipe at the government for fiscal mismanagement, Mr. Rajapaksa said they would salvage the country from what he called a state financial terrorism,
We are ready to fight the state financial terrorism which burdens the masses. We wont dance to the tune of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or other powerhouses, he said.

Putin sworn in for fourth term, promises economic reforms
	

DPA, 07th MAY, 2018- Russia is in need of vast improvements, Vladimir Putin said on Monday as he was inaugurated for his fourth term as president, approaching two decades in power.
The purpose of my life and my work is to serve the people and our fatherland. This is what is most important for me, Putin said in a speech after taking the oath in the Kremlin in front of about 5,000 guests.
Former German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who last year became board chairman of Russian state oil giant Rosneft, stood in the front row between Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and the Russian Orthodox Churchs Patriarch Kirill.
Russia is in need of improvement in many areas to ensure a free and just society, Putin said, adding that the world is rapidly changing and Russia needs to keep up.
The 65-year-old has already been in power for 18 years. He side-stepped a constitutional ban on serving more than two consecutive presidential terms by serving as prime minister between 2004 and 2008.
The country, which still needs to overcome setbacks incurred during the turbulent 1990s, should be modern and dynamic, Putin said, adding that health care and other social services must improve.

SL born Harvard-educated activist writer among women abused by NY State AG
	
New York state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman resigned on Monday after allegations of physical abuse by four women, including a Sri Lankan born Harvard-educated activist writer, the New Yorker magazine reported.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo had called for Schneidermans resignation within hours of the articles publication, and only slightly more than an hour later Schneiderman, a Democrat who was running for re-election, said he was stepping down.
In the last several hours, serious allegations, which I strongly contest, have been made against me, Schneiderman said in a statement. While these allegations are unrelated to my professional conduct or the operations of the office, they will effectively prevent me from leading the offices work at this critical time. I therefore resign my office, effective at the close of business on May 8, 2018.
The New Yorker also reported that four women who said they had had romantic relationships or encounters with Schneiderman said they had been subjected to nonconsensual physical violence.
In the privacy of intimate relationships, I have engaged in role-playing and other consensual sexual activity, Schneiderman said in a statement issued by Stu Loeser& Co before he announced his resignation. I have not assaulted anyone. I have never engaged in non-consensual sex, which is a line I would not cross.
The New Yorker reported that two of the women who spoke to the magazine alleged that he repeatedly hit them, often after drinking, frequently in bed and never with their consent.
Schneiderman, a Harvard-educated lawyer, has been New York States attorney general since late 2010. He has been a high-profile proponent of the #MeToo movement, which has seen accusations of sexual misconduct leveled against prominent men in politics, media, entertainment and business. They include Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein.
One of the victims, Harvard-educated activist writer Tanya Selvaratnam told the New Yorker magazine that her yearlong affair with Schneiderman was a fairytale that became a nightmare  and quickly escalated into violence in the bedroom, even as he begged for threesomes.
Sometimes, hed tell me to call him Master, and hed slap me until I did, Selvaratnam said.
He started calling me his brown slave and demanding that I repeat that I was his property.
Selvaratnam said, The slaps started after wed gotten to know each other.
It was at first as if he were testing me. Then it got stronger and harder. It wasnt consensual. This wasnt sexual playacting. This was abusive, demeaning, threatening behavior.
She said that as the violence grew, so did his sexual demands.
He was obsessed with having a threesome and said it was my job to find a woman, Selvaratnam said. He said hed have nothing to look forward to if I didnt and would hit me until I agreed.
The abuse increased until Schneiderman was not only slapping her but spitting on her and choking her, she said.
He was cutting off my ability to breathe, she said.
Soon, we could rarely have sex without him beating me.
The attorney general was often fueled by booze, Selvaratnam said.
And he would push her to drink, too, she said.
A friend finally helped her leave him, Selvaratnam said.

Some notes on the popular (music) culture
	
The young of today are caught up, I think, in a curious contradiction. They want to rebel, to let the world know they are not satisfied, but they also want to hide behind a certain welter of security. Their heroes are the singers and the actors who adorn the recent popular culture: heroes shirked as outsiders, who indulge in the cosmetics of rebellion with the privilege of returning to a more secure life once their rebelliousness is done away with. The urban youth, in particular, are transfixed by this fusion of opposites  security and rebellion  and they shape their preferences in the arts based on their preference for that sort of fusion. (They want to have the cake and eat it too, in other words). A long way from home, but still near that home, the young are confused. Not that they need a guide. But they seem to be lost. And they seem to revel in the fact that they are.
Its probably not a coincidence that the art form that appeals to these youngsters and teenagers the most is music, because music, with or without accompanying visuals, is the one art form that depends for its endurance on the doing away of a barrier between the artist and his or her audience. The tastes of the latter are at the outset the tastes of the former; theres no effort made at mediating the consciousness of either group to equalize it to that of the other. For that reason, the milieu that the artist  in real life or in his work  belongs to happens to be the same milieu that his or her fan base comes from, and moreover revels in. Those who vouch for, and adore, Sanuka Wickramasinghe and Nadeemal Perera and Ridma Weerawardena dont take to Chamara Weerasinghe, for instance, because Chamara isnt sophisticated enough for their elegant, urbane tastes.
Sanuka and Nadeemal and, to a certain extent, Ridma are exponents of a specific variety of Sinhala music. Its the sort that thrives on youth and sophistication: the careful inflections, the precise accents, necessitate a balancing act between the urbanness of their fan base and the Sri Lankan-ness of their other listeners. Largely secular, cosmopolitan, and cut off from the wellsprings of our traditional art forms, their most ardent fans affirm a musical idiom that is closer to the city. And because the city flourishes through a contrapuntal mixture of rebellion and conformity, these three vocalists appeal, not to adolescent dreams, but to the rift between those dreams and the lives that the adolescents in the city have to put up with. One night stands, romances that never take off, first romances: these experiences can be articulated only by those who have the luxury of an alternative life, and this life Sanuka and Nadeemal celebrate in song after song.
For some reason, beat bands are, in Sri Lanka, considered populist. With a few exceptions, such bands have been associated with cheap, easy music, having very little instrumentation and virtually no acoustics. Even the vocalists who opt to sing with these bands are judged harshly and put down. Such an attitude, of judging them on how sophisticated their voices are, betrays a set of insidious class prejudices: you dont like Chamara because he isnt cool enough, because he isnt equipped with the symbols of chic sophistication (the slick, combed hair; the alienating, imposing sunglasses; the casual, reluctant smile) that Bathiya, Santhush, and Sanuka project. With his idiosyncratic and sun-baked face, Chamara is a hero to the downtrodden and the dispossessed, who listen to him while travelling in the bus and who dont have the money to repair their own broken radios (and lives) back home. Musically, those who dote on Sanuka et al are sophisticated, or at least THINK theyre sophisticated (when they are not).
The same can be said of Saman Lenin, whose popularity is, however, different to Chamaras just as Chamaras popularity is different to Sanukas. The music that Lenin affirms is the music of the past, which comes up from the wellsprings of the Sinhala language, i.e. the rural and spoken variant. Chamara Weerasinghe is not a purist like this: he is willing and he has made compromises over the years to win at least a section of the pop audience that Sanuka has monopolized, even those who dont usually take to beat bands that easily. Lenin doesnt really make compromises like that. He has been singing of the village and he returns to the village in song after song; music videos are at best expendable to him, and if he will resort to it, it will be the type of video we see every day on television (which focuses on the vocalist, and spares little time for the unfolding of a narrative). 

Careful inflections, precise accents, necessitate a balancing act between the urbanness of their fan base and the Sri Lankan-ness of their other listeners
Baila began with the Kaffirs, i.e. their dialects and dances. It found its 20th century indigenous proponent with Wally Bastian, right before we attained independence (in the forties). From Bastian and his successor, Desmond Kelly, we come to M. S. Fernando and Anton Jones, both of whom appealed to a different milieu: more vernacular, more home-grown, they were despised by the upper and middle classes, who shirked them and pandered to the likes of Clarence and The Moonstones and Calypso. From Fernando and Jones, we come to Dalreen and Desmond Fernando and Mariazelle Goonetilake, who more or less returned to the classist exuberance that Bastian and Kelly had revelled in. Like Clarence, they thrived on a separation of the householder from the servant (a separation which M. S. and Anton refused to make or continue, since they sang almost completely about the hard done by petty bourgeoisie, along with the urban proletariat), and from them, we come to Paul Fernando, Christopher Paul, and Punsiri Soyza, all three of whom hailed from Moratuwa and all three of whom took baila to the milieu that M. S. and Anton had celebrated before.
Perhaps its pertinent to note that even a vocalist like the late (and forever unequaled) W. D. Amaradeva evoked different responses from different audiences. Amaradevas early period, as some have observed, comprised of compositions and songs which tried to keep up with the experiments that Sunil Shantha was conducting. His second period, after his return from Shantiniketan and before he fused the raghadari tradition with the Sinhala quatrain, saw him dabble in calypso and baila: these songs (Atha Gaw Ganan Durinand Pipi Pipi being two of them, the former written by Mahagama Sekara) are the songs we have that remind us that the man came from a largely coastal environment, which reacted, not to the profundity of Sinhala poetry, but the saltiness of a genre that brought their community together, in dance and drinkand revelry.
In abandoning this phase for the phase in which he gave out Kumariyaka Pa Salamba Saluna and Ma Mala Pasu and so on, Amaradeva, I think, was inadvertently appealing to the same milieu which had helped prop up the cultural revolution of 1956: not the peasantry, who reacted with mixed feelings to the (supposedly) Sinhalised movies of Lester James Peries and ballets of Chitrasena, but the petty bourgeoisie. The children of this petty bourgeoisie grew up listening to Amaradeva on the one hand and Clarence on the other; it was a bifurcation of tastes within the same milieu which ignored if not marginalised the efforts of Lionel Ranwala, and Piyasiri Wijeratne (if you search for Badde Pura on YouTube, almost all the search results will make you think that it was sung by Amitha Wedisinghe only; Piyasiri is forgotten today because he was forgotten in his time), to take our music beyond the raag and Western melody.

Going by this, the grandchildren, of the children who were responsible for 1956, have evolved to appreciate Sanuka and Nadeemal and Ridma over Chamara and Saman Lenin because their tastes are somewhat genetic, conditioned at the outset by the environment they are in and the families they are born to. In one sense, I think such a separation, mostly hereditary, is to be welcomed, because it helps us understand the complex array of sensibilities which goes into the shaping of vocalists and musical forms. On the other hand, if we continue to make this an excuse for ignoring the musical Other, we will only be poorer. The true aesthete, Ive always felt, sheds class-bound sensibilities. The tragedy is that we are not a nation of aesthetes. We are a nation of human beings. And we are flawed.

Sri Lankan tourism sector on the cusp of accelerated growth phase in 2018/19
	
Steven Mayes, Managing Director at Jones Lang LaSalle Sri Lanka.

 Consistent policy framework vital to capitalize on rising international profile
 Commends Budget 2018 initiatives to boost growth, develop domestic airports and aero sports
 Recommends continued digitization of services to capture growing millennial market

Global real estate consultancy Jones Lang La Salle (JLL) anticipates a strong surge in tourist arrivals and earnings, which could be further enhanced by steps to ensure a transparent regulatory framework and improvements in soft infrastructure.

Noting that two of Sri Lankas largest tourist markets, India and China, will account for 25% of the total global population, including the worlds largest population of millennials, JLL cautioned that the opportunity cost to Sri Lanka could be high, if it fails to follow through on key initiatives and does not sideline marginal policies that limit potential for a positive contribution to the industrys performance.
There is no magic wand, all policies need further refinement, transparency and efficient implementation if all stakeholders are to benefit from improved confidence amongst local or joint venture entrepreneurs and the tourist community, especially in this era of digital social media where news, good or bad, can go global in the blink of an eye, the report stated.

Smart moves to capture the big dragon

In addition to a transparent regulatory framework, to assist the tourism sector, JLL stated that it would be critical to have a strong soft infrastructure in place in order to provide Chinese tourists with a streamlined experience. It refers to services like Fliggy - an online travel platform, which acts as an online mall for brands, and is part of Chinas Alibaba digital ecosystem  which recently established its Sri Lanka Pavilion with the aim of attracting a million tourists to the island each year.

According to the statistics, provided by China National Tourism Administration, over 62.00 million outbound trips were made by the Chinese in Q1 of 2017, therefore it quickly becomes apparent how important this market may become to the tourism sector in Sri Lanka. The total consumption by Chinese travelers overseas reached $109.8 billion, at an average spend of around $900 per person in the year 2016.

One of the key reasons for this outbound growth, amongst Chinese tourists, is convenient access to reciprocal visa policies with 65 countries around the globe. In addition, 90% of Chinese citizens do not have passports for foreign travel, outlining the tremendous growth potential from this market.
Alibaba has also launched an Online visa center for Sri Lanka, which is a prudent move to attract millennials and other Chinese tourists to apply for visas via their smartphones at their convenience.
The tourism sector is critical to the future prosperity and global standing of Sri Lanka, and prudent leveraging of geographical advantages, FTAs, Sri Lankas natural heritage, cultural highlights and current standing as a tourism hotspot are required to contribute significantly to GDP and wealth distribution, amongst the population, spurring infrastructure improvements to the benefit of all.

It is beholden on elected government ministers and public bodies to engineer a legislative framework that provides clarity and consistency in developing this key element of the nations future, safeguarding existing relationships and promoting Sri Lanka to open new markets, JLL explained.
JLL also commended moves to refine Sri Lankas attractiveness as a destination through such initiatives as the continuing development of domestic airports at Sigiriya, Batticaloa, China Bay and Koggala, which would likely encourage both local and foreign tourism with increased revenues. This in turn would pave the way for further investment in infrastructure.

Similarly, JLL noted that the Governments Open Skies for Aero Sports initiative  spanning activities such as Hang Gliding, Ballooning, Dirigibles, Parachutes and Paragliders together with the removal of NBT and PAL levies on non-powered aero sport equipment holds strong potential as an attraction for young adults, particularly millennials from China, India and other growth geographies. The report further noted that such initiatives would also support growth of direct and indirect job opportunities in associated businesses.

Status of ICT Laws   Were incompetent in dealing with computer related laws  
	
one of the Leading professionals in ICT LawSunil D. B. Abeyrathne says that Sri Lankans are unaware of the responsibility they bear when entering cyberspace and using digital devices

The ultimate solution would be to digitize the court system
	We have now started an e-filing system only for fundamental rights applications
	There are no laws or policies to ensure cyber security, privacy or data protection in Sri Lanka
	If we upload something against national security, it is an offence under section 3 of the ComputerCrime Act
	It is sad that the Sri Lanka Police is not only reluctant, but also incompetent in carrying out investigations properly
	An instance where technology can be adopted is in the filing of fundamental rights applications

It would go uncontested if one opines that the best words to define the 21st century is Digital Age. We live in a world where we simply cannot do without digital devices and the internet. As much as we eat food and inhale air, we are constantly engaged in the cyber world. Although millions are connected to their mobile phones, laptops and computers all the time, very few are aware of the laws that govern their usage. Its almost pathetic to known that one might not even be aware that he or she is committing a cyber crime or infringing on intellectual property rights. It is also dangerous that we do not know if the data that we provide to internet sources are secured and whether our privacy is protected. The Dailymirror decided to interview Attorney-at-Law Mr. Sunil D. B. Abeyratne, one of the leading professionals in ICT (Information, Communication and Technology) Law, to
know more.
QWhat are the laws that are related to technology and internet usage in Sri Lanka
There are four main pieces of legislation that govern technology and internet usage in Sri Lanka. We can refer to them collectively as ICT Laws. They include the ICT Act (2003), the Electronic Transactions Act (2006) and Computer Crime Act (2007). Under the Evidence Special Provisions Act of 1995, computer evidence and audiovisual contemporaneous evidence can be admitted as evidence in cases. The judges are given enough discretion under the existing legal framework to allow for admission of electronic evidence in litigation. Although these laws exist, they are not properly implemented in Sri Lanka.
QDo you mean to say that the legal system in Sri Lanka is not properly benefiting from the existing legal framework governing ICT
Precisely. To give an example, although the Evidence Special Provisions Act of 1995 allows for electronic evidence to be admitted to court, there has been only ONE decided case so far where computer evidence was admitted. More than 25 years have passed since the adoption of this particular legislation, but there is no application or utilization of it.
Admission of evidence is even simplified under this act than the original Evidence Ordinance, because there is no classification as primary and secondary evidence. It is sad that the Sri Lanka Police is not only reluctant, but also incompetent in carrying out investigations properly. They are sometimes not even aware of the fact that electronic evidence can be valid evidence. Its an unfortunate situation that such a useful provision, which, if practised, would not only make the litigation process more efficient, but would most definitely assist in justice being delivered. The Attorney Generals department, Unofficial Bar, Sri Lanka Police, lawmakers and the judiciary are all responsible for this.
QDo you think that the existing law is sufficient to ensure the genuineness of electronic evidence
Yes. Under our law, electronic evidence is admitted only if certain criteria are fulfilled, as prescribed by the existing legal framework. For example, a statement produced by a computer is admissible only if it is capable of being perceived by the senses , if the computer is operating properly, if the information supplied to the computer is accurate and the statement reproducing the information is accurate. I believe the law is more than adequate to ensure that this kind of evidence is genuine. In other countries, the Governments from time to time introduce regulations, which we are not doing. The same risk of lack of confidentiality and integrity can apply to ordinary evidence, so there is no need to doubt the genuineness of electronic evidence only.

What the authorities did was block access to Facebook. By this, we showed the entire world that we are incapable of handling the situation, that we are incompetent in identifying perpetrators and dealing with computer related laws.
QCan technology be used to assist the legal system apart from the laws that are alreadyin place
The legal field is the last profession to adopt technological development and the most hesitant to move away from traditional methods. All the other fields like the medical and business fields have used technology to the maximum. Without technological devices and the internet, those professionals cannot operate. How many technological devices and computers would you see inside an operation theatre All these high-rise buildings are designed using computers. But what happens in the legal field is, we stick to the age-old methodologies which is one of the main reasons for the inability to meet justice and for the delay in cases.
An instance where technology can be adopted is in the filing of fundamental rights applications. According to our constitution, a fundamental rights application must be filed within one month of the infringement. When it comes to finding a lawyer, making the necessary preparations and coming to the Supreme Court, usually the one month elapses and the victims are left without any remedy. We have now started an e-filing system only for fundamental rights applications where petitioners can email their petition to the registrar. This is the system followed in Australia and the United States. But the issue is the general public and the police officers are unaware of these developments.
The ultimate solution would be to digitize the court system, which if done, can cut down 90% of courts delays.
QDo you think Sri Lanka was better equipped to handle the racism propagated through social media during the recent internal disturbance
If we upload something against national security, it is an offence under section 3 of the Computer Crime Act. When the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) encountered the challenge of handling hate posts on social media, which enhanced the racial propaganda, there was minimum court action. What the authorities did was block access to Facebook. By this, we showed the entire world that we are incapable of handling the situation, that we are incompetent in identifying perpetrators and dealing with computer related laws. It is even amusing how despite this Facebook ban, everyone including the President, Prime Minister and the Minister in charge of Digital Infrastructure (who defended himself as he was in Dubai) was logged in using VPN.

For example, a statement produced by a computer is admissible only if it is capable of being perceived by the senses, if the computer is operating properly and if the information supplied to the computer is accurate
QCan you explain the position of Sri Lanka in relation to ICT Law when compared with other countries
Sri Lanka is actually a pioneer when it comes to ratifying international and regional conventions related to ICT Law. We have signed both important conventions. Even countries like Japan and India havent adopted these conventions. When ratifying international conventions, what usually happens, is the members of the executive attend these conferences and without any knowledge and understanding of their capabilities, they straight away ratify these conventions. However, ironically, when it comes to adopting them and implementing them, we are lagging behind. There are special and simplified procedures provided by the law in relation to computer crimes where the police can even obtain the help of university graduates who hold the qualification Bachelor of IT. They can perform several tasks without even receiving a court order. But non of this is implemented. We must research on how other countries have enforced their laws and integrated the culture of responsibly using the internet and digital devices and educate our society.
QWhat is the status of cyber security, privacy and data protection in Sri Lanka
There are no laws or policies to ensure cyber security, privacy or data protection in Sri Lanka. Although hacking and some other activities are offences under the Computer Crime Act, a remedy cant be offered to a citizen if his or her sensitive data is withheld. There are no laws related to the use of CCTV cameras. There was once an issue where CCTV cameras were fixed inside changing rooms of a textile shop and the videos were misused. Although the police managed to trace the owner, there was no law to hold him liable. When there are no data protection laws, on-line transactions arent safe. This has a direct impact on our trade because some countries are reluctant to enter into transactions with us due to the lack of security in these on-line transactions. If a country wants to actually enter into international trade and commerce, then there must be directives and policies to protect data.

The legal field is the last profession to adopt technological development and the most hesitant to move away from traditional methods. All the other fields like the medical and business fields have used technology to the maximum
QAre people aware of the laws governing the ICT field
If the next I-Pad is introduced today, it is available in our market tomorrow. That is the speed and enthusiasm we have to use new technology. But when the virus guards or firewalls in our computers continuously remind us to renew or upgrade them, we dont care and we conveniently ignore them. That is the status of the awareness of Sri Lankans. People are unaware of the responsibility we have to carry when we enter cyberspace and use digital devices. If the education ministers have been smart enough to introduce ICT as a subject for olevel students, why cant they introduce a chapter on ICT Law If this was done, I think from an early age, people will be aware of the responsibility entailed to using information and communication technology.

The Engineering Nexus - Galvanizing Sri Lankan tech
	
Hasitha Liyanage, Snr. Director Technology and Architecture at Sysco LABS introduced the Island of Ingenuity  Sri Lanka Knowledge Services brand, launched recently to position Sri Lanka as an investment destination for tech companies looking to expand globally
The inaugural Engineering Nexus meetup was hosted at the Sysco LABS engineering center recently, marking the launch of another initiative to help grow and develop the software engineering and technology development practice in Sri Lanka. Unlike other meetups, the Engineering Nexus intends to solve tech problems by bringing together ideas and methodologies from different disciplines within tech organizations together. Therefore, the three speakers who addressed the audience Anjana Chandrapala, IVS Security Lead at Virtusa (Pvt) Ltd, Roshan Razik, Director Hosting Operations, at Pearson Lanka (Pvt) Ltd and Hasitha Liyanage, Snr. Director Technology & Architecture at Sysco LABS (Pvt) Ltd all specialized in different areas but came together to discuss the problem of Engineering Productivity.
The Engineering Nexus was started with a desire to address a problem that exists within the industry; that technologists tend to think in silos when it comes to solving problems and fail to see that there may be simpler solutions to their problems if they can bring in practices from different disciplines. To this end the three speakers were not just from different organizations, but also had different technical areas of focus; Quality Engineering, DevOps and Software Architecture. They all spoke on techniques from within their technical focus area that can be used to improve an organizations Engineering Productivity overall.
Roshan Razik  Director Hosting Operations at Pearson Lanka (Pvt) Ltd, Anjana Chandrapala  IVS Security Lead at Virtusa (Pvt) Ltdand Hasitha Liyanage  Snr. Director Technology and Architecture at Sysco LABS (Pvt) Ltd atthepanel discussion led by AsiriLiyanage Senior Software Architect at Sysco LABS (Pvt) Ltd.
Speaking on the event, Hasitha Liyanage said, I spoke on using data as a tool to help you to be more productive by making smarter decisions about what work you should focus on. It was really interesting as a software architect to be able to share my viewpoint on the subject of Engineering Productivity because that is a subject that is usually the focus area of Quality Engineering, but that is the power of the Engineering Nexus. I think the Nexus has great potential and I really want to encourage other tech leaders in the industry to join and collaborate on future events.
As the recent launch of the Island of Ingenuity brand for Sri Lankas Knowledge Solutions industries illustrates, the nations tech sector is on the rise and there is abundant scope and insight available in the industry. It is the support of this industry that will be key to the growth and expansion of the Engineering Nexus; as it will be the industry leaders who will host events, identify key focus areas to base the sessions around and share their valuable knowledge and best practices.
Discussing his experience speaking at the Nexus, Anjana Chandrapala highlighted three key principles to adhere by, in order to optimize the traditional software development process to make it capable of delivering solutions to a consumer driven, fast paced market. First, reduce waste by eliminating unwanted efforts during the life-cycle and by applying best practices such as defect prevention mechanisms. Second, focus efforts on what matters the most by utilizing scientific measures such as pair-wise algorithm. And finally, automate throughout the life cycle to get redundant jobs done faster, which leaves you room for creativity and quality.
Roshan Razik shared the challenges of managing and supporting large business critical platforms and infrastructure at Pearson and the Continual Service and Operational improvement initiatives employed to overcome them for increased productivity. There are three facets to our approach; persistent productivity, continual improvement, and innovation. They have enabled our TechOps teams to transform into a service-aligned team. Our key success factors for 2018 are Agile, Enhanced Customer Experience, Enabling Cloud, and Automation.
If all goes to plan we should see more Engineering Nexus meetups within the year. Complete videos of the speeches from the first meetup can be viewed at syscolabs.lk.

## Title: The unfinished business of partition haunts India and Pakistan
## Section: News Features

The unfinished business of partition haunts India and Pakistan
	
When the British Empire rid itself of the Indian subcontinent in 1947, the latter was divided to establish a predominantly Hindu India and a predominantly Muslim Pakistan according to a set of principles which included the religious composition of the population and geographical contiguity with India and the two wings of Pakistan (one in the West and the other in the East). 
Hurriedly brought about between 1946 and 1947, partition has been an extremely divisive issue which is plaguing relations between the two countries to this day. 
It immediately led to horrendous Hindu-Muslim riots in Northern and Eastern India; the transfer of populations involving millions; and a short war over the disputed Muslim-majority princely state of Kashmir in 1948.
Indias continued bid to keep Kashmir, and Pakistans relentless bid to seize it have led to two full scale wars; the transformation of East Pakistan into an independent Bangladesh through an India-supported armed struggle; unrest in Kashmir exploited and fanned by Pakistan; and Pakistans bid to weaken India by promoting cross border terrorism. 
Since 1947, support for the separatist movement in Kashmir has been an article for faith for every political party in Pakistan. The issue prevents Islamabad from cooperating with India, no matter what the issue. On the Indian side, Pakistans relentless bid to seize Kashmir or inflict on it a thousand cuts through devastating terrorist acts, has been affecting the political, economic and social status of Muslims who had chosen to remain in India after partition. 
Although post-partition India chose to be a secular state, and has been largely so, communalism has raised its ugly head in Northern and Western India many times to keep the Muslim population on tenterhooks. And electoral politics based on mobilization of communities and other primordial loyalties has kept the pot of communalism boiling. 
After partition, the then dominant Congress party and the Left, co-opted the Muslims and the Backward Castes. But the Hindu majoritarian and rights wing parties,which were challenged by this electoral team up, vigorously promoted Hindu consolidation in opposition to the Muslims and the Backward Class movements. 
Cross-border terrorism encouraged by Pakistan over the Kashmir issue helped the Hindu majoritarian and Right wing forces to divide the Hindus from the Muslims. Over time, secular, cross-religions electoral alignments weakened. This was reflected in the phenomenal rise of the fortunes of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its ideological adjuncts called the Sangh Parivar. 
From the late 1980s onwards, the war between Hindu majoritarianism and the Muslim-Backward Classes coalition intensified. This was partly triggered by the Left leaning V. P. Singh Govts bid to reserve 27% of seats for the Backward Classes in government and education sectors as per the Mandal Commissions report. The beleaguered Hindu majoritarian forces met this challenge by re-unifying the Hindus and this was sought to be done by turning all Hindus, irrespective of caste, against the common enemy; namely, the Muslims.
The consolidation was facilitated by two other factors: First, the instability in the Central government brought about by the decline of the Congress and the inability of the non-Congress Left of Centre parties to run a stable and credible government. Second, the intensification of unrest in Muslim majority Kashmir which India attributed to Pakistans machinations there. 
The high point of cross-caste Hindu consolidation, and the anti-Muslim movement was the demolition of a medieval mosque in Ayodhya built by the first Moghul Emperor Babar in 1992. The plan was to build, on the site, a temple for Lord Rama as it was thought to be his birthplace. 
The demolition of the Babri Masjid did bring about Hindu consolidation to an extent. The process was expedited by the Muslims response to it. Terrorist bombings in Mumbai and other parts of India, allegedly done by Pakistan-inspired or Pakistan based Islamic groups, resurrected and sharpened anti-Muslim, anti-Pakistan and anti-partition feelings among an increasing number of Hindus, cutting across caste, regional and linguistic divisions. 
All this led to the rise of the BJP, now under the charismatic Narendra Modi. The Modi wave gave the BJP a road roller majority in parliament in May 2014 and resulted in the partys capturing power in most Indian States barring those in the South. 
Now, anti-Muslim and anti-Pakistan rhetoric is routinely used by the Hindu-majoritarian Right wing parties every time there is an election. The Congress, Left of Centre and Left parties which are avowedly secular are dubbed as pro-Pakistan and therefore anti-national. This is done especially when the BJP is facing a tough contest and is fighting with its back to the wall as was the case in Bihar and Gujarat recently. 
During the hard fought elections in Bihar, BJP President Amit Shah said that if the Centre-Left combination won the elections, there would be celebratory fireworks in Pakistan. This was repeated in the Gujarat elections by Prime Minister Modi himself. He even accused formerPrime Minister Manmohan Singh and some Congress leaders of plotting to defeat the BJP in cahoots with the Pakistani High Commissioner over a dinner meeting in New Delhi. 
And now, with elections due in several states and the parliamentary elections coming up in May 2019, the Muslim-Pakistan factor is being raked up again. 
A BJP leader in Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh, suddenly discovered a portrait of Pakistans founder, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, in the office of the Students Union of the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), a Centrally funded but autonomous minority institutions. The portrait had been there for the last 80 years as Jinnah had given funds to the university in its early days. And he was not alone. There were portraits of other contributors and Indian national leaders too on the wall. 
A new Hindu extremist group Hindu Yuva Vahini then attacked the university besieging its students and teachers. These fought back until the police restored order. However, to avoid further trouble, the university authorities removed Jinnahs portrait. 
But the incident served the Hindu Right wings purpose of reviving the controversy over the vivisection of Mother India, the creation of a Muslim majority state of Pakistan and Jinnahs villainous role in it. 
This is expected to help the consolidation of the Hindu vote, help overcome caste divisions among Hindus and prevent these divisions from being exploited by the secular and Left parties in the coming State and national elections. It would also take the sense out of the Congress policy of cultivating the Muslim minority. 
Aware of this, the Congress started soft pedaling the Muslims case. In the Gujarat elections, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi conspicuously avoided the company of Muslims and preferred to make highly publicized visits to Hindu temples instead. 

Anti-Muslim and anti-Pakistan rhetoric is routinely used by the Hindu-majoritarian Right wing parties every time there is an election
But regardless of the Congress lily-livered approach, independent and secular media in India have condemned the action of the Hindu Rights attacks on AMU and brought into the open top BJP leaders laudatory references to Jinnah in the not too distant past. 
The Congress party itself has been silent, though. In fact, when one its pro-Muslim leaders Mani Shankar Aiyer recently referred to Jinnah by his honorific Qaid-e-Azam the Congress spokesman dissociated the party from the remark saying that Aiyer is not a member of the party. He is under suspension for describing Modi as a tea boy in a speech during the Gujarat elections. 
In his 2009 book, Jinnah-Indian Partition-Independence, former BJP leader and Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh had blamed the centralist policies of the Congress leader Jawaharlal Nehru and not Jinnah for the partition of India. In Singhs view, if only Nehru had accepted Jinnahs proposal for forming autonomous Muslim provinces within India, India would have remained one country. 
In 2005, another BJP leader who was Indias Deputy Prime Minister L. K. Advani had gone to Jinnahs mausoleum in Karachi and had written in the visitors book that Jinnah was a secular leader and addressed him as Qaid-e-Azam.
In his early years, Sarojini Naidu, a leading luminary of Indias freedom struggle, described Ali Jinnah as an Ambassador of Hindu-Muslim unity. His address to the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan on August 11, 1947, is really a classic, a forceful espousal of a secular state in which, while every citizen would be free to practice his own religion, the state shall make no distinction between one citizen and another on grounds of faith. My respectful homage to this great man,Advani wrote. 
With the media recalling what its own past leaders had said about Jinnah, BJP would find it a bit difficult to pursue the anti-Jinnah line in the forthcoming election campaigns. 
But the bid to consolidate the Hindu vote on the basis of differences with the minorities, especially the Muslims, will be part of the BJPs political stock in trade, especially because it appears to have paid dividends.
