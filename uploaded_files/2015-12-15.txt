Once bitten, twice shy
	
A very high post at secretarial level is due to fall vacant in a few weeks, they say.
Now the yahapalanaya top brass are looking for a person possessing outstanding administrative skills and proficiency in both official languages for this coveted white collar job.?
Meanwhile, a certain political authority had offered this high post to a highly respected administrator now on retirement, on the recommendation of a white collar one who once held this office.?
However, the response he got from the retired administrator was something wholly unexpected. ?Please don?t misunderstand me,? he began. ?I have suffered enough while doing my best for the good of the country. Please offer this post to someone else. I am prepared, of course, to extend my co-operation from a safe distance???

A stickler for yahapalanaya principles, but he had to go
	
The Customs got a new chief last week. Incidentally, he was the third to be appointed in quick succession to this key post under the Yahapalanaya.
Many inquisitive ones naturally made inquiries as to why the Customs Chief despite being a stickler for yahapalanaya principles was suddenly ousted. And they soon discovered the reason behind the virtual ouster: He had refused to carry out orders from powerful politicians. ?
The latest ?wrong? done by him was the sealing of a container shipment imported by some close pals of a political high authority from Rajarata. The Customs Chief had stuck to his guns despite repeated requests to release the containers.
The Customs Chief later found himself at the receiving end of abuse from the disgruntled political high ups and he quit the post in utter disgust and returned to his old job, they say.?

Allianz Lanka receives NCC recognition for contribution to financial literacy
	
		 		 
		 
			
Allianz Lanka was recognised at the prestigious National Chamber of Commerce (NCC) awards for the company?s corporate social responsibility (CSR) project, ?My Finance Coach?, which increased the financial literacy of nearly 5,000 youth in about 30 schools throughout Sri Lanka.?
The area of financial literacy has been neglected by countries worldwide and studies have confirmed that more and more youth struggle with debt in their daily lives.
For this initiative, the NCC recognised Allianz Lanka with a Merit award in the Best Sustainability Project category. This is the first time ever that a project of this nature has been introduced to Sri Lankan youth and also the first time that the project has been put forward for recognition.
My Finance Coach aims to instruct youth on smart money management and raise their awareness of the consequences of their financial decisions. The approach arms youth with the tools needed to be financially competent citizens and create a financially stable future for them.
Statistics confirm that Sri Lankans too are becoming increasingly more in debt to banks and financial institutions due to lack of awareness of how to balance their needs and wants. Allianz Lanka believes that by educating teenagers on the threshold of adulthood on financial literacy this situation will be mitigated to some extend in the future.?
The target audience for the programme is students aged between 15 and 17 years. The programme teaches them about business and finance in a way that is relevant to their everyday lives, using interactive practical examples and exercises that are easy to understand and remember. Feedback received proves that the project is very popular not only among schoolchildren but also with teachers and parents. Allianz Lanka has received many commendations and requests to introduce the project to more schools.
My Finance Coach was first introduced in Germany by Allianz Lanka?s parent company Allian SE and was brought to the Sri Lankan shores in November 2013. The insurer is now working with the Education Ministry to take this project forward and aims to have the project included in the syllabus of schools in the future.
Allianz Lanka has a robust CSR policy that has introduced many sustainable development initiatives that have improved the quality of life of communities and protected the environment in which it operates. Another popular initiative for youth introduced by the company is the sponsorship of young football enthusiasts to attend the annual international football camp in Germany and train alongside the prestigious FC Bayern football team.

"Release Army intelligence officers as done to ex-LTTEers"
	
	Family members of Army intelligence officers who were arrested and detained under the PTA in connection with the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda today requested the government to release their loved ones similar to the way in which ex-LTTE detainees were released.
	They expressed these views at a news conference organsed by the Mawbima Wenuwen Ranawiruwo organisation which was held in Colombo.
	Convener of the Organization Major Ajith Prasanna pointed out that these ex-LTTE cadres were not released solely following a judicial process but on the instructions of the President and the Prime Minister.
	Therefore, he said army intelligence officers too should be released in a similar way. ?Even charge sheets had been filed against these officers. The government should reveal why they were detained under the PTA. What act of terrorism did these officers commit? They had been detained for five months even without charges being brought against them,? he said, adding action should have taken against these officers based on the civil law of the country instead.
	Five intelligence officers including two colonels had been detained in the last five months under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) in connection with the Ekneligoda disappearance.
	He charged that the government's decision to release ex-LTTE detainees was only to satisfy the Diaspora and the TNA. ?The government is releasing former LTTEers who had committed heinous crimes against the citizens of this country while arresting soldiers who had sacrificed their lives to protect the country,? he said.

People from various walks of life jogging on the ?workouts lane? at the Independence Square is a common sight. VIPs from Diyawanna are also often found among these regular joggers.?
The other day, two yahapalanaya purohitas were relaxing at the Independence Square after a bout of workouts when they saw a lone jogger on the lane. It did not take long for the twosome to identify the lone jogger: The eldest prince of the former royal family.
The two purohitas watched with mixed feelings the young one of the former royal family jogging all alone and recalled the days when the latter used to appear at the Independence Square for workouts with a large following. At that time his father was the uncrowned king of the country and the young and old alike were falling over each other to bask in the glow of the young man?s company.
?At that time, there were a lot of young and old eagerly waiting here for the arrival of the young man from the powerful family. They considered it a privilege to take up the rear when the privileged buck started his jog. Now that his father is no longer the ?king?, his regular following has just disappeared!? one purohita observed.
?If the family members led a simple and modest lifestyle without going in for pomp and vainglory and a large following at their beck and call, their father could be the uncrowned king he was, even today!? the other purohita remarked.?

Don't amend Penal Code: BBS
	
	The Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) today objected to the amending of the Criminal Justice Procedure Code and the Penal Code.
	BBS General Secretary Ven. Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thera said it would be bad for the country and the people if that were to happen.
	?These Acts if amended can be used as weapons to suppress people, politicians and national organisations in the country,? he said. ?These two amendments have been published in the Gazette notification on November 6. We have the right to stand against the move to amend the acts and we will not allow them to be passed in Parliament.?
	The government seeks to amendment the first schedule of the Code of Criminal Procedure and Section 291 C of the Penal Code to make provisions to punish those who use words or use signs or visible representation with the intention of causing, instigate or attempt to instigate acts of violence or religious, racial or communal disharmony or feelings of ill will or hostility between communities or among different classes of persons.
	Those found guilty to be sentenced to two years imprisonment.
	?If the Acts were amended every coconut tree could be used as gallows and every government school and institutions would turn into prisons,? the Thera said. ?We are urging the government to pass an Act to stop religious conversion, but little or nothing has been done in that direction.?

Eknaligoda probe won?t affect intelligence officers: Ruwan
	
State Minister for Defense, Ruwan Wijewardene today assured that the probe on the alleged abduction and killing of journalist Prageeth Eknaligoda would be carried out in a manner which would not affect any intelligence officers.
He gave this assurance in response to a question asked by opposition MP Jayantha Samaraweera in Parliament. The state minister said he had already spoken to the intelligence officers and they had informed him that they were not at all affected by any inquiries.
The state minister said several suspects arrested in connection with the case had been released while four security personnel were still in custody.
Mr. Samaraweera said the intelligence officers were frustrated with the probe on Eknaligoda. He said fate of this case would be similar to that of the Millennium City controversy where valuable information was leaked out to the LTTE.
Minister Wijewardene said the MP should not compare the Eknaligoda case with the Millennium City incident. (Yohan Perera)

SL ranked 73rd in Human Development Index
	
Sri Lanka has maintained its rank in the 'high human development category' at 73rd place according to the Human Development Report (HDR) 2015 released yesterday in Ethiopia by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).
According to the Human Development Index (HDI), Sri Lanka had gradually improved in human development reaching 0.757 in 2014 from 0.679 in 2000, the Government Information Department said quoting the HDR.
The world average in 2014 is 0.711 and South Asia averaged at 0.607.
Noting the positive relationship between work and human development, the HDR said most Sri Lankan workers in the formal sector retire in their 60s, and a relatively small fraction are employed part- or full-time. But casual workers and self-employed workers tend to keep their full-time jobs for many more years.
Sri Lanka has integrated human resources and employment strategies in its National Human Resources and Employment Strategy, which began in 2014, to reduce unemployment and create more work opportunities. In Sri Lanka annual job growth is 12 percent.
Sri Lanka's neighbor, India is ranked at 130th in the 'medium development' countries along with Bhutan at 132, Maldives at 104, Bangladesh ranked at 142. Under 'lower development' countries Nepal is ranked at 145 and Afghanistan at 174. Pakistan at 147.
The top five countries in rank order of HDI are Norway, Australia, Switzerland, Denmark and Netherlands, with no changes from 2014.
The Bottom five countries in rank order of HDI are Niger, Central African Republic, Eritrea, Chad and Burundi.

He stands up to his political boss to keep his chair!
	
When the yahapalanaya purohitas got new portfolios with new subjects at the last reshuffle, they asked the chairmen and directors (of statutory bodies) appointed by their predecessors to quit office.?
However, most of these political appointees emboldened by the weight thrown behind them by their previous political bosses stood pat in their posts.
Given this unexpected situation, the authorities concerned wanted to resolve the issue diplomatically. So they took steps to bring out a special gazette notification giving the new distribution of subjects and the statutory bodies assigned to the reshuffled Ministries.?
Meanwhile, a powerful purohita had told an unbending chairman of a State-owned undertaking to quit without waiting for the gazette notification that was to quash his appointment.?
However, this chairman was no pushover. He had challenged the purohita saying: ?I am in possession of a court order that says that political authorities cannot send us home at their whim and fancy. A certain political boss of a previous regime who removed a chairman like me had to pay compensation to the latter. If you make any move to remove me, I?ll take you to courts to claim damages??
This bold reply took the wind out of the purohita?s sails, they say.

His plan draws support from an unexpected quarter
	
A Senior Banda from the hills contested the last general poll on the Betel leaf ticket but lost mainly because the former strongman did not pull his weight in his favour, they say. ?However, his new mentor raised him to Purohita status after offering him a gratis seat in Diyawanna.
Now this worthy has set his heart on an ambitious plan: To form a Betel leaf-led government in the near future. He has already begun winning over new members to the group which is to take over the reins after the expected change in the power equation in the House.?
However, the response to the overtures made to the members of the so called ?joint opposition? is not encouraging so far. The reason, they say, is that these members hesitate to throw in their lot with a scheme of things which has no place for the former strongman.
By the way, the green party stalwarts have got wind of this plan mooted by Senior Banda, but it has caused them no concern. ?We are not worried because it is going to be a flop,? a Green stalwart said.
The funniest part of this affair is that Senior Banda has won the support for his plan from a one-time leadership-level Blue party high-up, who was the target of his vitriolic abuse at the January 8 big poll. ?There are no permanent friends or enemies in politics!? Senior Banda told a colleague who expressed his surprise. ?This is a hackneyed saying, but it is true,? he added. ? ? ?

Reaffirming its commitment towards the development of the dairy industry and the development of rural livelihoods, Hatton National Bank (HNB) has joined hands with Richlife Dairies Limited to grant loans to farmers in the Kalutara District.
To mark the beginning of this partnership, 20 farmers engaged in dairy products collecting centres of Richlife Dairies in Panadura, Bandaragama and Wadduwa were granted loans of up to Rs.25 million recently. The scheme enables farmers to purchase cows and grass land in addition to equipment related to milk processing, milk production and other milk-related products such as yoghurt and curd. Furthermore, it facilitates the construction of cattle sheds, the proper transportation of milk and the storage of milk by providing the required chilling plants.
The loans were presented to the farmers at a function held recently in Bandaragama, Galanigama with HNB Assistant General Manager SME Jude Fernando as the chief guest. HNB was further represented by Senior Manager Development Banking Vishwa Gunawardena and Regional Head South Western Region Dammika Dissanayake while Richlife was represented Operational Manager Parakrama Weerasekara.
This initiative to develop the dairy industry is being worked off under HNB?s broader ?Agro Livestock Development Loan Scheme?, which was introduced especially for small-scale dairy farmers and large-scale milk processors. Since then the bank has demonstrated an unwavering commitment towards the promotion of the dairy industry, with the primary objective of enhancing the milk production and utilization of milk in Sri Lanka.
HNB has been a pioneer among private sector banks in terms of development banking and the Bank?s Development Banking Division, established in the late 1970s, accommodates SMEs, agriculture and microfinancing. HNB was Sri Lanka?s first commercial bank to employ trained technical and agricultural staff. The bank has been a participating ?credit Institution in ?credit lines financed by the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, International Fund for Agricultural Development, Japanese Bank for International Cooperation as well as the concessionary credit lines introduced by the Sri Lankan government.

NFF calls on people to oppose amendments
	
	The Code of Criminal Procedure and Penal Code amendments proposed by the government to ban hate speeches would only intensify disharmony amongst different ethnic and religious groups, National Freedom Front (NFF) National Organiser MP Jayantha Samaraweera charged today.
	The government on Saturday proposed the amendment of section 291c of the Penal Code which aims to punish those who use words, signs or visible representation with the intention of causing, instigating or attempting to instigate acts of violence or promotes religious, racial or communal disharmony or feelings of ill will or hostility between communities or different classes of persons.
	Accordingly, anyone found guilty of causing religious, racial or communal disharmony would be liable to serve a two-year jail term.
	MP Samaraweera warned that this interpretation could open the door for anyone wishing to cause communal or religious disharmony, to do so, and that even the sounds of Buddhist, Hindu devotional songs or Christmas carols could be fair game for these individuals, who could claim those songs had created feelings of ill will in them.?Laws banning hate speeches and the promotion of communal disharmony already exist. We have already established reconcilliation in the country. There is no need to bring in new laws as they will create more barriers among religious and ethnic groups,? he told a news conference held at the party headquarters in Battaramulla.
	He said western and Indian imperialist forces were behind the move to amend the penal code in order to tame those who want to rise up against them. He said the move could not be left ignored and that it would put restrictions on patriotic movements and their activities.?We request all religious leaders to express their opinion against the Penal Code amendments. We will take all measures possible to prevent these amendments from being enacted in Parliament,? he said.
	The government intend to discuss the amendments to the Penal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure on January 8 in Parliament and thereafter pass them into law, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Sampath Bank, a forerunner in ensuring the wellbeing of the country and its citizens, has been recognized as the ?Overall Best Corporate Citizen? of 2015 at the Best Corporate Citizen Sustainability Awards presented by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce.
This award assesses the unsurpassed sustainability practices adopted by corporate entities in Sri Lanka and recognizes corporate entities that create an immensely positive impact to the triple bottom line, which envelopes the environment, society and economy, whilst engaging in its main business.?
?To be recognized as the Best Corporate Citizen is first and foremost greatly humbling, as for Sampath Bank, contributing to the society in which we operate is of great importance. As much as we focus on our line of business, our commitment to social responsibility is driven by the bank?s heartfelt belief that the contribution towards the people, planet and economy remains the foundation of our strategy for long-term value and corporate growth,? said Sampath Bank PLC Pillar Head of CSR and Deputy General Manager Marketing and Business Development Tharaka Ranwala.?
Before offering a meaningful insight to Sampath Bank?s commitment to the triple bottom line, Ranwala stated, ?The bank?s higher state of excellence is governed under the triple bottom line which Sampath Bank focuses on as a clear strategy to achieve long-term sustainability. As much as we do our business and have corporate growth and profitability in our fore front, we believe the long-term sustainability of the bank also lies on how we remain focused on the triple bottom line.??
With that being said, Ranwala highlighted the many actions and initiatives which echoed the bank?s commitment to the principles of the triple bottom line and also depicted its commitment to ensure overall sustainability.?
Starting off with the environment, Ranwala explained that despite the minimal impact caused to the environment due to the nature of the banking business, the bank is profoundly committed to safeguarding the environs in the sphere the business is conducted.?
From adhering to environmental credentials to adhering to a voluntary code of ethics inclusive of Sampath Bank?s six Eco Guidelines and Environment pledge, Ranwala brought to light the initiatives carried out by the bank?s very own Sampath Nature Protection Club (SNaPC) founded with the mission to protect and conserve the environment. One of which is the Coral Restoration Project designed to maintain the rich biodiversity and marine eco-systems surrounding the coral reef located off the coast of the Polhena beach.?
Furthermore, while the bank introduces energy efficient solutions and advocates actions that save natural resources, Ranwala also pointed out the bank?s drive to develop environmentally conscious employees by conducting a community based initiative by SNaPC known as Outstanding Eco Teams, a competition that encourages employees to think green.?
Bringing focus to social sustainability and the people of the country, Ranwala emphasized on the bank?s commitment to create values for stakeholders including employees, customers and society as a whole.?
?In order to present the future to the people of the country, we believe the citizens need to have the suitable surroundings focused on by corporates such as ourselves, so that these individuals can swiftly move forward in life in the long run,? he added.
Sampath Bank?s commitment towards uplifting the wellbeing society can be noted in its Water Purification Project aimed to provide clean drinking water to the villagers of Poonewa and combat chronic kidney disease, and Sampath Pasala initiative driven to identify and develop schools in areas of basic infrastructure and uplifting the educational standards in rural areas of Sri Lanka. Ranwala also distinguished the bank?s dedication and efforts to gain and maintain customer loyalty through innovation and best practices and preserve employee trust through empowerment and encouragement.?
Furthermore, he also noted the proactive actions taken by Sampath Bank in order to meet the legal and regulatory requirements with respect to all aspects of the business.?

?She is upset over the court case??
	
The former strongman hosted all Diyawanna members, who did not vote for the 2016 Budget at its second reading, to a grand dinner in the city.
There were a few absentees at the dinner. Some of them happened to be away from the island. Most of these absentees had expressed regrets about their inability to attend.
Meanwhile, a fair member from the South who had made herself scarce at the vote taking, had failed to turn up for the dinner too. She had not expressed her regrets to the host either.
Her absence was a topic for discussion among some members at the dinner. ?There is a reason for her absence,? a member had said. ?She is upset over the court case. Some opposition heavyweights had promised to sort out the problem for her, but so far nothing concrete has been done in this regard.? Later some attendees had asked the former strongman not to take the fair member?s absence at the dinner seriously given her present frame of mind.

SL will be an example to rest of the world-US Envoy
	
The efforts taken by Sri Lanka to successfully rebuild the country and to reconcile its people would set an example to the rest of the world which is burdened with conflict today, visiting US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs-Designate Thomas Shannon said today.
?? What happens in Sri Lanka is of global consequence.? United States is proud to be a partner in the effort taken by Sri Lanka and proud to be an ally of Sri Lanka,? he said commenting on the United State assistance extended to Sri Lanka to develop the Eastern Province.
He said the US was also partnering to help conflict-affected families resettle in their communities which include a wide range of services, from shelters to sanitation to schools.
?
?It?s been a long road, and there is still far to travel. But the United States will steadfastly support Sri Lankans as they continue on their historic journey towards prosperity, peace, and reconciliation. Together, we can build better lives and create better futures for the people of both our nations,? Mr. Shannon said.
Though he is being in Sri Lanka for less than two days, he said it?s been so exciting to witness first-hand the important work that communities, civil society organizations, and local authorities across the island are undertaking to improve the living standards of Sri Lankans. ?
?I am impressed by the progress your country has made, both economically and socially. And the United States is so proud to work with you and help support that progress.? For nearly 60 years, US development assistance has invested in the people of Sri Lanka, in their communities, and in the relationship between our two nations,? he said.
USAID?s disability programs also help people get access to high quality rehabilitation services, so that they can do the everyday activities that so many of us take for granted, he said adding the US will continue their support to communities in the East, currently worth more than 3.2 billion Sri Lankan rupees ($23 million). ?
?We are supporting programs that bring together Tamil, Sinhalese, and Muslim youth on the sports field.? And we are providing them with English language and entrepreneurship training, as well as opportunities for exchange programs, and ways to address issues like gender-based violence,? he said.
He said the US was also working with partners in the East to help demining.? ?We?re moving toward a future where a farmer can till a field and a child can play cricket without any fear of losing a limb, or worse, to a hidden land mine,? he said.
Meanwhile, he said as honored as he was to be nominated to be the next Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, he may want to stay in Sri Lanka.

Story behind two crocodile figures!
	
The Nilwala gate at the southernmost entry point to the Southern Super-highway is, no doubt, a familiar sight for the users of this highway.?
Construction work of the gate over, the wisdom of fixing life-like images of two crocodiles on either side of the Nilwala gate dawned on the Highway Ministry authorities, though ?a bit late in the day. ?The idea was to symbolize the crocodiles the Nilwala River was infested with.?
In a rush these authorities got a foreign company to build two crocodile figures at a cost of several millions of rupees. Soon two crocodile figures were ready for installation on either end of the gate and they sought the advice of engineers for this exercise. A team of engineers who put their thick heads together about the impending task announced in one voice that the two metal crocodile figures were too heavy to be mounted on the gate and it would surely crash under their weight!
So the massive amount spent in foreign exchange on the construction of the two crocodile figures went down the drain!
The authorities soon realized that they would be in a fix if this failed affair went public. And they decided on a ploy that could bail them out. ?They got the engineers to mount the two crocodile figures on two hillocks on either side of the Nilwala gate to convey the impression to all and sundry that it was their plan right from the start. ?
The true story behind the crocodile figures is privy not only to the high ups, but also the small fry in the Highway Ministry, they say.?

Their precious vote produces the second ship owner
	
A rumour abuzz in political circles says that a yahapalanaya purohita has floated a shipping company from foreign shores. He is a party leader who is clever at boosting his political fortunes by allying with whatever government in power at the opportune moment.
?The company, according to informed ones is registered in a developed country in East Asia and the few ships it owns are already plying in international waters. ??
?Now many would ask how this politico had raised enough money to launch a shipping line. The answer is not far to seek. The high office he had held in two previous governments was a veritable gold mine,? a political source explained.?
He added, ?While on the subject of shipping business, earlier we could talk only about one politician ? a chief purohita ? raised to ship owner status by our voters. ?Now our voters despite a majority having to make a struggle to eke out a living can proudly declare that at least two of their representatives have become ship owners thanks to their precious vote.?

Two family regiments turn yahapalanaya upside down
	
People in the Kandy area have nowadays made it habit to refer to two family regiments ruling the roost in the Central Province. One regiment is described as the ?Elle? regiment and the other as the ?Wardana? regiment.?
Provincial Council employees say that of the two regiments, the ?Wardana? regiment is so bizarre; there cannot be anything that can be called its parallel anywhere in the world.
The ?Wardana? regiment is headed by a purohita whose success at a recent election was mainly due to his relentless campaigning on an anti-family bandism platform. Here is the front line of the ?Wardana? family regiment: The son, chairman of the biggest state-owned enterprise coming under the purview of the father. The daughter, General Manager of the enterprise headed by the son. Son-in-law, District Manager. So it is this family regiment tasked with the responsibility of handling the management and controlling the finances amounting to billions of rupees of the huge enterprise, operations of which are spread out in three districts!
The ?Elle? family regiment, though not as powerful as the ?Wardana? one, is said to be having its way and say in a great measure in the affairs of the portfolio held by the other purohita, they say.

## Title: Withdraw Penal Code Amend -TNA

Withdraw Penal Code Amend -TNA
	
	The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) has called for the withdrawal of the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill, placed on the Order Paper, citing that its provisions were identical to those of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), it is learnt.
	The government has decided to criminalize hate speech through the proposed legislation.
	The Bill seeks to introduce a new provision (Section 291C) to the Penal Code, No. 11 of 1887. A further Bill seeking to amend the Criminal Procedure Code Act, No. 15 of 1979 was also placed on the Order Paper.
	However, the TNA led by Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan said the proposed Section 291C was identical to Section 2(1)(h) of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act, No. 48 of 1979 (PTA).
	?The previous government used this very provision to target persons from the Tamil and Muslim communities and to deprive them of their freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution. We recall that Tamil journalist J.S. Tissainayagam was convicted by the High Court of Colombo and sentenced to 20 years rigorous imprisonment under Section 2(1)(h) of the PTA. We also recall that Muslim politician Asath Salley was arrested and detained under Section 2(1)(h) of the PTA. Both these persons were critical of the previous government?s policies, particularly with respect to the treatment of minority communities. These incidents and others like them prompted international condemnation of the previous government?s use of the PTA to suppress media freedom and dissent," the TNA said. We therefore wish to state that we strongly oppose the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill on the grounds that it is inconsistent with Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution, which guarantees to every citizen the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression including publication." (Kelum Bandara)
