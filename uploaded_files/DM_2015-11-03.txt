A picnic that ended in disaster!
	
This former army commander is now serving as our envoy in a Latin American country. This is a rich country. But the roads in this country are not safe for travellers due to the ever present threat from highwaymen.
Recently this envoy took time off his onerous duties to go on a picnic by car in the host country. He was accompanied only by his cook and one bodyguard. However, he failed to observe the protocol of informing either the government of the host country or the foreign ministry authorities here about his outing programme.
It was lunch time and the travellers now on a lonely stretch of road broke journey to have the picnic meal at a wayside spot. The envoy uncorked a bottle while the cook started preparing the meal. Alas! The diplomat had taken only a shot or two from the bottle when two gun-toting highway robbers descended on them. The two robbers soon cleaned them out of their money, gold and other valuables at gunpoint and proceeded to beat them up. What was worse, they made their getaway in the envoys car! The bodyguard escaped the beating as he had bolted the moment the robbers appeared.
The diplomat who once issued orders to the three armed forces in his country thus left high and dry on the lonely road had to trek about 20 kilometers to reach the nearest town from where he contacted his embassy officials to apprise them of his plight. The officials had immediately sent a vehicle to pick up the stranded envoy, his driver and cook.
The host government has already reported the envoys act of indiscretion to the authorities here, they say.

Veteran actor Lal Weerasinghe today reported to PRECIFAC to record a statement on a matter connected to SriLankan airlines.
He said he was asked to report to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry appointed to Investigate Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State resources, and Privileges (PRECIFAC) to obtain a statement about an event he had participated in.
I was only asked to give evidence about the event I participated in. I was told that the Commission was investigating an allegation against SriLankan airlines but that there was no allegation against me. I dont know anything about this matter, Mr. Weerasinghe said.
Actress and former MP Upeksha Swarnamalee (Paba), veteran artiste Bandula Wijeweera and actor Ruwanthi Mangala were also summoned by the Commission last Thursday in connection with this matter.

Amorous politico is a pain in her neck!
	
A love-sick Ministerial one hailing from the Uva has become a pain in the neck of a fair Diyawanna member from the hills, they say.
The Ministerial one, they say, has made it a habit to follow this fair member like Marys little lamb. He is ever on the lookout for an opportunity to greet her and hold her hand while expressing his pleasure at meeting her, a Diyawanna source said. The fair member has by body language conveyed the message that his amorous advances are not welcome. But the thick-skinned fellow keeps on annoying her, they say.

Et tu Brute
	
This former Betel leaf party Diyawanna member from a district in the West was in the habit of genuflecting to the deposed strongman when the latter was the monarch of all he surveyed.
However, the strongman wise to the politicos true colours did not offer him any position of authority and kept him at arms length. Once he tried all tricks in his bag to secure the chair of a state-owned enterprise without success. He contested the last general poll and suffered an ignominious defeat.
Soon after the general poll, the politico switched his allegiance to the new Big Boss and made it to the Diyawanna through the national list, thanks to the latters sympathy. He later begged for some position and was given a responsibility that enabled him to have a say about Diyawanna council affairs. 
Meanwhile, the new Big Boss received a written request from his predecessor now reduced to back bencher status that he be allotted an office room at the Diyawanna complex.
The new Big Boss later met a select group of seniors to discuss his predecessors request. The majority of seniors present at this powwow were for granting with this request. However, the member now having a say about the Diyawanna council affairs was up in arms against allotting an office room to his one-time patron. How can we give him an office at the complex He is an ordinary member now. If we acceded to his request, all other members too could claim an office room each, he argued.

The story about a massive amount of money in US dollars being held in a super bank account opened in an Arab country in the name of a son of a former VVIP continues to reverberate in political circles and the public domain.
The person who gave the tip off about this bank account to the authorities has reportedly affirmed in writing that this treasure is a gift offered to the VVIPs son by a former head of an Arab nation. 
The Arab benefactor who once was looked on as the most powerful and charismatic head of state in the Arab world had handed over the monetary gift neatly packed in several bags, according to the informant. This Arab leader, in fact, came to a tragic end a few years ago.

HNB General Insurance produces short film on dangers of texting while driving
	
		 		 
		 
			
HNB General Insurance, a subsidiary of HNB Assurance, initiated an awareness campaign that relates to the main reasons for road accidents in Sri Lanka. The company produced a short film It Can Wait, which is Sri Lankas first-ever public service announcement (PSA)-based English short film.
It Can Wait was directed by debut filmmaker Shaveen Bandaranayake who aimed to foster a culture of PSA within the local media fraternity and incorporate it within the strategic communications of companies.

With an increasing amount of road accidents, a seemingly unnoticed and unavoidable factor has been that of texting while driving. With this premise in mind, It Can Wait aims to communicate the importance of paying attention to the road and not the phone while driving, by showing the adverse aftermath of a life lost.
Commenting on this, HNB Assurance Head of Marketing Dilshan Perera stated, As a responsible insurance provider, we wanted to give a clear message to the public by portraying the importance of safe driving and the impact that texting while driving has on you and the people around you; this is a powerful message we wanted to put across via social media. We initially posted the trailer on social media platforms such as Facebook, YouTube and will be uploading on other social media platforms and in chosen cinema halls around the country. Having received an overwhelming response for the trailer, which was launched online recently, It Can Wait is set to premiere before the end of the month online and in theatrical format.
Speaking on the ultimate goal of such a project, Bandaranayake noted, Its a seldom spoken about topic in Sri Lanka and being a developing country, one that we need to start talking about. However, this is not the only social issue that deserves attention. I believe more organisations need to step up and utilise this format to educate the public.
It Can Wait was globally recognized, when it was screened at the 23rd Raindance Film Festival, UK, in September. The short film about texting and driving was an Official Selection for the Raindance Film Festival in the UK.

No permanent friends in politics!
	
The Western Province Chief Ministerial one was engaged in a serious political discussion with his party colleagues the other day on how they could secure a victory at the upcoming local polls.
The Chief Ministerial one called upon the participants to come up with their proposals to be considered in working out a polls winning strategy. Practically all former heads of local bodies and provincial councillors present expressed the view that they would find it difficult to make a good showing at the polls unless they campaigned under the leadership of the former strongman. In response to their collective opinion, the Chief Ministerial one drew their attention to a head of a local body looking after a maritime stretch South of the city. You all know this colleague, he continued pointing his finger at the particular local politico. He is well known in the country as a faithful follower of our former strongman. Now you listen to him and after that decide whether we need the backing of the former Big Boss to win the upcoming polls  
Taking the cue from the Chief Ministerial one, the head of that council began addressing the gathering. I have been branded as a follower of the former Big Boss. Some claim that we cannot win polls without his weight behind us. I cannot subscribe to that idea Its a fallacy to say that. There! Now you heard what he had to say, interposed the Chief Ministerial one. He as a faithful golaya says that we can do without the support of the former Boss at the upcoming polls and that settles the issue. Now let us continue our discussion
A Betel leaf senior who was amazed at the U-turn made by the head of the local body, a one-time henchman of the former strongman quipped: There can be permanent enemies in politics. But surely there are no permanent friends in politics!

SL willing to have joint patrolling
	
	Sri Lanka Navys Commander Vice Admiral Ravindra C. Wijegunaratne yesterday expressed willingness to have joint patrolling with India to tackle the problem of alleged poaching by Indian (Tamil Nadu) fishermen in Sri Lankan waters.
	I have no objection, he told The Hindu in reply to a question. Every three months, the Navies of the two countries, along with Coast Guards of India and Sri Lanka, have been carrying out flag meetings. This is equivalent to joint patrolling, he explained.
	The issue was discussed in the past too but there had been no progress. In 2007 when the Eelam War was on, the Indian Navy had expressed its reservations over any move to carry out joint patrolling.
	An observer who has been studying the problem of fishermen says India should now agree to the idea.
	The revival of the idea comes in the wake of the latest arrest of six persons by the Sri Lankan authorities on Saturday night , taking the number of arrested persons to 126.
	During a debate in Sri Lankan Parliament in early October on the issue of alleged poaching, Leader of Opposition R. Sampanthan had suggested that apart from the Sri Lankan Navy patrolling the international boundary, the Indian Navy or the Indian Coast Guard should also join the exercise .
	A former Congress legislator of Tamil Nadu, who represented Ramanathapuram, K. Hasan Ali , during his recent visit to Colombo, also reiterated the proposal.
	The Commander also gave an account of the annual joint naval exercise by the two countries which concluded in Trincomalee on Sunday. The exercise, lasting six days, saw the participation of six vessels of Sri Lanka and three of India.
	
	The purpose was to equip the Navies of the two countries to respond swiftly to disaster or emergency, he added.
	As for the reported incident of damage caused allegedly by a group of Indian fishermen last week to the Sri Lankan Navys vessel, Vice Admiral Wijegunaratne said this took place when the fishermen were resisting arrest. This was why a complaint had been lodged with the police. It is now a legal matter, he said.
	However, he said the entire issue [of the release] will be sorted out today. The authorities, on getting appropriate advice from the office of Attorney General, would move the court concerned for securing the release of the fishermen.

A detractor of the new Big Boss, this politico recently had called on a well-known astrologer to get a reading of his political future. And the astrologer had predicted that he was destined to occupy the second highest chair in the country one day.
