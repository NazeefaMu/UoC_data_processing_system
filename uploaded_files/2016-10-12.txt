A secret missive from the palace sparks off speculation
	
?
A rumour doing the rounds in political circles says that a senior member of the yahapalanaya top team had visited a temple in Narahenpita for the specific purpose of delivering a secret missive from the ?palace?.
?
The missive from the ?palace? was intended to convey a message to the former strongman.?
The top team member hand-picked for this errand is a politico hailing from a gem-rich area who had been steadfast in the view that the two warring factions of the Blue party should unite letting bygones be bygones.?
According to this rumour, the missive had carried a reference to the rebel group being a stumbling block to the smooth running of yahapalanaya apart from a clear hint about a possible shake-up at the top that could lead to a solution acceptable to all. Meanwhile, some analysts cite the results of the recently held elections to co-operatives that gave a jolt to the yahapalanaya leadership is the immediate cause for sending the missive.

Cops with cases against them recruited to FCID: Namal
	
MP Namal Rajapaksa said today that the IGP should conduct an investigation to find out how police officers with outstanding cases against them were recruited to the FCID.
He said he had the names of the police officers in the FCID who had cases and corruption charges against them.
?The police officer who arrested me recently was out on bail in a murder case. I filed a case against the FCID demanding compensation. I will file more cases. This is just the beginning. We still have faith in the judiciary,? he said.
Mr. Rajapaksa asked why police officers with criminal charges against them were assigned to question politicians.
?The government is doing things contrary to the principles of good governance. Murders are rampant. The underworld has raised its head,? he said.
He said people neither respect nor fear the police and the judiciary as they had been politicized.
He said people were losing faith in the judiciary and the economy was collapsing. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Green party is set to weed out ?double dealers?
	
?
The Green party has identified several members of its Diyawanna group as ?double dealers? and the party?s whip is about to come down on them, they say.
?
The party hierarchy has received reports that some of them are in the habit of openly criticizing the party leadership.
Three to four from among the double dealers hailing from Galle, Polonnaruwa and Kalutara are already facing disciplinary action for undertaking foreign travel without the nod of the party leadership. ?Meanwhile, a top team member from Galle holding a key portfolio has already received a severe reprimand from the party.?
The Green party leadership has also initiated inquiries to check the veracity of reports that another four to five from the Diyawanna group from Ratnapura, Kurunegala and Matale are poised to get on board the double dealers? boat.
Later fearing a backlash, the purohita had left no stone unturned in his effort to prevent the print and electronic media going to town with the story, they say.

He gave the broth a miss to escape the peasant?s wrath
	
?
A purohita from the South recently set out on a visit to Rajarata on official business well ahead of the crack of dawn.?
?
The motorcade was cruising along the Puttalam-Anuradhapura road when the chief purohita began feeling the pangs of hunger. While watching out for a wayside tea kiosk to have some bites, the chief one spotted a ?kola-kenda? spot and asked his security guards?to stop.
The purohita and his escorts, who entered the booth, found a few peasants seated inside sipping the popular herbal broth. The ?kola-kenda? available for serving was hardly sufficient for the new crowd and the politico and his escorts had to wait for a fresh supply from a pot already boiling on the hearth. The politico was impatiently waiting for the broth, when a talkative one from among the peasants addressed him. ?How do you size up the current political situation, Sir??
?Yahapalanaya government is running smoothly!? the politico replied.
?Then, why is the pro-government groups lose at all elections to co-operatives. Didn?t your group lose at the election held in your own village?? ?the talkative one asked again.
Taken aback by this question, the purohita could not give an immediate reply.
And the talkative peasant continued to hold forth: ?Sir, high-ups in politics like you do not appear to feel the pulse of people like us. That accounts for your complacency.?
The peasant who appeared to be in his element proceeded with a commentary on the difficulties the ordinary people were going through. Irked by the critical remarks being made by the peasant, the politico decided that it was more conducive for his political health to leave the place immediately rather than get into an argument with the man. He addressed the kola-kenda booth owner. ?I have to rush to Anuradhapura to keep an appointment. So I am sorry that we have to miss your kola-kenda.??
And as he left the booth with his escorts to the waiting vehicle, the talkative peasant spoke up again: ?Sir, it?s a pity you can?t wait for kola-kenda. Please also remember, Sir, that we too cannot wait too long for solutions to our urgent problems.?

?
The chief purohita who arranged for a group of councilors to enjoy a holiday in Russia at public expense after pulling the wool over the eyes of the Big Boss and the governing one got a dressing-down from the ?palace? recently.?
?
The harangue from the palace that lasted for about 15 minutes had ended with the severe warning that any future move on his part involving the squandering of public funds would result in his wings being clipped.?
After receiving the warning call, the chief purohita had remained indoors for the rest of the day trying to recover from the shock.
Meanwhile, the group that left for Russia has returned home and the other group now sulking over the loss of their turn to go on the jaunt following the taboo slapped by the palace is said to be directing their ire at the chief purohita and the governing one in particular, they say.

JO wants Perpetual Treasuries sealed
	
The Joint Opposition today questioned whether the unclear manner, in which the Perpetual Treasuries Limited earned an excessive profit of Rs. 5 billion by trading Government Bonds, could fall under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.
Addressing a media briefing, Joint Opposition leader MP Dinesh Gunawardane claimed that Central Bank (CB) report on the controversial bond issue, had found that the source of earning a profit of Rs. 5 billion was unclear.
?It is suspicious in which manner the Perpetual Treasuries Limited earned an excessive profit. As the Joint Opposition, we would like to request an immediate declaration from the Government on this issue whether it could fall under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act,? he added.
He also said the Government should be taken immediate steps to seal the Perpetual Treasuries Limited.
Meanwhile, Joint Opposition member Prof. G.L. Peiris said Perpetual Treasuries Limited had made an after-tax profit of Rs.5.1 billion for the year ended in March 31, which was even more than an annual after-tax profit of a bank in Sri Lanka.
?The Government is expecting an income of Rs. 3 billion with the increase of Value added tax in this year. But this company earns more than what the Government expected from VAT increment by burdening the poor with excess taxes. Therefore, this company should be sealed as soon as possible,? he added.

However, the talkative lady who took over the task of organizing the big event had monopolized the entire face of the large poster with her mug shot making no reference even in small lettering to the other two JO stalwarts from the district Vasu and Ranji and the latter had complained to the former strongman about this discriminatory treatment to them.?
The angry duo had also queried from their Boss whether there was a move to appoint the lady from Ratnapura as the general secretary of the proposed new political party he was to lead.?

PM says would renegotiate GSP Plus
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today he would visit Brussels on Saturday to re-negotiate GSP Plus trade facility with the European Union.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said this at the World Export Development Forum 2016 organised by the Export Development Board (EDB) and International Trade Centre which got underway this morning.
?On Saturday I will be leaving for Brussels to re-negotiate GSP Plus, he said while stressing that Sri Lanka needed to find markets for its products in order to increase exports, which would enable growth.
?We had the GSP+, so did Bangladesh. We gave it up while Bangladesh kept quiet, and increased its exports on garments alone.
?We focused instead on foreign remittances. But that is limited as it brings a limited income from large number of people,? he said.
The Prime Minister said Sri Lanka would be working on several free trade agreements and also a comprehensive economic partnership with Japan, while the country was looking towards signing free trade agreements with Bay of Bengal countries.
?We have three important agreements -with India, the Economic Technological Cooperation (ETCA) agreement. It will enable us for closer cooperation with India, especially with the five Southern States, with Sri Lanka being the fastest growing area in the sub continent. At the moment there is a combined GDP of $ 500 billion. There is a lot of scope for Sri Lanka and India to work together,? he said.
He also said Sri Lanka would be working on another FTA with Singapore. The Prime Minister said Sri Lanka would negotiate on Free Trade Agreement with other Bay of Bengal countries as well.
?The Bay of Bengal will be a fast growing region with fast growing incomes,? he said.
He said Sri Lanka was currently talking with China on a Free Trade Agreement under One Gate, One Road initiative.
?This way we can reach for Asian markets and the European markets. The way USA will develop will be known after November, when the new regime takes over. But we have made the plans as far as markets are concerned,? he said.
He said a programme of giving incentives to the foreign direct investments and local investments would be announced shortly.
The Prime Minister said one core area that would be focused on would be to give incentives to domestic manufacturing industries to become competitive. (Yohan Perera)

President hits out
	
President Maithripala Sirisena expressed his extreme displeasure and disgust today at the dragging to court of the former defence secretary and three former commanders of the Navy, in a case filed by the Bribery Commission.
He said lawyers who appeared in the case had alleged that he was behind these actions. He said he did not know about them until later.
?I knew only that morning that there was such a case,? he said.
?There are objectives and a policy in establishing independent commissions. Those who are in these commissions should know their subject areas. Those who are not aware of national security, military administration and management are taking various wrong decisions without thinking,? he said.
President Sirisena said the top officials of the respective institutions had a right and a responsibility to inform him and the Defence Minister of these matters.
?Some people may say that it should not be so as these are independent commissions. Even though commissioners were appointed by the constitutional council, it is I, the President, who appoint the Chairman and the Director General of these commissions,? he said.
He expressed these views at a function, ?Sathviru Urumaya? held at the Foundation Institute to hand over the deeds of houses and lands to military officers.
He said if there was an issue with regard to the Defence Ministry and Avant Garde, there were a procedure and methodology to investigate it.
He said some people, including former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, took political advantage when they were taken to court.
?I was not elected President to intervene in judicial matters or influence independent commissions or pressure the Attorney General to release rapists. I was elected to carry out political reforms and uphold democracy, judicial independence and law and order. I will not surrender to anyone when meeting my responsibilities. I will not act to weaken the security forces nor allow others to do so,? he said.
Commenting on the remanding of some army intelligence officers in the Ekneligoda case, he said he had advised the relevant officials to take action against them if they had done wrong, grant them bail and hear the case -- or release them if they were not guilty.
?I did not talk about these matters in public earlier, but I have to do so now and take action,? he said.
He said that he had raised the matter at a special meeting with the Prime Minister and the Cabinet and pointed out that he would have to take action if the CID, FCID and Bribery Commission were acting according to some political agenda.
?These institutions cannot function according to a political agenda. The law should be the same for everyone. People allege that I was behind these things. I do not want to remand or imprison anyone. I want to tell you this today, if not I will be blamed,? he said.
He said his government had been able to mitigate the allegations of human rights violations and settle proposals for hybrid courts and international judges.
He said that, despite this, some were accusing him of betraying and weakening the security forces and destroying the country for his political advantage.
?Anyone can come and discuss these matters with me, ?he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

President orders separate probes into nightclub din
	
Concerned over the linking of his son Daham Sirisena?s name to the brawl allegedly took place at the ?Clique? Night Club at the Union Place early Saturday morning, President Maithripala Sirisena has instructed the Police Chief and the Director of the Presidential Security Division (PSD) to conduct two separate and thorough investigations, Cabinet Spokesman Acting Media and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Karunaratne Paranawithana said.
Responding to a journalist who raised the issue at the weekly Cabinet news briefing yesterday, Paranawithana said there were no evidence to point the finger at Daham, as suggested by some quarters, but President Sirisena was determined to go to the bottom of the incident to know what exactly had happened.
?No one has lodged a complaint against Daham and the bouncer of the Night Club, who has allegedly been beaten, had said he could not identify the persons who attacked him. Besides, the owner of the Night Club has also cleared Daham and the PSD from the incident,? he said.
Minister Paranawithana said the Government would not attempt to sweep this incident under the carpet and the entire country would get a clear picture as to what exactly happened at the Night Club after inquiries of the PSD and the Police

??What we are doing here is dealing with the aircraft orders placed by the previous management. In that process we have managed to save money by either terminating some of the orders or by selectively adding to the fleet appropriate aircraft based on the airlines? requirements,? the airline said in a statement.
Accordingly, the airline has already terminated the leases on four A350 aircraft and is currently negotiating with the Airbus on the status of four more similar aircraft scheduled for delivery from 2020 onwards.

The Sri Lanka Customs Department would facilitate thirty Government and private sector institutes to clear their imports without checking, Customs Spokesman Dharmasena Kahandawa said.
He said that the Customs Director General Chulananda Perera had made the decision in order to ease the clearance process and provide the facility to regular importers.
The decision was made following several meetings held earlier this week with the Customs higher management and the Customs Director General.
The meeting was also held with the importers during the previous week, where the facility was discussed and t he measures to obtain the facility were explained.
The facility would only be provided to regular importers, who do not have any black marks in their records through the Green Channel facility.
?We will look into the past records of the importers and only those who have no black marks in their records will be provided the facility,? he said.
However, the imports would be randomly scanned even though they were allowed the facility, he said.
?If those who are provided the facility are caught with illegal items, the Customs Department will not only check the entire stock of goods but would also take legal action and black list the said company,? he said.
?This will allow other importers to work towards import only legally permitted products,? Mr.Dharmasena said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
