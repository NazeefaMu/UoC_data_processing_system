A new twist on the old adage asking for a pound of flesh
	
A story was reported where an individual had requested his mistress to return back to him 250 grammes of dry-fish that he had bought for her among other items if she wanted him out of her life forever.
The man, who is 66 years old, was suspected by his mistress of having affairs with women other than herself. The mistress, a widow of 53, had changed her address to get away from the philandering boyfriend, but he had followed her to her new abode and wanted to reconnect. She however had suffered enough from his cheating ways and had gone to the police and lodged a complaint that her former boyfriend was bothering her and would not leave her alone.
The dejected lover had agreed but his condition to her for doing so was to ask that she returned everything that he had given her during their courtship including a broken bed, a stool, a kettle and the dry fish bought by him. However, even after she agreed to do so he wept at the police station saying he could not live without her.
Investigations were being carried out under the auspices of Chief Inspector Bandara of the Katugastota Police.(Mohammed Asik)

Election propaganda -- Don't misuse Temple Trees: CaFFE to PM's Secy.
	
The Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) today requested the Prime Minister's Secretary not to allow Temple Trees to be used for election propaganda work.
It said this in the wake of an event where the education ministry distributed mobile lab kits to school principals on Thursday.
In a statement CaFFE accused the Good Governance administration of using Temple Trees, which is the Prime Minister's office for election propaganda purposes and said the former Rajapaksa administration also did this.
The Ceylon Teachers Union (CTU) alleged that the Education ministry had distributed mobile lab kits at Temple Trees with the participation of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and and Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam.
CaFFE said the event was organised by Director of Education (Science), M.P. Vipulasena and that some 3,000 people had participated.
It said even the Rajapaksa administration had misused Temple Trees by hosting events in blatant violation of election laws and the abuse of state resources.
CaFFE said the present administration was also following the example set by the previous administration.
It is saddening to see that state officials have not learned a lesson from what befell Lalith Weeratunga and Anusha Palpita, it said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

## Title: Govt. borrowed USD 14.6 bn foreign currency loans: MR

Govt. borrowed USD 14.6 bn foreign currency loans: MR
	
The government has borrowed over USD 14.6 billion in foreign currency loans alone during the short period of 36 months that this government has been in power, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said today.
He said even though 14.6 billion USD would suffice to build five Norochcholai power plants, five Hambantota harbours with enough money being left over to build two more Southern Expressways, the yahapalana government had not built even a culvert with that money.
I have made reference so far only to foreign currency loans. From January 2015 to date, the yahapalana government has borrowed well over Rs. 5.7 trillion in Rupee loans as well, through the issue of treasury bills and treasury bonds, he said.
The yahapalana government has marked its third anniversary by claiming credit for projects for which money was allocated and started by the previous government, he said.
The full statement:
Third anniversary of the incompetent government responsible for the worst debt crisis in Sri Lankan history
On 9 January 2018, the so-called yahapalana government completes three years in office. During this short period they have created numerous crises running through virtually every sector in Sri Lanka. The main subject of public discussion today is the bond scam and the attempts being made by the yahapalana leaders to sweep it under the carpet. We are awaiting the release of the full report of the Bond Commission. The bond scam is only one of the many disasters brought upon this country by the yahapalana government. As this government marks its third anniversary, I wish to draw the attention of the public to another danger they have brought upon this country.
During the short period of 36 months that this government has been in power, they have borrowed over USD 14.6 billion in foreign currency loans alone, the breakdown of which would be as follows - USD 7.2 billion through the issue of Sri Lanka Development Bonds from January 2015 onwards, USD 3.6 billion from sovereign bonds issued in 2015 and 2017, USD 2.2 billion through currency swap arrangements with India in 2015 and 2016, USD 1.7 billionthrough syndicated loans arranged through several international banks in 2016 and 2017 and USD 1.5 billion from the IMF Extended Fund Facility in 2016. No previous government has borrowed so much money through foreign currency loans in such a short period of time.
Even though 14.6 billion USD would suffice to build five Norochcholai power plants, five Hambantotaharbours with enough money being left over to build two more Southern Expressways, the yahapalana government has not built even a culvert with that money. I have made reference so far only to foreign currency loans. From January 2015 to date, the yahapalana government has borrowed well over Rs. 5.7 trillion in Rupee loans as well, through the issue of treasury bills and treasury bonds.The government commissionedthe Moragahakanda project and opened the Rajagriya flyover to coincide with its third anniversary so as to answer the critics who say that the yahapalana government has not built anything tangible despite massive foreign borrowings. However, the Moragahakanda project was planned, financial allocations were made and construction commended under my government way back in 2007 in accordance with the 2005 MahindaChintanaprogramme. Likewise the Rajagiriya flyover was planned and money was allocated for its construction by my government. Cabinet approval was granted to call for bids to select contractors for the construction of the flyovers in Rajagiriya, Polgahawela and Ganemullaat the cabinet meeting held on 4 December 2014.
The yahapalana government has marked its third anniversary by claiming credit for projects for which money was allocated and started by the previous government. They came into power in 2015 claiming that there was a debt crisis in the country due to the loans taken by my government to build power plants, harbours, airports, expressways etcetera. However the total cost of these major development projects were as follows: USD 1,350 million for all three phases of the Norochcholai power plant; USD 740 million for the Southern Expressway from Kottawa to Matara; USD 1,300 for phases I and II of the Hambantotaharbour and its bunkering facility; USD 292 million for the Colombo-Katunayake expressway and USD 209 for the Mattala airport.
All these development projects put together cost less than USD 3.9 billion. The claim that the present government has been forced to borrow heavily to repay the project loans taken by my government is a complete lie. With the 14.6 billion USD in foreign currency loans that this government has borrowed up to now, the loans taken for all the above mentioned development projects could have been repaid four times over.The debtnow being incurred is used to meet the day to day expenses of the yahapalana government and not to repay the project loans taken by my government. From January 2015, there was a massive and unplanned increase in government expenditure as a result of state funds being utilized to meet political objectives. The present debt crisis came about due to the yahapalana government borrowing heavily in Rupees and in foreign currency in order to meet this increased expenditure.
Foreign currency loans should always be taken with the utmost care. Since it is necessary to purchase foreign currency to repay such loans, even a slight change in the exchange rate can give rise to a massive increase in a countrys indebtedness. According to the 2015 and 2016 Central Bank reports, due to the depreciation in the value of the Rupee as a result of the economic downturn that took place after the yahapalana government took office, an extra Rs. 478 billion has been added to the national debt. It should be noted that the increase in the interest rate by about 50% due to the bond scam, has also added to the debt burden.
My government was always very careful in taking foreign currency loans. According to the Finance Ministry, the repayment of foreign loan installments plus interest during the period 2008-2014 was as follows:
2008  USD 881 million
2009  USD 1,041 million
2010  USD 826 million
2011  USD 971 million
2012  USD 1,620 million
2013  USD 1,160 million
2014  USD 1,306 million
Since these are not unmanageable amounts, my government never had a problem with foreign loan repayments. The present crisis is entirely a creation of the yahapalana government. The foreign loan instalments and interest thereon that have to be paid after 2015 is as follows:
2015 - USD 1,828 million
2016  USD 1,604 million
2017 - USD 2,132 million
2018 - USD 2,891 million
2019 - USD 4,217 million
2020 - USD 3,699 million
2021 - USD 3,344 million
2022 - USD 3,743 million
2023 - USD 2,120 million
2024 - USD 2,067 million
2025 - USD 4,155 million
2026  USD 2,758 million
2027  USD 3,448 million
These figures amply explain the difference before and after the change of government in 2015. The immediate increase in repayments from 2015 onwards is due to the huge short term commercial loans taken by the yahapalana government to be repaid in a few months or one or two years. What Sri Lanka experienced in 2015 was a borrowing frenzy. Central Bank records indicate that before the yahapalana government came into power, Sri Lanka Development Bonds were issued only twice a year with the amount borrowed per year not averaging even USD 350 million between 2010 and 2014. It should be borne in mind that this was at the height of the biggest infrastructure building programme in recent history. But in the year 2015 without a single new infrastructure project being initiated, the yahapalana government issued Sri Lanka Development Bonds on no less than nine occasions. The number of SLDB issues made in 2016 were six, with four being made in 2017.
The government has now obtained cabinet approval to borrow a further USD 5 billion in foreign currency commercial loans in2018 as well. In order to repay these loans taken for consumption purposes, the government has increased the tax burden on the people to an unbearable level by increasing the VAT, vehicle import duties, commodity import taxes, various levies and fines and stamp duties etcetera. From April 2018 onwards, the government will commence a programme to bring virtually every adult in the country into the income tax net. 

Since the massive loans taken by the yahapalana government cannot be repaid simply by increasing taxes, they have now started selling off all available national assets ranging from government owned hotels to harbours, expressways to power plants. Though the government claims that the Hambantota port was sold off because the loan taken to build it could not be repaid, the proceeds of the sale have not been used to repay the project loan but is to be sent instead to the Treasury to be spent on consumption  which reveals the actual motive in selling off these assets. Since the Hambantotaharbour was built with long term loans at concessionary rates of interest, the government is in no hurry to repay the loan taken to build it.
However there is an urgent need to repay the short term foreign currency commercial loans taken by this government for consumption purposes even if the payment has to be made with the money realised through the sale ofnational assets. If such commitments are not met on time, Sri Lanka will get locked out of the international financial markets. I request all voters to use the opportunity that will come their way on 10 February to register their protest at the disaster brought upon the financial system of this country by this corrupt, incompetent government.

Govt. directs transfer of officers to avoid conflict of interest
	
The government has directed all Divisional Secretaries to transfer with immediate effect any Samurdhi Officer, Agricultural Officer or Development Officer out of their divisions of duty if any close family member of these officers are contesting the local government elections in the respective areas.
There are about 100, 000 employed in these services. If a father, mother or any other close relative is contesting the local government elections in their areas of duty they should be transferred out of these areas, according to the directions given to the divisional secretaries.
Commenting on these instruction to the divisional secretaries JO Parliamentarian Sisira Jayakody said such orders would breach human rights.
Reportedly there are relatives of such officers contesting the local government election but they often hold different political views and there disputes among these family members, the MP said.
As these instructions are unreasonable they have asked the President to revoke the transfer orders.(Dayaseeli Liyanage)

HSBC launches first ever Visa Cashback card in Sri Lanka
	
HSBC, continuously revolutionising the credit card industry for over two decades,has joined hands with Visa International to introduce Sri Lankas first ever Visa Platinum Cashback card.
This new credit card will extra-fy the benefits cardholders receive on their everyday spend when they make payments using the card at any supermarket or fuel station.
With more people preferring plastic over cash, the number of credit cards in circulation in Sri Lanka has hit an all-time high. Credit card transactions in everyday spend categories such as supermarket items and fuel are increasing rapidly year on year, showing double digit growth. Whilst customers do enjoy seasonal savings, which has become synonymous with credit cards across the board, there is a clear vacuum in the industry when it comes to offering a consistent proposition that customers can enjoy on their daily expenses anywhere in the country, all year round.
With the launch of the new HSBC Visa Platinum Cashback Card, HSBC, in their continuous efforts to offer customers with what is relevant for them, offers 10 percent cashback on supermarket items and fuel island-wide, anytime on any day. A game changer without a doubt, the new card will consolidate all spend into a single platform to reward HSBCs frequent customers across all major players in the modern trade including all Keells Super outlets, Cargills Food City, Arpico Super Centre, Lanka Sathosa and Laugfs Sunup Supermarkets and all fuel stations managed by Lanka IOC, Laugfs and Ceypetco.
Whats more, customers will be entitled to cashback on all other spends up to 0.1 percent on total spend, coupled with discounts up to 50 percent at over 100local merchant outlets ranging from shopping and dining to hotel stays and travel, plus over 250 offers at merchant outlets world-wide with the banks Home and Away privilege programme. Cardholders can also enjoy attractive interest rates for their installment plans from as low as zero percent at over 500 merchant outlets or as a quick loan on their credit card account.
First time users who sign up and spend with their new HSBC Visa Platinum Cashback Card will receive an additional welcome offer up to Rs.5,000cashback upon spending Rs.25,000 within the first two months.
Commenting on the launch of the new card, HSBC Sri Lanka Retail Banking and Wealth Management Country Head Nadeesha Senaratne said: We continuously strive to get to know our customers better. As a result we understand what really matters to them, and that is why we have decided to launch this unique proposition to make everyday purchases using the HSBC Visa Platinum Cashback Card to be a rewarding experience. We have significantly invested in Bigdata to carefully analyse and understand our customers usage habits, trends and their likings. The new proposition is an outcome of data driven insights and listening to the voice of our customers. Given the larger relevance on selected categories and the attractiveness of extra-fy benefits, we are very confident that the new product will become the latest plastic money in your wallet this year.
HSBC also has taken this opportunity to unveil the new global plastic design with the iconic HSBC Lions, making it easily recognised anywhere in the world. They have been the symbol of the bank for nearly a century representing prosperity and protection while guarding the banks employees and its customers across the world. We have used the HSBC Lion on the card face to serve as a daily reminder of our promise to support our clients in achieving their ambitions, Nadeesha
further elaborated.
Visa is pleased to join hands with HSBC in presenting the HSBC Visa Cashback Card to its customers. With an increased rate of credit card penetration in Sri Lanka, we believe that the Sri Lankan consumer is ready to embrace new and value added services that give them extra benefits on their cards. In a market with changing dynamics, we understand that consumer expectations evolve with time; meeting those needs successfully remain vital to us at Visa, said Visa Sri Lanka Country Manager Anthony Watson.

President and I remain committed to ideals & vision that united us 3 yrs ago- PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, issuing a statement on the eve of the third anniversary of the presidential election victory of 2015, said there is much left to be done to bring justice for the sins of the past and heal this country from the culture of brutality that prevailed for nearly a decade.
He said in his statement,"Ours was a fight against unchecked corruption, against the re-engineering of the entire public service to serve the whims of a single family, and against the deadly white vans and death squads that aimed to cow the media into acquiescence.
When President Sirisena and I embarked on the campaign for Yahapalanaya on November 21, 2014, we were responding to a nationwide outcry to lift Sri Lanka out of the shackles of nepotism, and into the spotlight as a proud and independent member of the community of nations.
Our promise to the people was that should they elect us on January 8, 2015 to right the course of our country. We would rescue the economy, put an end to state-sponsored extra-judicial violence and restore the independence and respectability of our law enforcement and criminal justice systems. While our journey together has much more to accomplish, I am proud today to reflect on how many hurdles have been overcome so far.
In the three short years that we have been at the helm of the state, the unity government has implemented the 17th Amendment to the Constitution and given life to the Constitutional Council and independent commissions that allow the police, judiciary and public service at large to act according to their conscience and not the whims of their political masters of the day. We have passed legislation enshrining the right to information to all citizens and the right to assistance and protection for those of our citizens who are victims of crime or witnesses before the law. We have empowered the police, for the first time in the countrys history, to investigate and bring charges for complex financial crimes against the state.
The unity government has been at the forefront of these steps, making it a priority to take powers and privileges that were for so long hoarded by the executive branch, and indeed by a single family, and restore those powers to the independent arbiters of the people, where they rightfully belong in a transparent, secular liberal democracy.
One of the most heroic victims of this culture of brutality, Lasantha Wickrematunge, wrote in his last ever editorial of how it was the family of President Mahinda Rajapaksa that operated what he called the machinery of the state. His editorial, written in anticipation of his own murder, could not have been clearer: Now, it is clear to all who will see that that the machinery has operated so well that my sons and daughter do not themselves have a father.
Today, three years from the inception of the Unity government, also marks nine years from the date that Lasantha was killed. We vowed then, that his killers would face justice, as would the perpetrators of so many acts of violence perpetrated against media personnel in the dark days of the former regime. The government remains committed to this goal, which is an essential step in allowing the country to permanently rise out from under the threat of lawless rule by the sword.
I thank the people for placing their faith in us and in President Sirisena when they cast their votes on January 8, 2015, and assure them that both the President and I remain committed to the ideals and vision that united us then. Today, let us unite, not only in reflection of all we have accomplished together, but in appreciation of all that is left for us to do.

President hasnt used his sword well-  Gammanpila
	
President Maithripala Sirisena had not used his sword well to trap the real culprits of bond scam, General Secretary of Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU), MP Udaya Gammanpila said today.
Some party members of PHU including Udaya Gammanpila, Madumadawa Aravinda and Dammika Rathmale were seen today at the media briefing wearing clothes in black and carrying a sword in their hands.
Addressing a media briefing, he said if President Sirisena had used his sword well, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe would have been a convict of the bonds scam that took place in 2015.
Not only the Premier but also former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake should have been trapped for the bribery allegations and Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen would have been alleged for illegal deforestation. Still we see these crooks are at large. Thus, we insist the President to take instant actions against the said individuals and further look into the complaints that the Joint Opposition has made to the Bribery Commission under the 'Top-Ten thieves of the Yahapalanaya Government', MP Gammanpila said.
He further said President Sirisena must take steps to make the Bond report available for people to have access in all the three languages. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Price of packeted lunch goes up in Colombo
	
The prices of the packeted lunch sold within the Colombo City limits have shot up at least by 20 to 30 rupees from today following the increase of the lunch sheets and polythene bags from the beginning of the year.
When Daily Mirror carried out a study, it was revealed that the packeted meals and the night stall foods had been increased between Rs. 20 to 30.
When contacted, the sellers in the Colombo area said that the consumers had faced inconvenience due to the sudden price hike had impacted negatively their businesses.
However, they said they were left with no options instead of collecting the increased amount from consumers to recover the loss created by the price increase of polythene.
Meanwhile, the prices of all the meals other than the short eats had been increased in order to adjust the price increase of the polythene bags.
It was also learnt that some sellers declined to provide polythene bags as they were unable to bear the increased polythene prices.
Meanwhile, Speaking to Daily Mirror, Canteen Owners' Association Chairman Asela Sampath said around six million lunch sheets were being used per day within the Colombo to packet the meals..
He said due to the increase in the price of polythene, an additionall cost over Rs. 9.50 had to be spent to a packet of meals by the sellers.
Central Environment Authority Director of Waste Management Ajith Weerasundara commenting on the price increase said special raids had been initiated within the city limits from last Wednesday to nab the sellers using non-biodegradable polythene and lunch sheets.
However, he said during the raids the officers had observed that most of the sellers had complied with the use of the biodegradable polythene and lunch sheets as requested by the authority. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Some conspiring to destroy me for political survival: Ravi
	
UNP MP Ravi Karunanayake, who faces charges in connection with the Central Bank bond scam, asked for a copy of the commission report today under the Right to Information Act.
He told reporters that some stooges of political party leaders in the government and the opposition were conspiring to destroy him merely for their political survival.
The MP said President Maithripala Sirisena had not accused him of anything in the statement he read out.
"Dont try to create rifts between the President and the Prime Minister. A few people are working with ulterior motives. Government and opposition stooges are conspiring against me. I will not blame the President for this shadow boxing, he said.
When asked by journalists whether he was suggesting that no scam had taken place as mentioned in the commission report, the MP said he did not know about any accusation. I dont know about the accusations. Some who came from the national list are accusing me, he said.
The MP said 36 reports which were handed over to the President by PRECIFAC should also be revealed.
It has to be revealed as to who is responsible for the hedging deal which had caused a Rs 76 billion loss to the government. The government had lost Rs.7 billion from the Greek Bonds, Rs.146 billion from Srilankan airlines and the country caught in a huge debt trap. Those who are responsible for these scandals have not been uncovered though people are shouting about one deal. This is most unfair, the MP said. (Yohan Perera)

Will Tamil  film hero  Rajinikanth become Tamil Nadu  Chief Minister
	
I am not scared of entering politics; but I am scared of the media. Even big shots tremble with fear while facing the media, but I am still a baby, imagine how it is for me
I am not entering politics for money or fame. You have given that to me beyond my dreams, more than 1000 times and over. If I wanted political status, I could have taken the throne in 1996 itself. I declined it, saying I dont want it. When I did not desire power at 45, do you think I would, when I am 65
In the May 2014 Indian General elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Narendra Modi swept the poll in many states to form a government with a stable majority in New Delhi. However, Tamil Nadu was one of the few Indian states to resist Modimania with the Jayalalithaa Jayaram-led All-India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagham (AIADMK) getting 37 of 39 Lok Sabha seats allocated to the state.

Jayalalithaas resonating challenge at the Jayalalithaas resonating challenge at the 2014 hustings Modi or Lady resulted in the Lady routing Modi on her home turf. The BJP could not make headway in Tamil Nadu even during the 2016 Assembly polls. The AIADMK and chief opposition Dravida Munnetra Kazhagham (DMK) swept the polls.
The BJP was not the only National party of India that failed dismally in Tamil Nadu. Even the Congress party of the Gandhis and Nehrus which ruled in Tamil Nadu for 20 years after Independence from 1947 to 1967 has been unable to regain power in the South Indian state for the past 50 years. The Dravidian political ideology has been ruling the roost in Tamil Nadu. Either the DMK or its Alter Ego the AIADMK has been enjoying power in the state. Currently, the AIADMK is in the saddle though Jayalalithaa herself passed away in December 2016.
In a not so subtle bid to gain politically in Tamil Nadu, the BJP, currently, at the helm in New Delhi has been making several overtures to a popular Tamil film idol. 67-Year-old Rajinikanth or Superstar, as he is known who is still the single most popular mass figure among actors in Tamil cinema.
PM Narendra Modi paid a courtesy call to Rajinikanth when he visited Tamil Nadu for the polls campaign in 2014. Rajinikanth was invited as a special guest for Modis inauguration as PM the same year. BJPs Tamil Nadu state leader Dr.Thamizhisai Soundararajan has been calling on the actor several times. The lady doctor has even been cultivating the superstars spouse Latha Rajinikanth. The BJP has been trying very hard to entice him into its Saffron folds and utilise him as the vehicle to reach its destination of capturing state power in Tamil Nadu.
Interestingly enough Rajinikanth though the most popular actor in Tamil cinema is ethnically not a Tamil. He is not even a South Indian though born in Bangalore now known as Bengaluru. Rajinikanth is a Maratha whose family hails from Mavadi Kadepathar in the state of Maharashtra. His given name was Shivaji Rao Gaekwad. The Gaekwads are of Kshatriya warrior clan lineage. His family moved to Bangalore in the southern state of Karnataka during the British period. His father Ramoji Rao Gaekwad was a police constable. Rajinis given name at birth Shivaji Rao was derived from the legendary Maratha warrior-king  Chatrapathi Shivaji.
Shivaji Rao Gaekwad
Shivaji Rao Gaekwad was born in Bangalore on December 12, 1950. He dropped out of school after completing his secondary education (SSLC) and after engaged in several odd jobs, finally became a bus conductor. He began acting in Kannada stage-plays as a hobby and made quite an impression.
Encouraged by his colleagues and friends, he enrolled at the MGR Govt. Film and Television Training Institute in Madras (Chennai) in 1973 for a two-year course in acting. He passed out in 1975 and was soon provided a major break by renowned Tamil film director K. Balachander, who gave him three minor roles in three consecutive movies. Shivaji Rao renamed as Rajinikanth made his film debut playing a very small but significant role in Balachanders Abhoorva Raagangal (rare melodies) in 1975.
"His stock began to rise from 1980 onwards and very soon the ex-bus conductors movies began breaking box-office records. He was dubbed as the Super Star of Tamil cinema."

K. Balachander continued to give Rajinikanth roles in the Tamil and Telugu films directed by him. Other film makers too followed suit. In the early stages, Rajinikanth played somewhat negative roles. But gradually he began getting positive roles. Soon he started playing lead roles. Rajinikanth began captivating film goers with his smart appearance, stylish movements, novel mannerisms, rapid manner of dialogue delivery and a stirking penchant for uttering punchy one-liners. His stock began to rise from 1980 onwards and very soon the ex-bus conductors movies began breaking box-office records. He was dubbed as the Super Star of Tamil cinema.
Rajinikanth has in a career spanning more than four decades, acted in 165 movies.
Over a 100 of these were in Tamil but the dusky demi-god has acted in Hindi, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam movies as well. Rajinikanth has acted in one English movie titled Bloodstone. Most of his movies has been money spinner running to packed houses for weeks and weeks. He was arguably the highest paid actor in Indian filmdom and is reportedly paid over 500 million Indian rupees and a share of the profits for a film. Rajinikanth is married to Latha Rangachchaari, a Tamil Brahmin Iyengar woman. They have two daughters Aishwarya and Soundarya and three grandchildren.
Rajinikanth is a devout Hindu and a follower of the philosophy propounded by the miracle-working, scholarly Saint, Shree Ragavendhra Swami. Not only has Rajini named the wedding hall which he owns in Chennai as Ragavendhra Kalyana Mandapam but has also acted as the holy man in his 100th movie Sri Ragavendhrar released in 1985. Moreover, Rajinikanth has a custom of withdrawing frequently to the Himalayas and engaging in meditation.
He is also a devotee of Shree Sabarimalai Aiyappan hill temple in Kerala. He has never hesitated to speak publicly about his religious and spiritual beliefs. Also the actor endorsed the BJP-AIADMK combine in one election without joining party ranks. This, in turn, has created an impression - unfairly perhaps - that Rajinikanth is a kindred soul of the ultra-Hindu rightist Hindutva school of thought. The BJP, being a pro-Hindu political party, opposed to secularism perceives Rajinikanth as a fellow traveller and has been trying to make him a full-time party leader in Tamil Nadu.
BJPs political wooing
I have drawn attention to this prevailing state of affairs in an earlier column written for Daily Mirror in October 2014. In that article I referred to the BJPs political wooing of Rajinikanth explicitly and wrote thus:-
It is unclear as to what Rajinikanth will do because he has vacillated several times in the past on this issue (joining BJP). Regardless of what Rajinikanth may or may not do, what is of interest here is that even a national party reigning at the centre is being compelled to seek the services of a popular movie star to galvanise itself and capture political power in the state. This is due to the peculiar course of politics in Tamil Nadu, where the influence of cinema on politics has been of a phenomenal nature. Popular film personalities have enjoyed great support among the masses. The impact of cinema has been so great that one may very well quip that the way to a Tamil Nadu voters heart is through moving images on the screen. How this situation came about is a bizarrely unique story.
It is against this backdrop, that the BJP is now wooing Rajinikanth. Thus, the peculiar Tamil phenomenon of movie politics continues to dominate state politics and also impact on national politics as a whole. But with the dilution of Dravidian politics over the years, there is some expectation that the dominance of cinema in politics may get progressively weaker. This possibility, however, may be offset by the increasing Rajinikanth hype in the state. He is the reigning Tamil superstar, whose hold over the masses is reminiscent of that of MGRs.
He has a massive fan club behind him, which is exerting enormous pressure on him to enter active politics. At present, he has adopted a neutral stance, but may change his mind if enticed successfully. Unlike the earlier Dravidian film-star turned politicians, Rajinikanth has a spiritual streak in him and takes his religion seriously. Analysts predict that if he enters the fray, it may be on a Hindu nationalist platform, either in alliance with or as an integral part of the BJP.

"I cannot do it alone. All Tamil people have to come together and support me. I know it will not be easy to contest elections and win. It is like diving into the deep seas for pearls"
Given Rajinikanths current popularity and the continuing scenario of film stars dominating electoral politics, there is every likelihood that Tamil cinema will continue to hold sway over the regions political future. Rajinikanth, however, signifies more than a mere continuum. The bus conductor from Bangalore is a shining example of individual achievement. As the superstar himself said in one of his movies (Baba) he would be Late Aa Vandhalum latest Aa Varuvaen!(Even if I come late, I shall be the latest).
The above quoted paragraphs are excerpted from what I wrote in these columns in 2014 about Rajinikanth entering politics in Tamil Nadu.
However, after years of dilly-dallying, oodles of guessing games and perceived vacillation, the D-day for decision taking arrived at last. Rajinikanth announced his entry into politics and though somewhat late became the latest star to do so in Tamil Nadu.
Ragavendhra Kalyana Mandapam
Rajinikanth, has for some time, been inviting his fans in batches to Chennai and seeking their views on whether he should enter politics and whether he should form his own party or not. On the last day of the last year (Dec 31, 2017) office -bearer representatives of Rajinikanths fan club network were summoned for an important meeting at the wedding hall owned by the actor in TNagar, Chennai - Ragavendhra Kalyana Mandapam. While thousands of fans along with hordes of media personnel waited the magic moment with bated breath, Rajinikanth walked on stage clad in his customary white Kurta and Pajamas.
The hall reverberated with applause, cheers, whistles and shouts of Thalaivaa(Leader). Rajini started speaking and within a few minutes came the historic announcement dispelling all doubts; Naan Arasiyalukku Varuvathu Uruthi! (My entry into politics is certain).
Here are relevant excerpts from his announcement speech translated from Tamil into English.

"To those of you who are giving me life, people of Tamil Nadu, friends in the media, those who are watching me on TV, my love and wishes to you. First, I dont know how to praise my fans. anyone."
To those of you who are giving me life, people of Tamil Nadu, friends in the media, those who are watching me on TV, my love and wishes to you. First, I dont know how to praise my fans. All of you have been disciplined, without disturbing anyone. This discipline is enough, we can achieve anything.
I am not scared of entering politics; but I am scared of the media.
Even big shots tremble with fear while facing the media, but I am still a baby, imagine how it is for me Whenever I enter or leave my home, they shove their microphones and ask me questions. If I say anything, it becomes a debate.
Now, I will come to the point. Karmanye Vaadhika-raste, Maa Phaleshu Kadachana, Krishna told Arjuna in Kurukshetra (Mahabharata). You do your duty; I will take care of the rest. Go to war, if you win you will rule. If you die, you will die as a hero. If you dont go to war, they will call you a coward. I have already finished everything. I just have to shoot the arrow.
My entry to politics is certain
My entry into politics is certain. (Naan Arasiyalukku Varuvadhu Urudhi). This is the compulsion of the times. In the upcoming state assembly polls, I will start my own political party, and contest in all the 234 constituencies in Tamil Nadu. Before that, the local body elections will be held. But there isnt enough time, so we will not contest in that. As for Parliamentary elections, I will decide when the time comes.
I am not entering politics for money or fame. You have given that to me beyond my dreams, more than 1000 times and over. If I wanted political status, I could have taken the throne in 1996 itself. I declined it, saying I dont want it. When I did not desire power at 45, do you think I would, when I am 65 If I did, am I not a mad man Will I be eligible to call myself a spiritual person
"At this point, if I dont take decisive action, the guilt that I did not even attempt to do something good in a democratic manner for the people who have given me life, will haunt me till my death"
So, if not for political power, then for what else Politics has become very rotten. Democracy has decayed. The political events in Tamil Nadu in the past year have made every person hang his/her head in shame. People from every other state are laughing at us.
At this point, if I dont take decisive action, the guilt that I did not even attempt to do something good in a democratic manner for the people who have given me life, will haunt me till my death. It has to be changed, everything has to be changed. The time for political change has come. System has to be changed. We need truthful, honest, principled and transparent politics; not influenced by caste or religion. We need a spiritual politics (Aanmeeha Arasiyal). That is my goal, my desire and my aim.
I cannot do it alone. All Tamil people have to come together and support me. I know it will not be easy to contest elections and win. It is like diving into the deep seas for pearls. Only if we have the grace of God, the love, trust, respect and support of people, we can achieve this. I am fully confident that we will get the grace of God and the support of people.
In olden days, when Kings go to war and win, they plunder the coffers of the enemy. The commanders and soldiers will loot the people. Today, in the name of democracy people are being looted by politicians. They come to power and cheat people in several ways. Kings used to plunder foreign countries, here our politicians plunder our own country. This has to be changed, and it has to be changed democratically.
I want Kaavalarhal (protectors)
The party worker is the most important part of any party. It is the party worker who becomes an MLA or MP or CM. But I wont call them party workers. I dont want party workers (Katchi Thondargal); I want Kaavalarhal(protectors).
I want protectors who ensure that if we come to power, the people get what they are entitled to. I want protectors who do not go to MLA, MPs or officers out of self-interest. I want protectors who hold party workers, leaders and officers accountable, when we come to power.
"Ill be the peoples representative who will keep the protectors in check. Ill be the representative of the people, who will select the right person for the right position at the right time"

I will be the peoples representative who will keep the protectors in check. I will be the representative of the people, who will select the right person for the right position at the right time. We need an army or protectors for this, and we need to create it. I have several thousand fan clubs, in village and cities all across the state. The unregistered ones are twice as many. We need to get the unregistered clubs registered, and unite them all together.
This is an important task, and our first task.
This is not cinema, this is politics. It is not enough if we change; we need to bring others on board, including youngsters, women and children. Every corner of the state should have our club. This is our first task. Then we have to prepare for the democratic challenge with discipline and decorum. Till then, lets not talk politics, this includes me. Dont criticise other political leaders and parties until then. Dont get into political activism. There are others who are there for that. There are already people in the political lake, and they have to swim otherwise they will drown. We know how to swim, but lets not swim on the ground. When we get into the pond, we will swim.
We will prepare our Army, and right before the state elections, we will launch the party, tell the people our plan of action, tell them what we can do and what we cant, and if we cannot do what we promised, we will resign within 3 years. Truth, hard work and progress are our motto. My principle is to think good, speak good and do good, and good things will happen. Our army will be there in the next state assembly elections. Long Live Tamil Nadu, may the Tamil people progress. Jai Hind.
A unique feature of the relationship between the movie stars of the Indian south and their fans is the proliferation of fan clubs (Rasikar Mandrangal). These clubs would hold special poojas in temples whenever a new movie of their matinee idol was released. Milk would be poured on cut-outs of actors and camphor lit. The clubs held annual conventions and also participated in social service projects. Superstar Rajinikanth too has an enormous fan club network.
So huge was it that the super star stopped sanctioning and officially registering fan clubs since 1996-97. At that time there were over 50,000 fan clubs with a minimum membership of at least 25 each. Though Rajinikanth stopped sanctioning fan clubs since 1997, did not deter his fans from continuing to form fan clubs. This has resulted in thousands of unofficial Rajinikanth fan clubs with millions of members being set up in the past 20 years.
Rajini Mandram (Rajini Forum)
The official and unofficial fan clubs together comprise a formidable force. Rajinikanths first task after announcing his political entry has been the formal regularisation of these fan clubs both official and unofficial into one entity called Rajini Mandram (Rajini Forum). New entrants are invited to apply. Already the actor has a secretary and staff to coordinate his fan clubs. Now the staffs have been further enhanced and functions broad based.
A web site has been started in the name of Rajini Mandram to register members. It is said the new membership numbers have topped a million already.
Rajinikanth streamlining and developing his fan clubs into a single co-ordinated entity indicates that the superstar is emulating former Tamil Nadu chief minister MG Ramachandran (MGR) who transformed his fan clubs into party branches when he started his own political party. Rajinikanth is also going to transform his fan clubs into party branches when the time comes. He has not decided on a name for the envisaged party yet. It appears that the party logo would be a clenched fist with the fore finger and little finger thrust upwards. This is a famous gesture of Rajinikanth first introduced in the film Baba.
In the past, there have been many false alarms about Rajinikanth entering politics. In 2002, for instance, Rajinikanth acted in a film called Baba. The film story was narrated in a mode encouraging the political entry of Rajinikanth. A popular song Shakthi Kodu (Grant me strength) was sung by the playback singer Karthik while Rajini lip synched.
The song was a virtual political declaration. In that song Rajini sang that he would not waver once he had decided and that he would not step back after he had stepped forward. However Baba flopped and the actor flipped. He abandoned his proposed political entry. There was a lot of hoopla about the actor getting into politics then but everything petered out with the superstar backtracking. This time however things seem to be different. After years of indecision and procrastination, Rajinikanth seems to have decided finally to take the plunge into politics.
The first political party to hail the move was - quite unsurprisingly - the BJP. The BJP Central Govt state minister of Finance and Shipping from Tamil Nadu Pon. Radhakrishnan and BJP Tamil Nadu state leader Dr. (Ms) Thamizhisai Soundararajan issued statements welcoming Rajinikanths advent into active politics on Sunday Dec 31 itself. The Tamil Nadu BJP welcomed Rajinikanths decision to start a political party with State president of the party, Dr. Soundararajan, praising his aim of eradicating corruption in Tamil Nadu, through his political entry.
Aanmeeha Arasiyal(Spiritual Politics)
This was but natural as the ultra-right Hindu nationalist forces known as the Sangh Parivaar (Family of Associations/Groups) had been hoping for long to ride to power in Tamil Nadu by hitching the Hindutva wagon to the Rajinikanth star. The Hindu-right forces hoping to ride piggy back on Rajini are the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the allied Sangh Parivar comprising Hindu nationalist organizations like the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and the Hindu Munnani (HM).
The Hindutva movement hopes to absorb Rajinikanth into their ranks after the actor launches his party. The BJP is likely to align with Rajinikanths party in electoral politics first and then gradually draw him in further. The BJP is on the lookout for an acceptable new face to lead a joint front in Tamil Nadu and Rajinikanth with his Aanmeeha Arasiyal (spiritual politics) seems to fit the bill perfectly. Rajini clarified that he meant Honesty and Transparency devoid of caste and religion by the term Spiritual politics.
However not everyone from the BJP camp was elated over Rajinikanth. BJP maverick parliamentarian Dr. Subramanian Swamy had a different take on the matter. Speaking to the news agency ANI, Swamy said, He (Rajinikanth) has only announced that he is entering politics. He had no details or documents. He is illiterate. It is only media hype. The people of Tamil Nadu are intelligent. Dr. Swamy further added that he will expose Rajini. Speaking to reporters, he said, Rajini is an uneducated man. What will he tell us This is a just an age-old story of another Tamil actor joining politics. I will always oppose Rajinikanth.
Dr. Swamy added further This is a joke, Tamil Nadu requires something serious. The mood in Tamil Nadu is to get rid of all the film stars in politics. Rajini is entering politics at the wrong time and place. He should be worried, in fact that his entire black money trail will come into the limelight. The people of Tamil Nadu will not fall into Rajini fan clubs song and dance. Fans club cannot become a political outfit.
Subramanian Swamys derisive dismissal of Rajinikanths political future and his assertion that film star fan clubs cannot become a political outfit evokes a sense of Deja Vu. In 1972, the actor-politico MG Ramachandran known by the magic letters MGR broke away from the DMK which was ruling Tamil Nadu then. The Chief Minister at that time Mutthuvelar Karunanidhi was himself a drama actor, playwright and cinema script writer and lyricist.
M. G. Ramachandran (MGR)
As stated earlier, a unique feature of the relationship between the movie stars of the Indian south and their fans was the fan club network. MGR had been encouraging the phenomenon of MGR fan clubs from late 1940s onwards, and the clubs ended up as a well-knit federation that counted its membership in the millions. When MGR entered active politics, his fan clubs were in turn politicised and soon became an indispensable component of the DMK propaganda machine.
In MGRs case both spheres mutually reinforced each other - film popularity providing political mileage and political positions strengthening film popularity. It was not long before MGR was rewarded with political office. MGR was made first an Upper House member of the state legislature. Later he contested the State Assembly elections directly and won continuously in each election from 1967 to 1985 until his death in 1987.
The DMK first formed the administration in Madras state re-named by the party as Tamil Nadu in 1967. The popularity of MGR within the DMK party and Tamil Nadu state caused major convulsions. In a bid to counteract the phenomenon, the then CM Karunanidhi encouraged his son M.K. Muthu to enter movies. The father, while in office as CM, wrote the story and dialogue for Muthus first film Pillaiyo Pillai (Oh, What a Son) in 1972. Muthu fan clubs were set up overnight, with father Karunanidhis backing.
MGR, realising what was in store, engineered a split within the party in 1972 on the grounds of corruption charges against the incumbent DMK regime which he was part of. Incidentally, MGR did not have any problems in setting up new party structures - he merely converted his fan clubs into party branches. MGR formed the Anna-Dravida Munnetra Kazhagham (ADMK) after splitting from the DMK in 1972. He later amended it to All-India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagham (AIADMK).
MGR incurred much mirth among political pundits when he stated that his party ideology was a blend of capitalism, socialism and communism. MGR had the last laugh on his detractors when his party romped home as winners in 1977. MGR became Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. His followers who dubbed him earlier as Puratchi Nadigar or Revolutionary Actor now hailed him as Puratchy Thalaiver (Revolutionary Leader). MGR was elected Chief Minister again in 1980 and 1985 after his party won at the polls. He died in harness as Chief Minister in 1987.
Film industry Black Money
Given this successful MGR precedent, there is every chance that Dr. Subramanian Swamy may be proved wrong by Rajinikanth. As in the case of MGR, Rajini too is aiming to mount an anti-corruption campaign to cleanse public life in Tamil Nadu. The irony in this is that both MGR and Rajinikanth - as film actors - were/are part of systemic corruption in the state.
The film industry thrives on black money and actors get paid a nominal sum legally and large amounts of cash illegally. It is part of the film production system.
Therefore it is indeed ironic when actors who got rich on black money claim to clean up the system. MGRs rule eventually surpassed his predecessor Karunaidhis rule in Corruption. The corruption which prevailed under MGR paled into insignificance when compared to his successor Jayalalithaa Jayaram, who too was an ex-film artiste. Thus Rajinikanth professing to clean up Tamil Nadu and bring about a corruption free Tamil Nadu has to be taken not merely with a pinch of salt but a whole fistful.

"A main reason for Rajinikanths announcement now is that the political climate seems ripe for his entry. AIADMK supremo Jayalalithaa Jayaram has passed away and her party though ruling the state has fractured into four factions led by ex-CM O.S. "
A main reason for Rajinikanths announcement now is that the political climate seems ripe for his entry. AIADMK supremo Jayalalithaa Jayaram has passed away and her party though ruling the state has fractured into four factions led by ex-CM O.S. Panneerselvam, present CM Edappaadi Palaniswamy, Jayalalithaas Uyir Thozhi (life friend) Sasikala Natarajan (currently in jail) who was also appointed AIADMK interim General Secretary and Jayalalithaas niece Deepa Jayakumar. The BJP central govt has unified the Panneerselvam-Palaniswamy factions temporarily and is manipulating the AIADMK state govt like a puppet on a string.
The recent by-election at RK Nagar saw Sashikalas nephew TTV Dhinakaran contesting as an independent defeating both the AIADMK and DMK candidates. Its a fragile situation for the AIADMK administration in Tamil Nadu. CM Palaniswamys days are numbered.
The DMK too is not doing well. Party leader and former CM Karunanidhi, who is 94 years of age, and ailing and confined to a wheel chair. The one time powerful orator who has led the DMK from 1969 has lost his powers of speech. Karunanidhis son MK Stalin has donned the leadership mantle but there are strong doubts whether he can deliver. The recent RK Nagar by election was a shock to the DMK. It was expected that the DMK would win because the AIADMK votes were split among the official candidates and the dissident independent candidate. In spite of split votes, the independent candidate came first and AIADMK candidate second. DMK finished a poor third. Of course the cash for votes syndrome was rampant.
Attempts by smaller parties including the leftists to form a common front as a third alternative failed miserably at the 2016 polls. Casteist parties have a community vote bank but are unable to transcend those barriers. The BJP and Congress have again and again demonstrated that their national appeal does not work in Tamil land. Against that backdrop it could be surmised that a political leadership vacuum exists in the state. There is a need for change from 50 years of Dravidian politics. Rajinikanth with his millions of fans may very well step in and become a political force to be reckoned with.
Cinematic Chief Ministers
At least five persons connected to cinema have been Tamil Nadu Chief Ministers in the past. CN Annadurai and M. Karunanidhi wrote film scripts for films. MGR, his wife Janaki and paramour Jayalalithaa acted on screen. In that context, Rajinikanth in the future could become the sixth Tamil Nadu CM with a cinematic background. Nothing however is certain because actors like Sivaji Ganesan, Bhagyaraj, Ramarajan, Sarathkumar, Seeman and Vijaykanth could not become as successful as actors MGR and Jayalalithaa were in politics and reach the pinnacle.

"It is however too early to gauge the chances of Rajinikanth becoming the future CM of Tamil Nadu. He must form and register his political party and outline his principles and policies first"

There is also the fact that Rajinikanth is neither a Tamil nor a South Indian. The Keralite MGR grew up in Tamil Nadu and was active in politics for decades before forming a party and becoming CM. Besides Malayalam is a Dravidian language. Rajinikanth is a non-Dravidian Maratha whose origins are from the Maharashtra state and is one who grew up in Karnataka. Also Rajinikanth has not been engaging in active politics or public life as MGR did for years Rajinikanth moved to Tamil Nadu only to foster his film career. He is virtually a parachutist in the political milieu of Tamil Nadu. It is doubtful whether the outsider Rajinikanth with his brand of spiritual politics (Aanmeeha Arasiyal) will be welcomed by the more ethno-nationalist Tamils of the stare.
It is however too early to gauge the chances of Rajinikanth becoming the future CM of Tamil Nadu. He must form and register his political party and outline his principles and policies first. Furthermore it remains to be seen whether Rajinikanth will align himself with the BJP or not. Tamil nationalists and secularists fear that the Hindu ultra-right elements would utilise the spiritual politics of Rajinikanth as a Trojan horse to establish themselves in Dravidian Tamil Nadu. Even though Rajinikanth fans are ecstatic, there is likely to be strong backlash against the actor if and when he contests polls.
Influential Thalaiver(Leader)
Under these circumstances the question of whether Tamil Superstar Rajinikanth will become the CM of Tamil Nadu or not cannot be answered conclusively at this juncture. One certainty is that the entry of Rajinikanth into politics will electrify the political climate of Tamil Nadu. Whether he becomes CM or not, Shivaji Rao Gaekwad alias Rajinikanth will remain a significant and influential Thalaivar (Leader) in the Tamil Nadu political scene.
