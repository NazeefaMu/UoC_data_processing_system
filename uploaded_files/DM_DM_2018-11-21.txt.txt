A mission that went haywire
	

Two Diyawanna members, one from the North and the other from the upcountry estate domain had left their homes for Colombo on November 9 to carry out a mission which could have marked a landmark event in the countrys political history if it had succeeded, they say.

The Diyawanna member from the North in question was a character carrying a chip on his shoulder against his political party. The politico from the estate sector is an ambitious one always set to sail with the winds. However, a message the duo had received just on arrival in the city that the gazette notification dissolving the Parliament had reached the Government Printer brought their mission to naught, they say.

Anyone was welcome, but not him
	

It is obvious to everyone that that the new government formed by the Pohottuwa-Betel leaf alliance is faced with an uncertain future.

However, one may be surprised to hear that there was a scramble by dozens of politicos to jump on the new bandwagon.
The match-maker from the upcountry responsible for the new alliance had himself acted as the go-between for a gabby politico from the Western province. Well known as a harsh critic of the former strongman, this politico held top team status in both previous governments.
When the match-maker brought up the name of the gabby politico as one quite willing to throw in his lot with the new administration, the former strongman had gone livid. Suppressing his anger, he had told the match-maker that he would like to discuss the case with his close confidants before committing himself.
So, the match-maker had later mentioned the name of the willing pole-vaulter to the Pohottuwa front-liners. The mere mention of the name had sent the group into a rage. And they had given an earful to the match-maker for promoting the case of an arch-enemy of theirs.
Finding the situation was getting worse for him, the match-maker beat a hasty retreat, they say.

## Title: App-based taxi hailing cabs vs independently operating three wheelers

App-based taxi hailing cabs vs independently operating three wheelers
	
The advent of taxi hailing apps changed the way Sri Lankans access three wheelers and cabs. The average Sri Lankan mainly relies on three wheelers to get from one point to the other and long before the app based taxi hailing culture took root, three wheeler drivers had the final say in the rate for each ride. Those days the sight of a would be passenger haggling with a driver was a common sight. Three wheel meters which made an appearance sometime aftersomewhat evened the playing field for passengers. However, with the introduction of taxi hailing apps, the entire game changed. Recently, a group of three wheel drivers organized a protest against such apps, claiming that the playing field had once again acquired a slope to the disadvantage of unaffiliated drivers. Let us take a look at what is really going on.
Passengers
Recently, ITN aired a programme in which they talked to people from both sides of the spectrum. In the programme, passengers reveal that they still use a combination of choosing a metered three wheeler from a designated stand, hailing one off the road and using a taxi hailing app to book a three wheeler.
Passengers first and foremost seek a fair price along with safety. Out of the three wheel services available today, the random vehicles without a fixed meter charges passengers the highest rate. Even though, this type of service is rarely seen in Colombo or the major cities, once you venture further in, most three wheeler drivers still stick to the old method of dictating a price that they deem fit at any given moment. Three wheelers with working meters attached offer a fairer and a more manageable rate in comparison. The downside of this is that since most meters are not properly regulated, drivers can easily manipulate the meter and charge unsuspecting or hapless passengers exuberant rates. However, taxi hailing app based vehicles offer the lowest rate.
Safety conscious passengers invariably choose to rely on an app based taxi hiring systems as most platforms allow passengers the facility to track the driver and the route. As one of the passengers related, in case they leave behind personal belongings behind in the vehicle by accident, the tracking system acts as a life saver. Moreover, reliable and reputed app based taxi hailing companies hold their drivers accountable which allows passengers to travel without losing being overly anxious about their safety.
In good old Sri Lanka, reliability is a bonus. Generally and in the writers own experience app based taxi hailing services are reliable as they answer to a central entity.
While some passengers admit to using app based taxi hailing services simply as they offer the lowest rates in the market, an emerging number of passengers claim that they would use such services simply to feel safer during their travels. In a nutshell, passengers would always choose the option that provides them a fair rate along with the guarantee of safety and perhaps reliability.
Drivers
In the case of drivers, many of those who prefer to operate independently do so as it allows them more freedom to manage other aspects of lives along with work. For example, a working father would prefer to have a time frame free to take kids to and from school. As a driver who switched to working for an app based company afterworking independently with a meter attached to his three wheeler attested, app based services bring in more hires. One driver argued that while he can charge more from passengers if he operates independently, working in partnership with a company allows him to find an increased volume of hires.
For Example, one of Sri Lankas Taxi Hailing service PickMe, operates at the lowest per KM rate to the passengers, whilst complimenting the drivers with high incentive schemes varying as per fleet and driver preference of full time or part time.
As a recent report indicates, mobile penetration in Sri Lanka has risen from 96% in 2012 to 126% in 2017. As more and more Sri Lankans get used to relying on various apps (a growing trend in Sri Lanka), taxi hailing apps too will become even more relevant.
And finally
Sri Lankas app based taxi hailing market is a competitive one. The number of companies that offer this service has increased as of late. As long as the competition is healthy and no one tries to offer ridiculously lower rates to scare off competition and then build a monopoly, the new system should work in favour of both passengers and drivers.

The Cabinet, which met at the Presidential Secretariat under President Maithripala Sisirsena, today approved a Vote on Account to cover the Governments expenditure for the first quarter of 2019, a Senior Minister said.
He said that Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Finance Minister submitted the Cabinet memorandum seeking the approval.
The Government is to present the Vote on Account to Parliament for the approval soon, he said.
Earlier, former Finance Minister UNP MP Mangala Samaraweera in a statement said that the illegal Government had no majority to pass a Vote on Account.
A legitimate Government with an adequate majority in Parliament would have had the opportunity to present at least a Vote on Account, which would have covered at least the first three months of the new year, enabling payment of pensions, salaries, Samurdhi payments, and settlement of debts.
It is still not too late to re-establish the Government that commands the clear majority in Parliament to present a budget/Vote on Account to authorize expenditure from the consolidated fund from 2019, MP Samaraweera in his statement said.

Communication gap led to their absence
	

Some prominent Pohottuwa members had been conspicuous by their absence at the ceremony held to solemnize the Pohottuwa-Betel-political marriage.

Later, Pohottuwa high-ups on the advice of the former strongman had made inquiries why these party front-liners failed to turn up at the historic occasion.
And the inquiries had revealed that the parties responsible for conveying the important message to the party stalwarts had floundered.
One of the high-ups who had failed to carry out this duty entrusted by the party leadership is said to be the politico hailing from the political cum cricket family in Gampaha, they say.

Compromise, the need of the hour
	
The country has been fast drifting towards further turmoil days ago due to irresponsible and power hungry politicians. It is not clear whether the situation has changed despite Mondays Parliament sitting ending without riots.
The last weeks ugly scenes in the Parliament could be a precursor to an unfortunate situation to come. Not a single leader seems to be regretting the rowdy behaviour of their members who unflinchingly turned the august assembly where the sovereignty of more than 20 million people is said to lie into a battleground, while the whole country was watching. 
The members who, very well knowing that the cameras had been turned towards them behaved unruly and vandalized the chamber of the Parliament are still scot-free. And it is not sure that they would be penalized either at least for the vandalism which occurred under the very eyes of the tax payer who had already paid for the items destroyed by their representatives and who have to pay again for the reparation of them. 
It is President Maithripala Sirisena who has to take responsibility for this confusion and the political impasse. His dislike to run the government with Ranil Wickremesinghe who he removed from the Prime Minister post on October 26 is comprehensible. There was a cold-war between them during the last two years, beginning from the Presidents allegations that the UNP was standing on his way to take to task those who committed acts of high profile corruption during the Rajapaksa regime. However, the remedy to his woes should not have landed the country in this political impasse. 
His choice to replace Ranil Wickremesinghe with his adversary Mahinda Rajapaksa could not have been challenged had he made the calculations properly, and ensured that his nominee commanded the confidence of the Parliament, without depending on brokers who were politically nowhere. Despite the controversy over the legality over the passage of the two no-confidence motions against Premier Rajapaksa, the legality of his appointment in the eyes of the general public and the international community is in question, in the light of the number of signatures the motions carried in them. 
Now, the issue has become one of prestige and ego on the part of the four main stakeholders, the President, Prime Minister, Speaker and the former Prime Minister, for which the country has been forced to pay a price. All four have to prove that they are correct not by muscle power of their subordinates, but by legal and ethical means. 
The President must prove that he removed Wickremesinghe from the premier post and appointed Rajapaksa in his place legally. He cant leave it to the Parliament alone. Rajapaksa also must prove his majority without hiding behind legal technicalities. Wickremesinghe must take the same responsibility without portraying the opposition to Rajapaksas appointment among the members of Parliament as an endorsement of him as the Prime Minister. If they cannot do so they must withdraw from the fray respectfully as gentlemen, without leading to a further unfortunate situation in the country. 
Unfortunately the issue is not only one concerning prestige or ego on the part of the leaders; rather the highly politicized masses also have taken it as an ego issue on their part. They do not like to be on the losing side irrespective of where the law and the ethics stand. Therefore, like the sword of Damocles there is always a danger of spilling over of the rowdy behaviour of the politicians which we witnessed last week in the Parliament to the people in the villages and towns. It would be dangerous and would tarnish the image of the country which had already eroded by the underworld-like behaviour of the politicians in the Parliament last week. 
Respecting the law without resorting to underhand manoeuvring while respectfully preparing to compromise without inciting their party supporters by the leaders is the only way out. Yes, this demands a lot of courage and moral strength.

Conspirator gets dose of his own medicine
	

A Diyawanna politico from Matale who was keen on clinching the political marriage between the Blue party and Pohottuwa had hit upon a plan to win over the former strongmans consent for it.

He contacted a provincial council member from the South who has made a name as an astrologer as well. He is also well known for foretelling the future by going into a trance. He told the astrologer: The Blue party-Pohottuwa union will become a reality soon if the former Lokka gives his okay. So, if I bring the Lokka to your Devale, can you please go into a trance and foretell that Pohottuwa is sure to suffer a bad defeat if it goes solo at the coming polls, and if it is to clinch a decisive win, it should team up with the Blues.
The astrologer readily agreed to carry out the plan and not to breathe a word about to anyone.
However, the astrologer had wittingly or unwittingly spilled the beans. Finally, the story reached the Lokkas ears too.
The former strongman now wise to the Matale politicos plan to take him for a ride, decided to give the man a taste of his own medicine. So, one day he got into a chat with the Matale politico and casually mentioned that he had occasion to speak to the Galle astrologer.
Ah! What did he tell you, Sir, the Matale man asked suppressing his excitement.
He warned me that we would suffer a bad defeat if we go to polls in alliance with the Blues and advised me not to have any truck with the them if we were keen on winning the polls, 
  
The Matale politico was too stunned for a moment to speak.
The former strongman added: I understand as you often tell me, that this Galle mans predictions are accurate and never go wrong!
The shock the Matale man got was so overwhelming he could hardly cover up his confusion. Oh! Did the man say so! he had stammered.
Watching the Matale politico looking perplexed, the former strongman burst out laughing, they say.

Corporal Punishment, discipline and truth
	
Laws
The Penal Code Amendment Act No. 22 of 1995 provided for the offence of Cruelty to Children (section 308A) reads as follows:
(1) Whoever, having the custody, charge or care of any person under eighteen years of age, will fully assaults, ill-treats, neglects, or abandons such or causes or procures such person to be, ill-treated, neglected, or abandoned, in a manner likely to cause him suffering or injury to health commits the offence of cruelty to children.
Article 82 of the Penal Code 8 states: Nothing, which is done in good faith for the benefit of a person under twelve years of age, or, of unsound mind, by or by consent, either express or implied, of the guardian or other person having lawful charge of that person, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause/or be intended by the doer to cause, or be known by the doer be likely to cause, to that person.
Article 3418 states that, if a schoolmaster, in the reasonable exercise of his discretion as master, flogs one of his scholars, he does not use criminal force, because, although he intends to cause fear and annoyance to the scholar, does not use force illegally.
If you found no ambiguity in the laws governing corporal punishment, you can resume reading our other colourful feature articles expressing the political cries and screams for democracy. However, many analysts or even laymen can explicitly observe a plethora of loopholes in our corporal punishment legislature.
Loop hole 1: If there is only suffering and injury to the health of a child, one can be prosecuted under the law of corporal punishment ( Penal code- 308A)
Loop hole 2: If corporal punishment is done in good faith, it is not illegal ( Article 82 penal code)
Loop hole 3: Penal code Article 341 is stained with many loopholes, where a child can be even flogged if the force is not illegal.
Hence, the laws can be discerned to be a sprawling mess of contradictory legislature. The law in itself is one of the most significant reasons why no one has been prosecuted for corporal punishment. Sri Lanka also needs an attitudinal shift, where parents and teachers understand the detrimental and long-term harm of corporal punishment. However, on a more positive note the End corporal punishment in Sri Lanka: Vision 2020 ( ECP2020) campaign will implement a pentagon proposal inviting five key stakeholders responsible for child protection to work collectively to ECP by 2020. Further, a new organisation called Stop Child Cruelty is on its mission to completely eliminate corporal punishment in Sri Lanka. It is the only internationally acclaimed organisation in Sri Lanka that is dedicated to end corporal punishment from our nation. Further, it also has the patronage of the President and its members.
It is a must thatSri Lankans find the time to read up and analyze the corporal punishment laws that have been enacted. In todays article we take a close look at the mechanics and adversities of corporal punishment in Sri Lanka
	For instance when you are beaten up, children usually become stressed and neglect their studies. When you stop studying you are beaten up more. Hence it is a vicious cycle of beating up
	Of course in the work place physical abuse is seldom seen, however verbal harassment and passive aggression exists in the work environment. The reason is that as children if we learned that hitting is normalised it is carried in their adulthood as well
UNICEFs definition
According to the UNICEF, Corporal Punishment is any punishment in which physical force is used and intended to cause some degree of pain or discomfort, however light. Most involves hitting (smacking, slapping, spanking) In addition, there are other non-physical forms of punishment that are also cruel and degrading and thus incompatible with the Convention. These include, for example, punishment which belittles, humiliates, denigrates, scapegoats, threatens, scares or ridicules the child.
Inadequacies
How much does it cost to change the law Not even a cent, said the strong hearted Dr. Tush Wickramanayaka, Chairperson of Stop Child Cruelty Movement. She said,If people truly believe that there are adequate laws to protect children, then as a nation we do not have to address the issue of corporal punishment. When a child hits a child we call it aggression, when an adult hits an adult we call it assault, but when an adult hits a child we call it discipline. This is the sad and ironic truth.
We must teach people other mechanisms of how to discipline children. Corporal punishment is not simply physically beating a child, but it also includes non physical punishment such as making children kneel, stand on one leg or keep them in the sun for hours.
She explained the significance of the UNCRC, and Sri Lankas journey in accomplishing the goals of the UNCRC (UN Convention on the Rights of the Child), In 1992 Sri Lanka ratified and signed Article 43 (1991), established in the UNCRC, which proposed to end corporal punishment. As many as 152 countries signed UNCRC and 131 have banned corporal punishment in schools while 53 countries have banned corporal punishment in homes and schools. In 2030, according the UN sustainable development goals, goal 16.2 particularly addresses violence against children. Therefore Sri Lanka would come under increasing pressure to address corporal punishment, including by enacting and implementing laws that send a clear message that violent punishment of children is no longer acceptable.
We did change our law in 1995, by amending the penal code 308A, where it said you could go to jail for corporal punishment, but only if there was suffering or injury to health
Explaining Sri Lankas current position, she said, Since 1992, Sri Lanka has had 4 executive presidents and 9 prime ministers and 6 general elections. But we still have not been able to live up to the agreement of the UNCRC. The constitution clearly states that every citizen has the equal protection by law.
We did change our law in 1995, by amending the penal code 308A, where it said you could go to jail for corporal punishment, but only if there was suffering or injury to health. This law is problematic because UNCRC expects the law to be explicit where there is no loophole for the perpetrator to escape. Further, the penal code Article 82 shows that if such punishment is done in good faith for the benefit of a person under twelve years of age it is not against the law. This shows how confusing our law is and it also shows why we need a complete blanket ban on corporate punishment. She said.
She further added by saying, The UNRC in February this year issued a red alert regarding this island. Sri Lanka should not take it lightly when ratifying anything associated with its international commitments. We have been assessed annually since 1992. But now the UNCRC is fed up, so we learn. Our next assessment is coming in 2020 and many believe we will have banned corporate punishment by then.
Sri Lanka
Corporal punishment has been so ingrained in our society, that it has been truly hard to completely get rid of it. We have to accept the fact that practices that have existed for generations are very hard to change. It is sad that there is a mistaken notion that it is good for the child. Sometimes when I visit schools and homes I still see the cane resting in the corner of a room, and that is disturbing. Can we not discipline children in any other way Asked Dr. Hiranthi Wijemanne, Former Chairperson NCPA (National Child Protection Authority), Former Director of UNICEF, Former Member Presidential Task Force on Child protection.
Once I gave a lecture on corporal punishment at a leading school in Colombo, and after the lecture a teacher came up to me and said I am what I am today because I was hit. I said if you were not hit you would have been the principal of this school, said Prof, Harendra de Silva, Founding Chairperson, NCPA and Professor Emeritus of Paediatrics (Col), Former Member Presidential Task Force on Child Protection.
He spoke on why we need to stop corporal punishment, It is important that we all realise that hitting somebody is bad whether it be an adult or a child. If an adult is beaten up, it has the right and the power to rely on the law to solve the issue. But, a child has no forum to speak out. People argue that they were beaten and nothing happened to them, hence there is no problem in doing so. It is also important to realise that some children are resilient, where they cannot be easily pushed down. However not all are resilient. Beating up a person may not always cause permanent physical harm to a child, but it can negatively affect the mind. When the mind is effected it may lead to short-term or long term mental harm.
He further illustrated the vicious cycle of corporal punishment. This harm often becomes inter-generational. For instance when you are beaten up, children usually become stressed and neglect their studies. When you stop studying you are beaten up more. Hence it is a vicious cycle of beating up. The child falls back in class work and the parents may also encourage the beating up of the child, or they themselves may beat up the child. The child may loiter around in order to avoid being beating up; he will get into bad company and be influenced to take up smoking or consume drugs and alcohol. I have done studies with my colleagues on the behaviour of young people and we found that their physical, mental and sexual aggression is directly attributable to their childhood behaviour. Those who have been beaten and sexually abused usually reciprocate such actions in their adolescence. Thus, todays abuse becomes tomorrows abuser. Hence, the violence we experience today is the violence that the perpetrator had experienced during childhood, because they have justified that behaviour. He added.
Once I gave a lecture on corporal punishment at a leading school in Colombo, and after the lecture a teacher came up to me and said I am what I am today because I was hit
Dr Piyanjali De Zoysa, Professor in Clinical Psychology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo, elaborated on why corporal punishment persists in the country. She said, When we consider why an adult would beat up a child we see that most people do this with an idea of compliance. They expect the child to behave at that certain time. Usually when you hit a child or pull at the childs hair, there is immediate compliance. Most people are very happy about that. But as rational adults we want something more than immediate compliance and we want something more for our children. We want to make them functioning citizens of the world.
She further showed how there is no moral internalisation when a child is subjected to corporal punishment, and added,  The values that the adults want to impart to the child when they hit a child is not internalised. For instance when a child is hit for not producing the completed home work, the child feels unhappy, shameful and angry. They do not grasp the message that the teacher wants to give. The biggest problem when a child is hit is that they do not learn societal values. Children also learn that aggression is okay. They begin to imitate this behaviour. This is seen in our state universities when students rag other students and at the work place when we find work place harassment. Of course in the work place physical abuse is seldom seen, however verbal harassment and passive aggression exists in the work environment. The reason is that as children if we learned that hitting is normalised it is carried in their adulthood as well.
She highlighted the three main reasons that teachers beat up children, referring to a study done by Professor Harendra De Silva in an island wide survey, in six district in Sri Lanka on school corporal punishment: Not doing homework, Love affairs and Dress code.
These are basic issues that are seen in all schools in the globe. Children not doing homework because there is an inundation of homework in our system and having love affairs and not dressing properly are normal psycho-sexual behaviour. However, beating children for such behaviour has a plethora of consequences.
How can we stop this
The attitudes of people have not changed since their childhood. However, Prof. Harendra illustrated the different stages we need to go through to stop corporal punishment:
Provide information and knowledge to the people, as to why we should we not beat up a child. This knowledge must be ingrained within the people.
We need to have attitudinal change; simply giving knowledge is insufficient.
We must provide skills to people regarding what to do when a child misbehaves.
Children are beaten usually because of sudden anger. After the anger has whittled, the parent is usually sad and sorry, and gives a treat to the child to compensate for the beating. Hence the child is rewarded for the bad behaviour.
Most people believe that corporal punishment is part of our culture and other forms of soft discipline is from western culture
A peep into history
Dr Piyanjali debunked a popular myth in Sri Lanka and said, Most people believe that corporal punishment is part of our culture and other forms of soft discipline is from western culture.
In reference to the Chulawamsa it says that in the 1200s during the Anuradhapura and Polonaruwa Era we had two kings Vijayabahu and Vijayabahu III, who introduced legislature explicitly stating that there should be no physical punishment on both adults and children.
Therefore, our culture was such that had a negative view on corporal punishment. However, when we were colonised the subjugations brought in the practice of corporal punishment with them, from public school practices from their respective countries.
The ironic thing is, those countries have let go of the practice while we still embrace it. Hence, corporal punishment is a practice from the western world that we are dearly holding on to.

Some individuals shared their experiences and thoughts about corporal punishment with the Daily Mirror
Students told me about the harassment
Lukshi Ranasinghe
Youth Ambassador of the Stop Child Cruelty organization, Lukshi Ranasinghe , Centenary Head Prefect of Visaka Vidyalaya said, When I was head prefect a lot of students have come and told me about the harassment they faced at the hands of their teachers and their peers. Ragging does not only happen at university, it also happens at school level and most children resort to cutting themselves and suffer from depression. Teachers oppress students much and they propagate a fear mentality where they make children believe what happens in school must stay in schools. I believe children should have the freedom to tell what happens in school.
Change can be created through education
Sidath Wettimuny
Sidath Wettimuny former cricketer and a patron to the Stop Child Cruelty Organization said, When I was a young boy I was slapped twice and up to date I still do not know why I was slapped because I did not feel I deserved to be slapped. Over the years I have been thinking why was I slapped and what made that teacher do it. The conclusion I came to many years later was that the teacher was not trying to punish me, but he was trying to vent out his own frustration by using me or he tried to use me to teach the other kids by using me as a vehicle for abuse.
I think that the seed of punishment gives rise to the fruits of resentment, discontent, dislike and all the bad qualities that can be fermented in our mind. I feel it is that fermentation that exudes especially when university students rag other students. This is the position that our adults can take up. Ragging is a weakness in the minds of the ragger. The student who rags is weak. I am shocked as to what I see, and as a country we have much violence in communities and political parties. All this stems from our youth. I believe we cannot change this attitude in a day. For instance we want to change the cricketing philosophy in our cricketers and we want to do it slowly, but steadily. We create this change through educating the coaches and I believe to change the attitudes of corporal punishment we must change the attitudes of the teachers.
Entrepreneur, philanthropist, activist and a patron of stop child cruelty organization, Otara Gunewardene said, I have never been punished in my home or school. I always support kindness and passion for all, whether it be children or adults alike. As much as I see so much kindness and passion I see so much cruelty every day. It is important for us as a country to grow with kindness as it is our only way forward.
You cant beat up children
Kavindu Dhanyrda
Kavindu Dhanyrda Indatisaa said, We had a priest in school who used to find excuses to punish boys because he seemed to enjoy it. He hurt me in the stomach once even though I simply stood up in class to go throw something in the dustbin. I believe you cannot beat up children or make them kneel outside, simply because they talked to a friend in class or went to throw something in the bin.
Teachers shouldnt touch students
A student from a popular school in Kiribathgoda said,When we were in grade 11, a batch mate of mine was slapped across the face in front of the whole class by the class teacher because she was seeing a boy. I witnessed this as I was walking past that class. I dont think teachers should be allowed to touch students because that violates students rights. It transfers an immense amount of power to teachers which make the students hopeless, powerless and ultimately left with no trust in the school system. I feel it is a true abuse of power.

Proclamation of the dissolution of Diyawanna had witnessed some Pohottuwa Diyawanna hopefuls across the country putting up life-size cutouts, banners and posters in a mad rush to announce their candidacy at the coming polls.

Most of those aspirants were former heads of local bodies and former provincial council members, they say.
The former strongman, now the controversial Number Two, had been both surprised and amused to find some party hopefuls had decided to contest on the party ticket even without his nod or knowledge. All these hopefuls had also made it a point to display the leaders mug as well on these posters to support their credentials as party nominees.
What had greatly amused the former strongman was that some local politicos had put up posters claiming to be the partys National List nominees, they say.

His latest try too goes sour
	

Gemunu from Ruhuna who had been making newspaper headlines ever since shifting his roost to Kelaniya was forced into political wilderness with the advent of yahapalanaya. However, the man continued to steal the limelight from time to time resorting to some publicity gimmick or other. 

His latest stunt was to join forces with the Green diehards who have pitched camp at Temple Trees poised for a do or die battle to protect their leader..
Gemunu, after a few days of wining and dining with the Greens at Temple Trees had gone round his onetime haunts in the Gampaha district to say howdy to old friends and some prominent monks. While on this round, he had confided in them that he was being inundated with requests from the Green high-ups to contest in the district on the Green ticket at the general polls round the corner. He had even told some Green Diyawanna members from the district that no less a person than the party leader himself had wanted him to come forward as a party candidate.
Meanwhile, some Green seniors who had heard about the claim being made by Gemunu, had met the Green leader to tell him that they would not support Gemunu if he were fielded as a party candidate at the coming polls. This objection had put paid to Gemunus latest ambition, they say.

Insights on Raja Yoga Meditation A meditation suitable for all
	
The majority of people in the world today who wish to learn how to meditate do so because they want to relax. In a world of constant demands, where everything appears to happen at lighting speed, people want to learn the technique of freeing themselves from the variety of tensions they face, find an inner calm to bring about balance in their lives and sustain positive frame of mind.
Meditation is an ancient tradition, which involves far more than just relaxing and being positive. It is also a way to enlighten the mind. An enlightened mind is one filled with peace, clarity and kindness. Clarity enables the individual to make decisions, which are benevolent and accurate for the self and others; kindness protects the self and others from harmful effects of the minds negative desires. The aim of meditation is to use the values of wisdom, peace and kindness to enable the individual to control the mind, to keep in order.
However, even in ancient times, the mind was understood to be extremely difficult to control. It was said to be like the wind: you could never catch it, or hold it- it went where it wished and no human being could become its master. In other instances it was said that the mind was like an elephant: extremely powerful but equally gentle and patient, able to do lot of work for its master. However when an elephant turns wild, its gentleness and patience completely disappear and it destroys and damages everything in its path. When the mind is under stress, it resembles a wild elephant, it has no control and cannot be controlled.
Taming the mind is regarded as a great art requiring time, attention, practice and above all, a sincerity of heart where individuals truly want to change their way of thinking. To relax, to be positive, to be peaceful and kind all require a change in our thought patterns and this can only happen when we look deeply within. However hard they try, other people cannot change us; we must have personal realization and the desire to make changes through our own effort. Permanent and positive change cannot be imposed from outside; it is something we choose. 
Meditation is the discovery of that point of silence within, like a compass needle that guides us in the right direction at the right time. To become silent, to be still in the ocean of hectic, noisy action, is a choice many people are now making. When this is achieved, this stillness acts on the mind like oxygen, giving breath to both understanding and enrich life. Of course, action is a necessity, an expression of ourselves through time, relationship and the roles we play. However if we do not sometimes stop and take a breath of silence, then the mind begins to suffocate, thoughts speed like bullet trains and the brain feels as if it is in a pressure cooker. Emotions erupt and react like volcanoes, the eyes become dizzy with mountains of information and the head feels like a roller-coaster. This is stress. The mind needs to leave the jungle of pressure, deadlines and speed and settle down and find the point of silence within.
Raja Yoga or in other words meditation is the method to find that point which recharges the mind with peace, clarityand balance.
An exhibition on Raja Yoga for mind and body fitness along with practical experiences of meditation will be held on 22nd November, 2018 Poya Day from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. at Lawsaka Sports Academy 16/1/c, 1st Lane, Campus Road, Katubedda, Moratuwa.
Free admission. All are welcome.
Organized by Brahma Kumaris Raja Yoga Centre, Dehiwela.

JVP to move resolution calling for election after defeating political coup: Anura
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today they would bring in a resolution to dissolve parliament and pave the way for a General Election soon after defeating the current political coup.
JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake was speaking at a rally held in Maharagama on the theme Defeat dictatorial fury and win democracy.
He said neither Mahinda faction nor the Ranil faction had a right to form a government right now as they had violated the mandate of the people who were the ones that should decide who forms a new government.
The Rajapaksa government which was formed after buying over MPs in parliament has no right to govern the country. The Ranil faction has also violated the mandate given in 2015. Both factions have no right to form a government. The right to form a new government should be given over to the people, he said.
Mr. Dissanayake said, however, they were not prepared to go for an election under this illegitimate government and added that they would make every effort to defeat this coup in parliament, in court and in the streets.
The President continues to violate the Constitution. If this continues, it would lead to a bloodbath. When Parliament does not accept the government and the Cabinet, the government rules the country against the Constitution. This will end in bloodbath, he said.
He said the JVP came forward to rectify what has taken place for the sake of democracy and added that if this was not rectified, it would set a bad precedent.
Some people question as to why we are so perturbed about what is taking place in the country at present. Ranil is concerned because he has lost the premiership. However, we are concerned because it is a threat to democracy, he said.(Ajith Siriwardana)

Make Karu Jayasuriya PM to resolve constitutional impasse Call the Oppositions bluff
	
A gentleman would be ashamed should his deeds not match his words.
~Confucius
There is no serious negotiation under way. When the countrys constitution is being so seriously questioned, when the animal-like instincts and uncouth character of its political life are being portrayed in public to the whole wide world, when those who have been elected to political office, except one solitary man, are acting like the power that they wield is their private and personal property bequeathed by a divine being, when they act as if that power qualifies them to behave in the most atrocious manner in the very House of the People, Parliament, when those who are purported to be representing the common man, are debasing the values that common man holds so precious, sacred and noble, the real common man is astounded on the one hand and angry and thoroughly disgruntled on the other with those who have deliberately chosen to tear apart the document which is our Constitution from which cascade the rule of law, our justice system, its intricate and intrinsic measures and the very substance of a democratic society. 
Never blew his own trumpet or prompting or pressurising others to blow his trumpet
	He withstood the barrage of insults and criticism and upheld the parliament democracy
What was exhibited to the world is not an angry reaction of one party to an antagonistic point of view of another. Over the last few days, specifically on November 14, 15 and 16, what in fact was manifested was an ugly orgy of the representatives of the common man; this is what SWRD Bandaranaike created; this is what resulted from the ill-planned, ill-thought out process of an Oxford pundit. When uneducated ruffians are sent to parliament and when their Masters are openly backing them, what destiny are we seeking as a collective people 
Who is the solitary man who stood between these marauding hooligans against justice and fair-play Who showed that he still possessed a spine that is made of tempered steel Karu Jayasuriya, the Speaker of the House of Parliament defied the odds. The odds stacked up against him and against fair-play were formidable; they were uncouth, uncivilized and inhuman, yet to withstand such an outbreak of un-nuanced vitriol, such a barrage of disgraceful and shameless greed, catapulting of books and chairs, to endure the scorn of a minority and yet literally hold his floor and promulgate the factual status of the majoritys wish of the House was no easy endeavour. 
But Karu did it. When Bandaranaikes common men and women ransacked the Chambers of Parliament and its invaluable books and journals, when they used such invaluable material as their bullets and bazooka, Karu Jayasuriya, a very common man born and bred in Siyane Korale, educated at Ananda College, a leading Buddhist Educational Institution in Sri Lanka, did all of us proud. Ranil Wickremesinghe should step down in the name of his Party, of his ancestors, his government and in the name of his country. Period. How would President Sirisena respond to the nomination of Karu Jayasuriya as Prime Minister Would he renege on that too Itll be unimaginable. The only way to call President Sirisenas bluff is to nominate Karus name as PM. And if Karu agrees, they can save their Premiership, their coalition-government without the SLFP, (if the SLFP guys want to join the Cabinet, they must join the UNP or any other Party that is part and parcel of the coalition) and above all the country and her democratic way of governance and life. Defended and armoured by unarmed bodies of policemen, forming an impenetrable ring around the Speaker, a gallant proclamation was made: there is no confidence in the Rajapaksa-premiership. Hard times require harder decisions. Ranils legacy would be that he saved democracy in Sri Lanka and he would be proud to leave behind such a glorious legacy. All matters that are bound to matter in the ensuing twelve (12) months are secondary at this very moment. A resuscitation of the Rajapaksa family and their inglorious rule should be given permanent leave. 
Defended and armoured by unarmed bodies of policemen, forming an impenetrable ring around the Speaker, a gallant proclamation was made: there is no confidence in the Rajapaksa-premiership
November 16, 2018 was, to quote American President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a day of infamy for all Sri Lankans. We ought to be thoroughly ashamed of our own political leaders and especially of those who wrongly assume that they are the government. Such a blatant exhibition of hooliganism and vitriol, gushing from those who represent the Pohottuwa-gang has no precedent in the manner in which the very substance of the issue in question: who controls the majority in the House of Parliament. The apparently bottomless mine into which the Executive has plunged the countrys polity seems to be spiralling further downwards; those who are near the mine are digging deeper and deeper; there doesnt seem to be any sane quarter that is genuinely interested in the interest of the country and her people to ask them to stop digging! 
It is indeed a sad story to tell our grandchildren. But let us not leave this to our future historians. Their interpretations may well be out of context. MRs unlawful assertion and his obvious dis-entitlement as the countrys Prime Minister are not in question anymore. An ordinary parliamentarian who was sworn in as Prime Minister under the cover of false Executive powers, read out a statement that consisted of assertions beyond comprehension; it spoke about his love for the country; he alleged that the Speaker of Parliament was wrong in recognizing the right of the majority. In other words, he, from the well of the House of the Peoples will, prophesized a tyranny of the minority. A minority consisting of corrupt, uncouth and uneducated set of street thugs garbed in western-style suits of usual Manthree (MP)-kit, resorted to bullying, intimidation and savagery. What can one expect from the commoners who were elected from a political ideology that idealized the commonality of the common man 
Decency is uncommon; dignity is uncommon; respect is uncommon; common sensed conduct is uncommon and the great irony is all these petty hoodlums of parliament pretending to be its custodians are common. The common mans party has produced wastes of Sri Lankas politics; their puny personalities are so common it is hardly separable from the common waste matter of any species. 
Yet, the real authentic common man is doomed; his hopes and desires for social climbing are being threatened; his educational aspirations are dwindling and his life-goals are receding further and further. These so-called representatives of the common man are a disgrace to the grace of that real common man. He wakes up each morning; wakes his children up and gets them ready for school; offers his thanks to Buddha in the tiny shrine room. He drops the children at the bus stand and treks his way to the paddy field he so fondly ploughs and sees that sufficient amount of water is channelled to his plot - its real hard work which none of these politicos has ever understood or had the competence or basic discipline to apply themselves to. That is the real life of a real common man. 
When he gets back home with a crimson sun setting on the distant horizon; dusk surrounds his humble abode; his children are busy with homework; his sweetheart wife is preparing a measly meal of rice, pol sambol and kiri hodi which the whole family partakes of with unpretentious pleasure and no complaint. His desires are few but he knows the limits his desires could reach. But his hopes and aspirations are many and more often than not, boundless. He wants freedom of movement; he desires freedom of communication; he demands freedom of thought and its limitless expression. One thing that he does not demand or require is to be represented by a village thug or a city-dwelling ruffian who makes all his money from illicit liquor or trafficking life-endangering drugs. 
He stood for the common interests of the common man, while the MR-led hooligans in parliament openly expressed in no uncertain words and actions that they wanted to destroy and extinguish the common mans unassuming goals
It is that common man and his humble desires and wants that Karu Jayasuriya tried to defend in Parliament on that fateful day. Karu Jayasuriya stood for the common interests of the common man, while the MR-led hooligans in parliament openly expressed in no uncertain words and actions that they wanted to destroy and extinguish the common mans unassuming goals. 
One unconstitutional act, the naming of Mahinda Rajapaksa as new Prime Minister, has to be defended by another unconstitutional act, dissolution of Parliament. As in all human affairs, when a crisis deepens, when the abyss looks nearer and nearer, a very few good men and women rise up against such a suicidal march. Karu Jayasuriya dwells among those few. Without trying to blow his own trumpet or prompting or pressurising others to blow his trumpet, Jayasuriya made that stance look like an event of his normal day at work. 
The country needs such men. The present crisis needs such men. The hour needs such men. Remember, the legacy of the present generation has to be one of magnificence and courage; it needs to be one of humility and sacrifice; it needs to be one that our grandchildren would be proud to tell their grandchildren. Karu Jayasuriya is a gentleman in politics, maybe among the last few of that kind.

## Title: Moodys latest rating decision unfounded: CBSL

Moodys latest rating decision unfounded: CBSL
	
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) today said it is of the view that the decision by Moody's to downgrade Sri Lankan Government's foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured ratings from B1 (Negative) to B2 (Stable) does not properly reflect the countrys macroeconomic fundamentals, and therefore unwarranted.
In a statement, the CBSL said it wishes to reiterate that Sri Lankas macroeconomic position has neither deteriorated nor has there been any policy slippage since Moodys last rating decision in July 2018, in spite of the recent developments in the countrys political sphere.
In fact, based on satisfactory programme performance, the Sri Lankan authorities and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reached staff-level agreement following the fifth review of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme on 26 October 2018, and the agreement was to be announced on 29 October 2018. The programme discussions are currently on hold, pending clarity on the political situation.
Sri Lankas current level of gross official reserves (GOR) amounting to US dollars 7.2 billion is sufficient for the country to meet its external debt obligations in the period ahead. In addition, as a precautionary measure, the CBSL has initiated negotiations with central banks of friendly nations with regard to obtaining foreign currency SWAP facilities of sizable amounts. These measures will further strengthen the countrys foreign reserve adequacy, and would enable timely servicing of external obligations while intervening cautiously in the foreign exchange market to prevent a disorderly adjustment of the exchange rate. In addition, the fiscal and macro prudential measures that are already in place are expected to result in an improvement in the external trade balance as well, thus reducing pressure on external reserves and the exchange rate.
Arrangements have already been made to ensure Sri Lankas track record of meeting debt obligations on time is sustained. In order to meet the Governments external liabilities of International Sovereign Bond (ISB) maturities of US dollars 1 billion in January 2019 and US dollars 500 million in April 2019, the authorities have already built a buffer fund from proceeds of the divestment of Hambantota port and the syndicated loan of China Development Bank (CDB). The space provided under the Active Liability Management initiative not exceeding a limit of Rs. 310 billion also provides for building required buffers and spaces to meet future debt service payments. In addition, the issuance of Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs) of around US dollars 750 million to US dollars 1 billion during the remainder of the year and in early 2019 is now at an advanced stage of completion. These investments would be sourced through enhanced credit lines for state banks from the Middle East and East Asia, together with remittance and tourism related inflows. In addition, the US dollars 500 million enhancement, in February 2019, to the syndicated loan obtained from CDB is also on track. This means that by February 2019 more than USD 2 bn will be mobilized. This would more than cover all the ISB payments due in 2019. In addition the buffer can be further built up through USD 600 mn expected as disbursements from bilateral and multilateral agencies during next year.
Meanwhile, domestic financing conditions have shown considerable improvement through spaces created and debt management strategies introduced recently. This has reduced the roll-over requirement of Treasury bonds and SLDBs in 2019, 2020 and in the medium-term. The Treasury bond maturities, which amounted to over Rs. 600 billion in 2018, are lower in 2019 and 2020, amounting to around Rs. 450 billion and Rs. 290 billion, respectively. Similarly, SLDB maturities, which amounted to around US dollars 2.3 billion in 2018, have also been reduced to around US dollars 0.62 billion and US dollars 0.82 billion in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Further, the new acquisition of government securities by the banking sector has increased by only 1.5 per cent in 2018 as against the trend increase of around 5 per cent in recent years. These developments along with resource availability among institutional investors highlight the substantial space that exists to meet financing requirements from the domestic market. Continued fiscal consolidation, particularly with the positive primary balance and the Active Liability Management initiatives, are expected to further strengthen the governments fiscal operations in 2019 and in the medium term.
Given these parameters, the CBSL is of the view that the recent rating action by Moodys is unwarranted. Such an action only on the premise of heightened political uncertainty, with no evidence of slippages in macroeconomic policies, cannot be justified, the statement said.

She is said to be planning to make it to Diyawanna from the Gampaha district which had once turned another cutie into a lawmaker overnight.
The lovely and fair ones latest fancy has highly ruffled the political heavyweight who had been the power behind her meteoritic rise to fame.
However, she has already set her heart on entering the political arena with a big bang come hell or high water let alone a mentors objections, they say.

There would not be a crisis in servicing debt in the next year, a team of top Government officials briefed the Cabinet today
A Minister said yesterday that Central Bank Governor Dr Indrajit Coomaraswamy, Economic Advisor to the President Prof. Lalith Samarakoon and Finance Ministry Secretary S.R. Attygalle made a detailed presentation about the debt situation and the present status of the economy to the Ministers.
They made this briefing in the wake of remarks made by former Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera that the new Government would face a huge crisis in paying loans and interests amounting to the US $ 1 billion in January, as the annual budget could not be passed.
After yesterdays Cabinet meeting, International Trade Minister Bandula Gunawardane told the Daily Mirror that such a crisis would not arise as pointed out by these officials.
The Minister said the laws governing the issuance of Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds would enable the Government to proceed with its Debt Servicing without any legal problem. (Kelum Bandara)

One for the road gets friend in the wrong tuk-tuk
	
The story is about a person who did not have the patience to receive his friends hospitality.
His best friend from Galle arrived in Kandy by train to watch the test match played at Pallekele.
On arrival, his Kandyan friend could not resist the idea of accompanying him in a trishaw to his house to spend the day.
On their way, the friends had one for the road as it was taboo at his residence. While on their way, the Kandyan was toying with the idea to serve his buddy lavishly and stopped the trishaw by the roadside to make purchases for the welcome party. While he went shopping, his Galle friend who was advised to stay in the trishaw got tempted to tour the city.
Later, he had returned but got into a parked trishaw mistaking it for the one they arrived in. Seeing all the vegetables, fruits, rice, curries and also a small cake inside the trishaw, our friend was overjoyed. Unable to control himself with a luscious cake besides him, he decided to go for a nib and was delighted and began to eat it. Suddenly, he was disturbed by the scream of a woman who got into the drivers seat. She shouted, thief! A crowd including two policemen who were on duty rushed to the scene.
With all the commotion taking place, the Kandy friend returned and started looking for his buddy, only to find the situation he has got himself into. (Dammika Gunawardene)

Interesting to see UNP, JVP and TNA politicians meeting with the members of the international community. Perhaps if more effort was given towards meeting with the people of Sri Lanka and paying heed to their hope for elections, Sri Lanka can finally achieve its fullest potential, the parliamentarian tweeted.
Meanwhile, Canadian High Commissioner David McKinnon replying to Rajapaksa said, You might ask some of your Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna colleagues who theyre meeting with,
Rajapaksa then thanked the High Commissioner for his engagement. Recalling that Sri Lanka remains a sovereign nation and home to a brilliant people, the leaders of Sri Lanka, whoever they may be, should focus on engaging with Sri Lankan people and solving their concerns, including their call for elections, he replied.

Our party will not be a cat's-paw for others-C.V.
	
Former Chief Minister of the Northern Provincial Council C.V. Wigneswaran maintained that the political party newly created by him was formed amidst various difficulties and the objective of the party is not to enter into an alliance with another party and play second fiddle to them.
The former CM expressed these views at a central committee of the newly formed TMK party held at a public reception hall at Kandamadam Junction in Jaffna.
He expressed this view in response to a question raised by a participant who wanted to know what the TMKs stand was with regard to Opposition Leader R.Sampanthans proposal for all Tamil parties to get together at this crucial time.
He re-iterated that neither he nor his party would ever join hands with the Tamil National Alliance for any reason nor contest an election under their symbol and that this decision was taken by him some time back when they organised a series of events to help Tamils of the North to rise up.
However, he said the TNA had shown that it was envious of anything undertaken by him for the benefit of the Tamil people and they had even worked to remove him from the Chief Minister's post as a result. He said this clearly showed how ungrateful the TNA leaders were towards him after all that he had done during his tenure as Chief Minister.
He promised to make the TMK the foremost party in the North which works diligently for the sake of the people who have been fooled by the TNA that has taken them for granted. (Romesh Madushanka)

The MP said the UNF was ready to face a presidential election if the Supreme Court ruled against the holding of a general election.
He told Anunayake of the Malwatte Chapter the Ven. Dimbulkumbure Wimaladharma Thera that it was possible to hold both presidential and general elections at the same time and added that even the incumbent president could contest the election.
The MP said it was not advisable to go for an election because of the prevailing chaotic situation in parliament and said how a peaceful election could be held in the country when a vote could not be taken in parliament. (Nadeeka Daya Bandara)

## Title: Sirisena has a  hidden agenda Kumara welgama

Sirisena has a  hidden agenda Kumara welgama
	
While on to its fourth consecutive week of political instability, Sri Lanka is once again in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. With a confused Government, the people have started questioning their democratic rights. It was quite evident that members of the Joint Opposition showed little or no respect when they disrupted Parliamentary sessions twice. On both occasions, the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) failed to show their majority. Why should the UPFA remain in Government forcibly, questioned United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) heavyweight Kumara Welgama while speaking to the media last Friday. He also said that he would never accept a ministerial post in the coalition Government.
In a candid interview with the Daily Mirror, Welgama reiterated on the possible alternatives Mahinda Rajapaksa could have used to become the premier and what needs to be done to put the country back on track.
Excerpts :
Q You hold an independent view on the current political situation as opposed to other members in the UPFA. Why is that so
I was appointed to the post of Chief Organiser of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) back in 1982 by our first woman Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike. I have fought many elections and in fact have fought them the hard way. I am a very honest member of the SLFP. My electorates have been Matugama, Agalawatte and Bulathsinghala which were areas dominated by the red parties including the Lanka Samasamaja Party. I have seen great politicians such as Dr. Colvin R. De Silva, Anil Munasinghe and Mangala Munasinghe. I studied at S. Thomas College, Mt. Lavinia which is the school that produced three other prime ministers including D. S Senanayake, Dudley Senanayake and S.W.R.D Bandaranaike. So I have that reputation as well. This honesty has been inculcated in me since my school days mainly because I was a regular at Sunday school as well. Thanks to Madam Sirimavo I learned the fundamentals of being a politician and those lessons have made me who I am today.
We could have gone into a provincial council elections and won. Or we could have gone in for a Presidential election with Mahinda as the candidate
Q Why did you refuse to take up a ministerial post in the coalition Government
Back in 2005 I told Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumarathunga that Mahinda Rajapaksa is the most eligible candidate to be the next President. I was in fact the first member to hold a meeting in Matugama to support Rajapaksa. When Sirisena was appointed as the President on January 8, 2015 he was appointed as the SLFP Leader as well. During the first steering committee meeting he said that the SLFP and the UNP would join hands to form a coalition Government. I was the first to oppose that move. So what I predicted in 2015 has come true as that coalition Government was a failure. I also said that if such a government is formed I will never take up a ministerial post because I have a chance of getting one as Im a senior member of the Party.
Then there have been discussions to appoint Mahinda with Basil and Chamal Rajapaksa at Prof. G. L. Pieriss residence to see the possibility of appointing Rajapaksa (MR) as PM. Chamal was opposed to this decision and we knew that Sirisena had a hidden agenda. Hes cunning that way. Otherwise he wouldnt just appoint MR as PM. Ministers such as Keheliya Rambukwella and Mahindananda Aluthgamage who supported this decision thought it will be a good opportunity to put a stop to the privatisation of various ventures. While I immediately opposed this decision, I also said that I will support Mahinda to get a majority and if he wanted a 2/3rds majority as in the Constitution I will vote in favour of him as well.
Q The events that followed from proroguing Parliament to the chaotic parliamentary sessions have put a black mark on the country. Is it good for elected representatives to behave in this manner
We now face a crisis. The country has two prime ministers; one at Temple Trees and the other at the PMs office. The speaker has to take a proper vote. He could have taken it electronically because the voice vote would never work given the chaos. But what I say is that whoever who doesnt show the majority should respect the rule of law and leave. This applies to both the SLFP and the UNP. With the chaos that transpired in Parliament it has put a black mark on the country. I saw how foreign diplomats filmed everything and it was all over media.
With nepotism, people did lose faith in them and because of that we have suffered many losses. But I hope he too has learned his lessons and will not encourage such activities in future
Q In an earlier instance you said that Mahinda would have had a better way to become Premier. What alternatives could he have possibly opted for
We could have defeated the Budget which was supposed to be read on December 5. We could have gone into a provincial council elections and won. Or we could have gone in for a Presidential election with Mahinda as the candidate and won it. But they blindly took this vague decision and you can now witness the crisis.
Q People have taken to the streets, crying out for their democratic rights. Where dothey stand
Theres a case in the Supreme Court and we hope that the judgment would be given on December 7. Depending on that we can go for a fresh election where people can vote, let their voices be heard and elect a fresh Government. But we still havent been able to make that democratic move yet and the whole world is watching us.
Q The International Monetary Fund suspended its loans due to the political instability prevailing in the country. How will this affect the economy
The loan, worth Rs. 1.85 billion, is on hold. In fact its a huge blow to the economy. People will rob each other to find food and money and the situation would be similar to countries such as Venezuela. On January 14, 2019 we have to pay USD 1000 million and at the end of next year we have to pay USD 2546 million. Without money how can we propose a budget Sirisena did have better ways to solve this issue. As at now, everybody has to get together and think about the country. One faction is worried that the other will file cases against them and vice versa. With these tensions we cant return to normalcy.

But what I say is that whoever who doesnt show the majority should respect the rule of law and leave. This applies to both the SLFP and the UNP.
Q What will happen to the Budget
Where is the money to propose a Budget The On Account budget will be tabled, but that is 1/4th of the actual budget.
We are experiencing huge economic losses. So the world needs to see who the actual leader is and we have to work to regain what we lost during the past few days.
Q Do you think that Parliamentary proceedings would run smoothlyon November 23
Yes. Everybody has learned a lesson now. Both sides had their faults. Some were carrying knives while the others meddled with the speakers chair and broke mics.
When people voice out their opinions on TV we can see how they scold the politicians today. I hope and pray that they would act more sanely on Friday.
Q Dont you think that President Sirisena acted prematurely in deciding to appoint a PM
He has always taken decisions in a hurry. Not that Im blaming him, but he didnt know about the 100-day programme or about the petrol and diesel price hike.
When Mahinda was President he took firm and far-sighted decisions.He decided to put an end to the war and he did it. The country needs a leader like him.
Q Two reasons why the Rajapaksa regime was overthrown were because of nepotism and corruption. With Rajapaksa coming into power, chances are high that Gotabaya too would enter the political scene. What are your views 
People may have a fear. Mahinda was determined to put an end to the war and Gotabaya helped him. For that we need to give them the due credit. When J. R Jayewardene was in power, Vadamarachchi was under attack. This was when Lalith Athulathmudali was the Minister of National Security. What resulted was J.R going to India and bringing back a provincial council we didnt want. Likewise they didnt take farsighted decisions. With nepotism, people did lose faith in them and because of that we have suffered many losses. But I hope he too has learned his lessons and will not encourage such activities in future.

Q As a result of the prevailing political instability tourist arrivals have declined despite this being the peak season. How can we recover what we have lost during the past few weeks
We lost Rs. 20 million as a result of tourist cancellations. What we need to do is establish a proper Government, show the majority and pass the Budget if we are to head back to normalcy.

His family and lawyer said he had since been repeatedly denied access to legal representation, and while in custody had been subject to ill-treatment including prolonged solitary confinement and beatings with cables that caused him to temporarily lose hearing in one ear.
Earlier, the Amnesty International condemned the Cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment of a Sri Lankan detained in the Maldives, saying he had been beaten and tortured.
"Following the orders of the President Maithripala Sirisena, I went for the Maldives to look up the case. The case was taken up today. The former President of the Maldives gave us a big support," Minister Mustapha said.
"He had a three-year-old child who did not see his father for three years. During the Three years of time, he had no any connection with his Sri Lankan Family, Minister said.(Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

The first war of independence in Sri Lanka Commemorating 200 years
	
The legacy of freedom people experienced in Sri Lanka for more than 2000 years was threatened by the European colonizers. The Sri Lankans resisted the European colonizers for more than 300 years. The independence of Sri Lanka was confined to the Central and mountain regions of the island. The coastal areas were ruled by the colonizers.
It was in 1815 that the British could take over the whole island. They used the policy of divide and rule and bribe the leaders of the natives to weaken the kingdom. This paved the way for the British to take over the whole island. The last king Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe was a Tamil king. He ruled and resisted the British for 17 years. It was very easy to use the differences in culture and language to divide and weaken Sri Lanka. This policy yet prevails in the rule of Sri Lanka.
The People of Uva-Wellassa had an experience in defeating the colonizers who came to conquer them. They were pioneers of guerilla warfare. When their paddy lands were taken over, cattle destroyed, paddy looted, villages burnt, women raped and children killed the people revolted. This made the whole nation to unite to fight the British. The natives of Sri Lanka were not ready to compromise the countrys freedom with any other. The only strength they had was the faith in freedom and unity of the natives.
It was very easy to use the differences in culture and language to divide and weaken Sri Lanka. This policy yet prevails in the rule of Sri Lanka
Britain was an industrial country. It had all the possessions of the colonies, modern weapons and an experience in colonizing countries. It was not a battle of equals. The natives gave a bitter fight. In the process of September-November 1818, ten thousand natives lost their lives while only 678 lives were lost of the colonizers.( Dr. Davy, Henry Marshall) The natives couldnt face the massacre and had to retreat.
The Uva-Wellassa resistance kept a heroic legacy in the peoples minds. The villages of battles and the personal sacrifices are deeply rooted in the peoples minds.
At a time when Sri Lanka is facing grave political turmoil, visiting and recalling the first war of independence is timely. 
A series of discussions is organized in Colombo, Kandy and Galle.

## Title: The Katina offering The end of Vas
## Section: News Features

The Katina offering The end of Vas
	
Two Senior monks offere the robe to the congregation of monks
If you hear the throb of drums in the early hours of the morning during the period before Il Poya, then you can rest assured that the most important period of a monk is been brought to light by his followers. That then is the first indication that the ritual of Katina offering has commenced. 
The greatest asset of a monk who had received Higher Ordination or Upasampada is the calling for Vas during his life time. 
The offering of Katina Cheevaraya is reported to have commenced during 6th BC in the time of Buddha while he was in Isipathnaramaya, Varanasi, India.
King Rajadhi Rajasinghe during the time of the Kandyan Kingdom offered Katina Cheevara during his entire period of Kingship. So was King Parakramabahu VI of Kotte. It is considered the greatest asset to any man or woman who participates in theKatina ceremonies. 
The cloth at that time was taken from cemeteries, where the practice was to leave the dead in forests. From these covered cloths of dead bodies, the cloth was brought, stitched and then made into a Cheevaraya.

So Devotees all over the country are preparing to offer the Katina Cheevara to the monks who have been in Vas to offer before Il Poya. The observances began from Esala Poya. During this season the monks retreat to their temples or in the early days to forest caves to meditate, in areas where devotees were living to preach the Dhamma of Buddha for their way of life and deliverance. At Aluvihare Vihare some of the cave abodes could be seen to this day and they are in good condition. 
In temples during this period devotees had arranged with the monks to listen to sermons, sometimes daily in the evenings. From last Poya day, devotees in the villages or urban communities are preparing to offer the Katina Cheevara before Il Poya to the monks who have been in Vas during the last three months. Yet only one Katina Cheevaraya or robe could be offered at one temple, even if there are a number of monks who have been in Vas during the season. The offering of the robe is by the devotees, but who should be offered the robe is the decision of thecongregation of monks. 
Professor Mohan Wijeratne in his Book on Buddha gives Katina as hard like a diamond.. How did Vas originate. It began with five monks who were on their way to meet Gauthama Buddha and just sixty kilometers away, they met with the hard rains.They then spent their time meditating and living together. After the rains they set about their objective to meet the Buddha and told him of their experiences and by traveling in the rain, they would be trampling other lives, both plant and animals. 
Buddha then instructed that they should refrain from traveling about during the rainy season and meditate. He also said that whenever it is possible to address the devotees for their deliverance. Then there were groups who were antagonistic to Buddha who criticized the travel of his disciples during the rainy season. This also led to instruct monks that during the rainy season they should curtail their movements. With this, Buddha advised all monks to perform Vas during the rainy seasonOn the other hand the monks who had observed Vas prepare with the devotees for the offering of the Katina robe. Should a monk fail to observe Vas on Esala Poya, then he is entitled to observe Pasu Vas, a day after Nikini poya, provided he retreats to the Poyage or the area which is reserved for monks to hold their ceremonies and meetings. 
Offering of the Katina robe is one, out of the eight meritorious acts that have been declared by Buddha. 
I set about to a small village on the outskirts of the Hantane range just a few days before Il poya to find out how the ritual is been enacted. 
Offering of the Katina Cheevaraya by the devotees
The temple was full of villagers in their best for the occasion and everyone of them were with an Atapirikara to be offered to the monks who have been in retreat or Vas After the cloth for the processing of the Katina Cheevaraya is brought from the place it had been kept overnight, it is then cut according to a plan set about by Buddha. The Katina Cheevaraya is according to the plan of paddy fields of king Bimbisara. But, the cloth at that time was taken from cemeteries, where the practice was to leave the dead in forests. From these covered cloths of dead bodies, the cloth was brought, stitched and then made into a Cheevaraya. 
After the Cheevaraya was stitched, it is dyed in a pandu oruwa or a receptacle made out of a log for the specific purpose of dying the Cheevaraya. 
After the Cheevaraya or robe is dried it is brought with all the pomp and ceremony into the area where it is offered to the monks who have assembled to appoint a monk to receive the Katina Cheevaraya.
The greatest asset of a monk who had received Higher Ordination or Upasampada is the calling for Vas during his life time
The Katina Cheevarya is then offered to the monks by the devotees by holding the open robe. 
This then does not mean that the Katina Cheevara should be offered to the very monk who had observed Vas or Retreat during the period. After the Cheevaraya or robe is offered to the monks, then it is their duty to select a monk from the congregation or even from outside to offer the Katina Cheevaraya. 
Once the Katina Cheevaraya is in the hands of the monks in congregation, then the final ceremony commences for the offering of the Katina robe. 
The robe is then held by two Senior monks and then again it is offered to the congregation of monks. They in turn discuss as to whom the Cheevaraya  should be offered. After their decision, the monk in question is offered the robe by the most senior monk, to the recipient. 
The recipient monk, then goes through a process, and in his stanzas he says that the Cheevaraya would be with him and he will touch it daily and be the third robe, as allowed by Buddha. 
The robe is then marked by him with a key, having kept a betel leaf over the key so that a mark would be left to recognise the  Katina Cheevaraya  over theother robes. 
Thus then ends the Katina offering.

The message is the medium here
	
As Sri Lankas made-by-politicians political imbroglio entered its fourth week with no end in sight, the UNP suddenly decided to write to Mark Zuckerberg, the head at Facebook. 
The letter that was sent over the weekend said - It is very likely that officials from the current illegal administration...may ask Facebook for information on selected Sri Lankan users of that particular social media platform that should rightfully be private. Such requests may include information on named individuals, geo locations and other identification details of users who view and post on these pages.
Since March riots, Facebook has been paying increased attention onSri Lanka
	Ordinary citizens have also taken to social media to express their disgust
Those of us who have been watching social media even before the current political turbulence felt that the letter was a preemptive move by the UNP. There was no indication that Facebook was contemplating releasing such data and even by mid-week, the letter went unacknowledged. But what has been true is that Facebook and other such social media have opened up another dimension in the ongoing efforts to gain public attention and then monopolize the information arch. Facebook has been in the forefront as the platform that was allowing all parties concerned to get content into the public domain. 
On Monday, when the public galleries of parliament were closed off, there were also fears that journalists would come under heightened security when they tried to use their mobiles from the press section. Journalists cannot use their mobiles from the gallery but some have been using them during the last few sessions. And if the official live feed were to be cut off, then there would be no way the general public would get access to what was going on within the chamber. But when sessions started those who wanted, were getting pictures that were as close as you could get to parliamentary sessions  from within the members areas.

Recent double crossover, Manusha Nanayakkara, used his Facebook page to go live from within the chamber. On the first day when fracas broke out, then again it was a Facebook live feed of media outlet, this time done from the gallery, that I used as my main source to witness what was taking place. Facebook was also being used by the political parties, journalists and others to live stream interviews, press-conferences and other incidents during the crisis.

There are around six million Sri Lankan origin Facebook accounts and since the March riots, Facebook has been paying increased attention on Sri Lanka.
Twitter still remains a selective domain. It is still a niche platform but an important platform for news makers, influential individuals and others. Information, rumour and pure lies get shared here instantaneously and when it works well, they get verified and crowd sourced. 
The other main platform that seems to be heavily used is Whatsapp, to share, verify tips, news and rumour. The danger with social media is its potency to go viral and the ease with which it allows for fake content. The other danger is that computed influence pedalling when bots can be used to boost content, troll and harass. During the ongoing crisis there has been no significant use of bots boost content or personalities. But there have been marked developments. 
In the past the social media community that had Mahinda Rajapaksa as the nucleus dominated the Sri Lanka social media sphere, especially, that relating to political or related content. With October 26 take-over, we have seen a much more pluralized and diversified field with UNP, JVP and other parties also realizing the importance of social media. 
Ordinary citizens have also taken to social media to express their disgust at what was going on and they have been quite open. The memes have the best antidepressant for the political mess.

## Title: THIS  COUNTRY IS NOT THEIRS TO RUIN

THIS  COUNTRY IS NOT THEIRS TO RUIN
	
The events that unfolded on October 26 have led the country towards unprecedented instability. Almost a month later, we are still awaiting the correct interpretation of the decisions and the credibility of actions while pondering if such changes have been made in the best interest of the country and her people and if the society accepts them with knowledge and understanding.
It is no secret that the shock waves that went through the country on October 26 were immense. Usually the appointment of a Prime Minister is a well-planned, laborious and glamorous event, but this one was like a couple eloping in the night. It was a slap on the face of everyone who clearly rejected the previous regime. What led to this sudden appointment of a Prime Minister nobody seems to know. But the fundamental question that is asked from all quarters is whether there was justification coupled with moral and ethical grounds on which decisions were made.
Our society is more vibrant and vociferous and the effects of this are seen through social media. The messages reach the other end of the earth. So things do not remain contained within the country. The chaos that followed the October 26 swearing in has once again brought discredit to the country.
The Yahapaalana Government was established with much hope by a large majority that was tired of the regime before. The promises were that those who have misused public funds will be brought to book, there will be an end to impunity and the freedom of the press will be restored. To some degree the people believed that the President was keen. But much too soon the bond issue gave ammunition to the MPs within the Opposition to fire at the Good Governance Government. Sadly the advise I gave the President to cancel the famous bond auction immediately was not heeded. As a result, till today no action or a proper inquiry has taken place. In addition the joint opposition did nothing but act as the spanner in the works. They created havoc in many corners to disrupt the Government and the daily life of the citizens.
Steps in the right direction
It is obvious that the country lacked systems to address the various financial scandals. When the FCID was set up, many, including some SLFP Ministers in the Government were against it. It was a legitimate process that had to go through a court of law. It was a step in the right direction. Then the fast track/hybrid courts were established and the same stalwarts were criticising it. Why Did they think that they will be victims of it
At the bottom of this, the rulers were divided. So it was a sorry state of affairs.
But the Government did many significant things during the past three years. The establishment of a free ambulance service, reduction of medicine prices, regained GSP Plus, bringing in the Right to Information Act and the right to free speech, re establishing the independent commissions and even bringing the 19th Amendment to the Constitution which of course at this juncture seems a mockery according to the legal luminaries waxing eloquent on electronic media .
What prompted the President to appoint a new Prime Minister after 3 years and 2 months of a Coalition Government Many are of the view that having so and so as a premier is a continuation of the ailment, but appointing another (the way he did) is not the cure. There is a saying in Sinhala that goes changing the pillow to cure a headache which means that without addressing the root cause an ineffective remedial measure is taken. Once you accept public office you are responsible for your actions and are accountable to the public. One fine day you will have to face the consequences. While we do not know on whose advice the President is taking these actions; right now his actions are being questioned my many . When we look at this new Cabinet what many people say is  Horu allanna aanduwak aawa; eeta passe horu aanduwa alluwa. Now it appears that no one is steering the ship which is in troubled waters and the President is rearranging the furniture in the ship. What is worrying is that the bureaucracy has come to a halt because they are struggling to comprehend what is going on.
What were the reasons behind proroguing parliament And why not appoint someone as PM from within the coalition government He claims that he asked a few people individually if they would like to take on the Premiership. But is that the best course of action. While the whole country waits for the Supreme Court decision on the dissolution of Parliament; the question that has arisen is whether it was morally and ethically right for the President to do so According to the 19th Amendment, the Parliament cannot be dissolved before 4 and a half years. With utmost respect to the Judiciary, the interpretation of the Law has to be based on what the framers of the law had in mind when they passed the law . In that context it is abundantly clear on the 4 1/2 year rule .
Terrifying domino effect
From the time this article was first penned, so much has happened. The actions of the President has had a terrible and terrifying domino effect and the entire country is in absolute chaos now. Hardly any action is taking place in Government offices. The officials are in a dither as to whose instructions they are to follow. I cannot imagine the stress that the parliamentary staff and the ministry secretaries are experiencing during this chaos. There is no Cabinet and it also shows that we do not need one.
The dissolution of parliament in 2003 by President Chandrika Kumaratunga was a similar decision which she regretted later. Both Mahinda Rajapaksa and Maithripala Sirisena became Presidents of this Country thanks to former President Chandrika. But we see no gratitude being shown by either one. What the President has done has indeed given oxygen to the UNP which was in a bad wicket due to the bond scam.
While all this is happening locally, the image of the country in the international arena has reached a new low. We are now a good example of a badly managed economy in the Asian region. The president and the law makers do not seem to realize that the world does not accept this. A letter from the Secretary General of the UN has insisted that action be taken as per the Constitution. Who we elect as the President should be knowledgeable of the constitution and the power and the authority that post grant. The people expect that person to act with utmost integrity. If the actions of the President are being widely questioned by the average person on the street to the most learned, then it is time to realise that the President has made a fundamental mistake. If the President was ill advised, it is time to leave aside the egos and take remedial measures. I for a moment do not think that you can bring a no confidence motion against the PM now, simply because he has not served even for 2 weeks. what one can bring is a motion that the present PM does not command or have the support of the majority in Parliament.
This country is not theirs to ruin. We owe it to the future generations to safeguard this country right now.

TNA urges intervention of diplomats to solve crisis situation in SL
	
The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) had urged the diplomats in a meeting held yesterday to use their influence with whoever necessary to set things right and put the country in the right path, Tamil National Alliance (TNA) leader R. Sampanthan said.
The TNA had a meeting at the Opposition Leader's office with the fifteen members of diplomate community to discuss matters pertaining to the prevailing political crisis which initially started on October 26 this year. Diplomats from US, UK, Canada, Norway, Switzerland, EU, India, Korea, Bangladesh participated in the meeting.
Addressing the media after the meeting, he said they discussed how the then Prime Minister was removed, how the new prime minister was purportedly appointed, how Parliament was prorogued and dissolved and interim order of the Supreme Court suspending the dissolution of Parliament.
The purportedly appointed Premier has not yet obtained a confident vote in parliament and proved majority in parliament despite various steps to secure majority," said TNA leader.
He said two motions of no confidence were passed in Parliament on two separate dates and subsequently, the steps taken to submit the signed documents of 122 members to the Speaker which then transmitted to Parliament and the President.
It seems that the purportedly appointed Premier and the Government continue to function and eventually it would create turbulence in the country, Sampanthan said.
The entire procedure into this has been done in violation of the Constitution and the law of the country. This a serious situation and thats why we urge the diplomates to bring this dangerous situation into the knowledge of the responsible bodies so that there would an end to this state of affairs, he added.

TO SERVE OR BE SERVED
	
Our country stands on the brink of adversity, power hungry politicians have destroyed democracy and the highest in the land has descended to lower than the lowest!!! Nothing is worse than allowing a persona non grata to enter the place of power; because they use the power to empower themselves, they say they are trying to stamp out corruption and destroy the spirit of selfishness but they are not!!!
SERVICE IS THE GREATEST ASPECT OF LEADERSHIP
Leadership is not measured by how many people SERVE YOU; it is measured by how many people YOU SERVE!!! Service is the greatest act of leadership; serving the people is why you exist!!! So, any time you want to be served, that is the parasite and it is like a cancer that comes from within!!! It is the highest manifestation of insecurity!!! King Solomon the Great once said Woe to the land when a slave becomes King, what he was saying was the country will be destroyed if the person who is in power thinks like a slave, one who has been stripped of everything, so they want everything for themselves!!!
EXECUTIVE PRESIDENCY - A SCOURGE
The biggest scourge that our country faces today is the curse of the EXECUTIVE PRESIDENCY!!! We have to unite unanimously to abolish the scourge of the Executive Presidency, which is the root cause of the political cancer that is destroying our country today!!! In the context of todays political situation, I had some 1982 news coverage sent to me by a friend!!! JRs Lessons and Colvins Prediction!!! The 1982 Presidential Election was covered for The Island by the late Ajith Samaranayake and another reporter. Apparently, among JRs contenders were Hector Kobbekaduwa and Dr. Colvin R. de Silva. Ajith and the other reporter had to brief the outcome of the electoral results to their Chairman Upali Wijewardene, who stayed alert on that night at his residence, in Thurstan Road, Colombo.
True to Colvins words, President Premadasas UNP split. President Kumaratungas SLFP split, and today, President Mahinda Rajapaksas SLFP is also in the doldrums

Well, JR won! Both reporters were relaxing in the porch, when Anandatissa arrived. While chatting to Anandatissa, JR alighted from his Jaguar with a smile. Anandatissa said, Sir, you have won in a convincing manner. JR responded saying Thats why Ananda I am here. Seconds later another car followed. It was Dr. Colvin R. de Silva. Alighting from his car, Colvin called Dickie, Dickie JR looked back and said, Hi Colvin, happy to see you. No, Dickie, I only came to wish you on your victory, said Colvin and walked up to JR to shake hands, JR invited him into the main hall but, Colvin turned it down and while returning to his car, Colvin again said Dickie, I must tell you something. JR asked what it was. Colvin replied Dickie, the day you go, abolish this executive system and go, because your successors will find it difficult to keep their political parties united unlike you, and when that happens, there will be chaos in the country. Thats a matter for the future to see, like Que Sera JR had quipped in lighter vein. Colvin responded What I say will be, will be, and boarded his car. True to Colvins words, President Premadasas UNP split. President Kumaratungas SLFP split, and today, President Mahinda Rajapaksas SLFP is also in the doldrums. A more accurate prediction was never made!!!
Serving people is an honour; not a lucrative career for looting
In keeping with what Sajith Premadasa very eloquently said, Parliamentarians should adhere to the following:
a) Parliamentarians should NOT get Pension since it is NOT employment but Election under Peoples Representation Act, it has no retirement with bar on re-employment but they can get reelected to the same position again. Currently they get pension after 5 years of service.
b) Parliamentarians pay should be revised in line with Central Pay Commission. They increase/raise their salary arbitrarily by voting for themselves.
c) Parliamentarians should lose their current health care system and participate in the same health care system as the general public of Sri Lanka.
d) All concessions like free travel, ration, electricity, water, phone bill should be abolished.
e) Parliamentarians with tainted records, criminal charges and convictions, past or present should be summarily banned from Parliament and contesting election on any pretext. Financial losses incurred due to politicians in office must be recovered from their families, nominees or properties.
f) Parliamentarians should equally abide by all laws they impose on the general public.
g) No surrender of subsidies such as LPG by citizens unless all subsidies available to MPs are withdrawn including subsidized food in Parliament canteen.
h) Once they are elected, they should remain in the same party and ability to crossover should be totally abolished.
Serving in Parliament is an honour; not a lucrative career for looting!!! After all, they claim that they come to serve the people, so serve the people, and they must!!!
Sajith very correctly said that the Ministers should pay attention to the homeless, starving people of this country!!!
THE DEATH OF DEMOCRACY IS GOING TO TAKE AWHILE!!!

UNP to form broad political alliance
	
The United National Party (UNP) is reportedly planning to form a broad electoral alliance with like-minded political parties and under the leadership of a 10-member council.
Preliminary negotiations have been completed at the moment with the Jathika Hela Urumya (JHU), the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC), All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC) and the Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) joining with the UNP to form this new political front.
According to reports several Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) members are expected to throw their weight behind this political alliance at the behest of former president Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.
Former ministers Rajitha Senaratne and Arjuna Ranatunga will join the alliance as a separate entity and when formed, the new alliance is hoping to invite the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and civil society organizations.
The parties have identified the diamond as the most desired symbol for this proposed alliance when facing elections in the future.
There is no final agreement on the symbol. But, the diamond seems to be the most desired symbol, a source said. (Kelum Bandara)

UNP to hold series of protests and death fast
	
The United National Front (UNP) and its allies have decided to hold a series of protests and a death fast against what it called an unconstitutional instate of a new government, UNP General Secretary Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said yesterday.
He told a media briefing that the UNF and its allies would stage a protest in Kandy on November 24, in Kalutara on November 27, in Colombo on December 3 and at Kiribathgoda on December 4 2018.
Mr. Kariyawasam said state officers who approved spending for the new ministers would have to be answerable for their illegal acts. There is no legal value for the spending carried out by the ministries as there is no government at the moment as announced by the Speaker, he said.
UNP MP Ajith P Perera said the trade unions and professionals allied to the UNF would hold a Sathyagraha at the Vihara Maha Devi Park today and would be converted to a death fast if the need arises.
Defending the decision to submit a motion to stop the expenditure head of new Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, Mr. Perera said it was fully legal as it is Parliament which has the power over all spending as per Article 148 of the Constitution.
Minister Wimal Weerawansa has challenged us to show majority support and we asked for an appointment from President to do so. However, we have not been allowed to show the majority in the form of affidavits and our physical presence, Mr. Perera said. (Yohan Perera)
