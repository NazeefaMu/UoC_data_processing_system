A case of brazen discrimination!
	

A Diyawanna government politico had recently launched a vocational training programme for housewives in her constituency enabling them to engage in an economically productive activity during their spare time.

However, when a group of women from the area called at the Diyawanna members office seeking enrolment in a vocational training course, the members of politicos private staff handling the project had refused to take them in for the course saying that the programme was open only to party supporters, they say.
The women had argued that as the training programme was to be conducted utilizing public funds, they had no right to discriminate against any section on grounds of race, religion or political bias.
However, the politicos aides and his henchmen present at the place had turned away the women saying, The question of whose monies are going to fund this programme does not concern us. What matters to us is the Madams orders not to recruit for any of these training courses anyone outside our political party. And we know that you all are supporters of a rival party!

A partial Solar Eclipse on August 11
	
Eclipses 3
A partial Solar eclipse will occur in the 3rd quarter of Aslisa constellation in the Zodiacal sign of Cancer (Makara) on Saturday August 11.
The greatest eclipse will occur at 15.16 hours on August 11. It will be visible only from the Northernmost parts of the world. The 3rd eclipse for the year 2018, this is to come on the heels of the total Lunar eclipse that occurred on July 27/28. In fact, a Solar eclipse always occurs about two weeks before or after a Lunar eclipse; in this instance, after a Lunar eclipse. 
According to the ancient Indian Rishis it is inauspicious to start any important event in life or embark on any plan or program for that matter on the day of a Solar or Lunar eclipse and during the three days both preceding and following the day of the eclipse counting a total of seven days.
It is also the general opinion of the savants of Astrology that it is inauspicious to commence any important event or plan during the running of either the Zodiacal sign or the constellation in which the eclipse occurs either on the day of the eclipse or within the seven days preceding or the following the day of the eclipse which add up to 15 days.

Bandara Ekanayake: A lotteries collector  supporting social welfare
	

Some people buy lotteries as a habit while several others to try their luck. Many start their daily routine only after purchasing lotteries. Basically, lotteries are as important as the morning cup of coffee. 
Out of a thousand lottery buyers is an interesting character whose life is closely-knit with this art. His collection includes lotteries issued from the very inception of theLotteries Board. He can be introduced as E.M.D. Bandara Ekanayake, a retired postmaster residing at Dolahena in Kalawana. Explaining his connection with lotteries, Mr. Ekanayake expressed the following to our sister-weekly, Deshaya:
I began purchasing national and development lotteries since the very inception of the Lotteries Board in 1962. Back then, the price of a lottery ticket was Fifty cents and only Rs.100,000 was given to the winner. Before that, I purchased lotteries printed on behalf of the Industrial Exhibition in 1959. I have collected all lotteries I purchased over the years. Earlier, there were no lottery stalls in Kalawana, so I had to travel by bus or send someone else to Sinniah Stores in Nivithigala to purchase lotteries. In the past, lotteries were sold at Ranasinghe Hotel, owned by P.D.T. Lathpandura in Kalawana. It is from there that I have been purchasing lotteries. My children continue this legacy. Although I havent won more than Rs.10,000 from lotteries, I keep buying them to contribute to the Lotteries Board that renders public services such healthcare and education. Similarly, I help people in whatever way possible. I have built a community hall in my village, he said. 
Not only is Mr. Ekanayake a collector of lotteries, he also collects bus tickets and newspapers.

## Title: Book launch : Maha Nuwara Yugaye Aprakata Viththi
## Section: News Features

Book launch : Maha Nuwara Yugaye Aprakata Viththi
	
The book, the title of which translates to Little Known Facts of the Kandyan Period, is an impressive two-volume publication (Palawana Veluma and Dewana Veluma) containing over five hundred illustrations.
Some illustrations are being made public for the first time. Among the illustrations are pictures of the oldest Sri Lankan gun dating back to 1580, the largest Kodi Tuwakku in the country, the gun of King Rajasinghe II and the oldest cannon used by the Sinhalese Army dating back to the 1700s. There is also a picture of a gun of Sri Lankan origin called the King of All Guns which is now in a museum in the USA.
Other illustrations include battle maps and sketches which have not been previously published. Two such pictures that might be of immense interest to the public are a picture from the Netherlands dating from 1766 of the Kandyan Army on parade and a map of the City of Kandy drawn by the Dutch during the invasion of 1765.
According to the author, the book is the culmination of more than ten years of research based on manuscripts available locally and from sources abroad. The main focus is on the facts extracted from them.
Some contents of the book would be truly fascinating to readers.
Among them are the horoscopes of King Sri Wickrema Rajasinghe, His Queen (Rengammal), Ehelepola Kumarihamy, and Veera Puran Appu. Also in the publication are details of the history of the Sangakkara family to which Cricketer Kumar Sangakkara belongs.
Therefore, without a doubt, the majority of the general readership ought to find this publication informative and interesting.
Taking yet another interesting turn, the book also has a chapter on Nittevo- considered as a kind of primitive man or ape believed to have been exterminated by the Veddas about 250 years ago.
Although this is to be considered an academic or scholarly piece of work, the author has attempted to keep the language simple and easy for the general readership, while maintaining its academic nature.
The final result is a work that is expected to be a reference work that will stimulate interest in this kind of research and will function as a source-book for future researchers. It is also expected that any general reader will find it interesting, stimulating and a pleasure to read.
Author Chamikara Pilapitiya, through his family links, appears to be very well placed to execute this kind of research since a substantial portion of the sources is not accessible without the right credentials. A former rugby football player and a keen participant in motor sports, both as a rider and a driver, Chamikara has in the last decade devoted all the time he could spare from his current occupation in the tea trade and family commitments to this research.
The fact that this book is packed with such a large amount of researched detail means that it would not come as a surprise if this triggers many others to research their own areas of interest, keeping this book as a foundation.
This book is the first one of a trio written by the author. The other titles expected to follow this publication are The History of Sri Lankan Firearms and The Secret Tunnels of Sri Lanka.

A book titled the Little Known Facts of the Kandyan Period written by Chamikara Pilapitiya would be launched today (3) at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute (SLFI) by the author.

Breaking free from substance abuse
	

Individuals tackle lifes obstacles in different ways. Some individuals may succeed in clearing the hurdle while others wouldnt. Those who are associated with substance abuse fail to cope up with what life has to offer them. This is the reason behind many broken families, crimes and of course unhappy lives. However it is never too late to break the chain of this vicious cycle created by substance abuse. On the positive side there is always hope and help.Dr. Jayamal De Silva, Consultant Psychiatrist at the Colombo South Teaching Hospital, Kalubowila and Senior Lecturer in Psychiatry, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Sri Jayawardenepuraand Dr. Udena Attygalle, Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist, shed light on the issue of substance abuse and how to get around it, minimizing the damage caused by such use and how to prevent people from falling victim to it. 
Adopting population measures that are scientifically proven to be effective economically as well as socially will prove to be more strongly effective in dealing with and minimizing substance abuse rather than other options such as medications, legal measures like punishments, counselling and rehabilitation in the long-run. This will help prevent the diversion of the necessary services and resources on less effective alternatives and approach the issue at hand directly to ensure better results,says Dr. Jayamal De Silva

It is important for parents to inculcate life skills in children so that they can be assertive when the necessity arises and not be influenced by negativity that may surround them
Alcohol and tobacco
Substance abuse takes many forms. It includes the consumption of hard drugs such as nicotine, heroin, etc as well as the consumption of substances such as alcohol and tobacco. Alcohol and tobacco are the major substances that contribute to the overall burden of drug abuse. 
Dr. De Silva explained that substance abuse is attributable to 2 major factors in the country; the economy and secondly the mortality. Recent studies have shown that the economic impact caused by alcohol alone is calculated in billions of rupees. Alcohol spearheads the cause behind as many as 25,000 deaths per year annually and tobacco comes close with roughly 20,000-25,000 deaths per year, he informed. Deaths due to hard drugs like heroin, do not come close to the mortality caused by alcohol and tobacco. This signifies its harmfulness although it is common to think of substances like heroin, etc on the topic of substance abuse.
It is needless to say that the use of hard drugs of course leads to devastating effects on the individual as well as the individuals family among other negative and adverse complications. 

Risk groups
The category of citizens that is most likely to be victimized by substance abuse comprise young adults. They are the future of the country. On viewing the future customer base, the young adults of the country are targeted by such markets. The coastal belt regions and the tourism sector are vulnerable areas connected with such markets. Therefore it is important to be both mindful and aware in order to take measures in preventing and reducing incidents of substance abuse, Dr. De Silva explicated.
On a positive note, tobacco smoking trends are seen to be reducing within the island. Slight drops in alcohol consumption can also be observed. Statistically speaking, it was estimated that while 40,000 heroin users existed in the mid 1980s in the island, currently there are approximately 50,000. Though it shows an increase, it is a subtle increase over the 25-30 years that have passed. This indicates some success of the control measures employed in reducing substance abuse, he added. The introduction of population measures, spreading public awareness, bans on public smoking, increase in prices and taxes, advertisement controls, targeting the bringing down of attraction around these substances and various other controls have played their parts in contributing to the reduction of substance abuse. 
However the general public should play a vital role as well if minimizing of substance abuse is to succeed. 

Our role as the public
Individuals fall victim to substance abuse through the concept of what is known as gateway drugs. It is through the gateway drugs that individuals get introduced to hard drugs which then leads to substance abuse. Gateway drugs include secondary smoking and beer which later aggravate into hard drug use. Therefore preventing exposure to these gateway drugs are extremely important, Dr. De Silva stressed.
In terms of behavioural changes, a change of perception is quite necessary.
The psychiatrist stressed on the fact that the public should change their ways on how they think about and perceive drugs. It is a commonly existing misconception that when a person takes drugs several times, that individual becomes a drug addict and is regarded so by the public. The individual himself, who took drugs once or twice, would think so and host thoughts of a ruined or doomed life. That is the nature of substance abuse. However just because a person uses drugs several times, it does not mean that the individual is beyond help or that his or her life is ruined, he explained. He continued further by adding that drug addiction is caused when the individual is exposed to such promotions constantly on a recurring basis.
It could be environmentally conduced or due to peer pressure. However it is important not to give up and think that life has been ruined. Addiction is caused by recurring exposure to drugs. The exposure to drugs a few times does not mean addiction. Help is available and there is hope for a healthy life, he stressed.
Factors that act as determinants of drug abuse should be addressed as well. Substance abuse is prevalent among the less affluent. Poverty and ignorance are factors that should be addressed in order to mitigate substance abuse successfully. 
According to Dr. De Silva, focusing on non-profitable measures can divert attention from the more effective measures in reducing drug abuse. Therefore it is important that people fully comprehend what has to be addressed specifically. Counselling and rehabilitation are the most followed methods by way of treatment. However its effectiveness depends on the individual. It may prove successful depending on the situation. Individuals with mild cases of substance abuse may benefit from above methods, but might not deal well with some. In some cases it may create negative affects and anger in the individual. There are situations when medication is needed to help deal with withdrawal symptoms when drug use is stopped. However total dependency on medication may obstruct the individuals ability to form skills of self adequacy, he accentuated. Self adequacy is important as the individual should be motivated to come out of drug addiction through effort and will power. 
He highlighted that it is of importance to direct attention towards strong implementation of population measures and stronger legislation and policies pertaining to substance abuse controls.

Protect children
It is important for parents to inculcate life skills in children so that they can be assertive when the necessity arises and not be influenced by negativity that may surround them Dr. Udena Attygalle said.
Since children and adolescents become easy targets of such situations, parents play an important role in protecting them and preparing them to face life sensibly so they do not fall victim to substance abuse when life tests them by throwing obstacles in their path. 
Dr. Attygalle stated that parents have to be sensitive and aware of their children and keep up with what is going on in their lives. If there is a problem, parents have to deal with the issue in a sensitive manner. Furthermore, it is important for parents to inculcate life skills in children so that they can be assertive when the necessity arises and not be influenced by negativities that may surround them often by way of peers, he mentioned. Dr. Attygalle continued to explain that these skills should be developed within children in such a way that they should be able to deal with tough situations while maintaining and keeping friendships intact. 
Both males and females are vulnerable to drug abuse, but males are more exposed to sociocultural issues that contribute to drug abuse. However it is hard to generalise this issue and this does not mean that females are out of danger of falling victim to drug abuse. Equal care has to be taken regarding females.
Prevention is always the better option than cure, so more attention has to be paid to avoid incidents associated with substance abuse. However it is important to remember that help is always available and there is always hope for individuals fallen victim to substance abuse. An individual should never give up by resorting to thoughts that one is beyond help. Where theres life, theres always hope!

## Title: Can we abolish Year Five Scholarship Exam

Can we abolish Year Five Scholarship Exam
	


The Grade Five Scholarship examination has become a debated topic in Sri Lankas educational system. Some have strong views that this examination must be abolished in order to relieve students and parents of undue pressure. However, its important to analyse both the advantages and disadvantages that this examination brings. Its this writers belief that academics have a moral obligation to share their views about this controversial topic. Even last week, an article on this topic was published in the Daily Mirror. 
In Sri Lanka, there are about 9,904 schools, of which 335 are national schools. About 36 of these academic institutes are labelled most popular schools (e.g. Joseph Stalin, CTU,). The Grade Five Scholarship examination provides an opportunity to gifted and talented students to gain admission into these popular schools. Students from rural or remote locations and those coming from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds depend on this examination to provide them with the opportunity of realising their dreams of gaining admission to such academic institutes. 
Need for distinct teaching styles
Research reveals that, based on learning ability, students can be pooled into two groups  fast learners and slow learners. It is always better to categorise students on this basis and teach them separately, as both groups require distinct teaching styles. When both groups of students are combined, this could demotivate the students and adversely affects their academic performances. This scholarship examination helps to identify the learning ability of students and teach them in the most effective manner. 
Scholarship examinations are not restricted to Sri Lanka. For example, in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, the State Government conducts the Selective School Examination in Grade Six, where students compete for a place across 19 Fully Selective and 29 Partially Selective schools, where they will complete their Secondary Education. Although this examination is administered and assessed in a slightly different manner, the overarching purpose is very similar to the Sri Lankan equivalent. 
Despite these advantages, it is undeniable that there are several issues that need to be addressed. It is becoming increasingly evident that the Grade Five Scholarship Examination brings stress upon students. In addition to school hours, students preparing for this examination spend long hours at coaching centres. Some parents send their children to multiple coaching centres, in an often misguided effort, to boost their chances of success. Students may attend back-to-back classes, as they manage their increasingly busy schedules. During this time, the participation of students in extra-curricular activities, such as sport, music, reading and social activities, is severely restricted, or eliminated at worst. Students are left both physically and mentally exhausted, and deprived of the ability to enjoy their childhood, or unwind from the increasing pressure applied on them. 
Parents cite many reasons to support their decision to send their children to coaching centres. Parents and students have an incorrect perception that if their child is not successful at this examination, they have a bleak, or no, future. This misguided perception is worsened by the competitive tension among students, and worse, parents. However, there is no signi<U+FB01>cant evidence to support any positive correlation between the performance at the Grade Five Scholarship Examination and future academic performance or career prospects. Social stigma has led to this examination to gain elevated importance. This leads to what can only be described as a vicious self-perpetuating cycle  where the society believes that this examination is extremely important. Therefore parents want their children to pass it at any cost. As a result, parents place immense pressure on children to succeed in this examination, thereby giving this examination the same importance as other exams that drive their actions. 
In Asian cultures, most parents send their children to coaching centres because they believe that education obtained at school is insufficient to pass competitive exams. Competition and comparison, both of which have deep roots in Asian cultures, also encourage this behaviour, and create a similar self-perpetuating cycle. 
Coaching centres
Parents are continually looking for any means necessary to give their children a competitive advantage over others. Coaching centres are considered the best place to obtain this competitive advantage. These centres emphasise how to prepare children for examinations. Most of the time student attending sessions at these centres are spoon-fed. When students pass this exam their efforts add to the centres name thus ensuring <U+FB01>nancial success. 
Examinations that focus on evaluating rote learning will continue to encourage this coaching centre culture, as parents will forever believe that education obtained in school will never be enough to succeed at these examinations. If examinations were to redirect their focus on evaluating students critical thinking, analytical and problem-solving skills, then the additional value added by coaching centres over learning in the school environment would greatly diminish. Therefore, this will reduce the importance of coaching centres and in turn reduce mental and physical pressures on students and parents. 

"In Asian cultures, most parents send their children to coaching centres because they believe that education obtained at school is insufficient to pass competitive exams"

For example, consider Finland, where students are given little to no homework in school, and private coaching centres are extremely scarce. There is no ranking of students, thereby diminishing competition. Every school has the same national goals, and has access to the same talent pool of university-trained teachers. As a result, inequality is eradicated  every Finnish child has an equal opportunity at obtaining the same quality education, no matter whether he or she lives, whether it be in a rural village or a university town. Finlands education system seeks to prepare children on how to learn,not how to pass examinations (Lyn Nell Hancock,2011). Focus has been shifted from a lifelong learning culture promoting learning for the sake of knowledge enrichment to learning for the sake of succeeding at examinations. This approach to education has resulted in Finland achieving 6th position in the Programme for International Student Assessment(PISA). 
As the saying goes, Rome wasnt built in a day  change is possible, however it will not happen overnight, and requires long-term planning, resources and commitment. As a short-term policy, eliminating the Grade Five Scholarship examination is an unthinkable task, however in the long-run it is possible with radical changes in Sri Lankas education system. By ensuring that our education system promotes learning beyond passing examinations, to learning to sustain personal and professional development  deep seeded cultural values and the importance given to certain examinations as milestones, can be changed. This will help to alleviate the physical and mental burdens placed on both students and parents, ensuring that students maintain a healthy balance between academic and extra-curricular activities. Ultimately, this will ensure that present day students are adequately prepared to serve as the leaders of tomorrow  both on a national and global scale.

Chinese karaoke den near girls school raided for selling booze sans permit
	
A Chinese owned karaoke den cum restaurant in the close proximity to a leading girls school in Colombo 07, that did not bear a valid liquor permit was raided by Colombo Excise Station officials recently for selling liquor only to its Chinese customers.
The Excise officials following a probe based on information learnt that the Chinese karaoke restaurant had continued to sell alcoholic beverages since their Excise license was not renewed for 2018 over public displeasure owing to the place it is located.
According to Excise sources, the restaurant which is owned by a Chinese national couple settled in Sri Lanka has been continuing to sell liquor only to their Chinese customers in a discrete manner since the license was not renewed from January this year.
Although, the restaurant located close to the Pittala Junction is entertaining local guests the benefit of serving alcoholic beverages had been limited only to the Chinese customers, who were mainly attracted from Chinese expatriate community that engage in Colombo Port City projects, the Excise sources said.
Since this was the case, it had been tricky for the Excise sleuths to send an undercover agent inside the said restaurant as non Chinese nationals were served liquor.
However, following a lengthy probe the Colombo Excise Station officials managed to arrest the local employee in charge of the bar of the restaurant in the act of issuing liquor and up on inquiry had failed to produce a valid permit.
OIC Colombo Excise Station Chief Inspector Chanaka Nanayakkara is conducting investigations with Excise Inspector Indralal Mahawatte and Excise Guards Hemantha Dissanayake, Lahiru Kodagoda, Nilantha Rajapaksa and Nihal Perera on the instructions of Assistant Excise Commissioner B. A. Dayaratne (Western Province) and Excise Superintendent Colombo Vijitha Gamanayake.
The sleuths also seized 121 cans of beer from the restaurant stocks. The arrested employee had been released on Excise bail and would be produced before the Maligakanda Magistrate today along with the seized stock of liquor. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

## Title: Facts and myths about fat and starch

Facts and myths about fat and starch
	

When it comes to heart attack the main contributing factors for this condition have been either stroke, being overweight or obese. The culprit for all these factors has been fat. However this isnt the absolute truth. Most of us, particularly the ones who have suffered heart attacks, strokes and have higher blood cholesterol fear consuming fat. Let me brief the readers on the importance of consuming fat to enjoy a healthy life and clarify some misunderstanding about fat and carbohydrates (starch). For this purpose we spoke to Dr K T Sundaresan who is a Senior Lecturer at the Faculty of Health Care Sciences in the Eastern University, Sri Lanka and a Honorary Consultant Physician at the Teaching Hospital in Batticaloa and a UN Physician (Eastern Province of Sri Lanka).

Good fats
The following are considered as good fats which and have many health benefits which includes protecting the heart and brain from heart attacks and strokes. 
Omega 3 fatty acids: It is a type of good fat called poly unsaturated fatty acid. It is very popular in the western world. They are necessary for human health, but the body cant produce them. You have to get them through food. Omega-3 fatty acids are found in fish, such as salmon, tuna and nuts such as almond nuts, sesame seed and flax seeds. 
There are several other good polyunsaturated fats and monounsaturated fats (another type of good fat) found in Avocado (Butter fruit), cashew nuts and peanuts etc. 
The above mentioned fats (polyunsaturated including omega 3 fat and mono unsaturated fat) without doubt are important fats to keep healthy our heart, brain and joints and to prevent heart attacks, strokes and several cancers. 

Bad fat
Let us look at the bad cholesterol. The below mentioned fats need to be completely avoided as they cause cholesterol deposition in the blood vessels (atherosclerosis) of the heart, brain and other parts of the body which lead to heart attacks and strokes. 
Any food that contains or is labelled as hydrogenated fat or partially hydrogenated or trans-fat must be avoided. These are often present in man-made fat. For commercial purposes the liquid vegetable oil is converted to hard solid fat by hydrogenation. This is done to extend the shelf life of the food and give them flavour. Examples of food that contain these fat are margarines, fast foods, certain baked foods, some coffees creams, frozen pizzas and fried food Dr. Sundaresan added. 
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of United States has already taken steps to ban the Trans fatty acids by 2018 after realizing its contributions to heart disease. The FDA states that by banning trans-fat, as many as 20,000 heart attacks and 7000 deaths can be prevented each year in America. The Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine in Sri Lanka too has taken steps to reduce the trans fatty acid consumption in the island. 

Controversies regarding fat
The following statements are based on research evidence and expert opinion. Readers should be critical when analyzing facts before accepting them. A type of fat that is termed saturated fat was considered as the major cause of heart diseases, strokes and many other diseases in the recent past. The following foods are examples of food which contain saturated fat; cows milk, butter, cheese, meat, egg etc. In fact after analyzing many studies, scientists affirm that saturated fat being a cause of heart disease is only a hypothesis and not supported by concrete proof. This type of fat increasing cholesterol in the blood and high cholesterol in turn raising the risk of heart diseases is not a well proven hypothesis he said. 
The most important first comprehensive study done in1950s by biochemist Ancel Keys on fat was highly manipulated to prove the above theory. When the investigator analyzed the total fat consumption and heart diseases in 22 countries, he noticed that there were countries such as Holland and Norway which had a higher consumption of fat with decreased incidences of heart attacks. A country like Chile has a decreased fat consumption, but has seen an increase in heart attacks. 
He purposefully and unethically removed these countries in his studies to prove his theory. The recent study done in 18 countries taking into account more than 100,000 people in all 5 continents, concluded that higher the consumption of carbohydrates higher the deaths due to various diseases. It was also observed that the higher the fat (including saturated fat) consumption lesser the deaths. Again we need to be very cautious in interpreting this study too! 
USA (FDA) after realising that the culprit is mainly carbohydrate and some other fat such as trans-fat and not saturated fat- as there is no proven link between cholesterol and heart attack- has taken action in removing the restriction of daily cholesterol consumption. It seems that the saturated fat is not harmful as we have thought before. 

Coconut oil
Coconut oil too was once considered as bad fat without there being definite evidence. It has a special type of saturated fat called medium chain fatty acid which has plenty of health benefits to the brain, heart, skin and so on. This oil also has some antibacterial and anti-fungal effects. I firmly believe that we need to consume more coconut oil and coconut milk. This is one of the best oils we have in our region. 
It seems that fat in cows milk, butter and cheese too may not be harmful. It may have many health benefits. Do you know that human breast milk also contains saturated fat 
It is also a myth that the consumption of fat causes weight gain. Interestingly many studies show that the reverse is true that it helps to reduce weight. Mainly the starch or carbohydrate causes weight gain. The excess starch is converted into fat in the body and stored beneath the skin and other organs. Further it may help in forming the cholesterol deposits in the blood vessels (atherosclerosis).
It seems that lesser the carbohydrate and higher the good fat is a better combination for a healthy life said Dr.Sundaresan. Even though this article discusses mainly fat and carbohydrate, the most crucial diet component such as vitamins, minerals and a special micro-nutrient called phytonutrients- in green leafy vegetables, other vegetables, nuts and fruits- should not be ignored. These foods prevent many deaths due to heart diseases, strokes, cancers and several other non-communicable diseases.

Fat and cholesterol are essential
Fat and cholesterol are important structural components of the cell wall of all human beings.
Cholesterol plays an important role in the synthesis of several vital hormones namely sex hormones such as oestrogen, progesterone, testosterone and other hormones such as aldosterone, vitamin D and so on. Cholesterol is important to have a healthy brain and nerves. It is impossible to live without cholesterol or fat. Most of the cholesterols are produced by our liver Dr. Sundaresan. 
Before looking at the controversies associated with fat let us discuss about good and bad fat accepted universally and backed by research evidence.

## Title: Indo-Lanka Accord :  DEAD LETTER
## Section: Opinion
## Date: 3 August 2018 02:19 am
Indo-Lanka Accord :  DEAD LETTER
	


	India never stood for the Sri Lankan Tamils rights or aspirations. It had stood for its own interests
	
	
	
	A deep-rooted perception the devolution of power amounted to a division of the country
	
	
	
	The Accord had practically laid the foundation for devolutionof power
	

hirty-one years ago, the first week of August 1987 saw a huge commotion especially in and around Colombo and also in some other parts of the country, with so many people being shot dead by the Police and the Armed forces.
It was a public agitation instigated by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) led by former Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) against the Indo-Lanka Accord signed on July 29, 1987.
The JVP led by its founder leader Rohana Wijeweera had then been proscribed by the J.R. Jayewardene Government under the pretext of instigating the anti-Tamil riots exactly four years ago, in 1983.
It had by then taken to arms after an unsuccessful three-year campaign for the lifting of the proscription on it and its entry into the agitations against the Indo-Lanka Accord gave a further violent twist to the crackdown by the law enforcement authorities.
The agitators were encouraged and thereby the situation was further aggravated by the media reports that Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa and National Security Minister Lalith Athulathmudali and Minister Gamani Jayasuriya were against the Accord.
Reports said that the three top leaders of the Government had boycotted the events related to the signing of the Accord and the visit by Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi for the signing ceremony.
Newspaper pages carrying the story that Prime Minister Premadasa was against the Accord were seen hanging on lamp posts and railings on either side of the road near the Bo Tree in Pettah, Colombo where a massive sit-in- protest organized by the JVP was on, with the participation of SLFP leader Mrs Bandaranaike, on the previous day of the signing of the Accord.
The agitations seemed to have had the support of the majority of people in Sinhalese dominated Southern areas as the Accord was seen as an instrument for the division of the country.


"Last year Indian Foreign Secretary S. Jaishanker had told EPRLF leader Suresh Premachandran that India would no longer press for the merger issue"


In fact, the Accord had practically laid the foundation for devolution of power through the creation of Provincial Councils and the concept of devolution had been in public discourse for the previous two years since the famous Thimpu Talks in June 1985.
A deep-rooted perception that the devolution of power amounted to the division of the country had by then been created especially by the Opposition among the majority of Sinhalese and it was this fear that made the Sinhalese public to rally round the agitators.
Reports on Police and the Armed Forces shooting dead many people came from around the country.
The JVP later put the tally as 147 in a poster campaign. In many places, the Government institutions were set ablaze by the rioters and people looted many institutions such as supermarkets.
Some Government buildings were burning for days.
Despite the anti-Accord agitations having subsided later the JVP kept the momentum of its armed struggle disguising as Deshapremi Janatha Vyaparaya (DJV) and introducing a new target, ousting of the Government of President Jayewardene, whom they called an Indian stooge.


"The EPDP has been the only entity in the world, not even India that stands persistently for the current PC system up to now"


It pathetically ended with more than 60,000 deaths at the hands of the Armed forces and various vigilante groups such as PRRA in November 1989.
This was how the Provincial Councils came to being exactly 31 years ago and this was the price the country had to pay for it.
Yet, the Accord and the resultant Provincial Councils have failed to achieve what they were meant for.
The stakeholders of the Accord openly had ignored their obligations under it.
The result was another 22 years of war which claimed another uncounted number of lives of soldiers, LTTE cadres, members of other Tamil groups and parties and civilians of all three communities. Some say it could be as many as 100,000.
Nevertheless, the Tamil leaders are still lamenting that their political aspirations are not fulfilled, indicating that they too are not satisfied with the provisions and the implementation of the Accord, despite them having supported it initially.
The Accord provided for the disarmament of the Tamil armed groups in Sri Lanka by India and Sri Lanka had to reciprocate by devolving power to the periphery  to the provincial councils  to a mutually acceptable level.
This included devolving of Police and Land Powers as well to the Provincial Councils.
Both the signatories of the Accord had failed, if not ignored to fulfil these obligations. India failed to disarm the LTTE, though it supported Sri Lankan Governments efforts to defeat the outfit while pressurizing the island to consider Tamil demands.
On the other hand, Sri Lanka not only failed but never wanted to implement fully the provisions of its own Constitution on devolution.
In fact, India never stood for the Sri Lankan Tamils rights or aspirations.
It had stood for its own interests when it armed, funded and militarily trained the Sri Lankan Tamil armed groups in the 1980s.
A staunch friend of the Soviet bloc during the Cold War era Prime Minister Ms Indira Gandhi wanted to teach a lesson to President J.R. Jayewardene for being then an ally of the US Bloc.
She also wanted to pacify Tamil Nadu; Indias southernmost State with a 50 million (Then) Tamil population, which was then agitated against Sri Lankas harsh crackdown on the Tamil rebel groups.
Her interest in the strengthening the Tamil armed groups and her son, Rajiv Gandhis interest in settling their southern neighbours ethnic conundrum towards the end of the Cold War have to be comprehended accordingly.
In spite of not being signatories, the Tamil armed groups had agreed to lay down arms and accept the Provincial Council system that was introduced under the Accord.
Many of them had been exhausted in fighting and on the verge of extermination at the hands of the LTTE then. However, now, except for the Eelam Peoples Democratic Party (EPDP) led by Douglas Devananda, those groups are also hunting for some other solution, which means their rejection of the current Provincial Council system.
The EPDP has been the only entity in the world, not even India that stands persistently for the current PC system up to now.
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) led by Velupillai Prabhakaran never agreed to the Accord or the resultant PC system. However, Prabhakaran was briefly and unofficially detained by Indian Authorities in Ashok Hotel in New Delhi prior to the signing of the Accord before he reluctantly agreed to the arrangement.
But, before long, he militarily challenged both countries after finding holes in the Accord and four years later made the very Accord lethal to the Indian Premier Rajiv Gandhi himself.
Indian leaders had been insisting on former President Mahinda Rajapaksas 13+ during the Rajapaksa regime.
But they no longer seem to be applying pressure on the Sri Lankan Government, as they did in the past; despite the fact that they are concerned over the intermittent Tamil Nadu upheavals.
And India has openly washed its hands off in respect of the merger of Northern and Eastern Provinces.
In February last year Indian Foreign Secretary S. Jaishanker had told EPRLF leader Suresh Premachandran that India would no longer press for the merger issue.
All in all, almost all stakeholders of the Indo- Lanka Accord by now have dumped it in the trash bin rendering it to be a dead letter, which can be revived only by India, if and when it wanted in the interest of it.

Is the gaffe a slip of the tongue
	

It is now well-known that the prison authorities are now ready with a list of 18 death row heroin convicts due to meet with imminent punishment according to an edict issued by Number One.

And this group condemned to imminent death is generally referred to as Daha-ate Kalliya (the clique of 18) these days.
By the way, the 16 Blue party dissidents who recently broke away from yahapalanaya to team up with the JO are generally referred to as the Dasaye Kalliya (the clique of 16).
There is a leading top team member in yahapalanaya who, they say, often mixes up the Daha-ate-Kalliya with the Dasaye Kalliya whenever he addresses a public event. While, on the subject of death penalty, this purohita would declare that the Dasaye Kalliya should be sent to gallows and at times a colleague seated close to him would whisper into his ear that he had mistakenly referred to the wrong Kalliya and then he would hasten to correct himself.
The gaffe this politico makes is generally considered as a serious slip of the tongue given his stance against the Group 16 is as much known as his advocacy of death for drug addicts!

Cancer is the 4th sign in the Zodiac governing the home and the domestic environment. Cancer subjects are attached to their homes and their native environment. They usually maintain a good rapport with their neighbors and the local community.
They have a great desire to go places and explore new frontiers despite their attachment to home.
Those born during the Cancer Solar month are moody and melancholy. They are endowed with the gift of intuition and clairvoyance. They often get a premonition of what is going to happen.
Cancer rules the stomach and Cancer subjects take a keen interest in cuisine and good foods.
Cancer people often suffer from emotional stress and strain. They are prone to diseases of the chest and the stomach. They are subject to bouts of melancholia and mental depression.
Cancer people make good skilled workers as well as eminent academics. They are good teachers and writers as well.

A landmark event would mark their career at the age of 35. They would fall victim to intrigues and machinations by rivals and enemies at the ages of 20, 32, and 40.
Those born in the Cancer Solar sign are advised to marry subjects of the same sign and those of Scorpioor Pisces.

JVP condemns moves to increase MPs' salaries
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) yesterday criticized the governments move to increase salaries of MPs and ministers while increasing tax on vehicles below 1000 cc mainly used by the ordinary people.
JVP MP Sunil Hadunnetti told the Daily Mirror that it was surprising how the government raised money to do so when it claimed the country was in a debt trap and the economy was in crisis.
The government is claiming that the economy is in crisis and selling state property including ports and airports to attract investors. We wonder how the government would raise funds to increase salaries if the economy is in crisis, he said.
He said people should also take the responsibility for electing politicians who continuously burden them. (Ajith Siriwadana)

Medical specialists to abstain from private practice: AMS
	
Medical specialists had decided to abstain from private practice from today against unfair taxation on medical professionals, the Association of Medical Specialists (AMS) said.
AMS President Dr. Sunil Wijayasinghe told Daily Mirror that the AMS along with other medical specialist groups had decided to refrain from private practice and added this decision was reached after months of failed negotiations with relevant parties.
Contrary to Finance Ministers repeated claims about the need for more taxes from everybody, the treasury has moved to announce changes in the new Tax Act to give major tax relief to Ministers and higher officials of the government, Dr. Wijayasinghe said.
However, he said recent Tax Act had doubled the tax on doctors by increasing the tax from 12% to 24%, whereas the Finance Ministry had reduced their own taxes and added the government had not announced any effective immediate method of widening the tax net causing them unfairness.
The AMS have requested all its members to attend in the normal duty in the hospital today and refrain from private practice. All relevant specialists will attend emergencies in private hospitals considering patient safety, Dr. Wijayasinghe added.
He reiterated that this was a protest by medical specialists of this country, who had exhausted all other means available to them to solve this problem. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Milestone celebration for Sir James Peiris Convalescent Home
	
Ninety years ago, on July 25, 1928, the Sir James Peiris Convalescent Home was declared open at No.17, Siripala Road, Mount Lavinia. This home was built on a property bought by Sir James Peiris on recognition of the need for such a facility during the course of his work at the Ceylon Social Service League (CSSL), a privately-funded association.
According to Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam, the initiator of this league was Sir James Peiris. In 1917, during his term as CSSL Chairman, a child welfare clinic, a milk depot, a needlework class for girls, a night school for adult education, a workmans resort and a crche for children and the poor were initiated. These facilities were established by the league as the then government had not attended to the disadvantaged sectors of the society.
Today, the Sir James and Lady Peiris Cheshire Home stands on this property where the Convalescent Home once stood. This is home to sixteen differently-abled male and female adults. They are provided with all needs free of charge. Finances, meals and other donations are received from local companies and private well-wishers to fund day-to-day needs of the home. The Sir James Peiris Trust makes a contribution towards the maintenance of the building. The home is run by a 20-member board of management headed by Mala Salgado, a great granddaughter of Sir James Peiris. It is also on record that the grandson of Sir James Peiris, Captain Dennis Cooray, was the Chairmen of the home for over 40 years.
Sir James Peiris was also known for his efforts towards political reform. His Memorandum on reform for Ceylon which he submitted at the bequest of Colonel Seely, Secretary for the State for Colonies (1909), was a milestone document. Two of the important changes suggested were the abolition of the then system of racial representation and introduction of the elective principle in place of nomination. This memorandum is regarded as being a visionary document which paved the way for the independence movement.
In 1924, the Legislative Council was reconstituted with a majority of elected representatives. Sir James Peiris was elected Vice President, the President being the Governor. This meant Sir James occupied the highest position available to a Ceylonese, and it was the highest position which any Ceylonese had ascended to during that time.
He lived according to his motto, which was truth conquers, and according to Louis Cooray, his eldest daughter: He proved that a man need not stoop to unworthy tactics to gain his ends. 
To celebrate the important event of the establishment of the home 90 years ago, and of the continuance of Sir James Peiriss legacy, religious ceremonies were held on July 25. Family members and a few others also donated wheelchairs and funds required to refurbish the storeroom, a long-felt need.

MR warns foreign countries not to accept assets offered by Govt.
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday warned foreign countries not to accept any asset offered by the Sri Lankan government saying he would pay attention to these agreements when they come to power.
Addressing the Jana Bala Sena protest rally organised by the Joint Opposition at the Vihara Maha Devi Park in Colombo, Mr. Rajapaksa said the government was leasing out national assets such as the Hambantota Port and the Mattala Airport in an authoritarian manner.
There is a group of people behind this sale of assets. We request the international players not to purchase anything offered by this government. We will pay attention to them when we come to power. The government was not given a mandate to sell any asset, he said.
He criticized the governments move to increase Customs duty on small cars and said the government was not even paying any attention to the needs of the people who voted for it.
The cost of living is skyrocketing. On top of that, the customs duty on vehicles were increased. There was a popular advertisement of this government before the election, which showed a girl assuring that the youth could buy vehicles if this government comes to power. These pledges have become jokes now, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Nightmare of a US-Iran war, oil prices may soar to US$ 250 a barrel
	
hen the United States president Donald Trump on Monday said in yet another quirky tweet that he was ready to meet the Iranian leader, the announcement generated hardly any vibe to arouse the excitement of the international community.
Iran is not averse to Trumps suggestion for a summit meeting, but it is firm in its insistence that the US should return to the nuclear deal and lift sanctions.
Trump during a White House media briefing on Monday said he would meet Iranian President Hassan Rouhani without preconditions. They want to meet, Ill meet. Anytime they want, he said, adding, Its good for the country, good for them, good for us, and good for the world. No preconditions. If they want to meet, Ill meet.
Compare this statement with the one that led to the historic meeting between the US President and the North Korean leader in June this year. A lot of homework had been done, the consequences meticulously assessed and secret contacts established with Pyongyang before Trumps meeting with Kim Jong-un was made public. And there was much for both sides to gain from the meeting promoted as a win-win summit by Trump supporters. Of course, Trumps bold move pushed his popularity ratings up by several notches. For North Korean leader Kim, the summit offered a platform to showcase his impoverished but nuclear-armed nation as a world power on par with the US, though the reality is far from that.
But with regard to Iran, instead of enthusiasm on the part of the US, what is evident is callousness or political dishonesty. For, Trumps offer amounted to a call for surrender to Iran and it smacked of the United States utter contempt for the Persian Gulf nation. Please note that the offer came just days after the maverick US President held out a threat of an all-out war against Iran, following Iranian President Rouhanis warning of a mother of all wars.
Trumps tweet in all caps read: To Iranian President Rouhani: Never, Ever Threaten The United States Again Or You Will Suffer Consequences The Likes Of Which Few Throughout History Have Ever Suffered Before. We Are No Longer A Country That Will Stand For Your Demented Words Of Violence & Death. Be Cautious!
True, he issued similar threats against North Korea even weeks before the June summit in Singapore. Trump ridiculed Kim as Little Rocket Man and threatened him with the same fate Libyas Muammar Gaddafi faced if the North Korean leader did not dismantle the nuclear programme.
Unlike North Korea, Iran is not a nuclear power. Iran cannot afford the luxury of upping the ante without the risk of precipitating a war with the US. Unlike North Korea whose nuclear weapons forced the US to set aside its superpower pride and meet Kim, Iran has no such trump cards. But it is not without its options, which, it has said, it will not hesitate to unleash if pushed to a corner.
The present crisis is not Irans making. It was triggered by Trumps announcement in May of the US withdrawal from the 2015 seven-nation nuclear deal. The agreement, signed by the US, China, Russia, France, Britain, Germany and Iran, during US Presidents Barack Obamas second term in office, sought to curtail Teherans ability to develop weapons grade nuclear material. The US pullout from the deal despite pleas from its European allies, paved the way for the re-imposition of tough US sanctions which target Irans trade in gold, its energy, shipping and insurance sectors and the transactions of its central bank. The purpose was to deny Iran the much needed oil revenue to build up the economy after years of crippling United Nations and US sanctions.
Trump, who cherishes undoing what President Obama has done, wants the agreement renegotiated to curb Irans missiles programmes and involvement in regional conflicts. In other words, he wants to see a militarily weakened Iran.
It appears that he is making the demand on behalf of Israel and Saudi Arabia. The two US allies have been uncomfortable with Irans increasing influence in the region, especially in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen.
The new US sanctions which will come into effect in November have already put Iran in an economic depression, as a result of which signs of growing unrest are already visible. Therefore, the government is desperate to take all measures necessary to overcome the crisis.
The other signatories to the Iran deal have said they would honour the agreement, but analysts believe that it is only a matter of time before the European nations and their big companies will crumble under pressure and stop trading with Iran, as they do not want to lose the much bigger US market.
It was against this backdrop that President Rouhani warned that if the US took measures to destroy Irans economy and thereby effect a regime change, it risked unleashing the mother of all wars.
In yet another warning, Irans leaders have said that if the country was denied its right to sell oil and improve its economy, then it may even impose a blockade of the Straits of Hormuz, through which a third of the worlds sea-borne oil passes every day. If this happens, analysts say world oil prices could shoot up to US$ 250 a barrel -- a nightmarish situation which could ruin world economies and bring about untold hardships to the people in poor countries.
Of course, the US Defence Department has said its navy is capable of ensuring the freedom of navigation in the strait. But when Iran imposed a similar blockade during the nine-year Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, the US could only take limited military action against Iran. During the blockade, Iranian attacks on tankers carrying Iraqi oil catapulted the oil prices to a new peak since the 1973 Arab oil boycott against the US.
Washington and Teheran, throughout post-World War history, have been friends at times, foes at times, and foes and friends at the same time. In 1953, the US engineered a coup in Iran to overthrow the democratically elected government of Mohammad Mosaddeq and instal the puppet Shah. A quarter century later, the 1979 Islamic revolution ousted the pro-American Shah and set up the Islamic Republic. Since then relations have plummeted to the lowest level following a series of development such as the Iranian students siege on the US embassy in Teheran, the Lebanese civil war and the United States outright support for Iraq during the nine-year Iran-Iraq war, during which Washington failed to condemn Iraqs use of chemical weapons. But the highpoint was when a hostile US during the Ronald Reagan Presidency in the late 1980s arranged Iran to buy weapons from Israel and the profits were diverted to the Contra rebels fighting Nicaraguas socialist government. The secret programme was called the Iran-Contra affair.
Given Trumps unpredictability, it wont be a surprise if he pulls out a surprise by meeting Iran halfway despite his commitments to Israel and Saudi Arabia, so that he could boast of producing an Iran deal much better than what Obama had signed. Will Iran agree However, the international community should redouble its efforts to bring about a win-win solution and avert the possibility of a US-Iran military confrontation which could only spell further doom for the world economy in general and poor nations in particular.

Pope Francis changes church stance on death penalty
	

Vatican, (Daily Mail), , 2 August 2018 - Pope Francis has declared the death penalty inadmissible as he changed the Catholic Churchs stance on capital punishment. 
The Church teaches, in the light of the Gospel, that the death penalty is inadmissible because it is an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person, the Holy See said in a statement. 
The change to the catechism, a question and answer guide to what Catholics should think about a wide range of moral and social issues, also says that the Church will work with determination for the abolition of the death penalty worldwide. 
Previously, the catechism said the church didnt exclude recourse to capital punishment if this is the only possible way of effectively defending human lives against the unjust aggressor. 
The new teaching, says the previous policy is outdated, that there are other ways to protect the common good, and that the church should instead commit itself to working to end capital punishment. 
The death penalty has been abolished in most of Europe and South America, but it is still in use in the United States and in several countries in Asia, Africa and the Mideast.

Mr. Channa Palansuriya, Chairman, Sampath Bank PLC and Mr. Nanda Fernando, Managing Director, Sampath Bank PLC
Sampath Banks Group pretax profit for the first half of the year exceeded Rs 10.3 Bn (28.2% growth) while Sampath Bank recorded a pre-tax profit of Rs 9.9 Bn for the same period. This registered a YoY growth of 28.1% in comparison to the first half of 2017. Profit after tax of the Bank too grew by 19.9% and reached Rs 6.8 Bn for the first half of 2018. Sampath Group, also posted a post-tax profit growth of 20.2%.
Fund Based Income (FBI)
Net Interest Income (NII), which is the main source of income representing almost 71% of the total operating income of the Bank, recorded an increase of Rs 4.5 Bn (34.3%) during the period under review. Accordingly, the Bank recordedRs 17.6Bn as NII for the first half of 2018, as against Rs 13.1Bn recorded for the corresponding period in 2017.
The above achievement was facilitated by healthy growth recorded in the Banks fund base.The advance portfolio of the Bank grew by 10.0% (annualized 20.0%) and the deposit portfolio grew by 7.4% (annualized 14.8%) during the first half of 2018.Further the Bank raised funds via a right issue (Rs 12.5 Bn) and a debenture issue (Rs 7.5 Bn) in thefirst half of 2018.Timely re-pricing of asset and liability products and other fund management strategies adopted by the Bank too played a pivotal role in achieving the 34.3% growth in NII.
Non Fund Based Income (NFBI)
Net fee and commission income, which largely comprises of credit, trade, card and electronic channel related fees increased to Rs 4.7 Bn during the period under review, as opposed to Rs 3.8Bn recorded during the corresponding period in 2017. This income source too has posted animpressiveYoY growth of 24.3% largely due tothe healthy growth recorded in the advances portfolio andexpansion of credit card operations.
The Bank's other operating income, net trading income and net gains from financial investmentstoo recorded anincrease of 18%during the period under review.Increase in realized exchange income has contributed to the saidincrease in other operating income. Consequently, other operating incomefor the first half of 2018stood at Rs 2.3 Bn, as opposed to Rs 1.8Bn reportedduring thecorresponding period in 2017.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses of the Bank which stood at Rs 7.9 Bn during the first half of 2017, increased to Rs 9.5 Bn during the period under review, reflecting aYoY increase of 20.4%. This increase was mainly due to the increase in personnel expenses triggered by annual salary increments.Other overhead expensestoo increased due to general price hikes. However, the Cost to Income ratio excluding VAT & NBT on financial services improved from 41.6% reported in thefirst 6 months of 2017 to 38.4% in the first half of 2018. This recordsan improvement of320 basis points,which is a significant achievementparticularly in view ofSampath Bank having one of the youngest branch network compared to its closest competitors.
Impairment Chargeson Loans and Receivables
Impairment charges amounting to Rs 2.8 Bn recorded for the first half of 2018witnessed an increase of Rs 1.4 Bn over the comparative periods charge of Rs 1.4 Bn. The number of customers qualified for individual impairment increased resulting in an increase in individual impairment of Rs 1 Bn.Meanwhile, the collective impairment charge also increased by Rs 0.5Bn predominantly due to movement of certain customers to higher arrears segments. Following the current industry trend, Banks NPA too increased during the first half of 2018 by 1.32% from 1.64% in December 2017 and stood at 2.96% by 30th June 2018. However, the Banks NPA ratio continues to be below the industry average.
Business Growth
Sampath Banks total asset base grew by 8.9% (annualized 17.8%) during the period under review to reach Rs 865.6 Bn as at 30th June 2018. In comparison, the total asset position as at 31st December 2017stood at Rs 795.1 Bn. Gross loans & receivables grew by 10.0% (annualized 20.0%) to reachRs 629.1 Bn as at 30thJune 2018, recording a growth of Rs 57.6 Bnfor the period under review. Total deposit base too increased by Rs 46.6 Bnfor the same period,to reach Rs 677.0 Bn as at the reporting date, a growth of 7.4% (annualized 14.8%).However, the CASA ratio which stood at 33.4% as at 30thJune 2018 showed a slight decline compared to the 34.9% registered at 31stDecember 2017. The decline can be attributed to the higher growth recorded in the fixed deposit base.
Performance Ratios
ROE (after tax) declined from 23.35% as at 31stDecember 2017 to 19.68% as at the end of the period under review due to increase in average equity base as a result of the Rights Issues in April 2018 (Rs 12.5 Bn) and November 2017 (Rs 7.6 Bn). ROA (before tax) has improved to 2.41% from 2.29% in the same period. Statutory Liquid Asset Ratio (SLAR) as at 30th June 2018was at 21.64%. The Bank maintained its SLAR well above the mandatory requirement of 20% throughout the period.
Capital Adequacy
CBSL introduced Basel III to the Sri Lankan Banking industry with effect from 1st July 2017. The full implementation would take place in three phases over a period of 18 months and is targeted to be completed by 1st January 2019, at which point Sampath Bank would need to maintain its Tier I Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) at 10% and Total CAR at 14%. In order to fall in line with these new regulatory requirements, Sampath Bank raised Rs 12.5 Bn worth of Tier I Capital by way of a Rights Issue in April 2018 and Rs 7.5 Bn worth of Tier II Capital by way of a Basel III Compliant Debenture Issue in March 2018. Sampath Bank maintained its Common Equity Tier I Capital, Tier I Capital and Total Capital Adequacy ratios as at 30th June 2018 at 12.25%, 12.25% and 16.70% levels respectively. All three ratios stood well above the minimum regulatory requirement of 7.375%, 8.875% and 12.875% respectively, applicable as at the reporting date.

Search for Sahan brings whispers of death
	

When Sahan Kumara Dharmasiri from Samanalawatte, Balangoda went missing on July 20, many would have thought it was another of those incidents where a child has been up to some mischief. But when he went missing for the eighth day, search operations began and the Sri Lanka Army and Police combed the forests and tea estates surrounding his residence. With no clues found, the Army concluded their search. Although speculation was rife that the child was bitten by a leopard in the area there was no evidence to prove such a happening. Several other incidents were reported, but none of them had direct
connections withthis incident. 

When theDaily Mirror visited Samanalawatte, situated 11 km away from the Balangoda town, several residents from the area assisted us to locate Sahans house. It was an uphill drive through tea estates passing scenic views with a thick mist in the backdrop. With a climate similar to that of Horton Plains, the Samanalawatte area, although is under-developed, is home to estate workers and rubber tappers.
 
The incident
Sahan Kumara Dharmasiri, a grade five student at Samanalawatte School, was to sit for the 2018 Grade Five Scholarship Examination when he went missing on July 20. Sahan is the eldest in the family and lives with his mother, father and four-year-old sister. According to media reports, the boy had gone missing after he had returned home from school. It is said that the boy went in search of his father who had gone to fetch firewood. The boys whereabouts arent known yet. Statements from relatives and his friends leave no clues. When we inquired further about Sahans disappearance, there was speculation whether Sahan was sold to a family living outside the city in an attempt to meet the financial needs of the family or worse, whether he was given away as a
human sacrifice!
 
Human sacrifices
With mining being one of the main industries in the area, possibilities of human sacrifices are high. According to myth and folklore, a human sacrifice is made in the name of Bahirawaya - a mythical deity. The human is literally thrown into the mine and the mine is then closed for a certain period of time. There is a belief that when the mine is reopened after this period, miners could expect valuable gems. For this purpose, in a majority of instances, it is the first born child in a family that meets the criteria as an ideal human sacrifice. However, whether this was the exact plight of Sahan is yet to be revealed. 


He goes to play after he returns home from school
- Deepika
According to his mother, Deepika Seneviratne, Sahan is a naughty child. Hes very stubborn and doesnt listen to us. When he returns home he usually goes to play. He was to sit for the Scholarship Exam, but he wasnt very keen on his studies. On the day Sahan went missing, his friends were also at school. We urge the authorities to help us find him, she said. 
In search of more clues, theDaily Mirror team inquired about his whereabouts from those in the neighbourhood, but we only met dead ends. 

Hes a tad bit mischievous
- Dharmasiri
I was not home when the incident took place, said H. Y Dharmasiri, Sahans father, whom we met while he was travelling. He had returned home before he went missing. Hes a tad bit mischievous, but this is the first time it has happened. There werent any regular places he went to, but he used to play with children in the neighbouring houses. It is rather sad that we lost our son. Im on the way for a pooja to seek help from God. I cant understand what happened to him. He doesnt study well, but understands what is being taught, he said. 
We then went further via the winding, rocky road until we reached his home. Sahans home is located at one corner of an enclosed neighbourhood with houses in close proximity. According to our observation its rather difficult for one to escape without anybodys notice. Sahans home has one bedroom and a space for the kitchen. He belongs to a family that is drowned in poverty and possesses only the basic amenities needed to live. 

Sahan was a slow-learner
- School Principal
Samanalawatte School Principal Deshapriya Suduwella, who was also Sahans class teacher, said that Sahan was identified as a slow-learner. He could remember what was taught and initially he had an issue with writing letters. But eventually he improved. He needed some guidance to improve the speed at which he was learning. Sahan mingled well with the rest of the children and was also involved in extra-curricular activities as well. On the day of the incident he came to school as usual and it was only later that we received the news. He usually comes to school with his friends and his parents dont come to drop or pick him up from school,said the school principal. 


"On the day of the incident he came to school as usual and it was only later that we received the news."

Suduwella further said the school and everybody else focus on improving the learning capacities of children like Sahan. Since this is a rural school we want to strengthen the relationships within the school community. We also have an annual plan and complete all events which are lined up. During the past years 78% of our students passed their O/Ls and we possess a high rank within the zone. Parents dont get very much involved with the childrens school work because they are either less-educated or illiterate and focus more on earning an income. We try to promote togetherness among children, who come from all walks of life. This is the first such incident that has happened and our only hope is to find this child and see that he returns home soon, he said. 


We have introduced hotlines
-Balangoda Police OIC
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Balangoda Police Officer-in-Charge said that so far there are no clues that would help locate the child. It has been 12 days since he went missing and were trying our best. The Army also called off their operations because there were no traces. Of course there were rumours about a person who came to the hospital with bite marks. There is also speculation about a leopard, but all that is deemed to be false.the OIC said.

Sessions should stop  Mueller investigation
	

By Carol D. Leonnig, John Wagner, Devlin Barrett (c) 2018, The Washington Post  Aug 02, 2018 - 
President Donald Trump on Wednesday urged Attorney General Jeff Sessions to terminate the investigation into Russian campaign interference right now, forcing his lawyers to scramble to clarify that the president was not ordering Sessions to take a specific action.

Democratic lawmakers and even some members of Trumps own party reacted with alarm to a series of inflammatory morning tweets in which the president called the prosecution of his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort a hoax and escalated his attacks on the investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. 
Trumps tweets came at a particularly sensitive time in the investigation, as a federal jury in Virginia is hearing evidence in Manaforts trial on tax evasion and fraud charges. 
This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further, the president tweeted. Bob Mueller is totally conflicted, and his 17 Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA! 
In an interview Wednesday, Trumps lawyers said the president was not ordering Sessions to take any specific action with his latest missive.

Some heretical thoughts on  Marxism
	

arl Marx and Friedrich Engels simplified history into a series of class struggles rooted in the conflict between the many and the few. From the few, the dominant philosophies of the West, including humanism and liberalism, had been summoned. What commentators batting for both these philosophies forget is that these ideologies were the products of mass exploitation on the one hand and privileges for the minority on the other. The many had no philosophy or system of thought which they could claim as theirs. The closest that Europe got to in those days to such a system of thought was the utopian socialism of Henri de Saint-Simon, Charles Fourier, and Robert Owen and the Protestant Reformation and the rise of the rebel, peasant sects (as with Thomas Mntzer and the Anabaptists). It was with Marx and then Engels that capitalism bred its own antithesis, as rational, as scientific, and as Judeo-Christian. 

"Engels argues in his introduction to the English edition of Socialism: Utopian and Scientific that British society, initially materialist, moved away from materialism as the industrial bourgeoisie rose to power"

Engels argues in his introduction to the English edition of Socialism: Utopian and Scientific that British society, initially materialist, moved away from materialism as the industrial bourgeoisie rose to power.
Science and industry had conspired to make them rich, but the materialism which had uplifted them horrified them when it became obvious that it could be used to rationalise the movement against them. No, this article is not about Marxism, materialism, or capitalism. It is about how these perspectives help explain the multidimensionality of class struggles in societies such as ours. 
What explains the deterioration of the class struggle in Sri Lanka The rise of neo-liberalism The stunting of the Left movement The self-contradictoriness of thatsame Left movement, not to mention the culture of self-aggrandizement privileged by the movers and leaders thereof My contention is that it is a combination of these factors, plus the fact that we have seemingly misconceived the lower depths of our society in both classist and ethnic terms. Marx argued that it is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but their social existence that determines their consciousness, he may have inadvertently passed over the other non-social factors that make us the flawed human beings we are. He conveniently left out the personal, which I think is as important as, if not more important than, the social in explaining the stratifications which continue to assail our society, not just in Sri Lanka. The personal explains why the Left movement failed and why it flounders even now. History is not a series of class struggles only; it is a history of movements that rise to address those struggles, only to fall back in the face of compromise and expedience. 
			
			In my opinion, the Left is still a force to reckon with, but in the hands of various forces that can hardly be considered sympathetic towards it, it has been distorted to such an extent that I can no longer view the world as one giant stage on which the workers of the world unite against their masters
			
		Contrary to what Engels imagined, the revolution did not transpire in Industrial Britain, and that because of a host of factors he did not take into account (most prominently, the parliamentary system, which despite its failures distinguished British society from the more autocratic monarchies of continental Europe). Revolution had to take place in a society far removed from Marxist ideals, in Russia, where capitalism had not fully been rooted and where the urban proletariat had to be rescued from the clutches of the idiocy of the rural peasantry. It was not Marxism that heralded the beginning of Communism, it was Leninism, and even that splintered in later years to the excesses of Stalinism, which finally was rejected through glasnost and perestroika. Historians and scholars who romanticise the Revolution naturally forget it was achieved at an enormous cost. Marxists did not reject the tools of capitalism. They found in them the path towards their utopias. The cost of communism was, therefore, no different to the cost of capitalism, industrialisation, and imperialism. As Isaac Deutscher correctly surmised, Stalin found Russia working wooden ploughs and left her equipped with atomic piles. The shift from the one to the other entailed great human suffering. 
Necessary Perhaps. It would have been impossible to be a moderate in those hard, divisive times, as the Mensheviks and the Social Democrats found out soon enough. But revolutions, whether industrial or communist, have a habit of perpetuating certain myths, and these myths have their peddlers. History is but the version we read, and the version that is written is the ideology of the person authoring it. Marxism bred its prophets, and those prophets evolved to dogmatists who still dream about perfect societies. Sri Lanka is no stranger to these dogmatists. They exist and they write. 
In Sri Lanka, the classist aspect of Marxism (which was, I think, the only aspect that was truly Marxist) morphed into an ethnic reading of Marxist tenets. This was largely a result of Western revisionist scholarship segmenting classism into gender relations and ethnic polarities, and this process of segmentation conforms to the model proposed by the eminent Czech jurist Karl Vasak, in 1979, whereby the notion of human rights evolved through three generations, from the bourgeois notion of liberty, equality, and fraternity during the French Revolution, to the notion of economic and cultural freedoms informed by the Civil Rights Movement (in turn informed by the left movement in the United States), to the unilateralist notion of self-determination facilitated by the rise of human rights law (in particular, the 1972 Stockholm Declaration and the 1992 Rio Declaration). Classical Marxism, unlike classical liberalism, had no place in the new world order, and the eighties, which saw foreign-funded NGOs hijacking leftist parties the world over, mangled Marxism as we know it. Distortion was the name of the game. In the end, the class went out of the picture, and in came ideologies pertaining to ethnicity and self-determination and separatism. 
I prefer to view history, not as a series of class struggles, but as a series of processes which are formed to ameliorate the ills of the world. Philosophies can only take us that far, and being a product of industrialisation and Judeo-Christian values, it was doomed to be as materialistic, as reliant on the desire to satisfy human wants, as capitalism. It wasnt just Nalin de Silva who contended that Marxism was as Judeo-Christian as Christianity, which was supposedly opposed to it. It was also Regi Siriwardena, who can hardly be called an anti-Christian Sinhala Buddhist chauvinist (not that Nalin is a chauvinist as some scholars paint him), who diagnosed Marxism as follows: Poverty is certainly an unmixed evil, which crushes both body and spirit, and it should be eradicated, but the viable alternative to it isnt unlimited plenty. There lies the problem of Communism: it sought to create a perfect universe but succeeded in creating a replica of the society it sought to combat, creating its own class hierarchies between the multitude and the officials. Marxism promised to somehow bring down the corridors of power, and it was revolutionary, but human beings eventually came to prefer evolution to revolution, and capitalism, after it passed its exploitative peak (not that it isnt exploitative today), coincided with Western democracy to create societies that ran on such an evolutionary streak, preferring gradual reform to radical change. 
Today the overwhelming driving force in the world is not capitalism, not communism, but nationalism. Marx discounted it, and so did the industrialists of the 18th century, but even with free trade and even with the Soviet Union, the world could not contain it. People misquote Engelss contention about the idiocy of rural life, but then again, there was never really anything to misquote. The meaning was clear: the aim of perfect societies was to salvage itself from agricultural backwardness through technological progress. Such an attitude discounted nationalism, which was seen as the bedrock of agricultural societies, though as the Russian experience shows, even the peasants had ambivalent responses towards it. Nationalists thus could not be counted on to further the objectives of Marxist societies, and it was here that the prophets of communism failed: the 20th century brought together trade unionism, trade blocs, and free trade in a way that upended the anti-nationalist diatribes of Marxist tenets. The workers of the world may unite, but they continue to be swayed by other, older passions. You saw it in Trumps America and you saw it in Kim Jong-Ils North Korea. You even saw it in revolutionary Russia, which would in later years channel Great Russian Chauvinism. 

"What explains the deterioration of the class struggle in Sri Lanka The rise of neo-liberalism The stunting of the Left movement The self-contradictoriness of that same Left movement, not to mention the culture of self-aggrandizement privileged by the movers and leaders thereof My contention is that it is a combination of these factors"


I mentioned at the beginning that Marx passed over the personal, when he contended that the social predetermined the consciousness of human beings. In one sense, that is the flaw of Marxism from which all other flaws follow. In the final analysis, we can, therefore, say the following: that in projecting history as a series of struggles between the many and the few, the prophets of Marxism, Leninism, and all those other -isms failed to account for the dynamism and the imperfections of individuals. The few are as susceptible to compromise as the many. 
In my opinion, the Left is still a force to reckon with, but in the hands of various forces that can hardly be considered sympathetic towards it, it has been distorted to such an extent that I can no longer view the world as one giant stage on which the workers of the world unite against their masters. On the contrary, I see in the leaders of trade unions, at least a great many of them, the same seekers of vested interests that those masters are. I am being heretical here, yes, but recent events, particularly in Sri Lanka, do bear me out.

Trace City vested with UDA through lawful means: Champika
	
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said yesterday the landmass of the Colombo Trace City project was vested with the Urban Development Authority (UDA) through lawful means, and therefore no another institution could stake a claim for it.
He was responding to Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva who said the Trace City project initiated by former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa would be taken forward.
Minister Ranawaka told the Daily Mirror nobody wanted to stop it. He said there was a military intelligence base located at this site earlier.
In 2011, the Army vacated it. After that, the land belonged to the Railway Department. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa vested it with the UDA. The President can vest any state land in that manner. Therefore, railway workers cannot strike demanding the land now, he said.
He said the area where the Trace City project would be linked by the proposed Colombo multi modal transport hub monorail and light rail lines.
Also, he said there was a proposal to expand the Trace City, but he was opposed to it. He said a new knowledge city would be developed in the Homagama area and therefore expansion was not allowed. (Kelum Bandara)

Undergrads are flowers and must bloom! - EDITORIAL
	

e all know that those who enter university must gear up to receive an education with breaks in-between. These breaks are not the ones that undergrads enjoy as vacations, but the ones that are caused through disruptions. Undergrads themselves are the ones who cause these disruptions, but there are times when outsiders show sympathy for their cause. 
This is one such time. Among the several issues which are bugging the university system, the key among them, which is much spoken about these days, is the problem associated with students of South Asian Institute of Technology andMedicine (SAITM).
It seems there is a breakthrough in this issues with a Gazette notification being issued by the President instructing the Kotalawela Defence University to absorb these SAITM students to pursue a medical degree. This gazette notification was approved in parliament following amendments. 
But the lives of these SAITM students which received a little sunshine have been damped again with the authorities of the Kotalawela Defence University demanding as much as Rs six million as the course fee to pursue this degree in medicine. One of the most beautiful features about university education in Sri Lanka is that its free. But in the face of university entrance being restricted to the very best, the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) gave its blessings to SAITM to award degrees, a decision which was backed by the thought that if quality private education is available here at an affordable price students dont have to migrate abroad to pursue higher education. Parents of these SAITM students have already started complaining about the monies demanded by the Kotalawela Defence University with one parent being quoted in the Daily Mirror saying that Government has again misled us. 
Another set of parents who are up in arms are protesting against the closure of the Peradeniya University. These parents are worried about the studies of their offspring because the university authorities have closed down the institute for a period of two months. What has annoyed these parents, who have formed a collective by the name of Parents Union of Medical Students (PUMS), is that their children have been punished for an issue which took place at the Engineering Faculty. University Education is such that camaraderie often supersedes personal ambition and this becomes the air that undergrads breath till they graduate. PUMS has to understand that what they should worry about, if at all, is if their children lose focus of their studies during these breaks caused by disruptions.
University life has its interwoven cultures. Ragging is one and brings those who think high and mighty of themselves to one platform before life at the university begins. But a statement was made by the Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe that those who were ragged recently were subject to physical and sexual harassment. Ragging within the university is a jealously guarded secret with outsiders not given half a chance to witness what happens within the walls of these academic institutes. This writer remembers an incident where a photographer of a leading national newspaper escaping being caught and assaulted when he went to capture in reel undergrads being ragged. But those who engage in ragging must take note that its banned and amounts to a punishable offence. And when the minister warns that the ragging has overstepped the mark, its time to seriously take stock of the situation. 
The minister has also shown concerns regard the protests carried out by undergrads saying that there have been occasions when the intention of such gatherings hasnt been pure. Minister Rajapakshe has accused undergrads of receiving funds from political groups. The denim clad, pony-tailed and often unshaven undergrads have to keep one foot in a lecture room and one on the streets; the latter in the face of threats to their rights to education. These vociferous undergrads must be protected. And when they bloom they promise to give the fragrance of flowers!

Unfathomable behaviour of a politico!
	

A story about how the strange behaviour of an affluent top team member caused wonderment tinged with amusement to those present at a religious ceremony is reported from a distant area in the country.

The top team member who attended a religious ceremony at a Buddhist temple had taken the gathering by surprise when he launched a tirade against a prominent politico and his family.
The religious ceremony over, the incumbent bhikkhu of the temple and the Dayaka Sabha members invited the distinguished guest to tea. They were disappointed when he declined the invitation and their disappointment had given way to a big surprise when he had given the reason for turning down their invitation.
Please excuse me, ape hamuduruwane, said the guest. Our Lokka  wants my chopper for a visit he had planned in another 15 minutes. Time now is 5.00 pm. I have to release the chopper for him at 5.15 pm on dot!
The Lokka he referred to was none other than the prominent politico he had berated in public a short while ago!
The bhikkhu watching with puzzled perplexity the top team member hurrying towards the waiting chopper with his security men at his heels had exclaimed: This man is puduma yakek! He is giving the tea party specially arranged for him a miss just because he wants to oblige the guy he was blackguarding left and right a little while ago!

Unity Govt. will never betray SL nor war heroes: Prez
	
President Maithripala Sirisena said today the unity government had never undertaken to divide the country or subjugate it to any foreign or domestic forces and neither will their be any room to do so in the future.

The President said some of the politicians were standing at Liptons Circus and attempting to achieve their political objectives by shouting outdated slogans asking the government not to betray the country and protect war heroes.
He said this at a ceremony to vest several development projects at the Hela Bojun Hala in the Manampitiya town in the people .

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who is said to be of the opinion that excise duty hike for vehicles under 1000cc engine capacity should be confined to a specific period of time had informed the Ministry of Finance to let him know as to when it could bring down the excise duty.
Sources close to Prime Minister said he had made this inquiry following the observation that had been made by finance ministry officials that the excise duty hike is an unpopular move as the government is being criticized for the hike already.
Also, others have advised the government that drastic increase of small cars with low capacity engines has given rise to a crisis where the traffic congestion is concerned. Further, it was reported that the expediting light train project will reduce this problem. (Yohan Perera)

Waruna Weligamage: Only local digital sculptor to receive intl accolades
	

culpture is the art of making two or three dimensional representative or abstract forms, especially by carving stone or wood, or by casting metal or plaster. The designs may be embodied in freestanding objects, reliefs on surfaces or in environments. Although sculpture is a household name in Sri Lanka, the terms digital sculpture seem alien. It is a widespread form of art used to create movies and cartoons.
Against this backdrop, it is noteworthy that Sri Lankan digital sculptor, Waruna Sanjaya Weligamage (31) has contributed immensely to the industry. He is currently working as a freelance digital sculptor at Quantum Mechanix (QMx) in California, USA. He is also the Managing Director of Man Cave Toys (Pvt) Limited.
Career
Speaking to Daily Mirror, Mr. Weligamage said he had worked as a salesman for a leading corporation in Sri Lanka for over 10 years.
I started self-learning 3D software in 2014. I studied all stages of production (concept, modelling, rigging, animation and composing). After two years of extensive learning, I started my career as a freelance custom sculptor for international collectors communities doing likeness portrait sculpts and have designed over 50 major movie characters so far, he said. Mr. Weligamage has also been designing props and accessories to match each of those movie characters. 
Achievements
Within a short spell, Mr. Weligamage was able to master the art of digital sculpturing. With his experience and industrial expertise, he formed a local company, Man Cave Toys (Pvt) Limited in 2016, to create customized sculptures of action figures and props. He also maintains a high-resolution lab which provides 3D prints. He has designed main characters for famous international blockbuster movies. 
Mr. Weligamage is the first Sri Lankan to showcase a 3D artwork at San Diego Comic Con 2017 in USA, as Quantum Mechanix (QMx) released Pennywise, the dancing clown figure in American supernatural horror film It. The movie directed by Andy Muschietti is based on the 1986 novel of the same name by Stephen King. It is the highest-grossing horror film and fourth highest-grossing r-rated film of all times.
Success story
Mr. Weligamage says his main interest of work is designing realistic human models and that he is conversant with the digital sculpting tool ZBrush. 
Sculpting has always been my passion and as an artist I am committed to work for any number of hours until the client is satisfied with the outcome of the undertaken project, he said.

He can be followed on Instagram and Facebook (Art of Waruna Weligamage)

## Title: WHY AM I HAVING A leaking bladder

WHY AM I HAVING A leaking bladder
	
Talking about the bladder is considered a topic thats taboo. We often ignore our bladders as long as they dont give us trouble. And when women do experience bladder problems, they often feel too embarrassed to seek help.
What is urinary incontinence
Simply it is the loss of bladder control and unintentional passing of urine. It means you leak a small amount of urine or release a lot of urine all at once. Its a common problem thought to affect millions of people.
Who can get it
Urinary incontinence affects twice as many women as men. Certain things can increase the chances of urinary incontinence developing, including: Pregnancy and vaginal birth, obesity, a family history of incontinence and increasing of age.
Types of leaks
There are mainly two types.Stress incontinence  This is when urine leaks at the time when your bladder is under pressure; for example, when you cough or laugh. This is the most common type of incontinence. It is also the most common type of incontinence that affects younger women.
Urge incontinence- With urge incontinence, urine leakage usually happens after a strong, sudden urge to urinate and before you can get to a washroom.
Minor forms are:Overflow incontinence Which is due to chronic retention and spill outContinuous incontinence  As explained it self-leaks through out.

Reasons for incontinence
You must understand how the body is able to keep the continence;
urine stored in the bladder. The bladder muscles tighten when you need to urinate and urine is passed through the urethra. At the same time the gate keeping muscles (sphincter) around the urethra relax to let the urine out of your body.
Incontinence can happen when the bladder muscles suddenly tighten by laughing, sneezing or exercising and the sphincter muscles are not strong enough to pinch the urethra shut.
Or it can happen due to inherent problems with in the bladder muscles and nerves giving in uncoordinated tightening which results in a leak.
Seeing a doctor
See your doctor if you have any type of urinary leak. It is not an uncommon problem and you shouldnt feel embarrassed talking to them about your symptoms.
Doctors diagnosis
Your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and your medical history, including: Medicines you take, if you have ever been pregnant and what your labour and delivery experience was like.
The doctors may carry out a pelvic examination, suggest you keep a diary in which you note how much fluid you intake, type of fluid, how often you have to urinate and its volume and any accidents that you have had.
Method of diagnosis 
They will go through your history examination and your urinary diary.
Your doctor may ask you to do other tests such as the following:
Urine test-Urine will be checked for infection or other causes of incontinence.
	Ultrasound-Take pictures of the kidneys, bladder, and urethra. 
	Cystoscopy-Your doctor inserts a thin tube with a tiny camera into your urethra and bladder to look for damaged tissue.
	Urodynamic-This allows your doctor to measure the pressure in your bladder to see how much fluid your bladder can hold.

Treating urinary incontinence
Your doctor will ask you to do simple measures to see if they help to improve your symptoms.Lifestyle changes Losing weight and cutting down on caffeine and alcohol.Pelvic floor exercises  Exercising your pelvic floor muscles by squeezing them. These exercises are taught by a specialist. Bladder training  You learn ways to wait longer between needing to urinate and passing urine. You are guided by a specialist.

Can I do it myself
Yes by simply practising.Right exercises- Replace jogging and aerobics classes with Pilates. This gentle method of stretching and strengthening core muscles has become more popular as a treatment for stress incontinence. High-impact exercise puts pressure on your pelvic floor muscles and can increase leakage. Sit-ups can also cause your leak because they strain your pelvic floor muscles.Avoid smoking- This lessens cough and bladder irritation.Right lifting- Tighten your pelvic floor muscles before and during an act when you do lift something like picking up children or shopping bags.Losing weight- Your BMI is a good indicator to check where you should be.Avoid constipation- Eating more fiber can help. It may also help if you change the way you sit and use your muscles to empty your bowels.Less caffeine- Coffee, tea, green tea, energy drinks contain caffeine, so cut down on these and replace them with water and herbal or fruit teas.
Cut down on alcohol.Eat right food - Avoid spicy and acidic foods, such as curries and citrus fruits.

at DGH Nawalapitiy)

And then try the following: Medicine- Depends on what type of incontinence that you are having. It is mainly for the urge incontinence.Surgery- Various modalities of surgeries are available mainly recommend for stress type. Vaginal pessary- Is a small plastic or silicone device (shaped like a ring) that you put into your vagina.Bulking agents- Type of injection given to tissues around the bladder and urethra to cause them to thicken.
You may also be offered incontinence products, such as absorbent pads and handheld urinals.

Yahapalana Democracy Not even Procedural
	

The role of the EC in holding elections to LG bodies proved it beyond doubt
	
	Why the EC has to abide by the existing laws and hold elections and need not wait for new laws

or once Prof. G.L has said something worth discussing. He had told media last Monday, his party, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) would file a petition in the Supreme Court requesting a Writ against the Elections Commission (EC) over its failure to hold elections for the dissolved Provincial Councils.
The Sabaragamuwa, North Central and the Eastern Provincial Councils stand dissolved for 10 months now, since September 2017.
In two months from now, the North, Wayamba and the Central Provincial Councils would stand dissolved.
He has told media, legal action would be instituted when the Court vacation comes to an end in late August.
Reason for not instituting legal action immediately as he says is because; it is only a week more for Court vacations to begin.
For a politically valid intervention, to stay mute for a month is too cheap a ploy to buy. For a legal luminary in fulltime politics, a week would be more than enough, if the statement made is firm and genuine.
Almost two months ago President Sirisena addressing his faction of the SLFP on June 2 had said the PC elections would be held before the year-end.
The UNP decided at its Working Committee last week to request the EC to hold the PC elections without delay (!) either on the old or the new system of electing members.
By then, the Chairman of the Commission Mahinda Deshapriya had on April 25 (2018) told the media (CDN) the Commission would hold elections to PCs in December, once the legal and Constitutional hindrances are swiftly resolved.
Neither had they been resolved swiftly during the past three months. Nor has the Government chosen any of the four options Deshapriya told the CDN (Ceylon Daily News), Parliament could adopt, to have early PC elections.
Firstly, Parliament can approve the delimitation report as it is, with a two-thirds majority.
Secondly, MPs can opt to revise the report by a committee appointed by the Prime Minister. If not, they can change the 50-50 ratio and prepare an early and speedy delimitation report again.
Or they can go back to the previous Preferential Ratio (PR) vote system,
He told the CDN, that if Parliament could decide on any one of those options, the EC could hold elections in December before the GCE O/L examinations began.

"The EC is playing with a vacillating and hesitant Government through publicity stunts, proposing options to keep the PC elections postponed"

Now it is August and over three months after the options were spelt out by Chairman EC. No decision had been taken by the Government or by the two main allies in Government, the UNP and the SLFP of President Sirisena as to what option they would go with.
Instead, the UNP wants the EC to hold elections anyway it can and President tells his men they would be December.
In end June the same Minister, who kept tearing off calendar pages one after another for the LG elections, tells the new Delimitation Committee in the presence of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, it would be December (2018) when the Government could be ready with a Road Map for holding PC elections.
He wouldnt surely decide on a Road Map for December, on his own. He is definitely in consultation with the President and the PM, is playing it soft with President, while on a collision course on many issues.
As it goes, PC elections will not be held end 2018 with only a Road Map proposed. The hurdle President Sirisena fears to hold PC elections is no doubt the MR Factor.
As Finance Minister SamaraweerasGam Peraliya thats rolled out with gusto to be given a fillip with a populist budget for the year 2019 in November indicates, the UNP is readying itself for the 2020 January Presidential Election and not for PC elections in December.
For Mahinda Rajapaksa, who has in his hands the political network at the local level after LG polls, needs to have with him the next level of political networking at the provincial level to push for Parliamentary Elections in mid or late 2019.


	Elections Commission should be held responsible for denying the people their right to elections
	
	
	The EC that aids and abets the Yahapalana Government to further erode democracy
	
	
	This makes the ground easy for Rajapaksa to run a totalitarian rule if he returns
	

There certainly is a difference in calculations within the JO too. Loners like Weerawansa and Gammanpila would want the Presidential and Parliamentary Elections as constitutionally scheduled for 2020 January and anytime after 2020 February, respectively.
They need to be of importance in a Presidential poll to successfully contest Parliamentary Elections thereafter.
Yet, MRs strategy that is worked on by Basil Rajapaksa is often heard through JO stalwarts like Dinesh Gunawardane and Vasudeva Nanayakkara, who also talk of Parliamentary Elections.
This Government cannot rule a country and that needs to be changed before it is too late, goes their main argument.
The Colombo protest last Wednesday led by the JO targeting the Government as anti-people is perhaps a beginning.
At the rate, the Government is fumbling with every issue without clear decisions made and then the two partners in Government getting into contradicting positions on almost all issues and mega corruption no less than during the Rajapaksas, the frustration building up in urban and semi-urban societies is what MR seems to be banking on.
He perhaps believes there will be the last straw on the camels back when people would want a change of Government before a change of presidency.
Thats when the PCs also become important for MR.
It would be a proverbial walk behind the goat, for MR to wait for his SLPP President Prof Peiris to go to Courts to provide him with the PC elections without any further delay.


"Now it is August and no decision has been taken by the Government or by the two main allies in Government, the UNP and the SLFP of President Sirisena as to what option they would go with"

It was this same Professor who was reported in the media a month ago on July 2 saying his SLPP would sue the FCID, the CID, the Rupavahini Corporation and the Associated Newspapers (Ceylon) Limited for a series of alleged defamatory stories that claimed China Harbour Engineering Limited had in 2014 provided US$ 07 million for Mahinda Rajapaksas Presidential Election campaign.
At the same media briefing, he was also reported as having said the SLPP would take legal action against the New York Times, for publishing similar defamatory allegations. He doesnt seem to have done what he said he would, and taking time over Court vacations seems, he would go the same way with this proposed legal action against the EC as well.
In short, it would not be anything more than his statement to media.
Yet, the fact remains, for once, his argument is on solid grounds. Chapter I Article 03 of the Constitution is clear about the right of franchise being an inalienable right of peoples sovereignty.It says
In the Republic of Sri Lanka sovereignty is in the People and is inalienable. Sovereignty includes the powers of Government, Fundamental Rights and the franchise.
That, therefore, is a basic, Fundamental Right of the people, the EC is constitutionally bound to protect and give validity to.
Read along with article 104B (1) of the Constitution, Article 104B (2) says,
It shall be the duty of the Commission to secure the enforcement of all laws relating to the holding of any such election or the conduct of Referenda and it shall be the duty of all authorities of the State charged with the enforcement of such laws, to co-operate with the Commission to secure such enforcement.
But has the EC been living with the Constitutional mandate Sadly not as an Independent Commission constituted under Amendment 19.
The role of the EC in holding elections to LG bodies proved it beyond doubt. According to the Constitution, the EC should treat franchise as an inalienable. Sovereign Right of the people and thus should secure the enforcement of all laws relating to the holding of any such election
It means laws that are valid at the time an election should be duly held is what the EC has to abide by.
It more than implies the EC need not wait for new laws the Government is contemplating in bringing or are still in the making.
Thus, if Parliament has not made required law to hold elections on the mixed system of PR (Proportional Representation) and FFP (First-Past-the-Post) with whatever gender representation and with the new delimitation report approved in Parliament at the time the PCs were dissolved, it only means the existing law that allows elections on the PR system is the law the EC has to hold elections to those PCs.
Instead, the EC is playing with a vacillating and hesitant Government through publicity stunts, proposing options to keep the PC elections postponed, violating its own mandate in the process.
It is the EC that should now be held totally responsible for denying the people their right to elect representative bodies.
It is the EC that aids and abets the Yahapalana Government to further erode democracy when it is there to safeguard democracy.
And thanks to this EC and Yahapalanaya, we dont even have the procedural democracy there was under Rajapaksa. Perhaps they are making the ground easy for Rajapaksa to run a totalitarian rule if he returns.
