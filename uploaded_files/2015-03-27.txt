Balachandran Jeyakumari?s daughter released
	
The Kilinochchi Magistrate yesterday ordered the release Balachandran Jeyakumari?s daughter Vibushika who was in the custody of the Mahadewa Children?s Home in Kilinochchi.
Balachandran Jeyakumari was earlier arrested by the Terrorist Investigation Division (TID) on charges of having provided accommodation for former LTTE activist Gobi.
She was later released on bail but her daughter had been handed over to the Children?s Home by the National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) on a Court order.
The case which was filed against Balachandran Jeyakumari was also later withdrawn by the TID. (Subramanium Baskaran)

Doctors reattach school boy's severed forearm
	
		 		 
		 
			
Colombo National Hospital Doctors have successfully re-attached a 15-year-old boy?s right forearm after it was severed in an accident at Balummahara on Thursday, hospital sources said.
CNH Chief Nursing Instructor Pushpa Ramyani de Soysa told Daily Mirror the seven-hour long surgery was performed soon after the boy was brought to the hospital with the severed part of the forearm. ?
?The plastic surgery was successfully completed by our doctors and staff and now the teenager is in a stable condition at a post-surgery ward,? Ms. Soysa said.?
Oshada Madushanka from Walauwatte in Gampaha was rushed to hospital after his forearm was severed in an accident when a Kirindiwela bound bus had overtaken another bus he was travelling in.
Initially the injured boy had been transferred to the Gampaha General Hospital and later transferred to the Colombo National Hospital.
The driver and the conductor of the bus had fled the scene but the bus was taken into custody. However, they had later surrendered to the Gampha Police and produced in the Gampha Magistrate?s Court and remand till April 2.(Piyumi Fonseka)

Engineering students extinguish fire with sound
	
 Imagine if all you needed to put out fire was a subwoofer. It's an idea that has been toyed with, theoretically, over the years -- DARPA demonstrated an acoustic extinguisher in 2012, following prior experiments from other researchers. Now, for the first time, a handheld extinguisher exists that uses not foam, powder or water, but the waves produced by a low-frequency sound.
The prototype extinguisher was developed by computer engineering major Viet Tran and electrical engineering major Seth Robertson of George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. The pair hopes their design could revolutionise firefighting, particularly in the home.
The technology is based on the way sound waves displace oxygen as they move through physical space -- oxygen that fire feeds on. If you can suffocate a fire, you can extinguish it, so the pair set to work. They discovered that music is unsuitable -- the sound waves it produces are inconsistent.
A higher frequency sound caused the flames to vibrate, but that was all. The lower frequencies -- 30 to 60 hertz -- seemed to be the so-called "Goldilocks zone" at which the waves were able to effectively keep the oxygen from the flames long enough to suffocate them.

The next step was the development of a portable, handheld extinguisher. DARPA's device, for example, was a large machine that can't be easily moved around. The prototype they developed consists of the sound frequency generator, a small amplifier, and a collimator made out of a cardboard tube with a hole at the end, to focus the waves in a specific direction.
This device was able to extinguish small, controlled fires created with an alcohol accelerant, proving that the concept is viable. Of course, the next step is further development -- testing the technique on different types of fires; seeing if it can keep these fires from reigniting, since the sound waves do not have a cooling effect like water does; and examining the feasibility of developing a device that could deal with larger fires.
If they can pull it off, though, it could be great news not just for homes -- the usage for which the extinguisher was originally envisioned -- but for fire departments too. According to the Washington Post, a local fire department has already requested to test the extinguisher on a structure fire.(Source: www.cnet.com)

'Evidence of mental illness' in Germanwings Co-pilot's house
	
	The Germanwings co-pilot who crashed his plane into a mountain killing himself and 149 people on board was receiving psychiatric counselling right up until the time of the crash, it emerged today.
	Andreas Lubitz locked the pilot out the of the Airbus A320's cockpit before setting the plane's controls to descend into a rocky valley, French prosecutors revealed yesterday.
	As well as having been signed off from training with depression in 2008, it was reported this morning that Lubitz had continued to receive mental health support up until this week's crash.
	The 28-year-old was also in the middle of the 'relationship crisis' with his girlfriend in the weeks before the crash and may have been struggling to cope with a break-up, German newspaper Bild reported.
	It was claimed this morning that the couple may have previously been engaged to be married next year.
	New information about Lubitz's life emerged just hours after police investigating the disaster began a four-hour search of his flat, which he is said to have shared with a girlfriend. Officers found 'evidence of mental illness' but no suicide note, Der Spiegel reported.
	Yesterday, the boss of Germanwings admitted Lubitz had slipped through the ?safety net? and should never have been flying. It was also revealed that the fitness fanatic had suffered from depression and ?burnout? which had held up his career.
	He reportedly received a year and half of psychiatric treatment and was at one point recommended to be examined by a doctor before flying.
	But, incredibly, he passed his psychological assessments and was later considered fit to fly. (Daily Mail - London)

History of Sri Lanka?s National Anthem mired in controversy
	
By D.B.S. Jeyaraj
A very effective message regarding the contentious? issue of the National Anthem being sung in Tamil was sent out earlier this week? to the? nation in general and the Tamil people in particular in the form of exemplary concrete action by the? triumvirate? comprising President Maithripala Sirisena, Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe and former President Chandrika Kumaratunga.
A symbolically meaningful event unfolded last Monday, March 23? at Valalaai in the Jaffna Peninsula where? a number of dignitaries participated. Chief among them were President? Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister? Ranil Wickremesinghe and former Premier cum President Chandrika? Bandaranaike? Kumaratunga.Over 400 acres of land taken over by the Sri Lankan armed forces to maintain a high security zone was handed over to the long deprived rightful owners on the occasion.The participation? of the ruling triumvirate of Maithri-Ranil-Chandrika at the event conveyed the message that the new dispensation was committed to the gradual downsising of the military presence in the north and east and the re-settlement of internally displaced people in their? original habitat. The presence of the top trio at such a simple ceremony in the north? demonstrated the avowed sincerity and goodwill of the new govt in bringing about ethnic reconciliation and amity.The Valalaai event also served to? relay another simple yet powerful signal in the sphere of ethnic relations. The Sri Lankan National Anthem was sung in both Sinhala and Tamil at the event. It was a symbolic gesture!The? Tamil version of ?Sri Lanka Matha? echoing in Valalaai resonated politically throughout the Island. The past few years had seen the country experiencing an unnecessary? problem? in the singing of the National Anthem in the Tamil language due to an? ill-advised measure by the Rajapaksa regime. A Cabinet paper advocating the National Anthem (NA) be sung only in Sinhala was ?shelved? after a heated intra-govt. debate. Orders however? went out quietly to Govt. officials and officers of the armed forces that the National Anthem should not be sung in Tamil. There was no official decree but ? officially sanctioned unofficial instructions?resulted in the silencing of the Tamil National Anthem.
?
	Unofficial Diktat
The subterfuge adopted was that of maintaining status quo overtly while negating in? practice the singing of? the National Anthem. It was stated that there was no change and that the Constitutional provisions remained. Thus it was said that singing the National Anthem was a right that prevailed and had not been taken away.An unofficial diktat however was strictly enforced by which schools, govt institutions etc were ?discouraged? from singing the NA in Tamil. The armed forces in the North and East were tasked with the duty of preventing the National Anthem being sung in Tamil. ?
The Tamil people soon got the message and gave up attempts to sing the National Anthem in Tamil. School children were compelled to sing the Sinhala words scripted in Tamil. People like Wimal? Weerawansa went about saying Tamils wanted to sing in Sinhala and not in Tamil. Thus the right to sing the National Anthem in Tamil was suppressed forcibly on the one hand while being? falsely asserted? on the other,? that the right to sing the NA in Tamil remained still.
The issue hurt the sentiments of the Tamil speaking people? widely. Besides it seemed utterly absurd to prevent a Tamil version of the NA also being sung in areas where Tamils were concentrated or in functions connected to Tamil Medium schools.As? reported in these columns last week, Democratic Peoples Front (DPF) Leader Mano Ganesan raised the issue of the NA being sung in Tamil at the National Executive Council meeting. President Sirisena? to his credit? responded positively and reiterated the Constitutional position that there was no bar on the NA being sung in Tamil.He? guaranteed that the NA could be sung in Tamil also in the future. President Sirisena?s positive response evoked a predictable reaction from the pseudo-patriots.
There were howls of protest.A campaign of misinformation and disinformation about the National Anthem being sung in Tamil got underway.This column while stating the case for singing the National Anthem in Tamil was perturbed over the contrived ?backlash?. Though? appreciative of President Sirisena, I was concerned whether he would be forced to backtrack due to pressure. This was how I concluded last week?s article on the National Anthem issue-
?Now there is a ray of hope again after President Sirisena?s assurance to Mano Ganesan at the National Executive Council. There has always been a hiatus between pledges and performances in the ethnic relations sphere of Sri Lanka. Already the knives are out to scuttle the move and it remains to be seen whether President Sirisena can bring about a transformation where the National Anthem could be sung by the Tamil speaking people in their mother tongue.It is my hope and prayer that patriotic Tamils should be able to hail ?Mother Lanka? as ?Sri Lanka Thaaye? in their ?Thaai Mozhi? (Mother tongue)?.
?
	Valalaai? Event
It is against this backdrop that? this column derives great satisfaction from the Valalaai event.According to a young Tamil journalist, the National Anthem was first sung in Tamil and then in Sinhala. The? music was played on tape while a ?choir?from the staff of the Jaffna District Secretariat sang in both languages. The gathering including the distinguished leaders stood to rapt attention. It was truly a heartwarming spectacle and a harbinger of hope. It demonstrated clearly that the new dispensation of Maithri, Ranil and Chandrika will proceed slowly but steadily in seeking remedial action in issues such as the singing of the National Anthem in Tamil also.
To strike a personal note at this juncture -last week?s column by this writer was well received widely. It also resulted in huge amounts of feedback much of it positive. Nevertheless there were negative responses too. What these responses made me realise once again was the similiarity between Sinhala and Tamil hawks and how both groups adopt different paths to arrive at a common destination. Sinhala hardliners do not want the National Anthem to be sung in Tamil while Tamil hardliners do not want Tamils to sing the National Anthem of Sri Lanka.Thus both want the same result for different? reasons.
Much of the negative feedback was also the result of ignorance and prejudice. More heat than light was shed on the issue. I was truly shocked at the total ignorance of? many? people about the history and background of our National Anthem.There were some who admitted their lack of knowledge and wanted to know more about its origins and evolution. Since I have examined the contours of the crisis brought on by singing the National Anthem in Tamil in detail last week, I shall? draw on my earlier writings and focus more on Ananda Samarakoon?s? composition and its? controversial history this week .
A National Anthem is a song of patriotic sentiment affirming loyalty to one?s country or nation adopted officially by that Country or Nation. An anthem becomes a National Anthem through Constitutional provision, specific legislation or long ? standing tradition.Stylistically the majority of anthems are marches or hymns.They are usually written or composed in the most common language in the Country.There are however some notable exceptions to this rule particularly in multi-ethnic countries.
?
	Retrospective Gaze
As is well known the National Anthem of Sri Lanka was written by Ananda Samarakoon. It was however not intended to be the National Anthem when? it was written.Controversy however was nothing new as far as the National Anthem of Sri Lanka is concerned. A retrospective gaze into the evolution and growth of our National Anthem shows that the song has been mired in controversy right from the beginning. The concept of a National Anthem was introduced by the British to what was then Ceylon. The modern Ceylonese nation itself was a colonial construct.It was the British who integrated different territories under their control into a single entity and set up a unified administration for the Country.
?God save the King/Queen? had become the British National Anthem by 1745. This was through usage and custom and not by Parliamentary decree. With the British empire expanding gradually ?God save the King/Queen? was sung as the National Anthem in all countries and territories ruled by the British. Ceylon was no exception and under Queen Victoria?s rule ?God save the Queen? became in practice the National Anthem for Ceylon too. This continued throughout the twentieth century also.
The Ceylon National Congress (CNC) set up in 1919 on the lines of the Indian National Congress received new impetus in the second quarter of the 20th century when Dudley Shelton Senanayake and Junius Richard Jayewardene became its joint secretaries.The CNC resolved to adopt a national song for Ceylon.Accordingly a lyric was composed by DS Moonesinghe and set to music by the legendary Devar Suryasena, son of Sir James Pieris. This was sung in 1943 at the CNC sessions. But ?God save the King? continued to reign supreme under the rule of King George the sixth.
Thus when Ceylon gained dominion and later full independence status there was no approved indigenous National Anthem to be sung .The Lanka Gandharva Sabha was assigned the task of formulating a National Anthem. A competition was organized and a panel formed by the Sabha was entrusted the duty of selecting an appropriate anthem.This panel comprised SLB Kapukotuwa, Dr.OHD Wijesekera, Lionel Edirisinghe, Mudliyar EA Abeysekera, LLK Gunatunga and PB Illangasinghe.
?
	Controversial Decision
In a controversial decision, two of the panellists were declared winners.A song written by PB Illangasinghe and set to music by Lionel Edirisinghe was announced to be the new National Anthem.It began as ? ?Sri Lanka Matha/Pala Yasa Mahima/Jaya Jaya? and ended as ?Jaya Jaya Dada Nanga/Sri Lanka Matha?.The fact that a song submitted by two members of the selection panel had ?won? the national song competition evoked widespread resentment and protests.It was seen as blatantly unfair.Although the song by the Illangasinghe-Edirisinghe duo was broadcast over the then? ?Radio Ceylon? on the morning of Independence day as the national song it was not sung at the official Freedom Day ceremony due to protests. While the song itself was flawless and above reproach it was the perception of favouritism in the decision to adopt it that fuelled criticism and protests. Thus the song which won the national song competition was unacceptable as far as the people were concerned and began losing credibility.
Meanwhile another song was slowly beginning to capture popular imagination of the people as a potential National Anthem. This was the famous ?Namo Namo Matha? written by Ananda Samarakoon, who was a well-known painter as well as poet. Ananda Samarakoon was born on January 13, 1911 in a small village, Liyanwela, near Watareka in the Padukka area. His parents, Samuel Samarakoon and Dominga Pieris were Christians. The son was christened George Wilfred. His full name was Egodahage George Wilfred Alwis Samarakoon. There was no Ananda in his name then and he was known as George Wilfred during his childhood and early twenties.
Young George Wilfred studied at Christian College, Kotte (now Sri Jayewardenepura MMV). In 1934, he joined the staff of Christian College, as a teacher of art and music. Inspired by Rabindranath Tagore, George Wilfred joined Shantinekathan, Tagore?s School of Fine Arts in Bengal.He joined Shantinekathan in 1936 and studied art under the famous Bengali artist Nanda Lal Bose, and music and singing under Shanti Devi Gosh. He came back in 1937 without completing his course and started teaching again. Upon his return George Wilfred became known as Ananda Samarakoon. In 1940, he joined the staff of Mahinda College, Galle.
?
	?Shanthiniketan?
?Namo Namo Matha? was not written originally for the purpose of being a National Anthem. Its genesis is interesting. Samarakoon used to pay frequent trips to India even after his academic pursuit at ?Shanthiniketan? had ended.On one occasion he returned from India by air on his first ever plane trip. Samarakoon looking down? from the skies was enthralled and excited at the sight of his native land . He jotted down a few words and lines that came to mind immediately after landing.
On October 20th 1940 he was at his ancestral residence in Padukka. Unable to sleep he tossed and turned in his bed. Suddenly he got up at about 10 pm and began writing a tribute to his motherland relying on the short notes written after his air trip from India. Samarakoon wrote late into the night and the immortal ?Namo Namo Matha? was born. He then took it to Mahinda College where he was teaching and taught it to students after setting it to music.
The song became popular and was included in a musical record in 1946. Being a fine singer himself Samarakoon recorded the song with his partner Swarna de Silva the sister of famous flautist Dunstan de Silva. The song was also included in a book of poems published by him. It was called ?Geetha Kumudini?. Sadly Samarakoon was unable to re-imburse the printing costs incurred to the printer R.K.W Siriwardena and handed over copyright to him.Samarakoon was to regret this later when his creation came to be acknowledged as the National Anthem.When the Gandarva Sabha conducted the competition to select a national song Samarakoon was away from the Island in India, but his wife and brother had submitted ?Namo Namo Matha? for the competition. Though fully deserving it was overlooked and ?Sri Lanka Matha,Yasa Mahima? by the Illangasinghe-Edirisinghe duo was selected.
Despite ?winning? the competition ?Yasa Mahima? was spurned by most people because of the manner in which it was declared the winner. ?Namo Namo Matha? without any official status was enjoying wide exposure and popular acclaim. Its popularity among ordinary people was so great that public opinion favoured ?Namo Namo Matha? over ?Yasa Mahima?.
The song became famous after a 50 member choir from Musaeus College,Colombo sang it on a public occasion. It was also broadcast on Radio frequently. ?Namo Namo Matha? though without official? recognition was now becoming popular as the ?de-facto? National Anthem.
?
	?Namo Namo Matha?
In 1950 the then Finance Minister JR Jayewardene presented a cabinet memorandum that the widely popular ?Namo Namo Matha? be formally acknowledged as the official anthem. Prime Minister D.S Senanayake set up a Parliamentary Select Committee under Home Affairs and Rural Development Minister Sir E.A.P Wijeratne (Father of Dr.Nissanka Wijeratne) to finalise the issue. The committee headed by Wijeratne considered ?Namo Namo Matha? and some other lyrics and decided that Samarakoon?s song should be made the National Anthem. There was however a minor hitch. The committee wanted a minor change in the words. Samarakoon was then in India and returned home in mid -1951 after being summoned by Sir Edwin AP Wijeratne. The song had originally been composed when the country was under the British.Now it was independent.It was therefore felt that the 10th line in the song was inappropriate and had to be changed. Samarakoon agreed to change the line. So the line ?Nawa Jeewana Damine? was altered to ?Nawa Jeewana Demine Nithina Apa Pubudu Karan Matha? with the wholehearted consent and approval of Ananda Samarakoon. Sir E.A.P Wijeratne then presented a Cabinet paper in August 1951 recommending ?Namo Namo Matha? as the National Anthem.
It was unanimously approved by Cabinet and formally adopted on November 22, 1951.Premier D.S Senanayake proposed that a suitable Tamil translation? also be formally adopted.The select committee headed by Sir E.A.P Wijeratne had accepted in principle that there be a Tamil version of the National Anthem.
The Tamil scholar, Pundit M. Nallathamby, was entrusted this task and a neat transliteration was done.The Tamil version came into use and was extensively used in official functions in the predominantly Tamil speaking Northern and Eastern Provinces.? Four years after getting freedom on February 4, 1952, ?Namo Namo Matha? was sung at Independence Day ceremonies as the official National Anthem.The Tamil version ?Namo Namo Thaye? was sung in related Independence Day functions at the Jaffna,Vavuniya, Mannar, Trincomalee and Batticaloa Kachcheries. With an appropriate transliteration available, the Tamils of Sri Lanka found themselves singing the national anthem with emotion and fervour in their mother tongue.
When Sir John Kotelawela visited Jaffna in 1954 the Tamil version of the National Anthem was sung at functions felicitating the Prime Minister. On March 12, 1952 the Government published huge advertisements in the Sinhala,Tamil and English newspapers announcing that ?Namo Namo Matha? was the National Anthem. While words in Sinhala and Tamil were published in the Sinhala and Tamil newspapers respectively the English newspapers had Sinhala words written in English.
?
	Official Anthem
While Namo Namo Matha was now being sung as the official anthem there was no uniformity in the melody or manner of singing. Different choirs and singers were rendering it in different ways.This was causing much confusion.So the Government decided to appoint a committee to ensure that uniformity was ensured in rendering the National Anthem.An eleven member committee was appointed in 1953. Among its members were Ananda Samarakoon himself, Devar Suryasena and JDA Perera.
This committee set out guidelines as to how the anthem should be sung and also defined the exact tune for it.The melody was a refined version of the original tune composed by Samarakoon. On June 24, 1954 the Cabinet of Sir John Kotelawela formally endorsed the tune and singing of the National Anthem. The reputed firm Cargills, then agents for HMV Records, was given the order to make records of the National Anthem. A disc was also cut for the Tamil version of the National Anthem. While the melody and music was the same as that of the Sinhala version by Ananda Samarakoon the Tamil words written by Pundit Nallathamby were sung by two women singers Sangari and Meena. The Tamil version was first broadcast officially on ?Radio Ceylon? on February 4, 1955.
While the Sinhala version was sung in most official functions in Colombo and Sinhala majority provinces the Tamil version was sung in Tamil majority areas and Tamil medium schools. This accommodative attitude was displayed even? after Sinhala was? made the sole official language and Tamil had no official status at all.
Tamil received national language but not official language status in the 1978 Constitution. The National Anthem in Sinhala was given Constitutional status through clause seven of the same Constitution. However the Tamil translation was also given Constitutional recognition by way of the third schedule to the seventh clause.The official gazette as well as Copies of the 1978 Constitution published in Tamil had the Tamil words of the National Anthem.
Tamil received elevation as an official language along with Sinhala by way of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution in 1987. Tamil as an official language received further enhancement in the administrative and legislative spheres through the 16th Amendment to the Constitution in 1988.Thus the elevation of Tamil as an official language provided? greater impetus for the National Anthem to be sung in Tamil as well.
?
	Ananda? Samarakoon
An extremely troubling aspect in the? controversial history of the National Anthem was the tragic plight of its creator Ananda Samarakoon.The poet was star crossed in many ways.The copyright ownership of ?Namo Namo Matha? was formally acquired by the Government after the payment of Rupees 2500 on June 24, 1954.The money however did not go to Ananda Samarakoon as he had already transferred copyright to Siriwardena the printing press owner who had first published the song in a book of poems.
Having one?s composition officially recognized as the National Anthem was indeed a great achievement. Ananda Samarakoon having accomplished this feat was entitled to bask in glory after reaching that milepost. Alas!That was not to be so.Instead of a dream existence there commenced an ordeal that turned out to be a cruel nightmare for the poet.
In 1956 S.W.R.D Bandaranaike became Prime Minister riding the crest of a Sinhala nationalist wave. The new Government hailed as ?Apey Aanduwe? ran into a series of problems and difficulties soon. There were political demonstrations against the government, strikes by workers, communal violence and natural disasters like floods, fires and landslides.
In the search for scapegoats certain elements (with vested interests perhaps) pounced upon the National Anthem.In a burst of superstitious or irrational frenzy ?Namo Namo Matha? was singled out as the cause for all the troubles afflicting the country under the Bandaranaike dispensation. A vicious campaign was launched against ?Namo Namo Matha?.
?The charge was that the notations in ?Namo Namo Matha? were unlucky and the cause for the country?s ills and misfortunes. The letter ?Na? at the beginning was described as a malefix.The inauspicious ?Ganaka? or ?Gana? at the beginning of the National Anthem had an ill-effect on the country it was alleged. A ?gana? is the placing of the first three syllables ? how the long and short syllables occur. The opening words of the anthem ?na-mo-na? short-long-short constituted an unlucky gana it was stated.
?
	?Amaraneeya Lanka?
As criticism mounted Ananda Samarakoon was constrained to defend himself against the charges. He engaged in many newspaper debates and also spoke at public meetings in defence of ?Namo Namo Matha?. To make matters worse Samarakoon underwent financial difficulties. Although he conducted a regular programme on the Educational service run by ?Radio Ceylon? his creative compositions did not meet with much commercial success.He produced a song and dance pageant ?Amaraneeya Lanka? in 1957 but it was a major flop. The onslaught against ?Namo Namo Matha? destroyed Samarakoon?s peace of mind.
In September 1959, Prime Minister S.W.R.D Bandaranaike was assassinated. Elections to Parliament in March 1960 saw a hung Parliament emerge. Dudley Senanayake?s short lived minority government fell. Fresh elections were called. The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) was swept to power in July 1960. Bandaranaike?s widow Sirima became Prime Minister.The new Government took the campaign against ?Namo Namo Matha? seriously.
The Home and Cultural Affairs Minister Maithripala Senanayake appointed a committee of ?experts? to examine the issue and determine whether the National Anthem was the cause of the country?s troubles.The committee recommended that the words ?Namo Namo Matha? be changed to ?Sri Lanka Matha?. Ananda Samarakoon protested vehemently and opposed the proposed change. The Government however went ahead and unilaterally amended the National Anthem from ?Namo Namo Matha? to ?Sri Lanka Matha? in February 1961. Ananda Samarakoon?s consent was not obtained.Since copyright was now vested with the Government there was no legal remedy available to the poet to prevent this arbitrary action.
?
	Debilitating Effect
The act however had a distressing and debilitating effect on the poet.The well ?known journalist Kumudini Hettiarachchi wrote a poignant article about Ananda Samarakoon in the ?Sunday Times? some years ago.In that article she quotes the poet?s nephew Sunil Samarakoon about how the matter affected his uncle.
One day when Sunil was eleven years old his uncle had parked his baby Austin car near the gates and shouted out to Sunil ?Puthe ,Mage oluwa galawala, wena ekak hikarala? (son my head has been removed and another fixed instead)?When Loku Thaththa told me that his head had been removed and another placed there, I was just a child and didn?t catch the significance, until much later. He was, of course, referring to the substitution of Namo, Namo Matha, with Sri Lanka Matha in the National Anthem,? said Sunil Samarakoon, nephew of Ananda Samarakoon, the composer of Sri Lanka?s National Anthem.
?I remember the day he came home to talk to my father, as he usually did when he had a problem. When I went to greet him as soon as he parked his car, he put his hand on my shoulder and said those words about the oluva (head) in despair. He was never the same again. He became morose. They had changed it without even consulting him.? Wrote Kumudini quoting Sunil.
On April 5th 1962 Ananda Samarakoon was found dead.. His door was broken open as he was not answering knocks on his door. The inquest revealed that he had died of an overdose of sleeping tablets. There was a letter on his desk to then opposition leader Dudley Senanayake complaining of how his anthem had been mutilated. There was also a serene painting on his easel of Lord Buddha meditating and a deer looking on.
A few days before his death, Samarakoon wrote a letter to the ?Timesman? column on the ?Times of Ceylon? newspaper .He wrote, ?The anthem has been beheaded. It has not only destroyed the song, but also destroyed the life of the composer. I am frustrated and broken-hearted. It is a misfortune to live in a country where such things happen to a humble composer. Death would be preferable?.This then is the tragic tale of the poet who composed the National Anthem of Sri Lanka.

	75th Anniversary

The occasion could be utilised to cement ethnic reconciliation further by emphasising the common heritage of? our National Anthem.It would be far more useful to celebrate the? 75th anniversary? of? our National Anthem? rather than? to squabble over the language in which it has to be sung.D.B.S.Jeyaraj can be reached at dbsjeyaraj@yahoo.com

SL contradicts Chinese claims on Port City
	
Deputy External Affairs Minister Ajith P. Perera today dismissed the statement made by his Chinese counterpart yesterday that the Chinese-funded Port city project will resume. ?
Speaking to media at a press conference a short while ago, Minister Perera rejected the Chinese media reports which quoted the nation?s Assistant Minister of Chinese Foreign Affairs Liu Jianchao stating that the Port City project is back on track.
He said it was not even a subject of discussion - either during the meeting between the two Presidents or during President Sirisena's discussions with top officials of the Chinese government.
"No decision has been made on whether the project will be completely halted or continued or concerning the issues that have been highlighted regarding the project. The only mention by President Sirisena with concern to the project was that it?s a temporary issue and that Sri Lanka continues to welcome Chinese investors, which in no way implies that the Sri Lankan government or the President has given the green light for the project to continue," he added.?

Sri Lanka to go tough on player fitness
	
Blames lack of fitness and poor form for the early exit from the World Cup
Sri Lanka cricket coach Marvan Atapattu admitted that last year's hastily arranged five-match ODI series may have contributed towards a lack of fitness among team members and insisted that more emphasis must be placed on the fitness of the cricketers.
?We must have a minimum fitness criteria for national team selection,? Atapattu said, at a press conference held yesterday at Sri Lanka Cricket. ?Going into the future, I think we must stress on this in order to minimize injuries during tours?.
Sri Lanka were forced to make several changes to their original 15-man squad for the Cricket World Cup due to injuries, a key reason for the exit of the defending runners-up at this year's quarter final.? Dinesh Chandimal, Dimuth Karunaratne, Dhammika Prasad, Jeevan Mendis and Rangana Herath had thus to be replaced during the tournament.
In 2014, the national team abandoned midway their physical training program aimed at the CWC after Sri Lankan cricket authorities agreed to a five-match ODI series against India to replace West Indies who pulled out due to a contract dispute. The move was criticized by many, including batting great Kumar Sangakkara. Sri Lanka lost the series 5-0.
?I wouldn't say it was the main reason but it was not the best thing that happened going into a World Cup,? Atapattu said referring to the five-match series in India. ?But it was a collective decision, the board, the selectors and the team management took."
The Chairman of Selectors Sanath Jayasuriya endorsed Atapattu's view. He said? selectors will place serious emphasis on player fitness in future.
?
?We will have take some serious decisions with regard to player fitness. Like Marvan said, we must have a minimum fitness criteria for selection not only to the national team but also to Sri Lanka A and other teams,? he elaborated.
?We have had number of injuries during the last two months and this certainly played a bigger role in our exit. On the other had, we were one of the best fielding sides in world cricket for years and I think it?s high time we get that reputation back,? Jayasuriya stressed.
Meanwhile, Atapattu--who has suffered misfortune as the first local coach the country has had since 1999--also said that Sri Lanka should give more opportunities to youngsters to settle down in their positions.
?If you look at Chandimal, he has scored ten more runs than legendary Kumar Sangakkara has scored after 15 matches. But where is Kumar now? He is the world?s best batsman today.? I believe it?s important that we have patience with these youngsters and give them opportunities to settle down in their positions in the team,? said Atapattu.
Skipper Angelo Mathews said he was disappointed with the top order batting that led to the defeat against South Africa.
?We did well in the first six matches, but then our top order batting failed against South Africa. This is where we lost the match,? he added.
