Ashraff's son slams Dawood over 'Muslim State remarks
	
Responding to a statement made by SLMC Chairman Basheer Segu Dawood with regard to a separate Muslim State, the partys late founder M.H.M Ashraffs son Aman today said that his fathers mandate was solely for a united Sri Lanka, undivided by any means.
During a discussion held in Kathankudy on Saturday, Mr. Dawood had said that the SLMCs stance was that the Muslims need a separate Province and the SLMC late founder too had endorsed it.
Writing a direct letter to the now SLMC Chairman, Aman requested him not to distort historical facts for his personal merit.
During the early course of his political voyage, Mr. Ashraff said if and only if, the Tamils of Sri Lanka are granted a separate state unto themselves, then it is only fair that the Muslims of Sri Lanka also be granted one as well. However, his political views had changed over time, Aman said.
He said having being appointed as Minister for Ports, Shipping, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction, Mr. Ashraff addressed a gathering of the SLMC High Command and Politburo members at the Taj Samudra Hotel stating thus:
"As a party representing a minority in this country, we have reached the limits of our abilities. If we are to serve the nation and its people at a greater degree, we must then, now look to expand our horizons into national politics and aim to define a role for ourselves within.
Thus, he began to devote his career and time exclusively towards the formation of the National Unity Alliance (NUA) a pluralistic political entity whose mandate was solely for a UNITED Sri Lanka, undivided by any means.
You know this well, because you were one of the few who did not agree with this new and rapidly evolving political vision of Mr. Ashraff, which is why he did not appoint you to the High Command of the NUA.
He was well aware that you lacked the political maturity then (and still do now) to realise that a divided nation will forever be a defeated nation, Aman said.

Demand for separate Muslim Province is vital: Dawood
	
Muslims cannot give up their demand for a separate Muslim Province, SLMC Chairman Basheer Segu Dawood said at a discussion held in Kathankudy on Saturday in the context of submitting their proposals to the new constitution to be enacted.
He said that it was not prudent to step down from the demand of a separate province for Muslims.
"The Tamils had demanded self-determination. They have neither stepped down nor had given up their demand. They have also not stepped down from their demand for a merged North-East. This could be described as a stratagem or a political manoeuvre deployed by them. Similarly, a Muslim Province only will give a motherland and self-determination to Muslims and we cannot give up our demand. If we were to do so we could dissolve all the Muslim parties and join a majority parties like the UNP or SLFP," he said.
He said that a separate Muslim identity did not mean winning a few Parliamentary seats and Cabinet portfolios.
Sri Lanka Muslim Congress was established in order to uphold the fundamental rights of the Muslim polity. If the majority community could have many parties and the Tamil polity a few parties why couldnt the Muslims form a party to represent their community, he queried.
"We cannot under any circumstances give up our demand for a Muslim Province. If we give up our demand we must also exit from the party or discuss with the Muslims and give up the party and also our demand," Dawood said.
"The SLMC stance is that the Muslims need a separate Muslim Province. Our late founder of SLMC M.H.M Ashraff too endorsed it. If a Chief Ministers conference is held a Muslim Chief Minister should definitely participate in it," he said. (M.S.M Noordeen)

Provincial officials to boycott workshop by LG Ministry
	
At a meeting of Chief Ministers and Provincial Education Ministers it was decided that provincial officials could not be used like puppets by the government and as such a decision was taken not to allow them to participate in discussions and workshops arranged by the government without obtaining the consent of the Provincial Council concerned.

SL to purchase oil from Iran
	
The Government was planning to revitalise its oil purchases directly from Iran in the context of the United States lifting its economic sanctions on that country, a Minister told the Daily Mirror yesterday.
The Government of Sri Lanka had to suspend its fuel imports from Iran after the US imposed economic sanctions a few years ago. However, the sanctions have now been lifted following the change of Government in Iran.
Asked how the government would pursue oil related transactions with Iran, Petroleum and Petroleum Gas Minister Chandima Weerakkody told the Daily Mirror that he would visit Iran next month to do the needful in this regard.
I will negotiate with Iranian authorities how we can proceed in this respect, Weerakkody said prior to his departure for an official visit to the US.
Once I conclude my visit to the US, I will head for Iran to resume talks on doing transactions with that country again, he said.
The Government stopped oil related transaction with Iran way back in 2012 due to sanctions.
The Government found it difficult to open Letters of Credit for imports as transactions in US dollars were rendered virtually impractical, as a result of transactions.
The then Government opted for Saudi Arabian fuel. Sanctions against Iran also affected Sri Lankas tea exports.
Iran used to purchase tea worth as much as US $ 400 million from Sri Lanka annually.(Kelum Bandara)

Unpaid bills halt SchoolNet
	
The SchoolNet Online Educational System, which provides free Internet access to 2,800 government schools, has come to standstill because of the non-payment of bills by the Education Ministry.
The Ceylon Teachers Union (CTU) General Secretary Joseph Stalin said it was a month since the online system, which facilitates studies by accessing reference materials, tutorials, emails and other educational programmes, had been stopped its services.
He said Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam had promised the CTU that arrangements would be made to settle the outstanding payments so that Internet facilities to the 2,800 schools could be resumed.
The monthly bill of each of the 2,800 schools was some Rs.7, 000 to 9,000 paid by the ministry.
The minister told us that the facilities will be resumed in two to three weeks after discussions between the Minister Kariyawasam and Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando on a new data package worth Rs.1,500 providing more internet data access, Mr. Stalin said.
Sri Lanka Telecom is the infrastructure and service provider for SchoolNet. Each school is connected to SchoolNet VPN at different access speeds based on the current requirements. (Piyumi Fonseka)
