Australias interest is a secure, stable  and prosperous Sri Lanka  - Senator Concetta Fierravanti-W
	
Australian Minister for International Development and the Pacific, Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, who was in Sri Lanka on an official visit last week, says Sri Lanka has a lot of potential as a country. In an interview with Daily Mirror, she said she was impressed by the visit.
"The trade relationship between Australia and Sri Lanka has the potential to expand, and to expand into other areas. I had the benefit of having a very productive economic roundtable with some business organizations doing business here."

At the end of your visit, what is your impression about the government and the country
It is truly a beautiful country. This is my first visit and it has afforded me opportunities not only to see the beauty of this country but also to see some of the work Australia has been doing for a very long time. Our relationship with Sri Lanka goes back to 70 years. During my time here, I was really pleased to open a wonderful exhibition which looks at a pictorial history of the 70 years of development assistance. Over this time, we have provided $1.35 billion in development assistance and we are one of the top bilateral donors to Sri Lanka. We have been consistent and constructive, and we have done a lot of things over those years. Our relationship goes right across so many sectors. We have helped in de-mining, education, water systems, training, economic development and public infrastructure.
What is the kind of importance you attach to relationship with Sri Lanka
What we actually planned was to put our relationship much more on an economic development footing. If I can give you a couple of examples, we went to the Northern Province. I visited a number of different places. One of course was a crab factory. This is a very good example of how Australia has partnered with a private company, the International Labour Organization (ILO) and local fishermen to establish a crab factory. We are talking about a sustainable crab industry for fishermen in that area.
They bring in crabs. Then there is a factory. We have 80 women working there earning good wages. That crabs, within a short period of time packaged and exported to the American market. It is a very practical example where Australia is partnering with the private sector on long term sustainability for a local community. Another example is some of the work we do in our Skills for Growth Programme, where we are specifically targeting the tourism industry. We had a fruitful discussion about this with Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe. We looked at how we were cooperating particularly in the skills and vocational training sector. We have also been working very closely with the Education Ministry to support the education system through the Transforming School Education Programme with the World Bank. I visited a school where I was able to see this in practical action.


"We have also been working very closely with the Education Ministry to support the education system through the Transforming School Education Programme with the World Bank. I visited a school where I was able to see this in practical action"


One very important thing that I launched today was a new $ 15 million programme over four years called Women in Work. We are partnering with the International Finance Corporation - part of the World Bank - to cooperate with Sri Lankan business circle to create better opportunities for women. That is basically to provide toolkit for businesses to say it makes good business sense for you to include women in your business supply chains. There is value being added to your businesses. We are hopeful that this will provide valuable tools for business activities to look at employing more women. There is an issue of unemployment and underemployment of women in the economy. These are four very different aspects of our relationship.
How do you look at the economic potential of Sri Lanka in the post war context
Well, of course, Sri Lanka is strategically positioned. There is no doubt about it. As maritime trading nations, we work closely with Sri Lanka. The trade relationship between Australia and Sri Lanka has the potential to expand, and to expand into other areas. I had the benefit of having a very productive economic roundtable with some business organizations doing business here. 
The strong sense that I got was that Sri Lanka is now at an important crossroads in terms of economic development in terms of potential. Tourism of course is very important. Clearly the government is embarking on a programme of reforms.  That programme of reform includes facilitation of business, making it easier for people do business in Sri Lanka. I think that is really important. From a country like Australia, we can lend technical assistance, expertise and support in different ways. We look forward to see the programme of the government being rolled out, particularly the economic reform process. This is something we have gone through in Australia in the past. We had to take difficult decisions which were at times challenging. But, those are necessary to go to the next step - to make it easier for businessmen to invest and for foreign investors to come to the country. All of these are challenges. But, they are also the opportunities for the Sri Lankan government. Wherever we can, we lend support to the SL government in terms of technical expertise. We think Sri Lanka certainly has a potential value as it attempts to implement an economic reform agenda.
With your outlook, how possible is it for you to encourage Australian investors to come toSri Lanka
Well, I have to say that there has been quite a bit of to-ing and fro-ing from our two countries. We had a number of business delegations. I actually met Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva in Australia last week. We are starting to see those linkages being made. Ultimately, the strength in any relation between Australia and any other country has been the people-to-people links.
 Sri Lanka and Australia have not only this long history, but on the statistical front. For example, through the Australian Government we have funded scholarships for more than 1,000 Sri Lankans since the early 1950s, quite apart from all the students who have gone through private means. We have about 7,500 students going to Australia to study at present. We have students in Sri Lanka studying at universities here that are collaborating with Australian universities. Those linkages are very important. 
We also have quite a large Sri Lankan community living in Australia. Its about 140,000 though thats probably quite a conservative figure. Those linkages are very important, and ultimately are the ones that will form the entrepreneurial base between Australia and Sri Lanka. Therefore, one of the things I have looked at during this visit, is the ways that Sri Lankans living in Australia can utilize their skills better, can look at ways they can invest in Sri Lanka and how to encourage them to invest back home to the ultimate benefit of the people of Sri Lanka. 


"It is important that the international community work constructively with the Sri Lankan government to get implementation of those transitional and justice arrangements and commitments right. We are supportive; we recognize the work the government has done to date"


In any post conflict situation, there are always concerns and we respect those. But in the end, this is a very good window of opportunity for good local economic growth. Now that takes partnership with government reform, it takes partnerships with encouraging people to want to invest in Sri Lanka. One of the things we look at is tourism, which could be a very good opportunity.
This is one of the sectors that we are going to help the Government with up skilling in the tourism sector. We know that is going to be vitally important for the country. We can make practical contributions in that area.
What is the latest approach to address the issue of illegal migrants from Sri Lanka to Australia
We have excellent bilateral cooperation in border protection and maritime security. We have a very close partnership with the Sri Lankan government in countering people smuggling.
We appreciate the strong collaboration that we have with the Sri Lankan government on the return of illegal human-smuggling ventures. We have to deter the crime of human smuggling because otherwise people would get lost or die in the sea. Therefore our joint efforts to date have saved in our view many lives and many people from perishing at sea.
These economic migrants seek safe haven in Australia citing Sri Lanka as an unsafe place to live. You saw for yourself the situation here. What is your message to them
There are very positive stories about Sri Lanka from people who have been involved in the conflict area and people who have come back to Sri Lanka, and people who have chosen to stay back. As your Prime Minister said in Australia, we want people to return home.
He has encouraged people to return to Sri Lanka. We want to make it very clear that we want to deter human smugglers from getting people on boats. We have complied with our international legal obligations, especially in the return of Sri Lankans. It is important that we work with the Government of Sri Lanka to put human smugglers out of business. As I said, we have successfully deterred some ventures, which have avoided lives being lost at sea.
What is your observation on the governments reconciliation process
We welcome very much the efforts by your government to progress the implementation of its Geneva commitments on human rights, reconciliation and accountability, of course, including the establishment of the Office of Missing Persons. Also we welcome the work done in progressing the Office of Reparations.
We have been pleased to co-sponsor the two-year extension given to Sri Lanka in Geneva.
It is important that the international community work constructively with the Sri Lankan government to get implementation of those transitional and justice arrangements and commitments right. We are supportive; we recognize the work the government has done to date. We are very supportive of the process of reconciliation. In practical ways, we have made a substantial contribution in the humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to Sri Lanka. We have invested close to Rs. 30 billion in the North and East since 2009; especially in de-mining, road construction, housing, education and business development.
One of our programmes, the North-East Local Services Improvement Project (NELSIP), we tied up with the World Bank. We invested $25 million in NELSIP between 2011 and 2017, and yesterday I had the opportunity to travel on some of the roads we actually helped build. That was the sort of practical way we have assisted in the reconciliation process. We have also assisted in other practical ways. Apart from helping to spread the economic peace dividend, we supported post conflict institutions and strengthening the Office of National Unity and Reconciliation.
We have facilitated constructive engagement with the diaspora. We have also supported the government, where it requests it, on transitional justice mechanisms.
What is your opinion on the Constitution making process
We are very supportive of the process. Obviously, we will consider future requests that we may receive in relation to possible assistance. We continue to provide reconciliation support in those practical ways.  For us, the long term stability, prosperity and peace in Sri Lanka as an Indian ocean neighbour is very important. That is Australias interest in a secure, stable and prosperous Sri Lanka. We remain very committed to supporting the Sri Lankan government in its efforts to ensure that it continues on a path towards being a prosperous and reconciled country.


"We have complied with our international legal obligations, especially in the return of Sri Lankans. It is important that we work with the Government of Sri Lanka to put human smugglers out of business. As I said, we have successfully deterred some ventures, which have avoided lives being lost at sea"



The GoSL has taken steps to ensure and improve the rights of women. What is your observation on that
That is very important. Today, we launched the Women in Work programme. This is a very good project. We are very pleased that the Minister for Women and Child Affairs attended to support the launch of this project. We are investing US $ 15 million in the project, in partnership with the International Finance Corporation at the World Bank.
It is a programme that encourages companies to look at ways women can be more involved in their supply chains, not just to employ more women but why it makes good economic sense for women to be involved. By providing companies with a toolkit to look at ways their companies can employ more women and why this makes good economic sense. It is vitally important to any economy to have its women, half its population, fully employed..
What is your message to theSri Lankans at the end ofyour visit
I am very pleased to have been here. We have stood by Sri Lanka in the past and we will continue to do so in the future. Australia has been a long standing friend. 70 years has gone past, and we look forward to our long-standing close friendship continuing for many, many years to come.

## Title: Betel Leaf - A symbol of fortune and prosperity

Betel Leaf - A symbol of fortune and prosperity
	
Just like milk rice, oil cake (kevum), kokis and plantains, betel leaves are considered an indispensable item during the Sinhala and Tamil New Year. Its purity and holiness are the same to the kings as well as the common man. All of them respect, offer, receive and chew it with condiments like Arica, Chunam and Tobacco. Unlike any other item, anyone could share betel without the slightest of shame. Betel is offered to deities, the clergy and even devils and sorceress, seeking their blessings. During the New Year season, we exchange betel leaves to mark social acquaintances. Betel leaves have been an essential item in every aspect of life from times immemorial.
Bulath Malla and Hambiliya
It was customary to carry a Hambiliya, a small bag filled with betel leaves and various condiments such as lime, catechu and tobacco, whenever our forefathers went on a journey. Some had bags made of cloth called Bulath Malla to carry betel. It was normal for them to offer betel to anyone they met on their way. Offering betel had been a means of expressing cordiality and friendship. This custom is being continued in villages even today.
In the past, when the village headman (Vidane) and village level officers (Mohottalas) went on duty, the servants had to carry a Bulath Malla.
Betel during New Year
The betel leaf plays a pivotal role during the Sinhala and Tamil New Year. Offering of betel starts from the smallest unit in the society, the family. Elders in the family receive a handful or bundles of betel, each containing forty leaves. This offering is to forget all ill will, hatred, differences and disagreements during the past year, and to invoke blessings for building cordiality, friendship, intimacy and oneness during the new year.
Betel on New Years Eve
In the eve of the new year, villagers offer betel to the priests, the native doctor, headmaster of the village school and elders. These blessings are indeed important and indispensable for good fortune and prosperity throughout the new year.
Gifts wrapped with betel leaves
When gifts (especially cash) are offered on special occasions such as in events of sacrifices or when introducing the alphabet to children, they are wrapped with betel leaves.
Good fortune and prosperity
The betel leaf is a symbol of good fortune. It is used in festive events including at times of performing religious rites, visiting and receiving relatives and friends, in anointment, cooking the first meal and in setting off for work in the New Year.
Matrimonial affairs
The betel leaf is an essential item in matrimonial affairs. The closest members are invited for wedding feasts by offering a handful of betel leaves. Inviting ones relatives without betel leaves is likely to be taken as an insult.
The betel leaf is given a prominent place in almost all activities of a marriage ceremony. When the bridegroom visits the bride, it is customary that he be received by offering a tray of betel. On the wedding day, the oldest member of the bridegrooms party is received by the brides party on behalf of her parents and family members by offering bundles of betel leaves. The most important item in the Poruwa ceremony is betel. Betel leaves make the marriage ceremony a joyous occasion.
Magul Poruwa
The bride and bridegroom are made to drop betel on the Magul Poruwa. This is done with the hope of making the marriage a prosperous one. Relatives of the couple exchange betel leaves from each others trays.
Auspicious events
In auspicious events too, betel leaf is given prominence. Trays of betel leaves are kept in funeral houses with betel leaves turned upside down. Visitors are received by offering bundles of betel leaves. The pavilion constructed for chanting Pirith is decorated with betel leaves hung from the canopy. When people are possessed in devil dancing ceremonies, it is necessary that a tray of flowers called Malyahanawa,consisting betel in addition to rice, coconut and red flowers, be there. 
Betel is the most important item in all ceremonies involving children. When rice is first fed to a child, betel leaves (served on a plantain leaf) are kept round the meal. Also, when a child is admitted to school, a handful of betel leaves is offered to the schools headmaster.
Betel leaf in invitations
In invitations, betel leaves are offered as a mark of respect. When betel leaves are turned upside down, it indicates that the invitation is for an inauspicious or unfortunate event. When someone pays a visit to a friend or a relative, the first invitation of a villager is for a chew of betel. Treating someone with betel is not a difficult task that involves fat money.
Sharing betel
It is not a shameful act to share betel with anyone, either it be the rich or the poor, the known or unknown. It is believed that a chew of betel prevents several diseases including heart ailments. However, excess consumption of it could cause cancer.History records that Prince Wasabhas aunt had saved a life of a patient by sending a bag of betel leaves without lime. Another interesting tale about Gampolaya and Raigamaya tells us how Pepper leaves had been used as an alternative to betel leaves.
Betel cultivation
Betel plants grow in any part of the country. Areas like Gampaha and Weyangoda are famous for betel cultivation.
Varieties of betel
There is a special variety of betel called Nagavalli which has white speckles on green leaves. This kind is used especially in exorcism. In addition to Nagavalli, there are other kinds of betel like Gasbulath, Garandi Bulath, Gata Thondu, Diya Bulath, Mahameru Bulath and Rata Dalu Bulath.
Bulath Atha, Bulath Hurulla and Bulath Vita
Bulath Atha or Bulath Hurulla is a handful of betel leaves (a bundle of forty leaves). Bulath Vita or quid is betel that consists of various condiments such as lime, catechu and tobacco. However, condiments like cloves, cardamom, nutmeg and Aralu can be added to make the quid of betel richer.
Betel during the Sinhala kings
During the reign of Sinhala kings, betel was given a prominent place. This is evident from the old betel dishes or shelves of areca-nut cutters and Chunam boxes seen in our museums. There is enough evidence to the effect that kings and noble men in ancient Sri Lanka had chewed betel. The messenger in the Royal palace had offered King Sri Wickema Rajasinghe a golden tray of betel consisting of at least twenty to thirty condiments.
Ill effects
According to evidence, betel had been brought to this world from the world of Nagas or the infernal region. It is believed that Naga King Anantha had brought the betel leaf in his mouth (it is believed that the stalk of the leaf had been poisoned as he held it with his mouth). It is therefore customary to tear off the stalk of the leaf before chewing. Afterwards, one must rinse his or her mouth well.
There is yet another story regarding the origin of betel. After drawing the picture of a hare in the moon, God Sakra had thrown the paint brush which got struck in Naga King Ananthas body and a betel leaf had emerged from the hood. Exorcism performers recite poems relating to the origin of betel.

SEOUL AFP April10, 2017 
Chinas top nuclear envoy arrived in Seoul Monday for talks on the North Korean threat, as a US naval strike group headed to the region in a show of force. 
President Donald Trump, fresh from a missile strike on Syria that was widely interpreted as putting Pyongyang on warning, has asked to be provided with a range of options for eliminating the Norths nuclear capabilities. 
Presidents before and President Trump agreed that that is unacceptable, that what must happen is the denuclearisation of the peninsula, US National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster told Fox News on Sunday. 
Speculation of an imminent nuclear test is brewing as the North marks major anniversaries this month including the 105th birthday of its founding leader -- usually celebrated with a demonstration of military might.

45 dead, 100 injured at Palm Sunday massacre
	

ISIS claimed responsibility for the bomb attacks on two Coptic churches in Egypt on Palm Sunday (09.04.2017) via its Aamaq news agency, after having recently warned it would step up violence against Egypts Christians. 
The first blast ripped through a Palm Sunday service at St. Georges Church in Tanta, killing at least 27 and wounding 78 others, while CCTV showed a fanatic, dressed in a blue pullover, approaching the gate at St Marks in Alexandria but being told to go through the metal detector first by officers. 
He then passes a female police officer talking to another woman, and enters a metal detector when an explosion engulfs the area. 
The attack is suspected to have been aimed at Pope Tawadros II, leader of the ancient Coptic church, who was worshipping in St Marks at the time but escaped unharmed.The bombings added to fears that Islamic extremists who have long been battling security forces in the Sinai Peninsula are shifting their focus to civilians. 
An ISIS affiliate claimed a December suicide bombing at a Cairo church that killed about 30 people, mostly women, as well as a string of killings in the northern Sinai that caused hundreds of Christians to flee. CNN reported Coptic Christians make up about 10% of Egypts population of 91 million. They base their theology on the teachings of the apostle Mark, who introduced Christianity to Egypt. 
Grand Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, head of Egypts Al-Azhar -the leading centre of learning in Sunni Islam- condemned the attacks.

He quickly covered up the slip
	

This politico from Wayamba once functioned as a deputy purohita.He has made it a practice to attend every funeral that takes place in his area irrespective of the political affiliations of the deceased or the bereaved family.

In fact, he has given instructions to his political faithfuls in different parts of the district to inform him whenever a death occurs in their respective area. As soon as hears about the death of a person he would rush to the funeral house and pretend grief as if he had lost a close friend. And very often the members of the bereaved family would invite him to deliver an oration at the funeral.
Quite recently this politico rushed to pay his last respects to a deceased in a remote corner of the district and the funeral proceedings were already on at the time he reached the place.
The kith and kin of the deceased who learnt about the arrival of the politico invited him to deliver an oration. The politico who happily accepted the invitation started addressing the gathering of the mourners. Passing away of my good friend is a great personal loss to me. In fact, we used to meet very often and in fact, I had occasion to have long chat when I met him last week too The politico with an eagle eye noticed that the people were looking at one another as if sharing a common message. Some were looking amused and there were also titters audible to him. Meanwhile, a friend standing by him whispered something into his ear.
Of course, unfortunately my good friend at that time was unable to speak, he continued. But he told me a lot by sign language

President Maithripala Sirisena said today the income from the taxes for liquor and cigarettes had been reduced for the first time of the history.
The treasury reported the Cabinet that the income from the taxes for liquor and cigarettes has been reduced for the first time of the history. Though this is a decrease of the income for the government, we consider it as a great investment for the future generation, he said.
President Sirisena said the Drug free Country program, inaugurated by the government to build a healthy nation by saving the future generation from the drug menace, had resulted in the decrease.
The President expressed these views at the ceremony to open the new building complex of the Teldeniya District Base Hospital, Kandy today.
He pointed out that the main benchmark of the development of a country is education and health. A country where educated and healthy people are living is rapidly moving towards development, he said.
He said it is the governments goal to lead all sections of the country towards an efficient development. Today Sri Lanka is getting international support like never before. The governments objective is to use that support for the development of the country, the President added.

Following yet another enthralling set of arguments in the semis, Colombo University and KDU made their way to the finals.
While both sides put up strong cases for their clients, General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University emerged winners, with the adjudication of Supreme Court Judge Justice Buwaneka Aluwihare PC along with Judges of the Court of Appeal Justices A.H.M.D. Nawaz and Lakshman Dehideniya. The awards for the Best Mooter and Best Runner-up Mooter were won by Nath Gunawardena of KDU and Vikum Jayasinghe from the Colombo University respectively. The duo received their awards from Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya PC.
The prestigious championship shield H.V. Perera Memorial Award was presented in memory of Queens Counsel Herbert Victor Perera, a prominent lawyer Sri Lanka has ever produced.
The Runners-Up trophy was sponsored by Sri Lanka Law College Principal
Mrs. Indira Samarasinghe PC in memory of her parents Mary Therese and Reginald James Senaratne.


The Moot Society was happy to have been joined by Dr. H.V. Pereras granddaughter in this endeavour.
The society hereby expresses its profound gratitude to the high-profile personalities -- officers of the Attorney Generals Department, attorneys of the unofficial bar and Judges of the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal -- for making themselves available at the event despite their busy schedules. Furthermore, the organisers are grateful for the patronage extended by legal professionals and corporations to make the competition a reality.

LIOC holding on to Trincomalee oil tanks illegally
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today accused the Lanka India Oil Company (LIOC) of illegally holding on to the oil tanks in Trincomalee.
Party leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake told a media briefing that this was clear when considering the Cabinet paper submitted by Petroleum Resources Minister Chandima Weerakody last year.
According to this document, the Sri Lankan Government and the LIOC should have signed a tax agreement within six months after handing over the tanks in Trincomalee. However, that has not happened. In such a scenario it is obvious that the LIOC is holding on to the tanks illegally, the MP said.
Between 2005 to 2009 the CPC has paid the LIOC Rs 692 million as taxes while the LIOC has paid only Rs.75 million. This is like renting a house for Rs.100,000 a month and obtaining a room from the tenants at a monthly rental of Rs.1 million, he said.
He said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had meanwhile submitted a Cabinet proposal to hand over the oil tanks in Trincomalle to a public-private company with India despite what's happening with the oil tanks. The MP said National Policies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama was due to finalise an agreement with India by the end of this month.
We will join the trade unions to defeat the moves being made by the government to handover the oil tanks in Trincomalle to this company, he said.
Citing reasons to oppose this move, the JVP leader said the government would be able to save Rs.618 million annually if it distributed oil to filling stations in Anurdhapura, Polonnaruwa and the North from Trincomalle instead of transporting oil form Colombo as done currently. (Yohan Perera)

New Year sales drop by 40%: AIEC
	
New Year sales have dropped by 40 per cent when compared with last year because of the reduced purchasing power of the people, says Hemaka Fernando, the spokesman for the Association of Importers of Essential Commodities (AIEC).
He said the drop could be seen in the sales of both clothing and food items and pointed out that there was a dwindling in the sale of potatoes and big onions. Mr. Fernando said this could be verified by checking Custom reports.
He said Sri Lanka, which had an agro-based economy, was hit by the adverse weather conditions for the second consecutive year and this too affected the peoples purchasing power.
Commenting on the impact of the rupee depreciation, he said though the World Market prices of sugar had come down, the local wholesale and retail prices could not be reduced because of the drop in the rupee value against the US dollar.
He said the world market price of sugar which was US$600 per tonne, had dropped to US$480 per tonne.
But the local prices cannot be reduced decause of the depreciation of the rupee. India has opened up its export market. Many years ago when the world price was US$ 600 per tonne, we sold sugar at Rs.99 a kilo locally. Today, the price has come down but selling sugar locally at the same price, he said.

Russia, Iran, warn Trump they will retaliate militarily if US crosses red line
	

(Daily Mail, London), 10 April 2017 - 
Russian and Iranian forces last night warned Donald Trump they would retaliate with military action if he launched more airstrikes on Syria. 
In an ominous threat raising the prospect of war, they said the US President had crossed a red line with his surprise missile bombardment on Bashar al-Assads forces. 
From now on we will respond with force to any breach of red lines and America knows our ability to respond well, the military chiefs said in a joint statement with militant group Hezbollah.The Russian Embassy in London suggested on Sunday night there could be real war if Moscow was presented with an ultimatum over Syria. 
But UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson will lead a push on Monday for Russia to face tough new sanctions unless it withdraws its support for Assad. At a G7 meeting in Italy, Johnson will call for Moscow to be threatened with isolation from the international community and a raft of economic punishments.

SAITM has MBBS students with 3 ordinary passes in bio stream
	
There are MBBS students at the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) with only three ordinary passes in the biology stream at the GCE (A/L), SAITM said today.
SAITM Registrar Husni Hussain told the Daily Mirror that these students had joined SAITM prior to the gazetting of the minimum standards by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) in August 2011.
In 2011, the SLMC laid down the minimum standards for the private education sector as two credit passes and an ordinary pass. Till then we have enlisted students only with three ordinary passes. There are several students in three batches at SAITM with three ordinary passes for GCE (A/L), she said.
Ms. Hussain said SAITM was enlisting students for the MBBS degree programme with minimum two credit passes and an ordinary pass since 2011 up to present and were willing to do so even in the future.
However, the SLMC has recently announced that the minimum qualification for student admission to a Government or Private medical college should be at least two credit passes and an ordinary pass in the biology stream at the GCE (A/L), according to the minimum standards prepared by them.

They too were young once!
	

A youth convention organized by a political party was held quite recently.

However, a strong presence of middle-aged persons was conspicuous among the youths brought to the convention by a youthful politico from Wayamba.
One of his colleagues having observed this incongruity had asked the Wayamba politico why he had brought the middle-aged persons to the youth convention.  
The politico from Wayamba had replied: I could not round up enough young chaps. After all, these middle-aged ones too were once young fellows!

Uniformed Excise sleuths baffled over Chief Auditor's Avurudu treat
	
Some 900 uniformed staff members of the Sri Lanka Excise Department are bewildered and agitated over a decision taken by the departments Chief Auditor to collect all raided liquor stocks from countrywide stations and distribute them only among its headquarters clerical staff at a concessionary rate during the upcoming Avurudu season.
The sudden move was described as unfair and discouraging for all uniformed staff members, who are committed to a round the clock service to bust any unlawful sale of government licensed liquor or detect instances of violations of the Excise Ordinance, the sources said.
Excise Department Chief Auditor (Excise Commissioner) S A S Wickramaratne has issued a circular on March 8, 2017 to all 12 Assistant Excise Commissioners based countrywide ordering to collect the stocks of seized liquor products through raids and be sent to the Excise Headquarters before March 27.
It had been mentioned that the move was aimed at distributing the seized liquor products among the clerical staff of its headquarters at a discounted rate.
Excise stations situated countrywide under 12 Excise Assistant Commissioner Divisions conduct routine detections on each and every licensed liquor store, restaurant, bar, supermarket to find whether they violate Excise license conditions in carrying out their sales.
Taking details of violation of Excise license regulations is called a TCR or Technical Crime Report. If one of those premises was ound guilty of violating the license regulations a fine could be imposed in addition to seizing all its unaccounted liquor stocks or bottles.
These seized liquor stocks are then usually sold among the officials who undertook or took part in the detections at a special concessionary rate. This has been a long term practice in the department and was also considered as a gesture to encourage the staffers who were committed to their service.
A senior official who spoke on the condition of anonymity disclosed to the Daily Mirror that this usual practice of the department has been disregarded this year with no ethical reason, with the arbitrary decision of the departments Chief Auditor.
The uniformed staff shed their sweat and blood out in the field to conduct these detections but they would not get anything as an encouragement, whereas the clerical staff that is stationed at the head office gets all the perks, he claimed.
As a result all stocks of liquor had been sent to the headquarters prior to the mentioned deadline and a number of vehicles had been dispatched from the headquarters merely for this purpose.
The concerned officials questioned how difficult it was to get fuel allowances passed for their station vehicles required for daily duties of raids and detections, whilst the Chief Auditor had allowed vehicles to Jaffna, Badulla, Anuradhapura, Ratnapura, Wennappuwa, Kalutara and Gampaha offices just to collect these stocks.
Scores of Excise uniform staff ranging from Superintendents, Chief Inspectors, Inspectors, Sergeant Majors, Sergeants, Corporals, Guards and Drivers who are utterly unhappy over this unfair decision are thinking of resorting to action of informing the Ministry of Finance and the Excise Commissioner General about this.
When contacted, Excise Commissioner General L K G Gunawardena told the Daily Mirror that this was not a new thing and had been happening for the past decade. He said the purpose of selling sized stocks to its employees at a discounted rate was to generate revenue for the government.
If there was such an unfair scenario within the department then the aggrieved parties should first complain it to the department heads instead of informing the media, the Commissioner General further said. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

Where did he find all that money
	

A prominent politico raising a big ruckus over the injustice of certain colleagues of his being harassed by the FICD had reportedly sold for Sterling pounds 470,000 a mansion he had purchased in Britain for Sterling pounds 320,000.

This politico, a popular public orator, who usually goes about dressed in tie and coat had started life on a mediocre career, but had become filthy rich overnight after taking to politics, they say.
He had taken the lead in recent times in making corruption allegations against a number of leading politicians, but he himself is facing an inquiry into an allegation of misuse of public funds against him.
