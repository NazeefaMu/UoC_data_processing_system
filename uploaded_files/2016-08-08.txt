Another irregular Rs. 40 million Krrish transaction found - FCID
	
Another Rs. 40 million transaction by the Krrish Company to purchase a land in Puttalam was found while investigating the Rs. 70 million transaction between the company and Namal Rajapaksa, the FCID said at the Colombo Fort Magistrate Court today. ?
The prosecution said they had identified four suspects including Nalaka Godahewa (former Chairman of the Securities Exchange Commission) over the alleged deal and said the property was allegedly sold under a forged deed by the four suspects to the company.
The alleged deal was revealed when the FCID investigated a complaint filed by JVP Provincial Councillor Wasantha Samarasinghe earlier.
Meanwhile two others, Roni Ibrahim and Rukshan Fernando, have been summoned to the FCID to record statements regarding the Rs. 70 million transaction.
A statement given by the accountant for the Carlton Super Sports Ltd, Sujani Bogollagama, regarding the misappropriation of Rs. 70 million given by Krrish to conduct a rugby tournament, revealed that both Ibrahim and Fernando were aware of how the funds were spent by the CSS ltd, the prosecution said.
The final report of the case was sent to the Attorney General for his opinion, the FCID said.

Brother abducts sister: Demands Rs. 7 lakhs ransom
	
A 17-year-old boy who hid his own sister and demanded Rs.700,000 from his father over the phone with a changed voice was arrested by the Gampaha Police.
The suspect was the eldest in the family of three children. Police said his mother had gone abroad for employment leaving the children in the care of their father.
His father told police that his son who wanted Rs.500,000 to form a music group was displeased with him when it was refused. He said his 15-year-old daughter had gone missing after she went to a nearby boutique and that he searched for her with the help of the neighbours but to no avail. He said even the suspect joined the search. He stated to police that he received a call demanding a ransom of Rs.500,000 to release his daughter.
However, when the Women and Children?s Bureau of the Gampaha Police initiated investigations of his complaint, the disappeared girl returned home at about 9pm on Saturday (6) and told her father that the abductors who kept her at a house in an unknown area brought her by trishaw and left at the junction.
When the police questioned her at length, she made a clear breast of the incident and told that her brother took her to one of her friend?s house. The suspect young man admitted that he planned to get a ransom from his father who refused his request for Rs.500,000 to organize a music group.(Tilakaratne Dissanayake)

CFA Society Asia-Pac Chief stresses ethical conduct in Sri Lanka?s capital markets
	
Sri Lanka?s capital market is still at an early stage of development and therefore the establishment of a strong culture of ethical conduct is of paramount importance for faster growth in the market, according to the regional head from the world?s top association of investment professionals.?
?The maturity of Sri Lankan capital markets is at its early stages and establishing a strong culture of ethical conduct is essential,? said CFA Institute Asia Pacific Managing Director Nick Pollard.?
Unlike in developed and some of the East Asian markets, Sri Lanka?s capital market does not reflect a cross section of the economy as only 294 companies are listed and the total market capitalization accounts for only 30 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2015. ?
Stock market capitalization in Hong Kong is 1,078 percent of its GDP while it is 264 percent in Singapore. The Malaysian capital market is 148 percent of GDP, while in India it is 69 percent.?
Stock market capitalization of about 50 percent of GDP is generally considered as a well developed and a matured market but is always not the case.?
?The diversity, size and professionalism of institutional investors will be key in determining how fast and large the capital market in Sri Lanka can grow,? Pollard said speaking at the CFA Society Sri Lanka capital market awards held recently. The perennial issue in Sri Lanka?s capital market is the retail investors lack the confidence in the market as they repeatedly burnt their fingers in the past due to stock market manipulation in the form of alleged acts of insider trading and pump and dump schemes carried out by a mafia of high-net-worth investors but the country?s capital market regulator lacks teeth in bringing the perpetrators into books.?
Probes on earlier identified 17 market manipulators during the 2010-11 Bull Run saw Sri Lanka?s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) losing two chairpersons in less than a year. ?
However, the SEC is now amending its decades-old Act allowing them to prosecute any party in a civil court.
Further, unlike in the government securities market, Sri Lanka?s capital market consisting?
of only equity and corporate debt lacks?
liquidity, which also acts as a deterrent in market development.?
The move to increase public free float in a bid to increase liquidity has made a mockery of its own as listed companies are seen dubiously keeping their stakes among the promoters or under Special Purpose Vehicles and those who did not see the value of remaining listed got themselves de-listed backfiring the free-float rule.?
The proposal to list partial stakes in large state-owned-enterprises (SoEs) has been there for so many years but to no effect.?
Currently Sri Lanka?s capital market lacks the diversity in investment instruments in the likes of derivates and also the investors as the market is still largely controlled by an elite few.?
The Colombo Stock Exchange in a welcome move recently established a long awaited Central Counterparty for all secondary market transactions.?
With the interest rates remaining high Sri Lanka?s stock exchange currently goes through a bad period but lately the market saw some returning of foreign inflows but year-to-date net outflows still remains above Rs.4.0 billion.?
When bank borrowings remain expensive, capital market opens up an avenue for the corporates to raise relatively cheaper capital.

Fitch assigns Senkadagala Finance?s senior debt final ?BBB+(lka)?
	
Fitch Ratings has assigned Senkadagala Finance PLC?s (SFC: BBB+(lka)/Stable) issue of senior unsecured redeemable debentures of up to Rs.3 billion a final national long-term rating of ?BBB+(lka) ?.
The final rating is the same as the expected rating assigned on June 13, 2016 and follows the receipt of documents conforming to information already received. The amount has been increased to Rs.3 billion from Rs.2 billion.
The debentures will have tenors of two to four years and carry fixed and floating coupons. The debentures are to be listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange and the company plans to use the proceeds to fund loan growth, diversify its funding mix and reduce structural maturity mismatches.
The proposed debentures are rated at the same level as SFC?s national long-term rating as they will constitute direct, unconditional, unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of SFC.
SFC?s rating reflects the satisfactory credit profile that it has maintained through economic cycles, its relatively strong franchise amongst finance companies in Sri Lanka and access to longer-term institutional funding. These are counterbalanced by its deposit franchise and capitalisation, which are weaker than higher-rated peers.
The rating on the proposed debentures will move in tandem with SFC?s national long-term rating.

NUTA secretary Dr. Channa Jayasumana, who is a lecturer at the Rajarata University, told Daily Mirror yesterday that this was a falsehood and that he, along with other university academics attached to his organisation, would prove it with facts and figures.
?This is a false story created by those sympathising with the cause of the LTTE. We can academically prove that 40,000 civilians were not killed. It is an allegation cooked up by a section with vested interests,? he said.
He said NUTA would also campaign against the government's move to enact the Office of Missing Persons Bill in Parliament.

## Section: Financial News
## Date: 8 August 2016 12:00 am
Pan Asia Bank June quarter net up 10% to Rs.300mn
	
The licensed commercial bank, Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC saw its net profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 (2Q16) increasing by a modest 10 percent to Rs.299.8 million or Rs.4.08 a share from a year ago but the growth in the loan book slowed amid narrowing margins, the interim results showed.?
The net interest income grew by 18 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs.1.15 billion but the rise in interest expenses exceeded the growth in interest incomes for the period as the rise in interest rates took a toll on the bank?s funding cost as the deposits had to be re-priced higher, the bank said in a note.?
During the six months ended June 30, 2016 (1H16), the lender expanded its loan book by little over 6 percent or Rs.5.5 billion to Rs.91.8 billion.?
Gold-backed loans grew by Rs.1.26 billion during the period.?
The bank however was seen funding its total growth in loans through the customer deposits as such deposits grew by 7.06 percent or Rs.5.9 billion to Rs.83.6 billion.?
The low-cost deposits, current and savings account ratio took a steep fall to 23 percent from 28 percent in December 2015 as the bank?s mid-term deposits has grown while the savings and current accounts falling as some of the low-yielding savings shifted to higher-yielding fixed deposits.?
This resulted in higher funding cost to the bank, which dented the net interest margin to 4.11 percent from 4.34 percent in December 2015.?
Meanwhile, the fee and commission-based incomes have grown by a strong 38 percent YoY to Rs.249.6 million mainly due to the credit-related fee incomes, the bank said.?
The net gains from trading almost halved to Rs.54.7 million from a year ago due to the rise in gilt securities leading to fair value losses in the bank?s trading book.?
Other operating income fell by 12 percent YoY to Rs.127.6 million probably due to the adverse impact from the revaluation of the foreign currency reserves.?
The provisions made for possible bad loans in respect of individual customers rose by 124 percent YoY to Rs.145.4 million but the provisions made on the entire portfolio ? collective impairments ? turned a reversal of Rs.54.3 million from a provision of Rs.170.7 million a year ago reflecting the improved quality of the portfolio.?
The gross non-performing loans ratio slightly fell to 4.39 percent from 4.84 percent six months ago due to continuous efforts by the bank on recovery and rigid credit risk management policies.?
Although there is a slight improvement in the capital adequacy ratios from December 2015 ? Tier I at 7.88 percent and Tier II at 11.53 percent ? both ratios are nearing regulatory minimums of 5 percent and 10 percent, respectively requiring a fresh capital injection.?
The bank?s Tier I capital stands at Rs.5.9 billion but the Central Bank is soon expected to issue a directive asking banks to raise Tier I capital up to either Rs.15 billion or Rs.20 billion.?
With thin margin of safety between the bank?s capital adequacy and the regulatory minimums, the growth will be soon capped in the absence of fresh capital, the banking sector analysts have been saying.?
Meanwhile, for the 1H16 the bank posted a net profit of Rs.603.7 million or Rs.4.10 a share, an increase of 34 percent from the same period last year.?
Business tycoon Dhammika Perera held a 29.99 percent stake in the bank as of June 30, 2016.

True leader of SLFP: Vote on VAT Bill will decide, says PHU
	
The Parliament vote on the VAT Bill would act as an Ordeal (Agni Pareeksha) to decide whether the true leader of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) is President Maithripala Sirisena or Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) said today.
PHU General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila said the President, in Polonnaruwa, had expressed his views against any tax increment which would be a heavy burden on the citizens.
On the other hand, he said the Premier had said the tax increments were needed to fulfil conditions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
?Therefore, the SLFP faction in the government which follows the President?s orders should vote against the Bill. But, if SLFP MPs accept the leadership of Prime Minister instead, they could vote for the Bill. This voting would decide who the real leader of the SLFP ministers is,? he told a news conference.
The MP said the Minister had no knowledge about the plight of the VAT revision and charged the inclusion of the private medical services in the VAT spectrum was a blow to the citizens, specially the senior citizens, who need health care constantly.
?Most of the senior citizens rely on their children as they don?t have a proper income. Blood tests, urine tests and other tests are not strange to them. They are the ones who undergo surgeries mostly. Today, senior citizens are in distress because their monthly expenditure for healthcare had been increased by 15 per cent,? he said.
He recalled that the Supreme Court order suspended the VAT increment and said therefore, the people heaved a sigh of relief even it was temporarily. ?Now we can see who really takes care of the people,? he said.
He said the opinion of the Supreme Court would be presented in Parliament today (9) and presumably, the Court would order to obtain the Cabinet consent for the VAT amendment Bill before presenting in Parliament. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Wigneswaran urges NE re-merger
	
Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran insisted that the government should re-merge the Northern and Eastern provinces on the basis that they were the cultural homelands of the Tamils.
?The government should take action to re-merge the North and East, the only cultural homelands of the Tamil people,? he told a briefing at the Jaffna Library on Sunday following a meeting of the Tamil People's Council.
Mr. Wigneswaran said Muslims were objecting to the re-merger and the government was making use of it for their advantage and side-stepping the issue. He said the government should be strong enough to overcome any challenges and the Muslim people have no reason to object to the re-merger of the North and East.
