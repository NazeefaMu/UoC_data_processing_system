British tourist raped in SL hotel denied compensation
	
A British tourist, who was allegedly raped at a luxury hotel in Sri Lanka during a holiday to the island in 2010, had been denied compensation by the UK Court of Appeal today, the Daily Mail reported.
According to Daily Mail, the woman was on holiday with her husband at a hotel in the South-west of Sri Lanka when she was allegedly attacked by a uniformed hotel employee.
The victim told court that the man lured her into an engineering room in the hotel's grounds and held her by the throat as he assaulted and forced himself on her.
The 30-year-old woman from Glasgow, was diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection after her return to the UK. After she discovered she was pregnant, she had to undergo checks to ensure that the child was her husband's and not the rapist's.
She had sued tour company, Kuoni Travels Ltd, through which she booked the 2010 package tour to one of Sri Lanka?s prestigious resorts on the South-West coast.
However, senior judges in London have ruled that neither Kuoni nor the hotel could be blamed for the electrician's crime.
The Master of the Rolls, Sir Terence Etherton, has said the attacker was of previous good character and no similar complaints had been made against him. The hotel had taken up his references before employing him and neither the hotel nor Kuoni could have predicted the sex attack.
Claiming ?29,000 damages on her behalf, the woman's lawyers argued that Kuoni should be held liable under package tour regulations.
However, Sir Terence has said the travel company had 'no direct relationship' with the attacker, who was a hotel employee and the hotel had no reason to suppose, going by his past history, that he might rape one of their guests.
Sir Terence concluded, 'Although we have great sympathy for Mrs. X in relation to her ordeal and its consequences... we would dismiss this appeal.?

## Title: De-gazetting Nature Reserves: What We Stand To Lose

De-gazetting Nature Reserves: What We Stand To Lose
	
Sri Lanka can boast of a diverse coastline, which is ecologically and economically valuable. Our shores provide livelihoods to many people, and act as our first line of defence in case of natural disasters. The fisheries they support also act as an important source of nutrition. When a natural ecosystem provides invaluable services to people as well as fauna and flora, it is afforded protected status. The efficient management of these Protected Areas (PAs) ensures that these benefits can be sustained for generations to come.? ?
Gazetting of Wedithalathive Nature Reserve
Wedithalathive is a small town situated on the coast, accessed by the Mannar-Jaffna A32 highway. On 25 February 2016, Wedithalathive?s ecosystems were given legal protection by its declaration as a Nature Reserve under the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance. This was carried out just 2 years ago by the Department of Wildlife Conservation, and gave protection to mangroves, sea-grass beds and coral reefs situated in the area. These natural ecosystems have been recognized worldwide for their importance in maintaining ocean productivity.? ?
Proposed Aquaculture Park
According to the Environmental Foundation Limited (EFL) as well as published sources, a cabinet paper has been prepared to excise and de-gazette approximately 1000 hectares of land from this newly declared reserve, in order to establish a commercial Aquaculture park. The paper was co-proposed by both the Minister of Fisheries and the Minister of Sustainable Development and Wildlife, with the recommendation of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management. The proposed Aqua-park is slated to yield a commercial harvest of fish and shellfish, especially prawns, for export.? ?
This raises many red flags, as pond-based prawn farming has not been a success story in Sri Lanka and elsewhere in Asia. In fact, a closer look at the area just South of Wedithalathive, in Puttalam and Mundal, show large tracts of prawn farms abandoned in the last 30 years due to disease outbreaks and unsustainable practices.? ?
In an Aqua-park, the landscape is created for artificial breeding of economically important fishery species. Land units are leased to aquaculture farmers, and these units include purpose built ponds and facilities for seawater take and discharge. The park should also have wet-laboratories and hatcheries, intensive culture facilities, and dry-laboratories, for quality assurance and updated research purposes. Overall, stringent scientific standards must be met if an Aqua-park is to be successful.? ?
However, in practice, the execution of such projects is difficult due to the complex variables that need to be considered, and de-gazetting Protected Areas for such commercial ventures is a dangerous precedent to set, as the impacts may outweigh the benefits.? ?
Environmental Impacts
The United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) and many other research bodies around the world have shown a strong correlation between intact natural ecosystems and protection from natural disasters. The stretch of mangroves, sea-grass beds and patchy coral reef running up the coastline of the Wedithalathive Nature Reserve provides the crucial service of regulating coastal flood events, protecting against storms and preventing the erosion of the sandy shore. They also provide protection against coastal disasters such as tidal waves.? De-gazetting of the Reserve means that natural vegetation will be cut down to make way for ponds and tanks, similar to the devastation caused by aquaculture ventures in other parts such as Puttalam. This leaves the coastline and the villages more exposed to natural disasters.??
The Wedithalathive Reserve and the ecosystems in the adjoining Vankalai Sanctuary also supports important biodiversity in Sri Lanka, such as wading birds and crustaceans, and the habitat crucial for the survival of these species may be lost. Additionally, this area is an important feeding ground for thousands of migratory birds that winter in Sri Lanka, and this may lead to severe human-wildlife conflict if an Aquapark is established here.? ?
Socioeconomic Impacts of De-gazetting
From a purely economic perspective, many would argue that creating jobs for rural communities and earning more revenue through foreign exchange take precedence over protecting endangered animals in a delicate ecosystem. However, the EFL reports that sacrificing Nature Reserves and protected areas in order to carry out Aqua-park operations will lead to unmitigated disasters that will affect both the vulnerable communities living in these areas, in addition to the delicate coastal ecosystems.? ?
According to a research carried out by EFL, many local communities will directly feel the impacts of pollution through discharge of contaminated water from the Aqua-park, and the resulting loss in productivity in natural ecosystems. The report states there are many fishers currently engaging in near-shore artisanal fishery and off-shore commercial fishery in the area, who stand to lose their livelihoods due to pollution and loss in productivity.? ?
This is because many commercially viable species use mangroves, sea-grass beds and reefs as their breeding and spawning grounds, ensuring that our oceans keep getting a fresh stock of commercially important marine species. The traditional fishers of the area are able to bring in their catches of shrimp, crab and fish because of the service provided by these mangrove and coral reef ecosystems. If productivity of these ecosystems were lost, the offshore fishing industry of the area would collapse.? ?
Alarmingly, the community may also face shortages of freshwater in the future, as aqua-parks require a steady supply of freshwater to maintain salinity. The ground water table of the arid zone may become imbalanced due to these withdrawals.? ?
A Strong EIA Required
Following the presentation of the proposal, the cabinet of ministers have instructed relevant officials to conduct a feasibility study and provide an Environmental Impact Assessment Report (EIAR), prior to providing the approval for the project.? ?
It is extremely important to ensure that a strong EIA is carried out, encompassing all aspects such as biodiversity protected by the Reserve, ecosystem services and values to the community, negative externalities which may be created by an Aquapark and the opportunity costs of the venture. The right experts need to be contacted, and a thorough assessment must be carried out in an accountable manner before any decisions are made.? ?
The terrestrial portion of the Wedithalathive Nature Reserve is not just a barren land with a few bushes. It is a living ecosystem, which provides crucial services for humans and for animals. Grasping for foreign exchange through any means necessary will only lead to destitute communities, ravaged ecosystems, wasted investments and abandoned ventures.? ?

Deserves National Recognition
	
Sangharaja Welivita Saranankara Thera
Sri Lanka should have celebrated the 415th Birth Anniversary of Sangharaja Welivita Sri Saranankara Thera as much as the bringing of Upasampada to Sri Lanka in 1753. If not for Sangharaja Wellivita, Sri Lanka would not have been a Buddhist country.??
The Sangharaja was born at Tumpane in June 1698 of the Christan era, but the birth date cannot be verified. The birth is referred to as the fifteenth year during the reign of Vimaladharmasuriya II on the seventh day in the dark half moon of the month of Poson. Some say it is the 16th and others say it could be the 19th of June 2005.??
But, there is no doubt that Buddhism?s renaissance commenced with the entry of Ven. Welivita Sri Saranankara as a monk, who later was bestowed with the Title of Sangharaja by King Kirthi Sri Rajasinghe.? ?
During the celebrations of the 250th year of bringing Upasampada to Sri Lanka millions were spent, but the birth place remained in the state as shown in the photograph.??
The fact remains that the birth place of the Sangharaja should be made a National Monument or as the residents of the area point out that the entire complex, which includes the Cultural Centre, the Pansala, the Buddhu-ge and the premises where the the Sangharaja and Kithsiri Rajasinghe had planted two Bo-trees should be made into a Sacred Area.??
It is time that the the Government or the Archaeological authorities took action to preserve the Birth place of this monk, without whom there would be no Buddhism in?
Sri Lanka.? ?
?
BACKGROUND
Before the Sangharaja entered monkhood and in the renaissance of Buddhism, there were a group of monks, who were titled ?Ganninnansa?s?. The Sangharaja opend up the ?Silvata?s Assocation? the forerunner to this renaissance. A fantastic amount of money running into millions of rupees had been spent a few years back on the 250th Anniversary commemorating the bringing of Upasampada to Sri Lanka, which transformed the Maha Sangha which was an exercise of the the Sangharaja. But, the very place where Sangharaja Weliwita Asarana Sarana Saranankara was born, the Temple where the Thera resided at Welivita and Vihare remains in a dilapidated condition even up to this very moment.??
More over where the very Vihare where Sangharaja used to come and meditate and pray is in utter neglect.??
Trekking nearly 20 kilometers this scribe has made his way to Sangharagapura several times, more so as a pilgrimage to the village of Welivita in the Tumpane Divisional Secretary?s Division on a road that needs repair. Every time the visit has brought heart burns to this scribe, that none of the agencies all these years has taken an interest in this field of restoration of the birthplace of the Sangharaja. The house that Sangharaja Asarana Sarana Saranankara Welivita was born is in the most dilapidated condition, which is owned by one S.B.Weliwita, residing in Kandy. Some of the wooden pillars have been replaced by concrete pillars, but the doorways seems to intact. However the building needs repairs and conservation. S.B.Welivita, within his means has tried to ?do up? the house and the original wooden frames are intact, though the pillars are in concrete.??
This scribe spoke to S.B. Welivita, in Kandy working at the University of Peradeniya and he has a tale of woe. He said? a number of public servants and others have come over the years to write articles and also to see the place, but he is the one who even puts up a Buddhist Flag at this birth place during Veask, Poson and other Poya days. He said on Thursday that he was going to Sangharajapura to put up a Flag so that the younger generation would know. He said that this is done for the sake of the younger generation to least know that, ?Here lived a monk to whom credit should be given for the upliftment of Buddhism in Sri Lanka?. This is only one aspect of this most regretful history that has befallen to a Thera who should be venerated daily in Buddhist homes and looked upon as the saviour of the Buddha Sasana.? ?
Venerable Asarana Sarana Saranankara Welivita Thera was instrumental in a renaissance of Buddhism in the country, when there was not a single member of the Sangha who was ordained in the ?Upasampada Karamaya ? or Higher Ordination. Several attempts to bring the Upasampada failed until during King Kirthi Sri Rajasinghe?s period. Upasampada was brought by a delegation headed by Maha Thera Upali.??
Venerable Welivita was born in this remote village of Welivita named as Kulatunge Banda, whose father was Kiri Banda a farmer. At the age of 12, the young Kulatunge Banda was entrusted to Venarable Suriyagoda Rajaguru to be ordanied a monk at Suriyagoda in the now Yatinuwara electorate. It is from here that he had his basics on Buddhism and went in search of a inner dimensions of Buddhism at a time when there was no books or scholars.??
A cave at Balane was his place of meditation and lived in cave close, both which could be located. The two caves are separated by the Kandy-Colombo railway track. But, without so much of a sign to indicate that this Venerated member of the Sangha lived or meditated there.??
The irony of the whole situation is that though the then government spent millions through the District Secretary at Kandy and other government functionaries, they did not have an iota of knowledge to even so much to indicate by erecting a plaque at these the places where this Thera lived, studied or meditated. No doubt,. he had been going around the country in order to enlighten the people and the monks.??
The Ven. Thera should be recognised not only during celebrations but throughout by the Buddhist public.??
There was a time, when the officers of the State banished Venerable Asarana Sarana Welivita Thera without his knowledge, due to jealousy, to Laggala and was also nearly being beheaded for an alleged crime against the King at Malwatta Chapter.??
The irony of the whole situation is that though the then government spent millions through the District Secretary at Kandy and other government functionaries, they did not have an iota?of knowledge
However, when a wisecrack Brahamin came to the Kandyan Kingdom who went unmatched with arguments on Buddhism, the King sought the help of Venerable Welivita. The King was told that he was banished to Laggala, whereon, the King sent his own Palanquin to bring back Welivita Thera.??
At a time when discipline of the Sangha was at a low ebb, he formed what later came to be known as ?Silvatha? Association? which was the forerunner to these classes.??
As a last resort the King called upon a meeting at Poya Maluwa Vihare in Malwatta and selected the persons who should proceed on this errand to Siam (Thailand). In this five were selected was Wilbagedera. The Dutch released a Yatch named ?Tharka?. There were two ships that came, one was the ship supplied by the Dutch ?Taraka? and the Thai ship. Wilbagedera travelled in the Thai ship while others travelled in the the ship provided by the Dutch.??
The Thai delegation stayed at Godapola before they proceeded to Kandy and at Godapola, the Siamese Priests taught the Sri Lankan Pirests how to don the Robe and the finer points of the Upasampada ceremony.??
On Poya day of 1753, the first Upasampada was held, firstly on a member of the Thai delegation and secondly on Mahanayake Kobbekaduwa and later on Welivita Asarana Sarana Saranankara Thera. On this day Asgiri Sangha was not present for the first Upasampada. There were five pupils to the Sangharaja and the first been Venerabe Tibbotuwawe Sri Siddhartha Buddhraksitha Thera followed by?
The house that Sangharaja Asarana Sarana Saranankara Weliwita was born is in the most dilapidated condition, which is owned by one S.B.Weliwita, residing in Kandy.?
four others.? The Temple at Weliwita which is in a most dipilated state is surrounded by new buildings, but the old Temple has been saved. The credit must be given to the present member of the Sangha, as they have not touched this ?old? building, though a new building has been built close by. But, the ?old? Viharege and the pansala needs conservation and the attention of the government authorities. A question should be asked as to whether the Government agencies did not realise that the ceremonies to mark the 250th year of Upasampada or even the 2550th celebrations should have included Sangharajapurs Vihare or should have commenced by rehabilitating two ancient historic edifices, such as the Vihare and the birthplace. The monies spent have gone in the air and so much so that even a plaque has not been erected to name the palces where the Sangaraja lived or medidated.??
A cultural centre, which premises embraces two Bo-trees one planted by the Sangharaja and the other by King Kirthi Sri Rajasinghe was construted during on the instructions of Late President Premadasa and in the same premises in 1998 the Cultural Minister Lakshman Jayakody unveiled a statue of the Sangharaja.? ?

India to send Sacred Sarnath Buddhist relics for Vesak
	
The sacred Buddhist relics of Sarnath, India will be sent to Sri Lanka on the occasion of Vesak, the Indian High Commission in Colombo said today.
The statement said this is the first time these Sacred Relics are being brought to Sri Lanka from India, and special arrangements have been made by the Indian government for this purpose. The public can pay homage to these Relics at Temple Trees from April 28 to May 2, 2018.
The Sacred Relics of Sarnath are yet another manifestation of the shared Buddhist heritage of India and Sri Lanka, which forms a spiritual bond between our two nations. These Relics are enshrined at Mulagandhakuti Vihara at Saranth in India. Sarnath is historically significant since Lord Buddha preached his first sermon there. Anagarika Dharmapala, founder of the Maha Bodhi Society of India, played a key role in building Mulagandhakuti Vihara to restore the glory of Sarnath. The land and the Sacred Relics were gifted to the Maha Bodhi Society of India by the Government of India.
A specially made casket secures these two most revered and authentic Relics. The first Relic, enclosed within the silver casket enshrined in Vihara, were found by Sir John Marshall in 1913-14 near the ancient city of Taxila (Takshasila). They were found in a small Buddhist chapel close to the Dharmarajika Stupain, a silver reliquary with inscriptions dating the year 136 (circa 79 A.D). They were recorded as the relics of the Blessed One.
The second Relic enshrined at Sarnath was found by A. H. Longhurst of Archaeological Survey of India in 1929 in a large Stupa at Nagarjunakonda in the Guntur District of the then Madras Presidency. The Stupa in which the Relic was found is described as the Maha Chetiyaor viz. the 'Great Stupa' of the Blessed One.
The High Commission of India thanks the Mahabodhi Society of India for loaning these Sacred Relics for exposition in Colombo.
This is the second time that the High Commission has taken an initiative to exhibit the sacred relics of Lord Buddha in Sri Lanka. The first time such initiative was the exhibition of the Kapilavastu Relics in 2012.

Indo-Lanka Accord needs modifications
	
Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake, in an interview with Daily Mirror, speaks about political reforms of the UNP. He shared the following:-
A new face will benefit any political party?
	It can be Navin Dissanayake, Sajith Premadasa or Sajith-Navin combination
	Outlook?has to be changed to understand the needs of the party
	I have favourable opinion of Sajith Premadasa
	Leadership structure?has to be changed
?
?
?Q? There are talks about reforms to the UNP. What do you specifically expect in the name of reforms?There are certain ideas about reforms. The word that comes to my mind is change. There are certain changes that the party and its grassroots want. That is apparently felt by a lot of people. They are voicing their opinion. The party leadership structure must listen to these views and adapt. I still believe the UNP is a democratic party. It is the only party that has held four secret ballots. The latest one was held three weeks ago. I topped the list. I think it is imperative that there should be changes. It is not just artificial change. There should be real changes through a democratic process. Suitable people must be elected, not selected. The outlook of the party has to be changed to understand the needs of the party.? ?
The way the outsiders see the party should change. The party must genuinely work for the betterment of the country and people. This is the formula you need to win. If you don?t feel for the people and look after their interests, any party will decline. We hope that we can resurrect this great party.? ?
Devolution of power does not mean separatism. India has Federal system in a united country
?
?Q? As far as the UNP policies are concerned, how do you expect the changes to occur?
Both the main parties are now on the same track as far as economic policies are concerned. That is open market economic policies.??
?
?Q? Does it mean that the UNP does not need a departure from its policy on economic matters?
We have democratic socialism. Right now, some people believe our party is moving too much towards the right-liberal economic policies. After late President JR Jayewardene opened up the economy, the economy is still run on those principles. Basic income and expenditure must match. If you print money too much, inflation will rise. Right now, the country is in a huge debt burden. It is in a debt trap. When you earn a single rupee, 90 cents are used for debt repayment. You only have ten cents left for capital expenditure. How do we come out of this? You must go for higher growth. If the growth rate is sustained for a few years, it would have a rebound effect on the economy. You must identify the main sectors of development, the thrust areas like IT and infrastructure development, services, agriculture and tourism. Within them, you must open up the economy. Without opening up the economy, we cannot go on like this.? ?
?
?Q? How do you find this different from the kind of policies the UNP implemented during the last three years?
It is actually the same. From 1994 onwards, the UNP was in power only for two and-a-half years. It means the SLFP-led governments too have been there. They have been following the UNP policies. Within the open market policies, you have certain agendas. The SLFP- led governments put more money on social welfare. They give more relief to people. The UNP thinking is different. The UNP does not believe in all the time catering to the needs of people. We believe in the famous saying of Mao Zedong. That is to give a fishing rod instead of fish so that people can sustain themselves. People have a long-term view of income. You cannot have a social welfare state all the time without income. We have no income sources at the moment. But, people expect the government to give hand-outs. That cannot be the model. The model should be for high growth, opening up the economy, getting investment and prudent fiscal management. That is the UNP model.? ?
?Q? As for the ethnic conflict, the UNP has advocated power sharing or devolution. Do you seek a change of that policy?
Power sharing has always been a model for both the parties. In the past, there were Dudley ? Chelva Pact, Bandaranaike-Chelvanayagam pact etc. All were about power sharing. We took it to the next level with the 13th Amendment. After that, nothing has happened. If you go further than that, it has to be discussed. That is controversial. I know the Tamil parties want more than the 13th Amendment. If you go further, the government and people must have guarantees that there won?t be terrorism and ethnic violence again. What is the fine line when you go for devolution? Is it Federalism or beyond that? That is a mentally, intellectually stimulating debate.? ?
Devolution of power does not mean separatism. India has Federal system in a united country. The US is the same. Switzerland has its cantons. Here the situation is different. You have a movement for separatism. Then, you devolve power. Then, you keep on raising the bar. You are never happy with what you get. You keep raising the bar and asking more and more. I think Sinhala and Tamil people are tired of this.?
What went wrong is our support to the Norwegian initiative to broker peace. I think that was a big mistake. I was dead against the Norwegian-brokered ceasefire agreement with the LTTE
I would like to look at this in a new way. That is particularly for the north. There, you have a new model. You devolve more power only for the north, not the east. You cannot be asking power for the east. You cannot ask the north and the east to be merged.?
In 1987, my father, late Gamini Dissanayake was instrumental in drafting the Indo-Lanka Accord. Now, a lot of things have changed. One major change is that the Sinhalese and Muslims form the majority in the East do not want to be merged with the North. You cannot bring this matter to the negotiation table. If you need greater powers to Pradeshiya Sabhas, that is acceptable.??
Q Do you seek modifications to the Indo-Lanka accord?
Yes, of course. It is now 25 years for the accord. We have to look at it again. We have to improve it as well.? ?
?
?Q? There is a perception in the country that the UNP gives too much to the minorities and subject the majority community to step-motherly treatment. What is your view?
It is only a perception. It is a wrong perception. The victory of the UNP has come from the minority votes- Muslim and Tamil votes. The Sinhala ?Buddhist votes are also coming to the UNP. The SLFP-led front always gets the majority of Sinhala-Buddhist votes. That has always been the case. There is a slight drop in our Sinhala votes. That is the difference between the victory and defeat. We must espouse the Sinhala cause so that they do not feel that they are let down.? ?
?
?Q? What is the reason for such perception to be built in the country?
What went wrong is our support to the Norwegian initiative to broker peace. I think that was a big mistake. I was dead against the Norwegian-brokered ceasefire agreement with the LTTE. I expressed myself very strongly to the leader at that time. The raid on the Athurugiriya millennium house and letting down the military were badly managed political decisions. It really hurt the UNP.? ?
?
?Q? There is an allegation against the UNP even now regarding the victimization of war heroes?
I do not think that is justified. In the guise of war heroes, you cannot hide. If you have committed a crime, you cannot hide behind the war hero label. You have to be prosecuted if you have committed a crime. I am referring to the cases where army people were used for killing persons like journalists Eknelligoda, Lasantha Wickramatunga and others.?
One major change is that the Sinhalese and Muslims form the majority in the East do not want to be merged with the North
What happened in the war was a different issue completely. That is an international conspiracy against Sri Lanka. We know that. The Diaspora together with some foreign countries are directing a campaign against Sri Lanka. We know it for a fact. Lord Naseby (Baron Naseby who spoke for Sri Lanka at the House of Commons) has said it clearly. He said the total death toll at the war was 7000. Where did this figure of 40,000 come from? Who gave it? It is never a figure we can really on.? ?
?
?Q? It means you salute Lord Naseby...?
Yes, very much. I, in fact, congratulated Brigadier Priyankara Fernando. I wrote a letter to the two pro-LTTE MPs there. I condemned their behaviour. You must protect the security forces. You must stand by them. They did a tremendous job. No other Army, after the Burmese civil wars, has been able to suppress a terrorist organization. All these countries like Norway, some other Scandinavian countries, and the UK harp on Sri Lanka?s human rights records. It is very sad to note that those countries too have committed human rights violations.? ?
?
?Q? How is it possible for you to push for your party to adopt your line of thinking in this regard?
The UNP has always been such a big party. It accommodates all the opinions. One strength of Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe as the leader, is his ability to absorb all the opinions that are expressed. That is very healthy for a democratic party. We have so many debates and opinions. The important thing is to come to a centre point.? ?
?
?Q? You mentioned about the introduction of suitable members as office bearers to the party. Who are they actually?
Election of office bearers has to be there in any democratic party. The beauty of the American presidential system is that both the parties elect their candidates to run the presidential elections. It is very beautiful. When the Democratic Party had lost, there was pressure from the unions for the leader to step down.? ?
?
?Q? Do you see there is a need to change the party leadership?
The leadership structure has to be changed.?
One strength of Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe as the leader, is his ability to absorb all the opinions that are expressed. That is very healthy for a democratic party?
?
?Q? What about the individual holding the leadership?
I think the powers of the party leader can be given to the junior, emerging leaders. The party leader can take a back seat about certain issues. Under our party constitution, you cannot just throw out the leader. He has also to be respected. His dignity has to be maintained. There is a time in any organization for the head to step down.? ?
?Q? You said you won the secret ballot. Do you aspire to be the party leader?
I had fulfilled whatever the responsibilities which were vested upon me. I really do not go after positions. I do not think the leadership is about positions. In Sri Lanka, there is a culture of equating leadership with positions. When you are elected as a leader to a position, it is more important than being selected.? ?
?
?Q? If the party hand-picks you as the leader, are you ready to take it up?
Honestly, I have some time left. I have to mature a bit more. Whatever secondary role given to me, I will do it. It is not a pre-requisite for me to get a tag. It is more important for me to get the structure. If you get it, you are on a winning formula. I do not want to be in a losing party. If I am there in a losing party for the rest of my life, I will be out of power. If I am in a winning party, then, I can come up the ladder within the party. What is the point in seeking positions in a political party that is coming down in the national vote?? ?
The Sinhala-Buddhist vote base was rock-solid behind late President R. Premadasa and my father. That has been diluted a bit now
?
?Q? If you are chosen as the leader, could you revive the party?
In principle, a new face would benefit any political party. People want a new face. It does not mean it should be Navin Dissanayake alone. It could be Sajith Premadasa, Navin Dissanayake or a Sajith-Navin combination with some other young leaders. The UNP has enough of young talent. You have to give credit to Premier Wickremesinghe. He has managed to get the second tier of leaders.? ?
?
?Q? What is your opinion on Sajith Premadasa?
I have a very favourable opinion on him. I have worked closely with him. I do not see anything negative in him. Both of us should work for the benefit of the party.? ?
?
?Q? Which means as the leader and the deputy leader...???
That is up to the fate to decide? I cannot decide on that.??
People want a new face. It does not mean it should be Navin Dissanayake alone. It could be Sajith Premadasa, Navin Dissanayake or a Sajith-Navin combination with some other young leaders. The UNP has enough of young talent
?
?Q? What are the differences do you find between the present UNP and the UNP during the Gamini Dissanayake era?
At that time, the UNP did not go after regional leaders. The UNP had strong Muslim units. We did not go after other Muslim leaders. We were strong among the Tamils too. We had a very strong national identity. The Sinhala-Buddhist vote base was rock-solid behind late President R. Premadasa and my father. That has been diluted a bit now.? ?

Mid-air bomb threat: Lankan to face court for pre-sentence hearing
	
The Sri Lankan student who threatened to set off a bomb on board a flight from Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur is due to face court for a pre-sentence hearing, SBS News reported.
Manodh Marks, 26, forced Malaysia Airlines flight MH128 to turn back shortly after take-off in June 2017 when he started screaming that he had a bomb.
The student, who had been living in Dandenong, was overpowered by passengers and tied up until the flight landed at Melbourne Airport.
Police made passengers stay on the plane for almost 90 minutes before storming the aircraft and arresting Marks.
Officers copped criticism for taking so long to remove Marks, who had actually been holding what authorities called a "speaker-type" object.
Marks pleaded guilty to attempting to take control of an aircraft, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years behind bars.
He is due to face a plea hearing in the County Court on Thursday.

?Only one or two persons have opposed my appointment as the Assistant Leader. Therefore, it is not worth making any comment on it,?

## Title: Preparing for extradition if Mahendran is located: CID

Preparing for extradition if Mahendran is located: CID
	
The CID informed Court today that legal preparations are underway in relation with the extradition of former CBSL governor Arjuna Mahendran in the event if he is located in any country in which the current red notice of Interpol is applicable.
Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne also allowed the prosecution to get a comprehensive copy of the extractions of the current magisterial inquiry (a copy of the case file) so as to prepare the legal requirement in relation with the possible extradition of Mahendran.
Recently the Interpol issued a Red Notice for the search and arrest of former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran.
The prosecution said it?s a worldwide Red Notice applicable to 192 countries.
At the onset of the inquiry, the prosecution wanted to know whether there was any representation on behalf of the third suspect, Perpetual Treasuries Ltd as per the requirement of the law.
Previously, the Magistrate directed to issue notices on Perpetual Treasuries Ltd to send a representative to face the inquiry on its behalf as the company it self is the third suspect into the inquiry.
However, President's Counsel Kalinga Indatissa who appeared for the suspects informed that second suspect Arjun Aloysius is prepared to represent the third suspect (PTL).
The court on an earlier occasion held that there could be a possible conflict of interest if the fourth suspect Kasun Palisena represents on behalf of the company (PTL).
Considering the previous order the prosecution questioned how the conflict of interest could be avoided when Aloysius represents the Company and more over they questioned also about the interest that Aloysius actually has so as to represent the PTL.
PC Indatissa said according to the section 261 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the legal requirement is actually to produce anyone who is responsible to represent on behalf of the company. He said that Aloysius is the one who holds the shares of Perpetual Capital Holding which is the holding company of PTL.
At this point Magistrate asked whether Aloysius has any shares of PTL by his name. The answer of the PC was negative.
PC Indatissa maintained that they were assisting the prosecution by moving Aloysius as a representative on behalf of the company since the impractical nature of the company to send a person to represent itself in the inquiry. He said if the court is not satisfied with the representative moved by the defense then the inquiry can be proceed in the absence of a representative for the PTL.
In this inquiry Perpetual Treasuries Ltd is also the third suspect while other suspects are Arjuna Mahendran (first suspect), Arjun Aloysius (second suspect) and Kasuna Palisena (Fourth suspect).
However, PC Indatissa sought the court permission to tender further legal submission in this regard which is subsequently allowed by the court.
Meanwhile, the prosecution also wanted to know the stance of the defense with regard to the previous court orders that directed the PTL and the two suspects (Aloysius and Palisena) to provide a comprehensive list of their assets in a form of a report to the prosecution (the court said previously that the report is not regarded as a declaration which can be used as evidence in the inquiry).
However, PC Indatissa informed court that neither PTL nor Suspects are ready to provide such reports on their assets as it is not required by law. Citing legal precedents he said that Court can't ask from the defense to provide something which may be used against the suspects during the inquiry by the prosecution.
Considering the PC's request the court allowed him to file further written submission on this regard so as to make an appropriate order afterwards.
In the meantime, the Perpetual Treasuries Ltd owner Arjun Aloysius and its CEO Kasun Palisena were ordered to be re-remanded till May 10 by the court over the magisterial inquiry in which they were accused of abetting and conspiring with Arjuna Mahendran to misappropriate public funds worth Rs. 688 million during the Bond auction held on February 27, 2015.
Deputy Solicitor General Haripriya Jayasundara and Senior State Counsel Lakmini Giriyagama appeared for the state while PC Kalinga Indatissa and Counsel Jeewantha Jayathilake appeared for the suspects. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

President asks electrical engineers to halt their scheduled TU action
	
President Maithripala Sirisena today requested the electrical engineers to halt their scheduled trade union action on May 08, based on professional issues.
He said their issues would be taken up for discussion at the Cabinet and assured to provide a satisfactory solution.
He said this during a meeting on swift implementation of the long-term power generation plan held at the Presidential Secretariat yesterday.
The President gave instructions to the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka to take the necessary steps expeditiously to implement the long-term power generation plan for the time period of 2018-2037.
The Ceylon Electricity Board has prepared the long-term power generation plan, including the details of new Power Plants which should be constructed during the time period of 2018-2037 to meet the electricity demand of the country.
During the meeting, the President emphasized to the officials the necessity of prompt implementation of these works and further said that if there is obstacle to implement this plan, they should take steps to eliminate those obstructions by holding discussions.
President Sirisena further said that when paying attention to the issues, due consideration should be given to public conveniences and take steps in a humane manner.

President promises far reaching reforms to the party
	
President Maithripala Sirisena reportedly promised to introduce political reforms to Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) with a change of some office bearers between May 8 and 15, it is learnt.
The President made remarks to this effect at the SLFP Central Committee meeting on Tuesday evening. This was the first Central Committee meeting conducted after 16 members of the party decided to leave the national unity government.
These MPs insisted at the meeting that the remaining members should also leave the government and revitalize the party.
Besides, Uva Province Chief Minister Chamara Sampath Dasanayake also said the SLFP, as a party, should sever links with the government.
Those who relinquished their ministerial portfolios argued that Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake should be removed from the General Secretary post of the party.
The President said he would take initiatives for, far-reaching reforms to the party between May 8 and 15. (Kelum Bandara)

Protest staged by residents to mark one year
	
Sathyagraha campaign in Iranaithivu Island?
A demonstration had been organized on Monday (23) near the Catholic Church at Iranaimatha Nagar Beach to mark the completion of one year of the Sathyagraha campaign? by the original residents of Iranaithivu Island, who had lost their native lands for more than 26 years.?
The residents of Iranaithivu island and several voluntary organizations had participated in? this protest that had been organized opposite the Matha Nagar Catholic Church.? ?
The protestors said? they were deprived of the native lands in Iranaithivu island since 1992 due to the north-east war situation, but the attempts made by them to come back to their lands on several occasions had ended in failure . They also said, in spite of the fact that they were in the hope of receiving their lands after the war in 2009, the previous governments as well as the present government, have not taken any steps to give them any solution.? ?
They also said they had organized a Sathyagraha campaign in the year 2017 asking for their lands but no authority has focused their attention and taken any action on behalf of their demands so far. It is similar to an act of adding insult to injury of these residents who had been displaced due to the war.? ?
The protestors said there were about 200 families who lost their native lands in the Iranaithivu island due to the war before 26 years and at the time of losing their native lands, they had 125 houses and five drinking water wells, including a medical centre.? ?
At the end of the demonstration, they had met the officers of the Navy camp in Iranaithivu and explained their problem, in response to which the Naval officers had promised to discuss the matter with the Defence Ministry for a suitable solution.? ?

Radhika Coomaraswamy to speak on the Rohingya Crisis in Myanmar
	
Dr. Radhika Coomaraswamy will deliver a lecture on ?Myanmar: The Rohingya Refugee Crisis, Roots of the Conflict and Possibilities for the Future? at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute of International Relations and Strategic Studies (LKI) on Thursday, May 3. Dr. Coomaraswamy is a member of an independent three-person United Nations (UN) Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar. The UN Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar was appointed by the UN Human Rights Council in March 2017. Members of the Mission aim to present solid and comprehensive findings on the human rights situation in Myanmar from 2011 onwards -- particularly in the States of Rakhine, Kachin and northern Shan.? ?
The lecture will begin by covering the uncontested history of Myanmar, particularly to recount conflicts between the Myanmar government and ethnic minorities other than the Rohingyas. This would provide a backdrop on the nature of the Myanmarese state when dealing with minorities in general. The lecture will then cover the contested history of Rakhine state and the Rohingyas, as well as the history of legislation against them since independence. It will analyse two specific incidents that have given rise to international outrage?the events of October 2016 and, in particular, the events of August 2017. It will also cover some of the allegations that have been made, based on evidence from the testimonies gathered in Cox Bazaar that were part of the UN Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar. The lecture will conclude by reflecting on future trajectories on accountability and resettlement of refugees, and the future of Myanmar democracy. It will be followed by a Q&A session moderated by Dr. Dinusha Panditaratne, Executive Director of LKI.? ?
In addition to being a member of the UN Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar, Dr. Coomaraswamy serves on the Constitutional Council of Sri Lanka and was formerly Chairperson of the Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission. She has also been UN Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women and Under-Secretary-General and Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict. In 2014, Dr. Coomaraswamy was appointed by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon as the lead author of the 2015 ?Global Study on the Implementation of United Nations Security Council resolution 1325.?

16 rebels kept mum about sitting in Opposition: Samarasinghe
	
The SLFP rebel group of 16 who quit the ?Unity Government? after supporting the No Faith Motion against the Prime Minister did not raise a mummer about sitting in the Opposition as an independent SLFP group in Parliament from May 8 onwards, Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
Minister Samarasinghe said the final decision of the Central Committee that met at the official residence of President Sirisena on Tuesday (24) night despite their widely publicized grandiloquence to that effect, all 39 were to continue to sit as members of the SLFP Parliamentary Group under him.
Addressing the SLFP weekly news briefing at the party office yesterday, Minister Samarasinghe added that all other 23 members of the SLFP would fight for the benefit of the 16 rebels and keep them within the SLFP?s Parliamentary Group as one unit.
There were several rounds of talks with President Sirisena on Tuesday afternoon and eight former Cabinet Ministers met him first after the Cabinet meeting followed by 16 Ministers, State and Deputy Ministers at 5.00 p.m. Then after at 7.00 p.m. the entire SLFP Parliamentary group of 39 members met him and at 8.00 p.m the CC met.
The focus was on the reorganization of the party, the May Day rally and how to strengthen the SLFP to face the forthcoming Provincial Councils, Presidential and Parliamentary polls, Minister Samarasinge said.
Responding to Daily Mirror he said the impending Cabinet reshuffle or sitting as an independent group in Parliament by the rebel SLFP group of 16 Cabinet, State and deputy Ministers were not taken up for discussion at the CC.
However, Minister Samarasinghe added that if the Cabinet reshuffle comes sooner than later, it was good for the country and the ?Yahapalana Government? as it would dispel the uncertainty prevailing in the governance. He hoped that the Cabinet reshuffle would come in the next few days if not by next week. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

The consequences of building Port City
	
PMAPC Right of Reply to CHEC P.C. Colombo (Pvt) Ltd statement, published on March 20, 2018.? ?
We make reference to the statement above to clarify some issues muddled by the CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt) Ltd in response to the joint seminar held on February 28, 2018 by the Creation Care Desk of the Methodist Church and the PMAPC.? ?
?
EIA 2011 Coast Conservation Act?
This sorry saga begins with a slim so-called EIA in 2011, which fulfilled less than 20% of the legal requirements of EIA studies stipulated in Section 42 of the Coast Conservation Act No 57 of 1981. The development permit with its 72 conditions allegedly monitored by 26 Government agencies are a matter of private record and are not available to the public. Monitoring reports are deemed by the participating public institutions, the property of the CHEC Company and confidential. If the checks and balances are being made why has not one monitoring report been made public?? ?
?
Urban population?
The Urban population of Colombo stands to lose their health for generations to come as they suffer the consequences of high impact construction and the blocking of the flow of fresh air from the moment construction begins in the Colombo Port City. It is a proven fact that construction activities contribute massively to air pollution. This is exacerbated by land filling and vehicle emissions. All construction sites generate high levels of dust (typically from concrete, cement, stone, silica) which can carry for large distances over a long period of time.? ?
?
Air Pollution?
Currently toxic PM10 Fine Particles in the City of Colombo are at levels three times higher than what is safe for humans. With the proposed high-rise building constructions in the Port City over an estimated period of 12 to 15 years the PM 10 levels may increase 25-30 times more than what is considered safe for humans.? ?
Such an increase in PM 10 toxic particles will definitely increase the risk of getting respiratory and cardio vascular diseases, including lung cancer as detailed in WHO reports.? ?
Clearly this project is an unacceptable health hazard to the citizens of Colombo, the capital city of Sri Lanka.? ?
?
Unjust Deal?
The alleged benefits to the urban population are pie in the sky, but the benefit to the developer is assured for generations to come: Beginning with the landfill the rosy deal they have cut is a guaranteed 100% return within 3 years. The public however will suffer a net loss of not less than $11 billion. CHEC Company have invested $500 million and have obtained a loan of $1 billion. They will make a profit of not less? than $1.5 billion from the landfill. Sri Lanka supplies 65 million tons of sand at $2001- is $13 billion. 3.45 million cbm of granite rock @ $380/cbm$1.2 billion. ( December 2015, SEIA).? ?
?
State lands ordinance?
The State Lands Ordinance does not authorize the President to delegate his capacity under Section 60 (3) to reclaim any part of the foreshore of the bed of the sea. As the President has not authorized any lease as stipulated under section 61 of the State Land Ordinance, we assume that this is because this section says that the President must be sure ?that such a lease will not substantially prejudice the rights of the public? thereto.? ?
No Provision for Supplementary EIAs in Coast Conservation Act?
It is a matter of national importance and historical record that one project has needed much more than two EIAs repeatedly and allegedly addressing different aspects of the project in isolation and without an integrated examination of all inter-related impacts. The law does not identify compartmentalization of the EIA process in a single project. Further the word Supplementary EIA is not known in the Coastal?Conservation Act.? ?
?
Hidden Agenda?
There is no hidden agenda, but there exists an open public agenda to protect the well-being of generations living and yet to come.? ?
?
Prof. Karunaratna?s talk?
Prof. G P Karunaratna PhD, PE, FASCE has a PhD in Soil Mechanics from the Victoria University of Manchester was Adjunct Associate Professor at the NUS in Singapore. His response by email to the quarrels about his analysis in part says? ?
? ... There have been many references to the Port City Reclamation Projects. The effect of this reclamation on the ground water table of the adjacent land, when coupled with intense rainfall in the same area has been discussed with respect to the effect on some of the old buildings and other infrastructure in the said adjacent land.? ?
?It was elucidated last December to an audience comprising practicing engineers that, if proper drainage is not constructed and maintained certain despair would occur in those buildings and infrastructure ...? This is not scaremongering, but scientific research in Sri Lanka by a world-renowned expert on marine reclamation.? ?
?
Fisher folk livelihood support?
The right of the fisher folk to engage in a lawful occupation is violated with impunity with an allocation of Rs. 500 million for so-called fisher folk livelihood support and the use of those funds to split the fisher community in Negombo. This sum is an ad hoc allocation without study and with no basis in reality.? ?
?
Constitutional Infringments?
Our legal team have identified the following infringements under?the Constitution:? ?
Article 14: Freedom to engage in a lawful occupation: the Fundamental rights of the fishers are violated. This violation also extends to the Fundamental Rights of?generations unborn.? ?
Article 27(14) which requires the state to protect, preserve and improve the? environment for the benefit of?the community.? ?
Article 28 (f) each and every person is duty bound to protect nature and conserve its riches.? ?
?
Trust Doctrine?
All rulers and members of the executive hold the natural resources as a trust to be managed and utilized for generation unborn. They are not the owners. Natural resources are loaned from the future. See Bulankulama vs Secretary, Ministry of Industrial Development (2000) 3 SLR 243.? ?
?
Other Statutory Violations?
Coast Conservation Act 57 of 1981 Sections 4, 14, 15, 15 (b), 16? ?
?Ports Authority Act 51 of 1971: Sections 6, 7 & 74? ?
Change of extent requires a new comprehensive EIA? ?
Change of quantity from 65 million tons of sand to 70 million tons of sand needs new EIA? ?
National Environmental Act, Sand extraction illegal has to be authorized by GMSB.? ?
?Mines and Minerals Act 33 of 1992 Sections 26, 28,29,30,34 & 35? ?
The question that arises is the huge damage that has been done to our coastline due to both dredging and filling to alter the shore transport currents. There needs to be a thorough investigation on the legality and accountability of the parties to?the filling.? ?
But the reality is that we have an illegal filled area on the front of Colombo City. The damage that will be done to Colombo if high rise constructions are allowed is now obvious. If the Central Environmental Authority does not step in even at this last moment to protect our air quality, it will be a damning statement on their partiality.? ?
If high rises and high impact constructions will not be allowed, then what with?the landfill??
The alternate to high impact construction will be the establishment of building very high value, low rise, IT enabled, modern, health giving, Green City, the spectacular entry to Asia and the crown jewel of Colombo. We also encourage all Sri Lankans to send in suggestions as to what kind of city-we would like to have? Perhaps a national competition for what we would like to see on that land might be more? ? democratic than the current cabal of the Businessman-Bureaucrat-Politician.? ?

The Glyphosate Conundrum: The way out
	
The glyphosate (herbicide) issue arose a long time ago and is still going round and round. With so much evidence projected by both sides i.e. those that claim that it should be banned due to high risks and those that insist that there is no harm at all; no one seems to take any decision. There is no point in appointing a committee, however eminent the members are, just to ?look into it? and give a report. The simple way out of the conundrum is to carry out a local risk assessment.? ?
The Focal Point for this issue (Ministry of Environment? Ministry of Health?or H.E. The President?) should appoint a Risk Assessment Committee based on the perceived risks. For example, if the risk is to human health, there should be a Toxicologist in the committee and if there is a risk to the soil, then there must be a Soil scientist and a Soil Microbiologist. In addition, there should be experts on Weed science and on Weedicides. Other experts can be added or consulted as and when required, based on the hazard and the target of the hazard. The committee should consider only evidence based on good science from both parties and other sound scientific material from international agencies as well as local institutes.
The Risks should be assessed for each hazard per target and an overall Risk Assessment Report should be submitted with details of each hazard, exposure of the target to each hazard and possible consequences of such exposure. The committee can also request sound scientific evidence from the public as well. Public participation in the decision-making procedure is vital. The report which should be based on sound science only, should also provide Risk Management regimes, if necessary. Once the report is submitted to the Focal Point, an Advisory Committee (appointed by the Focal Point) should also consider other related concerns in addition to the Risk Assessment Report? are there any socio-economic issues? Will there be other issues related to the final decision? Why did other countries ban this? What alternative steps did they take? How do countries that use it, manage the risks and control its use? Will the decision to allow its use make it possible for other material such as genetically modified organisms that require large scale use of such herbicides to be brought to the country? Such concerns should also be considered together with the Risk Assessment Report and forwarded to the Focal Point for the final decision to be made. This is a really good and credible scientific procedure to follow. Otherwise the merry-go-round will continue and more and more will jump into it and/or some foreign expert will come and tell us what to do.??

## Title: The lost art of photography

The lost art of photography
	
The first in a series of articles delving into the art of photography in Sri Lanka
?The old-fashioned camera was clumsier and harder to reload than a brown Bess musket. The modern camera is trying to be a ray gun.??(Susan Sontag,?On Photography)
Photography, which captures an instant for all eternity, has never before been so democratised in Sri Lanka. More than ever before, interest in it has soared greatly. Schools are forming societies and students are taking to those societies faster than ever. Even the teachers chosen to head them, while not exactly professionals in the field, are transcending their lack of awareness of the subject by learning with those students; in effect, they approach the field on pretty much the same terms. But while photography has become democratised and has long since been freed from the straitjacket of film rolls and darkrooms, it has also become misconceived in the eyes of those who think that all you do is apply your eye on the gadget and click away to your heart?s content. Once an art form like this becomes entangled in commercial necessity, moreover, it gets into the hands of those who profit from it, and to this end, photography, ideal when used in so many different ways, is confined to your birthday and wedding. Predictably.??
Because filters are so readily available ? sometimes they?re IN the camera ? and because so many accessories can be purchased from the market at dirt cheap prices, the photographer tends to become lazy, and that by instilling in him an attitude of complacency. He or she no longer has to hassle around and control the environment he or she is in; the camera now does the job for him. Colours are lushly available, extravagantly so, and even when he resorts to monochrome, the effects are calculated to the dot because the camera can, or so the photographer believes, do everything for him. This is a field that developed the first time we, or rather our ancestors, stepped out of Plato?s Cave and encountered the world of mimesis, or material reality. We got obsessed with recording that reality, and the primitiveness of the technology of the first few cameras and camera firms helped us understand the reality we inhabited a way that modern cameras cannot.??
?
?
Making reality easier to bear?
The advantage with technology is that it makes that reality easier to bear. The disadvantage is that it cuts down on life spans. A refrigerator my mother bought 30 years ago broke down only last year, while its successor, of the brand new, carefully labelled, shiny variety, hiccups barely eight months after we got it. The same can be said of cameras: they used to be so heavy and yet so strong, like the Nokias and the old phones we still have with us, and they lasted longer too. They were harder to bear, but easier to part with, because by the time they were done, we were done with them and could gracefully bid farewell to them. That?s something most digital photographers will not experience, because at most, and with careful use, the new equipment can?t last for more than seven or eight years. Technology has liberated us in one respect, but killed us off in?many others.??
That?s something most digital photographers will not experience, because at most, and with careful use, the new equipment can?t last for more than seven or eight years
Most youngsters I know, who get a camera for their birthday or on account of getting good marks or simply due to the fact that their fathers and mothers and grandparents were photographers, click away at the most mundane things: flowers in their garden, cobwebs in their rooms, the dust-laden surfaces of their bookshelves, or even some incongruous item, like a camera lens, on their hands. The learning curve they have to experience steps in after a few months or so, when they learn that pictures of pretty flowers tell as much about the world as the shallow profundity of an art house movie; you think those flowers convey so much when you first take them, but after you develop it or download it on your computer and laptop, you and more pertinently your friends and audiences realise that there?s nothing extraordinary or compelling about your pictures.??
Like advertising, photography thrives on the new and the unfamiliar, on ideas that have never been explored properly before. In the early days, for instance, you had separate film reels for separate ISO counts ? from 200 to more than 6400 ? but today everything?s packed into a little device, so before you get to the new and the unfamiliar you have to get used to the many features and options that your device has. In other words, back then the norm was for you to try out your camera, with its limited features, on backdrops and environments that worked best with the features and settings you had. A reel with an ISO count of 200 worked best at daytime, for instance, while a reel with an ISO count of over 1000 worked best in the evening right until dawn. Even then you had to factor in a ton of other exogenous factors, including the lighting, the kind of face your intended subject had, and the event you had to photograph. The environment controlled you, in other words, and the camera supplemented the fact that it controlled you.??
Modern cameras?
The advantage with modern cameras, of course, is that they?re quite flexible, which means that the photographers become as flexible as the devices they hold and carry. Cartier-Bresson hated colour, and he was eccentric in many other ways when it came to his field, including his obsession over the Leica, the camera he had and used all his life (owing to its discreet nature: unobtrusive, it could be handled in almost every setting imaginable, and it passed by unnoticed), as well as his aversion to taking pictures on commissions (barring certain exceptional circumstances). In Cartier-Bresson?s work, particularly his early work, when he was still taken up with painting, there is a subtle admixture of the picturesque and the real, sometimes the surreal, and this came out despite, or I may say, because of those eccentricities and individual quirks. Digital photography has, thankfully at one level, perhaps not so at another, done away with the need for quirks like this; in the hands of amateurs, the present day Nikons and Canons transform their users into event, landscape, and profile photographers at will.??
In the good old days, there were quite obviously fewer photographers; now everyone with the necessary funds can buy the equipment and, over a certain period of time, master that equipment well. When that happens, even in other art forms, individuality gets lost and the vast majority of the artists (as they like to call themselves) turn towards the more profitable and popular avenues. In photography, these avenues include the birthday and the wedding, and in Sri Lanka, that birthday and that wedding have been supplemented by ad hoc companies and organisations which channel and sustain their popularity and profitability, through social media: Facebook is chock-a-block with such companies, some of which have been started by those still at school.??
This is where the individual artist triumphs. Tired and disillusioned at the way photography has been monopolised by the event and corporate photographer, the true artist rises above all of that and carves out a different path. If it?s difficult to come up with a contemporary Weegee or Walker Evans or Bresson or Stanley Kubrick, it?s because the few who worked in magazines and other commissions and became auteurs and artists did not face the kind of competition they would today. And yet, in Sri Lanka, since so many take to commercial streams in the field, there is still hope left for another Weegee or Walker Evans to come up. The adults, of course, will find their way in this respect, but I am more concerned and interested in the young, since the young tend from their school-going days to take to the kinds of photography that help them earn more money.??
Like advertising, photography thrives on the new and the unfamiliar, on ideas that have never been explored properly before
This latter tragedy ? one of the inevitabilities of modernity, with its emphasis on specialisation and taking to what ensures stability ? is best avoided by becoming more flexible, and to become more flexible, particularly if you don?t come from a family of photographers, is by testing your own talent at it, either by joining a photographic society (which in Sri Lanka is limited to your school or university), or by applying for a competition, or by doing both. I am unfortunately not aware of the competitions that are held annually, by schools and universities on the one hand and institutions and even photography firms on the other, in this country, but I am aware of one competition, and its organisers do a good job of bringing together workshops, quizzes aiming at the technicalities of photography, and an exhibition that recognises talent over technology. This is Pilibimbu, organised by the Photographic Art Society of Ananda College (established in 1946), which while not the oldest such in the country (other schools, like Royal, boast of Societies which predate it by a decade) is perhaps the only Society of its kind that actively promotes the art, and not merely the mechanics, of photography, here.??
My point is this; if one is to discuss the art of photography, one has to start with our schools, and not just Ananda and Pilibimbu, if at all because that is where our photographers, especially those whose families don?t dabble in the field, come from. Much of what?s right, and wrong, with those who take to the subject can be traced to how these schools sustain their societies along with the members of those societies and their interest. Obviously, this calls for a series of sketches. Those sketches, I will present to you here. For now however, I am done.??

The SLFP is all but yelling ?Mayday! Mayday!?
	
?Mayday? is a signal. The term indicates a life-threatening emergency usually used by aviators and mariners, but also in some countries by firefighters and other working in difficult conditions. Apparently it was coined by a senior radio officer at Croydon Airport, London in 1923. He had been asked to come up with a ?distress-indicating word? and had drawn it from the French word m?aider which means ?help me?.? ?
?It is unrelated to the holiday May Day,? Wikipedia notes. May Day predates Mayday, and conspiracy theorists may very well say that it was a pernicious twist. May Day has rarely distressed anyone, especially the capitalist class. Indeed, one might even say that the capitalist class has appropriated May Day through political parties that by and large take care of their interests.? ?
This year won?t be different in this sense, and yet for at least a couple of reasons May Day 2018 will be quite unlike May Days of the past.? ?
?May Day not being on the 1st of May feels strange,? many have said. ?May Day? however is International Workers? Day, where workers all over the world, in and out of unions, in and out of political parties, talk about the distance traveled and the distance to be travelled, so to speak.? ?
What?s important is that it is a single day that?s set aside to celebrate labour and workers, talk about conditions of work exploitation, articulate grievances and discuss what needs to be done. Well, in Sri Lanka, that?s not what happens in the main, but let?s put that aside. It?s a single day. It?s as if ?labour? counts only on a single day, which of course is all rubbish. So, one could argue, if it?s just a single day and if it is close to meaningless, it shouldn?t matter when May Day is held, in May or in another month, or whether it is held on the 1st of January, the 31st of December or the 28th of February.? ?
Those who are religious about May Day have objected, and that says a lot about the status of the working class movement and the Left in this country. In short, they are religious about May Day, i.e. the trappings, and are clueless about the conditions of exploitation.? ?
May Day 2018 is strange for another reason and one which makes us think of ?Mayday! Mayday?. Let us say it in the form of a question: will the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) hold a May Day rally this year?? ?
In 2017, the Yahapalana Government, which seemed less watery in terms of cohesion than it is now, threw a challenge to the Joint Opposition (JO): ?we will let you have the biggest open space in Colombo, Galle Face ? try filling it!? The JO was essentially a breakaway faction of the SLFP. The ?mother party? decided to do its thing in Kandy. The JO took up the challenge and drew unprecedented crowds to the Galle Face. It was an even bigger show than their rally a year before in Kirulapona.? ?
This year won?t be different in this sense, and yet for at least a couple of reasons May Day 2018 will be quite unlike May Days of the past.
If that was an indication of slippage in the SLFP?s and especially President Mairhtipala Sirisena?s political fortunes, the true dimensions were realized on February 10, 2018. Sirisena?s share of the party, so to say, diminished to the point that his faction, the official SLFP, could hardly muster 15% of the total vote at the local government elections. Further erosion was evidenced when 16 SLFPers who officially sided with Sirisena supported the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on April 5, 2018. Today, they are threatening to organize a separate May Day rally if the party leadership does not move to replace certain office-bearers. Whether they can do it is not relevant here. What?s pertinent is that as we write, just two weeks before the official May Day (May 7), the SLFP does not seem to be in any position to do the show-of-force number that May Day has traditionally been.? ?
Apparently a committee has been appointed to organize the event, this time in Batticaloa. From Hyde Park to Kandy to Batticaloa might sound like a retreat to some. The JO is to have it?s May Day rally in Galle this year. ?Retreat? cannot be applied to this ?distancing? from Colombo simply because the JO is in consolidation mode. Their numbers increased in Parliament and they are well ahead outside. In all likelihood, they will put up the best show this ?May Day?.? ?
Some UNPers are cock-a-hoop over their leader surviving the no-confidence motion, but they?ve failed to understand that this ?victory? came from a parliamentary composition that inflates considerably the voter-sentiment as evidenced on February 10. They?ve moved from Campbell Park to Sugathadasa Stadium.? ?
More importantly, the entire exercise has driven the key coalition partner, the SLFP and its leader Sirisena, into a serious identity crisis. They are not sure if they are part of the government or not, whether they should or should not be in the government.? ?
Sirisena, whose tenure has been marked by tremendous efforts to be accepted as the leader of the SLFP (not just in name), doesn?t have a party to speak of. It?s as though the SLFP has upped and left its official residence on Darley Road. The party office remains, but the building is all but empty. We will know for sure when the show is over. There will be some chest-beating and bravado. No one will actually blurt out ?Mayday! Mayday! and not just on account of language preferences, but the distress signs are so unmistakable that cries for help are not necessary.? ?

## Title: There?s no respect for  foreign women in Sri Lanka

There?s no respect for  foreign women in Sri Lanka
	
A conversation with hotelier Paloma Scott??
Mirissa made headlines for an unpleasant incident earlier this month and the authorities immediately reacted to it by taking actions like suspending the activities of the restaurant and removing unauthorised establishments along the Mirissa coastal belt. Hence, work is in progress to safeguard the tourism industry in the country, with special focus on the South. Having been in the tourism industry for six years, Unawatuna Beach Resorts (Pvt) Ltd Managing Director Paloma Scott recently expressed her concerns about the attitudes men have towards white women. She was born in England (London) to Sri Lankan and Scottish/English parents. When her brother discovered Unawatuna, Paloma was determined to change her career plans and get involved in the tourism industry instead. In a candid interview with the Daily Mirror, Paloma expressed her views about how the beach culture has changed over the years, the disgusting attitudes of Sri Lankan men towards foreign women and offered a few tips to foreigners who travel to Sri Lanka in future. Excerpts :
The moment people see a white face in their shops their prices start skyrocketing
	Young children should be taught how women should be respected since this problem should be addressed from the grassroots level.
	English is the language of the law in this country and it is a sign of education
	The idea of service in Sri Lanka has gotten mixed up with the idea of servitude
	I guess Thailand does a better job in keeping people safe
	Three-wheel drivers ask the most intimate questions the moment I step into a three-wheeler
	Therefore the availability of technology and porn videos in particular, changes people?s attitudes?
?Q? From when you first discovered Unawatuna what changes have you seen in the beach culture?
Unawatuna is a very particular case because when you go to the hotel the curve of the beach was a bit like Mirissa. In 2012 we lost the beach when the coastal conservation department, with the guidance of the Rajapaksa Government, decided in their wisdom to build a breakwater. It was ideally to protect the corals destroyed by the tsunami. None of the villagers knew about it and when it started in June or July in 2012 the beach started to disappear.?
I still have friends in London who would text me and ask whether I?m safe in Sri Lanka. I don?t think that the people around the world look at Sri Lanka in a positive way. Every time there is a bad news in Sri Lanka it spreads so fast and gets the attention of international media in a matter of seconds
They built the breakwater very quickly, but their calculation proved to be slightly wrong because the water came in with great speed and took all our sand towards the Western side of the reef. Nobody speaks about such incidents, but I decided to voice out my concerns because nobody can take away anybody?s beach and it affected the industry. I started getting help and eventually the Rajapaksa regime immediately attended to the matter. They pumped the sand in and within two weeks we had the biggest beach in down South. So Unawatuna went from being an intimate coast to an enormous beach and it attracted a different group of tourists. I market my hotel as a family oriented hotel and 50% of guests are Sri Lankans and the rest are from all over the world. I hear of various incidents around the coastal belt in the South, but so far I haven?t heard of such incidents happening in Unawatuna.?
?
?Q? How have ?beach boys? become a menace in the area?
I personally haven?t had any serious incidents with beach boys, but there have been incidents with various drug dealers. There are one or two wandering around, but they keep clear when I?m around. There are guests who attract them as well. There are no incidents of beach boys harassing women in Unawatuna, but I see that Mirissa has a big problem.?
Mirissa has many night clubs along the shore, but Unawatuna mainly has restaurants and bars except for one or two night clubs with loud music even after 11.30pm. But if I have a party at my hotel I have to finish it off by 11.30pm and its sad how one rule works for me and there is another rule for the rest. I feel that if I was a man this wouldn?t have been so. But because I am a woman it doesn?t really matter and that is one example of bullying.?
?
?Q? In your recent write up on socail media you have mentioned about authorities lagging behind in their duties. What are your observations on how they respond to incidents involving violence and harassment?
I think part of it is to do with liquor and cigarettes because men speak that language. They trade in that and the authorities turn a blind eye to these incidents. But when there?s a woman involved they can?t do that and I definitely will not give them liquor or cigarettes. Most of these officers are not well educated and they don?t speak English.?
English is the language of the law in this country and it is a sign of education. They hide behind their inability to speak English and use it as a tool to bully and harass people like me. What I find is that they do understand English although they can?t speak and it?s a useful mechanism for them to hide behind it and act as if they knew nothing. Most of the forms we get to fill are in English or Sinhala, but not Tamil.?
?The Tamil diaspora is very powerful and the world outside already views Sri Lanka as an unsafe destination to travel to. The Sinhalese community has failed to counter argue about the war and in Britain, Canada and Norway there is a bias towards a minority interest
But they have to be written in Tamil as well since this is a trilingual country. In Britain documents are available in over 10 different languages although it is a monolingual country. The third reason is the male chauvinist attitudes towards a white woman. They have this incredible habit of being rude in front of me and most of them can?t even look at me and shake my hand. That has nothing to do with language and they are basic manners which are lacking in most people. This is why I have mentioned in my article that a white woman is viewed as a peculiar aberration and they don?t have any respect towards foreign women. This is my experience.?
?
?Q? Does this also go in line with the belief that men have a tendency to harass women because they watch a lot of pornography?
Quite interestingly I too have had a theory as to why Sri Lankan men, particularly three-wheel drivers ask the most intimate questions the moment I step into a three-wheeler. They ask if I would like to come back to their house and similar questions. I?m old enough to be their grandmother and they just think that because you are in a foreign land and since you are alone, you are ?up for grabs?. I would never even dream of asking them or their wives these questions. So yes, because they look at all these videos and because there is a liking for white flesh and because they see a lot of white women in porn videos they believe that we do it all the time. Therefore the availability of technology and porn videos in particular, changes people?s attitudes towards white women.?
?
?Q? The Sri Lankan tourism industry is still in its developing stages. Don?t you think that incidents such as what happened in Mirissa will put a black mark against the country?
I think the Government, big hotel owners and operators should lead this mission. As I understand that many tourism-related businesses are owned by ministers or they have their hand in it. The best thing they could do is promote Sri Lanka as a safe destination for tourists to travel to and take action against the culture of objectifying women. Since Sri Lanka is a Buddhist country and people are heavily inspired by the Buddhist culture, young children should be taught how women should be respected since this problem should be addressed from the grassroots level.?
Another observation is that the moment people see a white face in their shops their prices start skyrocketing. A Sri Lankan coming to Britain would pay the same price as the person next to him, but this is not the case in Sri Lanka
The Tamil diaspora is very powerful and the world outside already views Sri Lanka as an unsafe destination to travel to. The Sinhalese community has failed to counter argue about the war and in Britain, Canada and Norway there is a bias towards a minority interest. I still have friends in London who would text me and ask whether I?m safe in Sri Lanka. I don?t think that the people around the world look at Sri Lanka in a positive way. Every time there is a bad news in Sri Lanka it spreads so fast and gets the attention of international media in a matter of seconds.?
?Q? Countries such as Thailand for instance also have a beach culture, but tourists are safe there. What makes this difference?
I think there may be incidents in Thailand and because it is a large country they have a very sophisticated tourist industry. I see that they have a culture of service. The idea of service in Sri Lanka has gotten mixed up with the idea of servitude. No one wants to be a servant or be in servitude. I think another problem for politicians and the tourist industry is how to inculcate the idea of service and how do you inculcate the fact that tourists should be treated in the same hospitable manner as how you would treat a guest who visits your house. I?m sure you would immediately ask ?have you eaten?? This should be the benchmark for the tourist industry. In that case people would spend money and come here rather than going to Thailand. I guess Thailand does a better job in keeping people safe, it may be that they are clever at covering any problems they have.?
?
?Q? What tips could you offer foreigners who travel to Sri Lanka?
I would say that they should dress appropriately. It is not about covering themselves from head to toe, but a lot of them should dress properly. This is because most white women are viewed differently to Sri Lankan women and white women tend to emphasize all the wrong bits in their body. If you are wearing something that?s revealing your body parts, it would draw the attention of people around you irrespective of whether you are walking down a street in London or in Sri Lanka. Other than that it does help to know a little bit of the language and it does help that you shouldn?t haggle on the smallest amount of money. I see this mostly in foreigners and a little Rs. 100 is nothing.? Another observation is that the moment people see a white face in their shops their prices start skyrocketing. A Sri Lankan coming to Britain would pay the same price as the person next to him, but this is not the case in Sri Lanka. Also just like anywhere don?t go out at night and don?t get involved in drugs or booze until you don?t know where you are.?
I started getting help and eventually the Rajapaksa regime immediately attended to the matter. They pumped the sand in and within two weeks we had the biggest beach in down South. So Unawatuna went from being an intimate coast to an enormous beach
?
?Q? As a hotelier do you see a bright future for the tourism industry?
Not at the moment. I say this simply because there are many opportunities to not repeat the same mistakes as in other parts of the world. I think this should start from kindergarten. Children should be taught not to throw rubbish and pollute the environment. We are heading towards a crisis because there are many plastic bottles that get washed onto the shore. The authorities have turned a blind eye on these issues once again. Sri Lanka is a fabulous country and we don?t have to do much. We are far ahead than India because you don?t fall ill. The ?male collective? should change their attitudes towards women and women should be encouraged to enter the workforce as well. We have all the natural resources in abundance and we need to protect them before the country turns into a desert.?

Trump, Macron mull new Iran nuclear deal
	
?
French President Macron said Tuesday he wants to work on a new deal with Iran that brings representatives from the countries in the region to the negotiating table.?
?
Macron, who is on a three-day state visit to the United States, said he did not favour tearing up the existing deal, but rather ?building something new that will cover all of our concerns.?? ?
He said his talks with US President Donald Trump led him to believe that there is an opportunity to take a new course on the Iran deal, which Trump has long insisted should be revised.? ?
?I believe that the discussions we?ve had together make it possible to open the way, to pave the way for a new agreement,? Macron said, adding that he would like to see the involvement of ?regional powers? along with Russia and Turkey.? ?
The current deal can be seen one ?pillar? to which three others should be added, Macron said, speaking at a joint news conference with Trump.? ?
The others would tackle Iran?s long-term nuclear ambitions beyond the current scope of the deal; Iran?s ballistic missile programme; and political solutions to contain Iran?s activity in Syria, Yemen and Lebanon.? ?
He said a broader deal would address the ?whole of the situation in the region? and would be the only way to ?bring about stability? there. It would also take up Trump?s concerns and criticism of the deal.? ?

## Title: What on Earth is happening?

What on Earth is happening?
	
Sunday April 22 was World Earth Day ? a day of vital importance for the people of Sri Lanka and worldwide because our failure to act as responsible citizens and get involved in the battle against global warming could lead to catastrophic consequences. It is a sacred duty. Thus all religions and all races need to work together though the United States President Donald Trump -- predictably unpredictable and facing charges ranging from being a cad and a conner to collusion with Russia -- is still insisting that global warming is a Chinese hoax. But most world analysts believe that Mr. Trump and his changing polices are turning out to be as grave a danger to the world as climate change.? ?
?
This year?s Earth Day theme and thrust are to encourage people to reduce their plastic consumption and use more eco-friendly materials. It?s the planet we live on and is home to more than six billion humans and millions of animals and plants. But with climate change and pollution endangering Planet Earth, people are being urged to help protect the fragile environment.? ?
?
The Earth Day?s aim is to encourage people to do things that will benefit the Earth. These include recycling more, using solar power or planting trees.? ?
More than a billion people are reported to have celebrated the day. They included environmental campaigners Leonardo DiCaprio and Emma Watson. For 2018, the Earth Day theme is End Plastic Pollution.? ?
?
According to environmental activists, here are some simple steps we could take to reduce plastic consumption: Use reusable bags when we go shopping, where possible do not use plastic straws with drinks, buy boxes instead of bottles ? cardboard is easier to recycle than plastic, use reusable bottles and cups, and pack meals in reusable containers instead of disposable plastic containers and sandwich bags.? ?
?
According to the Cable News Network (CNN), five good and bad things have happened since the last Earth Day.? ?
?
We lost one rhino subspecies -- the world?s last male northern white rhino died last month, leaving the future of the subspecies in doubt.? ?
?
At 45, the rhino Sudan was fraught with age-related issues and multiple infections. He lived in the OI Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya surrounded by armed guards who protected him 24 hours a day.? ?
?
Rhinos are targeted by poachers, who believe that rhino horns cure various ailments. Experts say the rhino horn is becoming more lucrative than drugs.? ?
?
We are saying goodbye to plastics - Plastic-free supermarkets, a deposit on plastic bottles and jail time for using plastic bags. These are just some of the efforts leaders are making to curb the world?s plastic addiction. In February, the first plastic-free supermarket aisle was unveiled in Amsterdam. Shoppers there are buying their groceries in new compostable bio-materials and traditional materials such as glass, metal and cardboard.? ?
?
Plastic straws, drink stirrers and cotton swabs could be banned in Britain as part of the government?s plan to eliminate all avoidable plastic waste by 2042. The British government is also planning to introduce a deposit on plastic bottles, requiring customers to pay an extra tax when buying single-use drink containers that will be refunded once those items are recycled.? ?
?
CNN says it met a punk-rock turtle - The good news is that CNN discovered an Australian river turtle with a distinctive green punk-rock hairstyle, two spikes under its chin and the ability to breathe through its genitals. The bad news is, it may not be around for long because it?s on a new list of endangered reptiles.? ?
?
Leonardo DiCaprio to the rescue - There are only 30 vaquita porpoises left on Earth, and Leonardo DiCaprio wants to save them. The vaquita, which looks similar to a dolphin, calls the Gulf of California home. The species has become endangered due to illegal fishing. The actor and activist used Twitter and Instagram to get his millions of followers to sign a petition asking Mexico?s President to take immediate action to protect the endangered vaquita porpoise. The President was all ears.? ?
?
We hope innovative, enterprising Sri Lankans also will find and promote new ways to protect planet earth and the government needs to encourage them by providing tax concessions and facilities.??

Won?t allow to abolish executive presidency: NFF
	
The National Freedom Front (NFF) today said it would never allow the JVP proposal on abolishing the executive presidency to be approved in Parliament as it would lead to a divided country .
?The government headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has induced the JVP to submit a proposal to abolish the executive presidency so that it can fulfil the agendas of foreign countries. The Prime Minister failed in his attempt to create a federal State because of the lack of support from other political parties. This time, however he is using the JVP as the cat?s paw to fulfil his ambitions,? National Freedom Front (NFF) Organiser Jayantha Samaraweera told a news conference yesterday.
Mr. Samaraweera said the NFF will join other patriotic civil society groups to educate the people on the dangers of this proposal. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
