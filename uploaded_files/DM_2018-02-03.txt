All 955 miners trapped for over a day in South Africa gold mine unharmed
	

All 955 gold miners who were trapped underground for more than a day in South Africa following a power cut resurfaced unharmed on Friday, the mines owner, Sibanye Gold, said.
Everybodys out, said spokesman James Wellsted, adding that there were cases of dehydration and high blood pressure but nothing serious.
The miners were stuck in the Beatrix gold mine, in the small town of Theunissen near the city of Welkom, for around 30 hours after a massive power outage caused by a storm prevented lifts from bringing workers on the night shift to the surface.
After several hours engineers were able to restore power, allowing the hoist to bring up the miners  who had been trapped since Wednesday evening  in batches.
Asked if there had been any casualties, Mr. Wellsted said there was no indication so far that anyone has been in distress although it had been a traumatic experience.
Several ambulances arrived on-site overnight, the AFP reporter said.
Nervous family members had earlier patiently gathered along the road to the shaft, kept at a distance by security guards.

Debate on PCoI report: JO asks Speaker for maximum time
	
The joint opposition (JO) said yesterday it would request Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to allocate maximum time for the JO for the parliamentary debate on the Bond Commissions report.
MP Bandula Gunawardana told a news conference that the JO was the group which spearheaded the campaign which revealed the Central Bank bond scam.
Not only did we reveal the scam, we literally shed blood for this. Our MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena was injured during the protest held near the Central Bank in Colombo when a barrier fell on him. We organised awareness campaigns across the country to make people aware about the scam. Therefore, we deserve the most amount of time at the debate, he said.
The MP said the National Executive Council which was set up during the 100-day programme and its members were also responsible for the bond scam because the council had allowed the appointment of former CB governor Arjuna Madendran.
He said it was the JO which wrote to the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank informing of them about the CB scam. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Lasantha killing: Fmr. Mt. Lavinia crimes OIC remanded
	
Former Mount Lavinia police Crimes OIC Tissa Sugathapala, who is the first suspect in connection with the killing of former Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickramatunge, was produced before Mount Lavinia Magistrate Mohamed Mihail by the CID yesterday.
The suspect was ordered to be remanded till February 16.
The CID arrested the suspect over the alleged attempt to destroy and conceal evidence of the case involving the senior journalist's killing.
During the previous hearing, the CID told the Mount Lavinia Magistrate that investigations into Lasanthas murder had uncovered an alleged attempt by the Mount Lavinia Police and the TID to destroy vital evidence of the killing.
On an earlier occasion, the CID filing a report informed Court that on the day before Lasanthas killing, an officer from the Maradana Tripoli Market Army Intelligence unit had trailed his vehicle.
The CID also informed Court that it had initiated further investigations to identify the mobile number of the intelligence officer who had followed Lasanthas vehicle the day prior to his killing.

Maldives SC orders release of former President Mohamed Nasheed, eight others
	

THE HINDU, 02nd FEBRUARY, 2018-In a surprise ruling Thursday evening, the Supreme Court of the Maldives ordered the immediate release of exiled former leader Mohamed Nasheed and eight others, terming their trials a violation of the constitution and international law.
The apex court has ordered new trials, citing the questionable and politically motivated nature of the trials of the political leaders, according to a news report of the AFP.
The government has said the administration is currently working to vet and clarify the ruling, and sources in Male indicate that the order is yet to be implemented.
While the ruling makes significant implications on various points of constitutional import and criminal justice procedures, it was issued without representation of the State from either the Attorney General or the Prosecutor General, international spokesperson at the Presidents office Ibrahim Hussain Shihab said in a statement.
Tweeting on the development, former President Nasheed said late Thursday: Welcome tonights SC ruling calling for the immediate release of political prisoners and the restoration of their civil and political rights. President Yameen must abide by this ruling and resign. Urge all citizens to avoid confrontation and engage in peaceful political activity.
Even as the Male administration has said it will work to engage, and consult with, the Supreme Court in order to comply with the ruling, the police have reportedly clashed with dissidents on the streets of the capital early Friday, as they demanded the release of politicians whose convictions were overturned. The police pepper-sprayed many of us there.

## Title: Robin Hood of Mawanella

Robin Hood of Mawanella
	
Our forefathers fought to gain independence from the British colonial rule. That was for the sake of all the Sri Lankans irrespective of all differences, social, political, economic, age, sex, colour and such others. Those who are rich and influential often do not like to share the benefits of independence with the unprivileged group.
This means that many citizens of this country have been deprived of the benefits of economic independence.
However, there were heroes in our country who strived to extend the benefits of independence to the unprivileged group. They forced the rich to release part of their riches to the poor. Utuwankande Soora Saradiel is was one such hero, who robbed the money from the rich, especially the colonial rulers and their henchmen and made them available to the unprivileged.

Robin Hood of Ceylon
Saradiel was a Ceylonese gang leader, who became legend in Sri Lanka known as the Robin Hood of Sri Lanka.
Some scholars place him in the context of insurgencies against the British colonial rule rather than a manifestation of local lawlessness or economic justice.
He was believed to have possessed the power of hiding without getting caught and attacking the rich people especially the British colonial rulers and their local henchmen, including Police officers, who attempted to arrest him.
Rulers and the Police believed that he could not be shot at because he was believed to be bulletproof.It was believed that he had had a mantra which gave him such powers. He took to thievery and although he was branded as an outlaw, he distributed the robbed items amongst the poor villagers irrespective of whether the receivers were his followers, relatives or friends.

Utuwankande
Utuwankande is a beautiful rocky mountain peak situated strategically between Kegalle and Mawanella facing the Colombo - Kandy main road.
It is a beautiful rock peak from where he could observe anything happening in the vicinity and anyone passing
the place. It is a strategic point from where he could operate and distribute his loots among poor villagers.

His father, Adis Appu who did not approve Saradiels criminal acts was not prepared to come to
his rescue. In spite of his fathers reluctance to help Saradiel could have evaded the Police if he lived in Chilaw but he came back to Utuwankande, where he had his gang.

There are also hiding places in the peak and elsewhere in the vicinity to keep away from his enemies. There were relatives and friends to provide information about any impending danger. On the top of the peak, there is a cave which Saradiel used as his hiding place and stayed secretly without the risk of being getting caught.
This rock boulder is covered with a cluster of trees. There is a tunnel dug by Saradiel to escape. About 15 to 20 metres ahead of the main tunnel branches off to three tunnels. One branch tunnel leads to Bo-Ella about two Kilometres away.
Presumably, the other branch tunnels lead to two other safe places which are not traceable today.

Family
Saradiel was the eldest son of Adis Appu, a tobacco merchant, a carter hailing from a family at Haldanduwa in the Chilaw district.
His mother was one Pitchohamy from Utuwankande. Pitchohamy owned a roadside coffee boutique. Before reaching Pahala Kadugannawa hills almost all the carters stopped at this coffee boutique because they and their buffaloes need a rest.
An intimacy had been built between Pitchohamy and carter Adis Appu during the course of the latters visits to Utuwankande. Later they got married and their eldest son was Saradiel.
Saradiel was born more than one and a half centuries ago, on March 25, 1832. The full name of Saradiel is Deekirikewage Saradiel but he is widely known as Utuwankande Soora Saradiel.
During this short period of life, he had done much for the sake of the poor man and has earned good fame to be remembered as a hero on this Independence Day.
Saradiels earliest schooling to read and write was at Etulgoda Vihare. He continued his studies at the Beligammana Temple and
Ilukwatte Temple.
He had to leave school when he assaulted a boy from a rich family. By nature, he was mischievous, stubborn and he wanted to do things on his own.

at Army barracks
After leaving school, Saradiel came to Colombo and was employed as a domestic servant of an army officer in the army barracks. He often quarrelled with his master and at last, he stole some silver spoons belonging to his master. He was apprehended for the offence and was severely warned not to repeat.
He was a barrack boy in the Ceylon Rifle Regiment in Slave Island where he learnt to use guns and other weapons from Malay Soldiers. However, one day he got caught in the midst of a theft and he was dismissed.

Life of crime
He returned to Utuwankande and started a life of crime with his accomplices; Mammal Marikkar, Muhammad Suwath, Nasardeen, Sirimala, Ukkinda and Modara Tanne Handa and got involved in crime
and robbery. Since Police were all out to arrest him Saradiel fled to Chilaw to find shelter under his father, whose permanent residence was there.
However, his father, Adis Appu who did not approve of Saradiels criminal acts was not prepared to come to his rescue. In spite of his fathers reluctance to help Saradiel could have evaded the Police if he lived in Chilaw but he came back to Utuwankande, where he had his gang.
However, while he was living at Utuwankande he was arrested at Pillawatte by Modara Police on a tip-off from an informant.
However, before he was caught Saradiel had fatally stabbed a Police Constable who attempted to arrest him.
In July 1862 he was produced before Justice of the Peace, Negombo and was sent to fiscal custody in Colombo.
He was detained in jail for trial in the Supreme Court for robbery, assault and stabbing.
However, in November in the same year Sardiel, had jumped from the prison roof and had escaped. His friend, Martin Singho, who was in the same prison presumably had helped him to escape.
Martin Singho was sentenced to six months rigorous imprisonment. Saradiel meanwhile came back to Utuwankande but was arrested again by the village Constable Baba Saraon on this occasion.
While he was being taken to Colombo he again escaped from the Police officer and several fiscal peons, who were on guard in spite of the fact that he was pinioned and handcuffed whiled the party had been given strict instructions not to un-pinion him, even to take meals and to spend the nights only in
police stations. Saradiel had escaped with his handcuffs on. It was disclosed that Saradiels fathers brother had joined the party and presumably he had planned for Saradiels escape. A reward of five pounds was offered to anyone who could arrest Saradiel. This notice was published in the Government Gazette Extraordinary on January
10, 1863.

At Aranayake
Later Saradiel shifted his operations to Aranayake where villagers witnessed a widespread crime.
Later the offered reward to arrest Saradiel was increased to 100 Pounds and for each individual in his gang to 20 pounds.

Arrest and execution
At last Saradiel had taken shelter in a house at Mawanella. Mammalay Marikkar was with him. A Police team had gone there to arrest Saradiel. Saradiel who was shot at by Sergeant Alawatte was wounded. Immediately Mammalay Marikkar shot at Constable Shahan and
killed him.
There was only one door in that house and Sergeant Alawatte stood guard on the door. Assistant Government Agent F.R. Saunders soon arrived with a detachment and Saradiel surrendered with his companion Mammalay Marikkar.
They were taken to Kandy and were produced before Justice Thompson and were sentenced to death. Thus, this hero, friend of the poor ended his life on May 7, 1864, at the age of 32 years.

Russia fetes 75th anniversary of battle for Stalingrad
	

DPA, 02nd FEBRUARY, 2018-The southern Russian city once known as Stalingrad is celebrating 75 years since one of the bloodiest battles of World War II that ended with a pivotal Soviet victory.
Russian President Vladimir Putin is due to attend the events in the city, now known as Volgograd.
A parade featuring 75 tanks, one for each year since the victory, as well as 1,500 military personnel and 50 aircraft, is set to take place in the city centre.
The city, on the Volga River, was renamed in the early 1960s during the political thaw that followed the death of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.
In the winter of 1942-43, Nazi German troops had for months occupied most of Stalingrad when more than 300,000 of them were encircled by the Red Army.
The Soviet victory came arduously, with an estimated death toll of 700,000, and is considered a turning point in the war.

Seventy Years of Independence and Tamils of Sri Lanka
	
Given the raucous cacophony of strident cries of race and religion, it does seem unlikely that this polyphony of voices can ever be blended into a harmonious symphony.

A significant section of the Tamils was in the vanguard of a freedom struggle against the British.
The nearest to an anti-British, pro-freedom struggle, in the country came from the north
The south...was generally quiet during British rule
The dominant Sinhala political class preferred to cooperate with rather than confront the British


By D.B.S. Jeyaraj
Three score and ten years have passed since Sri Lanka, then known as Ceylon, gained Independence from Britain on February 4, 1948. The Island nation had been under colonial bondage for a very long period. The Portuguese rule came first in 1505, followed by Dutch rule in 1658. Finally came the British rule in 1796 that lasted until 1948.
It was the British who unified the Island under a single administration in 1833. They also introduced universal franchise and electoral representation through the State Council in 1931.
Sri Lanka will celebrate her seventieth anniversary of Independence tomorrow February 4th, 2018. Completing 70 years of freedom is indeed a significant milepost. Independent Sri Lanka, or Ceylon, has faced many challenges and problems in the past 70 years. We have had military coup attempts, communal riots, pogroms, armed revolts, external military intervention, assassinations of Heads of State, terrorist violence and above all a long secessionist war that threatened to tear apart the country.
What Sri Lanka can be proud of as Asias oldest democracy is the fact that despite many formidable challenges and crises the country continues to be democratic. Flawed but Democratic! More importantly, perhaps Independent Ceylon/Sri Lanka has succeeded tremendously in improving the quality of life for her people in areas such as education, higher education, healthcare, nutrition, infant mortality, life expectancy, family planning, rural electrification, roads, transport facilities, housing and worker rights.
An illustrative example of the progress made would be life expectancy. When Independence dawned life expectancy for a male was 46 years and 44 for a female in Sri Lanka. After 70 years of Independence, it has risen to 72 years for a male and 78 years for a female.
While Sri Lankas post-independence record is certainly impressive, what is saddening -and somewhat maddening - is the realisation that we could have achieved much, much more but for political mismanagement. Had our post-independence governments ruled wisely, Sri Lanka could have been an economic power in Asia. Our political class -selfish and short-sighted - has through various acts of omission and commission reduced the country to a sorry state. Looking at the prevailing political situation of today, it appears that no effective lessons have been learnt even after seven decades of independence.

An example of the progress would be life expectancy. When Independence dawned life expectancy for a male was 46 years and 44 for a female. After 70 years, it has risen to 72 and 78 years for a female.



As stated earlier Sri Lanka has certainly progressed in many directions. However, it has failed in the key area of nation-building. Ethnic relations between the Sinhala and Tamil people deteriorated due to a series of blunders by politicians on either side of the ethnic divide resulting in what was termed as South Asias longest war.
The separatist war waged by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) is now over and the country has been unified militarily but whether the country has been united politically remains an unanswered question.
Notwithstanding optimistic assertions by those in power the stark reality today is that of the Sri Lankan Tamil people being alienated from the State and estranged from mainstream consciousness.

Archipelago of Communities
Paradoxical as it may seem, I have in the past often referred to Sri Lanka as both an Island nation and archipelago of communities. Given the raucous cacophony of strident cries of race and religion, it does seem unlikely that this polyphony of voices can ever be blended into a harmonious symphony.
It is against this backdrop that this column intends to focus reflectively on the recent past of post-independence Sri Lanka and ponder over its future while drawing extensively from earlier writings of a similar nature.
For anyone being free of colonial bondage, Independence Day would be a day of joy and happiness. But that has not been so for the Tamils of Sri Lanka for many, many years. They remain estranged and alienated from the Sri Lankan state still. Many Tamils are not part of the freedom day festivity emotionally and spiritually.
To many Tamil people whether in Sri Lanka or abroad the future for Tamils in Sri Lanka seems bleak and dreary. This despondency is not one which envelopes sympathisers and supporters of the LTTE alone. It is prevalent more widely, regardless of political affiliation.
There was a time when Independence Day on February 4th was observed as a day of mourning by many Tamils. The advent of the Ilankai Thamil Arasuk Katchi (ITAK/Federal Party) and the rise of Tamil nationalism in the fifties and sixties of the last century, saw the Tamil polity being asked to treat Freedom Day as a day of mourning. The rationale was that independence from British had only resulted in bondage under Sinhalese. There was only a change of masters. So, Independence Day was nothing to celebrate, but only to be observed as a black day, it was argued.
These symbolic protests underwent a change after the Republican Constitution of 1972. Thereafter, May 22nd too was observed as a black day. February 4th lost a little of its significance. The symbolism of black flags on Independence Day however continued. The escalation of the conflict and resultant suffering made the very concept of independence meaningless to Tamils. Years of perceived oppression and suppression had inculcated among Sri Lankan Tamils a feeling of alienation in the land of their forefathers.

The dominant Sinhala political class preferred to cooperate rather than confront the British. They worked for self -rule through negotiation rather than agitation. As a result of this nation never had an anti-colonial struggle as what was conducted in India by Mahatma Gandhi or Netaji Subash Chandra Bose.


Tamil Political Psyche
The Tamil political psyche too had changed over the decades. Tamils saw themselves as being on par with the Sinhalese as a founding race of this nation during the Ramanathan-Arunachalam era; the G. G. Ponnambalam period saw Tamils thinking of themselves as the premier all island minority; S. J. V. Chelvanayagam years saw the Tamils regarding themselves as a territorial minority of the north-east; the Amirthalingam years and the emergence of the TULF saw Tamils perceiving themselves as a distinct nationality with a separate homeland and the right of self-determination. Veluppillai Prabhakaran and other Tamil militant organisation leaders led an armed struggle to liberate this homeland on the basis of the mandate for Tamil Eelam obtained by the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) at the July 1977 elections.
Tamil perception of sovereignty too differed. The Jaffna Kingdom had lost its sovereignty on the battlefield to the Portuguese in 1619. It was then ceded to the Dutch in 1658; the British took over from the Dutch in 1796. It was only in 1833 after the Colebrooke Reforms of 1832 that pre-dominantly Tamil territories were integrated into a unified Ceylon. Until then they were administered separately.
In 1948, the British transferred power to the Sinhala majority. It was the Tamil position that the 1947 Dominion Constitution that paved the way for Independence in 1948, the 1972 and 1978 Constitutions were imposed on Tamils without the consent of the majority of their elected representatives. Tamil sovereignty, therefore, lies within the Tamil nation still and the Sinhala majority has no right to dominate. This position often stated on political platforms was argued brilliantly by Murugeysen Tiruchelvam in courts at the Amirthalingam trial-at-bar case of 1976.
However, Post-independence political problems should not blind us to the fact that a significant section of the Tamils was in the vanguard of a freedom struggle against the British.
Sadly the pioneering role played by Tamils in the quest for Independence is now forgotten. From Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalams famous lecture on Our Political Needs which laid the foundation for the National Congress to the activities of the Jaffna Youth Congress, Tamil efforts have been commendable in this regard.
The south after the heroic and historic 1818 and 1848 rebellions was generally quiet during British rule. The dominant Sinhala political class preferred to cooperate with rather than confront the British. They worked for self -rule through negotiation rather than agitation. As a result of this nation never had an anti-colonial struggle as what was conducted in India by Mahatma Gandhi or Netaji Subash Chandra Bose.

Jaffna Youth Congress
The nearest to an anti-British, pro-freedom struggle, in the country came from the north. It emanated from the now forgotten Jaffna Youth Congress led by the likes of Handy Perinbanayagam, Orator Subramaniam, C. Ponnambalam. Fired by the ideals espoused by Mahatma Gandhi the Youth Congress demanded Poorana Swaraj (Complete Independence) and urged a boycott of the first State Council elections in support. It was the Jaffna Youth Congress which called first for Poorana Swaraj or complete self-rule from the British and rejected the limited reforms proposed by the Donoughmore Commission.
It is recorded that hundreds of Jaffna youths ran about the town streets shouting Swaraj after listening to a lecture by Kamaladevi Chattopadhyaya. The 1931 boycott was observed only in Jaffna.
The rest of the country did not follow suit and the boycott ultimately ended in failure. British scholar Jane Russell compared the Jaffna boycott to parallel developments during the Indian freedom struggle and observed that it was like the turkey-cock trying to imitate the dance of the peacock.
Later, southern historians tried to distort the boycott call and depicted it as a communal cry. That, however, was untrue. The Youth Congress boycott was inspired by nobler motives. So praiseworthy was the impact of the Youth Congress, that Philip Gunewardena, the Father of Marxism in Sri Lanka, wrote glowingly in the Searchlight journal that Jaffna had given the lead and asked the Sinhalese to follow suit. Prof. Wiswa Warnapala reviewing the book written by Santhaseelan Kadirgamar on the Jaffna Youth Congress expressed his admirataion of the Jaffna Youth Congress openly and chastised Sinhala political leaders of the colonial period as Bootlickers of Imperialism.
The Youth Congress also conducted several meetings and satyagraha, in support of freedom. Two noteworthy feats were the boycott of a visit to Jaffna by then Prince of Wales and the hoisting of the Nandhi (Crouched Bull) flag in place of the Union Jack.
It was in Jaffna that the erstwhile Jaffna Kingdoms Nandhi flag was hoisted defiantly instead of the Union Jack on the Empire Day. It was Jaffna that boycotted the visit of the then Prince of Wales during colonial rule.
Tragically, political vicissitudes in the post-independence years compelled Tamils to demonstrate with black flags on Independence Day.
The roots of this development and the emotive background to it are understandable. It is to be hoped that a satisfactory resolution of the Tamil national question would bring about a remarkable change in Tamil attitudes towards Independence from the British in the future.

National Anthem In Tamil
The singing of the national anthem in Tamil at the official Independence Day Celebration was made possible by the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe Government. After several decades Namo, Namo Thaayae was sung at an official Independence Day Celebration.
It was a highly commendable move and welcomed by most Tamils. Yet it was only a silver lining in a dark cloud. What is important to note is that unequal relations between the numerical majority community and other numerical minority communities still exist.

The nearest to an anti-British, pro-freedom struggle, in the country came from the north. It emanated from the now forgotten Jaffna Youth Congress led by the likes of Handy Perinbanayagam, Orator Subramaniam ...

This is particularly so in the case of the Sri Lankan Tamils who have been struggling to achieve equality on the Island for decades. The Tamil Eelam demand was a desperate manifestation of the Tamil state of mind. This state of mind is likely to continue until genuine unity is achieved through the creation of a plural and egalitarian society.
The tragedy of independent Sri Lanka has been majoritarian hegemony. Majority rule is a democratic principle. Here it has been interpreted as the majority of the numerically largest ethnicity.
Sri Lanka is a modern State with an ancient civilisation, but the attempt to define Sri Lanka as a modern Nation State has led to conflict and strife. Power is concentrated with the majority ethnicity leaving the others out in the cold. It is a case of Maha Jathiyata Kiri, Sulu Jathiwalata Kekiri. (Cream for the majority, bitter-fruit for the minorities)
The idea of Ceylon was a colonial construct. The British unified the country into a single administration. Sri Lanka was not the only one in this respect. Most countries ruled by the British were their creations in a modern sense.
Ethnic conflict and strife erupted in many countries after the British left. From the Indian sub-continent to Fiji Islands and from Nigeria to Malaysia, there are many instances of this. Sri Lanka too can be classified as an example of post-independence conflict within pre-independence boundaries.
Some ex-colonies have reduced and managed ethnic tensions by evolving new forms of power sharing. They have reinvented themselves as new nations on the basis of equality and forged a strong sense of common identity. In the final analysis, the unity and integrity of a nation do not depend on its military strength or structures of governance but on the will of its people. The nation-state is essentially a state of mind.

Some ex-colonies have reduced and managed ethnic tensions by evolving new forms of power sharing. They have reinvented themselves as new nations on the basis of equality and forged a strong sense of common identity.

The idea of a single Sri Lankan nation has been under severe threat. In reality, we are a divided nation today and military conquest and domination by itself is no answer. If we are to resolve these divisions and create a strong nation on the basis of equitable power-sharing, the structure of the state needs to be radically transformed. There is no consensus on that so far.

Sensible and Pragmatic
The need of the hour is for Tamils to evolve a sensible and pragmatic approach to the situation they are in. What is necessary now is not confrontation but cooperation. Cooperation is not submission. Conciliation is not surrendered.
Those continuing the old politics of sabre-rattling must realise there is no sword or blade in the scabbard or sheath to scare the enemy. Instead, these vocal warriors make laughing stocks of themselves without perhaps realising it.
This inability or unwillingness to recognise the tragic plight of the Tamil people and adopt a practical approach rather than continuing with an unrealistic confrontational mode is not something which evolved in a vacuum. There is a history behind this emotive content in Tamil politics. It has been prevalent ever since the Tamil polity began experiencing political anxiety over the perceived threat of Sinhala majoritarian hegemony.
What is required now is the creation of a just, egalitarian and plural society. There must be equitable power-sharing based on principles of devolution. If one were to simplify the ethnic crisis in Sri Lanka and its potential solution one may say that it is a contest between three ideas. Broadly, three schools of thought have been clashing, namely hegemonism, secessionism and pluralism.
The Sinhala hardliners want Sinhala-Buddhist domination and look upon this country as theirs alone, excluding or reducing others to subservient status in this Chinthana.
They interpret numerical superiority as a divine right to dominate other ethnicities who are treated as children of lesser Gods. Their numerical strength has afforded them the ability to exercise this control through democratic procedures.
They want a Unitary State where the pecking order is clearly established.
The Tamil hardliners want a separate State for the North-East known as Tamil Eelam. Just as Sinhala hawks say Sri Lanka is for the Sinhalese, these Tamil hawks say Tamil Eelam is for the Tamils. The Tigers may have been destroyed militarily but the ideology of tigers still exists. It is fuelled by funds from tigerish elements in the global Tamil Diaspora.
A state for the dominant ethnicity within excludes by definition, other ethnicities living within these real or imaginary borders. Both these Sinhala and Tamil hawkish ideas have brought about disunity, violence and destruction. The nation bled profusely and the country diminished drastically.

Amity and Fraternity
The third idea is that of establishing an egalitarian and plural society where all children of this country can live together in amity and fraternity. It incorporates a vision where no one will claim superior rights on the basis of belonging to the majority race/religion or claim exclusive rights to their historic habitat.
Power will not be confined to Colombo but shared with the periphery. All people regardless of race, religion, caste or creed will have their say and have a role to play.
Sri Lanka will belong to its people from Paruthithurai to Devinuwara and Mannar to Mullaitheevu. At present, this vision seems unrealistically impossible and Utopian!
In spite of the adverse politico-military environment, this is the vision that should ultimately triumph..Visionaries of this nature are an endangered species. They are under attack by hawks on either side of the ethnic divide.
They are dubbed derisively as jokers and traitors. It is, however, this vision that will ultimately salvage Sri Lanka. Hegemonic and secessionist dreams have turned into cruel nightmares. The call for the third option between the hegemonistic one-State and secessionist two-State schools of thought is a voice of sanity and sensibility. It is presently inaudible amidst the raucously divisive cries.
I, however, firmly believe that it will be heard and heard effectively one day. Sri Lanka will then be alive with the sound of concord.
In the clash of ideas, it is the superior one that will triumph. Dialogue and discussion, not bloodshed and destruction, will prove to be final arbiters of our destinies. The current situation is depressing but there is certainly a light at the end of the dark tunnel.

Our Destiny Is Inter-twined
However, estranged and alienated the Tamil people may feel at present, there is no denying the fact that we are an integral part of the Sri Lankan nation. Our destiny is intertwined with those of others living on the Island.
The future lies not in pursuing unrealistic political goals but in struggling together with people seeking justice and peace to forge a brave, new, inclusive nation. It is up to right-thinking members of the majority community to extend their hand of friendship in a spirit of fraternal amity towards like-minded others.
When India gained freedom at midnight, Jawarhalal Nehru spoke of its tryst with destiny. Indias southern neighbour has been awaiting its true destiny for 70 years. The Sri Lankan State needs to be re-structured and the Sri Lankan nation re-invented for its inevitable tryst with destiny. Sri Lanka at 70 faces the unfinished yet challenging task of building a NEW nation! Let me conclude with three verses from the poem Call to Lanka which is one of my favourites. It is by Rev. W.S. Senior. Walter Stanley Senior was a scholar, pastor, teacher and poet who served in Sri Lanka for many years as Vice Principal of Trinity College, Kandy and Vicar at Christ Church, Galle Face.
Inspired by the landscape and people of the Island then called Ceylon, W.S. Senior poetically envisaged a future Lanka of unity and tranquillity where the races had blended and marched to a single drum.
Call To Lanka
Here are three verses from his Call to Lanka-
But most shall he sing of Lanka
In the bright new days that come
When the races all have blended
And the voice of strife is dumb.
When we leap to a single bugle,
March to a single drum.
March to a mighty purpose,
One man from shore to shore;
The stranger becomes a brother,
The task of the tutor oer,
When the ruined city rises
And the palace gleams once more.
Hark! Bard of the fateful future,
Hark! Bard of the bright to be;
A voice on the verdant mountains,
A voice by the golden sea.
Rise, child of Lanka, and answer
Thy mother hath called to thee

Stripping civic rights: UNP says it's for Court to decide
	
UNP MP S.M. Marikkar said yesterday the order to strip politicians of their civic rights should be decided by court and not by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) or any other party for that matter.
He told a news conference that political parties should not involve themselves in legal matters and highlighted the fact that the good governance government had upheld the independence of the judiciary.
Commenting on a statement made by State Minister Dilan Perera that the SLFP would not leave room for the stripping of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa's civic rights, Mr. Marikkar said stripping a person of his civic rights did not depend on the state minister or on any political party.
There is time to strip Mr. Rajapaksa of his civic rights. But action should be first taken against the culprits identified by PRECIFAC as having misappropriated public funds, he said.
The MP said if the High Court convicted any politician and sentenced him or her to a six-month jail term he or she would not be allowed to contest any election or vote for seven years. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Syria may be developing new types of chemical weapons: US
	

REUTERS, 02nd FEBRUARY, 2018-The Syrian government may be developing new types of chemical weapons, and U.S. President Donald Trump is prepared to consider further military action if necessary to deter chemical attacks, senior U.S. officials said on Thursday.
President Bashar al-Assad is believed to have secretly kept part of Syrias chemical weapons stockpile despite a U.S.-Russian deal under which Damascus was supposed to have handed over all such weapons for destruction in 2014, the officials said.
Assads forces have instead evolved their chemical weapons and made continued occasional use of them in smaller amounts since a deadly attack last April that drew a U.S. missile strike on a Syrian air base, the officials told reporters in a briefing. Characteristics of some of those recent attacks suggest that Syria may be developing new weapons and methods for delivering poison chemicals, possibly to make it harder to trace their origin, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity, but they declined to provide specifics.
A deadly sarin attack on a rebel-held area in April prompted Trump to order a missile strike last year on the Shayrat air base, from which the Syrian operation is said to have been launched.

The Uncrowned King of Ceylon
	
Sir Don Baron Jayatilaka was born on February 13, 1868, in Waragoda, a village in Kelaniya as the eldest son of Don Daniel and Elisa Jayatilaka (nee Weerasinghe), the former being from Paththalagedara in Veyangoda, who was a contractor and a founder member of the Vidyalankara Pirivena in Kelaniya.


Mrs Elisa Jayatilaka (nee Weerasinghe) a devoted Buddhist, was a descendant of the highly respected, wealthy Weerasinghe familyof Waragoda.
His initial education was at Vidyalankara Pirivena where he learnt Sinhalese, Pali, Sanskrit and Buddhist literature under scholars such as Ven. Rathmalane Sri Dharmaloka.

This very success ironically proved to be detrimental to Sir Jayatilaka as the British Governor felt that his continued assistance would be required to obtain food aid from the neighbouring country with dangers lurking in the high seas from enemy naval ships tocargo vessels.

Elementary education in the English medium was commenced at a Baptist School in Kelaniya. Secondary education was at Wesley College, Colombo. The siblings were Muhandiram Don Simon Jayatilaka and Mudliyar Don
Abraham Jayatilaka.
Marriage to Mallika Batuwanthudawa, daughter of Pandith Batuwantudawa of Warahena Bentota took place in 1898.
Sir Baron Jayatilaka was also a scholar of high intellect, who revised Buddhist literature in Sinhala, Palli, Sanskrit and English and also Sinhala literature (which had been denied under colonial rule), the founding Chief Editor of the monolingual etymological Sinhala dictionary, an influencer for the publishing of the Dinamina Newspaper of Lake House Publications, a great Buddhist leader, founder and first president of the Young Mens Buddhist Association (YMBA), which position was held for 46 years until his death, President of the All Ceylon Buddhist Congress, President of the Vidyalankara Sabha, initiated Dhamma Schools (Daham Pasal), President of the Royal Asiatic Society of Ceylon, a leading personality of the Temperance Movement, first Buddhist & Sinhala Principal of Ananda College, Colombo also being the first OBA President of the Collage, Founder Principal of Dharmaraja College Kandy and first Manager of Visakha Vidyalaya Colombo. He commenced and managed several Buddhist schools, held the position of General Manager and Secretary of the Buddhist Theosophical Society, one of the founders of Sri Dharmaloka Maha Vidyalaya Kelaniya-now one of the most reputed National School in the Gampaha District in his village at Waragoda, Kelaniya.
Sir D.B Jayatilaka was a barrister qualified with a BA and MA from the University of Calcutta and the University of Oxford respectively, an advocate of the Supreme Court of Ceylon, a very well-respected diplomat, who was the representative for Ceylon in India and represented Ceylon in many International conferences.

The Second World War in the early 1940s created a severe food shortage threatening starvation in the country.


He was a well-respected personality in the country by both the eminent and the common public, therefore, was instrumental in the revival and upgrading of the religious, national and cultural values of the nation that had deteriorated due to colonial rule Sir Baron Jayatilaka had close relationships with intellectual and eminent personnel such as Ven. Rathmalane Sri Dharmarama, Anagarika Dharmapala, Henry Steel Olcott, F.R. Senanayake, Pandith Batuwanthudawa, Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam, D.S. Senanayake, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, C.W.W. Kannangara and T.B. Jayah.
He also understood the pulse of the common man and was a noble personality who spent time with the general public.
Sir Baron Jayatilaka was an outstanding politician and Statesman who towered above his contemporaries. He was a freedom fighter, patriot and leader of the Independence Movement of Ceylon.
He was appointed as President of the Ceylon National Congress in 1923 and was elected to the Legislative Council of Ceylon from the Colombo District, holding the position of Vice President which was the highest position a Ceylonese could hold (British Governor was the President).
Constitutional reforms of the Donoughmore Commission led to universal franchise. Sir Baron Jayatilake was elected to the newly formed State Council of Ceylon from the Kelaniya electorate and became Leader of the House and Minister of Home Affairs in 1931.
It must be emphasised that he was the first elected leader of Ceylon/Sri Lanka through the voting rights of the people of this country and was the Leader of the House in the State Council  a position equivalent to that of Prime Minister.
This is a fact that has not been appreciated adequately.
Being a remarkable administrator with good governance, immense popularity among all nationalities and the towering personality as compared to his peers led to Sir Baron Jayatilake being re-elected uncontested to represent the Kelaniya electorate and continue as the undisputed leader of the State Council of Ceylon.
Sir Baron Jayatilaka was the first Ceylonese to prepare the Budget speech for Ceylon as the Leader of the State Council and under his administration as the Leader of the House not only the Ministry of Home Affairs that was led by him, especially the Ministers of Agriculture, Education and Health were supported to perform with outstanding results to serve the public of the country.
He also was the Buddhist and State leader who was most instrumental in the renovations of the Ruwanweli Maha Seya and was the State leader at the pinnacle laying ceremony of the Stupa in 1941.
As the Leader of the State Council Sir Baron Jayatilaka was the greatest strength of C.W.W Kannangara, the Minister of Education to overcome barriers to pass the Free Education Bill.
Rightfully, and most deservedly he was conferred Knighthood for the services rendered
to Ceylon.
This great man was the Guru of most pre and post-independence leaders of our country, including some leaders who later became Prime Ministers of
Independent Ceylon.
He sacrificed his personal wealth to fund the independence movement but also donated most of his assets to the State.
The Public Trustee Offices at Bauddhaloka Mawatha, Colombo 07 (Thurban House- A palatial building) was gifted to the State.
The Sir D.B Jayatilaka Trust presently is the richest State-owned Trust comprising of a range of revenue generating assets.
The Second World War in the early 1940s created a severe food shortage threatening starvation in the country.
The British Colonial administration and the then Ministers of Agriculture, Trade and Commerce with officials were unsuccessful in negotiations with the Government of India as India too were suffering similar shortages. Sir Baron Jayatilaka being the first Ceylonese to be the President of the Indian Students Association at the University of Oxford at the time he read for the MA and later having closely associated with the Indian National Congress leaders during their Independence struggle, had developed personal friendships with the
Indian leaders. The British Governor made a desperate request to Sir Baron Jayatilaka, who went to India and requested food aid.
As a result of the respect and tremendous regard that the Indian leaders had for Sir Baron Jayatilaka, food aid was provided to Ceylon.
This very success ironically proved to be detrimental to Sir Baron Jayatilaka as the British Governor felt that his continued assistance would be required to obtain food aid from the neighbouring country with dangers lurking in the high seas from enemy naval ships to
cargo vessels.
Sir Baron Jayatilaka hence sacrificed his position at the State Council in 1942 to comply with the request of the Governor and undertook to function as the Representative (High Commissioner) of the Government of Ceylon in India.
The position of Leader of the House in the State Council was then filled by D. S. Senanayake, whom the vast majority in the country regarded as being his deputy and who later became the first Prime Minister of Ceylon. Sir Baron Jayatilake fell ill in 1944 whilst in India and decided to undergo medical treatment in his motherland, in stark contrast to the high and mighty of today. However, he passed away in the aircraft allocated by the Viceroy of India on May 29, 1944.
The last words uttered were Are we in Ceylon and breathed his last whilst the plane was over
Indian territory. Don Baron Jayatilaka the great Philosopher was spoken of as Uncrowned King by the Ceylonese of all walks of life and the highest respect was paid to Sir Jayatilaka by the State of Ceylon with an Official State Funeral attended by a large number of people from all parts of the Country.
Sir Jayatilaka was declared an outstanding National Hero produced by Mother Lanka.

UNP confident of winning 276 LG bodies
	
Based on a survey conducted by the UNP, the party is confident of winning 276 out of the 341 local government bodies at the February 10 polls, Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera said yesterday.
He said the survey also indicated that the TNA would win 51 local government bodies in the North and East.
The deputy minister told the media that the UNPs grassroots level organizations were functioning at their best and would help secure an overwhelming victory for the party.
The grassroots level preparation for the election by the SLFP and the SLPP is week and disorganized while we have launched an aggressive and successful election propaganda campaign at ground level. The other political parties lack that advantage and thus our victory on February 10 is assured, he said.
The deputy minister said reforms were introduced to the LG electoral system, despite protests by other political parties and this had resulted in the entire country enjoying its benefits.
"There are no reports of violence, no wasteful expenditure, no posters and cutouts, no polythene no intra-party or inter-party rivalry during the election campaigns. This is the best outcome of the new electoral system and the UNP must get the credit," he said.
Responding to the challenge thrown by MP Udaya Gammanpila, the deputy minister said it was on page 149 that the PRECIFAC report recommends that former president Mahinda Rajapaksa be stripped of his civic rights if found guilty of defrauding the ITN of Rs.300 million," the deputy minister said. The PRECIFAC report clearly recommends that if convicted, Mahinda Rajapaksa must be barred from contesting for any political office and of holding any political or public office. The report also recommends that politicians found guilty of embezzlement of public funds must also be stripped of their civic rights for life.
The deputy minister said those harsh recommendations can also be applied to all members of the Rajapaksa family -- Gotabaya, Basil, Namal, Yoshitha and other SLPP members who have been brought before the law for multiple of crimes such as Gammanpila, Mahinda Yapa, Aluthgamage, Johnston and several others.
Responding to a journalist, he said the UNP working committee would meet shortly to decide on MP Ravi Karunanayaka who refused to resign in line with a request of the party. Pic by Pradeep Dilrukshana. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
