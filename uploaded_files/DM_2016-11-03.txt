Bank of Ceylon green banking goes with digitization
	
The Bank of Ceylon (BoC) as the leading bank in Sri Lanka, has always acted as a responsible financial institution by creating the best solutions for its customers in an environmentally-friendly manner.
The bank has incorporated green banking as a strategic business initiative to its business process. Green banking is still an evolving concept that has emerged in recent years. Its core idea is to engage in any form of banking which the community gets environmentally benefitted through its practices.
The importance of the banking industry being involved in green initiatives comes through its importance in playing the role in economic development through financial intermediation. The banking sector acts as a major partner in financial inclusion therefore vested on its economic power it can promote environmentally sustainable and socially responsible investments and projects.
For the Bank of Ceylon Success is always to gain sustainable growth together with the wellbeing of the community, therefore the idea is embedded as an integral part in the banks core mission. Understanding the economic, social and environmental needs the bank evolved its approach overtime towards this mission without compromising the environment at any cost. The Digital Transformation was one big advancement we made towards this goal to make a better environment through digitization, said BoC Chairman Presidents Counsel Ronald C. Perera.
Through this transformation process BOC has been able to alter its systems, processors, communication channels and manage all its resources not only to yield best economic advantages for the bank and its customers but also to engage in environment related best practices comprehensively. Perera further stated.
With the best practices that came along with the digital transformation the bank was able to move into a green process where day-to-day banking operations specially paper work was replaced by technology and made to be seamless and thus minimized waste including and carbon emission. Smart Products such as SmartGen were introduced replace conventional savings accounts that use passbooks where there were a lot of paper usage. SmartZones were introduced for paperless transactions 24 x 7. These products and services have changed the banks customer interface completely providing utmost convenience. Internally the bank has adapted a comprehensive Document Management System (DMS) and E-learning facility for employee training.
We at bank of Ceylon had many on-going environmentally-friendly programs that have been there for several years. The bank has moved into a comprehensive green banking approach that is heavily aided by the digital transformation. With that we have introduced green processes, green products and services, strategies and green infrastructure that includes IT and physical infrastructure,  said General Manager D.M. Gunasekeara.
Encouraging the business community to adapt environmental best practices is an important initiative that a banking institution can do. The Bank of Ceylon takes a special care in projects and business lending to make sure that those financed projects are environmentally-friendly. It even encourages customers, especially in the SME and Corporate segments to execute projects that use renewable energy and installation of renewable energy, waste management, recycling/ up-cycling projects and energy saving projects. Partnering to build the NSBM Campuses new premises is a very recent such project the Bank of Ceylon worked with keen interest which was not only a green project but also addresses one major area of banks social sustainability which is education, Gunasekara added
Apart from best practices adapted through digitalization, the Bank of Ceylon has been engaged in green initiatives such as paper recycling, E-waste management, installing eco-friendly equipments, installing energy efficient lighting systems in branches and head office, maintaining green gardens at selected branches with rain water harvesting systems.
The solar powered system in selected branches is also a recent addition to the banks green banking process. Commenting on special achievements that is note worthy; during the past three years only BoC was able to recycle 389,440 kg of paper that was calculated to save 6621 fully-grown trees which otherwise would have been cut-down for this purpose and planted 100,000 trees in line with the banks 75th anniversary in 2014 gathering school children and public from all over the country.
The banks Kilinochchi branch was endorsed as a green branch recently as it was designed to have a solar energy system and utilizes space and architectural design to obtain more natural light and air, vertical green garden to keep the interior cool, rain water harvesting system and a SmartZone for digital banking.

Cabinet raises age of criminal responsibility from 8 to 12
	
Cabinet on Tuesday (1) decided to increase the minimum age of criminal responsibility to 12 years from the current minimum age which is 8 and in case of children who were between the ages of 12 and 14 to confer discretion to the Magistrate.
The Penal Code will be amended accordingly, Cabinet spokesman, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Cabinet was told that Psychologists and other experts have opined that 8 was far too young an age at which to incur criminal responsibility and accordingly, it had decided to publish the above Bill in a Gazette and subsequently present it to Parliament for approval.
In cases involving children aged between 12 and 14 it was decided to confer discretion to a Magistrate to determine whether such a child was liable to be punished to the full extent of the law.
The Cabinet also gave the green light to go ahead with obtaining compensation under International law on leakage of fuel into the ocean due to accidents that occur while shipping in the territorial waters of Sri Lanka.
At present, 80 countries have obtained the membership of the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage, which is being enforced since 2008 for paying compensation for parties affected with the spreading of bunker oil due to accidents of ships.

President Maithripala Sirisena said today the investigations into the Central Bank issue should be free of political interference and he would forward it for an impartial and independent judicial process.
He expressed these views while participating at the launch of an SLFP membership drive at Maharagama.
President Sirisena said he came out of the previous government and became the President with the support of everyone, not to punish those who committed wrongs while allowing the others to do wrong.
My policy regarding this bond issue is all politicians should stay away from the investigations and it should be forwarded to the courts for an impartial and independent legal action. This is not an issue that the politicians can resolve, he said.
The COPE has presented a report according to the standing orders in Parliament and our constitution. People have different opinions on this report. Some say it is wrong while some others say it if right. It is the politicians who say so. They may be wrong or right. We should look at them carefully, he said.
The President said he would take legal advice and forward the report to the court for an impartial probe and a verdict.
Then we can see who is wrong Who is right Who is clean and who is not, he said. (Muditha Dayananda)

CV complains to EU about SL army running schools
	
Northern Province Chief Minister C.V.Wigneswaran has complained to the European Union (EU) human rights inspection team that the Sri Lankan army is running hundreds of schools in his province when it has no right to do so under the 13th amendment of the constitution, New Indian Express reported today. 
Quoting the Tamil daily Thinakkural, it said Wigneswaran had complained that in Vavuniya, Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu districts, the armys Civil Defense Unit is running 344 primary schools, employing 689 Tamil women as teachers at good salaries, when as per the constitution, school education is a devolved subject and schools in the province are to be run by the provincial ministry of education.
The number of teachers in the army-run primary schools is the same as the number of teachers working in the provincial council-run primary schools, the Chief Minister pointed out in his interaction with the EU headed by Jean Lambert MEP last Saturday.
He also said that in the schools run by the army, teachers are made to wear a uniform which has raised concerns among the people as to whether they are being recruited to the army.
Wigneswaran strongly opposed a suggestion by former President Chandrika Kumaratunga that Tamil women employees of the provincial administration be posted in police stations to deal with cases involving women. He said that Tamil women do not want to work in police stations. As an alternative, he suggested that educated Tamil women be recruited to the provincial administration to liaise between women supplicants and the police. But no action has been taken on his suggestion, the Chief Minister told the EU team.
The team was in Sri Lanka until Tuesday to assess Sri Lankas eligibility to get back the GSP-plus trade concessions in terms of its human rights record. Sri Lanka had lost the concessions in 2010 on account of its poor rights record at that time.
Wigneswarans objection to Tamil women working in police stations stems from the fear that their security might be at stake, given the fact that the Sri Lankan police force is almost completely uni-ethnic with Sinhalese having an overwhelming presence and thirty years of war has colored the Tamils perception of the police.
The CM complained about the army using 50,000 acres of land in the Northern Province to cultivate crops and trade in them, while the original Tamil owners of the lands are looking to others to give them food. Sinhalese fishermen from the South fish in Northern waters even using illegal methods with the help of the armed forces while local Tamil fishermen are denied the right, and even taken into custody for alleged illegal fishing.
The CM asked the EU delegation to press the Sri Lankan government to withdraw the army from the North since the war had ended seven years ago. In his estimation, 100,000 troops are still stationed in his province. De-militarization of the North is one of the 15 stipulations of the EU for restoring GSP-Plus trade concessions.

Drug addict sells kidney to satisfy urge for heroin
	
A drug addict who sold his kidney for Rs.500,000 and used the money to finance his heroin addiction was taken into custody by the Galle police after he was found in possession of a packet heroin weighing 100mg during a raid at Dangedara. Investigations revealed that he had gone to Colombo after selling his kidney and spent Rs.120,000 to buy heroin and returned to Galle after all his money was exhausted.
The 36-year-old suspect is a resident of Devata in Galle and a bachelor making his livelihood as a manual worker who is known to spend all his earnings to satisfy his urge for heroin. Recently when he came to know that a resident who was suffering from an acute kidney ailment had been recommended by the doctors to undergo an immediate kidney transplant, he visited the patient and agreed to donate his kidney for Rs.500,000. However the patient had died two weeks after the kidney transplant while the donor wasted the money he was paid.
The suspect was produced before the Galle Magistrate yesterday on charges of possessing 100mg of heroin.
The arrest was made after Anti Vice Squad OIC Sub Inspector M. Nimal, Sergeant 58987 Hasantha, PCs 33645 Ranjith, 4500 Pushpakumara 14353 Madanayake, and 80645 Asiri conducted the investigations on the instructions of HQI Udaya Kumara. (D.G. Sugathapala)

Epic Lanka has joined hands with the Association of Professional Bankers (APB) as platinum sponsor for its 28th anniversary convention.
The annual convention of the Association of Professional Bankers (APB) is the countrys premier forum that brings together leading banking professionals, industry experts and academics to share domain knowledge, discuss issues and generate new ideas for the development of the industry. It also facilitates networking among the stakeholders of the financial services industry.
The convention is the key learning and development activity organized by the APB and it is aimed at realizing APBs primary objectives of undertaking, promoting and facilitating studies in the field of banking, while promoting fellowship and dialogue among members, thus playing a vital role in equipping the bankers with the requisite knowledge and skills for the improvement of the banking system in
the country.
Shashi Kandambi Jassim, President of the APB commenting on this years theme of the convention- Thriving in a Digital World said, Digitalization today has become so inherent in the way we do business. If we do not embrace this change and adapt ourselves expeditiously, we are bound to be left behind. Take the Banking fraternity as an example where digitalization is fast changing our payment ecosystem. Retail payments around the world are shifting on to digital platforms for easier and more flexible payment options using digital devices. Even the internal banking service processes have to be digitalized in order to cater to the customers who demand services through digital media. This proves that the theme we have chosen is timely and relevant to all of us in the financial services industry. I am particularly happy that an illustrious line-up of eminent speakers and panelists who are ready to share their knowledge and experiences at our convention, added Jassim.
Dr. Nayana Dehigama the Executive Chairman and Managing Director of Epic Lanka said, We are delighted to partner APB as its platinum sponsor for the third time.
The theme of the convention Thriving in a Digital World is highly relevant, timely and appropriate for every player in the Financial Services Industry. Digitalization is no more a feature to win competitive edge. It is fast becoming a requisite for survival. Thus, having a dialogue on digitalization to share knowledge on why banks should embrace digitalization as a modern business strategy and how to overcome challenges in digitalization is very vital for the banking industry.

NDB Wealth advises financial independence to light up your Deepavali
	
Deepavali, or the Hindu festival of lights, as it is also commonly known, is a time when you fix up and decorate your home, buy new clothes for yourself and your family and take part in festivities with your community.
Embodying the triumph of light over dark, Deepavali is the celebration of Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, fortune and prosperity. And, prior to celebrating Deepavali, Hindus the world over get ready for future prosperity by aligning all their actions to receive it, which has a deeper meaning not only for Hindus but for everyone. If you want to be successful, be ready for that success.
Additionally, it is precisely during occasions like the colourful and festive Deepavali that expert financial planner NDB Wealth recommends that far-thinking individuals, no matter what they believe in, think about how they can achieve financial independence, which for many can mean the difference between a safe and secure future, or having to worry should emergency medical expenditures arise.
To get you started, the financial planners at NDB Wealth suggest the following, six-point plan to help manage your money more effectively: 1. Set a strict budget; 2. Regularly review finances to identify any wasted money; 3. Look at cutting unnecessary spending and luxuries; 4. Maintain a record of actual spending to compare against the budget; 5. Reconcile bank and credit card statements against spending records; and 6. Devise a savings plan, even if the amount is only a small amount a month.
You can take action and alleviate your worries by periodically keeping a close eye on spending and creditworthiness. This can be done in a number of ways, with several apps, calculators, spreadsheets, etc. available online, to assist you in managing finances. In fact, NDB Wealth offers its own online financial utility, The NDB Wealth Planner, available on www.ndbwealth.com, which can prove very useful for your future financial planning, comments Christina Wesley, Financial Advisor with NDB Wealth.

NGOs only protecting rights of suspects, criminals: Justice Minister
	
A majority of the Human Rights groups and NGOs in the country were only protecting the rights of suspects and criminals, instead of looking into the grievances of victims or witnesses, Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said today.
Addressing the inauguration ceremony of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Assistance and Protection Division of the Police, the Minister said there was no single NGO or civil organization in the country to look in to the grievances of victims or witness.
That is a sad part. Everybody is concerned about the suspects and prisoners. That is good. But at the same time they should also think about what would happen if the rights of victims and witnesses are not protected, he said.
Rajapakshe said that sometimes the victims take law into their hands because they had no confidence in the judicial system.
There will be anarchy, if the victims and witnesses were neglected. It has happened in this country before, he said.
The Justice Minister added that the Crime and Witnesses Assistance and Protection Law was a historical one because there were more than thousands of laws to deal with criminals and their offences, but there was not a single law to safeguard the rights and interests of victims and witnesses.

While vowing that the government was determined to take strict legal action against those who were allegedly involved in the Bond scam, Cabinet Spokesman Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said there was no mention whatsoever in the COPE report or in the Auditor Generals review on the issue to level the accusing finger at Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Addressing the weekly Cabinet news briefing yesterday, Minister Senaratne said there was no iota of evidence to suggest any involvement of Mr. Wickremesinghe in this sordid affair despite the virulent attempts by the Joint Opposition to drag him into the controversy.
Even, COPE Chairman, Parliamentarian Sunil Handunnnetti has said that no one gave evidence against Mr. Wickremesinghe during the oversight committees inquiry in Parliament. The Auditor General hasnt said anything against Mr. Wickremesinghe in his report either. The JO is doing this with malice and vengeance, Minister Senaratne stressed.
Minister Senaratne said it was Premier Wickremesinghe who took the initiative to refer the COPE report to the Auditor General to see the possibility of taking legal action against those who have been found to be involved in the Bond scam and also to the Central Bank to inquire the controversy to determine whether there was any misappropriation of public money in the bond market.
Do you think he would have done this if he has anything to do with the scam Dont forget that Mahinda Rajapaksa regime did not take any action against a large number of politicians and officials who had highly incriminating evidence of misappropriation of public money and other mismanagements against them in more than 10 COPE reports. They all ended up in the dust bins. No one can criticise Mr. Wickremesinghe for appointing Arjuna Mahendran as the Governor because he was a reputed diplomat and an academic, he emphasised.

Do not indulge in fattening your pet child

By Thusitha Malasekera
Watching a baby making its first attempt at standing up after the initial stages of crawling, the parents derive much happiness. They are pleased with the extra nourishment they provided the baby, which is clearly indicated in the healthy muscles and limbs.
The parents are thrilled when a child begins to walk and think that a chubby and healthy child is a great gift to them. They are not the least concerned about the child being classed as obese.
The World Health Organization (WHO) had classified the obese or overweight children as being due to accumulation of fat in an unusual manner in children creating a danger in the health of children.
Obesity or overweight was significantly observed up to recent times in developed countries. During the past few decades the prevalence of Obesity in children had risen greatly in Sri Lanka too.
Obesity in childhood causes a wide range of serious complications, and increases the risk of premature illness and death in later life, raising public concerns. Nutritionists are of the view that 10 percent of the preschool and primary school children of urban areas are prone to be to be obese or overweight.
Out of these children many belong to the affluent and upper middle class families. Results of research have provided new insights into the physiological basis of body weight regulations.
The fundamental cause of childhood overweight and obesity is an energy imbalance between calories consumed and calories expended.
Global increases in childhood obesity are attributable to a number of factors including, intake of energy- dense foods that are high in fat and sugars but low in vitamins, minerals and other healthy and other nutrients.
For example consumption of sausages, meat balls, burghers and pizzas and the intake of sugary drinks.
A tendency towards decreased physical activity levels due to the increasingly sedentary nature of many forms of recreation times. Long hours at the computers engaging in video games avoiding any type of outdoor sports activities and the increasing urbanization had led to the increasing prevalence of child obesity.
Many questions had been raised about the reason for so many studies on child obesity.
It is because child obesity is considered as one of the most serious public health challenges of the 21st century. The problem is global and is steadily affecting many low and middle income countries like Sri Lanka, particularly in urban settings.
The overweight and obese children are likely to stay obese into adulthood and more likely to develop non-communicable diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular diseases at a younger age.
Childhood obesity has been associated with diabetes, the early onset of metabolic syndrome, sub clinical inflammation, dyslipidemia, coronary artery diseases, and adulthood obesity.
Unlike most adults, children and adolescents cannot choose the environment in which they live or the food they eat. They also have a limited ability to understand the long-term consequences of their behaviour. They therefore require special attention when fighting the obesity epidemic.

Long hours at the computers engaging in video games avoiding any type of outdoor sports activities and the increasing urbanization had led to the increasing prevalence of child obesity.

In Sri Lanka too with the requirement of both parents having to earn, mothers no longer have the time to prepare a proper balanced diet for the children. Therefore it has become a frequent sight to see parents at fast food outlets, getting their children the food they require. However, most of these fast food contain additives and fats and also high levels of sugar and salts, which contribute to the obesity in children, which also results in many complications later in life.
In addition regular physical activity through parental initiative and social support interventions can be considered also as important strategies in managing childhood obesity. Physical activity as defined by the WHO is the bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that require energy expenditure.
Physical activity includes exercise as well as other activities, which involve bodily movements and are done as part of playing, working, active transportation, house chores and recreational activities. A few years ago children did not have the kind of computer games and gadgets, resulting neighborhood groups coming together and participating in play. However, with the advancement of technology children are more addicted to their computer games so that outdoor play or physical activity like even cycling, becoming almost redundant.
Adequate sleep is also necessary as been awake in long hours of the night causes fatigue and loss of interest in studies.
The parents should be always cautious about the behavior of their children when growing up and any unusual pattern in their daily lives should have their concern and specialist medical treatment obtained.

Perpetual Treasuries licence should be cancelled: JO
	
The joint oppositions economic research unit yesterday urged the government to cancel the primary dealer licence of Perpetual Treasuries Limited allegedly connected to the Central Bank bond scam.
Addressing a media briefing, joint opposition member Prof. G.L. Peiris said the first step which would be taken after the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) report was to cancel the primary dealer licence of this company as it had been proved that it was directly connected to the Central Bank bond scam.
Prof. Peiris also said it was surprising that Central Bank Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy had complained to the Criminal Investigation Division (CID) regarding the disclose of a secret document belonging to the Central Bank under the supervision of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Mr. Coomaraswamy has complained the CID to investigate this matter which had disclosed information related to the Central Bank bond sale scam. The government is attempting to find out those who had disclosed it instead of penalizing the wrongdoers, he added.
Meanwhile, joint opposition MP Bandula Gunewardena said apparently there was a loss of Rs. 1, 000 billion incurred by the government from the Central Bank bond sale scam through the Perpetual Treasuries Limited which had being taken place between February 27, 2015 and March 2016.

## Title: Stroke Preventable with early detection

Stroke Preventable with early detection
	
By Sarah Muiz
Being susceptible to stroke is not a healthy symptom that bodes well with any individual since a stroke attack could lead to permanent brain damage or worse, it could lead to death, if not detected and prevented at an early stage. 
According to World Health Organization statistics based on the Global Status Report on Non Communicable Diseases for 2014, an estimated 6.7 million deaths reported in 2012 were mainly due to strokes. 
Issuing a statement on the World Stroke Day on October 29, WHO Regional Director for South East Asia Dr. Poonam Khetrapal Singh also stressed that over 11 million attacks of stroke occur in low and middle income countries every year, which include those of the WHO South-East Asia Region. 
The need for early detection, prevention and public awareness on stroke is thus pivotal to ensure a healthy well-being. 
In an interview with the Mirror Medicine, Consultant Neurologist and Head of the Stroke Ward at the National Hospital of Sri Lanka Dr. Padma Gunaratne shared her expert opinion on the different aspects of stroke, its causes and early detection; in an attempt to shed more light and raise public awareness concerning a non-communicable disease believed to be the second leading cause of death for those above the age of sixty years. 
Excerpts:QCould you explain what a stroke is
A stroke could be defined as rapidly developing neurological symptoms that happen secondary to a vascular etiology. There are two types of strokes that could occur. The first could be a bleeding in the brain known as a Hemorrhagic Stroke and the second is the blocking of a vain caused by a blood clot also known as an Ischemic Stroke. 
QIn your opinion, what is the leading cause for the increasing rate of strokes reported in Sri Lanka
Worldwide, nearly six million people die, while fifteen million people suffer due to stroke every year. However, seventy to eighty percent of strokes are reported from countries in low- income, developing countries in this part of the world. Lack of sufficient public awareness on stroke is one of the main reasons, leading to the increasing rates of strokes reported in the country. It should be noted that at least seventy percent of stroke attacks are preventable, if detected early. 

QWhat are the leading causes resultingin a stroke
Stroke is a non-communicable disease. Having non communicable diseases such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, obesity and diabetes in addition to smoking tobacco and alcohol consumption could easily lead to the development of a stroke attack. 

QCould you elaborate on the best possible way to prevent a stroke
The best possible ways to prevent strokes are through healthy diet practices, regular exercise, and early detection of risk factors-such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes, followed by proper treatment. 
Abstaining from alcohol consumption and smoking tobacco, treating heart diseases and the early detection of stroke symptoms are also very good preventive measures against stroke. Over the years, the Government has conducted lots of tests to control blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol through various health screening programmes. However, many patients carry misconceptions with regard to continuing the pills prescribed to them as a part of their treatment procedure. 
They dont realize the value of getting themselves screened. Neither do they realize that treatment should be continued once commenced if they are diagnosed with an illness. For instance, if a person is diagnosed with high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes, he or she will have to take several medicines in order to ensure that ones health condition does not develop into a stroke or heart attack in the later stages. People are not very knowledgeable on this regard and are not aware on how to detect stroke symptoms. There are many heart diseases such as weak heart or valve diseases in which case doctors recommend various medicines part of the treatment. This helps in the process of monitoring the patients blood cells, to ensure that the blood is adequately thin and not excessively thin. 


These medical tests must be done once a month by patients to ensure that they do not develop an attack. 
Due to a lack of understanding many patients disregard these issues by discontinuing their medication and not attending medical checkups regularly; especially for a blood test. It should be noted that ignoring ones heart disease could also lead up to a stroke in the long run. 
Finally, immediate action should be taken following the recognition of stroke symptoms in order to prevent the actual stroke attack from taking place.
For example if one side of the entire body become numb for about ten minutes and if it is not recognized as a stroke symptom, the patient will not seek immediate medical attention and wait until the worst attack takes place. 
Unfortunately, this is what happens in most cases. Therefore, more awareness should be created among people with regard to stroke prevention and early detection. 

QIs there a specific age group vulnerable to stroke attacks
Stroke is very much related to age. For those above sixty years, stroke is considered as the second leading cause of death. However, if a person, diagnosed with diabetes and high blood pressure continues smoking, such an individual would also be vulnerable to develop a stroke at a much younger age. 

QIn the context of Sri Lanka, do you think that peoples vulnerability to develop a stroke is greater than before
Yes. With the urbanized lifestyle we have got adopted to, people lack sufficient exercise and are accustomed to consuming a very unhealthy diet. Factors such as increased stress, lack of awareness of stroke and a lack of concern for the general wellbeing, have also increased the risk of strokes. 

QWhat important message do you have for the public concerning strokes
Stroke is preventable and treatable. There are many things the hospitals can do to treat stroke patients. 
People need to be more aware about stroke related issues and national steps should be taken on a government scale, to prevent such a disastrous disease from taking root in peoples lives. 

While people should be knowledgeable on how to detect stroke symptoms, it is equally important to ensure that a person suffering from a stroke attack should be rushed immediately to the major hospital within the vicinity. 

Stroke is treatable!
Seek immediatemedical treatment

By Chathuri Perera
According to experts stroke is the second leading cause of death and the leading cause of disability in Sri Lanka. In order to minimize the damage caused by a stroke, we first have to pay attention to risk factors.
Up to 80 percent of all strokes can be prevented by early detection.
Nursing sister of the Stroke Unit in Sri Jayewardenepura Hospital A.G. Kaburugamuwa in a discussion with the Daily Mirror highlighted the importance of raising awareness on the deadly attack of a stroke
Though there are factors we cant change, mainly unhealthy life styles of people and their carelessness expose them to the risk of a stroke attack, Kaburugamuwa said.
A stroke is an emergency and it happens, when the blood supply to a part of the brain is interrupted.
Stroke loosely used term to describe neurological changes lasting more than 24 hours caused by an interruption in the blood supply to a part of the brain.
If the blood flow ceases for an extended period of time, the cerebral tissues involved die causing permanent neurological deficits. Due to this the opposite sides of the body from the affected side of the brain become paralyzed.
Mainly there are two types of strokes. Strokes categorised as Ischemic Strokes occur when a blood clot forms in a blood vessel in the brain and blocks the blood flow. Some strokes are caused by bleeding in the brain due to a rupture of a blood vessel in the brain. This is called Hemorrhagic Stroke.
What are the warning signals of a stroke
  Sudden severe headache for no reason or an unexplained change in the pattern of headaches.
	  Sudden blurring or decrease in vision in one or both eyes.
	  Sudden weakness or numbness of face, arms and legs.
	  Sudden difficulty in walking, dizziness, loss of balance or an unexplained fall.
	  Sudden difficulty in swallowing.
	  Difficulty in speaking or understanding Sometimes these symptoms may be present for a long period of time, or it may last only a few minutes to a few hours. Such symptoms should never be ignored, especially those who are at the risk of having a stroke. These symptoms indicate that a part of the body is not receiving sufficient blood; such a condition if neglected may lead to a stroke. If you or someone you know experience any of the above warning signals, seek medical attention immediately.

How are strokes treated
A person suffering a brain stroke should seek immediate medical attention of an expert Neurologist. If a stroke is identified within three and half hours and the patient is admitted to hospital, doctors can give immediate attention -the rtPA injection (recombinant tissue Plasminogen Activator. Thats the immediate drug treatment method, which aims at reducing the extent of brain damage.
If more than three and half hours have lapsed for a person suffering a stroke to seek medical treatment, the delay may have already caused damage to the persons brain. In such instances it is the general practice of doctors to direct the patient towards rehabilitation. A patient should receive rehabilitation treatment according to his or her condition. This treatment will be determinant of the patients optimum recovery from stroke.
A multidisciplinary team of Doctors, nurses, Physiotherapists, Speech therapists, Nutritionists, Psychologists and Sociologists will attend to the patient during this course of treatment. They will help the patient to be independent and regain his or her normal lifestyle.
Following the treatment given at the hospital, the manner in which a brain stroke patient is treated and cared for at home is also an important component of recovery.
Although such a patient maybe partially paralyzed, family members and loved ones must make it a point to take care of the patients needs.
The patient will try to ignore the paralyzed side of the body because he will not feel anything in this part of the body. Therefore the patient should be encouraged to give attention on the paralyzed side of the body.
Those around should attempt to speak to the patient facing the paralyzed side of his body, so that he will try to respond through that part of the body. The patient will sleep in the same angle for prolonged periods due to numbness. In such an instance his caregivers should be very attentive so that the patient will not develop bed sores.
The patient should not be allowed to feel lonely. Friends and relatives should be mindful to keep in constant contact with him and encourage conversation with the patient. Then he will receive speech therapy automatically.
The patient should receive physiotherapy treatments. Paralyzed body parts of the patient should receive some exercise. Those at home should help him to move hands and legs slowly.
Patients who have swallowing problems should receive food through a nasogastric (NG) tube . At home the caregiver should have a adequate knowledge and practice about the use of a NG tube.
The patient should also receive a well nourished diet in order to regain his strength.
