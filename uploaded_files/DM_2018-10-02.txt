Army ready to fight drug trafficking: Army Chief
	
Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake said that the Army was prepared to undertake the task of eradication of drug menace from the country, if powers were granted.
Drug smuggling poses the biggest threat to our country as at present, he said.
The Army is already playing a role in this regard to curb the menace by exchanging intelligence with the Police and the Special Task Force. We provide information we receive to the Police from both internal and external sources. So do the Navy and the Air Force, the Commander said.
Speaking to the media after attending the 69th Army Anniversary Flag Blessing ceremony at Anuradhapura Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi premises, the Army Commander said the Government expected to transfer legal powers to the Army to curb drug menace.
We hope to eradicate this destructive menace from the country, if such authority is vested in us. Drug prevention should be carried out after coordinating all agencies together for creation of a better society, Lieutenant General Senanayake said.
Commenting on LTTE commemoration in North, the Commander said commemoration of war-affected late Tamil civilians was no issue since it was their prerogative.
However, if the LTTE is commemorated, we need to be cautious and concerned. But a programme of that nature which lasts for about one hour or so would in no way pose a threat to the national security concerns. That is not to be interpreted a breakdown of national security as such, he said.
He said all three forces were well geared to face any national security threat at any time. But no such question arises as at present, he said.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

Caring and snaring in the name of fostering
	
We should establish a proper screening system for foster parents
	Theresa hugeamount of emotional abuse experienced by these children which cannot even be defined
We dont simply allow them to leave the orphanages because we know that they havereached an age where they are quite mischievous and stubborn
	They are brought up from the day they reach these homes, but after they reach 18 years of age, they are expected to be independent

In most instances orphanages ask for money and dry rations. But that is not what the children want. They would want a toy or a favourite food. Hence an evil system has been created.
Professor Harendra De Silva


There are many different institutions including orphanages run by the privatesector
	In 2017 we handed over 279 children back to their guardians
	Limitations in adapting the foster care system


Every child born to this world has a mother and a father. But not every mother and father will be ready to accept their child. Hence, the possibilities are such that a child could be abandoned for the rest of its life, sometimes at a tender age. This is why stories featuring two to three- week-old infants abandoned by the roadside are occasionally reported. While every child needs parental care and affection; in certain instances parents are not ready to give the necessary care due to various reasons. Most children never get to see their parents while some others are taken away when they are in their teens. In Sri Lanka, care homes or orphanages are actual homes to many children who are abandoned or neglected by their parents. They are brought up from the day they reach these homes, but after they reach 18 years of age, they are expected to be independent. However, many among them arent ready to face the society yet and often become victims again. With no support, money and guidance they are often led on to the wrong paths. Who needs to be responsible for them after they leave the places which provide them with care Whether they are safe and what they would do afterwards are few of the many questions that begs answers.
In such a backdrop, the Daily mirror spoke to a few care leavers who related their rather heartening stories and also spoke to experts to find out what is being done and what needs to be done for the betterment of these youth.

Stranded in society
Once a child reaches its adolescent years, he or she has to leave these orphanages as per the law of the country. But theDaily mirror learned that in most instances such children are asked to leave by the age of 16 if they fail their O/L examination. The plight of care leavers is such that they are being brought up from a young age within a care home and provided with all facilities. But once they are asked to leave, most of them are not ready to face society yet. They feel stranded and become victims again. Due to the stigma associated with them, they are often misled and are provoked to take wrong turns in life. Hence girls have a tendency to end-up at a spa or a massage parlour while boys are taken to do odd jobs such as carpentry or domestic work in houses. Care leavers dont have a valid birth certificate nor an identity card. Their addresses are usually that of their orphanage and since they dont have a permanent address on their ID they are deprived of their basic right to vote. Amidst such a backdrop there are a few who are striving to do well in life and are hoping for a brighter future. TheDaily mirror spoke to a few of them;
The plight of Dinushka
*Dinushka doesnt have both her parents and was sent to Colombo after she sat for her Ordinary Level Exam (O/Ls) in 2009. Although she has been married for five years her journey so far has had more downs than ups. I was enrolled for a training course and sent to Colombo. I did everything on my own. I wasnt prepared to do a job and I was financially handicapped. So I had to do a job. I was reluctant to speak to strangers, but I gained confidence. There was nobody to advise us on what we should do after we leave our homes. I remember once when I was admitted to hospital to undergo surgery I had no one beside me. It was then that I realised why everybody needs a mother in life. My husband also doesnt have anybody and he wasnt allowed to come inside the hospital. There is only one name in my birth certificate and the same appears in my ID as well. I dont have a right to vote since my ID has the address of the orphanage I stayed in, she said.
A call to empower care leavers
*Natasha was left at the orphanage when she was just three weeks old. I have two brothers and a sister who were also at the orphanage. At one point my mother took me home along with my siblings, but I went through a rather traumatising experience. She beat me up and home was like hell to me. My mother didnt take care of me at all and I had to do everything by myself. After I finished my O/Ls she attempted to force me into a marriage for money, but I escaped. I wanted to return to the home, but the authorities there didnt allow me in since I was already 16. Thereafter I got myself enrolled at an institute offering a one year dental surgery course. There were many children from other homes working with me and we were all sent to Colombo. But we didnt know the whereabouts and with no money in hand we were stranded. We didnt know which bus to take and therefore walked on the streets till midnight on several occasions. We were reluctant to speak to people because they were waiting to take advantage of us. I then stayed with a relation of mine and learned to commute within Colombo. I left my family four years ago and now live alone. I was told that my birth certificate was a fake, and since there are two dates on my birth certificate and ID I still dont know my actual age or birthday. Therefore I cannot open a bank account nor vote. The homes arent interested in finding out what happens to us after we leave especially in the case of girls. People are of the view that we dont need money since we are from orphanages. The stigma we face is such that my friends have sometimes thought of taking their own lives. When I used to work I often heard the phrase mung anatha nivase ewung (they are from orphanages) and similar derogatory remarks. It would be better if the Government could implement a plan to empower care leavers as we see it as a basic right which has been taken away from us, she said.
The term anatha madama isnt accurate
*Ramya was left at an orphanage when she was eight-months-old. Her story is an example of how care leavers are stigmatised in society. After I completed my Advanced Level Exam (A/Ls) I started working at a communication centre. After sometime the owner sold it to another person and he took advantage of me. He promised to send me reloads and give money for food and transport. But after a while he demanded a huge amount of money from me. So I had to spend all my savings to cover up the debt. Likewise I have faced many challenges in life. The term anatha madama is not accurate; it is actually our home. When people realise that we dont have parents they treat us like animals. We are labelled in society and it puts us under huge stress. We dont have money in our bank accounts and because we are being treated in this way, we too look at society with anger. Therefore I make a humble request to everybody to accept us for who we are and allow us to lead a normal life like everybody else, she said.
Seeing opportunities through media

I knew how people looked at us. I went to four schools and viewed society with much hatred

*Nimmi was sent to an orphanage when she was 10-years-old. We had to wear uniform. From those days I knew how people looked at us. I went to four schools and viewed society with much hatred. I used to wonder why all this happened to me and those around me. I then had to appear in courts and even the day before my O/Ls I had a hearing. I failed my O/Ls in the first attempt and I thought I should pass. I stayed at the home for an additional year and passed the exam. Although I did A/Ls I couldnt do the subject of my choice. I wanted to study music, but I didnt get a popular school. I then wanted to study law, but then again I thought it wouldnt be the best bet for me. Thereafter I got in to writing and eventually was interested in media. I was lucky enough to do a course in journalism in India. I write a lot during my free time and I thought the media is the best way to stand up for our own rights and spread awareness about it. I stay at the Sarvodaya hostel. I cant stay at a rented place because I have no money. I like to study further, but I dont have the support nor money. When we leave the homes we dont have a right to choose the job we like. We are just put into anything that is available, so we have to continue whether we like it or not, she said.

Most IDs of care leavers give details of the orphanage

Facing pregnancy alone
Sumudu was left at an orphanage when she was two-months-old. After I did my A/Ls I was handed over to my mother, but I didnt want to go. I then did a course in nursing and it was quite challenging with night shifts etc. I later came to Colombo, but didnt have lodging. I didnt have cash to pay the boarding fees. In the meantime I contracted dengue and I didnt have anybody to look after me. Without parents we dont know how to proceed in life in certain instances. For example if a girl becomes pregnant she would need her mother by her side, but in our case we have nobody. The Government needs to have a plan for those who leave orphanages; at least a plan to reconnect them with their biological parents. To date I havent shown my birth certificate to anyone. The ID too doesnt have a permanent address and its a challenge to live with fake documents. Therefore we urge the authorities to come up with a plan for the betterment of care leavers, she said.
They are now employed at a church and are advocating for change through the Voice for Voiceless Foundation.
*The true names of the interviewees have been withheld under strict condition of anonymity
Mapping out their future
In her comments, Western Province Commissioner for Probation and Childcare Chandima Dissanayake said that once the children reach the age of 16 they are returned to their biological parents. But there are instances when we cannot send them back to their homes because there have been instances when they have been raped by family members. During such instances we send them for a training course or a job and also provide accommodation. If they like to marry we allow them to proceed with their consent. In 2017 we handed over 279 children back to their guardians and these included children under 18 as well. We have also sent 15 of them for vocational training and 38 were permanently employed. If the youth are sitting for their A/Ls after they reach 18 years, they are allowed to stay at their homes and complete the exam. We dont simply allow them to leave the orphanages because we know that they have reached an age where they are quite mischievous and stubborn, said Dissanayake.
When asked about the issue of permanent residence on IDs, she said that it depended on the way in which the form was filled. If they just include the number and the address of the place without mentioning the name of the childrens home it will not be an issue. But in the case of a child from a certified school, if he or she doesnt have parents then we have to include that the child is from a certified school. We also send the youth to do jobs depending on the court order. We also support unmarried girls and boys and give them food and accommodation and allow them to take up whatever job they like. When I took office there was no plan for care leavers in the Western Province, but Im happy to say that we have already implemented an effective plan afterwards, added Dissanayake.
Foster care system the way forward
Speaking to theDaily mirror , founder Chairman of National Child Protection Authority (NCPA), activist and legislator in child protection Professor Harendra De Silva said that institutional care isnt the best for a child. There are many different institutions including orphanages run by the private sector which are usually funded by non-governmental organisations (NGOs). In addition to that there are state-run orphanages and institutions such as certified, demand and detention homes. Children in detention homes are above five years of age whose actions have been in conflict with the law. They may be found guilty of stealing two coconuts or for jumping over a fence to a neighbouring land etc., and therefore will have to face a jail term. Some of these children have been abandoned while the others are street children. While within these institutions they have a greater tendency to experience sexual and other forms of abuse. There have been so many such incidents in the past. Theres a huge amount of emotional abuse experienced by these children which cannot even be defined. When I was NCPA Chairman each child received Rs. 21 per day for food and other expenses and orphanages and care homes relied on alms givings and other donations in kind. However there is open mismanagement of funds and resources by the staff, said Prof. De Silva.
In most instances orphanages ask for money and dry rations. But that is not what the children want. They would want a toy or a favourite food. Hence an evil system has been created. We arent trying to empower the children, but wish to enhance their self-respect. Western countries have adopted the foster care parent system which is a cheaper approach for the government as well. Here, each foster parent is given a certain amount of money to take care of the child. But the only issue here is that these foster parents should be screened because in certain instances these foster parents could be abusers or they may use children for domestic work. Hence we should establish a proper screening system for foster parents by seeking support from qualified psychologists and social workers. We are experts at showing off people who appear to be pseudo-experts and they flood the market. They appear with fake certificates and claim to be proper counsellors, warned Prof. De Silva.
Prof. De Silva further said that Sri Lanka also doesnt have a proper monitoring system. Once a child is in foster care there should be people who must monitor and evaluate the progress of the child. They should be able to go to school and monitor the performance, check for absenteeism and observe how the child is being treated at home. Foster parents may look at legal methods to adopt a child servant and such moves should be discouraged.
During a screening the childs health and nutritional status should also be monitored and evaluated. Another way of foster care is where the child lives with his or her biological parents, but another foster family could support them with money and resources. A few limitations of this process would be that it has to be handled by someone who knows the subject.
The Government doesnt have as many professionals from the perspective of administration.
They work according to regulations and circulars and therefore things dont happen as planned. We need good professionals who are committed to the subject and they should decide on the standards of procedures. We can seek support from Grama Niladhari and Samurdhi officers who could be trained to go from house to house to monitor the foster care process.
There are probation officers in the country, but they have been appointed for political purposes.
They would obey an order from the top, but will not work for the best interest of the children. In addition to that we could identify dysfunctional families and provide them with supplements. Hence there has to be a paradigm shift in the way of thinking. Theres politics everywhere, but somebody has to take a decision and this responsibility is vested upon the leadership, he opined.

Generation Never Give Up
Generation Never Give Up is a platform that has been established to empower youth leaving residential care in order to create a generation that will never give up. Therefore it aims to create a safe and inclusive society, for youth leaving residential care before or after the age of 18 with the support of state and non-state stakeholders. Services provided under this platform include job opportunities and career guidance, scholarships for higher education, psychological counselling, legal support, peer support, an emergency hotline and an information database.

CID to probe rape in Korea allegedly by three Lankans
	
The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has initiated an inquiry into an incident where three Sri Lankans, for their alleged involvement in the gang rape of an 18-year-old Korean girl in 1998 in Korea, police said.
The police headquarters in a statement said they have produced a report before the Fort Magistrates Court about the investigations.
They said the Korean Police had investigated an incident where an 18-year-old Korean girl was found dead in an expressway accident in the Daegu city in South Korea in 1998.
During the investigations, the Korean authorities have found the victims underwear from a separate location and cultivated a DNA samples using the sperms smeared in her underwear.
However, the Korean authorities had not identified the owner of the DNA but the authorities had stored the DNA samples.
In the meantime, after 12 years (in 2010), a Sri Lankan who had been employed in Korea had found guilty by a Daegu court of requesting an underaged girl for sexual favours for money.
The authorities concerned had deposited the DNA samples of the accused Sri Lankan and those DNA samples have matched with the DNA sample that had been found in the underwear of the deceased in 1998.
Korean authorities had filed a case against the suspect who was employed in the Korean Republic in the Daegu court. But, the court had rejected the case due to the fact that the time period of filing the case over a rape incident had exceeded 10 years.
According to the Korean law, the duration for filing a case regarding a rape is ten years.
However, the father of the deceased and relatives had continued to proceed with the case.
By the time, two other Sri Lankan men who had been involved in the gang rape in 2010 had departed to Sri Lanka.
The Korean government had explained the facts to Sri Lanka on August 28, 2017 in this regard and a Korean delegation had arrived in Sri Lanka on May 30, 2018 and met the Attorney General, the Ministry of Justice and the senior officers of the CID.
Later, a group of CID officers had left for Korea to hold an inquiry following the instructions of the Attorney General. The statements regarding this incident had been taken in the Sri Lanka embassy in Korea and the observations had been recorded after observing the relevant places.
The matters had been reported to the Fort Magistrates court on October 1, 2018, by the CID as it had transpired that the three suspects are in Sri Lanka at present.
This was the first time that an investigation is being done by CID with the directions of the Attorney General according to the provisions in the Clause 9 of Judicial Organizational Act. It shows that the Sri Lankan court is empowered to hear a case regarding a charge committed by a Sri Lankan outside of Sri Lanka. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Death toll from earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia jumps to 1,203
	

The death toll from an earthquake and tsunami that devastated part of the island of Sulawesi has risen to 1,203 with the total number expected to climb higher still. 
The tsunami, which was triggered after a magnitude-7.5 earthquake, ripped through the Pacific Ring of Fire and crashed into the Palu at 500mph, causing widespread destruction into the evening on Friday. 
Figures collected by the National Police Headquarters put the number killed at 1,203 people. The death toll is expected to climb even higher. Search and rescue team have struggled to reach cut-off communities feared wiped out by the disaster. 
Indonesian National Search and Rescue Agency spokesman Sutopo Nugroho said access to Donggala, as well as the towns of Sigi and Boutong, is still limited and there are no comprehensive reports from those areas. 
Government officials said rescuers could hear screams from within the rubble of several buildings on Saturday evening as they battled through the night and into Sunday to free those trapped. 
The death is believed to be still increasing since many bodies were still under the wreckage while many have not able to be reached, Nugroho said. 
Fears are mounting for the the fishing town of Donggala, which was closer to the epicenter of the quake, but which rescuers have not been able to reach. 
The town of Mamuju was also severely affected but currently impossible to access due to damaged roads and disrupted telecommunications. 
Meanwhile criticisms have been levelled at the countrys geophysics agency for lifting the tsunami warning 34 minutes after it was first issued, which may have led to confusion and exacerbated the death toll.

Tsunami sensors missed huge wave in Indonesia
Indonesia, (Daily Mail), 30 September 2018 -Indonesias geophysics agency lifted a tsunami warning just 34 minutes after it was first issued, as censors missed the warning signs for a tsunami that killed 1,203 people. 
The geophysics agency (BMKG) faced a storm of criticism on Saturday on social media, with many questioning if the tsunami warning was lifted too soon. 
The agency said it followed standard operating procedure and made the call to end the warning based on data available from the closest tidal sensor, around 200km (125 miles) from Palu. 
Officials said the death toll was likely to rise.

Don't need Army help to eliminate Awa group: Minister
	
There is no need for Army involvement in eleminating the activities of the Northern-based 'Awa' group, Law and Order Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara said and added that the Police could handle that job.
I saw the reports of the Army Commander saying they are ready to contain criminal activities in the North if the government allowed them to do so. We do not want to introduce military law into the country. I think this comments in this regard is inappropriate, he said adding that the government would not aggravate the situation.
Using the Army will send a wrong message to the world. I recently paid a visit to the North to check on the ground situation there. Actually, the 'Awa' group consists of children between the ages of 16 and 20 who have been influenced by South Indian movies. This situation prevails only in five out of 53 police divisions in the North. No killings have been reported other than incidents of assault have been reported. However, we do not approve these incidents. As subject minister I can give you a 100 per cent assurance that the Police can contain the activities of the Awa group, the minister said.
However, he said he would talk to the President and the Prime Minister to obtain the Armys support to combat drug trafficking and the underworld criminals in the country. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Govt. has no moral right to restrict imports: JVP
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today the government had no moral right to restrict the import of goods as a solution to the economic crisis while government members including the President, Prime Minister and ministers were wasting public money to import vehicles worth millions and tour the globe accompanied by large delegations.
JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake told a news conference that it was ludicrous for the government to point out that it had restricted the import of vehicles including those for MPs on duty-free permits because the MPs had already imported vehicles worth millions of rupees.
The Prime Minister has imported two vehicles worth about Rs.600 million. He even comes to parliament from Temple Trees on the helicopter. He does not even travel 60 km in these vehicles. The President has also imported two such vehicles. Ministers have also imported vehicles worth millions soon after they assumed duties as ministers. Ministers are touring the world every week or two. The President was accompanied by a 63-member delegation including relatives, staff and journalists to the UN. They spend at will, he said.
Mr. Dissanayake said suspension of permits at this juncture would not affect the MPs but it would only affect the public servants.
Some government servants had sold their old vehicles with the hope of buying new vehicles. But they have lost even the old vehicle. The government asks the people to fasten their belts while they lead luxury lives, he said and added that the measures taken by the government to alleviate the economic crisis had failed and instead had aggravated the crisis.
Mr. Dissanayake said the JVP had organized a series of protests against the governments worthless economic strategies such as increasing the price of goods, increasing tax. He said the first in the series would be held in Colombo on 23 with the help of youth, the farming community and the working people.
The recent protest held by the opposition became a drama. We hope to organize a true people's protest, he said.(Ajith Siriwardana)

Govt. refutes  media reports of railway equipment manufacturing plant
	
The Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade today categorically refuted the allegations made in the media regarding a project to set up a manufacturing plant for high powered railway equipment.
It said in a statement that a series of articles appeared in the media regarding the project and by those articles several misconceptions have been created with regards to this project.
It is necessary to point out that either the Ministers or the Ministry officials do not get involved in the approval process of investment projects. There is a standard procedure established to provide all investment approvals. The government established a comprehensive mechanism to deal with all major investment projects. It said the project was handled by BOI in a professional and transparent manner.
To this effect a high powered committee was set up in December 2016 to evaluate and approve large scale investments and fast track the approval. This committee known as Single Window Investment Approval Committee (SWIAC) is chaired by the Secretary to the Treasury and consists at present of the following senior officials:-
The Economic Advisor to the President, the Senior Advisor to the Prime Minister, the Chairman, Board of Investment of Sri Lanka, the Chairman, Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, the Technical Advisor to the Minister of Development Strategies & International Trade and one other member representing the Director Board of BOI, the statement said.
It said since 2016, the Committee has held 31 meetings where a total of 54 large scale projects have been processed and added that out of these, 26 projects have been approved, a total of 5 of these projects have been deferred due to various reasons including insufficient information provided, or issues relating to policy decisions.
The High Speed Railway Project in question is one of 5 of deferred projects as the investor had submitted incomplete information which made it not possible for SWIAC to approve this project. The current status of this project is that it is not rejected, but the investor in question needs to provide the necessary information requested by the committee so that it could be considered for approval,
The reason why the project has been deferred was because of concerns raised by the Committee regarding the past track record of the Company, technical know how,financial credibility of investors, market orientation and justification of the requirement of 4,000 acres of land for the project. In view of the above, the Committee which met on 04th August 2017 was of the view that the decision could not be taken due to lack of clarity and information.
The investor was informed to re-submit the proposal by addressing the concerns identified by the Committee, it further said.
The proposal was re-submitted by the investor on 11th October 2017. But the Committee held on 10th November 2017 ruled that approval was not possible because the investor failed to submit a comprehensive project proposal with the required information,
Accordingly the SWIAC has instructed BOI to issue a letter to the investor to submit a comprehensive report,
This is a requirement which SWIAC requests from all investors and not just this project. It is therefore important that all investors need to submit the essential details required by SWIAC to grant approval. It is on this basis that 26 projects have been already approved which include 14 manufacturing projects, 5 utility projects, 3 projects involving, Tourism, Agriculture and IT and 4 infrastructure projects, it said.

Govt. restricts only two official vehicles for ministers
	
Cabinet Ministers, State Ministers and Deputy Ministers will strictly be restricted to use only two official vehicles, the government has decided.
If a Minister uses more than two vehicles, the Secretary or the Chief Accountant of the relevant Ministry must take the responsibility of expenses for providing more than two official vehicles, the Daily Mirror learns.
Aftermath of the restriction on vehicle imports, the government has decided to put an end to the use of official vehicles given to politicians and top public officials by other members of their family which is illegal and an extra burden to the Treasury, a spokesperson of the Presidential Secretariat said yesterday.
She told Daily Mirror that President Maithripala Sirisena receives complaints from the public on a daily basis that official vehicles issued to Ministers, State Ministers, Deputy Ministers and Ministry Secretaries and heads of semi-government establishments are used by their wives, siblings and other close relatives.
The Presidential Secretariat will issue the circular shortly restricting the use of official vehicles and guidelines to be followed, she added.
These super luxury vehicles, imported on duty free permits are maintained by the respective Ministry and fuel bill and maintenance costs also borne by the Ministry or the semi-government body. Many of these super luxury cars and Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) cost between US$ 50,000 to 65,000. Therefore, the using of super luxury cars and SUVs for official use has become a burden to the Treasury. A circular is to be issued shortly outlining how official vehicles should be used and instructing to refrain from manipulating the facility, she added.
A cabinet minister is entitled to get two luxury vehicles maintained by his or her Ministry but there are instances where certain Ministers abuse the privilege and have given vehicles to all family members on the respective Ministrys expense.
Meanwhile, President Sirisena has also decided not to increase the salaries of the Ministers and MPs and he has informed party leaders.
President Sirisena will not be giving his consent to increase salaries of Parliamentarians if the proposal was submitted to the cabinet.
President Sirisena was of the view that during the past three years, the government has taken steps to increase the salaries and allowances of Ministers and Members of Parliament several times and as such he would reject any proposal to increase his salary as the President or Parliamentarians at a time the public are facing hardship.

Greeting with a bearhug and a kiss!
	
There is a zonal head in the education sector known to be a buddy of an influential politico, who has made it a habit to greet young female teachers with a bearhug and a kiss, they say.
This high-up would smooch a lady teacher and say: I hear that youre doing your work well!
The female teachers resent his conduct but are afraid to complain to higher authorities fearing a reprisal like a punishment transfer, given the political clout the man wields.
However, there is a single case reported from an area named after a lake covered with lotus flowers where a female teacher had complained to her Principal about the outrage she had to suffer, they say.

## Title: How far is the Govt responsible for the current economic malady

How far is the Govt responsible for the current economic malady  
	

Sri Lanka has a strange colonial experience of being provided with free education, health care and subsidized rice even while the country remained a colony of Britain. During the ensuing decades since independence, the countrys new leaders pushed the envelope further,much less due to a coherent long term vision, but as a populist electoral ploy. As a result, generations that grew up immediately after the independence developed a unique outlook on the role of the government as feeding and clothing them and their ever expanding legions of children. During the 60s, Sri Lanka also had a fertility rate that could rival the Sub Saharan Africas present record. However, commodity bonanza of the post-Second World War did not last longer and the plight was made worse by the mishandling of the economy.
Demographic bulge exploded in two generations of insurgencies in the South, and a good deal of the remainder were sent to the Middle East to toil for the Arabs. 
However, neither successive governments, nor people did grasp the full extent of the countrys economic maladies. The root cause was all too visible, but addressing the problem was politically uncomfortable. Successive governments opted to short term remedies that could postpone the full impact of the economic meltdown, and passed it to its successor. 
Now we are back to square one as the Rupee has plummeted to its all-time low against the dollar. However, the impact is felt more than before for the government for the first time has chosen not to seek recourse in usual short term and inevitably futile measures to prop up the falling rupee. In 2011, then Mahinda Rajapaksa regime burnt US $ 4.2 billion of foreign reserves to defend the rupee. When dollar reserves ran out, the Rupee depreciated by 13% within a year. This government, which has previously justified the lease of Hambantota port on the debt service cost of the port loan and the injection of US $ 1.2 billion by the China Port Merchant, reportedly spent US $ 1.2 billion to defend the rupee in 2015. Notwithstanding the Central Bank intervention, the rupee depreciated by 9% in that year. The current governments decision not to repeat the usual folly is much less due to its economic acumen, than due to the absence of dollar reserves. With about US $ 6 billion of debt service payments scheduled for the next year, the government is left with less than US $ 1.5 billion of foreign reserves. 
In that sense, the governments resolve to opt to the unpalatable choice and to let the market decide the value of the rupee is salutary. The other option would still have the same outcome as per the rupee, only after the Central Bank exhausts several billions of dollars, and potentially creates conditions for a loan default. Also, the foreign exchange crisis is not uniquely Sri Lankan. Nor are its immediate causes domestic. From already crisis-ridden Latin American economies to otherwise sound Indian and Chinese economies, native currencies have depreciated against a stronger Dollar.
However, three years is long enough time for the government to address the root causes of its balance of payment problem. That root cause is the lack of exports that brings in dollars. The governments policymakers have kept repeating the virtues of an export- oriented economy. They are right in their economic conviction. But, there is a major difference between aspiring for things, and strategizing and implementing means to achieve those ends. In that sense, this government has seminally failed to implement its economic vision, only if it has one. 
There are two ways to interpret that failure. One is at the extreme end of liberal market economics, this government should be thinking that everything will be determined by the market forces. So that as the rupee depreciates further, exports become completive and hence, the export income increases. At the same time, imports become expensive, and curtailed by low local demand, hence the trade deficit gets plugged in. However, as the recent history of political economy would attest the economic theory has not taken a life of its own, much less so in the developing world, without calculated government interventions.

Economic liberalism itself causes a good deal of physical and psychological displacement , social upheaval and short term pain
The second conjecture is that irrespective of what it thinks and what it wants to achieve, this government is ineffective, bereft of cohesion, and increasingly so, political capital. That turns the government into a mere passenger of the vehicle it was meant to steer. My guess is that the second is a better reflection of the government policy.
Consider the following. While clamouring for an export- driven economy, this government undermined even the already secured foreign direct investment, be it the Colombo Port City or the proposed infrastructure development projects. Suspension of these projects was reflected in the lower economic growth numbers of the previous years. Policy uncertainty of the government has further discouraged investment since then.
Second, it lacks the political capital and decisiveness to implement crucial economic policy reforms and development projects. Even though the government may enter into several Free Trade Agreements, we are still left with nothing to export. Its proposed economic zones, probably the most transformative one being in Hambantota, are trapped in a policy vacuum. You need a government with political will and assertiveness to acquire land and reform labour laws. Vacillating in these measures has only contributed to the current fiscal woes of the government.
Third, despite its self- professed commitment to free market, which by extension should favour competency over nepotism, this government has acted not differently from its predecessors. Managing loss- making state- owned- enterprises, Srilankan Airlines being one of the biggest drain of public coffers, would have been done better under a nonpolitical board of directors, hired through an international recruitment process. Instead, the government has stuck to its cronies.
So, effectively three years has been squandered, and it is unlikely that nothing much would happen in the remainder of the current term of the government.
And fourth, there is another, unpalatable reality of the conditions that underpinned the success of economic liberalism, especially in the developing world:Economic liberalism is best served with political authoritarianism. That is the stubborn reality from Augusto Pinochets Chile to development dictatorships of East Asia, Malaysia, Singapore, and the present day China.
There is logic to it. Economic liberalism itself causes a good deal of physical and psychological displacement , social upheaval and short term pain. Only a government that can ignore short term public grievances, and cohesive and single minded enough to forge ahead with its policy can prevail over a plethora of vested, and often competing social impulses. However, means and mode of political authoritarianism have also moderated over time, from Chiang Kai-sheks white terror to a more subtle power centralized approaches of Dr. Mahathir Mohamed and Lee Kuan Yew.
The bottom line however, is in the developing world, the leaders have to choose between being a political liberal and an economic liberal. Trying to become both would lead to being neither.
This governments desire to present itself as the one that restored democracy is in conflict with what is demanded from it to truly leapfrog the economy. For that, its apologists could even project the governments spinelessness as virtuous. However, running a country is lot more than being sanctimonious. It entails dispassionate policy making and implementation. There however, this government is at fault for lacking it.

Indonesia tsunami: Death toll rises to over 1,200
	
The number of people known to have died in Indonesia in Friday's earthquake and tsunami has risen to more than 1,200, the country's disaster response agency says.
The death toll jumped on Tuesday from a previous confirmed figure of 844.
The 7.5-magnitude quake struck just off the central island of Sulawesi, setting off a tsunami that hit the coastal city of Palu.
People there are growing increasingly desperate for food, fuel and water.
There are fears some survivors may still be trapped under the rubble of buildings.
Indonesian Red Cross officials have told the BBC that 34 Indonesian students whose bodies were found under a church buried by a mudslide were among those killed.
They were among a group of 86 students reported missing from a Bible camp in the Jonooge Church Training Centre. The whereabouts of the other 52 students are not known. (BBC)

Is Colombo becoming an unsustainable city  
	
Even if I knew that tomorrow the world would go to pieces, I would still plant my apple tree Martin Luther King
If taken either literally or metaphorically Kings quote has a lesson for all. Here in Colombo as the skyline changes every passing day with bare tall buildings dwarfing the shorter, old ones the pertinent questions one would ask are where is the replenishment for the trees felled. Where are the green lanes and space for ecological balance Have the government, local bodies and the private sector forgotten the green factor
Similar building booms with scant regard for ecology and essential facilities saw cities like Rio de Janeiro, Manila and Mexico City, turning the most unsustainable metropolises on earth. One wonders whether Colombo is fast following them. After all just like Colombo both Rio and Manila are sea front cities.
Anyone travelling to Colombo from Kandy, Negombo, Avissawella, Horana or Kalutara will pay witness to the phenomenon of every peripheral city in the province merging the other thus turning the entire western province into one big city. There are only a handful of villages left in between the townships and green patches and tree lines are fast becoming a rarity. The paddy fields and rubber lands have been taken over by the real estate companies. Call this urbanization or development but who decides what is suitable or not or the balance between development and ecology
Vihara Maha Devi Park (Victoria Park) which was opened in 1951 remains the only major green patch in Colombo district and no plans have been made to open any other large park ever since. If at all if theres any shade other than that its provided by the old tree lines in Colombo 7 which too date back to the same era.
As for sanitary facilities, sewerage issue in Colombo and suburbs has reached a crisis point and with a chunk of new buildings hiring sewerage bowsers to empty pits regularly in the absence of their own treatment plants. As of now all the sewerage lines of Colombo National Hospital are open to Beira Lake and the plush new city of Colombo Fort is being built around this lake of epidemics.

Meanwhile, despite repeated requests no major repairs have been done at Ambatale water plant and already the city is having issues with the water supply. As to how to cater to the rapidly increasing water demand in the next few years is anyones guess. Besides deep earth drilling for high rising buildings has gone to block underground waterways and home wells are fast becoming a thing of the past.
Its true that decades of poor planning has left little space for manoeuvring for the incumbent government. However still its obvious that unless all government agencies attending to infrastructure, amenities and facilities meet and have a brainstorming session and work together to address the crisis the situation is only going to turn for the worse. Right now what is happening is each government agency working independently is sometimes even at cross purposes and overlapping of duties.
As for making Colombo a greener city given the manner desert cities like Dubai have resorted to innovative moves to increase the greenery its not wrong to say one can do wonders with the fertile soil of Sri Lanka if the government and private sector are genuinely committed to the cause. Given the number of government ministries and private entities involved in the building boom it is obvious that unless theres a move by the political leadership it will be difficult to muster unanimity to make Colomboa greener city.
The only redeeming factor in the city perhaps is its relatively high standard of the air quality. According to a Yale university study the mandatory emission test introduced in 2008 by then Environment Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka has resulted in Sri Lanka performing way ahead of other nations in the region in terms of air quality.
Progressive, wholesome steps yield good results. Sri Lanka surely has to find a way out of the current mess before its too late.

Jaffna Cinema Festival - No show for 'Demons in Paradise
	
The internationally renowned film Demons in Paradise which was competed at the prestigious Cannes Film festival in France has been removed from being screened at the International Jaffna Cinema Festival starting this weekend, its Director Jude Ratnam said.
Issuing media release, he said the festival organizers of the Jaffna International Cinema Festival had decided to remove the film directed by him from its scheduled programme allegedly over pressure from a group known only as the 'Community' in Jaffna.
I have not yet been given a proper explanation for the removal of my film from the festival schedule. I feel this is a case of censorship and an infringement on the fundamental rights to freedom of expression, Ratnam said. My film was invited by the Jaffna International Cinema Festival this year and the screening was scheduled for October 5, 2018 at 6. 45 pm at the Majestic Cineplex Jaffna. I had provided the film to the festival with the required technical standards, press material and with the copy of the Public Performance Board Certificate (U -All Audience).
Demons in Paradise, a mostly biographical film, unearths the grisly bitter truth about Sri Lankas war from the point of view of an insider. With actual facts, real life incidents and original people involved in the conflict, the film was nominated for two awards Golden Camera and Golden Eye at the Cannes last year.
Meanwhile, issuing a counter statement referring to the statement by Jude Ratnam, Jaffna International Cinema Festival Director Anoma Rajakaruna said Jude Ratnams film which was premiered on May 24, 2017 had been travelling to many international film festivals abroad and had many screenings in the South of Sri Lanka and added he did not take his the film in the North particularly in the Jaffna peninsula for a public screening.
In his statement Jude mentions that, Thus far I have not been given a proper explanation for the removal of my film DEMONS IN PARADISE from the festival schedule which is not accurate, Anoma said in her statement.
Jude Ratnams film came to the festival through a partner of the festival who has presented his film at other locations in the South. The organizing committee has explained to the partner organization about their decision which was then relayed to Ratnam. Subsequently, the partner went into discussion with Ratnam about starting a dialogue about the removal and overall freedom of expression, she explained.
We have kept the slot allocated for Jude Ratnams film on the schedule open. We would have started a discussion on the freedom of expression. It is sad that Jude Ratnam chose to walk out of the discussion to issue a press statement in the South of the country without considering our offer or the implications. If the intended discussion took place, it would have opened up a space not just for the screening of one film, but for many other screenings of other film makers as well, in a nation divided by identity politics, Anoma added.

A provincial purohita who was appointed to act for the Chief for mere seven days reportedly celebrated the event with a noisy street parade.
The seven-day chief and his jubilant sidekicks had paraded the streets hooraying and singing to much amusement and derisive humour of the onlookers and had later gone around the estate sector, where some crowds had greeted the politico with a rousing ovation.
This politico had been sworn in as the acting chief for seven days in an unusual situation where two of the four purohitas of this council had gone abroad and he had looked on this acting appointment as a godsend and a cause for a grand celebration, they say.

Jumbo-sized delegation to UN raises eyebrows
	

The jumbo-sized delegation that has been accompanying the countrys Number One on his yearly visit to New York to attend the UNGA annual general sessions has been a hot topic from the days of the previous regime.

Therefore, it is no wonder that the current incumbents recent visit to New York to attend the 73rd UNGA sessions as well has become the main topic in political circles and in the public domain once again for the size of this delegation too is obviously big enough to be called jumbo!
Besides, there is an oft-repeated allegation that the countrys annual visit to New York to attend the UNGA sessions has been exploited by powers that be as an occasion to offer an all-expenses-paid- vacation for a select few including the family members of the political elite.
Several pertinent questions were asked about the composition of the 63-member delegation which accompanied No.1. One is that the top team member handling foreign affairs could have been in the delegation instead of taking four others with him on this visit.

Land fragmentation and its fallout Plantations on chopping block  
	
Moves are afoot to replace the Land Reform Act of 1972 with a new Act that would release State lands to the open market
In a Cabinet decision mentioned at a weekly media briefing on December 12 last year, among 35 decisions announced was a proposal that was part of a process that would radically transform the land use patterns on Sri Lankas plantations.
Under the innocuous-sounding heading Improvement of performance of state plantation companies the Ministry of Public Enterprise Development, then under Minister Kabir Hashim, introduced proposals that would lead to the closure of 38 estates in the Kandy, Matale and Nuwara Eliya districts.
Land and workers rights activists familiar with the developments say these lands are to be fragmented and offered to private investors for a variety of non-plantation projects such as tourism under PPPs (public-private partnerships).
Among them is Loolkandura Estate (Loolecondera to the Scots)  Sri Lankas first tea estate started in 1867 by Scottish Planter James Taylor, whose picture adorns many tea packs designed for the tourist market.
For the most part, the long-term impact of these changes on the plantations, estate workers and the environment have been obscured to the public eye.
Isolated reports on the PPPs, measures to attract private investors etc., fail to convey the radical nature of changes underway in this restructuring activity. It should be a matter of concern that there has been little transparency on the part of authorities regarding this process, which is in line with IMF and World Bank conditions to which the Government is committed.
Workers were unaware till recently, said Buddhi Jayasuriya, Chairman of the LSSPs Agricultural Committee.
The Cabinet paper says it was discussed with the trade unions, but workers are in the dark. (It was only) when certain investors visited the estates to get information that they (the workers) discovered it. This was very secretly done.
Workers from Loolkandura which comes under the Janatha Estates Development Board (JEDB), and from surrounding estates are gathering signatures on a petition to President Maithripala Sirisena demanding a stop to the process that would result in a closure of factories and loss of jobs. About 2,000 have already signed according to Jayasuriya.
With 400 to 500 workers on each estate, several thousands would be affected, he said. The acreage of the targeted estates in the three districts is around 30,000 in his estimation.
He noted that in 1995 when the Government divested shares of the state-owned plantations to the private sector, the entire estates were given, unlike in the process now underway where the estates are being fragmented, with no hope of revival. The whole idea in giving them to Public Enterprise (ministry) is to fragmentise, the former general manager of the Sri Lanka State Plantations Corporations (SLSPC) and deputy general manager of JEDB said.

The Cabinet paper says it was discussed with the trade unions, but workers are in the dark. (It was only) when certain investors visited the estates to get information that they (the workers) discovered it. This was very secretly done
In a parallel development, the Government has been building houses on seven perches of land each granted to estate workers, along with title deeds. It would appear this is being done to improve the lives of workers who till now lived in the sub-standard conditions of line-rooms. While there is no denying that the housing conditions of plantation workers were in dire need of upgrading, what the project proponents do not say is, that along with the closure of factories and redistribution of land for private business, a situation could be created where workers have houses but no jobs.
They might be taken as casual workers  depending on the whim of the employer Jayasuriya speculates, but worries that they will lose community and the collective power of the trade unions. Analysts say the governments long-term objective in granting freehold land titles is to create assets that can potentially enter the land market, in line with World Bank-driven policy. This could eventually lead to dispossession.
In August last year the Government approved amending the law relating to fragmentation of Tea, Rubber and Coconut plantations, with reports saying the intention was to enable the use of such lands for large scale development projects.
It is not only the plantations but also other smallholders agricultural lands that are in the balance under the governments neo-liberal agenda. Most farmers cultivate small two or three acre plots of state land on some form of lease or permit. The governments programme of granting title deeds to these lands has been going on apace, and here again, the policy is guided by the World Banks thinking that resources like land and water should be treated as traded commodities, and thrown open to market forces. This would make way for investors to consolidate holdings and start large-scale projects. Its well known that farmers are chronically indebted.
The small-holders, who are pushed off their land - either because they are forced to sell or because lands given as collateral for loans are seized -will, in all likelihood, be driven into the cities where they would form a pool of cheap labour.
The poor performance of the state owned plantations was the reason cited by minister Hashim at the time he introduced the Cabinet proposal.
For decades Governments have been trying to dispose of unproductive estates Jayasuriya observed.
The question that arises is whether divesting state ownership and fragmenting the lands for private investors is the best route to take with these precious natural resources.
Fragile and sensitive eco-systems of the mid-country plantation areas are at risk, environmentalists argue. The JEDB and SLSPC hold large extents of land that are forests. The destruction resulting from clearing them for various business enterprises will cause significant environmental degradation, they warn.
A large percentage of some of these estates consist of primary forests, not secondary forests, said Sajeewa Chamikara, Environment Consultant at MONLAR (Movement for National Land and Agricultural Reform).
Natural habitats will be affected, water catchment areas will be affected, he told the Daily Mirror.
In the Knuckles, Sri Pada, Rakwana and surrounding areas biodiversity will be affected. In low country tea-growing areas, secondary forests support streams and catchment areas he noted. Chamikara warns of moves afoot to replace the Land Reform Act of 1972 with a new Land Bank Act that would release state lands to the open market.
At the behest of the World Bank, thousands of acres currently under the Land Reform Commission is to be made available to private investors including foreigners he says, in a MONLAR paper calling for an immediate halt to these reforms.
Laws have already been amended to lift restrictions on foreigners access to land. These policies will rob people, and especially small farmers, of the right to land and natural resources for their livelihood he says.
Although the upcoming budget looks set to deliver assorted relief (Sahana) to the people, it seems unlikely that the Government will compromise on its radical policy direction relating to land.
It is too entrapped in conditionality imposed by its external advisors to allow such an assertion of sovereignty, it would seem.

Macedonias bid to join EU, NATO in limbo after vote
	

REUTERS, 01st OCTOBER, 2018- Macedonias hopes of joining the European Union and NATO were in limbo on Monday, a day after voters backed a plan to change the countrys name by a large margin but failed to hit the 50 percent turnout required for the referendum result to be valid.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev said he would press on regardless with a vote in parliament to endorse the change of name to the Republic of North Macedonia but the defence minister said an early election might now prove necessary, potentially derailing the whole plan due to a tight timeframe.
Some 91 percent of voters backed the name change, demanded by neighboring Greece as a precondition for it lifting its veto on Macedonia joining the EU and NATO. But turnout was just 36.9 percent, final figures showed, far below the required threshold.

Gandhi Jayanti - Today, October 2 is Mahathma Gandhisbirth anniversary

The very first set of stamps on Mahatma Gandhi was brought out in India in 1948. Anil Dhir, in his book Famous Stamps - The Romance of Rarities writes about the stamp issue right from the concept, in 1947, of having a set of stamps on Gandhi to be released to commemorate his 80th birthday, on October 2, 1949

A celebrated icon on postage stamps, Mahatma Gandhi is someone nations the world over turn to for inspiration. Mahatma Gandhis steadfast belief in, and practice of, non-violence and peace has been a source of inspiration around the world. He is of course the father of the Indian nation, but his is a global iconic status. Countries around the world have naturally turned to the great apostle of ahimsa (non-violence), whether they were fighting for freedom from colonialism or seeking to establish human rights and peace. The United Nations has also declared his birthday, October 2, as the International Day of Non-Violence. Gandhi has been honoured by countries around the world on their stamps depicting diverse aspects of his life, work and philosophy, making him perhaps the personality most featured globally on postal stationery.
The very first set of stamps on Mahatma Gandhi was brought out in India in 1948. Anil Dhir, in his book Famous Stamps - The Romance of Rarities writes about the stamp issue right from the concept, in 1947, of having a set of stamps on Gandhi to be released to commemorate his 80th birthday, on October 2, 1949. However, the great leader was assassinated on January 30, 1948, and the set of stamps released on August 15, 1948, marking Indias first anniversary of independence. The stamps were printed in Switzerland rather than in India! Some of the stamps were then Service overprinted back home in India for Governor General C. Rajagopalacharis official correspondence. Then in 1969, the birth centenary of Gandhi was commemorated by India by issuing four stamps. Gandhi and his wife Kasturba, affectionately addressed as Bapu and Ba, were shown on the Ba-Bapu stamp.
South Africa was crucial to Gandhis Satyagraha (insistence on truth), and in 1995 a joint stamp issue of India and South Africa was released. The stamps show the young lawyer Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and the elderly Mahatma. The illustrations on the miniature sheet show Gandhi spinning the charkha and at historic Dandi, as also his belongings such as a timepiece, spectacles and slippers that portray his frugality and simplicity. The Centenary of Satyagraha also saw India Post bringing out four stamps in 2007 depicting events from Gandhis life in South Africa. As the leading light of the freedom struggle in India, Gandhi served as the President of the Indian National Congress in 1924. And he is shown on the stamps released by India in 1985 marking the partys centenary. The other noteworthy stamps have been themed on Salt Satyagraha, Dandi March and Quit India Movement. A celebrated stamp was released in the millenniums first year based on Gandhis caricature by well-known cartoonist Ranga that interestingly also bears semblance to the outline map of India! And Mahatma Gandhi Man of the Millennium was the theme of the stamps issued the next year.
The charkha as the symbol of non-violence is a leitmotif on the stamps on Gandhi. And in 2011, India Post released the worlds first khadi stamp. The unique diamond-shaped Z100-denomination stamp shows Gandhis face in profile and the charkha on khadi cloth with his words, Be true.
Besides stamps, Gandhi has been featured on India Posts pre-paid postal stationery such as inland letter cards, postcards and envelopes. There are also permanent cancellations issued from post offices in Gujarat showing the Alfred High School, where Gandhi did his schooling, his ancestral home and Kocharab Satyagraha Ashram. A unique special cover with a hologram showing Gandhi was also brought out by the South India Philatelists Association, with the postal departments approval. Globally, stamps and postal stationery on Gandhi have been released by more than 90 countries. The United States of America, Mauritius, Fiji, Switzerland, Guyana, Poland, Bhutan, Myanmar, Mexico, Iran, Ireland and the former USSR are only some of the countries. An error occurred when Trinidad and Tobago brought out a stamp in the year 1970 instead of 1969 to mark the leaders centenary! Britain, despite having the tradition of not issuing a stamp on a non-British personality, issued a Gandhi stamp in 1969.
The United Nations too brought out a stamp on Gandhi in 2009 designed by Miami-based artist Dr. Ferdie Pacheco. Dr. Pacheco reveals that the colours in the stamp depict what Gandhi epitomised: I chose these colours: red because it is the colour of energy, his energy even when he was fasting, green the colour of healing, white of purity, blue of serenity, yellow of balance and brown of the earth as he helped people here on earth. All of these colours represent a peaceful man who helped the world. Indeed, a true representation of the Mahatma in the miniature art piece that a stamp is.

Middle period Premaratne: From   Parithyagaya  to Visidela  
	

The films of H.D. Premaratne present an interesting conundrum: how does the social cohabit with the personal in a work of art Particularly, it can be added, in a country where the social has transcended the personal since the seventies The movies have always tackled critics over this debate. Premaratnes films are even more interesting here in that the debate in them takes on a new dimension: is there box office potential in presenting, or representing, the social alongside the personal As I implied in my article on Vasantha Obeyesekere last week, this can best be answered or resolved by looking at the evolution of the director through various career phases.
In Premaratnes case, there were three phases. The first began with Sikuruliya and ended with Apeksha: a space of two films. The third, his last, began with Mandakini and ended with his finale, Kinihiriya Mal: again, a space of two films. Between these two there was his Middle Period, a total of 11 films: Parithyagaya, Deveni Gamana, Adara Hasuna, Mangala Thagga, Saharawe Sihinaya, Palama Yata, Kulageya, Uda Sulanga, Saptha Kanya, Seilama, Visidela. I wish here to examine these 11 works, because in them we see the evolution of the film director from an artiste committed to the cinema as a populist and at the same time middle of the road art to one who had to grapple with a polity that could no longer ignore the political potential of the medium.

Premaratnes films are even more interesting here in that the debate in them takes on a new dimension: is there box office potential in presenting, or representing, the social alongside the personal
H.D. Premaratne was not an artiste who divorced the social from the personal even in his first two movies. Apeksha was in that regard a felt, sincere work of art, and in the rift between its two heroes, the poor boy and the rich heiress, we saw a comment, no matter how subtle or offhanded it may have been, on the backdrop it was set against, amidst the JVP insurrection and the problems of youth unemployment.
When Nimal passes off as Samson, the boyfriend to Niranjala, we discern a clash of social class realities underscored by a fairy tale motif: the peasant who, for an instant at least, becomes a prince who wins his princess: a male Cinderella. It is not difficult to discern a variation on this motif even in Sikuruliya, particularly in the parable-like transformation of the protagonist, from a delicate village lass to a hardy urban woman. This refraction, if you can put it that way, of class realities through fantasy was a theme that distinguished the early Premaratne from his contemporaries.
Parithyagaya took from where Apeksha left, with the same leading actor but with a different, more specific theme: not class rifts per se, but the issue of dowries among the village peasantry. In here, I notice a similarity with Obeyesekeres Palagetiyo in how the director views the rich and the poor, on (almost) equally sympathetic terms. The iskole mahaththayas family, for instance, are not presented as greedy landowners who refuse to let the man marry the girl of his dreams unless her family scrounges up a decent dowry, and the girls family are not represented as innocents either, though they are certainly more worthy of empathy than them. When the iskole mahaththaya (Tony Ranasinghe) tells the protagonist, the girls brother (Amarasiri Kalansuriya), that while he loves her, he understands at the same time the feelings of his relations because of how they suffered to raise him as a child, we come across class relations more complicated than the fairy tale undertones of Sikuruliya and Apeksha.
Deveni Gamana and Adara Hasuna were works which immediately predated the second JVP insurrection. They are more personal than Parithyagaya, yet they try with searing honesty to depict the ways in which certain realities grapple with the dreams, the hopes, and the longings of individuals.
Deveni Gamana is about the theme of virginity, which is what elevates it to the plane of both the social and the personal: the social, because it represents the clash between tradition and modernity, and represents how modernity itself can be used to sustain the old order (an example: the mother of the protagonist, played by Irangani Serasinghe, trying to get legal backing for a separation between him and his lover, only to be told by his brother, played by Ravindra Randeniya, that the law cant be used to meddle into and interfere with his life); and the personal, because it depicts, in an arduous way (the plot takes forever to resolve itself), the triumph of love over everything else. It is in the final sequence, set in slow motion, of the two lovers embracing one another, that the commercial tendencies of the plot takes over.
The plot of Adara Hasuna (a variation on the Little Mermaid motif, with the cast aside princess who meets the prince of her dreams), which was like Deveni Gamana a box office hit, is in that sense more convoluted, a return to the Premaratne of the Apeksha years, and for that reason, it cant be seen as a prelude to the insurrection years. But Mangala Thagga, which its theme of murder, suspicion, and betrayal, Palama Yata, with its indictment on the cycle of poverty, and Saptha Kanya, with its theme of young love set against the Colombo mafia, depicted darker, stranger milieus.
In these films, Premaratne tries to come to terms with himself, and perhaps for that reason, there are spontaneous outbursts, which try to relate their saccharine-coated plotlines to the societies in which they are set. Its a rift he tried to bridge, and to a considerable extent did bridge, in Seilama and Visidela.
Seilama is as political as Siri Medura, also scripted by Simon Nawagaththegama, which is to say that it is political to the extent that one sees. There are those familiar tropes from Nawagaththegama: the abstruse sexual encounter (in a forest, between the farmer and his wife), the beedi-smoking hunter, the intrusion on the village world by the city (Seilama is another word for town), the resultant clash between the one and the other, and the rape, both literal and metaphoric, by the one of the other. The erotic streak that cuts across the film is fascinating and repelling, and there are times, as with the rape of the woman (Anoja Weerasinghe), when the inexplicable takes over the real, and when reality gets bogged down.

Premaratnes overarching motif in nearly all his films, whatever the themes they took on, was that of female agency and individuality
Nawagaththegama wrote and Premaratne directed Seilama when the former was at the height of his career (as a scriptwriter). It was also around the time of the publication of his Sansaranyaye cycle of novels. The intermingling of the mystical with the carnal is for this reason poignant, and in the end, when the woman gets carted off by a bunch of city folk, and the protagonist (Ravindra Randeniya) collapses in a heap of despair at what she has done, the social content of the plot comes out quite vividly. In Seilama, moreover, the political does not mix freely with the personal. It comes out slowly but surely, and in both worlds - village and city - the personal is shown as dependent on the political, be it the relationship between the farmers family and their overlord, or the relationship between the lorry driving protagonist and his superiors.
Premaratnes overarching motif in nearly all his films, whatever the themes they took on, was that of female agency and individuality. They may be submissive (Sujatha in Deveni Gamana) and they may be quiet but assertive (Deepthi in Saptha Kanya) and they may be harsh and uncharacteristically hostile, only to realise the folly of their anger later on (the woman in Seilama). Because of this, the political and the social content of the plots of these films comes out from and is reflected in the plight of its female protagonists, from Sikuruliya to Kinihiriya Mal. Premaratnes films were at their weakest, again because of this, when those protagonists were not properly defined, or when the directors characterisation of them was weak.
This was what undid Visidela. While visually lovely, while reeking of the political in its depiction of the intrusion of the city in the form of both the JVP insurrectionists and the police, it seemed to me a confused mess, a point I highlighted in my article on Premaratne in this paper last year.
There is nothing substantive to connect the decision of the protagonist to join the police with the rape of the village, metaphoric and literal (that is, the rape of the heros sister by her uncle), apart from the contrived entry of the heros colleagues (who end up shooting him) at the end.
The personal and the social do not, for this reason, cohabit as sleekly as they did in a work like Seilama (which was anyway not a political film), and part of that reason, in fact one of the main reasons I can point out for it, was the way Anosha Sonali played her part. Certainly no village damsel the way that Swineetha Weerasinghe was in Sikuruliya, Anosha jolted me the first time I saw Visidela. The same could have been said, incidentally, of Sangeetha Weerarathnes performance in Kinihiriya Mal, a film which deserves a more extensive treatment in this paper, at another time.
In the end, Premaratnes films, whether on the social or personal plane, depended on his actress. If she gave in, the entire film, as Visidela proved, would give in too.

Some 700 air fresheners have reportedly been purchased for use inside the main council which moved into a brand-new building complex recently.
These air fresheners costing Rs. 16,000 each have to be refilled at least twice a month and one refill would cost Rs. 6,000.
Even the offices of top authorities in the country do not use air fresheners considering it an unnecessary expenditure item, they say.
Employees of the council would often make the wisecrack, Our Lokka, a jolly good fellow, is never stingy with taxpayers money!

'Only 80%' certainty over body of Briton died in SL
	
The family of a British national, who died while swimming in Sri Lanka, had been told by experts that there was only 80% certainty of the identity of his body because his post-mortem examination had been carried out in haste.
According to BBC, the 60-year-old Suffolk businessmanJohn Simsdied after he went into the sea in Tangalle at about 10 P.M. on January 12, 2013.
The inquest into the businessman's death heard his body was identified from a passport photo and no post-mortem examinations mentioned a presence of metal in his body.
The inquest in Ipswich heard Mr Sims, who had businesses registered in Creeting St Peter, Suffolk, had been in Sri Lanka for almost a month before he died.
It was heard that he had gone for a swim after dinner and his companion raised the alarm when he had not returned after 20 or 30 minutes.
Sri Lankan authorities found his body in the early hours the next morning.
It was heard tests revealed the father of five had previously suffered a heart attack, which his family disputed.
In a report, a dental specialist said the likelihood the body found was his was "at least 80%".
The family, who were at the inquest, said Mr Sims' body was "covered in scars" but there was no mention of them in the report from Sri Lanka nor after his body had been returned to Suffolk.
They said they informed specialists he had a titanium structure in his back and had undergone a hip replacement, but these were not mentioned in any report, it was heard.
Additionally, the height given for Mr Sims was incorrect, according to the family, who dispute the body was that of Mr Sims.
Assistant coroner Dan Sharpstone said there were "a lot of holes in this case" and described the Sri Lankan post-mortem examination as "cursory".

Over 75% ministers secretaries are family members: Union
	
More than 75 per cent of Central Government Ministers and Provincial Council Ministers had appointed their family members as their Secretaries, the Ministers Secretaries Union said.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Union General Secretary Ajith Jayasundera said that as a result there was no one there to instruct most of the Ministers, Deputy Ministers, State Ministers and Provincial Council Ministers to develop the country with new thoughts.
Mr Jayasundera said that their association would submit a proposal to the President, Prime Minister and all the political party leaders to enforce the 1994 circular issued by Presidential Secretary preventing appointment of family members as Secretaries or Personal Assistants.
He said that when the circular was issued in 1994 it did not enforced continually.
When the rupee is depreciating the Ministers are acting without any sense of how people are suffering. This is due to lack of accurate information available to Ministers as their Secretaries are their own family members or relatives, he added. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Parties that were together at 2015 Presidential Polls  should forge ahead Sumanthiran
	
There is consensus on power devolution at Steering Committee
	Three tier of governance proposed
	We still have hope on constitution making process
	Once the elections come, we will sit together and decide on our teams
	We never discussed the 13th Amendment

Jaffna district Tamil National Alliance (TNA) parliamentarian M. A. Sumanthiran in an interview with Daily mirror , speaks about the current status of the Constitution-making process and future politics. He shared the following:
Q How do you look at the current status of politics
Well, there was a change in 2015. There were a lot of expectations. Initially, though the 100-day programme did not finish in 100 days, there were significant achievements - the enactment of the 19th Amendment and the Right to Information Act. After the parliamentary elections, the two main parties got together to solve the national issues. The constitution making process was undertaken. All those were great achievements. Now looking back, those first year gains were not properly consolidated in the next two years.
Coalition politics has not been successful all the time. Things changed quite a bit after the results of the local government elections. People have lost faith that whether the government would do all those reforms that were promised, primarily the new constitution.
The abolition of executive presidency and solving the national question were the major changes that were expected. Although the Constitution making process moves forward, it is floundering. A draft will be presented. But, the phase has slowed down drastically losing hope that it will never happen. We still have hope. There is another year also for the present government. We think this government can redeem itself if it sits down to do all the reforms it promised. We will support it in order to achieve all those objectives.
Q How certain are you that this constitution making process will become a success
Well, I cannot speculate the degree of certainty in this regard. There is sufficient consensus that was struck at the Steering Committee deliberations. A draft will come out. If the political parties take the stand that they took at the Steering Committee, we will have the large support for it.
Q What are the areas agreed upon
There is no disagreement on devolution principles. That is one area where, I would say, almost all the members representing the committee agreed. In regard to the abolition of executive presidency, at a particular stage, all agreed except one or two small parties. Subsequently, there has been divergence there. Even the electoral reforms, there was a point that all agreed. That is the 60-40 ratio on the Multi Member Constituency model.
Q As far as devolution is concerned, do you think that there is agreement between the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP)
Yes, there is agreement on the content. There was no disagreement.

With the experience we have in regards to the local councils, we have doubt whether the 50-50 ratio for provincial councils will be good at all
Q Is it to devolve power based upon the 13th Amendment
We never discussed the 13th Amendment. It is a new constitution on the basis of developing power to the province. Even on the details, there was no disagreement.
Q What are the contours of devolution you agreed upon
The contours are that the provinces will have their areas of power. That is to have legislative and executive powers. We agreed on a three tier system. The local councils will also be empowered as the third tier of governance. They will not have legislative power, but executive powers. We agreed that even though the centre can have legislative powers, it can be given to execution by the provincial councils or the local councils. Even the provincial councils can give some executive powers to the local authorities.
The principle of subsidiary was accepted. What can be done at the lowest level should be done at the lowest. What cannot be done at that level should be given to the next higher level. That was agreed without any dissent. Then, there is a proposal to have a Second Chamber with provincial representatives. It is something that can act like a safeguard for devolution. As for the national policies, the provincial participation in national policy formulation in the province concerned is ensured.
Q In the meantime, the JVP has presented the 20th Amendment to the Constitution. What do you think about it
The JVPs position is that executive presidency should be abolished. They say it is impossible to enact a new Constitution. Therefore, they want to get the abolition of executive presidency done. At one point during the deliberations of the Steering Committee, there was consensus in this regard.
Q What is the TNAs position in this regard
The TNA supports the abolition of executive presidency. We would like that to happen in the new Constitution instead of doing it in a piecemeal manner like this. Since our position is that we support the abolition of executive presidency, we will have to support it if it comes up.
Q Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran is making direct allegations against you. He is from your party Are you willing to respond
I do not intend to respond to him because his term will be over in a months time. Thereafter, we will have to wait for the provincial council elections. In the east, we have not had elections for a year now. We will force the government to hold elections as early as possible. Once the elections come, we will sit together and decide on our teams.
Q Does it mean that you will not re-nominate him as your partys chief ministerial candidate
We have not taken any official decision in regard to that. My position is that he cannot be re-nominated. I spoke to the majority of party members. One basic reason is that he has campaigned against his own party at the last parliamentary and local government elections. That itself disqualifies him.
Q Who did he support to
He did not support anybody openly. But, he issued statements clearly indicating that he did not support us.
Q The government was able to postpone these elections using piece of legislation enacted with the support of your party. In retrospect, do you regret your decision
Not really. That was done because we had come to an agreement in regard to the system of elections to Parliament - the MMC. The same system is to be introduced for local governments and provincial councils.With the experience we have in regards to the local councils, we have doubt whether the 50-50 ratio for provincial councils will be good at all.  
Q The two- year period envisaged in the UNHRC resolution to implement its recommendations will lapse in March, next year. How do you look at the process so far
The government delay that report. The report came out in September, 2015. A consensual resolution was adopted on October 1, 2015. Similarly, one and half years time was given. When that time lapsed in 2017, the government sought further time. That was granted until March, 2019. We find that most of the matters have not been implemented yet. The government has not commenced work even on the matters that have been touched upon. It is up to the UNHRCs decision.
Q How do you find the international scenario in this regard, especially in the context of the US no longer being there
In 2012 and 2013, Sri Lanka was opposing these sorts of resolutions. In 2016 and 2017, the government of Sri Lanka acceded to the resolution and cosponsored it. Sri Lanka itself has agreed. In the UNHRC, it is a consensual consensus. Sri Lanka agreed and it is not possible for it go back on this promise. The absence of the US will not make much of an impact.
*But, the US is not there to push for the implementation of the resolution
You need not be in the council to do it. They will still support is. When a vote is taken, of course, the US will not be there.

The government has not commenced work even on the matters that have been touched upon. It is up to the UNHRCs decision
Q The US seems to be talking different approach towards Sri Lanka under the Trump administration. What is your view
I do not say the US position has changed.
Q How do you look at the next presidential election
The TNA is for the abolition of executive presidency. If it is done, there wont be any presidential election. That is our position. If it happens anyway, we will take a decision at that time.
Q Do you see the rise of the Rajapaksa camp politically in the south as a disturbing trend
There is no rise of the Rajapaksa camp. His side polled only 46% of votes at the local authorities elections. All the other parties polled 52% of votes. In that sense, the vote base of the Rajapaksa camp has declined not increased. 
Q But, it is still the single largest party...
Yes. That is right. We urge the parties that were together at 2015 elections to stay together for the future as well.

SL may introduce laws banning FB for minors: Minister
	
Sri Lanka may have to introduce laws to ban minors using Facebook in the wake of several countries having done so, Childrens and Womens Affairs Minister Chandrani Bandara said yesterday.
She said this at a ceremony held at Temple Trees yesterday to mark Worlds Childrens Day.
Several countries have introduced laws banning minors using Facebook. Sri Lanka will have to do the same considering the present circumstances. Parents tend to think that their children are safe when they are in their rooms. However, today's advanced technology can destroy a childs mind even if they are in their rooms at home, the minister said.
She said children spend more time on the internet instead of discussing matters with their parents, who are busy trying to advance their professions.
The minister said Sri Lanka would have to think of ways of allowing a child to access the internet to obtain information needed for their educational needs.
"The Education Ministry has decided to limit the number subjects for the GCE Advanced Level Examination and to change the nature of grade five scholarship examinations so that children would not be subjected to pressure as it is the case now," she said. "The minister said children are today exploited by global forces. According to the International Labor Organization (ILO), 82 per cent of children between the ages of five and 11 are employed in the agricultural sector, 4.7 per cent in the industrial sector and 12.5 per cent in other sectors while 69.9 per cent of the children between the ages of 12 and 14 are employed in the agricultural sector, and 12 per cent in the industrial sector."
The minister said the situation in Sri Lanka is better. "However, last year 4,000 children were exploited in Sri Lanka while 956 children were subjected to violence, 112 children employed as labourers and 117 children subjected sexual harassment. (Yohan Perera)

SLIM Brand Excellence 2018 shines the spotlight on SME sector
	
Sixteen years ago, SLIM made history by introducing the first awards ceremony dedicated to recognizing and rewarding the best brandsand brand custodians. Today the awards campaign that began with 26 entries has far exceeded the expectations of its founders. In September the organizers of SLIM Brand Excellence 2018 announced that there wasa record-breaking number of applications entered for the awards this year. This is a testament to the growing popularity of SLIM Brand Excellence as a prestigious awards campaign that serves as a platform of development for brands, brand managers and entrepreneurs.
It has been observed that SMEs are the driversof business in the nations economic activity.As the national body of marketing, SLIM supports the development of this sector via SLIM Brand Excellence. It is hoped that the awards campaign will present members of SMEs with the opportunity to gain vital knowledge and encouragement to become a more significant part of the marketing fraternity of Sri Lanka.
In a bid to increase the number of entries from the SME sector, the SME entry kit has been revised and simplified. The Sinhala SME entry kit was also introduced for the first time this year. SLIM Brand Excellence has been revamped over the past few months by a group of expert marketers. Also the International Brand Award has been included in the main awards category. Such strategic moves serve as a means of motivating participation and thereby supporting the participants evolutionto the next level in their business. Thisensures the development of the countrys marketing fraternity in the long term.
The awards stand upon four primary pillars, which are intent, content, process and performance. The judging process consists of two stages  desk evaluation and the presentation of the brand story. The latter gives the judges an opportunity to assess the passion and creativity behind the efforts, recognize the individual behind the concept and to consider it a career achievement by recognizing the brand and the brand custodian.
As the national body for marketing, SLIM serves to use events such as, the SLIM Brand Excellence Awards, NASCO, the Effies and the Peoples Awards in order to encourage strategic and result-oriented thinking in the fields of brand development, sales, advertising and research.

Stemming economic crisis -- CB, 3 ministries to work out strategies
	
The Ministries of Finance, Development Strategies and International trade and Trade and Commerce and the Central Bank will, within a week, decide on the steps to be taken to keep the rupee stable in the wake of the global economic crisis, sources close to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
They said he had directed the three ministries and the Central Bank to work out strategies to minimize the effect on Sri Lanka from the fallout of US sanctions on Iran and the trade war between the USA and China.
The sources said these strategies would be implemented no sooner the Prime Minister returned from Norway.
Meanwhile, the economic experts have informed the government that Sri Lankas tea exports might come to a standstill when the US sanctions become effective in November this year and that China was unlikely to lend funds to Sri Lanka as a result of high tariffs imposed on its exports by the US.

Supreme Court of India Redeems itself with judgments
	

It was only in January this year that the legitimacy of the Indian Supreme Court was under serious scrutiny following an unprecedented press conference held by four judges of the court led by Justice J. Chelameswar, second in the pecking order after Chief Justice Dipak Misra.
In a written statement issued to a stunned media, the four judges said that the internal administration of the countrys highest court was so vitiated by the high-handedness of Chief Justice Dipak Misra, that Indian democracy would itself be in peril if highhandedness and arbitrariness of this sort were not checked immediately.
They alleged that Chief Justice Misra was exceeding his powers as the first among equals by manipulating the roster to get some politically sensitive cases heard by a suitable roster of judges.
One of the cases was the mysterious death of Judge B.H. Loya, who was hearing a murder case involving Amit Shah, President of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
Eventually, the internal dispute was patched up. And Chief Justice Misra not only nominated Justice Ranjan Gogoi, one of the leaders of the revolt, as his successor (As per rules) but gave a series of landmark judgments which strengthened social justice, equity and democracy.
By the end of Misras tenure on September 30, the Indian Supreme Court had redeemed itself well and truly.

Thanks to another recent Supreme Court judgment, adultery is no longer a crime in India though without a shadow of a doubt it could be a ground for divorce. The Chief Justice further said that adultery might not be the cause of an unhappy marriage. It could well be the result of one.
Landmark Rulings
Historically, the famous Ayyappan temple in Sabarimala in Kerala, was out of bounds to women because Lord Ayyappan was a celibate. Menstruating women were barred and even men devotees had to be ritually purified through a rigorous process over a period of 40 days before being allowed in.
On a petition filed against this, Chief Justice Misra and Justice A.M. Khanwilkar ruled that devotion could not be subject to gender discrimination. Justices Rohinton F. Nariman and Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud concurred.
Thanks to another recent Supreme Court judgment, adultery is no longer a crime in India though without a shadow of doubt it could be a ground for divorce.
The husband is not the master of the wife, said the five-judge bench, unanimously striking down the Victorian adultery law.
The law punished a man who had an affair with a woman without the consent or connivance of her husband and the punishment was five years in jail. There was no punishment for the woman, who was seen as the victim.
The wife cant be treated as chattel and its time to say that husband is not the master of the woman, Chief Justice Misra said.
The judges noted that most countries had abolished laws against adultery and making adultery a crime would mean punishing unhappy people.
The Chief Justice further said that adultery might not be the cause of an unhappy marriage. It could well be the result of one.
Justice Misra, who was thought to be pro-BJP, gave the judgment despite the fact that the BJP Government had opposed the petition filed by Joseph Shine a 41-year-old Indian businessman.
The Supreme Court recently ruled that the production of the Biometric Identity Card, called Aadhaar, could not be deemed mandatory for availing of various Government-sponsored services, especially services for the poor and disadvantaged.
This followed the death of a child, who could not be admitted to a government hospital because her parents did not have the Adhaar Card. The court further said that the Adhaar Card was primarily meant to see that the Governments food scheme (Which costs US$ 23.6 billion a year) reached the targeted poor group and was not monopolized by the well to do.
The judges also struck down a Government effort to make Adhaar mandatory for opening bank accounts or taking a mobile telephone connection or getting school admission.
The Supreme Court ruled that Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code could not punish gay sex between consenting adults. However, it could punish non-consensual sex, sex with minors and bestiality.
As per Section 377 IPC unnatural offences include voluntary carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal. It shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.
Supreme Courts chequered history
The Indian Supreme Court has had a chequered history like other democratic institutions in the country. In the 1950s, immediately after independence from Britain, the court tended to be conservative.
In 1951, it struck down a Madras Government order which provided for reservations in Government jobs and educational institutions for the backward classes or castes.
This prompted the then Indian Government led by Jawaharlal Nehru to bring about the First Amendment to the Indian Constitution to provide for reservations for backward communities.
In the 1960s, leftist politics had taken over India. In 1969, to make banks open their doors to all, including the poor, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi nationalized 14 major banks. The Supreme Court followed suit and reversed an earlier ruling of 1967 in which it had said that under no circumstances could Fundamental Rights be violated.
But in 1970, when Indira Gandhi abolished the Privy Purses given to the 500-odd Indian Princes, when their States were absorbed in the Indian Union, the Supreme Court struck it down on the grounds that abolition of the purses was a breach of a solemn promise.

But the court fought back and in 1993 it introduced the Collegium System to choose judges for the Supreme Court and the High Courts in which a Collegium of Judges would do the choosing.
In 1973, in the Keshavananda Bharati-vs-State of Kerala case, the court battled over the question as to whether parliament has an unbridled power to amend the Constitution including Fundamental Rights.
On a plain reader, Article 368 did not contain any limitation on the power of parliament to amend any part of the Constitution. The court ruled that parliament could amend the constitution but not its basic structure or the essential features of the Constitution.
The Kesavananda Bharati case was the culmination of a serious conflict brewing between the judiciary and the Indira Gandhi regime.
In 1975, the Allahabad High Court had unseated Indira Gandhi from Parliament on the grounds that she had used official personnel and privileges in her 1971 election campaign in Rae Bareily constituency.
When she challenged this in the Supreme Court, Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer, a committed Leftist Judge, stayed the order so that she could continue as Prime Minister.
By then Indira Gandhi had introduced the concept of a committee judiciary and committed bureaucracy so that her radical socialistic programmes could be implemented. She packed the Supreme Court with committed judges.
After she declared the State of Emergency later in 1975, (triggered by a movement which called on the police and officials not to obey illegal orders), Indira Gandhi got the court to set aside the judgment unseating her from Parliament.
After the end of the Emergency in 1977, Governments did try to manipulate the Supreme Court. One way of manipulating it was to determine the appointment of judges.
But the court fought back and in 1993 it introduced the Collegium System to choose judges for the Supreme Court and the High Courts in which a Collegium of Judges would do the choosing.
But since it was the Government which should finally make the appointment, governments would delay or send back nominations, which they did not favour. However, the January 2018 revolt of four senior Supreme Court judges has reined in the Government in this regard.

80TH ANNIVERSARY OF MUNICH BETRAYAL
	
It was one of the most tragic days of the 20th century: on September 30, 1938, Prime Minister of Great Britain N. Chamberlain, his French colleague E. Daladier, A. Hitler and B. Mussolini met in Munich to make a deal on the transferring of the Sudetenland area of Czechoslovakia to Germany. Czechoslovak delegates were only invited to be coerced into signing the pact. This notorious agreement went down in history as the Munich Betrayal. The governments of Poland and Hungary also took part in the shameless division of Czechoslovakia. 
The Munich Agreement crowned the essentially criminal policy of appeasement of the Third Reich. The countries that agreed to that collusion - Great Britain and France- had an illusory hope of avoiding the threat of Hitlers aggression and tried to redirect it at the East. Among the concessions to the Nazi regime were the connivance of the re-militarisation of Hitlers Germany, noninterference in the civil war in Spain from 1936 to 1939 amid flagrant Italian-German support for the Franco insurgency, the silent acceptance of the Anschluss of Austria, and the refusal to cooperate with the Soviet Union on building a collective security system in Europe.
Historians consider the events that took place in Munich on that day to be British and French capitulation before the rising Nazism, which allowed Hitler to unleash the Second World War, a global disaster that resulted in untold losses to all humankind. The USSR alone lost nearly 30 million lives. It took considerable time and incredible effort to create the anti-Hitler coalition in order to defeat Germany and liberate Europe.

The Munich Agreement crowned the essentially criminal policy of appeasement of the Third Reich
We believe that the Munich Betrayal must serve as a reminder of disastrous consequences of disregard for international law, belief in ones own exceptionalism and infallibility, and reliance on national egotism. These lessons of the past should be a warning to all of us, given the current realities. It is obvious that real security can only be equal and indivisible and should be based on the fundamental principles of international relations stipulated in the UN Charter: respect for the sovereignty of States, non-interference in their internal affairs and peaceful settlement of disputes.
Russia will continue to contribute in every possible way to the strengthening of global and regional stability and to working out common responses to the numerous challenges and threats of the present.

The imperious lady is a source of humour for them!
	
The arrogant conduct of a tall lady holding secretarial status in a Diyawanna committee has become a source of good humour for the employees of the august assembly, they say.
If a khakied one on duty failed to salute her, she would bark at him, I say, dont you know what my position is You had better learn to pay due respect to your superiors!
When she arrives for duty, a security guard is expected to open the door of her car and two of her subordinates should rush forward, for one to relieve her of a bundle of files and the other her handbag and she would walk ramrod straight to her office. And the employees would watch this familiar scene with derisive smiles, they say.

WASHINGTON AFP, Oct1, 2018 - Negotiators from Canada and the United States went down to the wire but were able to reach an agreement on a new free trade pact that will include Mexico, the governments announced late Sunday night. 
The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) updates and replaces the nearly 25-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which President Donald Trump had labeled a disaster and promised to cancel. 
The rewrite will result in freer markets, fairer trade and robust economic growth in our region, according to a joint statement from US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Canadas Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland.

US$157.5 mn released within four days to stabilize rupee: Bandula
	
The Central Bank has released US$157.7 million to the market within four days to stabilise the rupee which stands at Rs.170 against the US dollar, joint opposition (JO) MP Bandula Gunawardana today said.
When the IMF is releasing US$169 million to Sri Lanka as loans, he said the evaporation of US$157.5 million to stabilise the rupee would only result in a further increase in the cost of living.
This move may lead to a price increase of essential items and services such as fuel and bus fares. The rapid depreciation of the rupee is the result of the fiscal mismanagement by the government and there is no point in blaming the Rajapaksa government, he told a news briefing.
Meanwhile, he said the President had invited him to attend a special discussion on the current state of economic affairs but said he was unable to take part because he had not received the consent of JO party leaders.
He said both the economic affairs meeting and the JO party leaders meeting were scheduled at the same time on Tuesday night.
I cannot attend the discussion on economic affairs without the consent of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and the other party leaders, he told a news briefing.(Lahiru Pothmulla)

Will not disarm before US relaxes sanctions:  North Korea
	

N. Korea, (Daily Mail), 30 September 2018 - North Koreas foreign minister on Saturday told the United Nations there was no way that his country would disarm first as long as the United States continued to push for tough enforcement of sanctions against Pyongyang.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho accused Washington of creating a deadlock in talks on denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. The recent deadlock is because the US relies on coercive measures which are lethal to trust-building, Ri told the assembly.
Without any trust in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first. A landmark summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June led to a warming of ties and a halt in Pyongyangs missile launches, but there has been little concrete progress toward denuclearization.
