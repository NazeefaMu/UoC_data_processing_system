Chennai airport closed until noon on Sunday
	
	NEW DELHI: With no end to rains in Chennai and water logging on the runway, the Airports Authority of India has suspended operations in the city's airport until noon on Sunday.

	On Wednesday, the AAI evacuated about 1,500 passengers, who were stuck at the airport. "People could not leave because the road outside the airport is submerged in knee-deep water. We have arranged for six buses to evacuate passengers," said the official.
	About 2,000 employees of airlines or the airport were still stranded at the airport on Wednesday evening.

	The airport nearest to Chennai is Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh and it is likely to be used to send relief material and support to the city, a senior civil aviation ministry official said.
	Operations at the airport cannot resume unless the water recedes, the official said. "Once the water recedes, the runway will be checked before starting operations."
	SpiceJetBSE 7.23 % said it is monitoring the situation. "All our operations at Chennai Airport have been suspended till further instructions as the airport is waterlogged and the tarmac is submerged in one-and-half feet of water," SpiceJet said in a news release, citing Chief Administrative Officer GP Gupta.

Duty-free vehicle permits: UNP  MPs prefer cash grant
	
	Most of the United National Party (UNP) MPs have objected to the withdrawal of the duty- free vehicle permits which had been earlier issued to MPs and professionals and instead sought a cash grant for all categories, it is learnt.
	The UNP conducted a workshop during the weekend for its MPs at a resort in Bentota to discuss budgetary proposals and other political matters.
	Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake briefed the MPs on the budgetary proposals and pointed out that the government would lose a huge amount of revenue if such permits were issued. He said even vehicle dealers were taking undue advantage of the duty-free permits issued to the professionals and as such a cash grant would be more advisable.
	The MPs also requested for the fertilizer subsidy to be continued instead of the issuance of cash vouchers to paddy cultivators.
	Meanwhile, moves are afoot to amend the 2016 Budget to accommodate fresh proposals from the members of the two main parties. (Kelum Bandara)

Employers Federation of Ceylon clarifies
	
		 		 
		 
			
Apropos to the article titled Employers Federation slams private sector wage increase published in Mirror Business yesterday, the Employers Federation of Ceylon (EFC) sent the following clarification.
Article titled Employers Federation slams private sector wage increase
We write with reference to the above article which has been published in the Late City Edition of Mirror Business, Page 1 of the Daily Mirror newspaper (December 1, 2015) by Shabiya Ali Ahlam.
In the first instance, it is observed that the title of the article is imprecise as the brief discussion with Shabiya Ali Ahlam centred on a question that was posed to the undersigned as to whether the EFC had agreed to the governments proposal to legislate on a wage increase for the private sector employees. I confirm having answered the query posed in the negative and that we are principally opposed to such a move. I also went on to explain the reasons for entering into a dialogue as set out in our circular to members 77 of 2015 dated November 23, 2015, as it is incumbent upon us to do so as a policymaker.
As you know the Employers Federation of Ceylon is an institution which is reputed for constructive criticism in pursuance of safeguarding the interests of employers as well as the country. Further, we have always endeavoured to solve issues through a healthy dialogue with the government and its authorities in order to ensure that the best interests of all stakeholders are addressed.
Whilst we do concede that the matters that have been reported are consistent with what has been said in the past, it would have been far better if the facts were presented in the context of our circular that was discussed with Shabiya Ali Ahlam when she spoke to me yesterday. In fact, our intention was for the article to carry the latest position as set out in the circular under reference which was circulated amongst our membership (also published in our website www.employers.lk).
Several rounds of discussions have been held with the authorities since our letter addressed to the Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister dated October 20, 2015, and we expect our concerns to be addressed in the finalized legislation as explained in our circular No.77/2015, as well.
In conclusion, we hope that the usual courtesies extended to those interviewed will be extended to us in the future and that the statements attributed to us would be quoted in context, in the interests of constructive criticism.
We hope that you will publish this letter by way of a clarification in order to set the record straight.

Govt. aiming for 9 % growth by 2030
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today the government was aiming to achieve a 9% growth by 2030 and though the task could be termed difficult it was not an impossible task.
We have to achieve this by 2030. We must become a high income country. All our efforts have to be mobilized to achieve this goal. With the mini budget 2015, we increased the aggregate demand so that there is surplus in the hands of ordinary people. It is already seen in the increase in consumer goods. But there is still a lot of available and untapped consumable income in the economy, especially in the balance sheets of some of our companies, he said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said they wanted to ensure that a strong middle class exists in this country. A lot of what happens in the coming years cannot be controlled by us. It is going to be in the hands of actors outside this country, he said.
He said the country would have a high deficit initially but as investments grow and as revenue grows and we bring more and more people into the net, the government should be able to achieve its target for 2020.

## Title: HNB Grameen records impressive 227% profit growth in 1H15

HNB Grameen records impressive 227% profit growth in 1H15
	
HNB Grameen Finance Limited has ended the first half of 2015 with a profit before tax (PBT) of Rs.853 million, up from Rs.261 million in the first half of 2014, recording a staggering 227 percent growth in profits.
The profit-after-tax of the company has seen a sharp rise of 198 percent to Rs.524 million, from Rs.176 million in the corresponding period last year. These figures are noteworthy as they have been achieved in fiercely competitive environment.
HNB Grameen has maintained its non-performing loan (NPL) ratio below 1 percent, a remarkable achievement in an industry where the gross NPL average is above 6 percent. The company has recorded a ratio of 0.832 percent in the first half of 2015, while the figure for the corresponding period in the previous year was 0.67 percent. This is a direct result of the companys excellent credit management practices, which have been strengthened by a well-defined credit evaluation process and a tenacious recovery mechanism.
The capital reduction which was carried out during this quarter has been successful in wiping out the retained loss and has strengthened the balance sheet with a significant growth in the core capital.
The first half of 2015 was notable for the rebranding which took place within the company following the acquisition of Prime Grameen by banking giant Hatton National Bank (HNB) in late 2014. Under its new identity HNB Grameen has solidified its leadership position through enhanced synergies with HNB, which is the majority shareholder with a 51 percent stake in the company, while Prime Lands (Pvt.) Ltd retains a 47.5 percent stake.
Commenting on the performance, HNB Grameen Chairman Jonathan Alles stated, HNB Grameen, the most recent addition to the HNB group, has shown significant growth momentum both in its asset book and profitability whilst maintaining the quality of the loan portfolio. The exceptional performance of the company despite the challenging environment bears witness to the strong commitment of the team and the robust business model. 
HNB Grameen is a company which has enjoyed strong public confidence over the years, and the latest figures indicate that this confidence has been further strengthened. Public deposits, which include fixed deposits and savings, have increased by 58 percent to Rs.8479 million from Rs.5369 million in 2014 and loans and advances have seen a remarkable growth of 97.35 percent to Rs.7,947 million from Rs.4,063 in the previous year. Another highlight of the first half was Fitch Ratings assigning HNB Grameen a national long-term rating of A (lka) with a stable outlook, reaffirming that the company is in a strong position to build on the momentum of the first half.
HNB Grameen Managing Director/CEO Chaminda Prabhath thanked the customers for the continuing faith and loyalty shown by them.
I would like to thank our loyal customer base for making HNB Grameen their preferred financial partner on their journey of development. During the first half we strategically focused on the small scale enterprises (SSE) segment by introducing a loan scheme to provide them superior financial solutions and so far we have been successful in penetrating that market. Another area of focus for us was the expansion of our reach island wide and towards this end we have opened new service centres in several unbanked areas, demonstrating our commitment to serving all Sri Lankans. I thank each and every staff member for being our strength and working tirelessly to reach our targets through enhanced productivity. I would also like to thank the experienced board of directors of HNB Grameen for their support and guidance at all times.
The first half of 2015 saw several exciting initiatives on the technological front within the company which are aimed at achieving increased efficiency in future. These include the setting up of a state-of-the-art, fully centralized core banking system, which demonstrates far-sighted continuity planning and signing up for the Microsoft Enterprise Agreement, the worlds leading volume licensing package by software giant Microsoft.
HNB Grameen hopes to expand its product portfolio in the second half of 2015 with the addition of leasing and SSE products, in order to cater to the financial needs of all Sri Lankans. Furthermore, plans are in place to list the company on the Colombo Stock Exchange.

Indian SC blocks release of Gandhis killers
	
The Indian Supreme Court has blocked the release of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhis killers on Wednesday, saying the Tamil Nadu government had no power to remit their sentences without the Centres consent, Hindustan Times reported.
The top court upheld life sentences for all seven convicts in the case, saying the state government couldnt release them as the Centre had the final say in cases where the probe was carried out by a central agency such as the CBI.
A five-judge Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice HL Dattu was hearing a petition by the central government challenging a 2014 order by Tamil Nadu to free the convicts, a move aimed at cashing in on pro-Tamil sentiments before the Lok Sabha polls.
On February 18 last year, the apex court had commuted the sentences of AG Perarivalan alias Arivu, Sriharan alias Murugan and T Suthentiraraja alias Santhan, who were the only ones facing the death penalty in the case at the time, citing inordinate delay in their executions. Four others were already serving life terms.
A day later, Tamil Nadu announced the release of the convicts, triggering widespread celebrations in the state with support from all political parties, except the Congress.
The former PM was killed by a suicide bomber from the LTTE while campaigning in an election in Tamil Nadus Sriperumbudur city in 1991 after he dispatched Indian troops to aid Sri Lanka in its fight against the separatist militant group.
A total of 26 people were found guilty of conspiring to kill Gandhi, but 19 of them were later acquitted amid a wave of sympathy for the killers, who were seen to have been fighting for the Tamil cause in Sri Lanka.

Korea Programme on International Agriculture (KOPIA) Sri Lanka Centre Director Dr. Byoung Choon Jang conducted a trial performance of the Korean rice transplanting machines recently at the rice model farm village in Rajanganaya, Anuradhapura.
A total of three Korean rice transplanting machines were donated to the farm village by the KOPIA Centre.
Under the KOPIA project to improve productivity and quality of rice in Sri Lanka, the trial performance took place and training programmes such as basic agronomic practices and transplanting machine use were provided for 30 selected local farmers. Those farmers began using the Korean transplanting machine in the paddy field and it is expected to save labour effectively in practice.
On this occasion, Dr. Jang also introduced new technologies regarding paddy soil management, proper fertilizer application and post-harvest management, which will help Sri Lankan farmers develop their farming system.
The KOPIA Centre was established by the Rural Development Administration (RDA) of the Republic of Korea in order to cooperate with Sri Lanka for its agricultural technology development.

	Several expressways had been proposed to be built in the Western Province to bypass the Colombo city to ease the day-to-day traffic congestions, the City Planning and Water Supply State Minister Sudarshini Fernandopulle said today.
	An expressway from Borella to Kaduwela had been proposed to be built to ease the traffic while another was proposed from Kelaniya connecting the Colombo Katunayaka Expressway, she said.
	The number of vehicles on the road had increased during the past six months. Public transportation system had not been developed as development occurred in the countrys middle class.
	Old transportation systems are still operational in the country with old trains and old buses. That is why most of the people are trying to drive their own vehicle which adds to the heavy traffic on the roads.
	The government is also thinking Park and Ride concept again while developing the public transport system in the Colombo city, she said.
	As the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) we request the government to remove the tax on zero emission electric vehicles, which had been proposed in the budget 2016. That is because it is essential to protect the environment pollution.

No elephant births in captivity reported for 6 yrs-Wild Life
	
	Not a single elephant birth has been reported and no elephant registration had taken place from 2009 to 2013, Wild Life Conservation Department said today. Consequently, Wild Life Department officials are not aware of the number of calves that were born during the past six years.
	Speaking at a media briefing held yesterday in Battaramulla, the director general of the WLD, Dr. H.D.Ratnayake said it was mandatory for elephant owners to inform the department when a female elephant got pregnant and again inform the department within seven days of the birth of an elephant calf.
	However, he said, neither elephant births nor pregnancies of captive female elephants had been reported/notified during past six years.
	There were strict regulations in place, he said, and several detections had been made of persons keeping elephants illegally with fraudulent elephant registration licenses. The owners had been arrested.
	The DG said the elephant calf registration process would be soon be re-started.
	Meanwhile, the Wild life Conservation Department has decided to start a new e-booking service to enable the public to reserve wildlife bungalows and camping sites in national parks via the Internet.
	Payment for the reservations could be made with credit cards and mobile phones, he said.
	Mr. Ratnayake said the new method was introduced to ease things for visitors, especially tourists, as there were long waiting lists.
	Respoding to a question, he denied the allegation that he had knowingly allowed wildlife crime networks, led by the likes of Maharagama Roshan (alias Ali Roshan), to kidnap elephants and register them using false documents regarding their birth.
	I never allowed anyone to kidnap elephants. I have signed documents which were approved by our officials after being double checked. I am ready to answer any questions raised by anyone regarding the matter, he said.
	Speaking about the new programme, which introduced bio-fences to solve the long-standing human-elephant conflict, he said the number of bio-fences and electric fences would be increased; and that Civil Defence personnel were helping Wild Life Conservation Department personnel to supervise and maintain the fences.

Pathfinder and Korea embark on feasibility study for bilateral FTA
	
		 		 
		 
			
The Pathfinder Foundation in cooperation with the Embassy of the Republic of Korea (ROK) has commissioned a study on the feasibility of entering into a free trade agreement (FTA) between ROK and Sri Lanka.
The objective of this study is to analyse the past performance and current scenario in trade, investment and services-related development to ascertain the feasibility of establishing a trade and investment promotion agreement.
The major focus areas of the study will be on: trade agreements and trade policies of ROK and Sri Lanka, economic relations between ROK and Sri Lanka, sectoral impacts of trade agreement, potential economic effects of ROK Sri Lanka trade agreement.
The proposed study consists of analysis from perspectives of both ROK and Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan segment of the study is carried out by Pathfinder Foundation Fellow Dr. O.G. Dayaratne-Banda of the Department of Economics, University of Peradeniya who during his post-doctoral research in Canada looked at regional economic cooperation and trade arrangements in Asia. The Korean segment will be commissioned to Prof. Yoocheul Song of Dongduk Womens University and Senior Research Fellow of Centre for International Economic Studies.
ROK  Sri Lanka relations goes back to post 1977 economic liberalization era. During the 1980s and 1990s ROK was a leading investor in Sri Lanka both inside and outside the Export Processing Zones in Katunayake and Biyagama. In addition to its contribution in investment, the ROK participation in construction activities resulted in improving the local know-how and quality management in housing and other construction industries. With the heightening of the armed conflict in Sri Lanka, the interest of Korean investors declined to some extent although ROK has been helping Sri Lanka in vocational training and providing employment in Korea for skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled workers.
The rationale of the Pathfinder Foundation for undertaking such research is to complement the government-to-government efforts being undertaken by Sri Lanka and ROK for promoting bilateral trade and investment. Upon completion of the study, plans are ahead for conducting a seminar, tentatively scheduled for the third week of December, with the participation of a select group of policymakers, professionals, business community and other stakeholders for a dialogue to assist in finalizing the feasibility report, taking into consideration views of the local audience. This seminar is being organised by the Pathfinder Foundation with the support of the Korean Embassy.
Sri Lanka has active FTAs with both India and Pakistan while one with China is currently under negotiation. The Pathfinder Foundation believes that entering into similar arrangements with developed economies such as ROK would result in opening Sri Lankan producers to larger and sophisticated markets, while promoting inward investment and tourism.

Phone going off inside Court is not contempt of court: HCLA
	
Commenting on a case filed against former solicitor general and President Counsel Rienzie Arsakularatne, whose mobile phone had reportedly rung inside the Galle High Court, the Hultsdorp High Court Lawyers Association (HCLA) today affirmed that when a phone rings inside a Court room it could not be considered a Contempt of Court as the occurrence was an involuntary act.
Secretary of the HCLA, Counsel Mohan Sellapperuma, explained that it was unreasonable to bring contempt of court charges against an individual for an involuntary act such as a person's phone going off since it is not an deliberate act.
If we dont get a proper solution from other institutions, all High Court lawyers at Hultsdorp would be present in court for the case against PC Arsakularatne on January 22.
Meanwhile, the Colombo Magistrates Court Lawyers Association also expressed their solidarity with PC Arsakularatne saying if this matter is not settled amicably they would organize a peaceful protest against the Galle High Court Judges decision to bring charges against PC Arsakularatne.(Shehan Chamika Silva)

Strict control over use of police uniform
	
A recent advertisement featuring a Policeman has made the Police Department to strictly enforce the existing laws, which require the entertainment industry to request permission for the use of the Police Uniform.
Police Spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said that he had lodged a complaint with the Fort Police today against the advertisement which allegedly ridiculed Policemen.
Legal action would be taken against the producer and the actors of the advertisement, he said.
ASP Gunasekara said the advertisement humiliated the Department which was established to protect and enforce the law.
This is not the first time such an incident has taken place. It has happened on many occasions, he said.
The Spokesman said the Department would enforce existing laws.
Any production which humiliates the Department is punishable under the Police Penal Code 84. Therefore, unauthorised use of the Police uniform or a dress similar to Police uniform is a punishable act. A person could be remanded for three months for violating this law, he said.
Permission would need to be sought from the IGP or the Ministry of Law and Order for the use of Police uniforms in any production in the future, he said. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
