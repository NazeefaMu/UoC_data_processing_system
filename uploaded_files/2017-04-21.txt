Australia toughens process to gain citizenship
	
Australia, which hosts one of the largest Sri Lankan Diasporas overseas, will make it more difficult to gain citizenship in a major overhaul of its migration process, the BBC reported yesterday.
Aspiring citizens will undergo tougher tests on their English language skills and ability to demonstrate "Australian values", PM Malcolm Turnbull has said.
Applicants must also have completed four years as a permanent resident - three years longer than at present.
The move comes two days after Australia unveiled stricter visa requirements for skilled workers from overseas.
Turnbull said the changes would ensure that migrants were better integrated into the community.
"It is important that they understand that they are making a commitment to our Australian values," he said.
In explaining what constituted "Australian values", Turnbull said migrants must demonstrate support for religious freedom and gender equality.
"Respect for women and children ... that is a key Australian value," he said, adding domestic violence would not be tolerated.
A more stringent English language test involving reading, writing, listening and speaking is one of the other changes included in the citizenship process.
Providing evidence of integration into the community, such as employment history, school enrolment or membership of community organizations, having already been a permanent resident for at least four years, allowing applicants to apply only three times and automatically failing anyone who cheats on a test are also new changed made by the government in its migration process.
When asked about reports that applicants would be quizzed on whether they supported forced child marriage or female genital mutilation, Turnbull said it was important to "reinforce our values".
"If we believe that respect for women and children [is an Australian value]... then why should that not be made a key part, a fundamental part, a very prominent part, of our process to be an Australian citizen?"
The requirements would apply to all new applications for citizenship, the government said.
The opposition Labor Party accused Turnbull of making announcements for political gain.
"It seems a little odd to me that you would actually ask people whether or not they are going to obey the law when they already pledge to obey the law," said Labor senator Penny Wong.

Diagnosing mental illness through Astrology
	
?
By Sandagomi
Mental illness is not a subject alien to Astrology. In fact, mental disease is an integral part of Medical Astrology based on principles propounded by the ancient sages in India. However, it appears that in recent times, it is the Western Astrologers who have evinced a greater interest in research on Medical Astrology ? Mental illness in particular than the practitioners of?
Vedic Astrology.?
?
Natal Chart providing the clue to diagnosing mental illness
Meanwhile, some medical practitioners specialized in Western Medicine and proficient in Astrology as well have created a new wave of awareness and interest in the subject of mental illness in particular among the astrologers in India with their findings that the Natal Chart of an individual is more useful in diagnosing the nature of a mental illness than the most modern diagnostic means available to a psychiatrist today. ?
Disentangling complexities
Certain medical specialists have concluded through studies over the years that the Natal Chart of an individual helps in determining:
?
The true nature of the mental disorder
The degree of the severity of the disorder and ?as to when the illness turns very severe and how long the symptoms last.
?
Astrological explanation for ?spontaneous remission??
It has astounded medical specialists to observe that the condition of mental patients shows a dramatic improvement when the adverse transit of a malefic planet or a Dasa of a such a malefic planet comes to an end. This condition in Western Medicine is referred to as ?spontaneous remission.?
A basic understanding of the nature of mental disorders and what planets are responsible for causing mental disorders and why their malefic influence cause these illnesses is necessary to appreciate the rationale for this phenomenon.?
?
A broad classification of mental disorders?
The entire gamut of mental illnesses, according to medical specialists, could be brought under two categories namely:
Major mental disorders where the individual loses touch with reality and is unaware that he is mentally unsound and?
Minor mental disorders where the individual is aware that there is something mentally wrong?
with him.?
?
Sub-groupings
Those belonging to the category 2 are divided into two subgroups:
Those constantly plagued by anxiety and concomitant conditions such as irritability, fear, worry, nervousness, trepidation, stress and apprehension and
Those suffering from depression and conditions like guilt, despair, despondency, melancholy, prolonged bereavement and loss of interest.?
It is a paradox that almost all planets who are responsible for causing mental disorders are natural benefics. However, they get the power to cause them when they are afflicted.
?
Planets giving or denying good health
The planets mainly responsible for sound or unsound mental health are the Moon, Mercury and Jupiter. These planets together either keep a native in perfect good mental health or cause him mental illness. ?The Moon in a Natal Chart rules the mind and the thinking of the native, Mercury intellect, rationality, logic and the nervous system and Jupiter wisdom. When these three planets are afflicted, what they rule too get adversely affected.?
?
The role of?the Sun
Most astrologers agree that an afflicted Sun too could contribute towards making an individual unsound in mind, because the Sun rules the soul and the general health of an individual. The natural malefics such as Mars, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu are responsible for afflicting the benefics such as Jupiter, Mercury and the Moon. They afflict the Sun too who himself is considered a malefic.In the matter of judging the mental condition or the mental health of an individual, the status of the 1st, 4th and 5th Houses too should be taken into consideration. Because 1st House represents the head and the brain as well as the self, the 4th House the feelings and emotions and the 5th House the intellect, intelligence?and thinking.?
?
Understanding afflicted and afflicting planets?
An Indian psychiatrist who has obtained positive results from research and experimentation on diagnosing major mental disorders says that the nature of the mental illness can be ascertained from the relationship between the afflicted and the afflicting planets aided by a good understanding of the inherent qualities of such afflicted and afflicting planets. The natural qualities the?
planets rule are:
Moon: feelings, emotions, love, attachment, intuition and tenderness.
Mercury: deep thoughts, logic, analysis, mathematics, rationality, planning.
Mars: ?hot temperament, impulsiveness, knee-jerk reactions, violence and anger
?Saturn: cunning, obstacle, suffering, stoic behaviour and suppression
Rahu: Evil thoughts, suffering, inciting, tempting, fantasizing

French police officers backing Marine Le Pen in Sunday?s election
	
France, (Daily Mail, London), 20 April 2017 -
More than half of police officers in France have said they are voting for far-right candidate Marine Le Pen in Sunday?s election because of her strong anti-terror stance.
According to the IFOP poll, 51 per cent of the Gendarmerie are planning to back Le Pen in the nail-biting election.
That is more than double the number of people who are backing her nearest rival, centrist Emmanuel Macron (16.5 per cent).Le Pen has pledged to beef up law and ?order in her manifesto, with 15,000 more police officers, deporting ?foreign criminals and closing extremist mosques.
According to the poll, Le Pen?s strongest base of support is among working-age people with lower education. Le Pen told supporters in Paris: ?I will protect you. My first measure as president will be to reinstate France?s borders.
?The choice on Sunday is simple. It is a choice between a France that is rising again and a France that is sinking.

## Title: Japan may help SL buy P-3C maritime surveillance aircraft

Japan may help SL buy P-3C maritime surveillance aircraft
	
Japan may help Sri Lanka buy P-3C maritime surveillance aircraft, apart from persuading India and the US to make Sri Lanka a base for strategic maritime surveillance over the Indian Ocean Region, the News in Asia reported yesterday.
These are indicated by Japanese security expert, Dr. Satoru Nagao, who is now Research Fellow at the Colombo-based Institute of National Security Studies (INSS), in his latest paper entitled: ?Japan can be the best partner for Sri Lanka and India.?
Nagao says: ?There is already a Japanese-Sri Lankan project for Maritime Safety Capability Improvement worth approximately 1.8 billion yen or US$ 16.5 million, which includes the provision of two patrol vessels to the Sri Lankan Coast Guard (SLCG).?
?There is also a possibility of Sri Lanka buying patrol planes, the P-3Cs, radars, and sensors to track objects and events in the Indian Ocean,? he adds.
Speaking of the possibility of US, Japan, India and Sri Lanka setting up a maritime communication centre to watch activities in the Indian Ocean, Nagao he says that if this is set up ? it would be easy for the four countries to remain abreast of events in the Indian Ocean.?
Furthermore, if Sri Lanka operates Japan?s P-3C patrol planes, Japan, Sri Lanka, India, and US would be using similar equipment for patrol planes. Therefore, the equipment will present other opportunities for Japan ? Sri Lanka ? India?US co-operation in using and upgrading equipment, and for sharing information collected by the patrol planes, Nagao argues.
Malabar Exercise
Earlier this month, Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, had suggested to the visiting Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremsinghe, that Sri Lanka should join the US-India-Japan Malabar Naval Exercise.
According to Indian sources, Sri Lanka is likely to be an ?observer? in the July 2017 Malabar exercise, and may become a full participant in the next exercise.
Japan is sending its largest warship, the helicopter carrier Izumo for the 2017 exercise ? the first overseas foray for the largest Japanese warship. Significantly, the Izumo will be docking in Colombo en route to India for the Malabar exercise.
However, Sri Lanka has not officially reacted to the invitation to join the Malabar exercise.
Be that as it may, Nagao has suggested the start of a ?Japan-Sri Lanka-India strategic trilateral dialogue to share information, better identify Sri Lanka?s needs, and choose courses of co-operation or support.?
Japan?s Stakes in Sri Lanka
In his latest report to the Pathfinder Foundation, former Sri Lankan navy chief, Adm. Jayanath Colombage, says that analyzing the country of origin of foreign warships visiting the Port of Colombo from 2008 to 2017, it is observed that 65 Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force (MSDF) ships had arrived in Sri Lankan ports, mainly the Port of Colombo.
?This is rather a high number and second only to Indian warships visiting Sri Lanka,? he notes.
Explaining Japan?s interest in Indian Ocean security, Adm. Colombage says that with total dependence on foreign sources for its oil needs and with the sea routes under increasing threat from the Chinese, Japan has become the ?most energy insecure nations? in the world.
??The increased MSDF activities in the Indian Ocean can be attributed to their heavy dependency on crude oil,? Colombage explains.
Japan is not only converting its Self Defense Forces into regular armed forces, but is also suing up political, economic and military alliances with key countries in the in East-West trade route. Japan is currently the most energetic champion of an India-Japan-US-Sri Lanka strategic maritime alliance.
India is Cornerstone
Relations with India are the cornerstone of Japan?s Indian Ocean maritime security policy.
Japan has concluded several security agreements and treaties with India including the ?Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation between Japan and India? in 2008. Japan now participates in several multi-lateral and bi-lateral naval and coast-guard exercises involving India, such as ?Malabar? and ?JIMEX?.
According to Adm.Colombage, Japan initially moved to cultivate Sri Lanka because it considers the Port of Colombo as a convenient transit and rest and recuperation harbor for its counter piracy operations,.
?This is the reason for the visit by a large number of MSDF ships to this port. Japan has now stationed a Defense Attach? in Colombo, who is coordinating visits of MSDF vessels and other military cooperation with Sri Lanka,? he says.
In 2017, for the first time, Japan?s MSDF participated in the ?Pacific Partnership? a multilateral exercise off Hambantota with the participation of military and non-military personnel from the USA, Australia and Sri Lanka.
?This is the 12th year of this exercise and the first time it was conducted in Sri Lanka. The aim of this exercise was to enhance regional cooperation in the fields of medical readiness and preparedness for Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) situations,? Colombage says.
However, others added that the real purpose of the exercise was to test the inter-operability of the participant naval forces.
Japan?s role in Colombo Dockyard Ltd.
Japan has been involved in Sri Lankan shipping for long. The 40 year old Colombo Dockyard Ltd. (CDL), one of the most profitable enterprises in Sri Lanka, is a joint venture between the government of Sri Lanka and Onomichi Dockyard of Kobe, Japan.
In the beginning of 2017, the Sri Lankan Coast Guard (SLCG) placed an order for construction of two 85-meter Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPV) with the CDL to enhance its capabilities in deep sea surveillance. This project will be undertaken by a loan provided by the Japanese government.
??These two OPVs will have the capability to launch and recover helicopters and small utility boats at sea. They will be the biggest ships of the SLCG and will enhance its capability to a higher level,? Colombage says.
?The building of these two OPVs by CDL is also a boost for the local ship building industry in Sri Lanka. The two ships will be based on a European design and SLCG and Sri Lankan Navy marine and electrical engineers and ship building architects will be able to gain valuable practical experience by engaging in this project,? he adds.
Interestingly, Sri Lankan Navy and the Sri Lankan Coast Guard will be able to utilize their experience in countering maritime terrorism in the construction of these two ships, Adm. Colombage notes.
This will be very useful for the naval forces of India, Japan and US which have no direct experience of fighting non-state actors other than pirates. Sri Lanka on the other hand has fought and won against a very efficient, innovative and deadly Tamil Tiger naval force called the ?Sea Tigers?.

Jaipur, (Hindustan Times), Apr 20, 2017 - ?
A group of Kashmiri students at a private university in Rajasthan were on Wednesday allegedly called terrorists and beaten up by locals, upset over soldiers being targeted by stone-throwers in the strife-torn border state. ??
The assault is the latest incident of violence against Kashmiris studying at Chittorgarh?s Mewar University, which has around 500 students from Jammu and Kashmir. ??
?Six of us were assaulted in three separate attacks that took place at the same time in the market. The attacks seemed coordinated,? said Bahar Ahmed Giri, a student of pharmacy. ?
Though no one suffered serious injuries, students are upset with the university administration for failing to protect them and have demanded the arrest of the offenders. ?
They were beaten up for no reason, Giri said. ?They hurled abuses, called us terrorists and said we throw stones at the army. They told us to go back to Kashmir and threatened that they won?t let us study here,? he said. ?

Mastercard unveils credit card with fingerprint sensor
	
?
BBC: A payment card featuring a fingerprint sensor has been unveiled by credit card provider Mastercard.
The rollout follows two successful trials in South Africa. The technology works in the same way as it does with mobile phone payments: users must have their finger over the sensor when making a purchase.
Security experts have said that while using fingerprints is not foolproof, it is a ?sensible? use of biometric technology.
Mastercard?s chief of safety and security, Ajay Bhalla, said that the fingerprint technology would help ?to deliver additional convenience and security. It is not something that can be taken or replicated.?
However, fingerprint sensors can be compromised.
Karsten Nohl, chief scientist at Berlin?s Security Research Labs, told the BBC: ?All I need is a glass or something you have touched in the past.?
He adds that if that information is stolen, ?you only have nine fingerprint changes before you run out of options?.
But Nohl is cautiously optimistic about the technology, saying it is ?better than what we have at the moment?. ?With the combination of chip and PIN, the PIN is the weaker element. Using a fingerprint gets rid of that.?
?Fingerprints have helped us avoid using terrible passwords, and even the most gullible person is not going to cut off their finger if [a criminal] asks nicely.?
The cards are thought to be the first to include both the digital template of the user?s fingerprint and the sensor required to read their fingerprints at the point of sale. Previous biometric payment cards only worked when used in conjunction with a separate fingerprint scanner.
That limited their usefulness, as only stores with the correct equipment could accept them. Having both the data and the scanner on the same card means that they should be accepted everywhere a normal chip and PIN payment card can be used.
But the biometric verification can only be used for in-store purchases: online and other so-called ?card not present? transactions will still require further security measures.

Microsoft rallies finance leaders to embrace future
	
?
Microsoft held a symposium for C-level finance executives at Cinnamon Grand Colombo recently.?
The event which featured keynote speakers and a live demo revealed how Microsoft Power BI, an interactive data visualiser that utilizes predictive-analytics and machine learning, could help CFOs and their finance teams grapple the future.?
?From cloud computing and robotics to analytics and automation, a new class of digital disruptors is transforming how business gets done,? said Tharshini Perera, Group Finance Manager, Microsoft. ?At Microsoft, we?re expecting these disruptors to have a big impact on the way Sri Lankan finance will progress. Therefore, we find it important to create this two-way dialogue now to help our partners achieve more.? ?
Corporations that thrive in this rapidly changing world contrast greatly to the organizations that once dominated the early 1990s. Today, finance leaders give businesses a new competitive edge, and are responsible for delivering business insights across their organizations. Furthermore, the drive toward efficiency will demand more from CFOs and their teams.
Vikram Bakhshi, Senior Finance Director for the Asia Pacific Region tied Microsoft?s mission to engage and empower people to optimize and transform operations. ?Financial departments across many industries are undergoing unprecedented disruption. Technologies like predictive analytics and machine learning are entering the finance mainstream, allowing finance teams to contribute to the business conversation with real-time data driven insights,? he said.
Conducting a demo on Microsoft?s Power BI tool, Gael McLennan, Finance Director Microsoft South East Asia said, ?Data is pervasive and action is elusive. The Power BI dashboard is a cloud-based business analytics service built for non-technical users. With just a browser (any browser) or a Power BI mobile app, finance workers can keep tabs on their business through live operational dashboards. It just takes a moment to load up a dashboard and start interacting with your data.??
Using data-driven insights to help make quick and more informed decisions is increasingly important; Power BI can help finance teams deeply explore their business data with interactive visual reports that drill down into their most important information?and enrich it with additional data sources.?
Reports are built on datasets, while visuals can be pinned to dashboards. In turn, these dashboard visuals are linked back to the reports. The software incorporates predictive-analytics, machine learning, and a view related content feature provides a quick and efficient way to view and jump between those connections. The interface is uncomplicated and constructing a sample dashboard takes little over?
five minutes.
The event concluded with an interactive session for the CFOs and wider audience, initiating a conversation over the benefits Power BI dashboards have across multiple industries to how CFOs can prepare themselves given the future of?

Paris shootout leaves police officer and gunman dead
	
A gunman wielding an assault rifle on Thursday night killed a police officer on Paris?s most iconic boulevard, the Champs-?lys?es, stirring France?s worst fears of a terrorist attack, which could tip voting in a hotly contested presidential election that starts on Sunday.
The gunman was shot dead by the police as he tried to flee on foot; two other police officers and a bystander were wounded. The police quickly blocked access to the crowded thoroughfare, lined with restaurants and high-end stores, as a helicopter hovered overhead.
France
The attack set off panic and a scramble for shelter, and officers began searching for possible accomplices after the attack.
Near midnight, President Fran?ois Hollande said in an address to the nation that the attack appeared to be an act of terrorism. The Islamic State claimed responsibility in a message posted on a jihadi channel, and the Paris prosecutor said he had opened a terrorism investigation.
The attack came only days before the start of a presidential vote that could reverberate across Europe, and as the 11 candidates were having their final quasi-debate on the France 2 television network.
Analysts have been saying for weeks that an attack just before the first vote, or between the first vote and the runoff on May 7, could tip the election toward a candidate perceived as tougher on crime and terrorism, especially the far-right leader Marine Le Pen, who hardened her stand against Muslim immigration in the campaign?s final days, linking it to security fears, or Fran?ois Fillon, who has pledged to eradicate Islamic terrorism.
?Emotion and solidarity for our forces of order, once again targets,? Ms. Le Pen said after the shooting.
The debate format was one-on-one interviews lasting 15 minutes each, followed by an almost three-minute conclusion, and the presidential candidates quickly posted on Twitter posts about the attack. Those whose interviews were still being broadcast took the opportunity to speak about their security proposals.
Mr. Hollande, who spoke from the ?lys?e Palace, offered an emotional tribute to the police, whom he said were the country?s first line of defense, and endeavored to reassure a nervous public.
?It has been the case for a number of months, and we will have absolute vigilance when it comes to the elections,? he said, ?but everyone will understand that at this hour, my thoughts are with the family of the police who were killed and with those close to the wounded policeman.? (nytimes)

Police not the answer to people's protests: JO
	
Police force is not an answer to the protests being held against the dumping of garbage in the suburbs of Colombo, the joint opposition said today while referring to the gazette notice issued by President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday.
The gazette notice made garbage disposal by local government (LG) authorities an essential service, warning that anyone found to be involved in disruptive activities related to garbage disposal, transport and segregation could be arrested even without an arrest warrant.
JO leader and MP Dinesh Gunawardena said it was incorrect to suppress people?s resistance to garbage disposal in their areas in the aftermath of the Meethotamulla disaster.
?People?s fear and resistance is reasonable, given the seriousness of the tragedy that struck Meethotamulla, in which many died. The authorities should realize its sensitive nature and work closely with the people's representatives in this situation. Deploying police is not what they should do,? he said.
The MP said garbage disposal had become an issue as the government keeps delaying LG elections. ?There are no people's representatives at LG bodies to tackle this menace. Officers alone can?t solve this crisis,? he said.
When asked about politically motivated protests, the MP said there could be a few such incidents which cannot be generalized. ?Fears of the people are genuine and cannot be ignored,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Ranil to visit India
	
Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremsinghe will visit India next week to set the agenda for Prime Minister Narendra Modi?s trip to Colombo in May.
?The visit of the PM of Sri Lanka to India from April 25 is part of our continuing engagement with the Government of Sri Lanka at the highest level,? an MEA spokesperson said, announcing the visit.
Officials said an MoU to develop Trincomalee port?s prospects through operating a major oil-storage facility, LNG plant and piped-gas projects and developing it as a key transit point with major expressways and industrial zones in the region is in the final stages of negotiations.
The two sides will also hold discussions on the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA), a version of the free trade agreement, and will be taken forward during Mr. Modi?s visit for International Vesak Day, the annual Buddhist festival on May 12, officials told The Hindu.
Mr. Wickremsinghe, who frequently travels to India, is understood to be visiting India for a private visit from April 25 to 29, to attend a wedding, but will spend April 26 in Delhi for official meetings.
Mr. Modi will host a lunch for him.
External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari will call on him, officials said.
Mr. Wickremesinghe?s visit is also significant as it comes a few weeks before his trip to Beijing to attend the Belt and Road Summit, that Sri Lanka has joined.
While Chinese companies have already clinched many important infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka, including the Hambantota and Colombo port development projects, India is hopeful of more projects in the North and the East of the island.
Apart from the economic agenda, Mr. Wickremsinghe is expected to discuss the ongoing dispute over fishing rights in the Palk Strait with Ms. Swaraj.
Despite several rounds of negotiations between the fishing communities of the two countries, Indian fishermen continue to be apprehended by the Sri Lankan Navy for trespassing in their waters.
In the latest case in early April, six men claiming to be fishermen were also arrested for smuggling drugs by Sri Lankan forces, the latest flashpoint in the series of arrests that saw 10 men arrested on March 21, and 12 arrested on March 25. (Hindu)

Secrets that the fingers reveal
	
By A.S. Fernando
Fingers are the most important and the most active part of the hand. Palmistry ?attaches great significance to the fingers.
We all know that there are four fingers and the thumb on human hand.
The four fingers are described as Index Finger or the Finger of Jupiter, Finger of Saturn, Finger of Apollo or the Finger of the Sun and Little Finger or the Finger of Mercury and they are also referred to as the First Finger, the Second Finger, the Third Finger or Ring Finger and the Fourth Finger respectively.?
Index Finger or the Finger of Jupiter?
Index Finger or the Finger of Jupiter: The finger next to the thumb is the Index Finger. This finger is not always straight. It leans to a side very often. You can ascertain to which side this finger leans by examining the tip of this finger in relation to the tips of other fingers. Some Index Fingers are straight while others lean either towards the Finger of the Saturn or the thumb.
?
Finger of Saturn
This is the middle finger, the longest one. It is seldom that one would find the Finger of Saturn and the Index Finger is of equal length. Those with these two fingers of equal length would either commit suicide or die due to an unusual cause.
?
Finger of Apollo
The finger next to the Finger of Saturn is called the Finger of Apollo. Usually this finger is shorter than the Finger of Saturn; in length it is almost equal to the Finger of Jupiter. Leaning of this finger too reveals a secret. If it is leaning towards the Finger of Saturn, the owner of the hand is a very fortunate person. If it leans towards the little Finger (Finger of Mercury), the owner?s family life is not happy.
?
Finger of Mercury (Little finger)
This is the smallest finger on the hand. Usually this finger reaches the upper flange of the Apollo finger. If this is unusually long, the owner is very fortunate and he would attain a high position by dint of perseverance.
?
Fingers named after the mounts at the base
The fingers are named after the mounts located under them. For example, the Mount of Jupiter is located under the Index Finger or the Finger of Jupiter.
If you are a student of palmistry, you are advised to observe whether one?s fingers are short or long and whether they are close together at the base or are widely spaced between them. If the space between one?s thumb and the Finger of Apollo is very wide, one is very generous. He is a lover of freedom and independence. If the Fingers of Jupiter and Saturn widely separate, the owner is not conventional in his views. His behavior and actions would be unorthodox.
When the fingers of Saturn and Apollo are far apart, the owner is a person who lives for the day with no concern for tomorrow. Such people are spendthrifts. Widely separated fingers of Apollo and Mercury indicate that the owner is very independent in his thinking. He would not care about what others think?about him.
You can get easily acquainted with persons with widely separated fingers. They are friendly and sociable by nature. People whose fingers are close together are unsociable, stingy, self-centered and are slaves to formality and convention. They would usually look on others?
with suspicion.

Separate ward for dengue patients: Rajitha
	
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne today directed the setting up of a separate ward for dengue patients at hospitals countrywide.
He said he had arrived at this decision after a meeting with the heads of several ministries.
?At present we send dengue patients to the Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) in Angoda and the Negombo General Hospital for treatment, but a separate ward for dengue patients is essential at every hospital,? he said.
He said hospitals should at least have separate beds for dengue patients even if they lacked enough facilities to provide a separate ward.
He said the parents of schoolchildren should help clean the school premises before the end of the April vacation and eradicate dengue breeding sites and government institutions should follow this.
?Construction sites should also be kept clean since the possibility of the dengue mosquito breeding in such places is considerably high. We cancel their licenses for one month if mosquito breeding sites are found there. It is also necessary to keep fishery harbours clean,? he said.
He said steps have been taken to destroy abandoned fishing boats and that officials attached to the environmental police and Public Health Inspectors (PHI) have been assigned to detect mosquito sites. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

UDA says fee for collecting garbage worth a try
	
A fee being levied from the people by the relevant local government (LG) bodies for the collection of their garbage might bring about a positive change in attitude among the population, Chairman of the Urban Development Authority (UDA) Dr. Jagath Munasinghe said today.
When asked by Daily Mirror, whether the UDA was planning to make a proposal to impose a fee for collecting garbage from each household, Dr. Munasinghe said it was up to the LG bodies to make a decision in this regard.
?It?s the Urban Councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas which possess the legal authority to collect taxes. If households are to be charged for collecting garbage, these bodies should make a decision. However, we can and will help them if they decide to implement such a move,? he said.
LG bodies which are struggling in terms of revenue could make use of the funds collected by imposing such a charge, Dr. Munasinghe said.
He said with the increase of GDP, consumption also increases. ?This is an issue in developing countries like ours. When the GDP increases, consumption increases as well. Therefore, a charge is not an unfair move,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
