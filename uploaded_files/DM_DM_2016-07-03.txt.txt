Animal hunters arrested; main suspect surrenders
	
Six hunters, including the main suspect, were arrested today in Panwila, Kandy in connection with hunting wild animals in the Knuckles Conservation Forest, following uproar on social media over the incident.
Pictures of hunters with meat of various wild animals went viral on social media last week creating a massive uproar among the public.
According to initial reports one of the hunters is said to be an Estate Superintendant, and the rest are also said to be hailing from affluent backgrounds.
The hunters were accused of killing animals including deer and porcupines considered endangered animals in the Wildlife Conservation Act.
The preliminary investigations launched by the Wildlife Conservation Department officials and the Panwila Police have found that the hunting activities as pictured had taken place five years ago.
Following police investigations, two men had been arrested in St. Johns Estate, Madolkele. One had escaped.
The main suspect and three others had surrendered to the Panwila Police with their lawyer.
Three firearms were also found in the possession of the hunters who are residents of Nawala and Panwila.
The suspects are in the ages of 20, 22, 28, 30, 33 and 42 were to be produced in the Theldeniya Magistrates Court in due course, police said.
Wildlife Conservation Department Acting Director General W.K. Pathirathna said a group of Department officers were also involved in the investigations with the police.
He said the suspects had surrendered not to the police but to the Wildlife Departments Office in Randenigala where they were sent to the police later.
Meanwhile, sources said that some interested parties were interfering in the case and attempts are being made to sweep the case under the carpet. (Chamil Rupasinghe and Nadeeka Daya Bandara)

Bus strike called off following MS assurance: Unions
	
The island wide private bus strike which was scheduled from midnight tonight has been called off, the All Island Private Bus Company Federation (AIPBCF) said.
Several private bus owner unions had earlier called an islandwide strike, scheduled to commence midnight today over the revision of fares.
The unions demanded a 15 percent bus fare increase.
AIPBCF General Secretary Anjana Priyanjith said the members of the unions had met President Maithripala Sirisena this morning and had discussed the matter. 
We called off the strike after the President assured that he would look into the matter within three days, he said.
The Lanka Private Bus Owners Association (LPBOA) Chairman Gemunu Wijeratne said the unions agreed to call off the strike as the discussion held with President was successful.
The President acknowledged that bus fares should be revised, he said.
Mr. Wijeratne said another meeting would be held next week with President, the Prime Minister and the Transport Minister.

England trashes Sri Lanka to seal 3-0 win
	
England completed a 3-0 series win over Sri Lanka with a 122-run victory in the fifth one-day international at Cardiff.
Joe Root struck a measured 93 and helped England to 324-7, sharing a 109-run stand with Jos Buttler, who made 70 off 45 balls.
David Willey took 4-34 and Liam Plunkett 3-44 to help Sri Lanka out for 202 with 7.2 overs unused.
Sri Lanka are still without a win against England on this tour, with only Tuesday's Twenty20 remaining.
England move above Sri Lanka to fifth in the International Cricket Council rankings, and look a different side to the one that exited last year's World Cup at the group stages.
James Vince, who struggled in the Test series against the same opposition, did well to make a maiden ODI half-century but threw his wicket away when trying to cut loose off the spin of Danushka Gunathilaka, who took 3-48.
In the run chase, Gunathilaka's 48 proved useful after some early wickets, but after his dismissal to Plunkett only Dinesh Chandimal could provide some resistance with 53 until he was bowled by Willey.
On a pitch that had looked to favour seam bowling, spinner Adil Rashid picked up 2-41 in 10 overs, and Willey returned late on with two 41st-over wickets before sealing victory in his next.(BBC)

The Inter-University Students Federation and University Students' Union of Jayewardenepura University launched a massive protest today over an incident that had taken place on Saturday night where a thief had allegedly entered a girls hostel.
Sources said this most unpleasant incident took place at a girls hostel of the Jayewardenepura University Arts Faculty, which was occupied by sophomores.
Meanwhile, University Students Union President Prabath Chaturanga said a thief had entered the girls hostel, a four storey building occupied by more than 300 students, on Saturday and stolen eight mobile phones.
The thief had entered the hostel which is located outside the University premises through the broken doors and windows that did not have latches. However, when a girl who was disturbed by her sleep suddenly woke up in the middle of the night and noticed him, he had immediately resorted to escape, he said adding that the only female security officer who was on duty that day failed to catch him because she had been in deep sleep.
He claimed that they were protesting in order to urge the relevant authorities to ensure the security of the female students by taking necessary actions. Sources said the students of the university lodged a complaint with the police regarding this issue.
However, it is reported that no girl was harassed or injured by the thief. (Piyumi Fonseka)

The Colombo Chief Magistrates Court on Friday gave an order over the inquiry conducted against the film, Adaraneeya Kathawak which is now being screened, for allegedly violating the National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol Act by displaying Tobacco or Alcohol trade marks in the film.
Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris ordered the film's Director Priyantha Colombage, National Film Corporation Chairman and Majestic Cinema Manager to provide a full length version CD of the movie to the Narahenpita Police in order to observe scenes allegedly promoting Tobacco or alcohol by violating the section 35 of the National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol Act.

Representing the National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol Department, Dilishiya Abeynayake had lodged a complaint with the Narahenpita police over the violation of the Act stating that the Authority had observed scenes in the film, in which Tobacco or alcohol advertisements were included by displaying trade marks of some brands.
The complainant told police that the Authority had found more than ten scenes of promoting Tobacco or alcohol in the film.

Will join up with TNA or JVP for betterment of country: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today said the desire of the present government is to ally with any political party including the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) or Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) for the betterment of the country.
Speaking during the United National Party (UNP) membership drive in Badulla, Mr Wickremesinghe said others will go against the government if one party tries to implement development work on its own.
We have formed a national government to ally with everyone to prevent anyone from going against us. All partners in a national government have the ability to share both good and bad, he added.
Ministers Nimal Siripala de Silva and Harin Fernando have got into the same cabinet after being logger heads with each other in the past. Our desire is to bring all political opponents together, he further said.
Some question us on our performance during the first year in office. We did not take over a Singapore or a Dubai but a land which is rampant with theft and corruption. This land was isolated and was perceived to be a land of murderers. But now the world had taken a positive turn towards Sri Lanka thanks to Minister of Foreign Affairs Mangala Samaraweera, he added.
Further, he said a new sophisticated generation should take over UNP. Those sophisticated people who work with mobile phones and lap top computers should take over the party, he said.
The Prime Minister pledged to make Mattala Airport active with a movement of 50 aircraft from it daily. He pledged to develop the tourism industry.  A vast tourism zone will be set up by merging Hambantota, Galle, Arugam Bay and Badulla, he said
Minister of Digital Technology Infrastructure Development Harin Fernando who also spoke during the membership drive programme pledged to provide tabs for the youth in Badulla. (Palitha Ariyawansa, Yohan Perera and Prasard Rukmal)
