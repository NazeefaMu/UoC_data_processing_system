Rakna Lanka armoury sealed
	
The armoury of the Rakna Lanka Security Service affiliated to the Defence Ministry has been sealed following complaints to the police that the weapons belonging to the Security Service had been used illegally during the just concluded Presidential election.
A senior police officer said the armoury situated within the BMICH premises would be checked on Monday after a court order is secured. He added the armoury was sealed after the Anti-Corruption Organization which had been formed by several organizations including the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) lodged complaints that the weapons from this armoury had been used for election violence.
He added that documents belonging to the security service were being checked by a special police team.
The Rakna Lanka Security service was formed under a special gazette notification to provide security for institutions under the Defence Ministry.
Meanwhile four containers containing goods believed to have been imported through the Rakna Lanka Security Service to distribute among voters during the Presidential elections were also sealed yesterday. They were sealed after police received information that several suspicious looking containers had been parked in the BMICH vehicle park.(Indika Rmanayake and Bimal Syaman Jayasinghe)

Dynastic rule helped war victory: Namal
	
MP Namal Rajapaksa in an interview to NDTV has said that his family's dynastic rule led to the military victory over the LTTE.
He said the close knit ties between his father and his uncle, the Defence Secretary, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, was responsible for Lanka's military victory over the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam or LTTE.
"The war was ended because of this bond within the family," Namal said at the office of his law firm in the heart of Colombo. "Any leader needs someone they can trust as secretary of defence. My father was able to take strong decisions as an individual along with the leaders of the government but the leader needs someone they can trust," he added.
When asked whether this was a feudal argument in a modern democracy, where an elected leader needs to trust their colleagues regardless of family affiliations, Namal said, "We always trusted each other, but can I ask you is it a crime that I became the President's son?"
The new government has filed a criminal case, alleging that in the early hours of January 9, when it became clear Mr Rajapaksa was losing the election, he called a secret meeting at his residence attended by top officials to plot the declaration of Emergency in Sri Lanka.
Namal denied any such meeting, but acknowledged that officials may have come to see him.
"Various people came to speak to him right throughout the night. It's normal at the end of the election, the government officials always come and talk."
