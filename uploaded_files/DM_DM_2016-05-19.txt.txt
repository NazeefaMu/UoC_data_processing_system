Cooperation is the need of the hour: PM
	
Addressing a media briefing at the Temple Trees today, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe warned that prevalent inclement weather conditions would prolong for some time, and said cooperation was the need of the hour.
He urged all people and forces to extend a helping hand to save the lives of those affected by floods.
Our priority is to save the lives of those who have been affected by the prevalent weather conditions.
We cannot expect the inclement weather to return to normalcy as more rain clouds were expected to arrive from the Maldives. More landslides like the ones that occurred in Aranayake could take place in other areas as well, and those who have been advised to leave their homes, please do so, he said.
The premier stated that security forces and the police would be deployed to all flood affected areas on the instructions of protecting the belongings of the displaced and the ones who were evacuated.
Some people have been reluctant to leave their premises when they have been asked to, assuming that their valuables would be robbed. But, the police and security forces have been deployed to prevent such happenings. A survey done on the situation in Colombo and Gampaha areas stated that the floods were unusual. I have personally witnessed floods in the Gampaha area since 1975, but this time, the region is inundated like never before, he lamented.
Responding to a question raised by a journalist as to whether an emergency situation would be declared, the Prime Minister said such a move was not needed as only certain parts of the country were affected.
Meanwhile, Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa who was also present at the briefing said a special insurance scheme had been introduced to assist the flood affected people. He said a colossal sum of Rs. 300 million had been allocated for it, and added that the funds would be spent without considering any circular.
While further pointing out that some 414, 627 people belonging to 98, 076 families have been affected thus far, Minister Yapa said the floods have claimed 43 lives, and 16 persons had gone missing.
As many as 286 houses have been destroyed while 3, 057 were partly damaged. Meanwhile, some 61, 381 families have been put up in 594 camps, he said. (Yohan Perera)

Jayalalithaa elected as Chief Minister again
	
For the first time in 32 years, Tamil Nadu has chosen to give a consecutive term to one party - Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa will remain exactly where she is, according to clear trends from counting.
There were "no words in the dictionary," Ms Jayalalithaa said to describe her gratitude to the people of the state. "I have no other interest in life except to work for the people of Tamil Nadu," the reclusive Chief Minister added.
Celebrations were raucous outside her home in Chennai today with supporters declaring victory by 9.30 am.
Most exit polls had predicted that the 67-year-old's arch rival, M Karunanidhi, and his DMK would return to power in a continuum of the "yo-yo trend" of which Tamil Nadu has been a long-time subscriber.
But as counting of votes accelerated, the leaders who were seen walking into Mr Karunanidhi's home refused to comment on camera, indicating an acceptance of defeat.
Mr. Karunanidhi is 93, and in a wheelchair, but had committed to serving as Chief Minister if the DMK was elected, an announcement which caused considerable heartache for his son, MK Stalin and his considerable supporters.
Ahead of the election, Jayalalithaa promised to gift voters cell phones and other freebies - her last election campaign five years ago pledged mixer-grinders to housewives. Her Amma canteens, which provide highly subsidized food, have been a runaway success.
Last year, she was acquitted of corruption charges by a court in Bengaluru, but the Karnataka government has challenged that verdict in the Supreme Court.
Counting took place today in 232 of 234 constituencies in Tamil Nadu after polling was postponed in two constituencies - Aravakurichi and Thanjavur - due to reports of distribution of large amounts of money to buy votes. (NDTV)

Issuing a statement on the seventh anniversary of the end of the war in Sri Lanka, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said a robust accountability mechanism with foreign involvement was needed to enlist the confidence of war victims.
Today, we mark the anniversary of the end of the war in Sri Lanka in 2009. It is a time to honour, remember, and reflect on the victims of this 26-year war.
Over the past seven years, I have met many victims of this war, and have been deeply moved by their heroic stories of trauma and loss. Much work lies ahead to heal the wounds of all those who have suffered, and to achieve long-term peace and reconciliation on the island.
Tamil-Canadians are an integral part of our country and have overcome much adversity. I extend my deepest sympathy and support to Canadians of Tamil descent.
I am encouraged that the Sri Lankan government is committed to working with the United Nations Human Rights Council and the international community towards seeking accountability in their country. A robust accountability mechanism must enlist the confidence of the victims of this war, through the meaningful engagement of foreign and Commonwealth investigators, prosecutors, and judges. Canada will continue to engage the international community in investigating and addressing serious violations of international law in Sri Lanka and around the world. We stand willing to assist the government of Sri Lanka in fulfilling this commitment, he said.
