Budget 2017 was an outcome of UNP policies: JO
	
The Joint Opposition today said the Budget 2017 was an outcome of United National Party (UNP) policies but not from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP)s, even though the Yahapalana Government claimed to be a combination of both parties.
Addressing a media briefing, Joint Opposition member MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage said the policies such as privatization of state resources and burdening people with taxes were the concepts and economic structures included in the UNP political views.
The budget proposal made on last Thursday was the final budget of this government. This is the final phase of the Yahapalana Government. They would not be able to rule the country any longer since the people had lost their faith in the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister with their actions, he added.
Meanwhile, addressing the media briefing, Joint Opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa said the government would be toppled in the near future with the change of the peoples attitude towards the government.
He said the people would be against the government similar to the way the Sri Lankans turned over the British rule in 1818 and added that the main reason for it would be the unbearable taxes and proposals included in the Budget 2017; There is no body to govern this country and the government is in a mess, he added.

Budget 2017 will shrink, not expand the economy: JHU
	
The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) said today the 2017 budget was a frugal budget which would shrink the economic process instead of expanding it.
JHU National Organiser Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said proposals had been made to control the income and expenditure in the budget even though Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake claimed that it would be a revolutionary budget.
We expected considerable amount of funds would be allocated for innovations from the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). We do not see any constructive steps had been taken to develop the economy. This budget would not expand the economy, he said.
He said even though the government expected an economic growth of 7 per cent, it had not formulated any action plan to achieve that target.
There are no plans to develop the agricultural sector or livestock in the budget, he said.
Mr. Warnasinghe said they did not approve of the governments proposal to give tab computers to A/L students and teachers without seeking expertise advice on the decision.
Most of the students already use smart phones which come with lot of options such as internet facilities but we need to find out how far they utilise it for their education purposes. There is no follow up action had been proposed to monitor how the students use the tabs for educational purposes, he said.
He said the government had got the priorities mixed up and added that it should have formulated a mechanism to utilise the computer facilities which had been provided to schools.
There are 4000 computers at the Sri Jayawardene University and most of other schools had been provided with computers but there is no mechanism to monitor whether they are used effectively, he said.
He said the government had imposed a 20% tax on internet facilities while proposing to provide tabs and asked whether the students would be provided internet facilities free of charge. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Construction of express ways in the hill country is not advisable due to environmental reasons, government MP Ven. Athuraliye Ratana Thera told Parliament today.
Ven. Thera, who was speaking during the debate on the second reading of the budget said express ways in the hill country could result in natural disasters. A major disaster can happen in the event of a flood as express ways will convert hill country into a highly populated area" he said.
An express way was built along the slopes of Kathmandu in Nepal making the area highly populated. A major flood which occurred in the area destroyed a large number of human lives" he added.
Construction of some express ways including the Central express ways had been proposed in the budget but I believe these could be amended through a dialogue" he further said. (Yohan Perera)

He strikes pay dirt the illicit way
	

A departmental head connected to the countrys defense establishment has struck it rich!

His sudden fortune has come up from a gem-rich gravel deposit lying beneath a streambed. The stream, a tributary of Kelani River is one running through the Dompe area, they say.
The tons of gemstone bearing gravel dug out from the streambed by using heavy machinery is being dumped on a land owned by the departmental head and the khaki-clad tribe, though well aware of the activity going on day and night, has turned a blind eye for fear of reprisals, informed sources say.
The men and women in the department who discuss this illicit gem mining exercise in hushed tones say: Our Lokka lectures to us for hours on end on the need to enforce the law to the letter. But this is the example he has set!

There is a top team member in yahapalanaya who sat at the top table under the previous regime as well. He has his own political party with about three members representing it in the Diyawanna council.

Many frowned on the kind of activity in which he was engaged in the area North of Puttalam, but he carried on regardless. Now he is said to be casting his covetous eye on the East as well.
By the way, this one had to appear before the FCID several times in the recent past to account for some of his doings during the past regime and he had been quizzed for hours on end on certain occasions. He is said to be highly dejected over being subjected to this humiliation despite being an important member of the top team and a party leader to boot.
The poor man had an opportunity recently to pour out his heavy heart to his long-standing friend, the clever sibling once the power behind the throne. Meanwhile, the former strongman has advised him to stay put until the new political alignment takes some definite form and shape.
So the unhappy politico these days is just marking time with a soul full of hope, they say.

India to use indelible ink to ensure people change cash only once
	
REUTERS: Indian banks will use indelible ink to ensure that people only change old notes for new ones once under Prime Minister Narendra Modis scheme to fight black money, resorting to a tactic used to prevent multiple voting in elections.
The step comes a week after Modi ordered the withdrawal of large denomination banknotes from circulation, in a shock demonetisation drive to fight tax evasion, corruption and forgery.
The government only gave people a few hours notice before the old 500 and 1,000 rupee banknotes - which accounted for 86 percent of cash in circulation - were cancelled. The sudden move has caused huge disruption to daily life, especially for poor people who live in the cash economy.
A top finance ministry official said the use of indelible ink - also used to stop multiple voting in Indian elections - would prevent unscrupulous persons from sending people from one bank branch to the next to exchange old notes.
Individuals are only allowed to swap 4,500 rupees (US $ 66.50) once. You find the same people coming back again and again, Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das told a briefing, saying huge queues were preventing honest people from getting the cash they need. Campaigning to win power in 2014, Modi had pledged to flush out corruption by forcing people to bring their hidden money back into the system.
And with an important state election just months away, he is again campaigning to justify the demonetisation drive.
After demonetisation, the poor are enjoying a sound sleep while rich are running from pillar to post to buy sleeping pills, he told a rally on Monday in Uttar Pradesh, which goes to the polls next spring.

Political and media bigwigs of the country had been invited to this function.
The big boss of yahapalanaya breezed in when the party was underway. Several top team members who were awaiting his arrival moved over to the table where their boss sat. The former madam who arrived soon after took a seat at the same table. They all expected the Big Two to get into an animated conversation and were keen to hear what they were to discuss. But hardly a word was exchanged among them for about 45 minutes.
At long last, the former madam broke the ice by making a reference to a flower-bud political party.
Some people who observed the scene agreed later that something had gone awry.

Long distance buses to strike if minimum fine not reduced
	
Inter-Provincial Private Bus Association (IPPBA) today said it they would definitely go on a countrywide bus strike, if the Finance Minister failed to provide a reasonable solution to the proposed increase in the minimum penalty of Rs.2,500 for traffic offences.
While addressing media in Narahenpita today, the President of the IPPBA Sarath Vijitha Kumara said Minister Ravi Karunanayake should revise the minimum penalty of Rs.2, 500 for traffic offences proposed in the budget, after discussions with the IPPBA.
It is not fair to increase the minimum offence of Rs. 20 to Rs.2,500. If the minimum fine minimum for an offence is increased that much, we can realize how much will going to be charged for other offences, he said.
However, it is fair to impose such fines for drunken drivers, he said.
Bus drivers are not the only killers on the road. If they do so, it is a result of current road. We dont need to have a discussion after a strike. Our association is not taking decisions as Gemunu Wijeratnes bus association. We always try to take decision only after discussions to minimalize the damage to the country, he said.
Mr. Kumara said increasing the minimum offence was not reasonable. It could only be applicable after providing proper infrastructures.
Traffic Police personnel are not 100 percent law abiding to impose such penalties. It will be a paradise to the Traffic Police, he charged
Finally, the IPPBA urged President Maithripala Sirisena to take action to scrap the penalty hike and revise the fine at a reasonable point. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

The minimum fine of Rs. 2,500 was intended for driving under the influence of liquor and driving without driving licence, Cabinet Co-Spokesman Gayantha Karunathilaka said today.
Addressing media at the weekly Cabinet briefing at the Parliament Complex Minister Karunathilaka said the minimum fine proposed in the budget presented by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake targeted those who drove under the influence of liquor and those drove without a licence.
However, there is an increment of road accidents at least 10 per day, which has come to the level of road terrorism, he said.
The decision was taken to reduce the number of accidents and protect the people, he said.
Now the question is that, whether the penalty of minimum fine was reasonable or not, the Minister said.
These offences will not come into operation until the budget is passed in Parliament, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

More details on the government's move to privatise Central Bank's function of monitoring financial institutions will be unveiled to the people soon, former President and joint opposition MP Mahinda Rajapaksa told Parliament today.
Speaking during the debate on the second reading of the budget said this move will take the power of the House on State finances away. He reminded that the power on State finance is vested with Parliament under Section 146 of the Constitution.
The function of monitoring of the Central Bank is going to be handed over to a company owned by the personal friends of key government officials" he said.
Mr Rajapaksa said the present UNP led government is slated to implement the 'regaining Sri Lanka' programme once again and privatise State properties." What the 2002 UNP government did was to sell State properties. It is sad to see a section of SLFP joining the UNP in carrying out this exercise" he said.
He said true SLFPers should work according to their conscience and uphold the party's policies.
He added that giving 15,000 acres in Hambantota District to foreigners is a dangerous move. It will create a foreign economic colony," he said.
Mr Rajapaksa said the government is harping on the borrowings of the previous regime while doing the same thing.
The government has acted like a Grade 2 student by getting into a dispute with China with regard to borrowings," Mr Rajapaksa added. (Yohan Perera)

Investigations were ongoing to arrest a Maldivian who is also largely involved in the racket by making preparations in Maldives.
When informed by the Daily Mirror, an official from the Maldives Embassy said they were unaware of the incident until then but assured that Maldives High Commissioner of Sri Lanka Zahiya Zareer would be informed soon to look into the matter adding that they would decide whether to work together with authorities in Sri Lanka in support to the ongoing probe.

Paying high rent for an unused building and vehicle park
	

It made sensational news when certain authorities took out a lease on a building for a hefty monthly rent of some Rs.290 million to house a high office handling the countrys agriculture. They also had paid the film star owning the building a large sum of money as an advance payment as well. 

The authorities who had negotiated this lease transaction had failed to foresee the need of space for vehicle parking, which is not available in the premises taken on lease. As a result, they had had to acquire on rent an adjoining bloc of land to be as the vehicle park at an additional cost of Rs.3. 5 million a month. However, the story does not end here.
The high office, for housing which the building was acquired at such a massive cost is yet to be moved into the new premises for want of adequate floor space in it, they say. Although the high office is yet to shift into the new building, the monthly rent for the building and the vehicle park continue as per the agreements, they say.

Rupee eases on importer dlr demand
	
REUTERS: The Sri Lankan rupee was slightly weaker yesterday on importer dollar demand and in line with declines in emerging market currencies that fell on investor fears that higher US interest rates under incoming President Donald Trump would spark capital outflows from those markets.
The weakness in the rupee also followed Sri Lankas budget proposals on Thursday to revise corporate and withholding taxes to boost revenue and cut the 2017 fiscal deficit to 4.6 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) from this years 5.4 percent.
Dealers also said a high-tax regime could put some pressure on the rupee.
Rupee forwards were active, with spot-next forwards trading at 148.30/50 per dollar at 0526 GMT, compared with Fridays close of 148.00/10. One-week forwards were at 148.50/65 per dollar, weaker from Fridays close of 148.20/30.
Markets were closed on Monday for a Buddhist religious holiday.
The importer demand is there after the long weekend, a currency dealer said requesting anonymity.
Globally, the dollar is strengthening.
The US dollar hovered near a 14-year high yesterday and Treasury yields extended their rise as investors braced for higher inflation in the United States amid expectations of fiscally expansionary polices under Donald Trumps presidency.

Sanasa September quarter profit falls as margins come under pressure
	
Sanasa Development Bank PLC (Sanasa), microfinancier turned licensed commercial bank, saw its net profit for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 (3Q16) falling by 70 percent from a year ago to Rs.49.2 million or Rs.1.22 a share, as the bank felt the brunt of squeezing margins, the interim results filed with the Colombo bourse showed.
The net interest income (NII) declined by 7 percent from a year ago to Rs.781 million as the rise in interest expense outweighed the rise in the interest income.
This pushed the net interest margin to fall to 5.65 percent from 7.13 percent at the start of the year. Sanasa is a key financial institution in the country, which has been strengthening the rural economy for decades by providing financial support to less privileged institutions and entities in society. The bank is backed by nearly 8,000 co-operative societies with over a million members.
However, in recent times, the bank has been shifting its focus from microfinance to small and medium enterprise (SME) finance in a bid to diversify its portfolio, which may have taken a toll on its margins.
In 2015, the bank also obtained the advisory services from the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector investment arm of the World Bank, to assist them in technical processes and internal restructuring in their shift toward SME-focused banking.
The bank grew its loan book by 14 percent or by Rs.6.6 billion during the nine months to September. The bank now has a loan book slightly in excess of Rs.52.4 billion.
The bank also has an asset base of Rs.65 billion, which is an 8.0 percent increase from December 31, 2015. However, the growth in deposits has been extremely slow as the deposit growth during the same period was only Rs.2.5 billion. The bank in December 2015 raised Rs.4.0 billion in a listed debenture issue. Sanasa has a core-capital base of Rs.5.1 billion but the minimum capital requirement for a licensed commercial bank is Rs.10.0 billion.
The banks Tier II capital adequacy ratio stood at 11.71 percent, little above the regulatory minimum of 10.0 percent.
Meanwhile, the provisions made for possible loan losses during the quarter increased to Rs.38.9 million from a provision reversal of Rs.4.2 million a year ago.
The gross non-performing loan ratio was at 2.42 percent, slightly up from 2.37 percent in December 2015 but below the industry average of 3.0 percent. 
Meanwhile, during the nine months to September 30, the bank made a net profit of Rs.245.9 million or Rs.5.85 a share, 58 percent less than a year ago.
The NII fell by 4.0 percent year-on-year to Rs.2.4 billion.
As at September 30, high-net-worth investor Dr. T. Senthilverl held 12.77 percent, while Global Rubber Industries (Pvt.) Ltd held a 10.47 percent stake in the bank.

## Title: TV set was not duty-free

TV set was not duty-free
	

A deputy one in yahapalanaya hailing from the Gampaha district, on his return after a brief visit abroad bought a large-size TV set from a duty-free shop at the Katunayake airport.

As the deputy one, incidentally a prominent crusader against corruption, was back after a short sojourn abroad; his duty-free allowance was a meagre US$180. But the TV set had cost US$990. He had, however, faced no problem about getting Customs clearance because he walked out of the airport through the VIPs exit with the TV set.
Back at home, the deputy one found to his chagrin that he could not operate the TV set due to some defects. He immediately got his private secretary to speak to the duty-free shop manager and the latter agreed to issue another TV set in place of the defective set.
The Deputys aides had taken the TV set to the duty-free shop at the airport and were returning through the normal passage when the Customs officers challenged them. The deputys aides explained that they were taking away a TV set exchanged for one already taken home by their boss.
Asked to produce the Customs clearance documents, they explained that the need to pay duty had not arisen. The Customs officers then told them that it did not matter to them whether their boss was a deputy or someone even higher, the tax due on the TV set purchased should be paid and had proceeded to slap a tax and a fine amounting to Rs.60,000 on the Deputy and a fine of Rs.20,000 on the shop that sold the set. The deputys aides had told the Customs officers that they did not carry enough money to pay the tax plus the fine. A hot argument had ensued and finally the duty-free shop owner had agreed to pay the total amount of Rs.80,000  tax payments plus fines-slapped on both.
The Customs had released the TV set on taxes and fines being paid by the duty-free shop owner.
