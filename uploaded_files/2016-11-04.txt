A Chinese Merchant Group will be given 50 square kilometres of land in the South for industrialization, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today at the 15th Asia Pacific Conference of German Business held at the Hong Kong Exhibition and Convention Centre.
?This is exactly what Japan did in Thailand and in Malaysia" he said.
The Prime Minister expressed similar sentiments at the working breakfast with German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel at the Grand Hyatt Hotel.
?The China-Japan-Korea Trade agreement and the economic agreement of ASEAN countries are on the cards while Australia and New Zealand are also integrating more with Asia," he said and added that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had pioneered trade agreements with countries in the Bay of Bengal region.
Premier Wickremesinghe said these developments were taking place amid unrest in the Korean Peninsula and in the South China Sea.
?What is important for Sri Lanka are Asian trade agreements and trade agreements with other parts of the world," he said and added that the Sri Lankan Government was focusing on the manufacturing sector as well.
"Earlier we focused on infrastructure development but now we have integrated the manufacturing sector together with infrastructure development," the Prime Minister said. "We have embarked on developing WiFi zones across the country. We need of engineers especially in the IT sector and IT training institutions as well," the Prime Minister said. "China is coming in with its one gate one way system while Japan too is coming in with trade agreements. China and Japan have the funds." He said each country would have to decide how they were going to deal with the development in Asia.
German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel stressed the need for finding ways and means to fit Europe into the changes in the global trade. "The Asia Pacific Region will drive the global trade in the future," he said stressed the need for Europe remove trade obstacles. (Yohan Perera in Hong Kong)

His voice will continue to echo in our ears: President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena issuing a condolence message over the demise of Pandit W.D. Amaradeva said that the nation is stricken by the demise of great maestro who belonged to the generation of pioneers.
?The country is indebted to him for the exceptional service he rendered to us by exploring the roots of local music to enrich it to an unprecedented high.
Maestro Amaradeva reached pinnacle of Sinhala music and brought our nation to fame. He was a true genius, blessed with innate wisdom refined in the school of life, and perfected by the association of scholars of language the arts and philosophy. Above all, his was the voice of the deep- seated Sinhala cultural self.
The two songs ?sasara wasana thuru and ?rathnadeepa janma bhumi? suffice to distinguish the eminence of maestro Amaradeva. Though he has left us today after his magnificent contribution to the nations the aura of his oeuvre will kindle and inspire us forever.
He was also the embodiment of simplicity and contentment in life. Although the voice that awakened a nation has been silenced today, it will continue to echo in the ears and infuse life into the hearts of the future generations too.
Maestro Amaradeva, may you attain the bliss of Nibbana,? the President said.

No permission to increase prices of powdered milk: Ravi
	
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake today said the prices of powdered milk would not be increased for any reason following the recent VAT increase imposed on imported powdered milk.
The VAT was imposed on imported powdered milk with effect from November 1 under the new VAT Amendment Act.
Issuing a statement, the minister said the powdered milk importers cannot increase prices without obtaining approval from the government as maximum prices have been already fixed for different varieties of powdered milk.
?It has been informed that the powdered milk importers have said that they want to discuss with the finance ministry either to increase the prices or to get VAT on powdered milk exempted.? The government will look into providing any other alternative relief to importers after ascertaining whether there is any truth in the complaints they have made,? he said.

No reason to create 'Aava': Gotabaya
	
Former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa said yesterday that there was no reason for the Army or Military Intelligence to create a gang like ?Aava?-- though Health Minister and Cabinet Spokesman Rajitha Senaratne had alleged that Mr. Rajapaksa had created the gang.
Mr. Rajapaksa said Minister Senaratne had made a direct accusation against the army and military intelligence.
?There was no reason for the army or for army intelligence to create a gang like ?Aava?. Under previous governments, they used to disarm paramilitary organisations like the Eelam People's Democratic Party (EPDP) and the People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE). We didn?t want to create new groups,? he said.
?We should remember that such statements will only increase the allegations against the Sri Lanka Army. Now Tamil politicians are also trying to make allegations, taking advantage of those statements,? he said.
?I?m not behind the ?Aava? group. I?m no longer in charge of the security forces and there are no intelligence units now. I have no authority to investigate such matters,? he said.
?There is no need to refute Minister Senaratne, because the answers to such questions should be given by President Maithripala Sirisena, the present Defence Secretary and the Commanders of the Armed Forces,? he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep and Indika Sri Aravinda)

Northern politicians apathetic about people's plights: Governor
	
Northern Governor Reginald Cooray today charged that certain Northern politicians were not concerned about the real problems faced by the people in the province and survive on misinformation and lies which fuel unrest in the North and the South.
He told a media conference that discrimination on the grounds of caste, social status and wealth have resulted in heartburn in the North where low caste Tamils were banned from entering prestigious schools and Kovils. The Northern people are also confronted with lack of housing, social problems, unemployment, low income and health issues.
?These are pressing problems that have brought in its wake much misery to the ordinary people who are in the majority. But unfortunately, politicians, the media and a section of the North and South have become victims of sensational, confusing and sometimes juicy news. What is sad is that most of the news is distorted and half baked giving a wrong message to the readers and viewers. This kind of news sustains extremists, fundamentalists and racists in the North and the South who are hell-bent on destabilising the country. Sadly, some political leaders thrive on such malicious canards,? the governor said.
He said it was improper to give an ethnic colour to incidents involving the police and the armed forces. Protests marches are held almost every day in many parts of the country. People are killed by underworld gangsters and during clashes with the forces. But when such incidents happen in the North they are reported differently resulting in a negative impact on reconciliation and ethnic harmony.
"The clash in the Jaffna University among two groups of students, the killing of the two undergrads at a police checkpoint and the attack on two police officers have been reported in the South and East in a manner that promotes incitement. The media must behave in a more responsible manner, the governor said. "Did any one protest or hold public rallies when the popular actor Nihal Silva was shot by the police when he refused to stop his vehicle at a police checkpoint in Wellawatta during the war. I won't attempt to exonerate the police but people must understand that the North is a war-affected province where peace and reconciliation has not been fully restored." (SAJ)

Responding to Chinese Ambassador Yi Xianliang, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake yesterday said he had every right to talk on behalf of Sri Lanka as a sovereign country.
Likewise, he said the Ambassador also had the same right to talk on behalf of his country. The Ambassador, at a recent media conference, said he asked Mr. Karunanayake as to why another loan was sought if the Chinese loans were expensive.
The Minister said if the rate was only two per cent as the Ambassador said, he was prepared to show how it had been higher than that.(Kelum Bandara)

Wimal?s daughter complains to NCPA against social media websites
	
MP Wimal Weerawansa's daughter today complained to the National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) saying she was being mentally harassed by false accusations made against her by several social media websites.
She was accompanied by her mother Shashi Weerawansa and lawyer Premanath Dolewatta.
Mr. Dolewatte told journalists that it was completely unethical and illegal to mentally harass a 15-year-old girl in connection with the unfortunate death Lahiru Janith who was found dead at Mr. Weerawnsa's residence last week.
?Several social media websites have made baseless allegations against Mr. Weearwansa's daughter compelling us to lodge a complaint the teenager is hesitating to attend the school. Such baseless allegations are a disgrace to the dead youth also,? he said.
Mr. Dolewatte urged the websites to refrain from taking political advantage from an unfortunate incident. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
