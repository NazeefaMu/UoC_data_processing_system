Up to president to act on COPE report: DEW
	
Parliamentary Committee on Public Enterprises Chairman DEW Gunasekara said today it was up to the President Maithripala Sirisena to obtain a copy of the report of the sub-committee that probed the controversial sale of Central Bank bonds and take appropriate action.
He added that the mandate of the COPE sub-committee was not to find any one guilty or exonerate.
Mr. Gunasekara told a media conference that he was keen to clarify the conflicting media reports and comments by politicians. He said subcommittee was of the view that the sale of the international sovereign bonds worth Rs.10 billion would have been more beneficial if it was transacted at a lower rate of interest.
Commenting on the remarks made by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on not being summoned by the committee, Mr. Gunasekara said Mr. Wickremesinghe should have known better.
He said COPE was mandated to inquire into questionable deals of public enterprises and summon only officials working there but has no authority to summon ministers.
"The Central Bank was was earlier supposed to sell Rs.1 billion of bonds but the amount was increased to Rs.10 billion at the auction," Mr. Gunasekera said and added that the interest rate derived from the auction was much higher than the rate indicated by the Central Bank to the primary dealers before the auction.

President Maithripala Sirisena has agreed to give nominations to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to contest from United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA), General Secretary Susil Premajayantha said today.
He told Daily Mirror the decision was taken by President Sirisena as Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) leader at a meeting of the constituent parties held at the presidential secretariat on Thursday.
Mr. Premajayantha said the UPFA steering committee would meet in the next few days and finalise the nomination list and Mr. Rajapaksa is expected to play a leading role to steer the UPFA to victory with an absolute majority.
?We expect to contest the upcoming general elections as a major political front uniting all progressive and democratic forces in the country and achieve a major victory on August 17. Mr. Rajapaksa will be the leader of the election campaign with the blessings and advice of President Sirisena,? Mr. Premajayantha added.

MR is like a crab in a boiling pot: UNP
	
Speaking on the decision of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to re-enter into politics, UNP Spokesman Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said Mr. Rajapaksa behaves like a crab dancing in a boiling pot of water.
He said therefore, Mr. Rajapaksa is allowed to do anything he wants until the election on August 17 in which he would be defeated again by the people.
?People will show a lesson to politicians who hoodwinked them,? Minister Kariyawasam said.
He said the UNP was not concerned or worried about giving nominations to former President to contest from the UPFA.
?Mr. Rajapaksa distributed so many things as incentives to the people during the previous presidential election campaign but still people rejected him. We, on the other hand won the election by 400,000 more votes without distributing goods among people,? he said. (Piyumi Fonseka)
