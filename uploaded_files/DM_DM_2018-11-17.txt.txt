CIA concludes Saudi Crown Prince behind Khashoggi murder
	
The US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has concluded Saudis powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was behind the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, The Washington Post reported Friday, citing people close to the matter.
The US assessment directly contradicts the conclusions of a Saudi prosecutor one day prior, which exonerated the prince of involvement in the brutal murder.
According to the CIA findings, 15 Saudi agents flew on government aircraft to Istanbul and assassinated Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate, the Post said.
Queried by AFP, the CIA declined to comment.
Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist, had gone to the consulate to obtain documents necessary to marry his Turkish fiancee.
Saudi Arabia has repeatedly changed its official narrative of the October 2 murder, first denying any knowledge of Khashoggis whereabouts and later saying he was killed when an argument degenerated into a fistfight.
In the latest version presented by the Saudi prosecutor on Thursday, a 15-member squad was formed to bring Khashoggi back from Istanbul by means of persuasion  but instead ended up killing the journalist and dismembering his body in a rogue operation.
The CIA scrubbed multiple intelligence sources, the Post said, among them a phone call between the princes brother  the Saudi ambassador to the United States  and Khashoggi.
The ambassador reportedly told the late journalist that he would be safe to go to the consulate in Istanbul and get the papers he needed.
The US intelligence agency also said in determining the Crown Princes role it considered him a de facto ruler in Saudi Arabia: The accepted position is that there is no way this happened without him being aware or involved, the Post quoted an official as saying.
That official dubbed Prince Mohammed a good technocrat  but also someone unpredictable who goes from zero to 60, doesnt seem to understand that there are some things you cant do.
The CIA conclusions threaten to further fray relations between Washington and key ally Riyadh, which has sought to end discussion of Khashoggis murder and rejected calls for an international investigation.
On Thursday the US Treasury slapped sanctions on 17 people, including close aides of Prince Mohammed, suggesting a coordinated effort between Riyadh and Washington to pre-empt the threat of harsher actions from an outraged US Congress.
US President Donald Trump has shied from directly blaming the Crown Prince but on Friday agreed with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that any cover up of the incident should not be allowed. (AGENCIES)

Darkest day in Parliamentary history: Dayasiri
	
The government blamed Speaker Karu Jayasuriya for the ugly and shameful actions by a some government MPs yesterday and said it was a conspiracy hatched by him.
Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said a large number of foreign diplomats, foreign media including Al Jazeera and foreign correspondents were eagerly following the hideous scenes in the House.
He told a news briefing that yesterday was one of the darkest days in the history of parliamentary democracy in Sri Lanka and pointed out that had not acted according to the compromise reached between President Maithripala Sirisena and the alliance led by the UNF on Thursday.
The agreement was to remove the first paragraph in the no-confidence motion that said the removal of Ranil Wickremesinghe from the premiership and the dissolution of Parliament were unconstitutional. Secondly, the handing of the NCM to the Speaker, deciding on the date of the debate and vote should have been done in accordance with parliamentary Standing Orders and traditions. But nothing of this was done yesterday and this is why the government members protested, Mr. Jayasekara said attempting to justify what happened in Parliament yesterday.
Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said the government MPs who participated at the party leaders meeting pointed out to the Speaker that if the NCM was to be taken up yesterday proper procedures had to be followed as agreed upon at the meeting with the President.
The Speaker did not agree to any of those demands. That was the start of the fracas in Parliament. The government MPs are not responsible for what happened in Parliament yesterday. We did not see a NCM. We demanded that the NCM must remain in the Order Book for at least five days for us to study the NCM. This also was ignored, the minister said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Do not follow orders from pseudo ministers: JVP
	
JVP Propaganda Secretary Vijitha Herath said that right now there is no constitutionally elected government, a cabinet or a Prime Minister and therefore, public servants must be extremely careful when carrying out orders from pseudo ministers.
They may claim to be Ministers, but none of them have been appointed or elected in accordance with the provisions laid down in the Constitution and therefore their orders to state institutions and public officials are illegal, he said.
He sounded the alarm on public officials and said they must think twice before carrying out orders from members of a bogus cabinet.
You are bound only by the Financial, Administrative Regulations and the instructions and guidelines of the Establishment Code. As such you must not follow illegal orders given by a politician who claims to be a Minister. If you do so, you will be in trouble in future, he further stressed. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

The Frontline Socialist Party should first put into words as to why they want to work with the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and should accept us as leftists, JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti said.
Frontline Socialist Party (FSP) Education Secretary Pubudu Jayagoda recently said in a news briefing that they were ready to work with the JVP or any party who call themselves leftists at this juncture where the county was embroiled in a devastating showdown in terms of politics, the economy and the Constitution.
Jayagoda said they would work with anybody except with Mahinda Rajapaksa, Maithripala Sirisena and Ranil Wickremesinghe who should be held responsible for this prevailing anarchical state.
Speaking to Daily Mirror, Handunnetti said the FSP had not officially invited them to work collaboratively even though it was mentioned in a news conference. They left us claiming that the JVPers were not pure leftists. If they wanted to work with us, they should explain on what grounds that they have taken such a step, Handunnetti added.
Unless they come out with satisfactory remarks over their decision to work with us, we will have to ignore their invitation, he added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

prosecutors reveal inadvertently
By Matt Zapotosky, Devlin Barrett (c) 2018, The Washington Post Nov 16, 2018 - WASHINGTON - WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been charged under seal, prosecutors inadvertently revealed in a recently unsealed court filing - a development that could significantly advance the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election and have major implications for those who publish government secrets. The disclosure came in a filing in a case unrelated to Assange. Assistant U.S. Attorney Kellen Dwyer, urging a judge to keep the matter sealed, wrote due to the sophistication of the defendant and the publicity surrounding the case, no other procedure is likely to keep confidential the fact that Assange has been charged. Later, Dwyer wrote the charges would need to remain sealed until Assange is arrested.

Khmer Rouge leaders guilty of genocide in landmark ruling
	

Two top leaders of Cambodias Khmer Rouge regime were found guilty of genocide on Friday, in a landmark ruling almost 40 years after the fall of a brutal regime that presided over the deaths of a quarter of the population. 
The Khmer Rouges former head of state Khieu Samphan, 87, and Brother Number 2 Nuon Chea, 92, are the two most senior living members of the ultra-Maoist group that seized control of Cambodia from 1975-1979. 
The reign of terror led by Brother Number 1 Pol Pot left some two million Cambodians dead from overwork, starvation and mass executions but Fridays ruling was the first to acknowledge a genocide. 
The defendants were previously handed life sentences in 2014 over the violent and forced evacuation of Phnom Penh in April 1975. 
But the judgement at the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) also found Nuon Chea guilty of genocide against the ethnic Vietnamese and Cham Muslim minority group, among a litany of other crimes.  The chamber finds that Nuon Chea exercised ultimate decision-making power with Pol Pot and... therefore finds Nuon Chea is responsible as a superior for all the crimes, presiding judge Nil Nonn said. Both parties were sentenced to life in prison, merging the two sentences into a single term, Nil Nonn said. Hundreds of people, including dozens of Cham Muslims and Buddhist monks, were bussed to the tribunal located in the outskirts of Phnom Penh to attend the hearing.

Modi enhanced benchmark price in Rafale deal: Congress
	

New Delhi, (Hindustan Times), 15 November 2018 - The Congress on Thursday stepped up its attack against Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Rafale, accusing him of enhancing the benchmark price for the 36 fighter aircraft by Euro 3 billion (Rs 22,743 crore) and waiving off the sovereign guarantee requirement in the deal.
Why did the Prime Minister set a higher benchmark price of Euro 8.2 Billion (Rs 62,166 crore) from Euro 5.2 billion (Rs 39,422 crore) Why did he waive the sovereign guarantee requirement, asked Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala at a news conference in Delhi.
The main opposition party also accused the Prime Minister of compromising national interest on the issue with Congress president Rahul Gandhi alleging that the latest skeleton to tumble out of the Rafale cupboard is that there is no guarantee by the French government backing the deal.
BUT, our PM says theres a letter from the French promising to be faithful. Thats enough to call this a Government to Government deal he asked on Twitter.

NCM: PM office says there are 12 steps to follow
	
The Office of the Prime Minister yesterday said there is a 12-step standard procedure which should be followed by the parliament when constitutionally passing a No-Confidence Motion (NCM) against a prime minister.
In a statement, Prime Minister's Secretary S. Amarasekara said the NCM should be first handed over to the speaker with at least 20 signatures.
The second step is Speaker consulting Parliament General Secretary over the legality of the NCM. If the Secretary says it is legal, the NCM should be included in the Order Book. The book should be printed on a Friday and then should be distributed among all the MPs. After five working days, the NCM should be given the opportunity to taken up for a debate," Mr. Amarasekara said.
Afterwards, he said the Committee on Parliamentary Business headed by the Speaker should decide which task from the Order Book should be given the priority. It is the Leader of House who decides the priority of the government's affairs," he said.
He said once the NCM was included in the Order Book, the nearest possible day to take it up for a debate should be decided with the consent of the Leader of House and the government.
"The next step is making an announcement saying the NCM would be taken up for a debate on a particular day. The Committee on Parliamentary Affairs should next decide on the time allocation for the Government and the Opposition MPs to debate the NCM. As the final steps, the NCM should be taken up for a debate on the fixed date and the results should be declared. At last, it should be included in the Hansard," Mr. Amarasekara said in the statement.
He also said all these steps should be conducted in a constitutional manner following the Standing Orders and parliamentary traditions. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Nuclear arms control is going down a Trumpian hole
	

Reacting to the radio interview by French President Emmanuel Macron to mark Armistice Day, in which he was reported as saying, We have to protect ourselves with respect to China, Russia and even the United States of America We need a true European army, President Donald Trump blew a fuse. He tweeted: President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the US, China and Russia. Very insulting.
In fact, Trumps reaction was based on reading a false report of what Macron said. In that part of the interview, he was talking about cyber attacks. Nevertheless, Macron was indeed angrily critical of Trump: When I see President Trump announcing that hes quitting a major disarmament treaty which was formed after the 1980s Euro-missile crisis that hit Europe, who is the main victim Europe and its security.
The treaty is the so-called I.N.F., the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, an arms control agreement from 1987 that helped to end the Cold War. It was signed by President Ronald Reagan and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.

Trump has already refused an offer by President Vladimir Putin to cut another 1000 inter-continental missiles, the same sized cut that was made with President Barack Obama. He is pouring tens of billions of dollars into upgrading US nuclear forces

Trumps move comes after President George W. Bush killed off the thirty-year-old Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002. At the time of its formulation, the former US Defence Secretary, Robert McNamara, when lobbying successfully for the treaty, argued that ballistic missile defence could provoke an arms race, and that it might provoke a surprise first-strike against the nation fielding the defence. The Russians regarded the Bush annulment as a step back to the fears and threats of the Cold War.
Now with the prospect of a second annulment, Moscow is up in arms, more than ever convinced that Washington is out to get the nuclear upper hand. All the indications are that it is. Trump has already refused an offer by President Vladimir Putin to cut another 1000 inter-continental missiles, the same sized cut that was made with President Barack Obama. He is pouring tens of billions of dollars into upgrading US nuclear forces.
This fits into the Trump philosophy of America First. He wants no constraints to be imposed on American foreign policy. This is why he quit the Paris climate accord and repudiated the international communitys nuclear deal with Iran (Since this was approved unanimously by the UN Security Council, the US is breaking international law.) Trump has even decided that the US will be leaving the 144-year-old Universal Postal Union (He says China gets too good a deal.)
The I.N.F. treaty establishes a prohibition of missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometres. Ending it is to inject an element of nuclear instability into European security. Russian nuclear weapons could then legitimately be targeted on Europe.
The administrations of Presidents Barack Obama and Trump have both argued that Russia has acted in flagrant violation of the treaty. Russias deployment of a new generation of 9M279 land-based cruise missiles is said to be a direct challenge to the I.N.Fs commitments.
However, the intelligence behind the US claim has never been published. Russia has legitimately complained itself about the impact on the nuclear balance of new US missile defence systems.
So far, European countries have lined up with the US. But now the tide is turning. Macron recently had a phone conversation with Trump arguing that the US remedy was counterproductive. He told Trump that he could lead a Nato-wide effort to hold Russia to the terms of the treaty, while discussing the pacts extension to other nuclear powers that now have medium range systems of their own.
In an editorial on October 24, the Financial Times argued, There is a temptation to see the idea of nuclear confrontation among great powers as belonging to the bygone age of Dr. Strangelove. The world has moved on from mutually assured destruction. The reality, amplified by the demise of the I.N.F. treaty, is the threat of a new era of nuclear instability, this time unchecked by the agreements that stabilised the stand-off between the US and the Soviet Union.Now that the US has cut loose, why should China -- or for that matter, Iran and North Korea -- accept voluntary restraint
During the time of President Bill Clinton, North Korea agreed to eliminate missiles with a range over 500 kilometres. The deal wasnt finalised. Today, it could be a base for constructing a new agreement. This would remove the Korean missile threat to Japan.
If the US ceased its confrontation with Iran, it could negotiate an agreement to limit its 500-kilometre-range systems. This would take away the Iranian missile threat to Israel. India, China and Pakistan could agree not to nuclearise missiles with ranges below 500kms. This would keep their short-range conventional missiles distinct from nuclear systems, reducing the destabilising ambiguity in such missiles.
But Trump wants to blow up all these positive possibilities.

P. de S. Wimalasundera (1917-2006) An inspiring personality
	
Piyatilake, as he was then known was the first born of Wimalasundera Fronis de Silva (W. F. de Silva) and Laura de Silva of Wackwella Road Galle. W. F. de Silva was a well-known jeweller, owner of two shops one in Chatham Street, Fort and the other in Dalada Veediya ( then known as Ward Street, Kandy). He had the privilege of being one of the few Sinhalese to be in this field and a pioneer in gems and jewellery, since 1902.
 
Piyatilake , my father had his primary education at Mahinda College, Galle but was sent off to Colombo, to Ananda College and boarded at a house nearby. He sat for his Matriculation exams and no sooner his father passed away quite unexpectedly. The responsibility of his family, of mother and four siblings fell on his shoulders. Young as he was at 17, he filled his fathers shoes managing two shops and properties in Galle. 
P. de S. Wimalasundera was one of a kind. He had a great vision, making plans to take the business to greater heights. His mother gave him all the encouragement. Galle is the home of excellent craftsmen be it jewellery or handicraft. 
Being an ambitious young man, at the crack of dawn he would be seen carrying two heavy bags full of these products walking up to the station to board the train to Kandy. It so happens that my mother, his future wife to be lived in a house overlooking his way to the station. Amma was amused at first but watching him regularly she started to anticipate and looking earnestly for him quite unknown to him. Weeks and months passed and one fine day his eyes locked hers and from then on each of them looked forward to meet up. Having lost her mother at the age of 6 my mother was home schooled and was well protected. She had no way of expressing her feelings with the very strict authoritarian father that she had. She refused many marriage proposals and finally she was delighted when her father consented to the proposal from this bright and handsome young man an astute businessman by then. 
As the business and family grew Thatha realized the importance of being closer to Colombo and took the bold step and moved to the city. If Thatha wanted something he would get the best, that was my father as I knew him! 
Soon after he bought and renovated a bungalow in a quiet residential area in Fife road to accommodate his growing family of 10 children. Not contented in a rented premises in Fort he built his own, a three storeyed building in Main Street, Pettah and established his thriving gem, jewellery and watch import business. Thatha was always one step ahead, to advertise his products he created a radio programme Swarnadara with his good friend Ariyadasa Peris who was then attached to the commercial service of Radio Ceylon. 
My mother worked really hard and supported him all the way. Our household was always a hub of activity, there were people going in and out with the shop workers, drivers etc. With Thaatha around life never had a dull moment, something was happening all the time! 
Thatha was an ardent reader as much as he was a shrewd businessman, while reading he never missed an unfamiliar word, checked with the oxford dictionary immediately and learnt then and there. With all his work he also made time to pick us from school on a daily basis and attend to our needs whether it was school work or otherwise. He loved movies and was quite keen on producing a movie till Amma put her foot down with a firm no. 
Coming from a very conservative family Amma was very keen to secure the future of the children especially the girls. She believed in arranging marriages for her growing up daughters and was very keen that they have a house each and having 10 children it was not going to be an easy task. Thaatha as usual arose to the need acquiring a huge block of land quite close to our home and building an apartment block which was quite unheard of in the nineteen sixties. The government brought in a housing act, ceiling on houses, which meant he would not be able to own this property for long!! After so much planning, effort, time and money he was very disappointed. 
Being the man he was he gave much thought and came up with the idea of turning this project to a hotel and that was how Hotel Janaki came to be ! Hotel Janaki opened its doors on 29th July 1976.
Now we have come a long way 42 years! Now it is time for the third generation to keep Thathas vision alive. 
Dear Thatha, you were not an ordinary human being, 
You were smart in every aspect 
You were the bright light in our lives. 
May you attain the supreme bliss of Nirvana! Mano

Party with a majority has say in Parliament: Ranil
	
United National Party (UNP) Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday the party which had a majority would have its say despite the incidents that took place in Parliament yesterday.
Yesterdays incidents in Parliament are disgraceful and shameful. It is a blow to people. The members of the SLFP and the Pohotuwa prevented the Speaker from coming into the chambers. He was about 45 minutes late when he could walk in. They attacked our MPs, several of them including MPs Gamini Jayawickrama Perera, Malik Samarawickrama and Vijitha Herath were injured, he said. The House has however passed a no-confidence motion under clauses 47(1) and 47(2) of the Constitution under the instructions given by the President to amend it before submitting it to a voice vote. Therefore majority has every right to have their say, he added.
MP Patali Champika Ranawaka said the police and the armed forces should be now advised by the President to remove the ministers of Rajapaksa administration from their ministries as they no longer can hold on to office as they have been defeated by a no-confidence motion.
The voice vote is legal as such a vote can be exercised in the House initially while resorting to other forms of voting only when a member calls for a division under parliamentary Standing Orders and Traditions, Mr. Wickremesinghe said and asked whether those who did not heed the majority voice in Parliament accept the people's verdict at an election.

The government representatives are reported to have told Speaker Karu Jayasuriya that they would agree to a no-confidence motion only if it could be taken up through the procedure stipulated in the Standing Orders.
Chief Government Whip Dinesh Gunawardane has told the party leaders meeting that the government should be recognized first and then a no-confidence motion should be brought in line with Standing Orders and parliamentary traditions.
He said once the motion is submitted, it should be placed on the Order Paper and the Business Committee of Parliament should decide on a date for the debate.
Mr. Gunawardane had pointed out the Speaker had not given a favourable reply to the government request. Government representatives were of the view that the no-confidence motion was a serious business that should not be rushed through.
Meanwhile, the government urged the Speaker to allow police to record statements from UNP MPs Palitha Thewarapperuma and Ranjan Ramanayake who were alleged to have smuggled knives into the Chamber during the ruckus on Thursday.

     Astana Declaration 2018     

An interview with Dr. Chamath Fernando, Lecturer, Department of Family Medicine, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Sri Jayewardenepura.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified 21 young members from over 2000 applicants from around the world to raise a voice for the youth and advocate for the development of Primary Health Care (PHC). This team included a diverse group of young professionals including general practitioners, primary care nurses, researchers, health economists, academics, policy makers and so on. 
Dr. Chamath Fernando, a Family Doctor and a Lecturer in Family Medicine employed by the Department of Family Medicine, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Sri Jayewardenepura has been appointed by WHO to the PHC Young Leaders Network (YLN). He also acts as the coordinator for the National Centre for Primary Care and Allergy Research at the University. Having brought an immense honour to our tiny island representing Sri Lanka as a youth member at the Global Conference on Primary Health Care held in Astana, Kazakhstan in October 2018, Dr. Chamath explains to Daily Mirror this major leap.

Another aspect of the Astana Declaration was the potential inputs of digital technologies and how they can be utilized to deliver specialty expertise

History
The WHO in 1978, came into a pact with all its member states in an aim for equitable healthcare access for the entire world population through Alma Ata Declaration in the former capital of Kazakhstan, Almaty. The declaration was based on PHC and its salience in attaining Universal Health Coverage (UHC). Whilst recognizing UHC to be a fundamental human right: UHC means that all people and communities can use the promotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitative and palliative health services they need, of sufficient quality to be effective, while also ensuring that the use of these services does not expose the user to financial hardship (WHO). However, during the past four decades the achievement of the said goals in line with the health related Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) have been patchy and has not reached the expectations across the globe as of today. 

A paradigm shift 
At the Global Conference on PHC which was held in October 2018 in Astana, WHO formulated the Astana Declaration, marking the 40th anniversary of Alma Ata Declaration. Certain barriers that led to unsatisfactory achievements made in UHC were identified and has attempted to mould the standards to meet the resources and needs of the current socio-techno-political milieu, says Dr. Fernando.
He further mentioned that, in addition to the promotive, preventive, curative and rehabilitative aspects of healthcare that the Alma Ata Declaration looked at, the Astana Declaration has included Palliative Care as a priority area. Considering the advancements made in medical technologies that makes diagnoses and treatment much early and farther efficacious, the numbers of people surviving otherwise lethal diseases into old age, hence needing palliative care are on the rise.
Another aspect of the Astana Declaration was the potential inputs of digital technologies and how they can be utilized to deliver specialty expertise in the distance mode to populations living in the peripheries with abundant health resources. The significance of the input from Primary Care physicians and teams has been acknowledged in the document and Electronic Health Records (EHR) have been increasingly encouraged for primary care providers to maintain and to use in turn in the referral and back-referral processes; an area on which YLN has a specific interest.
The most highlighted motive here is to create an operational framework for PHC: transforming vision into action.

Where does Sri Lanka stand
The WHO carried out Country Case Studies involving 18 countries from around the world that set examples for other nations to develop their framework on. Healthcare professionals of Sri Lanka deserve an applause that the Community-based workforce development for maternal and child health of our country has been presented as one of these 18 case studies. Primary Health Care Systems (PRIMASYS) is also another publication that disseminated the success stories of different countries. Dr. Chamath Fernando also contributed to the development of the Sri Lankan version of this publication in 2016-2017 period in liaison of Emeritus Professor Antoinette Perera who was the Principal Investigator for the project.
The Director General Health Services Dr. Anil Jasingherepresented Sri Lanka at the Global Conference on PHC. It was an honour that Dr. Jasinghe presented in a plenary session on how the Sri Lankan health system successfully combatted certain communicable diseases (principally Malaria) thus achieving elimination locally. 

Future directives
Although the quantitative figures demonstrate the best set of health indices in the South Asian region, we lack qualitative studies looking at the quality of care the patients receive and their perspectives in terms of satisfaction. Some parameters that would potentially determine their satisfaction include ease of access to healthcare, costs, holistic solutions to health related problems which are mainly undertaken by a Family Doctor.
Sri Lankan Medical Postgraduate Institute produces a multitude of specialists and sub-specialists in varying fields at present. While the successful healthcare systems in the world such as the USA, UK and Australia produces adequate numbers of Family Physicians, Sri Lanka lags behind in this at large where the postgraduate path (13 years in duration) is not encouraging and merely less than 8 Family Physicians being produced per year for a population of 20 million.
Better late than never, Astana Declaration highlights that Sri Lanka is to develop key human resources, mainly Family Physicians to deliver primary care and coordinating the patient care at secondary and tertiary levels, thus ensuring UHC at loco-regional levels. The system must be incorporated into the existing public health system of Sri Lanka where all citizens must have access to high-quality healthcare at no cost ideally. The healthcare providers should also be trained on novel approaches to care such as provision of generalist palliative care which is increasingly necessary for the global population.
The major paradigm-shift would be to move from disease oriented therapies to patient centred care. A point to ponder is that a Family Doctor is more concerned about the patient who has an illness as opposed to the traditional way of looking at the illness a particular patient has, Dr. Fernando underscored.

The hotchpotch is not workable Dr. N.M. Perera in 1978
	
     Who is to prevail finally and which policy is to prevail      

sovereignty of people should be delegated from time to time to representatives chosen bythe people

The Anglo-Saxon Parliamentary system and the American Presidential system are two alternative forms of government. The two cannot be mixed and the hotchpotch that he has presented is not workable  NM
Nanayakkarapathirage Martin Perera joined the London School of Economics and University of London in 1927 as a student of the legendary Professor Harold Laski.
Being awarded his first doctorate for his thesis on The Constitution of the German Weimar Republic, he was invited to read for a second thesis on A further comparative study of the Constitutions of the UK, United States, France and Germany, which won him a DSc. When the current Constitution was established in 1978 by JRJ, NM his contemporary at University College was out of Parliament though, authored, Critical Analysis of the New Constitution of the Sri Lanka [1978] scrutinising the document and revealing the ill effects of it.
Addressing a seminar on the proposed JRJ Constitution, NM said, The fact that the President has the authority to assign to himself any topic or function which he desires to take over, he can at will reduce or remove any function already agreed to the PM or to any other minister. In these complicated circumstances, what happens to the left majority in the House supporting a left Prime Minister who is saddled with a President sponsoring an opposite policy in conflict with the declared policy of a majority in the Parliament How is this conflict to be resolved Will that President be prepared to swallow his pride and foreswear his convictions adumbrated in his own declared policy when he assumed office If neither is prepared to give way, there will be a deadlock. The whole governmental machinery will come to a standstill.
Writing on the 1978 Constitution, he says, The manner in which this Bill has been rushed through Parliament makes us a little suspicious. What is there so urgent about amending a Constitution After all, Constitutional Amendments are potent not for a year or two but for all time. He continued, I can think of no country with a written Constitution that enables Constitutional amendments to be carried through in the headlong manner that he has done. Most Constitutional amendments take years to fructify and some countries provide even for a referendum before such an amendment is made effective. There may be many in this country who hold different views on the Presidential system of government. Why should they be deprived of the right to express their different viewpoints to the legislature and to the people of the country and urge that full consideration and weight be given to their views
This statement of the Prime Minister is tantamount to a rejection of Parliamentary government for developing countries. It is necessary to remind him that this is the basis on which most of the newly-independent countries in the continent of Africa have proceeded. Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, Uganda, Nigeria, Zaire, Malawi and so forth have plunged for one party rule. They have emasculated the whole conception of Parliamentary democracy on the ground that developing countries need stable governments to carry out the task of economic development,
NM emphasised.
The nett result of this one party rule and the stamping out of opposition in terms of political degeneracy, economic mismanagement and downright corruption has to be seen to be believed. Tribal rivalries have rendered this intolerable situation inevitable. Does not J.R. Jayewardene by implication express this sub-conscious preference for a one party dictatorship in Sri Lanka NM questioned.
Probing the history of the Presidential form of government, NM said, The founding fathers of the American Constitution devised a system under which they thought the party system could not take root or flourish. So they hammered out the institutions of government with the deliberate aim of discouraging parties and they fondly believed that the President with executive powers can achieve this objective. They were also misled into accepting the wrongly-conceived Montesquion dictum.
Montesquieu, the French philosopher (1689/1755) who campaigned for the separation of executive, legislative and judicial powers according to him, misunderstood the working of the British system and wrongly attributed the success of that system to a separation of the three key powers, and that actually, there was no such separation. The executive was part of the legislature and most of the superior judges were appointed by the executive. NM believed any kind of strict compartmentalising was not conceivable and, proceeding on this wrong theory, founders of the American Constitution separated the legislature and the executive completely. As he enlightened us, neither the President nor the Cabinet were members of the legislature. Except for conveying a memorandum to the congress he had no place in the legislature at all.
The assassination of Bandaranaike threw the whole country into a period of uncertainty and bewilderment and instability in 1959, but recovered satisfactorily to give a clear mandate to Sirimavo in July 1960. JRJ ousted her government before its time by dubious scheme; used a few SLFP MPs and engineered a defeat of the government in 1964.
Dr. N.M. Perera questioned, In the face of this familiarity, why are we floating merrily to embrace an unfamiliar Constitutional form The experience of other countries bashed about by the countless snags in the Presidential form, we would be stupid to ignore. Coup detat has followed coups in these countries. And stagnation and poverty have been the hapless heritage of the masses in these states. Are we blindly to get into this doubtful gamble and throw away fifty years of Parliamentary democracy, which with all its flaws have offered a measure of steadiness and progress We have certainly shunned the violent disorder that other Presidential system practised states, except the US, have witnessed...
He said, The President will preside over the meetings of the Cabinet. The PM and the Cabinet are appointed by him. JR has taken the safety measure of stating that he must decide as PM one who he thinks commands a majority in the House.
Commenting on JRs idea of creating an Executive Presidency, The Constitution of a country must have checks and balances if it were to function properly taking into account the diversities in the country eventuating in the highest common factor of agreement. There can be fair time lag between the elections for the two establishments. One can, therefore, imagine a situation where two diverse political characters can prevail in the two bodies. A left-of the centre Parliament can well confront a right-inclined President. This can be the beginning of a continuing and unceasing conflict. The President appoints the PM from among the members. He will choose one who he thinks commands a majority in the House. With a left majority in the House, he will be obliged to choose a left Prime Minister.
Discussing a future conflict, he said, A two-thirds majority against the President can remove him. This is unlikely in the future if the PR system is brought into existence. If the Parliament is having a majority against the President, it can refuse to pass money to carry out the administration and the President in turn would turn down to endorse as law any actions passed by Parliament. A disillusioned and aggravated population will make short shrift of Parliament. It can well be the preclude to a Fascist government. Is this what we are slowlyinching towards
Dr.N.M.continued, If neither party is prepared to yield ground, the Constitution might as well be scrapped. It will be unworkable. The whole country sick of Parliamentary democracy will turn to alternative forms of government such as Fascism. It is a pity that JR has ceased to think of the future. The present Parliament may well shun the kind of deadlock that I have prognosticated but the next Parliament will not. We would be guilty of an unforgivable crime if in fashioning a Constitution for this country we become obsessed by the advantages we can reap by the present concatenation of favourable circumstances. It is wrong to presume that the antagonism between the President and Parliament will spring only from the political complexions of the two bodies diverge. This is not the experience of the United States where the Presidential system continues to function albeit with cracks and groans. The tendency over the years is for the legislature to become suspicious of the power welded by the President andhis entourage.
Concluding Dr. N.M. Perera asked, Who is to prevail finally and which policy is to prevail These are unresolvable problems which will end in the discrediting of democracy itself. As I have adverted earlier on this hotchpotch of a Constitution will not work. JR was wrong in his assertion that the Constitution he has introduced does not influence the sovereignty of the people. It is only partially true. This new Constitution will erode into the sovereignty of the people. The sovereignty of the people cannot be distributed through a number of institutions. Section 4 of the 1972 Constitution emphatically states: The sovereignty of the people is exercised through Parliament of elected representatives of the people. The sovereignty of the people should be delegated from time to time to representatives chosen by the people.
We can only hope that, wiser counsel will prevail. And Constitutional amendments should be made the subject of more long-drawn-out and profounder deliberations.

THE PARLIAMENT THE CONSTITUTION AND THE PRESIDENT
	
Bad smell emanating from Constitutional mud-pit owing to arbitrary actionsof MS
Parliament should not be a rubber-stamp of executive presidency
Legislature and executive may sport different political complexions


As a student of politics, I have read a number of times Dr.N.M. Pereras thesis, A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE 1978 CONSTITUTION, as I love it and its revolutionary author, unreservedly. However, to refresh my memory once again, I went through it a few hours ago as my MOTHERLAND is undergoing a deep Constitutional crisis, endangering the democratic system of government. In this thesis, the LSSP leader has predicted the evils of the Presidential system of government, in the following two paragraphs as far back as year 1978, the year that should be regarded as a national tragedy and catastrophe -- the year that gave birth to the illegitimate child widely regarded as the 1978 CONSTITUTION OF J.R. JAYAWARDENA.
In his preface to his thesis, Dr. Perera says: (A) It is conceivable that the executive and the legislature can develop an unbridgeable antagonism. The legislature and the executive may sport different political complexions. This is all the more so because the Presidential elections do not coincide with the elections to the legislature. The country might well face a situation where a left majority legislature has to confront a right-inclined President or vice-versa. In either case, the ensuing deadlock may create an impasse which might lead to the discrediting of democracy itself. Moreover, a strong Prime Minister who is himself an elected member and therefore, with popular backing may refuse to knuckle down to an equally self-willed President. In the end, the President may cut the Gordian Knot by dismissing this Prime Minister and appointing a substitute. Will he command a majority in the House especially if the outgoing Prime Minister had the full backing of the Parliament

When Parliament was prorogued, the President said he had the numbers. He was confident of mastering 113 votes to stabilise his power

Dr. N.M. Perera continues: (B) This is also the experience of the Philippines, which because of its close association in the past with the United States, embraced the Presidential system. If power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely, then the deterioration of the American Republics into dictatorships is easily understood. The Presidential system offers unlimited scope for wielding unlimited power albeit for a limited period. But the taste of unlimited power grows with the feeding and the lust cannot be easily satiated. It is a matter of regret that Sri Lanka has amassed considerable experience in Parliamentary government and has successfully overcome the teething troubles of the early period should now be thrown down the slope of Constitutional confusion in the end jeopardizing democracy itself.
When Parliament was prorogued, the President said he had the numbers. He was confident of mastering 113 votes to stabilise his power. Not only once, he went on repeating it and the voters believed in his story. Several other accomplices of the President went a further mile away from the President and claimed they could even command 120-124 votes in the Parliament. However, with all these big noises coming to an end in the midnight, the PARLIAMENT was arbitrarily dissolved and the whole nation dragged into another unwanted general election, even before the due date. Is it correct or is it in conformity with democratic principles and practices and established procedures and parliamentary customs The arbitrary actions of the executive have paved the way to establish and nurture nepotism.

It should be stated here, that there can be no liberty where the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person, or body of magistrates, or if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative andexecutive powers

It was the duty of the President to seek advice from the Supreme Court in all these matters, in the absence of a Constitutional Court. I think he has deviated from this noble principle.
The Supreme Court of America has earned a reputed name in judicial circles all over the world for taking balanced and independent decisions without bowing its head to the executive. President George W. Bush, seeking to protect the nation after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, issued an executive order creating special military commissions to try suspected enemy combatants who were being held at Guantanamo Bay. His decision, combined with other assertions of unilateral Presidential power to authorise something close to torture or indefinite detention of suspected terrorists, provoked more criticisms than any other in his presidency. Bush had been emboldened to act in part because his legal advisers had assured him that unilateral action would be upheld as Constitutional under his powers as commander in chief, and also perhaps, because the Chief Justice he had recently appointed, John G. Roberts, Jr., had sustained Bushs actions as an appellate judge.
When the Supreme Court heard the case in 2006, Roberts properly rescued himself because of his earlier participation in the case, but Bush still had reason for optimism: seven of the nine judges were Republican appointees, including an associate justice appointed by Bush, Samuel A. Alito. In Hamdon V. Rumsfield, however, by a vote of 5-3, the Supreme Court held that the Presidents military commissions were illegal. In his opinion for the court, Justice John Paul Stevans emphasised that the President could create military commissions only with congressional support, and congress had refused to give Bush the power to create the military commissions at issue in the case (THE SUPREME COURT - The personalities and rivalries that defined America - By Jeffrey Rosen, Professor at Law, George Washington University and the legal affairs editor of the New Republic.)

The Supreme Court of America has earned a reputed name in judicial circles all over the world for taking balanced and independent decisions without bowing its head to the executive

All these means that the Parliament should not be a rubber-stamp of the executive presidency.
It should be stated here, that there can be no liberty where the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person, or body of magistrates, or if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers. In short, liberty and dictatorship are incompatible.
Prof. G.L. Pieris carried out a commendable struggle from 2015 onwards as the Podujana Eksath Peramuna Chairman against the various manipulations of the executive presidency. As a result of these repeated arbitrary actions of the executive presidency taken recently, a bad smell is emanating from the Constitutional mud-pit.
Writing the FOREWARD column to Dr. Pereras masterpiece, the eminent jurist and leading criminal lawyer Sri Lanka has ever produced, Dr. Colvin R. De Silva says: What has actually been given to us in the name of an American model is a jumble from diverse Presidential type Constitutions adopted to suit the interests of the capitalist class in Sri Lanka. The jumble far from being a Parliamentary democracy is a Constitutional Presidential dictatorship dressed in the raiment of a Parliamentary democracy. The question to be faced is whether our journey towards peoples power along the path of Parliamentary democracy will be forever obstructed by the Jayawardena Constitution. IT COULD VERY WELL BE A REVOLUTIONARY QUESTION.

Theresa May vows to face down Tory Eurosceptic revolt
	

UK, (Daily Mail), 16 Nov 2018 - Theresa May vowed to face down Tory Eurosceptics today amid fears Michael Gove the Environment Secretary could deal a hammer blow by quitting to join the revolt. 
The Prime Minister said she had a good conversation with Mr Gove - but refused to be drawn on whether he had turned down a move to become the new Brexit Secretary.
Gove stayed tight lipped about his intentions when he left his London home this morning, as Mrs May launched another defence of the deal she has thrashed out with Brussels. In a phone in on LBC Radio, Mrs May admitted she had concerns about the Irish border backstop - but insisted the overall package was the best thing forthe UK. 
Mrs May also denied claims that the DUP is on the verge of withdrawing support for the government, saying: We are still working with the DUP. 
She dodged questions about whether she would be able to carry on if Mr Gove walks out, saying: I want all of my colleagues in cabinet to carry on doing the excellent job they are doing.

Tolerance: Powerful force for unity in diversity - EDITORIAL
	

With intolerance and a lack of respect for the principle of unity in diversity causing an unprecedented political and Constitutional crisis in Sri Lanka, the United Nations yesterday marked the International Day for Tolerance. 
In a statement, the UN says it is committed to strengthening tolerance by fostering mutual understanding among cultures and people. This imperative lies at the core of the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is more important than ever in this era of rising and violent extremism and widening conflicts that are characterized by a fundamental disregard for human life. 
Indeed, when reflecting on this, most Sri Lankans must be wondering what on earth is going on in this country and where we go from here while in Parliament  expected to be an august assembly representing the sovereign people  we saw during the past three days a large number of MPs behaving in a disgraceful if not disgusting manner. On Thursday, President Maithripala Sirisena had requested party leaders to make some changes in the motion of no-confidence against Mahinda Rajapaksa, and take it up for a vote by name yesterday afternoon. But instead pandemonium broke out again and the Speaker  who came to his table under heavy police escort, said sittings would be held again on Monday, November 19. Hopes of a just, peaceful and all-inclusive society  the vision of the Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera  appear to be dim but we need to continue to hope that when the darkness is over and the tempest is done, there will be a better tomorrow. 
In 1996, the UN General Assembly by a resolution urged UN Member States to observe the International Day for Tolerance on November 16. This action followed up on the United Nations Year for Tolerance, 1995. It was proclaimed by the UN General Assembly in 1993 at the initiative of the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) as outlined in the Declaration of Principles on Tolerance and Follow-up Plan of Action for the Year.
The UN has launched a new campaign to promote tolerance, respect and dignity across the world. Together is a global campaign that aims to reduce negative perceptions and attitudes towards refugees and migrants, and to strengthen the social contract among host countries, communities, refugees and migrants. 
The UN Department of Public Information said that to mark the day it would yesterday stage an event, which would feature the 2018 YouTube Creators for Change programme. It said the event would include a screening of international short films from inspirational creators who use YouTubes global reach to change conversations around tough issues and make a truly positive impact on the world. Selected students would also present projects linked to the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Sustainable Development Goals.
In 1995, to mark the UN Year for Tolerance and the 125th anniversary of the birth of the legendary Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi, UNESCO created a prize for the promotion of tolerance and non-violence. The UNESCO Madanjeet Singh prize rewards significant activities in the scientific, artistic, cultural or communication fields aimed at the promotion of a spirit of tolerance and non-violence. The prize is awarded every two years. The prize may be awarded to institutions, organisations or persons, who have contributed in a particularly meritorious and effective manner to tolerance and non-violence.
On the day of its fiftieth anniversary, November 16, 1995, UNESCOs Member States adopted a Declaration of Principles on Tolerance. Among other things, the declaration affirms that tolerance is neither indulgence nor indifference. It is respect and appreciation of the rich variety of our worlds cultures, our forms of expression and ways of being human. Tolerance recognises the universal human rights and fundamental freedoms of others. People are naturally diverse; only tolerance can ensure the survival of mixed communities in every region of the globe, UNESCO said. 
The declaration qualifies tolerance not only as a moral duty, but also as a political and legal requirement for individuals, groups and States. It places tolerance in relation to the international human rights instruments drawn up over the past fifty years and emphasises that States should draft new legislation when necessary to ensure equality of treatment and of opportunity for all groups and individuals in society. We hope Sri Lanka will also do so despite the current crisis which was caused not only by intolerance but also selfishness and self-centredness among some politicians.

US stresses importance of democratic outcome to SL political developments
	
The United States have underscored the importance of increasing shared regional interests with Japan, India and Australia to achieve an outcome to political developments in Sri Lanka which is consistent with democratic principles.
The US has also emphasized advancing shared regional interests in supporting the new Maldivian Government.
These sentiments had been conveyed when senior officials from the US, Australia, India, and Japan met in Singapore for consultations on the Indo-Pacific region on Thursday (15).
In a statement, the US Department of State said the officials at the meeting have reaffirmed a shared commitment to maintain and strengthen a rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific region in which all nations are sovereign, strong, and prosperous.
They further highlighted the complementary visions for the region held by their four countries, grounded in a shared support for a free, open, and inclusive region that fosters universal respect for international law, freedom of navigation and overflight, and sustainable development.
Officials from the four countries focused on their shared goals, including support for sustainable development, connectivity, and good governance.
They reaffirmed their strong support for ASEAN centrality and the ASEAN-led regional architecture, as well as their support for other regional institutions such as the Indian Ocean Rim Association and the Pacific Islands Forum. Participants highlighted the importance of coordination and collaboration with all interested countries and institutions to support a diverse, peaceful, and prosperous region.
The four countries looked forward to regular consultations on Indo-Pacific engagement and initiatives, the statement said.

UPFA Kalutara District Parliamentarian Kumara Welgama said yesterday that it was questionable for the UPFA to remain in the government by force without the support of 113 members of the House.
Speaking to the media yesterday while leaving the Parliament where pandemonium reigned, Welgama said the UPFA must leave the government if it did not have the support of the majority members of the House. we are used to sit in the Government as well as the Opposition. then why should we stay in the government by force he asked.
He said nobody listened to seniors today and what happened today was witnessed by the diplomats who were at the Speakers gallery. all these things will go to the world, he lamented. He stated that any issue could be resolved through negotiations. Nobody listens to us, we cannot even approach them. I do not think that a veteran politician like Mahinda Rajapaksa would condone these things Welgama stated.
