19A: Passage in the balance
	
The much-awaited passage of the 19th Amendment in Parliament next Tuesday (21) hung in the balance with the opposition expressing fears of new amendments being introduced at the committee stage of the debate and insisting that the 19th Amendment and electoral reforms should be approved simultaneously.
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) reiterated its position yesterday that both constitutional and electoral reforms should be enacted together and as such the vote on the 19th Amendment should be put off after its debated on April 21.
SLFP MP G.L. Peiris told Daily Mirror that his party had consistently expressed this stance and reiterated it at the party leaders meeting.
He said his party sought the Speaker's intervention to make sure that the government would not try to incorporate the provisions requiring a referendum into the constitutional amendments during the committee stage.
Mr. Peiris said the provisions requiring a referendum would negate the SC ruling if such provisions were introduced during the committee stage.
He said the SLFP would not allow the Constitution to be flouted.
The party leaders meeting presided by Deputy Speaker Chandima Weerakkody was attended by the UNP and the opposition parties. It ended without a decision being taken on the matter.
Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) Leader Tissa Vitharana told Daily Mirror that all opposition parties except the TNA opposed the passing of the 19th Amendment in its present form at the committee stage and added that if the government was not ready to compromise, the UPFA would not support it.
The government position was that all changes as determined by the Supreme Court ruling had to be incorporated in the 19th Amendment at the committee stage and passed with a simple majority. But we opposed it and said we want a new draft in line with the Supreme Court determination. We want it gazetted and SC approval obtained if we are to support it, Prof. Vitharana said.
He stressed the need to come out of this impasse and told Daily Mirror that the UPFA expected to meet President Maithripala Sirisena on the weekend and sort out this matter amicably and pave the way for the debate and approval on April 20 and 21.

Court fight with ex-wife strands father of two in SL
	
		 		 
		 
			
A former Sunshine Coast (Australia) man who helped thousands of victims of the Sri Lankan tsunami is now trapped in his adopted country and separated from his partner and children.
Dusan Jacenko, who launched his own mercy mission to feed and clothe tsunami victims in 2005, says he is now virtually a prisoner in the island paradise after his personal and professional lives crumbled.
When Jayden Jacenko turned two yesterday, his father wasn't there to celebrate.
Instead, Dusan Jacenko was half a world away, trapped in a Sri Lankan legal minefield.
An ongoing dispute over maintenance payments to his ex-wife has left the former Sunshine Coast man virtually a prisoner in the island nation he has called home since 1999.
The dispute has become so bogged down in that country's legal system not even the Australian High Commission appears to be able to help.
Meanwhile, his partner, Thushari, and their two young children are living with Dusan's son and his family on the Sunshine Coast, hoping for a miracle.
Dusan sent them to Australia at the end of last year, saying he feared for their safety at the hands of his ex-wife.
More than three months later, Thushari says Jayden and his three-year-old sister, Jazz, still cry every night.
"Every night they talk to him (on Skype) and they are crying. It is just heartbreaking and it's not getting any easier for them or me.
"I am trying to be strong and not show them how much I am hurting too, but I don't know what to do."
It is a far cry from 2005 when Dusan was hailed a hero after using his own money to feed and clothe victims of the Sri Lankan tsunami.
Soon after, his marriage fell apart. Then, in 2013, the garment factory where he worked was closed down.
He also claims to have uncovered a plot by his estranged wife to have him killed.
After he met Thushari, he says his ex-wife began a campaign of harassment and assaults that forced him to send his young family to live in Landsborough.
"He told me we had to get out of the country for our own safety and he would join us in two months," Thushari said.
"His family has taken us in and looked after us, but we want Dusan to be here with us."
Dusan is caught in a Catch- 22 situation.
The Sri Lankan courts will not allow him to get a divorce and leave the country until he pays maintenance he still owes, but his visa does not allow him to work in order to make the money he needs.
He has made payment offers but is continually frustrated by unexpected court adjournments, language barriers and a questionable legal system.
Thushari said she now considered Australia her home and had no plans of returning to Sri Lanka, despite still having family there.
There was no way Dusan would consider returning.
"He hates that country," Thushari said. "He was always helping poor people, with food and everything, and then this is how they have treated him."
Wheels turning too slowly for Australian pleading for assistance
DUSAN Jacenko could be forgiven for feeling abandoned by his own country.
While he waits for a Sri Lankan court to decide his fate, the Australian Government appears to have done little to help.
When it became clear Dusan was being buried under the Sri Lankan legal system, his family in Australia took his case to Member for Fisher, Mal Brough, whose office alerted the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
An Australian Embassy official advised Dusan it could not interfere in a court case but undertook to look into the matter and requested his court papers on March 27.
By April 8, when he had heard nothing, Dusan wrote, almost begging for news.
"Please give me an update on the situation.
"... why don't we just wait and you can ship me home in a box and explain to my children why they no longer have a daddy
"I simply need to know."
On April 10, Mr Brough's office replied to a Sunshine Coast Daily inquiry with: "Dusan has received Consular assistance and this is continuing. Unfortunately the Consulate is unable to intervene in court matters. I am very pleased that Dusan has been able to engage legal representation to assist him with his court case".
At that stage, Dusan had no legal representation, could not afford an interpreter and was struggling to get information from consular officials.
On April 13, DFAT responded to a series of questions from the Daily with: "The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continues to provide all appropriate consular assistance in line with the Consular Services Charter to an Australian man in Sri Lanka."
A frustrated Mr Jacenko said the response was similar to others he had received in the past and "may as well be computer generated".(Sunshine Coast Sunday)

Current PR systems is the best for minority parties-Mano
	
		 		 
		 
			
Democratic peoples Front Leader and national executive council member Mano Ganeshan said that current proportional representation (PR) system is the best system that has paved way not only for minority parties but also for the minor parties.
We agree on the shortcomings of the current system. They have to be rectified. But such rectification should not lead to large blunders in haste, Ganeshan said in a statement.
We call upon all those who campaign for the electoral reforms to let the next elections to be held under the current system. Any new system need to address our fears. We need further discussions. Besides the voters need to be given reasonable time to understand the new system. We cannot agree to the private agendas of certain big parties those wanted reform to suit their own ends, he said.Full statement
Parties representing Tamil and Muslim people in this country were against the abolition of the executive presidency. This was our original stand. But later we changed our stands to be in the national band wagon with the political parties and civil movements such as that led by Ven. Sobitha those wanted executive presidency abolished. The minorities in this country obtained whatever the rights and arrangements in force today in this country were agreed upon during the tenures of the presidents J.R. Jayawardene, R. Premadasa and Chandrika Bandaranayke Kumaratunga. Despite this fact we stood with national mainstream that wanted executive presidency out.

When we understood and agreed to play with the rest, what is happening today is pathetic. We feel betrayed. The majority parties and forces fail to understand the sentiments of the minority parties. The current PR electoral system is the best system that has paved way not only for minority parties but also for the minor parties. We agree on the shortcomings of the current system. They have to be rectified. But such rectification should not lead to large blunders in haste. 

We call upon all those who campaign for the electoral reforms to let the next elections to be held under the current system. Any new system need to address our fears. We need further discussions. Besides the voters need to be given reasonable time to understand the new system. We cannot agree to the private agendas of certain big parties those wanted reform to suit their own ends.

We will seek legal intervention to stop any unilateral actions on this subject. The minority and minor parties are meeting on Sunday evening in Colombo to formulate our common stand on this all important issue of electoral reform and our plan of action.

Lotus Tower construction to continue
	
Following a meeting held with officials of the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), the Urban Development Authority (UDA) had agreed to resolve the issue of the acquisition of land for the Lotus Tower within three months.
Earlier, the Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said that the land at D. R. Wijewardena Mawatha in Colombo 10 on which the Lotus Tower was being built was owned by the SLPA and that there were no documents to confirm that land had been acquired for the project.
However, the construction of the tower is nearing completion.
The Director General of the TRCSL, M.M. Zuhair said that in this regard the Cabinet had taken a decision to allow the UDA to resolve the land acquisition order.
Accordingly, officials of the three state institutions and the representatives of the Moratuwa University had met at the construction site of the tower two weeks ago, where the UDA had agreed to finalise the land acquisition in three months.
The SLPA, UDA and the TRCSL agreed to allow the UDA to take care of the matter. Since the land is state owned, the UDA had been instructed to make any extra payments if the SLPA had made improvements to the land on behalf of the TRCSL, Zuhair said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
