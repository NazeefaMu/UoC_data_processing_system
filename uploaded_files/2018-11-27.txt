A brief history of our cup of tea

No one really knows how tea originated
?
The tea plant, known as Camellia thea or Thea sinensis, is not indigenous to Sri Lanka. It comes in two varieties: the Chinese (Bohea) and the Indian (Virindis). The former has a hard leaf and grows in the shape of a low bush or hedge, while the latter can develop into a forest tree with a large glossy leaf. A hardy plant, it thrives under the most diverse and intense conditions of soil, climate, elevation, and treatment.?
No one really knows how tea originated. Legend has it that a Chinese Emperor, Shennong, decreed that his subjects must boil water before drinking it. Somewhere in 2737 BC, leaves from a nearby tree blew into his water, and the Emperor, so it goes, was pleasantly surprised and proceeded to drink the concoction. A variant of this has it that he tested the medical properties of herbs and found tea to work as an antidote; in any case, there?s no denying that it was an Asian, specifically a Chinese, beverage.?
It came to Europe around the same time Europe discovered alcohol, and it came, Fernand Braudel tells us, with two other beverages: coffee from Arabia, originally Ethiopia, and chocolate from Mexico. Importing it was difficult, however, since leaves, pots, and porcelain cups had to be imported as well.?
The first cargo of the beverage reached Amsterdam somewhere in 1610 on the initiative of Oost Indische Compagnie. Even then, it took a long time for other parts of the continent to acquire a taste for it: in France, the drink was not mentioned until 1635, and it provoked hostility to such an extent that in 1648, a medical student had to defend a thesis he?d written on it. 10 years later though, another thesis, written this time under the patronage of a tea loving chancellor, extolled its taste.?
The British East India Company began importing it from Asia in 1669. Until direct trade between Europe and China resumed in 1720-1730 (in the reigns of Yongzheng and Kangxi), however, tea consumption didn?t become significant in Europe, and when it found its way to London, England overtook the Dutch. The figures Braudel quotes seemingly testify to this: in 1766, exports from Canton amounted to 15 million pounds, and of them, six million were to Great? Britain. A popular legend has it that the drink became more addictive than gin, the poor man?s alcohol, and became an antidote to drunkenness during the reign of George II.?
In any case, it gained widespread popularity, especially after gin was subjected to heavy taxation in 1751 and grain prices began to rise soon afterwards; both these factors, Braudel surmises, may have favoured the newcomer.?
I am not, however, inclined to believe everything Braudel writes, in particular because he writes, in the first volume of Civilisation and Capitalism, that the first shrubs in Ceylon were planted in 1877, after coffee had been destroyed. It is true that until tea took over, coffee monopolised our economy (or rather, the economy the British had instituted here). But it was not planted here for the first time (as a commercial crop) in 1877; it was planted in 1841 by the youngest of three Austrian brothers related to the Rothschild family, though because of the monopoly coffee exerted over the economy, along with high labour and production costs, the venture did not succeed and become profitable. Even if we discount this historical fact though, 1877 is still the wrong year; 1867 would be more correct, since that is the year in which the other two brothers opened a clearing at Ramboda in the Labookelle Estate.?
The Labookelle Estate was a venture of the de Worms brothers, Solomon and Gabriel (The third brother, who had tried to plant tea in 1841, was Maurice.) At the same time, clearings were made at two other places: the Penylan Estate in Dolosbage and the Loolecondera Estate in Hewaheta. James Taylor was in charge of the latter site, which became the first commercial plantation of the crop in the island.?
Teas from Loolecondera were sold in 1872, and the first consignment reached Great Britain around one year later. In 1876, the first broking firm in Ceylon, John Brothers and Co., was established, and in 1883, the first public auction, held under the guidance of the Chamber of Commerce, was unveiled in Colombo.?
Demand picked up very rapidly thereafter. From 10 acres in 1867, production expanded to 4,700 acres in 1878, 32,000 acres in 1883, 364,000 acres in 1898, and 418,135 acres in 1924. By the turn of the 19th century, more than 384,000 acres had been cultivated, mostly by individual proprietors. Once these proprietors retired, they sold their estates to limited liability companies; by 1924, more than 71 per cent of the total tea acreage was owned by these companies, with more than 67 per cent of them registered in Great Britain. The most prominent local entrepreneur who had opted to venture into production during this time, moreover, happened to be the wealthiest Ceylonese of the 19th century: Charles Henry de Soysa.?
The 19th century did not face many challenges when it came to tea?s monopoly over local and regional trade. The 20th century was a different kettle of fish altogether. The first challenge came from a glut in the market due to supplies from other countries. Ceylonese tea, which writers from Mark Twain to Conan Doyle had extolled, enjoyed an unassailable position in the world market, but even this was not enough for it to withstand the shock of prices falling down to unprofitable levels. The fall led to an increase in the tea drinking habit among Europeans, a trend that was aggravated by a crafty, well designed, successful propaganda carried on by a group of merchants and traders that called itself the Thirty Committee. Owing to the work of this committee, consumption overtook demand, the glut was addressed, and prices began to pick up. A cess that had been imposed on the export of the product was, owing to the resurgence of the product, discontinued on December 31, 1908.?
Barely 10 years passed, however, before another problem presented itself. Stocks of tea accumulated in the United? Kingdom in the war years were suddenly released in 1920, which exerted a severe downward pressure on prices. Ceylon?s growers, as a response, restricted production, and as before, the industry recovered: by 1921, the quality of the product had risen considerably, thanks to advances in cultivation.?
Because of the tremendous pressure on Ceylon?s growers to keep up with other tea producing countries, science was resorted to, facilitating improvements in plantation and cultivation methods. This went hand in hand with the establishment of various societies: the Tea Planters? Association in 1854, the Tea Traders? Association in 1894, the Tea Research Institute in 1925, the Ceylon Estate Employers? Federation in 1944, and, following the change of government from the capitalistic UNP to the more left-of-centre SLFP, the State Plantations Corporation in 1958.?
All this bolstered the position of Ceylon tea, and in 1965 (the year of transition from the SLFP?s populist nationalism to the UNP?s liberal capitalism) the country became the world?s largest exporter of the crop for the first time. By this time, local growers had begun to cultivate the vegetatively propagated (clonal) variety instead of the seedlings, shortening the maturity period from five to three years.?
A period of intense political shifts followed, which had a say in the evolution of the industry: a spate of takeovers of local and foreign enterprises by the government of the seventies (which limited land ownership to 50 acres), and, partly under a government headed by the daughter of the prime minister who had sanctioned and overseen those takeovers, the restoration of estates to private management in the nineties.?
?
Today, the tea industry is not faring well, since it has consistently failed to keep its share of overseas markets, particularly black tea, despite global demand rising by five per cent per year. More than anything, this has to do with the fact that replanting was abandoned after the Ranasinghe Premadasa and Chandrika Kumaratunga Governments privatised the estates. Obviously, then, the future does not look that rosy.?
Mark Twain writes, in his travelogue Following the Equator, of a fellow traveller who observes that tea has a return of investment of 40 per cent: typical of the golden era of cultivation in Sri Lanka perhaps, but a far cry from today?s statistics. Whichever way you look at it though, the beverage remains our only true export brand. To abandon it and focus on other crops, as some market-oriented economists have recommended, would be (as a friend of mine recently put it) unwise and short-sighted.?
The writings of Fernand Braudel (?Civilisation and Capitalism?) and E. C. Elliot and F. J. Whitehead (?Tea Planting in Ceylon?), among others, were used for this article.

A brute disciplining children!
	
There is a principal of a school in a remote locality in Rajarata who is said to be deriving a sadistic pleasure by severely punishing the children even for a very minor offence like being a little late to school.
Complaints made against this Principal to Police or the higher education authorities have failed to produce any positive response as this Principal is a close buddy of a powerful politico in the district, they say.
By the way, this Principal is said to have been transferred to this school as punishment following a disciplinary inquiry against him relating to the misuse of public funds.
Parents of children studying in this school are said to be poor peasants most of whom are victims of Chronic Kidney Disease and these children are severely punished if they attend school even a few minutes late.
A report says that this Principal caned a child until he collapsed unconsciously for being ten minutes late to school.? In this instance, the child had got late to school as he had to accompany his father to a kidney disease treatment clinic.? ?

A nation so divided !
	
?
Premier Rajapaksa (Left) and? President Sirisena are faced with many challenges?
?
The forces who love and promote democracy are in a way divided
	Rajapaksa has requested from the people to show him the same support which they offered during the war
	We tell our citizens that they must learn to coexist with anyone despite having different views
	We scream for a united, free and peaceful Sri Lanka
?
There was some hope for Sri Lanka when the majority within the parliament came together to move a no-confidence motion against the Sirisena-Rajapaksa Government. But togetherness seems to have been temporary with both the TNA and the JVP making it clear that they wish to be no part of a broad alliance that the UNP wishes to form in the future.
In other words the forces who love and promote democracy are in a way divided; hence a divided Sri Lanka!This nature in Sri Lankans to be divided has cost the island dearly. Just imagine how helpless the present government is when one knows that it can?t pass even a simple bill in parliament because the people?s representatives within are so divided.?
Nine years ago the majority of Sri Lankans stood behind the Government?s efforts to crush a rebel uprising in the north and the east. Those were hard times for us and Sri Lankans decided to grin and bear when the cost of living rose sharply. Rajapaksa finished the war and the people showed their gratitude by voting for him again to make him the president for the second time. Nine years later this most popular parliamentarian to emerge from the south has to remind people about the war that he finished in his present attempts to win their support. In a recent statement he has requested from the people to show him the same support which they offered during the war to rebuild this nation. He has warned that this could be the final chance for them to do so and save the country.?
?
At present, rather than looking for ways of pulling the country out of this political mess, the Government and the opposition are interpreting the Constitution in different ways for political gains
Big egos
Despite the experience he carries in politics and the popularity he basks in, premier Rajapaksa has to rely on ?war heroics? to garner support for future elections. Most Sri Lankans are trying to put the whole war in the ?forget file? and look to the future, but the man wearing the ?satakaya? (shawl) wants to recall war memories and use them to his advantage. Then in this context the police should not have requested form the Kopay Magistrate to issue an injunction order to prevent Jaffna University Students from holding their ?Mahaviru Samaruma? . This is because if war memories are important to Rajapaksa so are they to the Tamil Community whose members lost their loved ones during the civil war.?
Whether we like it or not, Sri Lankans have the tendency to be divided. Whether it is a struggle between the rich and poor, the elite and the down trodden masses, the Sinhalese and Muslims and finally those who value democracy and those who demand economic progress at the expense of democracy, what surfaces is that we Sri Lankans are constantly in search of ways to oppose each other. In other words we have big egos which are bigger that the need to collect the pieces of this shattered nation, put them together and move forward.?
We are a multi-religious, multi-ethnic and multi-cultural country. But we don?t look into any of these when we admit students to our local universities. The only criterion for admission to university is the Z Score and the education authorities are very fair in discharging their duties. But within the universities ragging takes place. And most of these ragging sessions are carried out with the view to even out social disparities. However, all are equal when they graduate, but their names, places of birth and ones pride (Nama, gama and adambarakama) are built in features and surface when these graduates enter the job market, get promoted within organisations and become decision makers. Once out of campus they are greatly influenced by the divided society, again. This division has cost us heavily.?
One reason for the political mess in the country is President Sirisena breaking off ties with the former prime minister Wickremesinge. Sirisena affirmed that he didn?t fancy Wickremesinghe?s work culture. He also underscored the fact that the two were culturally poles apart.?
At present, rather than looking for ways of pulling the country out of this political mess, the Government and the opposition are interpreting the Constitution in different ways for political gains. UNP parliamentarian Lakshman Kiriella has said that ?the House is bound to follow Section 7 of the Parliament Power and Privileges Act which says the House is bound to follow the tradition of ?House of Commons? when the country?s Constitution is unclear?. But unfortunately this proposal is unlikely to receive the corporation of the majority in parliament.?
In this context it?s important to mention the fact that presidential polls are fiercely contested in the United States of America, but when the winner is found everybody cooperates to push the country and the economy in one direction. This is what?s lacking in Sri Lanka; after most presidential elections.?
The presidential polls in 2015 progressed peacefully and the transition of power from Rajapaksa to Sirisena happened rather smoothly. Sirisena had a cracking start, after being sworn in three and half years ago. But the healthy start he had hit a snag soon because of the differences he had with Wickremesinghe. We tell our citizens that they must learn to coexist with anyone despite having different views. This lesson must be taught to both Wickremesinghe and Sirisena; the latter most importantly because he is the head of state and must set an example to the others.?
Right and wrong
It?s in this context that many opine that Sirisena should have found a way in which he could have worked together with Wickremesinghe, despite the differences, till 2020. His breaking away from the unity government, formed in 2015, has put the island nation under tremendous strain financially.?
Right now all parliamentarians are bracing for a crucial debate that will take place on November 27 and 29 to discuss a motion brought by the UNP to stop Government spending. If this motion is passed with the support of the majority we would be in for more trouble. This is because that would mean the Government would not be capable of passing a simple bill in parliament in the future due to the opposition forming the majority.?
?
Despite the experience he carries in politics and the popularity he basks in, premier Rajapaksa has to rely on ?war heroics? to garner support for future elections
From the two voices that are echoing, the ones of Rajapaksa and Sirisena are heard loud and clear. Premier Rajapaksa supports a general election and sees that as the right choice even if he doesn?t see that the way in which he was elected as prime minister was wrong. Wickremesinghe sees the stance he has taken in not critisising Sirisena at public forums as right, but fails to see the decisions he took to ?sell? government assets to other nations as wrong. We scream for a united, free and peaceful Sri Lanka. Achieving this seems to remain a fantasy given that Sri Lankans are divided so profoundly; for example when we know that these islanders need to have a debate to chose between right and wrong.?
The constant debate about what?s good and bad has suddenly turned very ugly!

## Title: Cabinet approves Vote on Account to draw money to run Govt

Cabinet approves Vote on Account to draw money to run Govt
	
The Cabinet today approved a ?Vote on Account? (VoA) for the government to cover State expenses for the time being and it would be presented in Parliament shortly for approval, Government Spokesman and Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said today.
Minister Samarasinghe noted that the government did not have a problem on the government expenditure for the rest of 2018 as the funds had been already allocated from the Budget 2018 and through the Appropriation Bill and therefore the VoA would be to allocate funds for the first three months of 2019.
Addressing the weekly SLFP news briefing at the party office, Minister Samarasinghe said the President had powers to obtain funds from the Consolidated Fund for State expenditure for three months if and when an election was declared but that fund allocation had to be approved soon after Parliament met.
Meanwhile, Minister Samarasinghe said the government's parliamentary group would decide today whether to participate in the debate on the motion tomorrow, handed over by the Opposition seeking to curtail allocations for the Office of the Prime Minister.
?First of all we must decide whether this motion could be tabled in Parliament as it questions the actions taken by President Sirisena and releasing of two presidential gazette notifications.
Vocational Training and Skills Development and Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera interjected to say that he asked Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to consult the Attorney General on the motion as he was in the opinion that the motion was subjudice.
?The tradition and the process of separation of power dictates that the legislature and judiciary does not trespass each others territory. Here, there was clear evidence that the motion has done that mistake, Therefore, I think Parliament cannot entertain this motion in the first place,? Minister Jayasekera said.
Commenting on the remarks made by the Chairman of the UNP, parliamentarian Kabir Hashim on allegations levelled against former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe before foreign correspondents at the week ends by President Sirisena, Minister Samarasinghe said President Sirisena had never criticized Mr. Wickremesinghe singularly.
?President Sirisena explained to foreign correspondents the challenges he confronted during the ?Yahapalana Regime since 2015 and corruption he had to endure, that included the biggest ever fraud in the State sector, the central bank bond scam, bringing the Finance Ministry and the Central Bank under Ranil, the privatization scandal of the Hilton Hotel and Grand Hyatt ? Colombo, selling of Edirisinghe Trust Investment Company to a foreign bidder bypassing a local investor who offered a higher bid etc are a few to name as large scale corruptions that took place under the previous regime,? Minister Samarasinghe stressed.
Minister Samarasinghe pointed out that his friend, Mr. Hashim had said in his statement that President Sirisena had talked about a Wickremesinghe government it was totally wrong and President Sirisen had never mentioned about a Wickremesinghe government.
?When President Sirisena said he would not appoint Mr. Wickremesinghe in his life time as the Prime Minister that was only an average statement in the oft used vernacular parlance. All subject Ministers of the ?Yahapalana Government? must individually take the responsibility for the shady deals that took place under them. President Sirisena is going to take most appropriate step on these alleged corruptions by appointing a Commission of Inquiry which we will support fully,? he stressed.
Minister Samarasinghe said no one could put the blame on the current economic, political and social dilemma on the doorstep of the current regime as it is only one month old and all misdeeds were done in the last three and half years. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Commission must be impartial: Champika
	
There was nothing wrong in appointing a Presidential Commission to probe into alleged corruptions that had taken from 2015 to 2018 but it should not be done to victimise people politically, UNP MP Patali Champika Ranawaka said yesterday.
Mr Ranawaka told a media briefing that any Commission that would be appointed should be an impartial one.
He was referring to a statement made by President Maithripala Sirisena on Sunday that he would be appointing a Presidential Commission to probe into corruptions during the last three years.
?There is nothing wrong in appointing a Commission to probe corruption that might have taken place during the last three years but it should be an impartial one,? Mr Ranawaka said.
Referring to another statement made by the President that former Minister Sagala Ratnayake sabotaged an investigation, the UNP MP said legal action should be taken against Mr. Ratnayake if the President was making such an allegation.
?We know what happened with the investigations with regard to Avant Garde, the killing of Thajudeen and Lasantha Wickramatunga,? Mr Ranawaka added.
?The President should have taken action against anyone who sabotaged investigations then as he was the head of Cabinet and the Head of State,? he said.
Mr Ranawaka said the political crisis could hamper Sri Lanka?s GDP growth by 4.6 percent.
The crisis he said would result in increase of the debt each individual owes to other countries by Rs. 30,000.
Meanwhile, UNP MP Mujibur Rahman, who held a media briefing later said the President should remember that he would be appointing a Commission to probe corruption that had taken place under a Government which he headed. (Yohan Perera)

Gammanpila accuses Speaker of altering Hansard content
	
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) Leader Udaya Gammanpila yesterday accused Speaker Karu Jayasuriya of altering the contents of the Hansard, which recorded what has happened in parliament chamber during the no-confidence motion debate on November 14.
Minister Gammanpila said there were changes between the unedited copy of November 14 Hansard which he recently obtained and the official copy issued on November 23.
?According to the video footage of the November 14 parliament session, the Speaker says he would take up the vote by voice. He says there is no majority for the new government. In his words, the speaker says ?there is no majority for that?. The unedited version of Hansard include all these quotations. However, the copy issued later on includes the altered phrase "There is no majority for that, for them" and also a newly added phrase called "the motion is carried". Therefore, Speaker has altered the Hansard in favour of the UNP," he told a news briefing.
He said the act of forging documents is a punishable offence which amounts to an imprisonment up to three years. ?We expect to lodge a complaint to the Fraud Investigation Bureau on Tuesday over this,? he said.
Meanwhile, the minister said the Supreme Court has not made a decision to give an order on the parliament dissolution case on December 7 as claimed by many. He said the case would be heard on December 4,5 and 6.
?Therefore, a stay order was issued till 7th. The date of the ruling would be announced on the evening of 6th. It could be 7th, 10th or any other day," he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Got a beating for not minding his business!
	
A Coordinating Secretary of a political heavyweight was badly roughed up by an angry crowd on the day the posse of Policemen had to protect the chair of the august assembly.
?
An attempt by him to enter the chamber earlier along with his boss had been foiled. However, when the political heavyweight was coming out, the man had rushed to his side and presenting himself as a protective shield, had tried to prevent others from even talking to him. Angered by his high-handed manner, some of the crowd had violently treated the man, they say.
The secretary had later protested that he was only trying to protect his boss, but his unsympathetic colleagues had told him, ?You got what you really deserved!?

Jute is now  decidedly upmarket It was a poor man?s fabric in the past

Inside a modern jute mill in Bangladesh
?
Known as the ?Golden fiber?, jute is grown in West Bengal and Bangladesh
	Jute is said to be the cheapest and the most economical vegetable fiber after cotton
	Grown during the monsoon, the jute crop rotates with rice to restore soil fertility
	Jute became a commercial product only in the 17th Century
	The British also found out the means to soften the hard and brittle nature of jute fiber by adding oil and water
	By June 1981, the state-run Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation (BJMC) had 74 mills under it
?
Typically associated with the crude ?gunny bag? used in the bazaars of the Indian sub-continent, jute is now very much up-market with an amazing variety of fashionable products being turned out from the fiber.
This was evident at the Bangladesh stall in the Xmas Charity Bazaar held at Galle Face Hotel in Colombo on Sunday.
?In just four hours most of the articles on display were sold out,? remarked Riaz Hamidullah, High Commissioner of Bangladesh.
?Exported mostly to the West, even Bangladeshis may not have seen these high quality products,? he said as he pointed to a wide range of bags, rugs, containers and household decorative products on display.? They were colourful, and soft and intricate even as they were tough.
One was amased to hear that there are now ?jute saris.? Western fashion designers are now using jute as a fabric. They are used for furnishing in passenger jets and automobiles made in France and Germany, and in homes as rugs, bags and containers.
A Bangladeshi designer has developed the ?Sonali Bag? or the Golden Bag, which ought to replace the environmentally unfriendly polythene bag, because it is biodegradable, Hamidullah said.
Bengalis in the Indian State of West Bengal and in Bangladesh, had discovered the virtues of jute long before the rest of the world. The traditional Bangladeshi ?Satranji? mats are made of jute.
?Jute curtains are used to beat the heat because jute is a heat insulator. The military can use it to make camouflage? jackets as they look like grass. The Bangladesh jute industry has identified 250 industrial and commercial applications of jute,? Hamidullah said.? ? ? ? ?
Known as the ?Golden fiber?, jute is grown in West Bengal and Bangladesh, but mostly in Bangladesh. Rangpur, Bogra, Tippera, Pabna,? Dhaka, Faridpur,? Rajshahi, Jessore, Nadia (10%) and Dinajpur districts in Bangladesh and Hughli district in West Bengal (India) are known for jute cultivation.
Jute is said to be the cheapest and the most economical vegetable fiber after cotton. It is obtained from the skin or bast of the jute plant?s stem. Literature on it says that jute is a recyclable, 100% biodegradable and eco-friendly product which has low extensibility and high tensile strength.
Grown during the monsoon, the jute crop rotates with rice to restore soil fertility. The leaves of the jute plant enrich the fertility of the soil. Use of jute sticks as fuel and fencing material as substitute for wood prevents deforestation. Given the increasing global concern for the environment, the future prospects for jute are high, Hamidullah said.
Jute?s Hoary Past
In medieval Mughal era in India, jute was the poor man?s dress material. In ancient Bengal, jute was used to make ropes and twines, and in China, it was used to make paper.
Prior to the establishment of the first jute mill in India in 1855, handloom weavers used jute fiber to make twines, ropes, coarse fabrics for the poor, and also for fishing and for mooring vessels.
Jute became a commercial product only in the 17th Century, when Europeans recognized its value. The British East India Company (EIA) which established itself in the Indian sub-continent, first as traders and then as rulers, made jute a major item of international trade.??
The EIC began by trading in raw jute.? The first consignment of jute was exported to England in 1793. In? Scotland, flax spinners were trying to find out if jute can be mechanically processed. Flax, also known as linseed, is a food and fiber crop cultivated in cooler regions of the world. Textiles made from flax are known in the West as linen, and are used as bed sheets, underclothes, and as table cloth.
In 1830, flax spinners in Dundee spun jute? yarn by transfiguring their power driven flax machinery.
The British also found out the means to soften the hard and brittle nature of jute fiber by adding oil and water. This made the fiber more pliable and easily separable, and resulted in the production of a usable thread.
This led to an increase in the production and export of raw jute from Bengal which at that time was the sole supplier of raw jute.
First Jute Factory In India
George Acland from Dundee in Scotland set up the first power driven jute weaving factory in India at Rishra on the River Hooghly near Calcutta in year 1855. As coal was mined nearby, power was available.
By 1869, five mills had been set up with almost 1000 looms. And by 1910, there were 38 companies with 30,685 looms, rendering more than a billion yards of cloth and over 450 million bags. Come 1939, there were 68,377 looms on the banks of the River Hooghly near Calcutta. Their products ranged from coarse bags to finer fabrics known as hessian or burlap.??
In 1900-1, the export value of jute manufactures accounted for nearly a third of the entire export from Bengal. Half the industrial workforce in Bengal was in the jute industry.
In sixty years between 1880 and 1940, the number of mills increased five times, that of looms by 14 times, of spindles by 19 times, and of persons employed by 11 times.
Historical Factors
In 1838, the Dutch Government wanted bags made of jute instead of flax for carrying coffee from the East Indies (now Indonesia) to Europe. When the Crimean War of 1854-56 led to the stoppage of flax supplies from Russia, Dundee factories were forced to look for substitutes. The American Civil War (1861-65) gave further impetus to the jute trade, as supplies of American cotton had dwindled. World War I and II kept the industry up in the 20 th.Century.
Calcutta and Dundee became ?jute cities?. The owners of the jute mills in Dundee came to be known as ?Jute Barons? and the British-owned newspapers in Calcutta came to be known as the ?Jute Press? because they were funded by money made in the jute industry.
Growth After Independence
When India and Pakistan gained independence in 1947, (Bangladesh was known as East Pakistan then), the British jute barons yielded place to the Marwari community in India and to West Pakistan-based businessmen like the Bawanis, Adamjees, Dauds? and Ispahanis in East Pakistan.
After East Pakistan separated from Pakistan to become an independent Bangladesh in 1971, the West Pakistanis abandoned their factories and fled. The new Bangladesh government had to take over the factories, though they were privatized later.??
By June 1981, the state-run Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation (BJMC) had 74 mills under it. These mills employed 165,000 workers and 27,000 managerial and office staff. In 1982, the industry was privatized, and with World Bank aid, began to make profits.
Despite diversification, jute is still the backbone of the Bangladesh economy. Nearly 15 million farmers are involved in growing jute and several million more, perhaps another 15 million, are involved in the processing, transportation, conversion of the crop into useful products, for both domestic use and export to the upmarket outlets in the West.? ?.?

Leo Burnett the only Sri Lankan agency to win metal at Epica Awards 2018
	
Leo Burnett Sri Lanka alongside Leo Burnett Toronto was bestowed with 2 coveted metals at the celebrated Epica awards held recently. The agency won Silver for ?Product Design? and a Bronze for ?Household Maintenance? categories for its campaign for Petal Paint in close partnership with client JAT Holdings. The Epica awards aim to reward outstanding creativity and help agencies, production companies, media consultancies, and photographers and design studios to develop their reputations beyond their national borders, attracting thousands of entries from more than 70 countries.
Established in 1987, Epica is unique in the crowded awards sector as it is the only prize judged by journalists working for marketing and communications titles. More than 200 magazines and websites from around the world are on the Epica jury.
Petal Paint is a unique paint that has been created with the pigments from dried flower petals and transformed into liquid paint for restoration and maintenance of temple art. The Petal Paint campaign achieved several pioneering goals with its launch - it reuses thousands of flowers offered by devotees at temples; this has a beneficial impact on the environment as otherwise the dried flowers are discarded and sent to landfills; and the product is imbued with a spiritual quality since it contains temple flowers transformed into paint to restore murals in temples with traditional hues. Amidst the impermanence of floral offerings, this petal paint marks permanence as it adorns revered murals in temples.??
The award-winning Creative Campaign consisted of extracting the pigment contained in temple flower offerings to create a range of safe, long-lasting paints and use them for the creation and restoration of temple art. The flower offerings are collected from various temples across Colombo and taken through a drying process, after which their natural pigments are extracted to create Petal Paint. The former Managing Director of Leo Burnett Sri Lanka, Ranil de Silva, was instrumental in conceptualizing the campaign and helping the team to execute it till its successful conclusion.??
Elaborating further, Richard Gunawardene - Head of Marketing at JAT Holdings said, ?At JAT Holdings, we espouse a strong commitment to sustainable practices and protection of the environment through our products. Petal Paint was certainly a global first, which re-imagined temple flowers as petal paint to restore temple art. We are proud to combine ancient traditions and cutting-edge manufacturing technology to emerge with such a unique concept. Leo Burnett has been an exceptional partner in this journey and Petal Paint is a testimonial to the power of a great idea underscored by a strong sustainability element. We are thrilled to have the Petal Paint campaign recognized and rewarded on an international stage at Epica awards.?
Arosha Perera, CEO of Leo Burnett Sri Lanka, said, ?The Petal Paint concept is capturing attention globally and this triumph at the revered Epica awards is yet another reflection of just how fresh and unique this campaign was. This product truly seals in tradition, culture, religion and spirituality in a can. We maintained the temple art theme in the packaging which depicts temple designs so that the product stands apart on the shelves. JAT Holdings is a company ahead of its time for implementing this novel product as a way to give back to society. Kudos to both teams from Leo Burnett and JAT Holdings for bringing petal paint to fruition. We expect this campaign will go down in history as an out-of-the-box and yet a simple translation of a sustainable creative concept.?
Leo Burnett has become a crucible for creativity and great thinking, producing to be executed in a fresh, relevant and insightful manner to add value to clients? brands.The agency conveyed the sustainable and eco-friendly benefits of this unique paint through a touching campaign which evoked the culture and heritage of Sri Lanka in a beautiful manner. As Leo Burnett celebrates its 19th year of operations in Sri Lanka and looks ahead to the future, the agency will continue to focus on its Human Kind approach to help build powerful brands and meaningful partnerships with its clients, while delivering gratifying results and gaining peer recognition in the industry.

Looming prospect of  targeted sanctions:  How appropriate are they ?
	
?
Not long ago, the stooges of Mahinda Rajapaksa, and MR himself, spewed some fanciful justifications for the contested ( and obviously unethical) sacking of Ranil Wickremesinghe, and MR?s appointment as prime minister in one Friday night quirk by President Maithripala Sirisena.
One argument was that MR was appointed to salvage the crumbling economy. That Ranil though had a vision, was a poor implementer of his own economic policies provided some credence to the claims of saturation of economy during his tenure. However, MR, the purported prime minister for over a month, has presided over an accelerated economic collapse. The Rupee continues to depreciate under his watch, hitting yesterday, the all-time low of Rs.181against the US$. The initial depreciation of rupee during the previous months correlated to a world-wide trend of emerging market currency depreciation against the Benchmark as a result of rising interest rates and boost in Capital investment in America. However, the current slump of the Rupee is taking place while other emerging market currencies are appreciating against the Dollar.
Soon after his appointment as the Prime Minister cum Finance Minister MR tried to stall rupee depreciation by selling the foreign reserves. That momentarily halted the slump, but, after burning hard earned dollar reserves, the rupee is continuing its downward spiral. Still, the government of MR is not short of clowns. Trade Minister Bandula Gunawardene claims that plans are afoot to boost the rupee to reach a ratio of Rs.160 a US$. When quacks rule the roost, a nation is forced to live a big economic lie. That is until it bursts.
However, this false complacency cannot last longer. Last week, International credit rating agency, Moody?s downgraded Sri Lanka?s sovereign debt; IMF delayed the release of US $ 250 million fifth tranche of a US $ 1.5 billion IMF extended loan facility , ?pending political clarity?.
In an interview with Kelum Bandara of this newspaper, German Ambassador J?rn Rohde,who had been vocal, (rightly so), of Sri Lanka?s deliberately inflicted political impasse , spoke eloquently of the economic loss impacted upon on the country by the current crisis.
In the Down South, hoteliers complain that 30% of pre-booking orders have been cancelled. Tellingly, all that is after the Lonely Planet named Sri Lanka as the best travel destination for 2019. There is a looming danger of the suspension of GSP Plus trade concessions. The agreement on a US$ 460 million grant by the Millennium Challenge Cooperation, which was to be signed in December is likely to be delayed. A Japanese concessionary loan for the Colombo mono rail project could well suffer the same fate. In the meantime, the government has turned to China for another US $ 500 million loan to finance debt repayment.
?
German envoy J?rn Rohde was vocal, (rightly so), of Sri Lanka?s deliberately inflicted political impasse, spoke eloquently of the economic loss impacted upon on the country by the current crisis
The full scale of unfolding catastrophe is not yet felt , partly due to the Western countries that had rebuilt the bridges with Sri Lanka during the Yahapalana government, are still reluctant to burn them. The measured tone of international concerns also underpins the geopolitical interests especially of Japan, India and the United States, at a time China is salivating at an opportunity to reclaim its influence. Pushing Messrs. Sirisena and MR to the corner would force the duo to turn to China for a sense of legitimacy, ego boost and hard cash.
However, whether the West?s rewarding of an illegitimate government would serve their long term interests, and also Sri Lanka?s domestic interests of democracy is open to question. Mollycoddling the current regime, which has refused to accept the verdict of a Parliamentary majority, would only embolden intransigence. The government that lacks legitimacy back home, sooner or later would lose legitimacy in the eyes of the civilized world. That in turn would push the regime further into the embrace of authoritarian states. After all, there is an observable correlation between the extent of democratic values of the ruling elites, and the trajectory of their foreign policies and their rapport with the democratic world.
If the constitutional coup persists against saner advice, the international community would lose patience at some point and cut Sri Lanka lose. However, the government would characterize such international measures, especially the economic ones, as part of a broader anti-Sri Lankan conspiracy. Retrograde nationalism and gutter fanaticism would be mobilized to legitimize an undemocratic regime and intimidate its opponents. Sinister tactics of intimidation of not so long ago would be reincarnated. The recent apparently politically instructed release of the suspects of anti-Muslim violence in Digana and rejuvenation of BBS are torch bearers of a government strategy which would come into action in the near future.
There is also a looming prospect that the Western nations may go for targeted sanctions against the key protagonists of the purported government and their immediate families. That would include travel embargoes and asset freeze. The US State Department has on multiple occasions frozen assets of cronies of Kremlin and members of ruling cohorts of Venezuela, Nicaragua and Iran?s Red Guard, among others. The recent silence of MR?s American passport-holding siblings is reportedly attributed to these concerns.
Targeted sanctions on the regime elites are a far more effective tool in taming them, than indiscriminate economic sanctions. That is because politics in this part of the world is a hostage to the personal ambitions of the ruling elite. The current crisis itself is a product of that dynamic. Degenerative effect of such personalized political gambles can best be tackled by targeting what those opportunistic elites hold dear to their hearts, i.e. their selfish interest, much less the national interest. Such measures would also have a far reaching delegitimizing effect; regional leaders who otherwise hobnob, would be dissuaded to do so. Even the electorate would be less inclined to elect such personalities.
Tagging a pariah as a pariah, rather than the country as a whole is what the international community should resort to if it is short of options on Sri Lanka.

## Title: NASA InSight Lander arrives on Martian surface

NASA InSight Lander arrives on Martian surface
	
Mars has just received its newest robotic resident. NASA's Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) lander successfully touched down on the Red Planet after an almost seven-month, 300-million-mile (458-million-kilometer) journey from Earth.
InSight's two-year mission will be to study the deep interior of Mars to learn how all celestial bodies with rocky surfaces, including Earth and the Moon, formed.
InSight launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California May 5. The lander touched down Monday, Nov. 26, near Mars' equator on the western side of a flat, smooth expanse of lava called Elysium Planitia, at 11:52:59 a.m. PST (2:52:59 p.m. EST).
"Today, we successfully landed on Mars for the eighth time in human history," said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. "InSight will study the interior of Mars and will teach us valuable science as we prepare to send astronauts to the Moon and later to Mars. This accomplishment represents the ingenuity of America and our international partners, and it serves as a testament to the dedication and perseverance of our team. The best of NASA is yet to come, and it is coming soon."
The landing signal was relayed to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, via NASA's two small experimental Mars Cube One (MarCO) CubeSats, which launched on the same rocket as InSight and followed the lander to Mars. They are the first CubeSats sent into deep space. After successfully carrying out a number of communications and in-flight navigation experiments, the twin MarCOs were set in position to receive transmissions during InSight's entry, descent and landing.
"We hit the Martian atmosphere at 12,300 mph (19,800 kilometers per hour), and the whole sequence to touching down on the surface took only six-and-a-half minutes," said InSight project manager Tom Hoffman at JPL. "During that short span of time, InSight had to autonomously perform dozens of operations and do them flawlessly ? and by all indications that is exactly what our spacecraft did."
Confirmation of a successful touchdown is not the end of the challenges of landing on the Red Planet. InSight's surface-operations phase began a minute after touchdown. One of its first tasks is to deploy its two decagonal solar arrays, which will provide power. That process begins 16 minutes after landing and takes another 16 minutes to complete.
The InSight team expects a confirmation later Monday that the spacecraft's solar panels successfully deployed. Verification will come from NASA's Odyssey spacecraft, currently orbiting Mars. That signal is expected to reach InSight's mission control at JPL about five-and-a-half hours after landing.
"We are solar powered, so getting the arrays out and operating is a big deal," said Tom Hoffman at JPL. "With the arrays providing the energy we need to start the cool science operations, we are well on our way to thoroughly investigate what's inside of Mars for the very first time."
InSight will begin to collect science data within the first week after landing, though the teams will focus mainly on preparing to set InSight's instruments on the Martian ground. At least two days after touchdown, the engineering team will begin to deploy InSight's 5.9-foot-long (1.8-meter-long) robotic arm so that it can take images of the landscape.
"Landing was thrilling, but I'm looking forward to the drilling," said InSight principal investigator Bruce Banerdt of JPL. "When the first images come down, our engineering and science teams will hit the ground running, beginning to plan where to deploy our science instruments. Within two or three months, the arm will deploy the mission's main science instruments, the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS) and Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package (HP3) instruments."
InSight will operate on the surface for one Martian year, plus 40 Martian days, or sols, until Nov. 24, 2020. The mission objectives of the two small MarCOs which relayed InSight?s telemetry was completed after their Martian flyby.
"That's one giant leap for our intrepid, briefcase-sized robotic explorers," said Joel Krajewski, MarCO project manager at JPL. "I think CubeSats have a big future beyond Earth's orbit, and the MarCO team is happy to trailblaze the way."
With InSight's landing at Elysium Planitia, NASA has successfully soft-landed a vehicle on the Red Planet eight times.
"Every Mars landing is daunting, but now with InSight safely on the surface we get to do a unique kind of science on Mars," said JPL director Michael Watkins. "The experimental MarCO CubeSats have also opened a new door to smaller planetary spacecraft. The success of these two unique missions is a tribute to the hundreds of talented engineers and scientists who put their genius and labor into making this a great day."
JPL manages InSight for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. InSight is part of NASA's Discovery Program, managed by the agency's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. The MarCO CubeSats were built and managed by JPL. Lockheed Martin Space in Denver built the InSight spacecraft, including its cruise stage and lander, and supports spacecraft operations for the mission.
A number of European partners, including France's Centre National d'?tudes Spatiales (CNES) and the German Aerospace Center (DLR), are supporting the InSight mission. CNES, and the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris (IPGP), provided the SEIS instrument, with significant contributions from the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS) in Germany, the Swiss Institute of Technology (ETH) in Switzerland, Imperial College and Oxford University in the United Kingdom, and JPL. DLR provided the HP3 instrument, with significant contributions from the Space Research Center (CBK) of the Polish Academy of Sciences and Astronika in Poland. Spain's Centro de Astrobiolog?a (CAB) supplied the wind sensors. (mars.nasa.gov)

Opp. MPs request Speaker to order Media: 'There is no govt.'
	
Several opposition MPs today requested Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to order media to refrain from indicating that there is a government in the country at the moment in their news reports.
This request was made by MPs S. M. Marikkar, Hirunika Premachnadra and Rauff Hakeem.
?You have officially mentioned that there is no government, a Prime Minister or a Cabinet at the moment. Therefore, it is appropriate that you order them not to indicate that there is a government, a Cabinet and a Prime Minister. Media refer to Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister and calls others in UPFA as ministers. This is not correct as you have declared that there is no government at the moment while the official Hansard in Parliament had reported the same. Therefore you should order the media to change the ways they report,? Mr. Hakeem said.
Ms. Premachnadra said media should stop being servile to certain politicians.??(Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Politics here anathema to him!
	
A foreign Head of State deeply concerned over the current political crisis in this country had contacted over the phone a scion of a leading political clan now employed abroad and requested him to seriously consider entering politics in his motherland.
?
The foreign dignitary had also assured the young man of his country?s support to the latter if he took to politics here.
By the way, the young political clan member had not returned to the motherland even on a brief visit for several years, they say.
The young man had reportedly told the foreign dignitary that he would never take to politics in his mother country.

Prez orders to release Sinhala, Tamil translations of bond report: Dullas
	
President Maithripala Sirisena had instructed the relevant authorities to release the Tamil and Sinhala translations of the report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) into the Central Bank Bond scam within two weeks, UPFA MP Dallas Alahapperuma said today.
He told a news conference held at the parliament complex that the debate on the PCoI report was halted after TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran raised a question about non availability of the Sinhala, the Tamil translations of the report.
He said the previous government had prevented the translations from submitting in the House. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Romeo has become a nuisance to them!
	
A fresher-Diyawanna member has become a nuisance to the young fair staffers attached to the committee offices of the august assembly, they say.
?
This member has made it a habit to visit committee offices to while away time, chatting to the fair ones on duty and the latter have been forced to tolerate his presence out of sheer courtesy.
This worthy is said to be coming to the august assembly even on days the sittings are not held just for the pleasure of the company of the female staffers.
There had been an elderly purohita in the previous council who had been a similar nuisance to these female employees.?
So, they are now referring to their current source of annoyance as ?Aswer Two?, they say.

?
REUTERS, 26th NOVEMBER, 2018- Russia resisted international calls on Monday to release three Ukrainian naval ships that its border patrols had fired on and seized near Crimea at the weekend, triggering the most dangerous crisis in years between Moscow and Kiev.??
With relations still raw after Russia?s 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and its backing for a pro-Moscow insurgency in eastern Ukraine, the incident risks pushing the two countries towards a wider conflict and is likely to renew Western calls for more sanctions on Moscow.??
Russia?s FSB security service said its border patrol boats had seized two small Ukrainian armoured artillery vessels and a tugboat after opening fire on them and wounding several sailors on Sunday. It said it had opened a criminal case into what it called the ships? illegal entry into Russian territorial waters.??
A spokeswoman for the Russian foreign ministry, Maria Zakharova, accused Ukraine of sending the ships to deliberately provoke Russia and said the ranking diplomat at Kiev?s embassy in Moscow would be summoned over the incident.??
Kiev denied its ships had done anything wrong and accused Moscow of military aggression.?

## Title: Sex and sexuality issues  need discussion, not labels

Sex and sexuality issues  need discussion, not labels
	
Sex and sexuality ? two things which were very personal to both males and females- are no longer personal. The patriarchal cloud still hovers around the deeply grounded conservative background we Sri Lankans come from. Therefore even if a woman is constantly abused, she would rather keep quiet than let her voice be heard and become a topic of discussion. From domestic violence to gang rape, there have been many reported incidents of sexual harassment. This also means that many of these cases go unreported. ?When men see a pretty girl, squeezing, touching or holding her comes with a general sense of entitlement that men have within our culture which is mainly patriarchal,? said Hans Bilimoria, Director of the Grassrooted Trust in an interview with the Daily mirror.
?
?
As such the Daily Mirror sheds light on a few matters that concern sex and sexuality, the culture of shame and the immediate need for an educational reform mandate.?
Lonely island?
Lonely Planet recently ranked Sri Lanka as the number one destination for travel amid foreign women constantly facing various issues, the worst of them being rape. It wasn?t long before former Minister of Tourism John Amarathunga suggested that tourists need to be aware when travelling and that they shouldn't do so. ?This again points to the attitude towards women and especially foreign women,? Bilimoria continued.
Foreign women are always tricked into paying higher taxi fares and there have been reported cases where tuk tuk drivers were a threat to these women. Hence, an attempt was made to identify foreigner friendly scooter taxis (tuks). When asked whether such initiatives would help Bilimoria said that they would be successful as far as the drivers of these taxis are educated in treating the passengers. ?This could be anybody from a male, female or even a transgender person. The tuk driver should treat them equally without trying to exploit them. So it?s about educating the people who interact with tourists. For us it?s always about education,? he went on.?
Adding in her comments gender activist and writer Sharanya Sekaram, who also works as a programme manager at the Grassrooted Trust said that as a country, she has always found a competition. ?It?s not about solving our own problems. For example if we talk about rape we say at least we are not as bad as India, if we talk about female political participation we say that we had the first female prime minister, if we talk about women in the workplace we ask to look at these boards and societies headed by women. We are always defensive instead of addressing the fact that we are very much that. We don?t seem to admit that we have this problem,? she said.?
Culture of shame?
Although there are many incidents of sexual harassment, only a handful of cases are reported. ?If you take a man masturbating in a bus, people would think it is an isolated incident, but there?s enough evidence to prove that these are not isolated incidents,? Bilimoria emphasised. ?We also have a culture of shame beautifully embedded into us,? Sekaram added. ?Hence victims are asked why they didn?t stand up and fight back. There?s also a complete lack of faith in consequences because there are no consequences for the people. This is because there?s no confidence in law enforcement and response.? Shame has been embedded from the time you can walk ? from when we are seven years old we talk about dress codes in schools. Whenever they say that the girls? skirts are too short they are distracting the male teachers.? she continued.?
??Baduwa? and ?kaella??
?The message sent to our young men needs to change,? Bilimoria pointed out. ?So the message that we are giving in terms of the objectification of the woman is something that we need to change. ?Baduwa? and ?kaella? are two very common Sinhala words that young men use to refer to women. These two words are ubiquitously used and have been acceptable within every group I have met. This includes the clergy as well. I was at a children?s society where children as young as age 10 were using those words. That is what they are learning unless we take the boys and start talking about equal opportunity and equal possibility. We need to move into a place where we say that a girl and a boy are no different apart from what is between their legs. So it?s about potential, possibility, opportunity and that is what we need to focus on. During the recent Commonwealth Games we saw those children who won medals. It was because they had the opportunity. She wasn?t running like a boy or a girl, but she was running like herself. That should be the focus of our education system. At the moment we fall far short of that discussion of that school system within our homes. In terms of how we continue to reinforce the stereotype, the toys we buy, the colours we ascribe to a girl and a boy all that nonsense has a knock-on effect on these children to the point that they are ultimately objectified,? said Bilimoria.?
Approach for sex education?
With conservative norms spreading like a cancer, it has been a challenge to at least propose the topic of sex inside a classroom. But Bilimoria believes sex education is improving. ?We need to talk about relationships, how we treat each other, we need to talk about respect, empathy and focus on self-esteem. Most of the victims and perpetrators we work with have an issue with self-esteem. Why should a man hit a woman if he has good self-esteem? Why is a man rubbing himself up against a girl in a bus if he has self-esteem? So low self-esteem has a real impact and that is why the health and physical education curriculum have slowly progressed and gotten better over the years that now there?s discussion on self-esteem, respect and empathy,? he added.
?
As such, Bilimoria and Sekaram believe that schools are crucial because there?s no better place that brings children and parents together. ?Therefore we always advocate bringing parents to the school and having these discussions in the classroom and why it?s important to reinforce these messages at home,? Bilimoria further said. ?So you have to bring teachers and parents as partners in terms of this education. I think the National Institute of Education is crucial here. From 2006-2013, homosexuality was listed as a form of child abuse, but it is no longer there and there has been progression. Even in terms of understanding HIV there has been progression. But we definitely need to see what?s in the curriculum or teacher guide because teachers sometimes refuse to follow what?s in the curriculum. So we need to shed light on the tools that would take away the embarrassment and the shame in talking about these in a very fact-based, scientific, sensible approach,? he said.?
?
In early October a 52-year-old man who was sexually abusing a school girl was arrested from Hettipola. This was after the school staff discovered a letter written by the victim which was dropped off at the school complaint box
Grassrooted Trust is working with 60 schools in Batticaloa and Bilimoria also pointed out that parents seem to be more interested in exam results. ?It is not a today or tomorrow story ? it is hard work which is long-term and generational. But the longer we wait and the longer we avoid it, the more difficult it will be to undo these things. I think we still have an opportunity right now to undo some of these things because they aren?t entrenched.? he added.?
Educational reform mandate?
?We strongly believe in an educational reform mandate,? Bilimoria stressed. ?This has to have six core values including respect, self-esteem, consent, empathy, trust and the value of being sensible. We have been saying that these are the six values that any responsible authority needs to focus on. If you focus on these six core values then you are teaching people that it is not alright to go and rub yourself up against someone on a bus. We don?t have discussions about consent either in Sinhala or English. But one needs to be conscious of it and the principle about consent is a big one. All these principles are not just about sex or gender; it?s about the dignity of human beings and how we interact with one another. Human dignity is our focus and how do we further that conversation regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, faith, creed, caste etc.? We need to focus on the right to be you and until we teach children to respect each other and their differences, we are not going anywhere,? he said.
Early child protection?
In early October a 52-year-old man who was sexually abusing a school girl was arrested from Hettipola. This was after the school staff discovered a letter written by the victim which was dropped off at the school complaint box. Following this incident, The Grassrooted Trust emphasised on the need for support systems for students within the school system. ?From what we understood, there was an issue of trust. Therefore early child protection mechanisms are vital. The fact that she had no one to speak to, the fact that she had to write it down and put it in a box means there were trust issues. But we don?t know whether she went and told her parents and what their reactions were. Therefore you need to build systems and as far as I understand the Government is now training counselors to be appointed as counselors in schools. But I believe that a strong counselling system within the school, where the teachers are easily identified, is important, but it again boils down to confidentiality. Because many students have told us that they don?t want to talk about their issues because that adds to the staffroom gossip.? said Sekaram.?
??Therefore we need to ask what parents want from their children and what do we want these educational institutes to do for our children? We need to identify the skills and tools and what we need to do for our children to bring about this better world we harangued on about,? she opined.?
Bilimoria also pointed out that it?s important to de-stigmatise access to help. ?As we know mental health has much stigma associated with it and even going to the counselor will label that child or a person as mentally retarded. Therefore, talking to the school counselor as a natural part of growing up and dealing with issues is very important.? said Bilimoria.?
?
Accepting individuals?
Sri Lanka also has a community of diverse sexual orientations and gender identity. When asked whether there is space for acceptance Bilimoria referred to an incident that took place in 2011. ?There was an expos? done about homosexual individuals back in 2011. Once that article came out, many organisations closed down and ceased to exist. In fact everybody hid and none of the authorities came out. But they started to exist after 2015 since they thought they will have more space for discussion. When the constitutional process was happening there were two submissions by people of diverse sexual orientation and gender identity to include them in the Constitution in terms of discrimination. Hence there was hope for change and even the GSP + conversations were happening,?? he said.
?
It?s not rocket science that there are people with diverse sexual orientations. As opposed to the West they are often stigmatised and labelled in Asian cultures. The LGBTIQ community in Sri Lanka has voiced out their concerns on several occasions
In his concluding remarks, Bilimoria said that education reform is the need of the hour. ?Unless we don?t do that immediately, in 30 years this kind of an interview will be done again ? so in 30 years? time if this conversation continues then we have miserably failed,? he concluded.

He said this in response to a question raised by UNP MP S.M. Marikar.
?We have asked the CID to carry out an investigation on fake letters in order to determine as to who was behind them,? the Speaker said.
UNP MP Ravi Karunanayake then asked Speaker as whom he suspects might be behind the move.

Speaker should act in understanding with Prez: Wijayamuni Zoysa
	
Speaker?s stubbornness triggered turbulence in P?ment
	Executive, Legislature and Judiciary cannot function in contrast to each other
	PM is working to get majority in House
	It is good that SLFP factions are united
?
Fisheries, Aquatic Resources Development and Rural Economic Affairs Minister Wijith Wijayamuni Zoysa speaks about the change of government. He served in the same post under the previous UNP-led government representing Sri Lanka Freedom Party?s faction loyal to President Maithripala Sirisena. Excerpts of the interview:
QHow do you see the decision taken by the President to bring about change?
I always stand by the decisions of President Maithripala Sirisena. He takes well-calculated decisions. The President said he offered the premiership to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya first, and then to MP Sajith Premadasa. Since they refused to accept the offer, the President offered it to Mahinda Rajapaksa. He accepted the post. The President took the decision, be it correct or not. He is the head of the Sri? Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). I am a long-standing member of that party. I stood by the President. That is it.?
QNow the new government faces a crisis in mustering the majority in Parliament. How can you resolve it?
Minister Wasantha Senanayake, who defected from the new Cabinet, returned to it. Prime Minister Rajapaksa is acting to ensure the majority. I believe there will be no problem.?
QWhat do you think about the turbulence in Parliament recently?
I find fault in both sides. Primarily, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya should act in understanding with President Maithripala Sirisena. In my view, the executive, the legislature and the judiciary cannot function in contrast to each other. The three arms of governance should collaborate and follow a common path. Only then will there be stability in the country. I noticed these three arms taking different routes. It does not bode well for the country.?
The President delivered an announcement to the Speaker to be read out in the House. There is a procedure to be followed in the conduct of Parliamentary affairs. I have years of experience in Parliament as a member. The Speaker, at the beginning, reads out the announcements by the President. That is the practice. Yet, he did not do it on that day. The Speaker acted in a ?stubborn? manner and steamrolled his way in the presence of foreign envoys in the VIP gallery. It triggered turbulence in Parliament. It is not a healthy sign of any democracy. That is what I see.?
QThe UNP called this an unlawful government. But the government says it is legitimate. In that context, how feasible is it for you to discharge ministerial functions?
Relevant officials, in a situation like this, tend to be neutral without doing much work. But the ministers, if they are smart enough, can do some work even under present circumstances. I do my work. My officials cooperate with me. The others can also do the same. Nothing prohibits them from working. We do normal work.?
QPresident Sirisena forged ties with his predecessor Mahinda Rajapaksa shedding their political rivalries. Did you anticipate it?
It is the nature of politics. In fact, it is a characteristic of politics. Nobody can rule out such developments in politics.?
QIs this unity good for the country in your view?
There is nothing wrong with it. The SLFP factions have united. It is good in the greater interests of the party. This should translate into the betterment of the country as well. That is my wish. We should come out of the present impasse. There are four key persons here; the President, the Speaker, the Prime Minister and the former Prime Minister. They are duty-bound to address it. We are also responsible.?
QAfter the electoral defeat of Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2015, you compared it to a situation in which the father is dead in a family (Appachchi Malo). You said there was no use of lamenting over and over again if the father were dead. Now, you have to do politics again with Mr. Rajapaksa whom you referred to as a dead duck. What do you feel now?
I spoke to him. His son MP Namal Rajapaksa called on me. His brother Basil Rajapaksa contacted me over the phone. I met with the Prime Minister upon his request. I categorically told him that I could not be bought over by anyone in politics. I take decisions based on ideals only. I have a party. I have a leader. I act according to my conscience. If we crossover to another party, it should not be driven by inducements in terms of money or perks. If you are a politician with ideals, you should change your party in the national interests only. It is wrong to change politics for money and perks.?
During the time of former President Chandrika Kumaratunga, I experienced a similar political crisis. One MP from our district joined the other side. But I did not. We sat in the opposition. After a struggle, we won again.?
?
The President has every right to openly speak about what he feels is correct. He does not look at anything from his party?s point of view
	The three arms of governance should collaborate and follow a common? path. Only then will there be stability in the country. I noticed these? three arms taking different routes. It does not bode well for the? country
?
QRecently, with reference to your ?Appachchi Malo? story, you said Appachchi resurrected after being placed in a coffin made of Rukattana wood. It is a kind of wood used for anti-venom treatment in traditional medicine. What did you imply by that statement??
Take a look at the situation. We are mobbed by local and foreign journalists eager to know what is going on. Whenever they see us, they flash their mikes and bombard us with questions. It is sometimes done with disregard to our privileges as MPs.?
Once, a journalist asked whether I smuggled a sharp tool into the chamber of the House. I asked him not to raise such idiotic questions (Boru Prashna). I have been in politics for 30-40 years. In fact, we did active politics during the 1988/89 terror period.?
QI am asking about the Appachchi Malo story?
That is what I am saying. We have buried the past. If we talk for hours, the media only highlight a few rhetorical points that sell for them. So people wonder whether we provide jokes. Some of these sayings are not even found in the traditional usage of our language. Some proverbs and sayings are not even found in traditional folklore. I myself have coined them. I am intending to publish a book on them. Once it is launched, you can read them.?
QWhat is your experience in doing politics with the UNP?
I felt uncomfortable in certain instances. I boldly struggled on those occasions. I stood for the protection of local dairy farmers, dry-fish producers and the renovation of irrigation tanks. I struggled hard for it. I must tell you that our voice was heard.?
QDid you wish to continue with the UNP-led government or to form an SLFP-led government?
The President is someone taking intelligent moves. He is competent enough to take quick, intelligent decisions. He is a politician with a thorough understanding on cohabitation politics. We are his followers. We can work with anyone. If President Sirisena and Prime Minister Rajapaksa can work together, why can?t we??
QWill you contest the next general election under a common front with Mr. Rajapaksa?
Yes, I will! It will be a common front.?
QWhat are the reasons for President Maithripala Sirisena and former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to be at loggerheads in the past?
First of all, we must understand that there were two opposing parties governing the country. Our policies are different by and large. The President is the head of State. Whatever anyone may say, the President and the Prime Minister forge with the government. The President has every right to openly speak about what he feels is correct. He does not look at anything from his party?s point of view. If officials of his staff get involved in anything wrong, the President will not try to exonerate them. In that sense, he is an amazing character. Our country is not used to such personage. The President expresses?himself fearlessly.??

145 stranded pilot whales die in New Zealand
	
?
THE HINDU, 26th NOVEMBER, 2018- About 145 pilot whales died in New Zealand after being stranded during the weekend on Stewart Island in the extreme south of the country, officials said on Monday.
A hiker alerted authorities on Saturday night about the situation of the whales, who were stranded in Mason Bay in two separate groups about two kilometres apart, a Department of Conservation of New Zealand release said.
Half of the whales were dead when rescuers arrived and the condition of the rest, by the time they were found, was so bad it was decided to euthanise them, said Ren Leppens, operations manager at Rakiura.
?Sadly, the likelihood of being able to successfully re-float the remaining whales was extremely low. The remote location, lack of nearby personnel and the whales? deteriorating condition meant the most humane thing to do was to euthanise,? said Leppens.
Pilot whales, also called long-finned pilot whale, are a specimen with a bulging forehead and a robust body that can reach between six and seven meters in length, Xinhua news agency reported.

Unification of Europe-Africa through jazz music

There are many in our small island who are passionate about music. But only a handful make a living out of it. It is sad that most passionate and very talented young individuals end up in vocations that are completely inconsistent with their identity. These melophiles have so much to offer in the realm of music, but are wasted away in desk jobs that drain any musical colour within themselves. In Sri Lanka, there is hardly any scope for such bright sparks to utilise and grow their talent. But a route has been created by the University? of Adelaide, where talents of such persons can be explored while they concurrently follow a business degree. Professor Mark Carroll, Associate Dean, International and Engagement Elder Conservatorium of Music, Faculty of Arts, University of Adelaide, explored this topic further and gave peek into the type of lectures that would be delivered during the course of the degree.?
REALITY OF STUDYING MUSIC?
?Music is a complex and interconnected medium. For instance Western pop music has its roots from Africa rather than from the US. I was always interested in music. When I left school, I joined a rock and roll ensemble. My parents were quite flexible; they told me to do what made me happy. However, the idea of studying music does not normally sit well with parents,? said Professor Mark Carroll with a sigh. ?Their main focus is for their children to get a job post pursuing studies. Hence, now art subjects have become more flexible and innovative in order to complement our job-oriented world. We no longer focus on medieval studies where subjects are simply theoretical, but we provide well-rounded subjects that will train students to be global citizens. We also focus on global music thereby producing holistic musicians with a diverse range of capabilities.?
One of the greatest challenges faced by modern musicians is that their creations are freely available to be consumed via the internet. This issue is another reason why many consider studying music to be more of a pastime rather than a job.?
WHAT DO EMPLOYERS WANT TODAY??
?They want employees to have the ability to think critically and analytically, but they also expect vocational skills. They expect you to be a good global citizen who can think on your feet and respond positively to any situation,? he said.??
He elaborated on the mismatch between knowledge and understanding. ?There is a tension in study between knowledge and understanding. In our technology-driven world, information is at our fingertips. When I was a student, I had to go to the library or refer a book to gain knowledge. We are looking at a society that is saturated with knowledge. There is a dynamic, however, between knowing and understanding. They are not mutually-exclusive. We can know all the facts of a subject, but how to apply the subject is another skill altogether.??
However, liberal arts equip students with transferable skills of such knowledge. For instance, when a music student puts music on a stand to play, he applies his knowledge, uses interpersonal skills to engage with fellow musicians and often exhibits leadership in order to coordinate with his or her counterparts.?
?When studying music with business, you?re learning technical skills while being creative. This will make you unique in the workplace. The sciences and related disciplines explain how things work, while the arts explain why they work. It?s about striking a balance between both skills while focusing on humanity in the workplace too,? he said?
ELDER CONSERVATORIUM OF MUSIC, UNIVERSITY? OF ADELAIDE
The Elder Conservatorium is the oldest tertiary music school in Australia and widely respected as one of the country?s leading music institutions. It was established in 1883 and initially taught European classical music. However, post 1960s, the newer worldwide music trends found its way to the Elder Conservatorium. In 1970s, jazz music was included into the syllabus, in the 1990s, sonic arts and electronica were introduced and in 2012, pop music was incorporated. The university constantly updates its degrees therefore the qualification is cutting-edge rather than frozen in time.?

Music exists on two levels, as sound and as a form of communication. It is a medium that touches all five senses
A few of the new music programmes that were introduced by University? of Adelaide are as follows:?
BM (Bachelor of Music) - Sonic Arts?
?BM - Popular Music and Creative Music Technologies?
?BM - Composition?
WHAT IS MUSIC?
Music exists on two levels, as sound and as a form of communication. It is a medium that touches all five senses.?
Professor Carroll made us listen to Pierre Boulez structures. It was a rather obscure piece of music, where one could even say was not music at all. The professor gave us the context behind the piece and said Pierre, at the time, was a very angry young man who had lived through WWII. He tried to show, through his piece, that there was no beauty left in this world. He stomped on the notion of beauty and exhibited incoherent dullness in his piece. Hence, through music we could also understand the emotions of a composer.?
BEGINNINGS OF JAZZ?
He gave an introduction to the beginning of jazz, he said, ?1941 was a happy year for America when the first unhappy slave landed on their shores. The two musical cultures collided. European music at that time was structured and organised. Much like European society at the time. But at the same time, African tribal music was unpredictable and exciting and there was the use of call and response. African tribal horns became the brass we use in jazz today. The emphasis is on the sound; just as the note. This is because if we change the pitch we change the meaning. This is portrayed through the sounds that are produced. Jazz is a mix of Europeanized-African music and Africanized-European music. There was the coming together of two racial groups through music with the institution of slavery. Creoles and African-American music created a blend of styles. Creoles could read music and favoured European dance forms, while African-Americans began to play their previously vocally-infected music on European instruments, and used the same timbral devices as their African forebears, throat tones, vibrato, bending to obtain blue notes (a minor interval where a major would be expected, used especially in jazz.) Black music, as it did in Africa, used strong rhythmic pulses -- ?ground? beats, i.e. recurring rhythmic figures. Creole European rhythmic sensibility on the other hand tended to use melody in order to emphasise the metrical pulse of the music.?
So when black musicians tried to emulate the marches and other dances they heard played by their Creole cousins tended to ?rag? (elaborately syncopated rhythm in the melody and a steadily accented accompaniment, the melodies across the steady rhythmic pulse.) By far, the most famous of the rag-timers was Scott Joplin, who was born in Texasin 1868. In 1899, Joplin composed his ?original Rags? which were published and his famous ?Maple leaf Rag? which was turned down initially. Joplin was caught up in what was a worldwide ragtime boom, which lasted some twenty years and attracted the interest of composers such as Stravinsky and Debussy in ?Golliwog?s Cakewalk? (the cakewalk being the dance danced to ragtime music.)??

US border guards fire tear gas and rubber bullets at migrants
	
A migrant family, part of a caravan of thousands traveling from Central America en route to the United States, run away from tear gas in front of the border wall between the U.S and Mexico in Tijuana on Sunday (DM)
?
US Border Patrol shot tear gas and rubber bullets at a group of migrants, including toddlers, as members of the caravan tried to storm the border.?
?
Children were screaming and coughing in the mayhem at the San Ysidro Port of Entry when American agents tried to push the surging Central Americans back.??
They started to use crowd control on Sunday afternoon when migrants tried to cut a hole in the concertina wire gap on the Mexican side of the fence.??
The tensions prompted US officials to close the crossing between Tijuana and San Diego, stopping thousands of people travelling legitimately between the US and Mexico.? ?Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said she would not put up with this ?lawlessness? and threatened harsh punishments on anyone who ?anyone who destroys federal property, endangers our frontline operators, or violates our sovereignty?.? ?She later added that border personnel were ?struck by projectiles thrown by caravan members?
