Arjun Aloysius asked witness' help at PCoI proceedings
	
Perpetual Treasuries Ltd owner Arjun Aloysius had interfered with the witness who was supposed to testify at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry on behalf of Pan Asia Bank, it was revealed today .
It was revealed when Pan Asia Bank Deputy General Manager Aruna Benedict Dias' evidence was led by Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunathilaka.
Before calling for evidence, the witness was summoned to make a statement recorded by the police at the PCoI on July 4. Later based on that statement, Mr. Dias appeared before the Commission on July 5 to give evidence.
The witness said Mr. Aloysius had called him on his mobile phone on June 30, prior to him giving evidence at the PCoI and wanted to meet him for some reason. "Initially I refused but he kept asking me for at least 10 minutes?, witness said.
Subsequently, Mr. Dias had visited Arjun Aloysius? house based on his request. ?During the discussion we had in his house Mr. Aloysius told me that now we are in the last two crucial weeks of the proceedings of PCoI, so I need your support?? witness said.
The witness also revealed that Mr. Aloysius had guaranteed him a place in his company should he leave Pan Asia Bank because of this matter.
When the PCoI questioned his decision to go Mr. Aloysius? residence, the witness was of the view that it was concerning his personal and professional matter and therefore had the intention of obtaining more information from Mr. Aloysius.
The witness said despite rejecting such proposals, Mr. Aloysius continued to contact him making several phone calls prior to and after him giving statements to the police on July 4.
He said former Pan Asia Bank Chairman Nimal Perera had also contacted him after he made statements to the police and assured him a place in his future Money Brokering Company if something happens to his current position at Pan Asia Bank.
?I assume they wanted to prevent me from disclosing the truth at the PCoI," the witness said.
Subsequently, Commissioner, SC Justice Prasanna Jayawardena asked Additional Solicitor General Dappulada Livera to check for any legal provision which derives criminal aspects regarding such interference with the witness.
The Witness said that he first met Mr. Aloysius on June 2015 at the place of former Pan Asia Bank?s Chairman in the presence of PTL CEO Kasun Palisena.
That discussion was relating to the Pan Asia?s role as an intermediary between Employees Provident Fund (EPF) and PTL for the transactions in the secondary market.
According to the witness, the Pan Asia Bank had acted as an intermediary between EPF and PTL transactions in the secondary market during the latter part of 2015 based on the instructions of former Chairman of Pan Asia Bank, since EPF and PTL had certain counter part restrictions to deal between themselves according to some laws.
During the previous evidence led by DSG Gunathilaka, it was said that the PTL had dictated such intermediary bond transactions by deciding on Price, Quantity and Settlement dates to the Pan Asia Bank.
Additionally, the witness also said that he had another meeting with Mr. Aloysius in March 2016 in the presence of former Pan Asia Bank again.
?The PTL was having a financial funds issue in settling payments regarding the bonds that they had obtained at the auctions took place on March 29 and March 31, 2016, therefore the discussion was based on whether the Pan Asia Bank could facilitate PTL with ?intraday inject of cash?, said witness.
The witness was of the view that he was highly rejecting to provide such facility to PTL because it was a high risk to the Bank. ?Former Chairman of the Pan Asia Bank and Mr. Aloysius was attempting to convince me towards taking such decision but I was not happy?, said him.
Meanwhile responding to an argument that had taken place between the DSG and President?s Counsel who appeared for PTL, SC Justice Prasanna Jayawardena ascertained that the Commission has no friends or respect towards any individuals during the proceedings. The witness will continue testifying on Monday.  (Shehan Chamika Silva)

MOSUL AFP July6, 2017 - Iraqi forces on Thursday battled the last remaining Islamic State group fighters in Mosul?s Old City, where the UN said up to 20,000 civilians are trapped and in ?extreme danger?. ??
In neighbouring Syria, US-backed forces are facing fierce resistance from IS as they wage a parallel offensive to recapture the city of Raqa from the jihadists. ??
The fighting in both cities is taking place in densely populated residential neighbourhoods, posing a major threat to civilians as diehard jihadists put up a desperate last stand. ??
??Our estimate at this stage is that in the final pockets of (Mosul?s) Old City, there could be as many as 15,000 civilians, possibly even as high as 20,000,? UN humanitarian coordinator in Iraq Lise Grande told AFP. ??
??They?re in extreme danger from bombardment, from artillery crossfire...? she said.?

Dengue outbreak: GMOA calls for meeting with President
	
The Government Medical Officers? Association (GMOA) yesterday called for a meeting with President Maithripala Sirisena to discuss the Dengue outbreak in the country.
GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said they referred a letter containing several proposals for Dengue eradication to President Sirisena on Wednesday.
?As a trade union, the GMOA has appointed an Action Committee to control this epidemic. This committee has made several proposals on a scientific basis to the issue. According to these proposals, the prevailing conditions should be analysed in district and divisional levels. Public awareness programmes should be carried out and the laws implemented,? he said.
Dr. Aluthge said the contribution of the private sector was vital in controlling this situation, and that the current healthcare system in the country should be streamlined.
?We have requested for a date and time to discuss our proposals with the President. We are ready to give our fullest support to control this situation as we did when the country was affected with floods and landslides. During that disaster situation, we carried out some 800 healthcare camps islandwide,? he said.
Dr. Aluthge further stated that the deadly outbreak of Dengue had killed hundreds of innocent people in the country for the past five months, and that the death toll was increasing day-by-day. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Garbage Management: Schools disappointed with the approach
	
?
Garbage has been a huge issue for many months now, both on a domestic level and on school level. With many focusing on what?s on the streets, little attention is paid to what our little girls and boys are going through when it comes to the approach taken by schools to manage their garbage. ?
The Daily Mirror learnt from students from various leading Colombo schools that the garbage management within the schools is not going as smoothly as it is externally portrayed. Schools have informed their students to bring lunch boxes and to refrain from bringing plastic bags, lunch sheets, regifoam boxes, etc. Some schools have removed the garbage bins from each classroom, not providing the children with a place to throw their daily trash. In one such school students turned to the dustbins in the toilets, which resulted in the closure of all but one bathroom as a punishment. Students have expressed their dissatisfaction with the fact that the schools expect them to put their garbage in their school bags as they are not allowed to bring polythene bags to even collect their trash. Some students also stated that there was only one garbage bin allocated for each building, where you cannot throw paper or plastic. Students have also expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that the teachers do not have to follow the same rules of not bringing plastic. Parents too are very discontent with the way the schools are handling garbage management deeming it as ?too sudden? and that such practices should be brought in slowly and not in such a rapid manner. Instead of teaching student on how and why they should manage their garbage, schools are trying to solve the problem by getting rid of the garbage created by the students as a whole. ?
?
It was also revealed that certain schools have not adopted any form of managing their garbage with the students and continue to allow children to bring plastic. Some schools even take to burning their paper instead of sending it for recycling. ?
However, on a brighter note, we also learnt that many schools have adopted the three bin concept inside and outside the classrooms and food served in the canteen is served in paper bags, paper plates or put right into the student?s lunch boxes.? ?
Speaking to Tissa Hewavithana, Secretary of the State Ministry of Education, the Daily Mirror learnt that the Ministry had sent a circular last year towards the end of December, regarding on how to maintain school premises in order to prevent the spread of dengue. In the circular schools have been asked to reduce the use of plastic and to bring every child to have quality cooked food in lunch boxes. The circular has also asked schools to manage their garbage and become familiar with separating the garbage in bins. Regarding the fact that certain schools had removed the bins from the classrooms as a whole, Mr. Hewavithana advised that maybe they could have three bins in the classrooms to encourage and teach the children on how to separate their daily trash. ?
He further said, ?We need to give the children the necessary knowledge on the management of garbage, on the separation of degradable and non-degradable garbage and its importance which can be done by including this in the syllabus and our textbooks. We have to be a part of this sustainable project where in a short period of time we get the children used to creating less garbage and managing it. What we aim to do is incorporate good habits in our children when it comes to maintaining a healthy environment and managing their garbage.????

Judging a Number person by his traits
	
?
The qualities of basic Number 4 provide the clues to identify traits of the Number 4 person.
Number 4 qualities
Honesty, rationality, trustworthiness, patience, practicability, pragmatism, sudden violence, ignorance, square and earth are among the things that serve as symbolic representations of?Number 4.
According to Numerology, Number 4 also represents the decisive moment where one should be firm and resolute about the goals which one wishes to attain.?
?
Surprises both pleasant and unpleasant
The Sun which governs Number 1 rules Number 4 as well. ?Therefore, certain characteristics of Number 1 are found in Number 4 people as well. ?However, one characteristic specific to Number 4 people is the element of surprise. Many a thing comes to them as a surprise perhaps due to lack of anticipation. Many surprises both pleasant and unpleasant, therefore, are in store for them.?
?
Endowed with a sharp perception
Number 4 people are discerning and discriminating. ?They are endowed with a sharp perception. ?Therefore, they cannot be easily misled. They subject every common belief, every proposal and every bit of information to a critical evaluation. ?They would not blindly accept everything brought to their notice.?
Number 4 people are cool- headed and with a temperament as stable as the earth. But, once they are provoked, they would be as violent as an earthquake or an eruption of a volcano.?
Number 4 people are conservative in their outlook. They would follow the trodden path rather than blaze a new trail. They are honest and trustworthy. They are good organizers.
?
?
Unlucky combination
The association of Number 4 people with Number 8 people is considered unlucky for both. Their union would result in unfortunate circumstances. This means it would be in the interest of a Number 4 person to avoid marrying a Number 8 person and vice versa.?
Number 4 people are also advised not to live in premises or rooms marked 8, 17, 26, 35, 44, 53, 62, or any other number which could be reduced to the basic Number 8.?
?
Unlucky 13
Incidentally 4 is the basic number derived from 13 which is considered unlucky. ?This prejudice against Number 13 has gained such widespread acceptance or belief that it has led to the birth of the phrase ?unlucky 13? in the English language.
The belief that Number 13 is unlucky has grown so strong over the years, people from both the West and the Orient would not dare lodge in a hotel room numbered 13. ?Even hoteliers are now in the habit of marking rooms as 12, 12 A, 14 and so on skipping marking a room as 13.?
?
Lottery prize winners
Number 4 people practise thrift and invariably accumulate wealth. ?Number 4 is a lucky number that brings windfalls. ?Number 4 people often become lottery prize winners.?
?
Strong Sun bestows positive qualities
A Number 4 person born on a Sunday which happens to be the 4th, 13th, 22nd, or the 31st between August 17 and September 17 would possess all the positive qualities that number 4 represents. ?If the Sun is weak at the hour or the day of birth or in the Natal Chart, negative qualities such as ignorance and undue sternness would dominate the native?s temperament.

Mount of Luna or Moon
	
Human Hand - ?Trailblazer of Human Civilization -Part 16
?
By A.S. Fernando.
The Moon is the only satellite orbiting around the Earth. However, the Moon, in astrological nomenclature, is described as the ?planet? (Graha) closest to the Earth.
?
Wields the greatest influence?on man
Being the celestial body closest to the Earth, the Moon, of all planets ,wields the greatest influence on man and his environment.
?
Location
The pad formed on the left of the Life Line of the right palm and below the upper Mount of Mars along the percussion extending up to the bracelets at the wrist is called the Mount of Luna or Moon.
?
Sensitive and romantic
Persons with a developed Mount of Moon are delicate, sensitive and romantic. They are lovers of nature and beauty.
Those with an excessively developed Mount of Moon live in a dream world or a world of imagination. They are not practical-minded and find it difficult to face vicissitudes in life as they are not down to earth in their attitude towards the realities.
Those with a developed Mount of Moon are called Lunarians or Lunar subjects.
?
Hard-hearted and cruel when not prominent
Persons not having a prominent Mount of Moon are considered hard-hearted, cruel and materialistic. Those who are very bellicose and aggressive lack a developed Mount of Moon.
Lunarians are kind-hearted people who prefer to lead a peaceful life in harmony with others. They often happen to be artists, musicians and men of letters. They do not like to be subservient or submissive. They are very independent in thinking and action.
An excessively prominent Mount of Moon leaning outwards indicates that the owner is obsessed with ?the love of pleasures in life. He would be promiscuous and would go after beautiful women which would be the cause of his ruin.
?
Vertical and horizontal lines
Vertical lines on the Mount of Moon add to its strength while the horizontal lines indicate defects.
?
Travel abroad
A person would go abroad several times if there are zigzag lines on the Mount. If there is a circle on the Mount, the owner would go abroad for?political reasons.
A person with a conch shell sign on the Mount of Moon would achieve great success in life with his own effort.
The more the Mount is lined, the more the subject is restless.
?
Three divisions
The Mount of Moon can be divided into three parts as the Upper, the Middle and the Lower for the purpose of determining the health problems of the owner. Markings like dots, islands, cross-bars and similar signs on the upper part of the Mount show that the owner is subject to intestinal disorders. Markings like crosses, grilles, and ill-formed stars on the middle of the Mount signify gout or rheumatism. Meanwhile, kidney trouble is indicated by cross bars on the lower part of the Mount.
?
Defects and diseases
A Lunarian cannot stand hard work or prolonged exertion. He is in danger of drowning and of suffering from kidney, bladder and womb troubles.
Lunarians with pointed fingers live in such a world of imagination some of them get close to insanity.
Lunarians with conical fingers are gifted artists. Those with square fingers are lovers of poetry and those with spatulate fingertips are great lovers of beauty.

New SL bill on fishing irks Tamil Nadu
	
Tamil Nadu fishermen have stoutly opposed a Fisheries amendment bill reportedly tabled in Sri Lankan Parliament in Colombo on Thursday that unbearably hikes fines on foreign fishing vessels ?breaching? into Sri Lanka?s territorial sea waters, which could range from Rs 2 crore to Rs 20 crore per mechanised boat.
The ?Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (Amendment) Bill? if adopted by the Sri Lankan Parliament on Thursday, will particularly hit Tamil Nadu and Puducherry fishermen very badly, as they are frequently at the receiving end of the Sri Lankan Navy. Strongly condemning the new Bill, N. Devadoss, president of the Rameswaram Fishermen?s Association said that the Centre should immediately take up the issue with Lanka to ensure that TN fishermen?s livelihood is not destroyed.

## Title: So what have our intellectuals done?
## Section: News Features
## Date: 7 July 2017 12:18 am
So what have our intellectuals done?
	
I firmly believe that our intellectuals have taken us, the ordinary man, woman, and child on the street, away from reality. They tend to obfuscate, to dissipate the truth in a horde of profundities that read into something without getting anything out. The same can be said of every other field that has succumbed to these intellectuals: the law, science, philosophy, even religion. Without letting this prejudice my stance for or against them, let me come out with it: I don?t claim to know half of what the experts do. This isn?t a harangue against them, rather an attempt at finding out how our intellectual discourse has, and has not, helped us out as a country. ?
The primary function of any field, and the practitioners of such fields, is to help those who are compelled to resort to them. Sick people resort to doctors, those undone by injustice resort to lawyers, and those undone by grievous inequity resort to (what else?) the government. That is a fact, and because of it the authority claimed by these practitioners, given their credentials and experience, is taken for granted and assumed by default. Their main role, therefore, is to resolve an issue, any issue, as quickly and justly as possible. That is why delays are described as ?inordinate?. ?
The problem is that most of our professional bodies and professionals are either oblivious to this fact or choose to overlook it. Either way, it has led to these same bodies to be demarcated as arcane, archaic, out of touch with the realities of those they purport to help, and therefore unjust. The unlovely sobriquets earned by the legal fraternity, the medical community, and of course the government are not undeserved: they sum up the magnitude of the opposition against them by the people.? ?
It?s difficult to imagine how this state of affairs came about. One line of thinking goes that because of the elitism these bodies accumulated over the years, their practitioners were cut off from their own people. True, but that?s not the full picture: let?s not forget that some of the most significant and positive strides made in the last few decades, here and particularly in the legal sphere, were facilitated by the structures underpinning those fields. It took a long time for the United States to de-legitimise segregation and the ban on interracial marriage, for instance, but that was finally achieved through the law. No, the problem goes deeper: it?s the fact that those who lead these fields have managed to distance themselves from their surroundings. ?
To be sure, these intellectuals have not been behind all our problems. But I think there?s a fundamental problem when those who purport to speak (or do) something in the name of a collective (regardless of ethnic or religious affiliations) do so without considering the concerns of that collective. In that sense I believe our war was elongated thanks to the inability of many of our intellectuals to counter Eelamist propaganda. It took someone like Malinda Seneviratne (who has resisted the intellectual tag his opponents love to pin on themselves) to sum up the ?process of capitulation? we were subscribing to during those ceasefire years, while not even the brilliant Professor G. L. Peiris, with his impeccable academic credentials, could successfully counter the myths that the likes of Anton Balasingham were propagating. ?
?
"Delays in the delivery of justice, delays in the health sector, and delays even in the democratic process can, I believe, be rooted in two problems: one, the woeful gap between theory and practice in these fields, and two, the arcane structures underpinning them"
?
This dilemma, which isn?t really ?here? or ?ours?, has been supplemented by two issues. The first is the misconception that the policy elite of a country must be higher than the people, a misconception so dangerous that it has led to the materialisation of that society of royalists and paupers depicted by Michael Young in his The Rise of Meritocracy. The second, which is older and, by default, more persistent, is the way our intellectuals have overly intellectualised the social sciences. ?
?I have elaborated on the first of these in my previous columns. The second issue, therefore, interests me more, since it?s not too different to the arguments of that underestimated, vilified commentator Professor Nalin de Silva. To listen and watch de Silva is, of course, to force oneself to accommodate arguments that are virulently opposed to everything one studied at school and elsewhere. Given my abysmal understanding of science, I think it best that I don?t comment on what he has written on that subject. However, I am interested in how his arguments against Western epistemology can be extrapolated to our critique of the social sciences. When Professor Nalin disparaged (Western) science as pattapal boru, he was chided (rightly, we or rather those of my age thought at the time) as being too simplistic. He was shrugged off as a deshiya buddhimatha, who was too estranged from the world to merit a second opinion. What we failed to understand, however, is that he wasn?t really shrugging off science: rather, he was pointing out that its roots were relative to culture. He was more vitriolic with the social sciences and postmodernism, I remember: ?One does not need a degree or training in sociology to understand Weber?s Protestant Ethic or Foucault?s Sexuality,? he once contended. Rightly. ?
The truth is that Western social sciences were always removed from the same public they were supposed to aid. This not only explains the lack of a genuine, rooted human rights discourse in the East, it also explains why the clique marketed as our intelligentsia remain outsiders to our people. Delays in the delivery of justice, delays in the health sector, and delays even in the democratic process can, I believe, be rooted in two problems: one, the woeful gap between theory and practice in these fields, and two, the arcane structures underpinning them. ?
Montesquieu once contended that democracy was not fit for the East: we were too passionate, too prone to extremities of anger, love, and hate, to deserve it. Whether or not this was a bigoted observation is for another debate altogether, but I wonder: can this be a confession that there are no universal values, only values created or enforced? And can it be taken to mean that if the East wasn?t ready for democracy, any variant thereof that we absorbed was actually driven down our throats, against our will? I for one do not subscribe to the belief that the concept of individual rights is alien to our way of life (it?s not like we didn?t have democracy at all, let?s not forget), but I do believe that can help explain why Zeid al-Hussein, bemoaning Theresa May?s outbursts, asked the following regarding international human rights: ?Why is it so misunderstood, so reviled by some, feared by others, spurned, attacked?? ?
?
"Of course, the intellectuals have been calling the shots. Always. They have been leaders and representatives. They claim that those they represent accord well with what they say and spout. Irrelevant."
?
The answer to that isn?t that we (the East) are not ready for those rights, rather that they or the processes through which they are enforced have not been properly indigenised. ?The fact that Equal Ground and other LGBTQI rights activists need to knock on the heavily guarded gates of Colombo?s Western embassies to stand for the rights of Sri Lankan LGBTQI people is simply appalling,? Chaminda Weerawardhana (no lover of the homophobia and intensely irrational chauvinism rampant in this country) once wrote. Therein lies the rub: we are not opposed to what can, at one level, be considered as universal values, but we are opposed to the heavily skewed and biased ways in which they are enforced by social scientists, sociologists, and what not. The theory, as always, remains cut off from its practice: the intelligentsia can?t produce a Harvey Milk simply because they want to photocopy Harvey Milk. ?
I think we have to be a bit more circumspect when criticising the likes of Professor Nalin. He has been referred to as a chauvinist, a bigot, a man who?s against modernity and progress, forgetting that many of his beliefs can be verified. I am not entirely sure whether everything he has said and written needs to be accorded with, nor am I sure whether even his most vocal supporters (in print and elsewhere) share his opinions regarding Westernisation (because not unlike our LGBTQI movement, our nationalist movement is dependent on the same kind of Western liberalism he repudiates), but I do believe that inasmuch as the gap between the promotion and the dissemination of Western social sciences is concerned, he is spot on. ?
Of course, the intellectuals have been calling the shots. Always. They have been leaders and representatives. They claim that those they represent accord well with what they say and spout. Irrelevant. The truth is that until what they say is indigenised, and the processes underpinning their institutions are democratised, they will be cut off from their people. Call it a tragedy, call it a farce. In the end it doesn?t matter.?

Trump refuses to say he believes Russia was solely responsible for U.S. election interference
	
?
President Trump refused Thursday to say definitively that he believes Russia was responsible for interference in the 2016 election. ?
?I think it could very well have been Russia but I think it could well have been other countries, I won?t be specific,? Trump said at a news conference in Warsaw with Polish President Andrzej Duda. ?I think a lot of people interfere. I think it?s been happening for a long time.? ?The U.S. intelligence community has said publicly that it believes Russia was responsible for efforts to meddle in the election and that the operation was directed by Russian President Vladimir Putin. ??Nobody really knows,? Trump added. ?Nobody really knows for sure.? ?
Trump?s comments come just one day before he is expected to hold a bilateral meeting with Putin during a G-20 summit in Germany, and questions remain about whether he will confront Russia over the issue. ?
Trump cited intelligence reports about weapons of mass destruction in the lead-up to the Iraq War as evidence that the intelligence communities findings might not be accurate. ?
In his opening remarks, Trump warned that the U.S. and Europe were united in confronting Russia?s ?actions and destabilizing behavior.? ?

We will reveal the truth about SAITM: GMOA
	
The GMOA said today it had for the first time got the opportunity to reveal the true facts about SAITM in the Supreme Court, which had allowed the GMOA to intervene in the appeal filed by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).
GMOA Secretary Haritha Aluthge told a news conference that this decision could be considered as a victory for the forces campaigning for international standards on medical education and was a a defeat to the political forces which ganged up against it.
?We made several attempts to intervene in these court hearings on the SAITM issue, but they were in vain. On several occasions SAITM withdrew its cases no sooner we planned to intervene. We have got our chance at last,? he said.
Dr. Aluthge said the GMOA would make the best use of this opportunity to intervene when the appeal is taken up for hearing. He they were in sight of victory in the battle against SAITM.
Dr. Aluthge said the lawyers who represented the Attorney General and the government were still holding the same stance on this matter as held earlier and it was quite disappointing; ?We wrote to President Maithripala Sirisena on Thursday about this situation,? he added.
