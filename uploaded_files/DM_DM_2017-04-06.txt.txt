The Joint Opposition said yesterday the Bill to give legal effect to the International Convention to Protect All Persons from Enforced Disappearances was a dangerous piece of legislation with provisions enabling a foreign government or an institution on behalf of it to appeal for the extradition of a Sri Lankan political leader or military leader on the ground of command responsibility.
Addressing a press briefing, former External Affairs Minister Prof. G. L. Peiris said the Bill had been presented to Parliament on March 7 by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
This is not for something they have done, but for something happened within their scope of responsibility. Sri Lanka will have to oblige by all the provisions enforced by the International Convention if this Bill is enacted. The Prime Minister keeps saying Sri Lanka is not a signatory to the Rome Treaty and that a Sri Lankan could not be tried before International Criminal Court. What happens if the country seeking extradition has signed the Rome Treaty Then, there is the damage of military or political leader extradited being ended up as a defendant before the ICC, he said.
He said, There is a provision to set up a special High Court in Colombo to try offences in this category. No bail can be granted. The Police will be given the authority to investigate in the absence of investigations. He said his side would strong public opinion against the bill. (Kelum Bandara)

The main objective of holding the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) May Day rally at the Getambe Mahanama grounds in Kandy is to convince party leader Maithripala Sirisena that he is the president of the country, the party today.
Addressing the weekly news briefing at the SLFP Headquarters, SLFP spokesperson and Minister Dilan Perera said President Maithripala Sirisena was a person who turned right after putting signals to the left.
President Sirisena, who followed leftist politics, embraced politics of the right. Its not difficult for him to turn to left again, he said.
He said President Sirisenas speeches in Parliament were based on the advice given by people around him.
The President appears to have forgotten that he is the president of the country. Both former presidents Mahinda Rajapaksa and Chandrika Kumaratunga speak as if they are still the Presidents whereas Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe speaks like the Opposition Leader, Minister Dilan Perera said
He said the reality was that, all of them had forgotten their present situation.
Because he has forgotten the powers of the president-ship, President Sirisena is not utilizing his powers. Therefore, we have planned to remind President Sirisena of his present position as the President by holding a May Day Rally, he said.
The May Day rally would also be used to make the President remember that he was elected by the votes of people living in all parts of the country, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

31 minutes for 4 speakers unfair: JO
	
The Joint Opposition said today it would move the adjournment debate on the UNHRC resolution on another day after the debate scheduled for today was not held due to the adjournment of the House.
JO MP Dinesh Gunawardane alleged that four speakers of the joint opposition had been given only 31 minutes to speak during the debate which was not even sufficient to move the motion.
He told journalists that they had informed the Speaker in writing about the debate and obtained approval at the party leaders meeting as well.
"We asked the speaker to allocate more time to the JO. We had got only 31 minutes which was not sufficient even to move the motion. Earlier, the JVP and TNA had been given about an hour to move a motion," he said.
He said the leader of the house strongly objected against allocating more time to them.
He said JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake took 15 minutes to talk about an irrelevant point and arguments over the time allocation led to the adjournment of the House.
He said they expressed their strong protest against the adjournment of the House when an important matter was to be debated.
"We are the only ones to speak against the UNHRC resolution which is detrimental to the country. No one talks against it," he said.
JO MP Dullas Allahapperuma said it was clear that the government was not prepared for the debate because there were only two cabinet ministers in the House.
He said they requested at least 90 minutes to speak during the debate but they got only 31 minutes which was unreasonable. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

No draft on MoU with China: Ranil
	
There is no draft on the MoU with regard to Hambantota Port with China Merchant Company as the government has not got into an agreement with the Chinese company, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament yesterday.
He came out with this remark in response to a question raised by joint opposition MP Dallas Allahaperuma as to whether the government would present the draft agreement to the House last afternoon.
Further the Prime Minister said the government is looking for the possibility of increasing its stake of the Hambantota Port further from the intended 40 per cent that it has planned to earn after the agreement with the Chinese company completes ten years,
" Government will gain a stake of 40 per cent of the port after the agreement on the intended joint venture complete ten years but we are looking for the possibility of increasing our stake further," he said.
Responding to a supplementary question by Mr. Alahaperuma as to why the government has to followed internationally accepted norms in making assessments on the port, the Prime minister said it was the previous government which did not follow international norms. He said the then government agreed for a 48 month grace period and gave the ownership of the port and then also agreed to pay off the loans with high interests.
The Prime Minister added that this government is trying to go for a joint venture to pay back the loan taken by the previous government to construct the port.
Mr Allahaperuma then responded saying people have got confused about the project as the Minister of Port had said Cabinet had not given the nod for the project though the Cabinet spokesman, has said the Cabinet approval was given. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

The Minister told Daily Mirror that at least 15 tanks should remain with the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, and the rest could be considered for joint development with Lanka Indian Oil Company. He said the issue would be discussed with the Indian authorities.
However, a Cabinet paper has been submitted to transfer all the tanks for development under a joint venture with LIOC.
There are 84 tanks remaining unused at the moment. In 2003, the UNP government signed an agreement with India for the development of this Oil Tank Farm. Currently, LIOC is using 14 of the tanks in the lower farm. In the upper tank farm, there are 84 tanks still not used. (Kelum Bandara)

The government today said it is ready take up the aborted debate on the UNHRC resolution on another day.
This was mentioned by Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapaksshe at a joint press conference he held with Chief Government Whip Gayantha Karunatilake at the Parliamentary complex last afternoon.
We are ready to hold the debate on another day but the joint opposition has to resolve the issue on time allocations with the UPFA leadership, Mr Rajapaksa said.
He actually blamed the joint opposition for the disruption of yesterdays debate. It was the government which wanted to bring in the adjournment debate on the UNHRC resolution but we allowed the joint opposition to move it following its request. However the joint opposition sabotaged it yesterday wasting valuable time in Parliament by bringing in the usual complaint that it was not given its due status. Accordingly he charged that the joint opposition prevented the people from getting to know the truth on the UNHRC resolution.
He said it was the former government which signed an MoU with the former UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon which was followed by the appointment of Darusaman committee that accused that 40,000 civilians were killed during the final stages of the war. Mr Rajapakshe charged that the previous government later made a commitment to the UNHRC stating that it would take action on human rights violations and would go for devolution of power.
The Minister said UNHRC brought in a dangerous resolution against the government but the present government was able to dilute it to a great deal and scrap the call for an international probe on alleged human rights violations.(Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Ahead of the proposed strike by the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA), the Health Ministry said today such action could not be condoned at a time when the hospital authorities were grappling with the spread of H1N1 influenza in the country.
A Ministry spokesman said there was an influx of patients down with fever at state hospitals to be diagnosed if they were hit by Dengue or H1N1, and therefore the GMOA strike was bound to inconvenience people during the festive season.
The GMOA decided to launch this trade union action demanding the closure or nationalization of SAITM on the basis that its medical education was substandard.
Commeninting on this, the spokesman said the Health Ministry, Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) and other stakeholders had worked out minimum standards to be adopted for medical education in Sri Lanka.
The SLMC is due to take it up for consideration soon. Then, this is not the way for the GMOA to respond to the situation. The GMOA is being irresponsible in this case, he said.
He said people fear for H1N1 or Dengue when they experience symptom even with mild fever these days.
