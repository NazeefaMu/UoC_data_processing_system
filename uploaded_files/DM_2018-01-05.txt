Regular Exercise Can Help Reduce Asthma Symptoms
	

Asthma is a growing problem, both in Sri Lanka and in the rest of the world. According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, 235 million people suffer from asthma. This condition is the most common chronic disease among children. It is not merely a public health problem in high income countries, it occurs in all countries regardless of how developed they are. Over 80% of deaths caused by asthma occur in low and lower-middle income countries. Asthma is under-diagnosed and under-treated, placing a substantial burden on individuals and families and possibly restricting individuals activities for the rest of his or her life.

Definition
Asthma affects the airways that carry air in and out of the lungs. When someone with asthma is exposed to certain irritants, these airways become inflamed and narrower. This leads to coughing, shortness of breath, wheezing and tightness in the chest.
It is difficult to say for sure what causes asthma. You are more likely to develop it if your family has a history relating to asthma, eczema or allergies. It is likely that this, combined with certain environmental factors, are causes for someone developing asthma.

Causes
The fundamental causes of asthma are not completely understood. The strongest risk factors for developing asthma are a combination of genetic predisposition with environmental exposure to inhaled substances and particles that may provoke allergic reactions or irritate the airways, such as:

Indoor allergens (for example house dust mites in bedding, carpets and stuffed furniture, pollution and pet dander.)
	Outdoor allergens (such as pollens and moulids)
	Tobacco smoke
	Chemical irritants in the workplace
	Air pollution
Other triggers can include cold air, extreme emotional arousal such as anger or fear and physical exercise. Even certain medications can trigger asthma. These medications are aspirin and other non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, and beta-blockers (which are used to treat high blood pressure, heart conditions and migraine).
Urbanization has been associated with an increase in asthma. But the exact nature of this relationship is unclear.

Management
Although asthma cannot be cured, appropriate management can control the disease and enable people to enjoy quality life.
Short-term medications are used to relieve symptoms. People with persistent symptoms must take long-term medication daily to control the underlying inflammation and prevent symptoms and exacerbations.
Medication is not the only way to control asthma. It is also important to avoid asthma triggers - stimuli that irritate and inflame the airways. With medical support, each asthma patient must learn what triggers he or she should avoid.
Although asthma does not kill on the scale of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or other chronic diseases, failure to use appropriate medications or to adhere to treatment can lead to death.
How can physiotherapy help
A physio can help you learn to manage the physical effects of your asthma and something really vital; how to breathe correctly! Simple changes to the way you breathe will help you feel more relaxed, in control and will prevent your asthma symptoms from worsening.

A physio can help by showing you ways to:

Control your cough
	Get rid of mucus
	Use your inhaler correctly
	Cope better with asthma attacks
	Perform breathing exercises that you can then continue at home
	Work out an exercise plan for you
	Relax so that you can breathe easier

Breathing exercises and asthma
How we breathe affects our health and wellness. We must breathe well to feel well. You may think thats a no-brainer: you breathe without thinking about it, right Not always! Many of us breathe air in and out quickly through our mouths, using our chest and neck muscles. When this becomes a habit, we feel very unwell, dizzy, anxious and breathless. This is very common if you have asthma. Physios possess the skills to help you.
Exercises are a common trigger for asthma symptoms. Many people with asthma may experience difficulty in breathing and be plagued by coughing, wheezing, or chest tightness during or after exercise. However, most people with asthma can successfully participate in their exercise of choice with proper guidance and treatment. Exercise has been shown to be beneficial to all individuals, including those with asthma.

Exercising safely
People with asthma may be more sensitive to extremes in temperature, dry air, allergens, and pollution. When resting, breathing through the nose moistens, warms, and filters the air before it enters the lungs. When exercising most people breathe through their mouths, which may trigger asthma symptoms, so people exercising with asthma may feel better breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth. People with asthma should not overexert themselves, as this may trigger asthma symptoms. Consistent exercise is generally better tolerated, but patients with asthma should stop exercising when considering certain symptoms.

Best and worst exercises
Swimming is one of the best exercises for asthma because it builds up the muscles you use for breathing. It also exposes the lungs to lots of warm, moist air, which is less likely to trigger asthma symptoms. A comprehensive medical review of eight studies of children and adolescents from 2013 revealed that swimming increases lung function and cardiopulmonary fitness, without any serious side effects in patients with stable asthma.The ideal sport for asthmatics is swimming because youre breathing in air that is highly humidified and often warm, said Dr. Sujeewa Weerasinghe, National Organizer of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapist.
And staying in that horizontal position when swimming may actually loosen mucus accumulated at the bottom of your lungs.
But be careful of pools with excessive chlorine as the chemical can trigger an asthma attack. How do you know if its excessive If you can smell the chlorine, then its too much he added.
Yoga is another effective exercise for asthma. A 2012 study published in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine found that yoga training over 10 weeks significantly improved quality of life scores for women with mild to moderate asthma.
Other potential physical activities for people with asthma include,
Walking
	Biking
	Hiking
	Golf
	Gymnastics
No activity has to be off-limits with asthma, but some sports are more likely to trigger asthma symptoms. These include cold-weather sports, like cross-country skiing, and ice hockey and endurance sports, like soccer or long-distance running.

Regular Exercise
Doing exercises consistently can help reduce asthma symptoms by improving how well your lungs work. This way you have more stamina and get breathless less often. The other benefits of exercise are:
	Boosting your immune system so that your asthmas less likely to be triggered by coughs and colds.
	Supporting weight loss, which will reduce the risk of symptoms surfacing and prevent an asthma attack.
	Releasing feel-good chemicals in your brain to lift your mood. Studies show that if youre stressed or depressed youre at higher risk of developing asthma symptoms as a result. Staying happy and healthy is good for your asthma.

Tips for exercising
It might be helpful to consult a physician as well as a physiotherapist before starting an exercise routine. This is especially important with asthma symptoms that worsen with exercise. A Physician and Physiotherapist experienced in the management of asthma can help find the best exercises and asthma medications. Many people with asthma benefit from taking a short-acting bronchodilator about 15 minutes before starting exercise. In extremely cold or hot weather, or if there is a high level of pollution, it may be best to exercise indoors. This also applies to patients with both asthma and allergies when the pollen count is high.
Here are some tips for those with asthma who wish to exercise.
Warm up first.
	Try to breathe through the nose as much as possible.
	Wear a scarf or mask over the nose and mouth during cold weather.
	Avoid outdoor exercise when pollen counts are high and if allergies are present with asthma.
	Avoid exercising outdoors if air pollution is high.
	Do not exercise when sick.
	Include a warm-down routine after exercise.
	Do not over exert during exercise.
	Carry an albuterol inhaler as a health measure if needed.
Exercise is an important part of a healthy lifestyle, even for those with asthma. Aim to work out for about 30 minutes, four to five days a week. Obesity and a sedentary lifestyle may negatively impact asthma. Therefore, exercise is an important part of a healthy treatment for asthma.

Top tips
Review your symptoms and medicines with a healthcare professional at least once a year - more often if you have severe asthma.
Ensure you have an up-to-date asthma action plan in place.
Ensure you know what medicines to take, how much, how to take them and when to take them6.
Use your preventer inhaler regularly as prescribed. This will reduce your risk of having an asthma attack if you come into contact with a trigger. Be physically active as much as you can (e.g. walking, housework) and if possible exercise (e.g.an exercise programme). It is important to start slowly and only gradually increase activity as your body gets used to it.
Ensure you know who to contact if your symptoms are getting worse. Learn to breathe correctly so that you can be really active without getting wheezy.

Replica of Leyland bus goes viral on  social media
	
Social media was lately taken by storm with the newest invention of 25-year-old Randika Lakshan Abeydeera, a youth from Pathalangala in Embilipitiya, who designed a replica of a 54-seater Leyland bus -- 27cm in height and 110cm in length. 
The Leyland-lookalike grabbed the attention of beholders and the vehicle replica fandom as a whole.
The speciality of this masterpiece is that every part except the engine is manoeuvred using an intricate electric system.
The proud inventor, a past pupil of Presidents College in Embilipitiya, says the invention is an upgraded version of the replica he designed for an exhibition in Grade 8.
I used aluminium, iron plates, plywood, wood splinters and silicon to design the replica. I had always been keen on buses. My very first attempt to design a vehicle replica was in Grade 8. Although I made two buses, they werent powered with a lighting system. Many people did not believe in me because I was young. But, my friends always supported me. They still call me Bus Randika. I had the idea of developing a similar vehicle replica during my schooling career, but my education did not permit me to do so, he said. He said he managed to acquire the raw material for his invention by himself, which would otherwise cost at least Rs. 20,000. Finally, Randika expressed his heartfelt gratitude to everyone, especially Dinuka Nishad, for helping him in various ways to develop the
vehicle replica.

Rs. 3.8 mn dessert: Sanga says no one had to pay
	
Responding to his twitter followers criticisms made on Rs. 3. 8 million worth dessert, former star cricketer Kumar Sangakkara said yesterday it was just the launch of the dessert and no one had to pay the price on the day of the launch.
He tweeted and said Its the headlines that grab the attention. The details are lost to some
Twitterites confronted Sangakkara over the news that Rs. 3.8 million worth dessert which he shared with his wife at Grand Hotel in Nuwara Eliya on Wednesday.
The dessert named Marry Me, was created by Master Chef Viraj Jayaratne to mark 25 years of his culinary journey.
Tweets were made by several followers criticizing the exorbitant value of the dessert and Kumar, being a part of that event.
One tweet by Para read what a colossal waste of money and I cannot believe Sanga thought it was right to attend such an event considering that he has made a huge deal from his charity work in the past
He continued to say next time when you are invited to such a vanity project, and asked to eat a 3.8 million rupee slice of cake, tell them to feed 100 homeless kids for a week instead. That will be more impressive than anything you have ever achieved in the cricket field.
Another user Anuruddha Wimalasena asked How many good things could have been done using that 3.80 mn
In another tweet, Rajitha Vandebona Jr asked what was so special about that so called Rs.3.8 mn worth bite! What did you eat exactly Gold or Diamond
When asked by Sasa (AVSS) as to how he felt when eating that high- priced dessert, Kumar said the cake was very tasty and made with exceptional creativity. The ultimate value that makes it pricey is the blue sapphire offered on the cake to anyone who wants to buy the dessert, 
The rest of the Tweets came to defend Sanga. CA Praveen said it is not Sanga's idea or event, hence it would have gone on, even if Sanga said "no" to attending. Dessert valued at 3.8 mn doesn't mean that is how much they spend on it. It is the market price, he said.
Meanwhile, Pami said Some people tend to assume things on their own and start bashing without second thoughts. Take it light Sanga! (Lahiru Pothmulla)

It was just the launch of the dessert. No one had to pay the price on the day of the launch.

Running a slave camp
	

How a leading businessman, a sibling of a very high political authority, metes out summary punishment to his employees found or suspected to have neglected duty or done some wrong is a main subject of discussion in the public domain these days.

The businessman is the owner of a fleet of about 200 heavy vehicles and there are about 500 people in his staff, they say.
If an employee is caught cheating, stealing or neglecting the work assigned to him or if he is suspected of having committed any of these offenses, the businessman himself would beat him up after confining him to a room and would chase him away after the beating.
The employees, who suffer this summary punishment at the hands of the businessman, are never given a chance to offer any explanation, they say.

Russia urges U.S. not to interfere in Irans domestic affairs - TASS
	

MOSCOW REUTERS Jan 4-Russias Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov has urged the United States not to interfere in what Moscow calls Irans domestic affairs according to TASS news agency. 
Anti-government demonstrations erupted a week ago in Iran, and U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed support for the protesters. At least 21 people have died in the demonstrations, which began as protests against economic hardship. 
Irans army chief said on Thursday that police forces had quelled the unrest, but his troops were ready to intervene if needed. 
I am certain that our neighbour, our friendly state will manage to overcome current difficulties and come from the current period as a strengthened country and reliable partner to solve various problems, Ryabkov said, according to TASS. 
Those problems included compliance with the agreement Iran reached with world powers in 2015 to curtail its nuclear-power programme. Trump has long criticised that agreement. 
The current situation, when Washington gives in to the temptation to raise more questions on the nuclear agreement, Ryabkov said, is evidence that the United States is trying to undermine adherence to the deal. 
He added Moscow was sticking to the position that the deal is not to be corrected, playing down Washingtons stance on the agreement. 
In October, Trump declined to certify that Iran was complying with the nuclear deal. He must decide in mid-January if he wants to continue to waive energy sanctions
on Iran .

Safari jeeps entering Yala increased to 600 a day
	
Wildlife Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera said today the government had agreed to increase the number of safari jeeps entering the Yala National Park to 600 a day following a request made to President Maithripala Sirisena by several hotels and safari jeep owners in the area.
Meanwhile, the Fisheries Ministry said in a statement the government had reached this decision on a request made by Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera. It said earlier, the number of vehicles allowed to enter the park was limited to 500  250 in the morning and 250 in the evening and that this had resulted in many tourists being turned away.
The wildlife minister denied that tourists had be turned away because of restrictions on the number of vehicles entering the park being limited to 550.
He said increase in the number of vehicles would be valid for the next 45 days considering the peak time during tourist the season.
The maximum number of safari jeeps arriving at the park is around 450 to 550. Therefore there is no chance of any vehicle being turned away due to the restriction, he added.
Wildlife Conservation Departments Director General M.G.C. Sooriyabandara told Daily Mirror that this decision was taken considering the season and the request made by the authorities.
We have taken this decision as a step to support local and foreign visitors to the Yala National Park during their holidays. Measures have been taken to control and minimise the damage caused to the animals by the increased number of vehicles entering the park, he said.
However, Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS) President Rukshan Jayawardene told Daily Mirror that the authorities should have arrived at this decision on a proper basis and not in a haphazerd manner. (Chaturanga Pradeep Samarawickrama and Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Sampath Bank introduces Slip-less transactions

The bank plans to roll out bill payments, credit card payments, cheque deposit facilities and much more in the near future in order to reduce the use of paper and provide customers with more convenient ways to bank.
Also included in the expansion of the facility are special standalone terminals to be placed inside branches to help non-smartphone users take advantage of Slip-less transactions.
This is yet another first from Sampath Bank thus continuing our trend of starting the year with a digital innovation. At the start of 2017, we introduced 10 digital products and in 2018, we introduce Slip-less transactions. Our single-minded focus on our customers has allowed us to create greater convenience in their lives and provide them with a safe, fast and paperless transaction method.
This latest innovation takes us closer to our ultimate goal of paperless banking. We are excited with this launch of the Slip-less transaction facility and look forward to bringing more innovations, said Sampath Bank Managing Director Nanda Fernando.

Using the Slip-less transaction facility then onwards will be simple and convenient with the inclusion of a few details. For deposits, the customer will only need to insert the account number and the amount to be deposited in the Slip-less transaction app. Withdrawals can be carried out just as easily, by SampathVishwa users, by entering their account number and the amount they wish to withdraw.
Those customers who have already registered their account number within the app will not need to enter it again for each transaction. Even those who are not Sampath Bank account holders can use the facility to make deposits to Sampath Bank accounts. The app also has the added benefit of providing customers with access to their transaction history on their mobile phone.
Commenting on this innovative launch, Deputy General Manager Operations Dinusha Ihalananda said, Innovation has always been the cornerstone of our banking philosophy. We have always tried to change the way people bank and think about banking. And now with Slip-less transactions, we are once again changing the banking landscape.

The sole resident  of Dandenikumbura survives
	
Pics by Nadeeka Daya Bandara
Dandenikumbura in the Meemure Division in the district of Kandy could perhaps be the only village in Sri Lanka with a population of one man. Its a village deserted by the people for want of minimum facilities in a human habitat.
The members of more than 30 families had left the village about 15 years ago and settled in other areas as their last resort when their continual representations to successive Governments since independence, regarding their hardship, had failed. All houses vacated by them have been left to the mercy of
the jungle. 
The only man living in the village, an Aryurvedic physician, is Mahagedara Heenbanda (70). He pointed out that several houses had collapsed and others had been encroached by the jungle. 
The people did not have the basic facilities including an access road, a school, a hospital, or even a sub-post office. They had to make a long trek of more than five kilometers through hard terrain, wading across the river to reach the closest town of Meemure. They carried their produce on foot or used pack bulls. They had to wade through Heenganga on their way to the nearest village of Sulugune which was about eight kilometers away. They had to wade through Divigolleoya river to reach Meemure. More than 200 acres of terrace paddy fields that provided them livelihood is now covered with shrub jungle. None of the children had a school in the village to attend and they had to walk five kilometers to attend the closest school. When Divigolleoya and Heenganga overflowed during heavy rain the children remained at their homes for weeks. The people in more than 30 families deserted the village and settled in Meemure, Sulugune, Galamuduna, Hettipola and Godaulpotha villages. However, they obtain treatment from me. I inherited indigenous medicine from my father. My two sons are practicing Aryurveda in Meemure. I provide treatment free of charge. My sons visit me once a week.Heenbanda said. 
He said he would not leave the village and that his main duty is to serve alms to the Buddhist monk living in seclusion to practice mediation. 
The village is being encroached by the surrounding thick jungle. My parents lived in this village and I will live here until I breath my last. The buffaloes left by the villagers have turned wild and raid the village and destroy crops. It is a matter of serious concern that the authorities who boast of development ignore the condition of this historic village. A project to construct a road from Kiulwadiya to Batalawatta has been completed. This new road should run from Meemure through Dandenikumbura to Batalawatta to make it a human habitat again. Politicians come, when an election is around, stay for a couple of days planning development projects and leave. This is how they cheat the people.

Trump files cease and desist letter against Bannon
	

Attorneys for Donald Trump have issued a cease and desist letter to Steve Bannon threatening legal action after the presidents longtime consigliere was quoted trashing Donald Trump Jr. and claiming his father would have immediately been made aware of an infamous Trump Tower meeting with Russians.
The letter seen by ABC News comes on the heels of an extraordinary statement - part of which was apparently directly proclaimed by the president himself - bashing Bannon, the former top Trump advisor.
Bannon claimed a Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer, supposedly to obtain unflattering information about Hillary Clinton, was treasonous and unpatriotic, prompting an unprecedented brushback of the former White House aide from the president.
Trump attorney Charles Harder said in a statement: This law firm represents President Donald J. Trump and Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. 
On behalf of our clients, legal notice was issued today to Stephen K. Bannon, that his actions of communicating with author Michael Wolff regarding an upcoming book give rise to numerous legal claims including defamation by libel and slander, and breach of his written confidentiality and non-disparagement agreement with our clients. Legal action is imminent.

Two Russian servicemen killed in Syria mortar attack
	

MOSCOW AFP Jan4, 2018-Russias Defence Ministry on Thursday said two servicemen were killed in a mortar attack by Islamist militants in Syria on New Years Eve, but denied media reports seven military planes were destroyed. 
As darkness fell, the Hmeimim air base was subjected to sudden mortar shelling from a mobile group of militants. As a result of the shelling, two servicemen were killed, the Defence Ministry said in a statement to Russian agencies. 
The Kommersant business daily reported seven military planes had been practically destroyed in the attack, but the ministry said the report was fake. 
The news comes a day after the ministry announced a Russian helicopter crash in Syria that killed two pilots following a technical fault, also on December 31. 
With four fatalities this is one of the deadliest single days for the Russian army in Syria since it entered the conflict and brings the total number of officially reported losses to 44.

UNP, SLFP will govern country together till 2020
	

Tourism Promotion and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga, in an interview withDailymirror, speaks about the current political situation of the country. However, he declined to make any comment on President Maithripala Sirisenas statement on the Central Bank bond scam. He said the UNPs media unit only would respond to it. The excerpts of the interview: 
It is a walkover for UNP in Wattala area
I do not want to talk about other areas
Media misinterpreted what I said in Wattala on police
Those who criticize me in the party are men of yesterday
Governments priority is to bring about economic prosperity
Though some young MPs talk about a UNP government, one cannot do so
Drug menace is a serious problem in the country
QHow are you getting ready for the local government polls
It is a walkover for the United National Party (UNP). It is the Wattala Urban Council area and the Wattala Pradeshiya Sabha area. There are three parties contesting. The UNP can win without any problem. 
QYou speak with such confidence about your areas. What about other areas
That is yet to be seen. I am the organizer for Wattala. Others are also getting ready. I do not want to talk about the others. 
QAs a senior UNP politician, how are you going to convince voters this time in the face of economic issues confronting them
As soon as the government assumed office, we reduced the prices of gas, petrol and essential items. People have forgotten it. Prices of pharmaceuticals have been reduced drastically. The Health Ministry is now going to control the private hospital charges. That is very important. If you look at the school education, the very fact that an insurance scheme was introduced is a great boon. This is in addition to free textbooks and uniform materials. Now the insurance scheme has been introduced for schoolchildren. It is a great leap forward. 
As soon as the government assumed office, we reduced the prices of gas, petrol and essential items. People have forgotten it. Prices of pharmaceuticals have been reduced drastically.
The Health Ministry is now going to control the private hospital charges
QIn the Wattala area, you recently said that your voters had nothing to worry about in resorting to violence because the government had control over the police. Did you really mean what you said
Last time, we could have won both. But, that government of Mahinda Rajapaksa used thuggery. As a result, many of our supporters could not vote. The police were behind them. Though we tried to complain, it did not work. When our people asked whether the same would happen this time, I had to ask them not to worry. We said we were the government. The police function under the government. That was the message. But, your people in the media interpreted it in a different way. 
QActually the media reported what you exactly said. The media could not interpret. We watched the exact video clip. What have you got to say
You must see why I said so. People were living in fear at that time. They fear whether the same would arise this time. In that context, I said it. 
QWhen you said you had control over the police, and there was nothing to fear. Are you insinuating that you will strike back if anyone lays a violent hand on your peoplethis time
Now, the time is different. There is the National Police Commission. The police do not work at the dictates of politicians. I do not need to do it. I am winning this time. Why should I use thuggery and intimidation Last time, our victory was usurped. 
We formed this government. We worked so hard to get President Maithripala Sirisena elected to office. The UNP was the main contributor to his success. There is no necessity for a new structure of government. This government will serve its period smoothly
QYou were criticized by some Ministers of your party over your remarks. What do you say about them
Those are politicians of yesterday. They do not know what took place in the past. Take for example the infamous Wayamba election! There was a whole lot of thuggery used. We were chased out by Mahinda Rajapaksa and his group. At that time, he was a Minister. He was sent to all those areas.
QDespot political differences, you maintained a close rapport with Mr. Rajapaksa at that time. You, in fact, undertook some foreign tours with him. What do you feel now about it
I am a friend of all the Presidents who served in this country. When former President Chandrika Kumaratunga served in office, I knew her so well. We do not mix up politics with friendship. Mahinda was friendly with me. They invited me to join them. I said I could not do so. I went to Rome with Mr. Rajapaksa. I also went to the Holy Land with him. I always went with the permission of the Prime Minister.
QHow do you look to the future politics under the current circumstances
There is a question mark over the cost of living at the moment. Inclement weather conditions were the primary reason for it. If that is addressed during the course of this year, we will have no problem. 
QThe young MPs and Ministers of the UNP talk about forming a UNP government after the local government polls. What is your view on it
One cannot do it. We formed this government. We worked so hard to get President Maithripala Sirisena elected to office. The UNP was the main contributor to his success. There is no necessity for a new structure of government. This government will serve its period smoothly. After that, I do not know what steps will be taken by the government. The UNP and Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) will be together till 2020. Nobody can change it. We have to ensure prosperity for the country. That is by attracting Foreign Direct Investments and generating employment. Look at the Port City coming up! We are looking for more and more foreign employment for young people. Tourism is a thriving industry. 
QYet, these young MPs speak of something different
They imagine certain things. You cannot do it. We need an absolute majority in the House. The number one priority of the President is to reduce the poverty level. We have ensured religious freedom. We have ensured freedom for different communities. All the minority parties are very happy that their interests are being looked after. Earlier, Christian churches were attacked by anti-Christian groups. Now, they are safe. We have this serious problem of drug menace. Narcotics problem is everywhere in the country. It is affecting schools. 
QWhy is it difficult for the government to contain the menace
I do not know whether those doing custom -checking are under the payroll of drug lords. It is difficult to track them. It is a terrible menace. We find cannabis coming in a big way from Kerala, India. 
QDo you see any kind of political patronage for them
No. It is not from the government side at all. 
QAt one time, you were in charge of the police. What happened at
that time
I completely destroyed the drug menace. 
QDid you do anything during the 100-day period of the new government
At that time, we did not have much time to do anything. We were getting ready for the next election.

QHas it grown out of proportion now
Yes, it is out of proportion now. This is a crisis happening all over the world, anyway. 
QWSome people say relations between the President and the Prime Minister were strained after the appointment of the Commission to investigate the bond scam. What is your view
I do not see any rift in the relations. Both work cordially with each other. 
QWhat is your opinion on the appointment of the Commission
That is the prerogative of the President. He is going to appoint a commission to investigate SriLankan Airlines. 
QHow do you view the performance of the government during the last couple of years
The main constrain was the debt burden. The government revenue was exhausted to settle debts. The first priority was to settle these loans.

## Title: Zuckerberg says he's committed to fixing Facebook this year

Zuckerberg says he's committed to fixing Facebook this year
	
Mark Zuckerberg will focus on solving issues confronting the social network, including Russian interference, the spread of hate, and harassment and abuse.
"We needed to get serious."
That's the message from Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who kicked off 2018 with an open letter in which he pledged to fix the myriad of issues that have flared up in the past year.
The first step this year concerns his own attention, which will be more wide ranging than managing decisions and shaping the company's rules. That includes bringing "groups of experts together," he said in the post Thursday.
"These issues touch on questions of history, civics, political philosophy, media, government, and of course technology," he added.
The post caps a tumultuous 2017 for both Facebook and Zuckerberg personally. It began with Zuckerberg's dismissiveness about Facebook's role in spreading false information that helped Russia meddle in the 2016 election, and ended with representatives from Facebook, Google and Twitter telling lawmakers their respective services had in fact been twisted into tools of propaganda.
This isn't the first time Zuckerberg has promised to tackle this issue. In November, he lent his voice to new initiatives from the company to expand the reach of community service organizations across Facebook's more than 2 billion monthly active users. In September, he posted a video outlining his plans to thwart election meddling. And in August, he spoke out against hate groups on Facebook's service as they were being shut down.
"We may not be able to solve every problem, but we all have a responsibility to do what we can," he said in a post at the time. "I believe we can do something about the parts of our culture that teach a person to hate someone else."
Year of change
For nearly a decade, Zuckerberg has publicly resolved to take on a personal challenge to better himself or Facebook. In 2009, he said he'd wear a tie every day as a reminder that Facebook needed to get serious about figuring out its business model. The next year, he began learning Mandarin. In 2017, in the wake of a divisive election season, he chose to visit each state in the union.
"My hope for this challenge is to get out and talk to more people about how they're living, working and thinking about the future," he said at the time.
One thing that hasn't been on his lists is being more open. One of the chuckle-worthy ironies of Facebook is that its co-founder didn't publicly post much beyond what amount to press releases and professional photos.
That's begun to change as he's shared more of his feelings. Over the past year, he's spoken out more against President Donald Trump, leading some people to wonder whether he might be preparing his own run for president someday. (He's denied it.) And on Yom Kippur, the Jewish holiday of atonement, he asked forgiveness for the division Facebook has helped cause. "For the ways my work was used to divide people rather than bring us together, I ask forgiveness and I will work to do better," he wrote at the time.
He repeated the same themes in his post Thursday. "The world feels anxious and divided, and Facebook has a lot of work to do," he wrote.
CNET's Brian Bennett contributed to this report.

A medicinal guide to  control diabetes
	

An elevated level of blood glucose is called diabetes, caused by defects in insulin secretion or inability of absorbing insulin to the body. Diabetes is divided into two categories as Type 1 Diabetes and Type 2 Diabetes. In type 1, the body doesnt produce insulin and in type 2, the body doesnt make or use insulin well. Type 2 is considered more common. A blood test will determine whether someone has diabetes. 
Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas. Insulin helps the body to store and use sugar and fat received from the food you eat. When the pancreas doesnt produce or produce a little insulin or the body doesnt use or react properly to insulin, diabetes can occur. 

Insulin and oral hypoglycemic drug
Type two requires taking oral medicine to lower the blood glucose level. Sometimes, it is mandatory to prescribe insulin for patients who are being treated with oral medications, when the patient faces severe lack of insulin. 
Sometimes oral insulin takers are prescribed with the insulin injection if there is an infection, during an operation or during pregnancy. 
Whatever type of diabetes, the first step of controlling diabetes is controlling the diet. The importance of abandoning all kinds of sugar has been emphasized. Therefore, diabetic patients are encouraged to consume complex carbohydrates like unrefined rice, as well as limiting the fat consumption as much as possible. The daily calorie intake of a person depends on how much energy he is using within 24 hours. People with diabetes need to maintain a healthy lifestyle. 
Insulin and oral hypoglycemic are two drugs being used to treat diabetes and the doctor will prescribe the most suitable medicine to the patient. 
Treating diabetes will help control the blood sugar level of the patient and bring it closer to the limit of a healthy person. This will ease the symptoms of troublesome and frequent urge to urinate and excessive thirst and control weight loss. It has been confirmed that controlling blood sugar levels will phase out life-threatening diseases like kidney failure, blindness, heart attacks and strokes caused by diabetes. 

Dropping of blood sugar level 
Prescribing medication for diabetic patients with the aim of reducing the sugar level is known as hypoglycemia. During a huge drop in blood sugar level, a diabetic patient might face excessive hunger, sweating, lifelessness and feel faintish. If the patient is found to be conscious, he should be given glucose, tea or coffee with just a teaspoonful of sugar. If found to be unconscious or sleepy, the patient must be accompanied to the doctor immediately. The patient must follow medical instructions when having meals and have them on time and make sure he or she has the correct dose of medicine. These habits will help avoid further complications. 
Insulin treatment
Insulin is a protein which dissolves in the mouth and therefore it is given as a subcutaneous injection and is injected underneath the skin. The injection is labelled according to the consuming source, as human, bovine (cattle) and porcine(Pig). Quickly activating insulin is usually taken before a meal while taking insulin that takes a long time to activate is taken once or twice a day, usually in the morning and at night before meal. Both these types of insulin are given to diabetes patients to control the sugar level systematically. Oral hypoglycemics are also prescribed and the dose of insulin is given at night to control blood sugar. 
It is advisable to test the sugar level at home, by the diabetic patient self. It can be done using the glucometre, a simple equipment testing a droplet of blood on a glucose strip. Glucometers are available under various brand names, but the consumer must be careful to choose a metre with a glucose strip. 
Guidelines for patients.
1.Insulin should be taken before meals. 
2.patients are advised to take meals within 10 to 15 minutes of injecting insulin. 
3.If the blood sugar levels are beyond the usual, the insulin dose can be corrected according to that, but it has to be done only under the instructions of a doctor. 
4.The blood glucose level depends on the last insulin dose. Eg. The blood sugar level during daytime or at night depends on the insulin level consumed in the morning. 

Oral hypoglycemic agents
There are several groups of medicine. 
Biguanides like Metformin - these increase the glucose consumption in peripharal parts in the body. 
Sulphonylureas like Tolbutamide, glibenclamide, gliclazide, and glipizide.
Glitazones like pioglitazone and rosiglitazone 
Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors like acarbose 
There are a number of other medicines that are not so common - like sitagliptin.
Biguanide medicines like metformin are taken after and not exceeding 15 to 30 minutes, of a meal, while acarbose is taken with a meal. All the other medications are taken before meals. The other medicines except metformin are prescribed once or a twice daily in the morning or before dinner. Any medicine is started with a small dose. The doctor will change the dose of medicine according to lab reports. 
It is essential to <U+200D><U+200D><U+200D><U+200D><U+200D><U+200D>abide by a conventional instructions list, no matter what the system of treatments the patient is undertaking. A diabetes patient must have meals on time in order to remain healthy. The blood sugar level decreases by being late to have meals and then theres a given portion of food which cannot be exceeded by the patient. No patient can decide to have a light lunch and a heavy dinner, because overeating cannot be undone by using a powerful dose of medicine, except for the occasions when a patient has worked hard physically.

Arctic blast to grip Britain for a week
	

UK, (Daily Mail), 4 January 2018 -Britain is braced for further disruption after Storm Eleanor battered the country with gusts of up to 100 mph, plunging tens of thousands of homes into darkness and causing motoring mayhem.
A fresh warning of high wings has been issued for the majority of England and Wales today and the Met Office said some delays to land, air and sea transport are likely. The strongest winds will affect southwest England and Wales during the morning, moving east to reach eastern parts of England later in the afternoon, the Met Office said.
Gusts of 50-60 mph are likely fairly widely with some gusts reaching 65-75 mph along exposed coasts and over high ground in the west. The Met Office said it will be -10C (14F) in Scotland, gradually warming to -3C (27F) in the south of England on Saturday night. 
Met Office forecaster said: From Friday high pressure will build close to the UK

Are they really  campus rascals 
	
A couple of weeks ago at a religious forum, the keynote speaker who arrived late, instead of apologizing to the audience went on to comment on the behavior of Campus Rascals who staged a demonstration in the city that led to a severe traffic jam affecting his punctuality. 


CandleAid
I have been going through several applications over the past few days forwarded to CandleAid Lanka by University students in response to their annual programme in granting scholarships to the underprivileged. CandleAid receives sponsorships through various organizations and individuals living abroad and who have personal contact with its founder, Capt. Elmo Jayawardena, the former international Airline pilot whom I met at his Annasi and Kadalagotu literary fair. When I volunteered to do some social work for the organization he requested for help in translating some of the applications forwarded to them in Sinhala.

The applicants, undergrads from all corners, Deniyaya to Galewela, Ampare to Kalawana, Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa, North and East and many other distant places were seeking help to continue with their studies. I found among them students reading for degrees in almost all fields that included Medicine and Engineering, an exercise that gave me an opportunity to gain a comprehensive knowledge of the plight of some unbelievably distressing cases among the university student population and the lamentable plight of these unfortunate students whose families are unable to meet even part of the costs involved with their university education. Understanding the grave economic dilemma of poor families with brilliant children helped me to change my attitude towards the so called Campus Rascals. The meticulously planned mode of selection leaves not an iota of room for any unscrupulous elements to make advantage of the great service by CandleAid, the humanitarian organisation which operates as a non-religious non-ethnic approved charity. They run so many diversified projects to help people in need acting as a link between someones kindness and another persons area of need. 
S.W.R.D in Peradeniya
These two incidents refreshed my memory to recollect an incident reported in the readers columns in a news sheet a decade ago on incidents involving two Heads-of-State in 1950s at Peradeniya University. It was concerning Prime Minister, Sir John Kotalawala and his successor, S.W.R.D.Bandaranaike. It is worth recounting for the benefit of new generation.

Let me enlighten the readers with some useful back ground information before relating the stories, which had occurred on the campus in 1950s with Banadaranaike winning the Parliamentary elections in the wave of 1956. The undergraduates at both universities [Colombo and Peradeniyain fact the only two at the time] were dominated by Marxists and had no representation of the two big parties. They were divided into two camps, namely those affiliated to LSSP backed student union called Trots [Trotskyites] and those aligned to Communists Party coined as Commies. There were no UNP nor SLFP representatives within the Campuses; the former tagged a reactionary Capitalists party and a remnant of feudalism, and the latter a neo Capitalist/Chauvinist eccentricity of the UNP. It was simply out of fashion either to be labeled as a supporter the SLFP or the UNP. The leaders of leftists like Dr. N.M. Perera, Dr Colvin R de Silva and Lesley Goonewardene for the Trotskyites and Dr. S.A. Wickramasinghe, and Pieter Keuneman for the Communists visited Peradeniya to deliver speeches at selected Halls of Residence at the invitation of Student Unions. There was strong competition between the Trots and Commies at these lectures and during the question time as they attempted to give a hard time to the invited speakers of the rivals group. Whenever a politician of the other two main parties visited at the invitation of the management or a non-political society it was considered an insult to the rational haughtiness of the leftists who would see nothing else outside the Marxian ideology. Sir John Kotalawala, as prime minister had visited the campus for some inauguration and had been jeered and heckled. 
Trots, Commies and In-betweens
However, an invitation was received by the new Prime Minister, SWRD, to address the Students Council in 1957. As told by the contributor to the newspaper, the Trots and Commies were offended by the move. The Prime Minister of the country, in his typical Oxford accent and profound voice had begun his speech greeting the audience, 
Gentlemen. 
There was a loud chuckle from the students audience at the Arts Theatre. 
The PM had tolerantly remained till the noise died down, and corrected him by opening 
Ladies and Gentlemen. 
An undergrad from one corner of the hall yelled, What about others 
The entire hall let off a huge guffaw, a loud and boisterous burst of laughter this time, which even stretched longer. Bandaranaike looked rather bemused but the witty politician tolerantly waited for the haw-haw to die down. 
The Prime Minister began once again: 
Ladies, Gentlemen; and he paused for a moment, then he pointed his right arm index finger at the deep end of the hall where the voice originated and continued, and those in between!
There was stoic silence throughout till he ended his eloquent and persuasive speech. 
Today, it is fashionable to condemn the entirety of the university undergraduate population, citing the shameful behavior of a small groups of JVPers or their off-shoots and other politically instigated groups who not only regularly disrupt the functioning of these institutions, but has become a real menace to the other road users. The background of the Undergraduates then and now, and the conditions that led to their strange patterns of behaviour in the two periods five decades apart, are worth delving into. 
Todays campus students apart from an insignificant percentage, come from or Maha Vidyalayas or Central schools in the provinces and represent the poor and lower middle class parents of backward social strata. The parents are forced to mortgage the house to borrow for their childs education. There is no assurance of immediate jobs for them at the end of their academic carriers, the future being uncertain with no goals in life. These youth, though have the capacity and potential, but are denied of opportunities and this quite naturally changes their attitudes. They get attracted and turn towards groups that engage in agitations. 
The Peradeniya undergrads in the 1950s belonged to the urban upper-middle class or Colombo elite, and the majority of them read for degrees in an environment of western culture introduced by Sir Ivor Jennings, the first Vice Chancellor, which mostly suited their lifestyles. They were assured that on graduation, that they can forget their trot-commie ideologies and apply for lucrative jobs either in the public or corporate sector and seek brides with handsome dowries leading to luxurious life styles.

Campus kollo-kello
Allow me to relate another incident involving campus students which I had the privilege to experience a few years back in the ancient city of Polonnaruwa. Traveling from Colombo on our way to Somawathi Chaithiya on a family excursion, we checked into a holiday quarters, the two public officers with us had reserved for our nights stay. The fact that we were the only occupants that evening gave us some assurance of a well deserved peaceful night`s rest. However, our hopes were shattered when the caretaker announced that he was expecting a group of campus kollo-kello later in the evening. Based on our prejudices, expecting a chaotic scenario, we planned for an early retirement; wake-up before dusk and to take off at the earliest. 
The group, numbering around fifty to sixty arrived in two ordinary buses around seven in the evening and to our shock and amazement the males were busy unloading the provisions, while the girls got ready to cook their meal. After dinner, most of them got inside the rooms or halls, another studious few gathered at well lit spots for a session exchanging knowledge, while a few others were seen relaxing outside. There were absolutely no alcoholic spirits, baila dancing, partying or picnics. Next morning, by the time we were up around five, they were already busy again preparing their days meals. I witnessed their exemplary behaviour with an element of guilt, as we, on speculation, prior to their arrival, made some harsh comments, usually spoken about campus youth. By half past six, and long before us, they had their breakfast, packed their bags, cleaned up the place and got into the buses. 
Handapane Re Yaa Me
The previous evening, being inquisitive to exchange a few words with them and find out more about them, I walked towards the meda-midula area. The moon rose serenely in the Eastern sky bathing the place with its sylvan radiance as I approached one lone figure seated in a corner like all the stars in the sky condensed into a single point. After getting closer, as she ran her hand up his bare arms making soft and warm exchanges that realized it was two; an innocent charming couple, who were gazing at the rising moon in the eastern sky and deeply committed to their dream-world in that serene ambience. I changed my course and walked towards a group squatting on the floor, but refrained from disturbing them either, as I heard them singing in a low voice, the golden oldie of the 1950s, Handapane Re Yaa Me of Sunil Santha fame.

Oh! Why didnt they sing louder 
Yet, with the melody lingering behind and humming a wordless tune, I retired for the night, relaxed and contentedthe unforgettable experience of the three-day excursion.

Bangladesh parties brace for elections
	
THE HINDU, 04th JANUARY, 2018- Bangladesh has welcomed 2018 amid fears of political unrest ahead of a crucial general election. Anxiety over a possible return to political instability is growing as the country prepares to elect its 11th Parliament at the end of the year. Most political observers express the view that the 2018 elections are going to be fiercely contested as opponents of the ruling Awami League-led alliance are likely to use all their strengths to see to that the secular pro-liberation
parties dont return to power. The earlier election, in 2014, was held amid a violent boycott by Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its Islamist allies led by the Jamaat-e-Islami. One of the early indications of political instability is that the BNP-led alliance of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia has started pressing the same demand as earlier.

Candid reflections on our art house films This is the first of four articles delving into the proble
	
Have our movies lost the power to entertain, to impress Wherever I go and whoever I ask, the response is virtually the same: people dont go to watch our films anymore. People go to sleep through them. There was laughter throughout the hall, I remember, when I sat down with my friends to see Oba Nathuwa Oba Ekka two years ago. The ordinary man on the street who notices that he has time on his hands and that the nearest hall is screening a promising film, is too busy, too wearied, to contemplate on the intricate workings of such films, and instead bothers himself with those points at which, for him, they fail spectacularly. I remember one such man, who unfortunately was seated right next to me, chortling when Sarathsiri and Selvi made love to each other; this scene, shot from behind, was supposed to make us aware of how debased, how animalistic, even the most basic instincts become at the hands of an unfeeling miser, but my neighbour didnt care. He went on laughing and eating his popcorn.
In theatres and halls, every breath and blast of emotion, every nuance and gesture, is amplified and magnified to such an extent that what you hardly notice on the TV screen becomes too apparent and discernible for you to pass over. Golu Hadawatha, screened at National Film Corporations Tharangani Theatre more than two months ago (the first in a series organised by the Premasiri Khemadasa Foundation) had me grinning at sequences which I thought I had not (but which I had) seen on television. When Dhammi tells Sugath, Dont be shy to ask a girl to help you out when youre a boy, the schoolboys seated next to me, who doubtless would have reflected on their own romances and memories of young love, grinned openly. These were not sequences they would have opened up to on the small screen. And why Because movies have that power; they make you feel, they make you notice.
Untainted humour
So when directors try as hard as possible to not make you feel, to not make you notice, you instead concentrate on and laugh at those scenes and sequences and the underlying tensions in them from which the director consciously tried to bring out a specific meaning. The sequence of Selvi and Sarathsiri making love was supposed to evoke a different response; by that token, so was the sequence of these two kissing each other the morning after, by the window overlooking the Bogawanthalawa hills. But what did members of the audience respond to The fact that these two were kissing each other before washing themselves, before performing their ablutions. Its roughly the same response they gave when they saw, in another film (the name of which I will not mention), the lead female character professing her love to a man by telling him that he has the same odour and fragrance around him that he did the previous night. Sure ekata u anga hodala naha! shouted one of those ordinary members of the audience. I couldnt help it; the unintended humour was too much, so I grinned and laughed.
Anoja Weerasinghe argued, decades ago, that despite a plethora of promising, serious directors our film industry cannot and will not be salvaged unless and until the base, the popular base that is, has matured. She was correct, I think; after all, India could afford a Satyajit Ray because of the Mehboob Khans and America could afford a Wes Anderson because of the Steven Spielbergs. And yet, our critics, and for that matter our painters and poets and purveyors of high culture, contend otherwise. For most of them, the cinema must remain cut off from its populist inclinations. Its this line of thinking that compelled so many journalists to describe Oba Nathuwa Oba Ekka as the greatest post-war film made here, which also made our Marxist critics (who seem to have forgotten that class relations are more important to their discourse than the ethnic relations they gloss over, a point I will get to next week) praise Prasanna Vithanage using every epithet from their dictionary. When popular audiences feel alienated this way, they do either of two things; shirk the serious cinema and patronise the popular cinema (Ranja, Wada Bari Tarzan, the comedies of Vijaya Nandasiri), and, more disturbingly, judge that serious cinema via the values they ascribe to the popular.

There is less carelessness, in editing or scripting or camerawork, in a movie like Suhada Koka or Sikuru Hathe than there is in more than half of those art house products that end up winning awards at film festivals. That welter of formality, in these movies or even an awkwardly made products like Maya (Ranjan Ramanayake as an androgynous hero) or Sinhaya (Ranjan Ramanayake as a guardian of an orphanage) or Doctor Nawariyan (Ranjan Ramanayake as a purveyor of what hes referred to in an interview as the medical mafia), redeems their
lack of intelligence, their acts of condescension towards the audience, which happen to be their biggest limitation. In redeeming that failure, then, they eventually become self-referential: Vijaya Nandasiri is Vijaya Nandasiri and Ranjan Ramanayake is Ranjan Ramanayake, so what they do, the mishaps they cause, and the injustices they correct, follow a particular pattern.
Visual festival
Popular films also tend to become more visual as the stories progress, while serious films lose that visual flair towards the end.
The former open you up, the latter constrict you, which isnt saying much for the intentions of their directors. Age Asa Aga, to give just one example, compels you to remain in the Professors house: the entire drama revolves around the bedroom and the kitchen, and occasionally the bathroom, before the family visits a temple in a sequence which was supposed to depict the tension between the private and the public, but which, in reality, deteriorated to a series of hysterics that undid its own seriousness. This new trend  of suddenly opening you up to an overwhelming visual festival  is apparent in our other art house movies too, and for better or worse, they abort, rather than add to, the responses the director tried to glean from us with everything that preceded them. Unpredictability in the movies can be wonderful, as opposed to the boredom of linearity commercial films thrive on, but unpredictability can also subvert what it was supposed to bring about with respect to the intentions of the director, the auteur. Why did I laugh at half the scenes in Aksharaya, for instance, and why was I sincerely moved at Ini Avan and Thani Thatuwen Piyabanna and Channa Kinnari. Because there was no incongruity between intention and outcome even in the most unconventional, least linear plot-lines in the latter three.
A few directors face the opposite problem: their storylines are terrible but their visuals are redemptive. Many of Udayakantha Warnasuriyas and Priyantha Colambages films leave much to be desired, artistically, but their visual finesse, their regard for meticulous editing and what not, often make up for that. Both Bahuboothayo and Ran Kevita 2 are at several points crudely conceived, but the visual effects, the carefully scripted conversations, the twists in the plots, often compensate for what would otherwise be considered as sequences made in bad taste. The intentions of the directors here, I feel, are at odds with the outcomes in quite a different way; these directors want to entertain, to do away with any need for artistic fulfillment, but inadvertently, because of their eye for imagery (I dont think its a coincidence that both Warnasuriya and Colambage were and are involved in advertising), they trump their own lack of regard for aesthetic merit by their at times unconscious, meticulous, careful mise en scne. The problem of the art house director is manifestly different; he wants to intellectualise, but subverts his own objectives by providing the audience with reasons to laugh at and ridicule, rather than contemplate and be moved.
So when directors try as hard as possible to not make you feel, to not make you notice, you instead concentrate on and laugh at those scenes and sequences and the underlying tensions in them from which the director consciously tried to bring out a specific meaning
A few months ago, I contended in an article that the lack of discerning, cohesive critics should worry us in a context where theatres and film halls are rarely full, even during weekends, because when plays and films have ceased to be a part of common experiences (and instead become the occasional hobby or interest of that audience member who discovers that he has time to spare from an otherwise busy schedule), we need critics who can discern works of art for what they are without beating around the bush. Paraphrasing Pauline Kael, when movies, the only art that everyone can have an opinion about, lose their casualness, when they become an art or an object to ponder on by resorting to brochures which reproduce Derrida (rationalising the obscurities of the director), they lose their potential to be a part of those common experiences. To me, hence, as worrying as the lack of cohesive critics is, whats even more worrying is the gulf between the popular and the serious, a gulf that operates on the following principle: disregard the popular, the mainstream, and lavish attention on the serious.
The end result of following that principle is this; audiences will be alienated, they will continue to ignore the art house cinema, and even if they do patronise that art house film, they will find reasons in it, not to contemplate or reflect, but to laugh and grin.

Cheat with right political connections beats others!
	

This guy who resigned his post in the public service at a time he was facing serious charges of misconduct made a complaint soon afterwards to the high political authorities saying that he was politically victimized.

The shyster has now been reinstated in service with a double promotion, they say.
The informed ones say what is worse is that the authorities had reinstated the cheat with a promotion as a bonus in a mighty hurry when there were 129 others from the same service who had been really victimized for political reasons. Five of these victims are now dead while another 25 had gone on retirement with no compensation for the injustice they had to suffer, they say.

## Title: Childhood Fever Fits are not so dangerous
## Section: Medicine

Childhood Fever Fits are not so dangerous
	

Most parents are familiar with the term febrile seizures or fever fits, where young children suddenly develop seizures following fever. Due to the alarming presentation of the condition, these fits could be very distressing from the perspective of parents.

There are many controversies surrounding febrile fits, as well as the need to know by the parents in case their child develops this condition. The Health Capsule consulted Dr. Deepal Perera, Consultant Paediatrician at the Apeksha Hospital Maharagama, to obtain more details on the topic. During a febrile fit, an otherwise normal child- who has had a high temperature- suddenly starts convulsing. It may start with the child suddenly going tense and this condition will be followed by the arms and legs becoming twitchy. The child losses consciousness, usually for a very short duration; less than 5 minutes being common, with no lasting effects. 

Who will develop this condition
Almost all the children who get febrile fits are between 6 months to 6 years of age, states Dr. Perera. Children of parents, who have had febrile fits in childhood, have a high risk of developing this condition.

Seizures
Febrile fits are categorized into two groups, according to Dr. Perera. Simple febrile fits, where the fit is spread around the whole body, is called generalized seizures. This condition doesnt last for more than 15 minutes.
A child is said to have complex seizures if he has more than one fit within a short duration of time, or the fit lasts for more than fifteen minutes and if the convulsion is limited to one part of the body only, like an arm or a leg. More investigations need to be done with regard to treating of
complex seizures.

Challenges during treatment
The major challenge in managing these patients is the exclusion of meningitis as a diagnosis, according to the doctor. Infants and children with meningitis also usually present with fits following fever. With regard to these patients we will have to check for other signs present in meningitis, because unlike febrile fits, meningitis is a serious condition and demands urgent treatment, explains Dr. Perera. The children who have meningitis may also present with vomiting, headache, neck stiffness, confusion and in case of infants, bulging in the anterior part of the head, where the skull bones have not fused properly. In these cases, more investigations like lumbar puncture need to be done and a course of antibiotics must be
administered immediately.

How to manage this condition
If the condition is diagnosed as febrile fits, the wait and watch approach is preferred, rather than starting anti- convulsive drugs immediately. Paracetamol is prescribed according to the childs age and weight, and if the fever is high, tepid sponging is done with lukewarm water.
 
But why not start on other drugs. He explains that drugs should be used with extreme caution during childhood because the side effects of the medicine can be severe regarding small children. So before starting on a drug the risk to benefit ratio should always be assessed.  Febrile fits are very innocent in most cases and will disappear on its own. The drugs used for treatment, on the other hand, can produce side effects like hyperactivity and liver damage in children, hence they are rarely prescribed, unless during special circumstances, he explains.

Recurrence
According to the doctor, most children who develop febrile fits only get them once or twice in their lives. But there may be other children who may get it even 7/ 8 times. He assures parents that there is little cause for worry as long as the child doesnt get more than one fit per one attack of fever and they do not last past 6 years of age.

Long-term effects
Dr. Perera stresses that there is very little or no impact on the child in the future due to this condition. The chance of these seizures developing into epilepsy- that is recurrent seizure attacks in adulthood- are almost none, he reassures. He further added that these attacks will not be present once the child is past age six. These attacks will not affect a childs growth or the development of the brain in anyway, he concluded. So, with the majority of patients, the condition known as febrile attack is innocent, appearing only during a certain age group in children and vanishing on its own, leaving no after effects. But this doesnt mean that the parents do not have to be vigilant. If your child has had fever in the past, take extra caution during a fever and give him the prescribed dose of Paracetamol to get the temperature to lower.  There are some important points that the bystander should follow if a child is having a fit, because, how you act during the time may have a lasting effect on the childs health. The traditional belief that a stick or a spoon should be put into the mouth during a seizure is misplaced and should be discouraged. The child should not be fed anything during an attack since this might cause aspiration and might even cause brain damage.

The dos and donts
Turn the child into his or her left side to the position called the left lateral position, to minimize the chance of aspiration.  Refrain from putting anything into the childs mouth during an attack. Do not raise the childs head, as this again increases the risk of aspiration and may prove fatal to the child.
Time the seizure attack and if it lasts more than five minutes, take the child to the nearest hospital, disturbing his position as little as possible.

China to launch satellites for SL, other countries in 2018
	
China will launch over 35 satellites this year including satellites for Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Egypt as well as for commercial companies, GB times reported on Wednesday.
It said a number of satellites for ocean observation, weather, remote sensing and/or reconnaissance, earth observation and telecommunications satellite series will be launched.
Satellites for Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Sri Lanka and commercial companies GomSpace, Satellogic, Changguang (Jilin), SpaceTY, Kepler Communications, SuperView (Gaojing) and others would also be launched.
China could almost double its record for space launches in a year in 2018, with the main space programme contractor aiming for 35 launches and additional missions planned by emerging commercial actors.
The ambitious target reflects multiple expanding space programmes, a growing commercial space sector and a backlog from 2017, wrote Andrew Jones for GBtimes.
The China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), has announced at a conference on Tuesday that its 2018 work model includes 35 launches, underlining the return to flight of the heavy-lift Long March 5 rocket, the Chang'e-4 lunar far side mission and launches of Beidou Navigation Satellites as the major activities.
The Chang'e-4 Mission will be the first attempt to soft-land on the far side of the Moon, and involves first sending a relay orbiter to a Lagrange point beyond the Moon, set to launch in May or June 2018.
Expected launches for 2018 include more than 10 Beidou GNSS Satellites - China's answer to GPS of the US - including a number of dual satellite launches to medium Earth orbits.
In 2017, the US topped the launch tables with 29 (all successful), with Russia second on 20 (19 successful) and with China third (1 partial failure; 1 failure).

Commission clears PM: Minister Musthapha
	
While appealing to the media not to politicise the statement made by President Maithripala Sirisena on the Central Bank bond scam, Minister Faizer Musthapha yesterday said the Bond Commission had clearly said that there was no involvement whatsoever by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in the bond controversy.
He asked journalists at the SLFP weekly news briefing held at the party office whether a school principal would be removed when a student did something wrong simply because the principal admitted the boy to the school
Responding to a journalist at the news briefing, Minister Musthapha said the Commissionhas reported that Prime Ministers responsibility in the appointment of Arjuna Mahendren as the Governor to the Central Bank was proper.
Nothing has been mentioned on any lapse on the part of Mr. Wickremesinghe in the Bond Report and we all must accept it.
It is true that there has been a fraud involving the bond issue and the perpetrators have been found. The government will take legal action as mentioned by President Sirisena in his statement on Wednesday (3) and the illegally amassed lucre will be recovered. The statement made by President Sirisena is a unique statement made by a unique leader. The bond commission was appointed by President Sirisena not for a witch hunt aimed at any individual or a political party but to know the absolute truth behind the bond scam, he said.

Cruelty to journalists comes into focus
	
Enjoying impunity for crimes committed against journalists constitutes one of the main factors fuelling the cycle of violence against scribes, thus limiting them exercising their freedom to express and also weakens all other fundamental rights, UNESCO says. Statistics maintained by UNESCO reveal that worldwide, only 10% of the 930 cases of crimes committed against journalists have been resolved during the period 2006-2016. It is also of the view that combatting impunity for crimes against journalists is an important step in addressing the high levels of journalists killed, as it perpetuates the cycle of violence against them. 
It is a known fact that Sri Lanka was considered to be an unsafe country for journalists in the past. Several journalists were killed and printing presses and studios were burnt down allegedly for not toeing the Government line. 
During the conference to End Impunity of Crimes against Journalists, Sri Lanka Police Spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara informed the gathering regarding the current status of the investigations into harassment and killings of Sri Lankan journalists and attacks on media stations
The UNESCO Regional Conference to End Impunity of Crimes against Journalists was held in Colombo recently with the purpose of reinforcing regional cooperation to promote freedom of expression and the rule of law in Asia through ending impunity for crimes against journalists. 
The event was organised by UNESCO and the Ministry of Finance and Mass Media. 
During the conference to End Impunity of Crimes against Journalists, Sri Lanka Police Spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara informed the gathering regarding the current status of the investigations into harassment and killings of Sri Lankan journalists and attacks on media stations. 
Remarks of panelists
National level and regional level conferences and meetings to mark International Days are common in the world. Governments spend millions to host such events on a large scale with the presence of all heads of the Governments and other respective officials. At this UNESCO event, Sanjana Hattotuwa, Senior Researcher, Center for Policy Alternatives pointed out whether such events actually make any change in the society. 
Will such events make a change -Hattotuwa
Hattotuwa said, It is very nice that UNESCO conducts this kind of events in five star hotels where people can come nicely, have a good meal, talk in English and return to our respective countries and offices. But, the reality is that there is huge suspicion in my mind as to whether this kind of event causes any reversal or change in policy.
Independence of Commissions was very much in question in the past-Udagama 
Deepika Udagama, Chairperson, National Human Rights Commission Sri Lanka, speaking on the role of HRC in the impunity of crimes against journalists said, As far as the role played by Human Rights Commission in Sri Lanka is concerned, there are achievements and failures while impunity still continues. It is only where there are good checks and balances that democracy will function. Independent commissions like HRCSL, National Police Commission and etc. do have a major role to play by constantly monitoring the ground situation and working on the preventive side. When a violation occurs, the HRCSL does not have to wait till there is a complaint. Through motions, action can be taken by the commission. 
However, the allegation is that the independence of Commissions was very much in question in the past. An alarming factor that we see in Sri Lanka today is that the old habits of human beings and persons working in institutions die very slowly. 
We have to keep pushing the establishments in order to change this culture. What the commission does is investigate, inquiring into it and then make recommendations. Actually, our challenge is to coordinate matters with the criminal justice system. As far as the current legal situation is concerned, our findings arent sufficient enough for the Attorney Generals Department to take actions regarding the cases. 
However, what is encouraging is that National Human Rights Action Plan made a suggestion to amend the Human Rights Commission Act in order to officially recognize the commission so that it can refer the matters to the Attorney Generals Department. This allows the commencement of further action. 
What kind of assurance are we given about our safety- Premanath
Uthayan Editor Thevanayagam Premanath speaking on the present level of freedom of expression in the North said, My colleagues and I have never felt full freedom of expression in doing our job as journalists. There is intimidation going on. I think the situation in North is unlike in Colombo.
Pix by Pradeep Dilrukshana
In the North, we are isolated and such things are not being reported in the mainstream media in Colombo. Even after January 08, 2015 after the establishment of the current Government, we have been facing harassment and intimidation by state authorities, Navy, Intelligence Officers, Police and etc. 
Just couples of days ago, there was a birthday party in our office. Within half an hour, Police team came up and questioned what was happening in the office. It is obvious how the officials are closely watching over us. Following the brutal attack on our office in 2006, we had requested police protection through the IGP and they gave a permanent policeman to do duty in front of our office. But, in 2013 despite there being police protection, our main press was burnt down by the then Government. When we asked that policeman as to what he was doing until attackers burnt the entire press down, he said he was sleeping. What kind of assurance are we given about our safety We really dont know how to protect ourselves. 
Meanwhile, the moderator asked Minister of Law and Order Sagala Rathnayake for a reply for Premanaths claims. 
Govt. contemplating on setting up new legislation-Sagala
Law and Order Minister Sagala Rathnayake said that the Police will prioritize the cases related to freedom of expression. 
We started most of the cases despite many years having lapsed. Evidence of some cases had been destroyed. It was very difficult to recreate the evidence related to some cases. Even in some police stations, some evidence had been taken out. However, I must commend the Police, specially the CID for moving forward with the investigations despite the lack of technology. I would like to assure everybody that the Government is committed. We have even asked the police to prioritize the cases related to freedom of expression. 
When it comes to the attack on Keith Noyahr, he doesnt want to come forward and testify. The Government is contemplating on setting up a new legislation to be able to gather evidence despite that kind of obstacle. If that comes into effect, there will be a good progress in Keith Noyahrs case. 
With regard to Pradeep Ekneligodas case, there is a debate. The Attorney Generals Department says it is better to move forward with whatever evidence collected and file an indictment over Pradeeps abduction. The CID is of the view that they might be able to go for a murder charge. The CID has asked for more time and that is where that case currently stands. 
In Lasantha Wickramatunges case, we have come to a stage where we have to identify the users of six telephone numbers. We have identified the institutions where the telephones are used. But, there are a few technicalities which we need to sort out, said Minister Rathnayake.
Moderator Nalaka Gunawardene asked the minister whether there is anything preventing investigations into the attacks and cases that took place in the North. The Minister strongly denied the claim and said he was not sure about the cases said to have happened in the North. He added that if anybody could provide him with a detailed document regarding such incidents, he would refer it to the relevant authorities for investigations. 
We started most of the cases despite many years having lapsed. Evidence of some cases had been destroyed. It was very difficult to recreate the evidence related to some cases. Even in some police stations, some evidence had been taken out. However, I must commend the Police, specially the CID for moving forward
Then, Uthayan Editor said there have been thirty five incidents related to attacks, intimidation and harassment between 2005 and 2013 by military and unidentified groups. He meanwhile handed over a record of all the attacks Uthayan faced, to Minister Rathnayake hoping there would be investigations in the future. 
None of the cases have been investigated properly while some have never been investigated. I have never heard of any arrests being made in connection with these 35 cases. I am very curious about what ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said regarding the murder cases of Uthayan journalists Bastian George Sagayathas and Rajarathnam Ranjith. He said six arrests have been made. If there were arrests, a case must be proceeding in the court. But, I have never heard of such arrests. 
There was this culture of white vans and fear-Sonali
Sonali Samarasinghe Wickrematunge, Minister, Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka to the United Nations, New York, spoke about Polarization in the media.
There was a culture where authorities tried to show that the victims deserved death or any sort of harassment they faced. Nobody deserves such treatment. We were working during a time where there were no checks and balances. We did not feel any support from some sections of the society. There was a culture of impunity which was later turned into a martial art. 
We remember there was this culture of white vans and fear was really present in the country by that time. In the Sunday Leader, we had to face a pattern of intimidation. We were sealed. The media was taking sides by that time. It happens when there is a culture of impunity. It is disturbing to see the level of polarization prevailing in the media which was not seen when we were in the media.

Debate on the colour  of rice continues
	

 We Sri Lankans are a nation which barely spends a day without rice, the staple food in the country. According to the latest research studies rice has become the staple food for more than half of the worlds population. This is not a surprising fact when one thinks about the overall population of China, in which country about 78% of the calorie consumption is fulfilled by rice. 

Personal household life 
How concerned are you when choosing the best type of rice out of the numerous varieties available in markets These types of rice are cultivated and processed in our country itself or imported from other countries. This choice can be really hard to make especially when you are more conscious about the health of your loved ones and hyper-keen on choosing the most nutritious among them. 
Brown and white rice are the main two types we get to see in Sri Lanka at present out of which the brown rice is known to be the healthiest. This is because the outer cover of this rice is rich in Vitamin B and many other major nutrients which are essential to maintain a healthy body. On the other hand, some people believe that white rice is the best as that is the type which is consumed by the Japanese.
This nation produces the healthiest and the longest living people on planet earth. But the question is whether the mere color of rice be the decider when trying to figure out the nutrients contained within Has it been scientifically proven that brown rice is more nutritional than white rice This is actually a question which has been discussed at several expert panels around the world. Let us unfold some important information on this subject that we found out, through reading and analyzing. 

What distinguishes the two types
Brown rice is a part of whole grain rice (the first most grain we receive from harvesting). Brown rice is obtained by removing the outermost covering of the grain called the hull. The reason why this type is considered to be richer in nutrients is because none or only a small amount of nutrients are removed during the process of hulling or processing (removing the hull). 
On the other hand, white rice is prepared by further milling down brown rice, thus removing the layers known as the Bran and Germ- through which the majority of the nutrients are wasted. 

Brown rice contains 23.7% less sugar than that of milled white rice and is ideal for patients having Diabetes Mellitus. 
	Bran of the rice grain contains 8 different phenolic substances like Rotochatechuic acid, caffeic acid etc. which have anti-tumor effects and chemo-protective benefits. 

What is polishing
If the process of converting brown rice to white rice is further continued with to polish-in which the layer called Aleurone is destroyed- the grain of rice will appear whiter, glowing and palatable (pearl like), but with no nutritional value at all! This process is now preferred by most of the rice manufactures, owing to the fact that polished rice has an increased shelf life where the grains can be kept for 6-12 months. Even if the economic benefits related to this method of polishing can be immense, the consumers will not receive any health benefit as the grain is completely purified and rid of all nutrients. 
According to the latest USDA food nutrient data base, the mere process of milling brown rice to white rice can make 73% of Magnesium, 48% of Phosphorous, 45% of Manganese and 24% of Selenium go down the drain, which is a definite waste. Making the fact far worse, the complete polishing of grains can eliminate almost all the essential fatty acids and fibers, Vitamin B and two-thirds of Iron making our so-called staple food, Rice of no use. 

Fortified rice
In developed countries where these processes of hulling, milling and polishing are carried out, the Government has made it mandatory to fortify the grains with essentials like Iron before introducing it to the market. This is done in order to provide the consumers with the highest possible amounts of nutrients. Unfortunately in countries like ours, this is not happening, possibly due to financial restrictions and lack of awareness. 

Take home message
Having mentioned all these facts and figures, it is the sole responsibility of people to choose the best type of rice according to health benefits and personal preference. However, make sure to keep in mind about the faulty brown rice which comes in the form of dyed polished rice, dumped in the market just to make a quick buck.

Deutsche Bank faces new 740 mn-euro claim
	
REUTERS: Investors are suing Germanys biggest lender Deutsche Bank for 740 million euros, alleging they were underpaid for shares in subsidiary Postbank, local media reported Wednesday.
At the heart of the suit is the question of when Deutsche took control of Postbank from its previous owner, logistics firm Deutsche Post.
The investors argue that Deutsche Bank was already in de facto control of Postbank two years before it launched a full takeover of the bank. Deutsche Bank intervened significantly in Postbanks business and took over control as early as 2008, two years before it bought out the plaintiffs shares, their Munich-based lawyer Oliver Krauss told business weekly WirtschaftsWoche.
The shareholders say they should therefore have been paid the value of their stock as it stood in September 2008 -- around 64 euros per share -- when Deutsche controlled just 30 percent of Postbank, rather than the 25 euros they received in the full takeover two years later. Some 31 German and international investors are involved in the suit with claims totalling around 740 million euros.
According to court documents seen by WirtschaftsWoche, the plaintiffs accuse Deutsche Bank of striking numerous contracts and agreements, some of them secret with Postbanks former owner Deutsche Post in 2008. They allegedly included giving up risky financial market activities in favour of retailbanking, details of a capital increase at Postbank, personnel changes in the executive and supervisory boards, and the decision not to pay out a dividend in 2008.

Do you seek your fortune in a foreign land
	

It is our experience that one of the main reasons why people are keen on getting a reading of their horoscope is to ascertain whether they stand a chance of going abroad more for economic gains than for pleasure.

Main objectives
People generally seek to travel abroad for different reasons. However, it appears that there are two main reasons why people aspire to go overseas: either to secure a lucrative job in a developed country in the West or Far East or to take up residence in a foreign land where, they believe, life would be more comfortable and hassle-free.

Brain drain
In Sri Lanka, for years we have been lamenting a continuous `brain drain from the country. It is not only the brains  academics and professionals  that are seeking greener pastures abroad; there are hundreds of thousands of blue-collar workers as well engaged in a mad scramble to get to a foreign country where they could earn an adequate pay to keep the wolf from the door and to give their children a good education.

Prosperity in native place or somewhere away from it
Maha Rishis in ancient India who studied the influences of planets on man and propounded the principles that formed the foundation for the great edifice of Astrology may have either foreseen or gathered from sources accessible to them the aspiration of certain people to seek their fortune in a foreign land.
In fact, ancient Rishis had obviously discovered that while some people achieve great success in life in their place of birth, some others prosper when they move away from their native place.

Reference to foreign travel in ancient works
Many ancient works on Astrology like Saravali, Chamatkara Chintamani, Brihat Parasara Hora, Jataka Parijata and Uttarakalamrita carry commentaries on foreign travel.
According to Astrological principles which have received wide acceptance among the competent astrologers, it is the third House in a Natal Chart that rules short journeys. The long journeys are indicated by the 9th House. The 7th House too predicts foreign travel. However, it is the 12th and 4th Houses that can say whether there is a possibility to settle down in a foreign land.

Rahu, Significator for everything foreign
Rahu is the Significator for all things foreign. However, there are other planets too contributing influence towards foreign travel.

Short journeys
According to Parasara, Rahu in the 3rd House gives a lot of foreign travel or short journeys. But such journeys could end in a mishap or a disaster. The Moon and Jupiter in the 3rd House too cause short journeys and the latter confers happiness, fortune and prosperity during such journeys.
The Moon in angles in movable signs or common signs gives a lot of foreign travel inside the country and outside it.
The Moon in watery signs of Pisces or Cancer bestows foreign travel. The Moon in the 12th, 8th and 9th signify prosperity and residence abroad. The Moon in the 11th House points to love marriage and residence abroad.

Rahus role
Rahu in the 4th House causes the subject to leave his birth place and live in a far off place. If Rahu or Ketu joins the 7th, 8th, 9th and 12th lords foreign travel would occur.
Rahu in the 1st, 7th, or 12th House also means foreign travel.
Difficulties one may come across while travelling abroad are to be judged from the 8th House.

Long journeys
If Rahu is in the 8th House, native would die during the journey.
The 9th House rules long journeys by air, foreign travel, pilgrimages and voyages, according to Parasara.
If the lord of the Lagna is in the 7th House with a benefic, the native would live in a foreign country, says Satyacharya.
If the 4th House is afflicted, the native would be compelled to leave the native place and seek residence in a foreign land.

Dasas influencing foreign travel
During the Dasa of a strong lord of the 9th House, a native may:
(1) Go abroad and gain prosperity and high recognition there.
(2) Do higher studies with great success in a foreign land.
(3) Go on a pilgrimage or on a voyage.
The Dasas of planets occupying the 9th House or aspecting the 9th, the 9th lord and planets posited in the 12th play an important role in giving foreign travel or residence abroad.

En Garde against vision burglary
	

Your eyes are valuable assets. They are the windows to the outside world of scenery and colour. From conditions like myopia and hypermetropia to presbyopia and every other eye related ailment that comes in between, raising your concerns and awareness against them is quite necessary in the protection of your eyes. Conditions that threaten your eyesight are not to be taken lightly. When blindness is a consequence,
the malady is no joke at all! 
This weeks edition of the Health Capsule focuses on yet another common eye condition that is a challenge that has the potential to hinder healthy vision. Dr. M. Wijetunge, Retired Consultant Eye Surgeon of the Ragama Teaching Hospital speaks on Glaucoma. This condition is said to be the leading cause ofirreversible blindness. 
Glaucoma is a condition that affects the eyes. Dr. Wijetunge explained that glaucoma arises as a result of increased eye pressure (intraocular pressure) within the eye. If glaucoma is not treated on time, it could even lead to blindness as a result of damages to the optic nerve within the eye. 

Understanding this condition 
Dr. Wijetunge stated that glaucoma can be grouped into 2 types. They are acute glaucoma and chronic glaucoma. In acute glaucoma, the eye pressure rapidly increases suddenly. The field of vision will narrow as well as pupils will get dilated. A patient suffering from acute glaucoma will face symptoms such as eye pain and aches, weakening eye sight and vomiting, he explained. Though acute glaucoma attacks a patient instantly, symptoms are displayed which helps in early diagnosis and treatment that help in the cure of glaucoma. 
The eye surgeon stressed on chronic glaucoma as well. Unlike acute glaucoma, chronic glaucoma is contracted over a period of time. In this condition, the eye weakens gradually. The eye pressure increases with time causing damages to the optic nerve, accentuated Dr. Wijetunge. The eye surgeon explained that chronic glaucoma is divided into two main types. They are open angle glaucoma and close angle glaucoma. 
There are no specific symptoms displayed when it comes to chronic glaucoma, especially with open angle glaucoma. With regard to open angle glaucoma, the field of vision of a person decreases gradually. Vision develops to tunnel vision as the visual field gradually decreases. This would eventually lead to blindness, he affirmed. However he also stated that the patients long distance vision is not affected. Therefore an open angle glaucoma patient would be hard to detect. This is a cause for concern. When symptoms do not appear, it is hard to diagnose the condition early. This would delay treatment. By then a patient will have reached a stage of glaucoma where damages to the eye will be beyond repair, Dr. Wijetunge warned. 
Several factors are associated with glaucoma. Increased eye pressure, a whiteness formed on the optic disc and decreased visual field are these factors. In glaucoma, the corneal thickness of the eye may also decrease. 

Theres a reason for everything 
Focusing on the reasons that lead to glaucoma, it should be made clear that there are preventable causes as well as causes that cannot be prevented. Causes for glaucoma include conditions such as pigment dispersion syndrome, complications associated with the lens, displacement of eye lens, traumatic incidents to the eye, use of steroid eye drops, inflammations, eye nerve blockage as well as diseases such as diabetes, said the eye surgeon. 

Timely treatment 
He added that it is of vital importance that glaucoma patients are detected and treated early to avoid severe complications and consequences such as blindness. 
When a patient is diagnosed with suffering from acute glaucoma, the patient will be admitted to the hospital. Eye drops will be prescribed to the patient to reduce eye pressure. Saline is also given to the patient. Then an operation will be performed to reduce the intraocular pressure, he said. 
The eye surgeon further stated that under the circumstance a patient suffers from chronic glaucoma, the patient will be given eye drops to reduce the intraocular pressure. If eye drops do not prove to be effective, then medicine will be administered in the form of oral tablets. If that too is unsuccessful in bringing down the increased eye pressure, a surgery will be performed.
Glaucoma is a condition that can be cured through early diagnosis. If the diagnosis and treatment are late, further damages may be avoided before the condition worsens to the stage of blindness, but the damages that have already taken place in the eye cannot be rectified. 

High risk groups 
There are several groups of people exposed to the risk of contracting glaucoma. If you have a family history of glaucoma you may be at a high probability of contracting the disease. Patients suffering from myopia (shortsightedness) fall under the risk group. Diabetic patients can also fall victim to glaucoma. Last but not least glaucoma is generally common among people who are above the ages of forty, Dr. Wijetunge said. 
Congenital glaucoma is seen in infants and young children. Chronic glaucoma is commonly present in people who are above 40 years of age. Some symptoms that arise due to glaucoma is sometimes mistaken for presbyopia in patients who are in their mid and late thirties. 

Raising your guard 
As mentioned previously, there are preventable as well as unpreventable causes for this condition. While we may not have control over the unpreventable reasons, we can be mindful of taking measures with regard to the preventable causes. 
Preventing the use of steroid eye drops and protecting your eyes against traumatic incidents are a few ways, advised Dr. Wijetunge. You can also reduce the risk of developing glaucoma by taking preventive measures against diseases suchas diabetes.

Gothami Balika MV 95 batch get together on Jan 7
	
It was just an ordinary day in 1987 and about 100 little girls from various backgrounds and various locations, arrived at the road with their parents and loved ones with just one goal; to be educated. Gothami Balika MV was an extra ordinary place for ordinary girls, a Government girls school which is well-recognised for grooming young females. Temple road, temple flowers, four famous temples were things associated with this first Government Buddhist girls school. There was a prominent Buddhist culture at Gothami yet everyone recognised and respected other religions and cultures. They efforts of the teachers have contributed, in some way, toward the producing of doctors, engineers and lawyers, over the years. Members in this batch grew up together, but their destinies were decided in 1995. Some were very successful and realised their childhood dreams. But destiny took some of them on different paths. Becoming women who can lead the world was the priceless lesson they learned at Gothami. 
Today they come from all parts of the world for this get together which is titled Avarjana 95. 22 years later, on the 7th of January, they are united again, stepping into the holy turf of Gothami, walking down the same lane, smelling the familiar temple flowers as grown up women, despite each of them now having different careers. 
The goal at this event is to pay respect and tribute to their teachers and to honour and celebrate their lives. They will also not forget those teachers and friends who have departed
The goal at this event is to pay respect and tribute to their teachers and to honour and celebrate their lives. They will also not forget those teachers and friends who have departed. This is a rare, but unique opportunity for many reasons. The last 6 months were a testament to their strong planning, organising and execution skills. Old relationships were renewed, old friends reunited, high speed communication channels were established among all over the world and the organisers worked 24x7. They worked hand in hand with special bonds and everyone was determined to do a good job, even if things werent easy; sometimes impossible. 
As such the effort of these old Gothamians didnt stop there. They donated Rs 200,000 worth of educational items to their school including lecture/theatre chairs, new FM microphes and funds for a project that is aimed at improving the subject knowledge of students sitting for the O/L Exam this year. 
We did what we planned to achieve. Every single detail of this project was well planned and carefully executed. I am delighted and proud to organise such a remarkable event, stated Hansamala Ritigahapola, Senior Lecturer of University of Sri Jayawardhanapura Kotte who is the Chief Organiser of the event. 
I am very happy that my fellow batch mates are reuniting, coming from all parts of the world. They are going to give back something to their school and the teachers as good global citizens. They are all great women who serve the world in many different capacities, stated Shiromi Warnakula, a former school captain. 
Once again, they proved it, Pranna Lokasmin Pajjotho  Wisdom Enlightens the World.

How  to prevent slowing down at old age!
	
Recently I watched a video of actor Sir Sean Connery. Unlike the bygone days, he was slow and dependent on a care giver for mobility. Most of my rheumatology patients are slow. Some call them the Old and Frail. Age amounts to the number of years lived, but what is being frail Why do some elderly eighty-year-olds remain agile, youthful and strong And why do some slow down even at an early age as fifty Is there a miracle cure for us to remain youthful Are there any tests to determine how frail you are This article is aimed at identifying and correcting some of the reasons for typical old age behaviour.

What is being frail
Imagine an old gent struggling to mobilise himself. Getting up from a seated position itself is a challenge. If the seats do not have armrests the task becomes more difficult. And then, walking even for a few feet is a tough task. The swinging arm and leg movements are slow. Turning around takes a couple of seconds. All quick reflexes are absent. Sadly, if that person trips over an object, he is bound to suffer an injury. As to prevent a fall, rapid responses using arms and feet are needed. Strangely even patients without any sort of joint disease / joint pain become frail too.
Being a joint specialist/rheumatologist, I belong to a group of doctors who are usually the first to notice how frail a person is. This is because of some of the maneuvers we ask the patient to perform. In joint disease examination, I insist that the patient should get up from the seat, move towards and get on the examination bed. Careful observation of how he/she performs these tasks itself is sufficient for us to gather plenty of evidence. But mobility is just one out of many factors that we check in Frail index.
Frailty is now considered as a medical condition with multiple causes and contributors. This is characterized by diminished strength, endurance, and reduced physiologic function of the body. True to its definition frail patients suffer from lack of strength. Even if strength is adequate, endurance matters a lot in this age category. According to well proven research frailty increases the chances of an individual to become dependent on others. And unfortunately it shortens lifespan as well.

How frail are you
There are ways to measure how frail you are. A test that incorporates your cognitive skills, how rapidly you get up from a chair-walk-turn around- get back  sit down and a few other parameters is called Frail Index. Based on the score people can be categorized to mild, moderate or severe frailty. The higher the score, the worse the outcome is in terms of lifespan, risk of falls, risk of fractures and also other diseases like heart trouble, strokes etc.. Some tests check weakness as measured by low grip strength, slowness by slowed walking speed, low level of physical activity, low energy or self-reported exhaustion, and unintentional weight loss to determine frailty.
Even careful observation is sometimes enough to determine how frail a person is. But are there ways to at least partially correct this To understand all this, we need to know why people become frail.

Reasons
No exact reason has been discovered as the cause for being frail. Scientists think there could be a multitude of causes out of which genetics, lifestyle, diseases and the environment might play key roles in causing this slowness. Our own immune system which combats infections might cause what we call long term inflammation in certain organs. In the end, the muscles, skeleton, heart, vessels and the blood stream are affected and causes frailty.
Sarcopenia is lack of muscle. From the age of 20 till 90 more than fifty percent of muscle is lost/thinned out. This is the reason why the elderly, appear thin and wasted. We believe that sarcopenia is also a cause for being frail. 
Another reason is lack of sex hormones. These are oestrogen in females and testosterone in males. Rapid decline of sex hormones leads to an increase in frailty. Lack of Vitamin D also could contribute to frailty. Obesity in midlife is another reason for being frail, according to research.

Why are we concerned
Being frail has numerous disadvantages. Frail elderly are unfortunately considered by some as a burden to the relatives/caregivers. Full time attention is needed for some of these patients. They are at a risk of falling. A fall is by itself a disaster associated with the elderly resulting in fractures or head injuries and can lessen lifespan.
As you might be aware the geriatric population is rapidly expanding. There are many causes for this out of which better hi-tech health care is a key factor. Needless to say if the majority of these people are frail, more attention needs to be given in terms of finances and human resources.


How to mend the Old and Frail
As a consultant dealing with joint disease we encounter frail patients on a daily basis. A brief systemic review is necessary to figure out what could be amended with regard to these patients. For sarcopenia (lack of muscle) I prefer to prescribe some simple exercises mainly involving stretching. If there are features of Vitamin D deficiency, ordering supplements corrects muscle power and prevents bone pain. 
Joint inflammation (inflammatory arthritis like rheumatoid arthritis) is a cause for being frail. Treatment involves medication to reduce the swelling of joints. Evaluating underlying diseases like heart trouble, diabetes, anaemia, high cholesterol levels and lung disease is also extremely useful. For this simple tests are required and the problem can be corrected. 
What if the patient is already showing marked frailty Then we concentrate with preventing accidents like falls. I prefer to assess how the patient mobilises himself. Prescribing walking aids is the next best step. There are various different types of walking sticks, walking frames meant for separate leg/ body disorders.
We should never forget the eyesight, hearing and the sensing capabilities of these patients. Patients who are already frail have a huge disadvantage if their senses are diminished. Again a detailed history of problems will reveal most of these disabilities.
A popular query by youngsters is how to prevent frailty. The simplest remedy is to do regular non strenuous exercise and have well balanced nutrients. I urge the doctors to lead by example.
Sri Lanka is yet to produce consultants in geriatric medicine. This is a timely need as our elderly population is rapidly increasing. Although there are doctors who are interested in practicing geriatrics, we need consultants who specialize in this field. Geriatricians are exclusively trained in handing the frail. I hope our medical fraternity sets aside the different opinions to focus on creating and training as many geriatricians as possible.

UNP MP Ravi Karunanayake, against whom the Bond Commission presses bribery charges, said he was at a loss to understand how he turned up as a suspect since the Central Bank and the State Banks did not remain under his purview.
President Maithripala Sirisena, in his statement on the controversial bond transaction by the Central Bank, said the Commission had recommended legal action against Mr. Karunanayake under bribery charges.
Mr. Karunanayake said he would make an elaborate comment on the matter after the report of the Bond Commission was made available to him and others.

JO mulls no-faith motion against PM on bond issue
	
The joint opposition (JO) said today it was planning to submit a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in connection with the Central Bank (CB) bond sale issue.
JO MP Wimal Weerawansa said a decision would be taken at the JO party leaders meeting to be held on Sunday.
The government should not try to close the Bond chapter by sacrificing Ravi Karunanayake. It was Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who orchestrated this scam. There has been no greater scam than this which has made a severe impact on the peoples lives irrespective of their political views. Because of the bond scam, loan interests have gone up, he told a news briefing.
The MP said it was the Prime Minister who wanted to appoint Arjuna Mahendran as the Cebtral Bank governor and added that the value of rupee declined against the US dollar as an impact of this scam. The yahapalana government committed at least 60 robberies during its so-called 100-day programme, he claimed. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Lines indicating coveted gifts  of Mother Nature
	

The three horizontal lines on the wrist are called the Rascettes or Bracelets.
Bracelets of health, wealth and happiness
Some people have two or four bracelets. The ancient Greeks have called these lines Bracelets of Health, Wealth and Happiness.
Indian palmists call these lines bracelets of Health, Wealth and Honour and Respect. In other words, they differ in describing the third bracelet equating the Greeks line of happiness to honour and respect.

Most coveted gifts of Mother nature
Meanwhile, celebrated French palmist Desbarroles has described the third Bracelet as the Line of Fortune while sticking to the general nomenclature in respect of the first two Bracelets.
The renowned palmist Cheiro says that it is seldom that these three bracelets are found together on a hand because Mother Nature does not usually bestow the three most coveted `gifts, Health, Wealth and Happiness on one single person.

The Greek legend
Delving into an ancient Greek legend, Cheiro says that at a certain period of the Greek civilization every young maid was required to have her hands examined by the priest of the temple before being given in marriage. The purpose of this `ecclesiastical edict was to ascertain whether the maid seeking to embark on matrimony had the first bracelet nearest the palm representing Health well formed on the hands. For example, if the first bracelet was found rising up into the palm forming an arc, the Priest would not allow the woman to marry. Because such a malformation of the bracelet was considered as representing a physical deformity of hers preventing her from producing a child.
Cheiro agrees with this ancient Greek interpretation of the malformed first bracelet adding that this rule is applicable to both male and female.

Wish-fulfilling line
If a line starting from the wrist goes up, the owner would have his wishes fulfilled, says celebrated Indian Palmist Dr. Narayan Dutt Shrimali. Palmists both from the West and the Orient say that a clear and distinct bracelet closest to the palm adds strength to a distinct Life line.

Longevity  four bracelets indicate 100 years
However, some Indian Palmists directly link a persons longevity to bracelets. They say that if there are four bracelets on the hand, the subject would live up to 100 years. This interpretation is based on the reckoning that one bracelet represents 25 years of age. However, renowned palmist Psychos says that he has met subjects aged over 80, with only two bracelets.
Some of the characteristics of bracelets and their significations are as follows:
(1) The first bracelet chained: A life of much hard work and care, but final success with efforts coming to fruition.
(2) Three clear bracelets with a poorly marked line of Life: A beneficiary of a great fortune, but health is too poor to enjoy his fortune.
(3) The first bracelet high on the wrist and convex in shape: Defective reproductive system and difficulties in child bearing.
(4) A line proceeding from the Rascettes to the Mount of Jupiter: A long and successful journey.
(5) A line proceeding straight to the Mount of Mercury: Indication of sudden wealth.
(6) Lines running from the bracelets to the Mount of Moon: Every line indicates a journey. Longer the travel lines, longer the journeys.

LTTE financiers to stand trial in Switzerland
	
Thirteen financiers accused of funnelling more than CH15 million ($15.3 million) to the Sri Lankan Tamil separatist group Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam (LTTE) will stand trial before the Swiss Federal Criminal Court on Monday.
The accused are from Switzerland, Germany and Sri Lanka. Some are former members of the World Tamil Coordinating Committee (WTCC), which represented the LTTE in Switzerland until 2009, and include its founder, his deputy and the person in charge of finances.
Between 1999 and 2009, they allegedly created a complex fundraising structure which involved coaxing members of the Tamil diaspora to obtain loans from banks. To raise higher amounts, the WTCC was accused of creating fictitious companies in the name of borrowers that issued fake salary certificates.
The 13 on trial face charges of fraud, false documentation, money laundering and extortion. As the LTTE was never declared a terror organisation in Switzerland, they will not face charges of funding a terror group, unlike cases involving Islamic State or al-Qaeda.
The Attorney General strongly suspects the LTTE fraction under investigation of having collected the money in question by means of threats and by creating a regime of fear to induce them to make the payments, says a court documentexternal link.
The Swiss funds were transported in cash by couriers to Singapore and Dubai, eventually reaching the LTTE in Sri Lanka who allegedly used the money to purchase arms. This funding system collapsed in 2009 after the LTTEs military defeat at the hands of the Sri Lankan armed forces.
I dont think [the 13 suspects] should face trial as the LTTE struggled for the freedom and self-determination of Tamils, which is not a crime. It takes two parties to make a war and Switzerland should investigate the war crimes of the Sri Lankan army as well, Anna Annor, president of Swiss Council of Eelam Tamils, told swissinfo.ch on Thursday.
Long-drawn saga
The whole process was set in motion in 2009 when the Office of the Attorney General launched an investigation against unknown persons for extortion, coercion, money laundering and organised crime.
In 2011, a vast sting operation in several Swiss cantons resulted in the arrest of several suspects who were later released within a span of two months. A year later, a delegation from the Office of the Attorney General and the Federal Office of Police travelled to Sri Lanka to interview around 15 witnesses.
Around 80% of Tamils living in Switzerland had made payments to support LTTE at the time to support the struggle against genocide. That does not make Tamils supporters of terrorism, says Kuruparan Kurusamy, former president of the Swiss Council of Eelam Tamils.
The trial of the accused was originally scheduled for June 2016. However, proceedings were delayed when the lawyer of one of the accused demanded that a bank involved in the financial transactions also be cited by the judge as one of the defendants. According to Kurusamy, the bank in question was Credit Suisse and he claims it had accepted 135 loans under the name of one Sri Lankan national based in Germany.
However, the Federal Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, allowing the trial to go ahead. A verdict is expected around mid-March. 
Around 50,000 people from Sri Lanka live in Switzerland, mostly ethnic Tamils, who fled the islands 30-year civil war that ended in 2009. Many applied for Swiss citizenship and as of 2016 there were slightly more than 28,000 people with Sri Lankan citizenship residing in Switzerland. In 2016, the Swiss government announced it would apply more stringent criteria for granting Sri Lankan nationals refugee status. (swissinfo)

President clears PM's name in Bond scam: Namal
	
Joint Opposition MP Namal Rajapaksa yesterday said President Maithripala Sirisena had cleared the good name of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe through his Wednesdays statement on the Central Bank bond scam.
Addressing the media following an event held in Colombo, MP Rajapaksa said that accordingly, now the wrongdoer was former Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran.
In President Sirisenas statement, he has cleared the good name of Prime Minister Wickremesinghe. The wrongdoer is Mahendran, notthe person who had appointed him or the person who was going to appoint him, he added.
He said the President could not escape from his liability with regard to this issue and added that he should be answerable to it.
While referring to the Bond Commissions recommendation on Central Bank to conduct a forensic audit with regard to the alleged fraud and corrupt practices from 2008, he said it was mandatory to launch such an investigation since it would reveal the differenceand confirm the frauds occurred in 2015.
Investigating this issue from 2008 was the only way to prove that no fraud had taken place within that period, he added.
He requested President Sirisena to investigate the alleged fraud and irregularities from 2008, and added, that however, the current findings on bond issue should not be concealed. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
