Direct to indirect tax ratio of 20:80 to change to 60:40
	
The main objective of the proposed Inland Revenue Bill (IRB) is to introduce a 60:40 direct to indirect tax ratio from the current direct to indirect tax ratio of 20:80 within the next three years with an across-the-board tax regime for taxable income including those at religious places of worship, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said yesterday.
He rejected the joint opposition charge that the IRB was targeting the poor and pointed out that this Bill would help rope in the large number of professionals such as doctors, engineers, surveyors, private tuition masters and architects who evade tax on the millions they earn monthly.
"The proposed IRB aims at taxing each and every one who is legally required to pay tax. If a temple earns an income from leasing out its property, rooms or a building and collects revenue by by issuing tickets to visitors will be liable for tax," the minister said.
The government expects to pass the IRB by next month after introducing the amendments and the determination by the Supreme Court. We also expect to introduce further amendments proposed by the public and the Opposition at the committee stage. The Bill will be finalized in a transparent manner,' he said.
Referring to the allegations made by the JO that the government was attempting to even tax beggars, he said, "Yes, why not, if the beggar earns Rs.10,000 a day
The minister said the government would discuss with the Mahasangha before imposing any new tax on income generated by temples and other places of religious or culturally important sites. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Eight TN fishermen arrested
	
Sri Lankan Navy on Friday arrested eight Tamil Nadu fishermen for allegedly fishing in the restricted Sri Lankan territorial waters, an official from senior Indian fisheries told news agency PTI.
Nagapattinam joint fisheries director Amala Xavier told PTI that the arrested fishermen, who were taken to Kangesanthurai port, were from Nagapattinam district and were fishing off Nedubtheevu near the Sri Lankan coast.
It is the fifth such arrests made by Sri Lankan navy in the month of July. In a similar incident earlier this week, four fishermenfrom Jagadapattinam in Pudukottai district were arrested for allegedly fishing off Neduntheevu. Seven other fishermen from Mandapam were arrested on July 13 on similar charges.
Tamil Nadu Chief Minister K Palaniswami recently wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking him to find a permanent solution to recurring mid-sea arrests. Such continuing incidents of arrests of fishermen were a deliberate attempt by Sri Lanka to derail Indias efforts to find a permanent solution to the vexed issue, the Chief Minister wrote in a letter to PM Modi.

Govigama monopoly of presidents and premiers in Sri Lanka
	
By D.B.S.Jeyaraj

71-Year-old Lawyer Ram Nath Kovind has been elected on Thursday July 20th 2017 as the 14th President of India! An excerpt from Indian English daily
The Hindu stated as follows -

Ram Nath Kovind was on Thursday declared elected as Indias 14th President polling 65.6% of the vote defeating the Oppositions joint candidate, former Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar, who secured 34% of the vote. Mr. Kovind will be the second Dalit President of India after late President K.R. Narayanan but, more significantly, the first from politically significant Uttar Pradesh and the first person from the BJP to hold the office of President since Independence.
Speaking to the press after returning officer for the poll, Anoop Mishra, declared him elected, Mr. Kovind said it was an emotional moment for him.I never dreamed of this position nor was it a goal. My election to this post is a message to all those who discharge their duties with honesty and integrity, he said, promising to uphold the Constitution of India and follow the policy of Sarve Bhavantu Sukheenaha or peace and prosperity to all.
The Indian Presidency is largely a ceremonial, but symbolically significant post. The President is elected by members of the Indian Lower (Lok Sabha) and Upper (Rajya Sabha) houses of Parliament along with members of the various state legislatures (legislative assemblies). The votes are graded accordingly and allocated a particular value. In the current presidential poll the total number of MPs and MLAs who cast their votes was 4851, bearing a combined value of 1090300. However, with 77 votes being declared invalid  21 from Parliament alone  the total number of valid votes was 4774, bearing a combined value of 1069358. Mr. Kovind nominated by the BJP led govt polled 2930 of these votes  bearing a value of 702044  while the opposition candidate Ms. Kumar gained 1844 votes  with a value of 367314. 
As a keen observer of the Indian political scene for many decades, the election of an Indian President is an exercise I greatly admire. What I have been impressed about most is the tradition followed by successive Indian Governments of electing presidents reflecting the mixed population of the country at large. India has through a deliberate process of selection ensured over the years that members of the regional, religious and linguistic minorities are rotated as Presidents of India. In recent times caste and gender too have become relevant factors. 

Even though titular the Indian head of state does have prestige and stature as the President of the worlds largest democracy. More interesting and important perhaps is the fact that the Indian presidency has evolved over the years as a symbol of that Countrys vast diversity and ethnic pluralism

After 20 years of independence from the British and partition, India elected its first Muslim President in 1967. There have been two more Muslim presidents thereafter in 1974 and 2002.The first Sikh President was elected in 1982. Presidents have been elected from the Southern States of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka,Tamil Nadu and Kerala as well as the Non - Hindi speaking states of Maharashtra and West Bengal. The first woman President was elected in 2007. The first depressed caste (Dalit) president was elected 50 years after independence in 1997. Now 70 years after independence a second Dalit president has been elected. Interestingly enough the opposition candidate Ms. Meira Kumar is the daughter of legendary Dalit leader Jagjivan Ram. Had she won India would still have had both its second Dalit president and first Dalit woman president..Thus the Indian presidential elections manifest an evolving tradition of recognizing the diversity and plurality that is India in a symbolic manner. 
Indias First Prime Minister
Even the Prime Ministerial office in India has begun to reflect the multi-ethnic, multi-religious, multi-linguistic, multi- caste society of India over the years. The Hindi speaking people form the largest linguistic group in India. They number about 41% of the population. Other linguistic groups form the rest. Religion wise Hindus form 80% of the population. Muslims are about 15 %. In the early years after Independence most Prime Ministers came from Hindi speaking Uttar Pradesh which is also Indias most populous state. Indias first Prime minister Jawarhalal Nehru hailed from Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh (UP) but he was actually of Kashmiri pundit Brahmin lineage. His successor Lal Bahadur Shastri was also from UP. So too was Indias third and first woman Prime Minister Indira Gandhi who was Nehrus daughter. Indira married Feroze Gandhi a Parsee. Their son Rajiv became Prime Minister in 1984. He too contested from a UP constituency. 
There have been other premiers from the Hindi speaking states like Chaudhari Charan Singh, V. P. Singh , Chandra Shekhar Singh and Atal Bihari Vajpayee. However there have been Prime ministers from Non-Hindi speaking states too. The first elected non -Hindi Prime minister was Morarji Desai a Gujarati. The present Premier Narendra Modi is from Gujarat too. Gulzarilal Nanda who served twice as acting prime minister after the deaths of Nehru and Shastri was a Punjabi Hindu. So too was Inder Kumar Gujral. P. Narasimha Rao and H. D. Deve Gowda from the southern states of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka respectively have also been Prime ministers. No Muslim has been elected Prime minister, but a Sikh Dr. Manmohan Singh was Premier from 2004 to 2014. 
The election and/or appointment of Prime Ministers depend on electoral results and political power equations. Though non - Hindi speakers have become PMs it wasnt due to deliberate design. However as far as the symbolic Indian presidency is concerned, one is able to discern a definite and consistent method of trying to elect Presidents representing and reflecting the plural heritage of India. The latest election has seen a Hindu from Hindi speaking Uttar Pradesh being elected president, but the significant plus point is that he is a Dalit. The Dalits are supposedly of socio-culturally inferior castes.Thus President Kovinds victory is testimony to the multi-caste social structure of India and a victory for those seeking the eradication of caste inequality. 

While most caste groups have political representation at different levels and different degrees, it is the Govigama and Vellala castes that dominate the politics of the Sinhala and Tamil people respectively


Compare and contrast
Whenever Presidential polls are held in India, I have a tendency to compare and contrast it with the situation in Sri Lanka. Like India, Sri Lanka too has a multi-ethnic, multi- religious , muti-caste society. Sinhalese comprise 75% While Tamils, Muslims, Burghers, Malays and other ethnic groups comprise the rest.Religion wise Buddhists who are predominantly Sinhala form 70% of the population.Hindus, Muslims and Christians are the other major religious groups. The percentages in terms of caste are difficult to gauge. It could be surmised that the Govigamas as well as the Vellalas are the numerically large castes within the Sinhala and Sri Lankan Tamil people. While most caste groups have political representation at different levels and different degrees, it is the Govigama and Vellala castes that dominate the politics of the Sinhala and Tamil people respectively. 
I know its distasteful to discuss caste in public, but in Sri Lanka as in India, the caste factor cant be ignored as far as politics and arranged marriages are concerned. The caste factor came to the fore in political discussions in India when two Dalitcandidates competed for the presidency. Indian analysts delve into this topic without inhibitions. Likewise the element of caste cant be ignored in Sinhala or Tamil politics in Sri Lanka. So let us look at this issue more honestly and less hypocritically . 
As stated earlier the numerically dominant caste among the Sinhalese are the  Govigamas. Their counterparts among the Tamils are the Vellalas. Since Independence from the British in 1948 all Prime Ministers and Presidents in Sri Lanka with one solitary exception have been from the majority Sinhala race, majority Buddhist Religion and majority Govigama caste. The only exception (some say aberration) was Ranasinghe Premadasa who was a Sinhala Buddhist, but not from the dominant Govi caste. 
The first Ceylonese Governor  General (G-G) in 1954 was Sir Oliver Goonetilleke, a Sinhala Govi protestant Christian. In 1962 Sir Oliver was replaced by a Kandyan Radala William Gopallawa as G- G. Governor-General Gopallawa transformed into President Gopallawa in 1972 after the Republican Constitution was promulgated.In 1978 came J.R.Jayewardenes executive Presidency. Thereafter the Prime Minister post became relatively powerless. Even then it has been a Sinhala, Buddhist, Govigama preserve with the exception of Premadasa who shattered the glass ceilings of both the Premiership and Presidency in 1978 and 1988 respectively. 
CP de Silva was the only non  Govigama caste member who could have become Prime Minster in 1960 as leader of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party(SLFP). He was thwarted by the Governor - General Sir Oliver Goonetilleke who was to later express his misgivings about a PM from the Salagamacaste to political leaders such as S.J.V. Chelvanayagam and Dr.N.M.Perera. CP de Silva was an old Thomian and ex - civil servant with a proven track record as administrator. He also had the numbers in Parliament to form a majority govt.Yet Sir Oliver opted to dissolve Parliament instead of appointing the Minneriya Deiyo as PM. Later on CP de Silvas party opted for Sirima Ratwatte Bandaranaike from Balangoda to Charles Percival de Silva from Balapitiya as SLFP leader. CP stepped down voluntarily. However in 1964 he defected to the opposition with a group of 14 MPs. At least six of the defectors were from the Salagama caste. 

D.S. to Ranil Wickremesinghe
Every Prime Minister of Ceylon/Sri Lanka from D. S. Senanayake to Ranil Wickremesinghe (except Premadasa) has been from the Govigama caste. Every President from William Gopallawa to Maithripala Sirisena (except Premadasa) has been from the Govigama caste. Even the progressively enlightened Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga who broke barriers of religion,caste and class in personal life by marrying Vijaya could not break such barriers in political life. When the time came to replace her mother Sirima Bandaranaike as Prime minister there were many suitable non -Govigama aspirants like Nimal Siripala de Silva, G.L.Peiris and Mangala Samaraweera. Yet she chose the lacklustre Ratnasiri Wickramanayake as premier. Sir Oliver Goonetilleke who served as Governor - General for 8 years was a Christian, but a Govigama. The only non - Govigama to be Premier and President was Ranasinghe Premadasa, but he was a Sinhala Buddhist. 
If this was the plight of persons who were Sinhala and Buddhist but not Govikula, then what chances do the ethnic and religious minority community members have in Sri Lanka at this point of time None whatsoever!! The only non - Sinhala, non-Buddhist who could have aspired to the Prime Minister post under an executive presidency was former Foreign minister Lakshman Kadirgamar. However Lakshman Kadirgamar learnt a bitter lesson when Chandrika Kumaratunga wanted to make him Prime Minister. Mahinda Rajapakse sabotaged the move to become Premier in 2004. But it was possible that Rajapakse may have made Kadirgamar Premier for cosmetic purposes at least after attaining the executive presidency in November 2005. Speculation on that count however is irrelevant as the tigers killed Kadirgamar before the Presidential elections itself. A political tradition of inclusiveness reflecting the plural heritage and ethno-cultural diversity of a country has to be gradually evolved. The practices maintained currently in India with regard to the Presidency was carefully built up over the years. A brief re-run of the history of Indian presidents and the nature of the presidency is worthwhile and necessary at this juncture to understand how this inclusive and broadly representative tradition evolved over the years. I have written on these lines on earlier occasions and would be drawing upon such writings in this article. 
The Indian Presidency unlike that of countries like Sri Lanka, USA, Russia or France is not an executive Presidency. Its more of a ceremonial post like that of the Governor  General when Sri Lanka was Ceylon or that of the President before Junius Richard Jayewardene transformed it as an Executive President. Even though titular the Indian head of state does have prestige and stature as the President of the worlds largest democracy. More interesting and important perhaps is the fact that the Indian presidency has evolved over the years as a symbol of that Countrys vast diversity and ethnic pluralism. 
Despite various challenges from within and without India has remained strong and united. India has fourteen major national languages and over 250 minor languages and dialects. All the major religions of the world are found there. Its regions are widely disparate and unevenly developed. Moreover India is plagued by caste differences. Fissiparous tendencies were galore in the early years of Independence. Many analysts predicted fragmentation within years. The Indian state and elite were so paranoid about divisive tendencies that they downplayed the federalism  of its Constitution and instead emphasised on its unitary characteristics. 

The prevailing tradition of appointing minority community members was broken

Accommodating diversity
In stark contrast,Sri Lanka has only two premier languages, three major ethnicities and four chief religions. Sadly political muddling and lack of vision led to disintegrating chaos and a destructive civil war.But Mother India was fortunate in having enlightened children to lead the nation.The Nehruvian vision of accommodating diversity and forging unity in practical terms laid the groundwork for a strong, united India to emerge. Re- organizing states on a linguistic basis, secularism and co-operative federalism were the key elements that went into re  inventing modern India. 
In Sri Lanka it was the opposite with Sinhala being imposed as sole official language, Buddhism being given foremost place and rabid opposition to any meaningful form of the federal idea or power sharing.. The end result of this process is now clearly and tragically visible. An important reason  if not the only one  for this contrasting state of affairs between India and Sri Lanka is the accommodative spirit displayed by Indian policy makers and administrators in celebrating diversity and practising pluralism. This spirit was absent among the dominant political class and bureaucracy in Sri Lanka. 
It is said in lighter vein that the cohesive bonds keeping modern India together are the Indian civil service, Railways, Cricket, Hindi Cinema, English language and the Institution of the Indian Presidency.The Rashtrapathy though a ceremonial post has developed over the years into an institution symbolising pluralism and reflecting diversity.This process has been strengthened not through legislation or litigation but through an interesting on going process of usage and convention. The spirit of accommodation has through practice forged a rough pattern in selecting Presidential candidates. 
As stated earlier the idea has been that of giving recognition and representation to all of Indias diverse ethnicities, regions and religions. This unwritten procedure has more weight than written laws or rules.The evolution and growth of the Indian presidency and the different strands of society reflected and recognized by that Institution is an interesting tale worth recounting. 
After Independence, the first Indian to be Governor  General of the Dominion was a Tamil Brahmin C. Rajagopalschari or Rajaji. Meanwhile a Constituent assembly presided over By Dr. BR Ambedkar drafted Indias Republican Constitution. India became a Republic formally on Jan 26th 1950. The first President was Rajendra Prasad. He was a Hindi speaker. Prasad was a man of great stature and a political personality on par with Jawarhalal Nehru. In the old days of left and right Prasad was a rightist and Nehru left of Centre.With Prasads elevation to the Presidency a potential rival to Nehru was sidelined.

This in a sense is reminiscent of D.S Senanayakes stratagem in persuading Sir Baron Jayatilleke to become Envoy to India.Newly elected Ram Nath Kovind is the 14th President of India. Actually he would have been the 15th but for Rajendra Prasad becoming President for a second term in 1957. He is the only President to have served for two successive terms. 
In 1962 the eminent scholar and philosopher Dr. S. Radhakrishnan became President. He was vice  president earlier. Radhakrishnan though a resident of Chennai was a Telugu by ethnicity. The South Indian Radhakrishnan was the President when Nehru died in 1964 and also when Nehrus successor Lal Bahadur Shastri passed away in 1966. 

The celebration of diversity and the conscious effort to recognize plurality lies at the core of Indias comparative success in crisis management

Indias first Muslim President
After Radhakrishnan another scholar and educationist Dr. Zakir Hussain became President in 1967. He was Indias first Muslim President. A member of a regional and linguistic minority was followed by a member from a religious minority.The Prime Ministers up to that time were from the majority Hindi speaking Uttar Pradesh. But the Presidency was rotated to accommodate Minority members. 
Zakir Hussain died in office in 1969. The Presidential stakes became a power struggle. On the one hand was the old guard party hierarchy known as the syndicate while on the other was Indira Gandhi attempting to break free of those who had installed her in office.The syndicate consisting of people like S. Nijalingappa, Kamaraj, SK Patil, Atulya Ghosh etc wanted the speaker N. Sanjiva Reddy to be President; Indira wanted the vice  president VV Giri to succeed Hussain.The elections saw Indira calling upon Congress members to defy the party high command and vote for Giri. There was a third candidate C. Deshmukh fielded by Rajajis Swathantra party. Giri won. The Congress party split. 

VV Giri a former High Commissioner to Sri Lanka was a Kannadiga from the Karnataka state. The Muslim Hussain was succeeded by a linguistic and regional minority member.1974 saw Giris term of office ending. He was succeeded by Fakhruddhin Ali Ahmed a North Indian Muslim. He was a cabinet minister and Indira Gandhi loyalist. So India had a religious minority member as President again.

1977 saw Ali Ahmed passing away while holding presidential office just as Zakir Hussain. Meanwhile Indira Gandhi was defeated in the polls. A Janatha coalition was in power with Morarji Desai from Gujerat as Prime Minister.Neelam Sanjiva Reddy was made President. He was the man defeated in 1969 by VV Giri. Reddy was a Telugu from Andhra Pradesh. Once again a regional and linguistic minority member was President. Indira returned to power in 1980. In 1982 Giani Zail Singh was made President. He was a Sikh from Punjab and a devout loyalist of Indira Gandhi. So another religious minority community member was President.1987 saw the Vice  president R. Venkatraman succeeding Zail Singh. Venkatraman was a Tamil brahmin from Tamil Nadu and had been a cabinet minister earlier. Thus a regional cum linguistic minority community member was President.Rajiv Gandhi was killed in 1991. The new Congress government had PV Narasimha Rao as Prime Minister. Rao was from Andhra Pradesh. For the first time a South Indian was Prime Minister. 
In 1992 it was time for Venkstraman to step down as president.. His Vice  president was Shankar Dayal Sharma, a hindi speaking North Indian. With the PM being a South Indian, the North Indian Sharma became President.The prevailing tradition of appointing minority community members was broken. But the Premier was South Indian. In 1966 another South Indian Deve Gowda from Karnataka became Premier. 

First Dalit President
In 1997 KR Narayanan the vice  president succeeded Sharma. Narayanan a former career diplomat hailed from the South Indian state of Kerala. Once again a regional and linguistic minority community member was President. Now all four Dravidian states had enjoyed stints as President. Narayanan also set another precedent. He belonged to the so called low caste Dalit community. Thus after fifty years of Independence casteist India had a Dalit as President. Besides Narayanan also had christian links because of his wife and siblings who had converted. 
When Narayanan stepped down in 2002 the Bharatiya Janata party led coalition was in power. Jayalalitha Jayaram the actress turned politico was chief minister of Tamil Nadu. She proposed Abdul Kalam the famous nuclear scientist as President. Kalam was a Tamil speaking Muslim from Rameshwaram in the South of Tamil Nadu.. Hussein and Ali Ahmed were Urdu speaking Muslims. Abdul Kalam was a celebrity in his own right as the scientist credited with Indias nuclear capability.It made political sense for the Hindu rightist BJP regime to re- furbish its image by making a Muslim the President. Jayalalitha was happy about a Thamizhan becoming President.Tamil speaking Muslims in Tamil Nadu perceive themselves as Tamils observing Islam as a religion.They do not see themselves as separate from Tamil Hindus or Christians on account of their religion. 
2007 was time for Abdul Kalam to end his term of office. The vice  president was Bhairon Singh Shekhawat a Rajput from Hindi  speaking Rajasthan. He was a former BJP Chief minister of Rajasthan.The Congress did not want a BJP politician as President. So it selected Pratibha Patil who was then Governor of Rajasthan as the Govt candidate with the approval of its allies like the DMK and the Communist and Marxist parties. Shekhawat himself contested as an independent .The Presidential poll saw Pratibha Patil defeating her rival easily. Pratibha hailed from Maharashtra state and was ethnically a Mahratta. Maharashtra is neither North nor South but in Central or West of India. The Mahrattas are a distinct entity speaking the Marathi language. 

First woman president
Thus a regional and linguistic minority community member became President again. More importantly Prathiba Patil was the first woman to be elected as President of India. This was indeed a commendable milepost.In 2012 the ruling Congress led coalition Govt nominated senior minister Pranab Mukherjee as its presidential candidate. Mukherjee was also from a non - Hindi state. He was a Bengali hailing from West Bengal state. Now a Hindu Dalit from Uttar Pradesh has become president.The BJP has been long accused of being an upper caste (Brahmin and Bania) oriented party. Electing a Dalit as president would help dispel this image. Besides at the recent UP polls, a sizable number of Dalits had voted for the BJP. Thus it made sense for the BJP to elect a Dalit Hindu from Uttar pradesh as president. Despite these political considerations the election has proved to be victory for the accommodative tradition. The celebration of diversity and the conscious effort to recognize plurality lies at the core of Indias comparative success in crisis management. The tradition of rotating the Presidency among regional, religious, linguistic and caste minorities is a healthy expression of that mindset. 
When compared to the success story of India in this sphere, Sri Lankas story has been a sad one. Political power has been entrenched with the Sinhala - Buddhist -Govugama - majority that seems to perceive its numerical superiority almost as a divine right. Not only is there unwillingness to share power with the minorities but even symbolic recognition of the islands diversity and plurality seems impossible. It is this reluctance to share power even symbolically and the gross insensitivity of the ruling class to issues like this that lie at the core of the crisis in Sri Lanka. The unwillingness of the dominant group to share power is manifest in the election/appointment of the President and Prime Minister. 
Will Sri Lanka Ever Have.......
Will Sri Lanka ever have a non - Sinhala, non - Buddhist President or Prime Minister Even more importantly perhaps is the pointed question - Will Sri Lanka break the Govigama monopoly and have a non _Govigama President or Prime Minister in the near future

NEW DELHI AFP July20, 2017- Indias stand in its border dispute with China is supported by other countries, Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj said Thursday as she praised tiny Bhutan for standing up to China in the row. 
Swaraj reaffirmed that Indias security could be jeopardised if China takes over the zone where the frontiers of India, China and Bhutan meet. 
The standoff started more than a month ago after Chinese troops started building a road on the remote plateau, which is disputed by China and Bhutan. 
Indian troops moved in to the flashpoint zone to halt the work. 
All the countries are understanding that Indias stand is not wrong. Justice is on our side, this is being accepted by all other countries, the minister told the upper house of the
Indian parliament. 
China has also declared that it has international support, with its foreign ministry saying on Tuesday that foreign diplomats were shocked by Indias 
illegal trespass.

Pakistan arrests top official for forgery in Sharif graft case
	

ISLAMABAD AFP July21, 2017-  The chairman of Pakistans financial regulator was arrested Friday, accused of forging documents in a corruption case against Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif that has gripped the country. 
Head of the Securities and Exchange Commission Zafar Hijazi was accused by investigators of doctoring the records of a sugar mill owned by the Sharif family. 
Hijazi, who is seen as a trusted ally of Sharif, had appeared in court on Friday morning for a bail hearing and was arrested during the proceedings. 
The arrest comes just over a week after the investigating team, tasked by the Supreme Court with probing the graft claims, said that documents naming Sharifs daughter Maryam as a trustee for several of the familys high-end London properties were also falsified. The allegations are fuelling intense pressure on Sharif from opposition parties to resign. His main political rival, cricketer-turned-opposition leader Imran Khan, has called for him to be sent to the prison.

India should approach third parties, such as the US and China, to mediate in the Kashmir issue, former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Farooq Abdullah said on Friday. 
The National Conference (NC) leader said India has so many allies across the globe, which can be approached for settling the Kashmir issue and act as a mediator between India and Pakistan. 
For how long are you going to wait Sometimes, you have to pull the bull by its horns. The way is to have a dialogue. India has so many friends all across the world. They can ask them to act as a mediator. US President Trump himself said that he wants to settle Kashmir problem. China also said that it wants to mediate in Kashmir. Somebody has to be approached, Abdullah said.  If India is ready to talk to China and does not want to get into war, then they can talk to Pakistan also, he added. 
Quoting former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees statement that friends can be changed, but not neighbours, the NC leader said arrogance and stubbornness would not let any of the nations progress and develop. If the youth of tomorrow are targeted today, how will they run the nation I would like to urge the government to expose the perpetrators, he said. We are being sandwiched. People die every day. The situation is worse in the Valley, he added.

Two dead, dozens hurt as quake hits Greek and Turkish resorts
	

Greece/Turkey, (Daily Mail), 21 July 2017 - Two people died and hundreds injured after a powerful earthquake struck off the Turkish coast overnight, triggering a tsunami that hit tourist resorts in the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas and damaging buildings across the region. 
The epicentre of the magnitude-6.7 quake was off Bodrum, southwest Turkey, with the countrys Aegean coast and Greek holiday islands including Kos and Rhodes
worst affected. 
Holidaymakers fled hotels in terror and some even jumped from balconies as the quake hit before running for their lives to higher ground as tsunami waves surged through beachfront resorts moments later, flooding bars and restaurants, carrying away cars and depositing boats in town streets. 
On the island of Kos, where a state of emergency has been declared, two male tourists - a 22-year-old from Sweden and a 39-year-old from Turkey - were killed after being crushed under a collapsed ceiling at the White Corner Club bar. Another man from Sweden has lost both of his legs, police said. 
Parts of a historic mosque in Kos Town also came crashing down into the street and rescuers were this morning sifting through rubble looking for trapped survivors. 
n Turkey, at least 70 people were admitted to hospitals in Bodrum.

US to ban American citizens from travelling to North Korea
	

US, (Daily Mail), 21 July 2017 - Two tourist agencies that operate tours to North Korea said on Friday the U.S. government will soon ban its citizens from travelling to the North. 
Koryo Tours said the ban would be announced on July 27 and would go into effect 30 days later. 
It said the Swedish embassy in Pyongyang, which handles consular affairs for the United States in the North, informed it of the ban, but did not say how long it would last. But it does seem to be the case that in just over a month, it will be impossible for Americans to visit as tourists, said Koryo Tours general manager Simon Cockrell. 
Another tour operator, Young Pioneer Tours, said on its website that it had also been informed of the ban, citing the same date. 
It is expected that the ban will come into force within 30 days of July 27th.
