Globally, 800,000 suicides are reported annually. This number is higher compared to those killed as a result of wars or homicides. It also means theres a suicide every 40 seconds.

British MP denies 100K SL holiday claim
	
British MP Ian Paisley has rejected allegations levelled against him and said he did not declare 100,000 in hospitality from the Sri Lankan government, the BBC reported on Friday.
A newspaper report earlier said the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP and his family took two all-expenses-paid holidays to Sri Lanka in 2013.
The Daily Telegraph said he recently met Sri Lankan officials to discuss the possibility of post-Brexit trade deals with Sri Lanka.
But the MP said the report was "devoid of fact or logic" and "defamatory".
In response to the Sri Lankan holiday claims, a DUP spokesman said: "Ian Paisley MP will rightly refer himself to the [Parliamentary] Commissioner for Standards. "We await the outcome of that investigation."
The newspaper reported that the Paisely family flew business-class to Sri Lanka and stayed in luxurious hotels.
It estimated the total worth of the trips at about 100,000 and claimed the cost and expenses were paid for by the Sri Lankan government.
Mr. Paisley this week tweeted a picture of himself meeting the Sri Lankan High Commissioner Amari Wijewardene "to discuss NI-Sri Lanka trade deal after Brexit".
Two days later he tweeted a picture of himself with International Trade Secretary Liam Fox "discussing our trade agreements post-Brexit".
The 50-year-old MP is the son of the late Ian Paisley, founder and former leader of the DUP, now the largest political party in Northern Ireland.

British TUs: End the 1% pay cap or  face waves of strikes
	
UK, (Daily Mail), 7 September 2017 - Britains Labour Party and trade unions yesterday threatened Prime Minister Theresa May with a fresh round of strikes unless she agrees to increases in public sector pay. 
Nurses held a demonstration in front of Parliament to demand an end to the 1 per cent cap on pay for state workers, which has been in force since 2010. 
Meanwhile, the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union, which represents civil servants, announced it will ballot its members on whether to launch a campaign of industrial action. 
John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, blamed the Prime Minister for any future strikes, saying she was provoking public sector workers.The PCS union said civil service pay had fallen by between 2,000 and 3,500 in real terms from 2010 to 2016  and demanded pay rises of at least 5 per cent for all public sector workers.

CEB Workers Union on indefinite strike from Sept.13
	
The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) Workers Union announced yesterday that it would engage in an indefinite strike from September 13 over several demands including the revision of the salary ratio from 1:6 to 1:9.
Addressing the media at the Centre for Society and Religion (CSR), Union Secretary Ranjan Jayalal said the salary scales of administrative officers at the CEB had been increased on numerous occasions, but the salary scale of lower level employees remained unchanged.
Speaking of salary anomalies, Mr. Jayalal said the administrative staff had a raise on January 8, 2008 through a circular. However, another circular increasing the salaries of non-executives and non-engineers had been issued on the same day. Yet, there had been no news of such increments to lower level employees.
Due to these increments, the ratio of the salary between administrative staff and lower level employees has widened to 1:9, whereas it was 1:6 in 2015, Mr. Jayalal said.
The union has decided to launch a two-day strike on September 13 initially to give time to the government and relevant high ranking officials to revise the salary ratios.
If we do not receive a favourable response by September 15, we will continue the strike indefinitely, he said.
Mr. Jayalal confirmed that the supply of electricity would not be disrupted by the strike.
If there were issues during the strike, relevant officials will have to resolve them personally as lower level employees will not be available at work. We had discussions with the subject minister and other officials. We did everything we could, hoping that our demands will be met. As it is not the case, we resorted to hold a strike. It is now the ministers turn to speak up and reveal to the public the burden of corruption palmed off to them by the higher levels of the CEB, he said.
He said the union had no political or personal agenda, and that the only thing they benefited from the move was hopefully a change in the salary ratio. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Central Expressway's construction work will go ahead: PM
	
All alternatives, including the construction of an airport in Kandy were looked at by the government, but it is not possible to change the plans to construct the central expressway, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament today.
There was a plan to construct an airport in Kandy. One can travel there on a small airplane. But it is not possible to stop the construction of this expressway," he said. The central expressway comprises three tunnels. We will have to re-look at the tunnels as well. One part of the expressway would be elevated.The expressways built earlier was done by filling creating environmental issues."
The Prime Minister said the central expressway was just one of the many development projects lined up for the Central Province where a tourism and cultural centre, an agriculture technology centre, and an IT Park would be constructed.
He said the government was able to reduce the cost of the central highway by Rs.25 billion by bringing down the initial estimated cost of Rs.159 billion to the current estimated cost of Rs.134 billion.
The Prime Minister funds would be obtained from the Tokyo Mitsubishi Bank on a decision of the Department of External Assets and added that there were no proper responses when tenders were called initially.
He said Japanese government gave an assurance that it would ensure there would be a response later and said when tenders were called again in November 2016 two Japanese companies -- Taisai and Fujitha responded.
"The Cabinet decided to award the tender to Fujitha but the Cabinet-appointed negotiation committee held that Fujitha was not able to comply with two of the stipulated criteria. Then it was decided to award the tender to Taisai which had by then had reduced the cost of the project. Japan asked me during my visit whether it would be possible to get Fujitha also involved and as such it was decided to get Fuijtha to merge with Taisai," the Prime Minister said and added that these two companies would handle the first phase of the project.
He said both India and China would be involved in other phases of the project.
Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake said Rs.4.1 billion would be spent on a kilometer even at the reduced cost and recalled that even President Maithripala Sirisena had said the tender procedure was violated when awarding the contract for the expressway.

Do you find it difficult to fall asleep at night
	

Its essential for every living organism to have rest and proper sleep after engaging in hundreds of daily activities. A healthy sleep is defined as the duration and quality of sleep which optimizes an individual to maintain the maximum alertness while being awake. Generally, an adult needs around 8 hours of sleep, even though the individual requirement may vary based on several factors. Children and adolescents usually need more than 8 hours of sleep, but after the age 4, the necessity will gradually lessen and reach approximately 8 hours. 

There are various types of sleeping disorders where Insomnia and Sleep Apnea are known to be two ofthe commonest. 

What is Insomnia
Being the commonest type of sleep disorder, Insomnia is defined as the difficulty to fall asleep or the difficulty in maintaining sleep every night or most nights. This condition prevails despite having adequate opportunity to sleep. Other variable symptoms and signs of this disorder include waking up too early in the morning, the inability to fall back to sleep even if necessary and going through episodes of uncomfortable or disturbed sleep. Consequences of Insomnia may vary from one person to another and include irritability, tiredness and poor concentration. 
Insomnia can occur without any clear etiology, due to stress, anxiety, nicotine, caffeine, excessive alcohol, drug abuse, over-the-counter drugs, menopause, hormonal disturbances in women, chronic pain etc. But the condition can also be a symptom associated with several mental and physical health conditions like depression, hypothyroidism, high blood pressure, heart diseases, asthma, arthritis and nasal allergies or sinusitis. Furthermore, Insomnia can also be linked with other sleeping disorders like Sleep Apnea and restless leg syndrome. 
There are several types of Insomnia such as; general Insomnia which usually last one night up to several weeks, chronic insomnia lasting for months to years, Transient insomnia lasting for a short time and intermittent insomnia which occasionally recurs with comparatively shorter episodes of sleeplessness. 
The modalities of treatment available for individuals with Insomnia, mainly depend on the root cause which results in disturbed sleep. However, in addition to obtaining treatment for underlying conditions, it is important to make lifestyle modifications such as avoiding distractions during sleep (noise, television, music), scrapping altogether or shortening the duration of naps during day time, consuming a light diet at night, refraining from having caffeine and nicotine and altering drugs. Its essential to obtain medical advice and proper training to have a healthy sleep pattern. 

Take home message
Insomnia is defined as a condition of broad range where an individual has trouble falling and maintaining sleep whereas Sleep Apnea is a physical condition which takes place when breathing of an individual gets interrupted during sleep. 

Sleep Apnea will usually take place due to an underlying physical condition, but not as a result of anxiety or depression

Even though Insomnia can occur due to various mental health problems such as depression or mood swings like anxiety, Sleep Apnea will usually take place due to an underlying physical condition, but not as a result of anxiety or depression. 


What is Sleep Apnea
This is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition which is characterized by repetitive and brief disruptions of airflow while being asleep. Being a condition which owns a male predominance, Sleep Apnea is commoner in people over 40 years of age and often go undiagnosed in women. 
Risk factors:

Advanced age 
	Increased alcohol consumption 
	Sedatives 
	Obesity 
	Congestive cardiac failure 
	Stroke 
	Head injury 
There are several types of Sleep Apnea where Obstructive Sleep Apnea is known to be the commonest. The cause for this condition is the blockage of the airway due to reasons such as excessive tissue content in obese people, narrowed air ways due to asthma and anatomical anomalies including enlarged tonsils orlarge uvula . 
As far as the pathophysiology of Sleep Apnea is considered, disrupted air entry into the lungs through nose and mouth makes it difficult for an individual to breath. This results in an increased effort during respiration leading to a creation of a suction force in the upper airway tract. This whole scenario will result in the further collapsing of airways with a sound of involuntary snoring associated with a break in the airflow. Also, due to the low concentration of oxygen and increased concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood, the signals will be sent to the brain which will stimulate the relaxation of muscles in the airway from time to time. This process will result in episodes of normal sleep and sudden awakening associated with loud gasps. 
Due to the fundamental pathophysiology mentioned above, individuals with Sleep Apnea will have a history of loud or frequent snoring, silent pauses during breathing, choking, gasping, daytime sleepiness, fatigue, insomnia, morning headaches and nocturia (awakening during sleep at night to go to the bathroom). 
Eliminating the root cause and treating any underlying health condition play a major role in the management of Sleep Apnea. In addition, lifestyle modifications such as regular exercises, weight reduction, healthy diet and the quitting of smoking and alcohol will also help to improve the condition.

## Title: Ear Wax: Natures earplugs

Ear Wax: Natures earplugs
	

We are all too familiar with the red brown wax produced in our ears. Many of us attempt to clean it off using cotton buds and other objects. But what you are really doing is pushing the wax further in. Many people are unaware of how you have to deal with ear wax which is why the Health Capsule approached Dr. Chandra Jayasuriya, Consultant ENT Surgeon, National Hospital, Colombo. Dr. Jayasuriya gave us a comprehensive explanation on wax impaction and how ear wax should be treated. 

Production
The ear canal comprises of cartilage and bones, covered by skin. Ear wax is produced within the cartilage function of ear canals.Wax is there for a purpose, it is a protective action. Wax is only produced in the outer part of the ear canal, not the deeper part of it. So the ear is like a tunnel actually and the dead cells in the skin should come out from the deeper part of the ear canal to the outside of the ear, Dr. Jayasuriya explained. 

Epithelial Migration
Speaking of how the wax exits the ear she said, The ear wax usually comes out with the exfoliated skin epithelial cells. This skin epithelial is a special because there is maturity. It matures from downwards to upwards so the deep cells are young and the topmost cells are very matured when they come out. It is said that when we wash our body we wash the dead skin cells off, but in the ear canal it isnt possible because it is like a tunnel. So there is a special mechanism for these dead cells to come out. They migrate from the deep part of the ear canal towards the outside or from the centre of the ear drum to the origin of the ear canal. This is called epithelial migration,she explained.
Furthermore she said, Some people are born without this mechanism. When they are born without this mechanism there is wax impaction, which means that wax gets collected inside the ear. Regarding such people, doctors have to take the wax out. There is nothing else that can be done,Dr. Jayasuriya said.
Wax impaction
Speaking of wax impaction Dr. Jayasuriya said, The ear canal has both bone, in the deeper part of the ear, and cartilage on the outside of the ear. When the cartilage produces wax it mixes with the dead epithelial cells and naturally comes out. We have to then eventually wash it off. For people who arent born with this mechanism, the wax can build up within the ear and cause erosion and damage to the bone of the ear canal. In such cases patients will have to go to an ENT surgeon to get the wax extracted. Some extreme extractions are even done under anaesthesia. Some patients, due to the continuous use of cotton buds, too suffer from wax impaction. 
In elderly people wax can build up due to the use of hearing aids and even the use of earphones can cause wax build up, she added. 

Wax extraction
She further explained how ear wax is extracted. When extracting wax we either use the suction method, where you suck the wax out of the ear. Or we can use the syringe method, where water is used to remove it. Sometimes a microscope is used and the wax is removed under magnification,she said.
Washing and cleaning up are done by an expert. It has to be done by an experienced doctor; either by an ENT surgeon or an experienced general practice surgeon who has been trained. After washing the ear you have to wipe dry the excess water. Otherwise fungus can build up in this moist environment. People who are born without epithelial migration have to make an appointment with an ENT surgeon every 6 months in order to remove impacted ear wax. Simple wax isnt a problem and it will automatically come out. We dont have to make a special effort to remove it because if there is migration it can anyway come out without our interference. People who interfere with the process will get wax impaction. And due to the use of cotton buds they push the wax deeper inside, Dr. Jayasuriya emphasized. 

Symptoms
Speaking about the signs and symptoms of wax impaction Dr. Jayasuriya said,You wont be able to hear on that side. The destruction there can cause severe pain, bleeding, a bad smell and deafness. But with simple wax impaction there will only be deafness. Regarding small children, if they have large balls of wax, they might fare poorly at school. Such students might also misbehave because they wont hear what their teachers are saying,she said.

Exposition of Buddhas sacred hair relics in Kurunegala
	
The two-day exposition will take place at Athkanda Viharaya on September 10 and 11
Life is all about perspectives, the way we view things and the way you let such events and moments define your life. 
One such moment that will have a lasting effect on my life is the day I helped orchestrate the relocation of the sacred hair relics of the Buddha from Chittagong in Bangladesh to Sri Lanka.The historic event took place in 2007. I penned my thoughts some thirty-six thousand feet above The Indian Ocean while the Sacred Relics were flown. What I wrote was published in The Daily Mirror a few days later. 
One such moment that will have a lasting effect on my life is the day I helped orchestrate the relocation of the Sacred Hair Relics of the Buddha from Chittagong in Bangladesh to Sri Lanka
My circumstances have completely changed during the past ten years. I dont reside in Dhaka, Bangladesh any longer. Im not writing this from an air conditioned office in the thick humidity of a summery Colombo day, but rather on a very gloomy Melbourne winter night where the temperature hovers around a bearable 10 oC. I have swapped cold ice coffee for a hot chocolate to keep myself warm. Although a lot has changed during the past ten years, one thing that remains the same in my life is the centrality of the Sacred Hair Relics of the Buddha. What was started as a simple request from me to the Bangladesh Buddhist Association on the advice of the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Senanayake Aramaya in Madampe, Keerthi Senanayake, has today become a lifelong devotion. 
When the plan came to fruition and the Sacred Relics were successfully brought to Gangaramaya Temple, Colombo, besides the personal sense of fulfillment, the opportunity to let hundreds of thousands of Sri Lankan devotees pay homage to the Sacred Relics made me overwhelmed with emotion. Now, this fall in the second week of September, tens of thousands of devotees are yet again earning an opportunity to pay their respects to these relics. Though it is the 10th anniversary of the arrival of the Sacred Relics to Sri Lanka it also coincides with the eightieth birthday of my beloved mother, an individual of utmost purity, simplicity and devotion, without whom I wouldnt have been what I am today. 
What I learned from my initiative to bring the Scared Relics to Sri Lanka is the power of intention that if the intentions are noble and pure one can always be successful in whatever one aspires to achieve. I feel it is my duty and responsibility to make sure every Sri Lankan from all walks of life is given every opportunity to see and pay homage to the Sacred Hair Relics. Therefore I cordially invite all my fellow countrymen to join us in the exposition of Scared Relics of Buddha at Athkanda Raja MahaViharaya in Kurunegala. 
I would like to take this opportunity to pay homage to Ven.Galaboda Gnanessara Thero, the Chief Incumbent at Hunupitiya GangaramayaTemple and his deputy, Venerable Dr. Kirinde Assaji Thero for their guidance and assistance extended to us throughout these years in matters pertaining to the Sacred Relics. Besides I bow my head with a great sense of gratitude to Ven. Anamaduwe Rathanapala Buddharakkitha Thero, the Anunayaka Thero of the Asgiriya Chapter and Ven. Weerapokune Sumangala Thero of Athkanda Raja Maha Viharaya for coordinating the exposition in Kurunegala. I would also thank my family for provided me with unconditional support in organizing the event. 
May the merits of this noble deed bless Mother Lanka and may it assure many more years of good health and happiness to my mother.

Hurricane Irma wipes out 95% of  Barbuda and St Martin islands, killing over ten
	

Hurricane Irma howled past Puerto Rico with 185mph winds after reducing the tiny tropical islands of Barbuda and St Martin to rubble and claiming at least ten lives.

The category 5 storm - the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic - left a trail of deadly devastation through the Caribbean when it struck on Wednesday on a potential collision course with south Florida. 
Barbuda and St Martin suffered the storms full fury with roughly 95 per cent of properties destroyed on both islands. Officials said at least eight people died on the French part of St Martin - a pristine resort known for its vibrant nightlife. 
Its an enormous catastrophe. Ninety-five percent of the island is destroyed, top local official Daniel Gibbs said. Im in shock. Its frighteningThe island, which is divided between the Netherlands and France, was left without drinking water or electricity and the death toll is expected to rise. 
Barbuda, part of the twin island nation of Antigua and Barbuda, also suffered absolute devastation and is barely habitable with more than 90 per cent of dwellings completely destroyed, a child killed and 60 per cent of the population left homeless. 
Meanwhile, residents on the British Overseas Territory of Anguilla said the island was utterly devastated and looked as though it had suffered nuclear bomb devastation.This morning, the United Nations said up to 49 million people are in the hurricanes path as aid agencies prepare for a major humanitarian response.

If impartial trials held, half of MPs behind bars: VAC
	
The Voice Against Corruption (VAC) said yesterday if 89 investigations were followed through by the Attorney General, half of the government members would be imprisoned.
Addressing a press briefing, VAC Convener Wasantha Samarasinghe said although it revealed many fraudulent activities involving parliamentarians, not a single case was filed against these individuals in court despite inquiries being held.
The unity government came to power on the promise of taking legal action against corrupt individuals. This is not a united government but a government that is united in corruption, he said.
Commenting about the unused building rented out by the Agriculture Ministry, Mr. Samarasinghe said the building owner had been paid Rs. 23 million including VAT as service charge.
The transaction is an utter waste of public funds. The deal was made ignoring the guidelines set by the Auditor General. A total of Rs. 1,140 million has been paid as rental when the premises had not been used at least once in three years, and the agreement expires a year from now. However, the names of several ministers and their families surfaced on major corruption cases which we will expose in the coming weeks, he said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Samarasinghe appealed to President Maithripala Sirisena and relevant authorities to take prompt action against those responsible for corruption.
The VAC has already exposed corrupt government projects with justifiable evidence. If impartial trials were made on the accused, at least half of the government will have to be caged in the Welikada prison, he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

DAMASCUS AFP Sept7, 2017 - Syrias army accused Israeli warplanes of hitting one of its positions Thursday, killing two people in an attack that a monitor said targeted a site where the regime allegedly produces chemical weapons. 
The site near the Syrian town of Masyaf, between the central city of Hama and a port used by the Russian navy, is reportedly used by forces from Syrias allies Iran and the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah. 
Israel has previously carried out strikes believed to be targeting the transfer of weapons to Hezbollah, which fought a deadly war with the Jewish state in 2006. 
Thursdays strike hit a training camp and a branch of the Scientific Studies and Research Center (SSRC), an institution that Washington and former Israeli officials accuse of helping develop the sarin gas used in a deadly attack on the Syrian town of Khan Sheikhun in April.

Its impossible to scare North Korea: Putin
	
Vladivostok, Daily Mail), 7 September 2017 - North Korea will never freeze its weapons programmes because it views them as its only means of self defence, according to Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
Speaking on Thursday, Putin said the administration of US President Donald Trump had indicated it wanted to defuse tensions over North Korea. 
His comments followed Washingtons demand of an oil embargo on Pyongyang and a freeze on the foreign assets of its leader Kim Jong-Un in a dramatic bid to force an end to the perilous nuclear stand-off, on Wednesday. 
However, Putin said whipping up military hysteria around the North Korean crisis was counterproductive, adding Pyongyang considered ending its nuclear and missile programmes as suicidal. Its impossible to scare them, Putin said at an economic forum in the far eastern Russian city of Vladivostok.

Lets jam the  brakes on Suicide!
	

A smile, a kind word or gesture costs nothing and doesnt take time. But it would mean the world to a person who is contemplating between giving a final statement to life and giving life another chance. We do come across people who say that they have given up on life and in most instances they become the laughing stock. Unfortunately, that could be a warning sign too. 

Suicide isnt the wish to die, but a final desperate attempt to draw the attention of those around him or her. It doesnt respect class, creed, ethnicity or religion, but would strike anywhere, where the pain of mind exceeds the individuals ability to cope with it. As such, preventing people from making this attempt should beeveryones responsibility. 
Take a Minute, Change a Life - the theme for World Suicide Day which falls Sunday (September 10), reflects on the fact that connections are important at several levels if we are to combat suicide. 
Good relationships among people will reduce chances of depression -Dr.Ramani Ratnaweera
Speaking to The Daily Mirror, Dr.Ramani Ratnaweera, Consultant Psychiatrist at Karapitiya Teaching Hospital said that children between 15-29 are most vulnerable to suicide. This is because they are involved in a competitive education system. Parents are comparing their children with others.
Therefore instead of teaching them to achieve something in life they are being asked to overcome their peers in the classroom. As a result parents continue finding their weaknesses and ridiculing them which will eventually keep their esteem low. Instead of fulfilling their wishes through the child, I believe that parents should guide them through their lives, but this isnt happening. 
Another problem is that the family unit isnt so closely knit anymore. So parents dont have time for their children and others are always on their mobile devices. Because of this reason, those children who are experiencing hormonal changes in life will be attracted by the opposite sex. Once they are isolated at home they will seek the attention of someone else. Once that relationship breaks in most instances there have been attempts at suicide. Apart from that, bullying in schools is a major issue. This is because personalities of children vary and every child has a pre-morbid personality, she explained. 
When asked about the stigma associated with it, Dr. Ratnaweera further said that people dont know that depression is curable. Because of that, the chances of seeking professional help are less than 50%. Some people try to battle it on their own. When the levels of Serotonin and Noradrenaline drop, the patient will have many negative thoughts.

People above 70 years of age have a vulnerability to commit suicide. This is because old age is a phase in life where you have more losses than gains

Hence they will lose their appetite, keep thinking about their problems, move away from people and would want to be in isolation. When these feelings become intense, it will end up in suicide. But if there are healthy relationships among people, suicide rates will drop. Chemical imbalance could be cured by medication and therapy. In addition they will have to go for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and counselling sessions, added Dr. Ratnaweera. 
In a recent finding by Sri Lanka Sumithrayo, it has been identified that people above 70 years of age have a vulnerability to commit suicide. This is because old age is a phase in life where you have more losses than gains. Old people are either alone in their houses or have someone else to look after them, but not their children. This is why they should get involved in active ageing programmes.
Through them they will have friends in those groups and wont feel isolated. Once they have been released of their responsibilities they will feel useless. So they could play a musical instrument, stitch or do other work to keep themselves occupied during the day,she said.
Concluding the interview, Dr.Ratnaweera pointed out that these individuals need someone to talk to. Even if they dont reveal, people close to them have to identify any changes and help them come out of their loneliness. It doesnt have to be a counsellor or professional. If someone is having a problem, call and find out. Take them out for a coffee and give them enough time to talk, cry and let out their negativity, she said.

Psychological Autopsy
Autopsy of a Suicidal Mind (Psychological Autopsy) is a uniquely intensive psychological analysis of a suicidal mind. Interviewing the immediate relatives and friends and analysing these interviews and suicidal notes will give us the opportunity to gain some understanding of the persons intense psychological pain and to examine what may have been done to save the persons tortured life. But the most important aspect is the prevention of suicide. 
Suicide is the result of complex interactions between a range of factors including historical, psychological, cultural, biological and social. Any approach taken to treat the problem of suicide must include considering all these factors. Postmortems of individuals, who died following suicide, reveal that there are chemical changes in the brain mainly in the Serotonergic system in different regions of the grey matter within. 

A befriending service for everyone
Recent findings by Sri Lanka Sumithrayo have revealed that parents have a bigger role to play in the case of teen suicides. A few other important findings areas follows : 
Colombo is the easiest place to stay in Sri Lanka with its advancements in technology and modern communication. But despite this communication people have been isolated. Theres hardly anybody without a smartphone and people are dealing with a communicable device rather than with people. Even if a family goes out for dinner we see that all members of the family are glued to their devices, including the parents. Isolation is becoming quite rampant and therefore it is easy to be depressed. 
If someone has irregular sleeping patterns for about two weeks or more then theres a chance that you may be having depression. Sexual patterns too are an indicator of this condition. Also a person undergoing depression will show an inclination to stay away from people and will lack interest in doing daily activities. There will also be a change in appearance as well and this is quite evident in the stance taken by people. If any of these changes are identified, it is advisable to communicate with this individual and be by their side. With the social stigma revolving around depression and other psychological-related conditions, people wouldnt want to speak about it and that is the danger at hand. But theres absolutely no harm in talking about your worries to another person rather than thinking of giving up on life. 
It is absolutely alright to talk about negative things in life. Depression is a treatable condition if intervened. But if it accumulates, one day that person would end his or her life. Once identified, they can seek professional help, get treatment and go for counselling and therapy. Once the course concludes they can once again function as normal people. It is nothing to be ashamed of. Maybe this also has to do with cultural boundaries and therefore we try to keep our problems to ourselves. 
Parents always have to listen to their children. Treat your children as responsible individuals. Whenever they want to tell you something, please listen. Dont ever ridicule them or neglect their request. If they want to talk to you its a big plus point and encourage them to talk with you more often. This way you would be able to detect any change in their lifestyle at an early stage. Also dont burden them with too much academic work.

Let us resolve to read
	
Most of them usually come, not to purchase or even peruse the books on display
	No nation, and no community, can keep up with modernity unless it gets its people to flip through a page and learn something
	We are a nation of memorisers: we throw out what is taught to us, word to word
Reading is an easy discipline. It requires discipline, yes, but the sort thats tempered less by coercion than by interest, energy, and enthusiasm. In Sri Lanka, September is demarcated as the Literary Month. Thats Sahithye Masaya in Sinhala. Now in a world where mothers, fathers, and children are celebrated on certain days and nearly every animal, from dogs to cats to pigs, have entire years dedicated to them, this isnt cause for wonderment. There are of course many ways of talking about a month. Many ways of talking about the habit of reading. This piece isnt about September or reading, though. Its about a bigger issue. The fact that we dont read enough. 
This piece isnt about September or reading. Its about the fact that we dont read enough 
Three years ago, scanning through various editorials in the Sunday papers (because on Sundays back then, thats what I liked to do), I was entranced by one which delved into an unlikely issue. Back then (September 2014) the Uva Elections had come and gone, Harin Fernando had upset those who had expected the United National Party to lose outright, and Maithripala Sirisena, if we are to believe those whove written on the before and after of the January 8 upheaval, was sketching out his defection (though wed have to wait two months before he walked out). This editorial wasnt bothered about the elections, however, in Uva or elsewhere. Titled (Books Or Noodles) it contended, rather convincingly I should think, that despite the massive crowds which throng at the Colombo International Book Fair (which will be held, this year, from September 15), most of them usually come, not to purchase or even peruse the books on display, but to have the time of their lives, take some pictures, and eat noodles. Interesting. Pertinent. True. And telling. 
Sri Lanka prides on itself as a purveyor of free education. Statistics are quoted, being the dazzling figures that they are, in defence of what commentators feel to be an optimistic future, primarily with respect to our literacy rates. What is often forgotten is that the ability to write your name is less a qualification to be proud of than one which would have got a person to become an incongruous leader: the jack among the illiterates, the sighted among the blind. Thats what happens in Woolfs Village in the Jungle: Babehami, the antagonist, becomes a headman because hes the only man who was taught by a monk to write his own name. Not exactly an achievement, is it 
The Book Fair, and of course the organisers behind it, have done everything to ensure that it tries to achieve its objective: getting more people to read. To be fair, not everyone who visits it does so to have a good time. And to be fair, the Exhibition has grown in popularity over the years, despite those inevitable price hikes. But even with the rising numbers, the indifference to those hikes, and the various events organised at the Fair to inculcate a love for reading (last year, for instance, the Writers Organisation of Sri Lanka held several workshops, while Sampath Bank sponsored a Katapath Pawura to promote Sinhala poetry), the fact is that fewer people, particularly younger people, want to read. Why is this a problem 
Because of the fact that no nation, and no community, can keep up with modernity unless it gets its people to flip through a page and learn something. Not just learn, but comprehend, apply, and if possible, add to. Lets not forget the meaning of literacy as per UNESCO: the ability to identify, understand, interpret, create, communicate, and compute based on printed and written material. We are a nation of memorisers: we throw out what is taught to us, word to word. What makes this even more pathetic, then, is that even within its limited parameters we dont take in enough. Modernity is coterminous with looking to the future by anchoring oneself in the past, by understanding that the past is neither praiseworthy nor blameworthy in its entirety. If we havent learnt to process a text, though, exactly how are we going to do that 
If we dont become a nation of readers we dont and cant become a nation of novelists, poets, critics, and thinkers. Its as easy as that. We grow to simply be content with whats there, available for everyone, preferring ease of access to forward-looking intelligence. Three distinct points, or problems, emerge from this. 
One, we end up becoming a repository, and not a disseminator, of information. Two, we become sterile, content in living for the moment, not processing what is heard and seen everywhere (especially with respect to popular culture, which is so rampant that its influence is widespread, inescapable), and blindly accepting of what is without thinking of what was and will be. Three, and most poignantly, we let go of the need to sustain a national literature, and thereby neglect whats already and historically ours. Of these three the first two have been elaborated by others, while the third has not. I will sweep through the first two, and delve into the third later on. 
The contemporary world is (apparently) divided into two cultures: high and low. This dichotomy, so convenient to some, is actually a farce. A corollary of this is the separation of that same culture into the popular and the serious. That too is a farce, evasive, careless. My contention is that culture is derived from what is seen and heard, and by that I include everything: Amaradeva and Khemadasa played on your radio at home; H. R. Jothipala and Sangeeth Wijesuriya played on the bus on your way home. 
Theres really nothing different between these two categories, come to think of it; if at all, the former is closeted, the domain of those who go for refined tastes, while the latter is the preserve of you and me, middle-of-the-road public transport users. 
But this is irrelevant: one can listen to Khemadasa on the bus and one can listen to Sangeeth Wijesuriya at home. What brings the highbrow and the lowbrow here together is the fact that culture is, at its inception, popular: it is heard, processed, and more often than not sensually felt. And when it is digested, it becomes an influence, shaping ones ideas, tastes, and prejudices. What then tempers popular culture  the cinema, the theatre, music, even pornography  is our ability to process it, to explain what is heard, seen, and felt. To a considerable extent, reading aids this: criticism and judgments are essential in a country where a popular culture exists and is pervasive, and without reading, there can be no judgments, no criticisms, and no criterion of aesthetic and cultural value. In other words, no ascertainable value, period. 
The reason why reading is so important is the reason why criticism is so important: it helps us rationalise our senses, what they feel. One cant rationalise what is felt that easily, of course, and neither should one take this as an excuse to intellectualise emotions (which is what makes so much of contemporary criticism so sterile, so stopgap). Criticism is basically the transformation of felt matter into discerned matter: communicating a culture to its consumers, cogently and cohesively. 
Without reading, without getting in what others have written elsewhere, we cant produce a community of critics. This, and not what puritans and moralists consider as the death knell of our society, is what ails us: our inability to take in and explain. The puritan will argue that it is the profusion of what he considers as a lowbrow culture which has resulted in us not reading, not understanding. My contention is different: I believe that even that which is misconceived by the puritans as lowbrow (H. R. Jothipalas songs, Sunil Soma Peiris movies, Sujeewa Prasannaarachchis novels) can be transformed into deserving art, if one reads into it enough. Without the sort of culture of discernment this necessitates, however, what can we hope for 
Needless to say, one can infer with all this that our growing inability and lack of interest in reading is a corollary of our growing inability at reading between the lines. Without a culture of reading there cant be a culture of writing, to put it simply. 
When I revisit that editorial I read three years ago, therefore, what comes to my mind is that all those noodle-eating folk, who wish to have the time of their lives at an exhibition that is supposed to confer something of value to those who pay the 20 rupee admission and patronise it, are missing the point. By a wide margin. So wide that from those sobering reflections Ive sketched out above, a third comes out: our neglect of our own literature, our own culture. I leave that for a later article, but for now, here are my two cents: without resorting to and nourishing our literature, the written word, we will find it difficult to replenish every other art-form in this country, from drama to music to film. How and why so, I will explore eventually. And soon.

Main Lines on the palm - Line of Life
	
Human Hand  Trailblazer of Human Civilization  Part 24


The Line of Life very often commences at the side of the hand from under the Mount of Jupiter, encircling the Mounts of Lower Mars and Venus. It in most cases, terminates under the Mount of Venus near the bracelets or rascettes.
The location
The renowned palmist Cheiro says: The Line of Life is that line which runs round the base of the thumb and lies directly over a large blood-vessel called the Great Palmer Arch. This blood vessel is more directly with the heart, stomach and vital organs which may have given rise to its term, The Vital as used the ancients.
This Line is referred to as Jeevana Rekha or Ayu Rekha by the Indian palmists.

Significance of the Life Line
The Line of Life is considered the most important line on the palm, because everything in life depends on life.
This line is seen in the hands of practically all human beings.
Line of Life is not alike in all palms. The great palmist known by the pseudonym Psychos says in his book, New Guide to Palmistry: This line is rarely absent; indeed, its total absence would show that the life of the subject was extremely precarious, and the death might come at any moment
The Line of Life in some hands breaks up half-way near the Mount of Venus. Subjects with such short-lines are short-lived. They die early very often due to an accident. This line should be deep and clear of defects and continuous.
The Line of Life indicates the length of life and the health of the subject at various periods in life.
The Line of Life originates and terminates differently in different hands.
Indication of ambition, wealth, fame and success
In certain cases, this line rises from the Mount of Jupiter. A subject with such a Line of Life would be very ambitious; an individual fired with the desire to gain wealth, fame and general success.

Cold-hearted subjects
In certain cases, the line runs closer to the thumb thus reducing the size of the Mount of Venus. Subjects with a line are cold-hearted and unsympathetic. They are capable of committing the most heinous crime without any feeling. Such subjects do not live long.
As a general rule, the longer the Line of Life, the longer the life; the shorter the line the shorter the life.
It has to be remembered that the Line of Life does not indicate the early death or the life alone.

Indicates natural vigour and health
This line mainly indicates the natural vigour and the health of the subject. The Head Line and the Heart Line also carries the death indications.
Before venturing a prediction, the line on both hands should be carefully examined. If the line is deep, well cut, and free from defects, the subject would be strong, vigorous and full of vitality.
If the Life Line and the Head Line join completely under the Mount of Jupiter, the subject is considered fortunate. Such a subject is persevering and methodical in his work.
However, it is inauspicious for a person to have the Life Line, Heart Line and the Head Line originate from the same point. Such a person is destined to become a victim of murder.
If zig-zag lines are visible on the Life Line, the subject would be in poor health.
A triangle between the Life Line and the heart Line indicates a lung disease.
A thin line originating from the Life Line and proceeding towards the Mount of Jupiter indicates that the subject is very ambitious and works hard to fulfill his aspirations.
If there are lines running parallel to the Life Line, the subject is clever and achieves his goals in life due to careful planning and hard work.
An abrupt end of the Life Line indicates unexpected death of the subject.
The character of the Life Line and its indications are as follows:
Short line: Short life
Narrow and thin line: lack of vitality and resistance to disease
A chained, laddered, broad and shallow line: Delicate health
Islands on the line: Periods of delicate health
Commencing from under the Mount of Jupiter: Grand success(To be continued)

Mexico earthquake: Mass evacuations following tsunami warnings
	
Mass evacuations are being carried out following warnings of tsunamis across the region of Mexico, the Guardian reported.
The tsunami warning was issued after the magnitude 8.1 earthquake struck off the coast of Mexico leaving at least five people dead.
Initial waves reached 1 metre above tide level as some residents on the south western coast reportedly told to evacuate.
The quake occurred 165km west of the state of Chiapas just before midnight on Thursday local time, and was said to be the strongest earthquake to hit the country since 1985, according to the civil protection agency.
Three people were confirmed dead in Chiapas, and two in Tabasco state, as the Pacific tsunami warning centre said waves as high as three metres could strike the coast.
The Tabasco governor, Arturo Nez, said the two killed were children. One died after a wall collapsed and the other was a baby who died in a childrens hospital that lost electricity.

Muhurthas for marriage and marital happiness
	


Most people in our country like their compatriots in other countries in the East, believe that success in any important work or event greatly depends on the Muhurtha or the auspicious moment at it is commenced. Panchamga or five cardinal basics and the planetary positions (Tatkaala Kundali) operational at a given moment goes a long way in determining the Muhurtha.


What is Muhurtha 
Panchamga namely Vedic Day, Tithi, Nakshatra, Yoga and Karana are mainly determined on the basis of the movements of the Moon and the Tatkaala Kundali is the celestial map or the positions of the nine planets in the Zodiac at a given moment. Most Sinhalese refer to the astrologically auspicious moment as Muhurtha or Nekata.

Sri Lankans as a nation make it a point to embark on any important activity or launch an important event at an auspicious time or Muhurtha worked out by an astrologer. Of all events in the life of a person, marriage is considered the most important and we are used to arranging all activity connected with the marriage ceremony to take place at an auspicious time or Subha Nekata. 

Tatkaala Kundali or the planetary positions in the Zodiac at a given time is used as the main guide for determining Subha Muhurthas for a marriage ceremony.


Tatkaala Kendra based on the time for tying the nuptial knot
Tatkaala Kendra or the horoscope must be cast based on the time fixed for tying the nuptial knot when the formal union of the bride and the groom takes place on the Poruwa.


Clear 1st House vital
The celebrated Indian Jyotish Guru Dr. B.V. Raman says that in the horoscope cast for the marriage ceremony the Ascendant or the first Bhava should be free from planetary occupation or without any planet posited in it. Mars should not occupy the 8th House and Venus must not be in the 6th House. Jupiter, Venus or mercury should be in a quadrant or a Kendra excepting the 7th House.

According to classical astrological work, Narada Samhita marriage should take place in an auspicious Ascendant and Navamsa Ascendant.


Results of marriage in different Ascendants
According to Kaalaprakashika, a famous work on Muhurthas, marriage would be a success if it takes place in Gemini, Virgo or Libra ascendants.

According to astrological principles given in classical astrological works, if the marriage takes place in the Aries ascendant, bride becomes adulterous; in Taurus, husband loses his job or his business prosperity, in Gemini the bride will bring fortune to her husband and in-laws, in Cancer she becomes unchaste, in Leo she bears only one child, in Virgo she brings fortune to her husband, in Scorpio she becomes unfaithful to her husband, in Sagittarius up to 15 degrees she becomes promiscuous, in Sagittarius from 16 to 30 degrees she becomes divine (highly virtuous woman, in Capricorn she gets involved in extra-marital relationships, in Aquarius she becomes unfaithful to her husband and in Pisces she becomes unchaste.


Results in different Navamsa Ascendants
According to Indian Rishi Vasista marriage Navamsa Ascendant is more powerful than the marriage Ascendant. According to him, if the marriage occurs in Aries Navamsa, the bride develops affection for a person other than her husband. In Taurus Navamsa, she remains emotionally and mentally stable even times of great stress and hardship. Marriage in Gemini Navamsa confers sons and wealth.

Marriage in Cancer makes the bride a person of weak character. Marriage in Leo Navamsa makes her live in parental home away from her husband. Marriage in Virgo Navamsa bestows wealth on her family. In Libra Navamsa she comes into all comforts and luxuries in life. Marriage in Scorpio Navamsa confers virtue and prosperity on the bride. In Sagittarius Navamsa, Ascendant up to 15 degrees she becomes wealthy and from 16 to 30 degrees she becomes adulterous. Capricorn Navamsa Ascendant deprives her of chastity and wealth. Aquarius Navamsa keeps her away from husband and in-laws. Marriage in Pisces Navamsa brings her fortune, but she becomes unfaithful to her husband.

Myth: Green tea can affect a womans menstrual cycle 
Busted: The menstrual cycle is mainly dependant on the hypothalamus pituitary axis and the ovarian axis. So green tea doesnt really have an effect on the menstruation. I dont think there are any links between the two. Food and drinks dont really affect the menstruation. In the sense if a woman is putting on weight due to a fatty diet, then the obesity is the factor that can affect the menstrual cycle. An irregular menstrual cycle can be caused by an obese patient taking a high calorie diet, with more fat and sugar. In addition to this there is a risk of proliferation of the lining of the womb which can lead to irregular menstruation and later on cancer, said Dr. U.D.P Rathnasiri, Consultant Obstetrician/Gynaecologist, Castle Street Hospital.

Numbers that shape your destiny from 21 to 30
	
We hope that our regular readers may remember that we explained the significance of the Basic Numbers from 1 to 20 in two previous articles.
We also explained the qualities each Basic Number from 1 to 20 represents and their affinity to each other.
Now we are to discuss the significance of numbers beyond 20 in relation to their numerical and vibrational value which we have already discussed.
We have already explained to you that if the numerical value of your name corresponds to a number which is not favourable, you can change its numerical value to a value that is favourable to you by modifying the spelling of the name by adding or removing an innocuous letter.
You can seek the guidance from the potentialities ascribed to numbers beyond 20 as given below:
Number 21: This number signifies progress and success. The subject has to strive hard- go through the mill, so to speak, to achieve success in life.
Number 22: This number represents illusion, passivity and inactivity. Many plans are made, but they are not translated into action. As a result, no tangible result is achieved.
Number 23: This number holds out success thanks to patronage from those holding high office. 
Number 24: This number too holds out fulfillment of aspirations. With help from persons holding high positions and also from members of the opposite sex.
Number 25: This number indicates achievements gained through struggle and experience and trial and error method. The part of life is a period of struggle and hardship. The efforts pay dividends during the latter of life.
Number 26: This number issues a warning about the possibility of losing wealth and position due to bad company. Married life and business partnerships go on the rocks. The number indicates risks and ruins round the corner.
Number 27: This number signifies initiative and authority. The subject is intelligent and endowed with creative powers as well as the capacity to execute his own plans. He would succeed in all his endeavors.
Number 28: This indicates initial success and subsequent failure and frustration, litigation, legal problems and obstructions to the implementation of plans. Misplaced trust would lead to financial failure.
Number 29: This number heralds a trend of unexpected unfavorable turns and twists. The trust placed in unworthy associates and members of the opposite sex would lead to unfavorable changes, trials and setbacks.
Number 30: This is a mental number. The subject would achieve intellectual heights, but he would be devoid of material success.

Republican leaders shell-shocked as Trump cuts deal with Democrats
	

By James Hohmann  
(c) 2017, The Washington Post  Sep 07, 2017 -  In early 2016, as the field of Republican candidates winnowed, Bob Dole said that Donald Trump was preferable to Ted Cruz because he could probably work with Congress. 
Wednesday, President Trump cut his first big deal with congressional leaders Pelosi and Schumer. Snubbing Republican leaders and his own Treasury secretary, he agreed with Pelosi and Schumer on plans for a three-month bill to fund the government and raise the debt ceiling for the same amount of time. 
The president also signaled support for a Democratic push to pass legislation that would shield undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children from deportation. Chuck and Nancy want to see something happen - and so do I, Trump said. 
Then he flew to North Dakota on Air Force One with Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, declared he really wants to work with her on overhauling the tax code and called her a good woman. 
As some Trump advisers signaled that this is a sign of whats to come, Republican leaders on Capitol Hill seethed with anger about all three of these developments. Veteran negotiators in Trumps adopted party think the freshman president agreed to a bad deal that gives Pelosi and Schumer more leverage. They feel like theyre being boxed in on immigration and being set up as fall guys. And they resent that Trump just gave meaningful air cover to one of the most beatable Democrats in 2018. 
Trump called it a very good deal.

Shedding light on Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
	

This week the Health Capsule has made arrangements to take the readers through a somewhat shady topic related to the female reproductive tract. We call it shady because Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) may go untreated for years. This is because the symptoms are generalized and in many cases, mild. But the repercussions of PID are severe, being a leading causative factor for sub fertility as well as ectopic pregnancies. 
The female reproductive system consists of upper and lower parts. The lower reproductive tract includes the external genitalia, called the vulva, the vagina and the cervix, the tube-like structure that connects the vagina with the uterus. Upper female genital tract comprises the uterus; the sac that holds a fetus, ovaries, and the fallopian tubes which carry the ovum released by ovaries to the uterus. PID is the inflammation of the female reproductive organs due to infective organisms spreading upwards through cervix, uterus, fallopian tubesand ovaries. 
PID is generally transmitted sexually, with Chlamydia and gonorrhea infections being the commonest. The prevalence of the disease is high amoung young, sexually active women, women with multiple sexual partners and women in a sexual relationship with a person who has more than one sexual partner. 
In addition, women who have undergone childbirth or miscarriage are also more susceptible to PID. The entrance to the cervix from the vagina is usually closed with a ring of tissues which prevents pathogenic organisms from travelling upwards. This barrier opens up during child birth to let the fetus come out and the infective organisms can travel up through the cervix into the uterus, spreading the infection upwards. 

Symptoms 
Presentation of the disease varies from each woman. Some have severe symptoms while the majority has mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. The commonest symptoms are lower abdominal pain and/or tenderness. Pain during sexual intercourse, pain when passing urine and difficulty in passing urine, foul vaginal discharge can also be present. Unusual vaginal bleeding including bleeding between two periods, and heavy menstrual bleeding can also occur. 
Symptoms presenting outside of the reproductive system includes nausea, vomiting and fever. 

Complications 
PID, when untreated, is a principle cause of infertility and sub-fertility in women. The infection, when persistent, disturbs the surface of the tract, causing the formation of adhesions or strictures, obstructing the tract. PID can also increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy, meaning that the fetus is implanted in a site outside of the uterus. The fetus is almost always unviable and in case of tubal ectopic pregnancy, where the fetus is implanted in the narrow fallopian tubes, the tube can rupture with the growth of the fetus. This condition may be fatal to the mother as well. 
Abscess formation or formation of pockets full of pus in the tract can also be present. If these pockets burst, releasing its content to the outside abdominal cavity, it may lead to a serious condition called peritonitis or the inflammation of the abdominal coverings. 
PID may also give rise to chronic pelvic pain in some women. These symptoms may be worse during the end of a menstrual period and the few days following the period. 

Diagnosis and treatment 
Diagnosis is done after extensive history-taking and examination. Investigations like blood tests, ultra-sound scan and laparoscopy will also aid in coming to a diagnosis. 
PID can be caused by various and sometimes more than one pathogen. Therefore your doctor will prescribe you with antibiotics with a broad coverage for pathogens. You may start feeling better after two or three days of treatment, but its crucial that you finish the course of antibiotic because theres a high chance of recurrence otherwise. Severe disease may rarely
require hospitalization. 

Prevention 
Practicing safe sexual intercourse is crucial in preventing PID, the ideal situation being both partners being exclusive. 
Using of condoms when practicing unsafe sex will reduce the risk of having PID. If you think you are at risk for PID, get tested regularly so the disease can be diagnosed early, preventing further complications. 
If you are diagnosed as having PID, ask your partner to get screened, since re-infection can occur from the partner after being cured. 
Practicing hygienic methods will also reduce your chances of getting PID. 
Seek immediate medical care if you have these symptoms: 
Severe abdominal pain 
	Persistent high fever 
	Severe nausea and vomiting 
Most women are unaware about PID, since this condition typically doesnt have severe symptoms and is usually non fatal. But the high prevalence of long term complications associated with the disease proves that the public should be made aware on PID and its impact, which will have a significant influence in the quality of life in women.

SL navy ships in India for bilateral naval exercise
	
Sri Lankan naval ships Sayura and Sagara entered Visakhapatnam harbour on Thursday to participate in the fifth edition of SLINEX 2017, a bilateral naval exercise between India and Sri Lanka, from September 7 to 14.
The exercise will be conducted in two phases, with the harbour phase from September 7 to 10 at Visakhapatnam and the sea phase that will be from September 11 to 14 in the Bay of Bengal.
The two Sri Lankan naval ships Sayura and Sagara are Indian built Off-shore Patrol Vessels.
From the Inian side, INS Gharial, an amphibious ship, INS Kora, a missile corvette and Chetak helicopter will be participating in the war games on behalf of the Eastern Fleet.
The exercise will commence with a harbour phase during which the participating navies will engage in professional, cultural and social interactions.
The harbour phase will be followed by the sea phase which will commence on September 11.
The sea phase will include complex operations including anti-piracy exercises, gun firings, cross-deck helicopter operations and anti-surface exercises.
SLINEX series of bilateral maritime exercises were initiated in 2005. Over the years they have helped the two navies to understand each other's procedures and enhance inter-operability.
The benefits of operational interactions under the aegis of SLINEX are clearly visible as both the navies today have an improved and steadfast understanding. SLINEX 17 will further enhance the capability of the two navies to work together at sea and contribute towards maritime security in the region. (Deccan Chronicle)

SL should take concrete steps towards reform objectives: US
	
The Government should take concrete steps towards its Constitutional, Legislative and Security sector reform objectives, US Acting Assistant Secretary of State Alice Wells said on Thursday.
In her speech Maintaining US Influence in South Asia: Fiscal Year 2018 Budget, before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Ms. Wells said the coalition Governments commitment to a reform agenda had prompted growing interest in expanding engagement with the US, including military-to-military relations.
All along, however, we have recognised the need for Sri Lanka to take concrete steps toward its reform objectives. In accordance with limits set by the Congress, our modest military-to-military engagement has therefore expanded slowly and incrementally, she said.
She said the two countries were working together to fulfill the steps to which the two nations agreed in the UNHRC resolution on Sri Lanka.
These resolutions committed the Sri Lankan government to transitional justice and prevention of the recurrence of the violence and abuses experienced during the nations 26-year conflict through constitutional, legislative, and security sector reforms.
Specific steps include constitutional reform devolving more administrative power from the central government to Sri Lankas regions, the replacement of the PTA with a law that meets international standards of fairness and due process, the return of land seized by the military during the war, and the establishment of transitional justice mechanisms such as the Office of Missing Persons (OMP), a truth and reconciliation commission, an office for reparations and a credible mechanism to investigate and prosecute alleged war crimes. The United Nations will continue its oversight of the implementation of these steps through March 2019, Ms.Wells said.
She said the US FY2018 budget request of $3.4 million in foreign assistance focuses on strong support for security cooperation and enhanced strategic trade controls, while contributing to Sri Lankas progress toward becoming a mine-impact-free nation by 2020.
Additionally, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is developing a compact with Sri Lanka after it successfully passed the MCC policy scorecard in 2016. In June, MCC approved an initial $7.4 million to study potential projects and conduct due diligence work in the transport and land sectors. MCC is working closely with the Government of Sri Lanka to bring a compact for Board approval in 2018, Ms. Wells concluded.

Spinal Problems
	
Interbody fusion is a spinal procedure recommended for patients who suffer from degenerated discs or other conditions where the spine is moving. Patient benefits include a lower risk of affecting other parts of the body, and also a lower risk of infection due to a smaller cut
Simply put, degenerative disc condition describes the symptoms of radiating weakness or numbness, or pain stemming from a degenerated disc in the spine. Disc degeneration is a natural part of aging, and over time everyone will exhibit a greater or lesser degree of degeneration of their spinal discs. 
However, not all people will develop symptoms. In fact, degenerative disc disease is quite variable in its nature and severity. While the definition sounds simple, many patients diagnosed with degenerative disc disease are left wondering exactlywhat this diagnosis means for them. 

Definition
Interbody fusion is the process where the disc between 2 vertebral bodies is removed and replaced with a cage filled with bone graft allowing the bones to fuse to each other, says Dr Benjamin Tow, an orthopaedic surgeon at Mount Elizabeth Hospital , Singapore. It is widely used when there is a need to stabilise the spinal segment, which may be part of deformity correction, nerve root decompression or restoration of the space for the spinal nerves to exit. 
Older forms of spinal fusion involve using screws to connect two vertebrae, which may compromise or affect the alignment of the spine due to loss of disc height. 
Interbody fusion allows proper alignment of the spine as the cage keeps the disc height the same. Having a bone graft will also mean that the post - fusion vertebrae will be
more stable. 
Originally, interbody fusion was traditionally performed as an open surgery from the back and the abdomen. Known as Anterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion, there are risks as the surgeon will have to take nearby critical organs, arteries and muscle into consideration. These days, interbody fusion can be performed in a minimally invasive manner at lowerrisks to the patient. 
Extreme Lateral Interbody Fusion, or XLIF, is a minimally invasive form of interbody fusion that is performed through the side of the back as opposed to the front or the back. In XLIF, a probe is inserted from the side of the back, avoiding the nerves and muscles. The probe is then used to remove the disc and insert the implant. 
Minimally invasive fusion requires a smaller incision and causes less tissue disruption with less bleeding, says Dr Tow. This translates to less pain, faster recovery, and less risk
of infection. 

How long does it take to recover 
Generally, patients who undergo minimally invasive interbody fusion will only require 1 or 2 days of hospitalisation before returning home. In short segment fusions, the patient can return to activities such as jogging, swimming and light gaming sports, Dr Tow says. There may be aches and pains for the first few months before the fusion becomes fully established, he explains, but bending over or lifting heaving things should still be avoided until the fusion is fully established, which takes
around 3 months. 
There are different approaches to interbody fusion depending on the patients condition, not all patients are suitable for minimally invasive procedures. While the benefits of minimally invasive surgeries can be attractive, the fact remains that the most suitable procedure for your condition is something that only your orthopaedic surgeon can determine. For example, people with severe spinal misalignment problems might not be able to go through XLIF as it might be difficult  to access the disc fromthe side.

Theresa Mays DUP ally accused over trips to Sri Lanka
	
AnorthernIrishMP propping up the government accepted luxury holidays worth 100,000 from Sri Lanka without telling Parliamentary watchdogs, it was reported.
Ian Paisley Jr, of the Democratic Unionist Party, accepted two all-expenses trips from the state.
Mr Paisley, his wife and four kids flew business class, were ferried around in a chauffeur-driven Mercedes and stayed in posh hotels.
In exchange he offered the Sri Lankans help brokering an oil deal, saying he had significant arrangements with national oil suppliers in Oman and Nigeria.
He went on the 2013 jaunts without declaring them in the Commons register of interests, according to The Telegraph.
MPs are obliged to declare income, gifts or affiliations that could spark a conflict of interest in their parliamentary roles.
This week Mr Paisley posted a picture of himself alongside Sri Lankan high commissioner Amari Wijewardene outside the Houses of Parliament.
Mr Paisley is one of 10 DUP MPs relied on by Theresa May to keep her government functioning properly. (thesun.co.uk)

UNP must decide whether SF is fit to be a minister: Elle Gunawansa Thera
	
The Ven. Elle Gunawansa Thera, in response to a statement by Minister and Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka describing the monk as a 'mad man in robes' said yesterday the United National Party (UNP) should decide whether it should have such a person as a Cabinet minister any longer.
The monk said senior UNPers such as Gamini Dissanayake, Lalith Athulathmudali and R. Premadasa had visited his temple on several occasions.
Mr. Fonseka is a political reject. Only the UNP accommodated him and gave him a portfolio. The UNP should now decide whether it should risk its credibility by having such a person in the Cabinet. However, the people will decide, he said.
In a way, slandering me has turned out to be a blessing in guise. I was able to realize the magnitude of affection people have towards me. Throngs of people from all walks of life are visiting me. All the former army commanders frequented my temple. Mr. Fonseka's claim that war crimes took place has become a reason for jubilation by pro-LTTE groups operating overseas, the monk said.
He said Mr. Fonseka's harsh attitude towards him had forced him to appear on the political stage for the first time.
So, far I have not stepped on anyone's political stage but I will do it for the time when the occasion arises, he said. (Kelum Bandara)

US Embassy conducts English scholarship programme
	
September 8 is International Literacy Day, an opportunity to celebrate the achievements of over 1,000 young Sri Lankans who have participated in the U.S. Embassys English Access scholarship programme, along with more than 1,300 English teachers who have taken part in on-line training. English language ability opens doors to the wider world, better economic and academic opportunities and can serve as a bridge language in multilingual Sri Lanka.
 
Learning a new language is challenging, but these future leaders have learnt English while developing their critical and creative thinking skills, mastering formal debating and gaining confidence in public speaking. Its not just about reaching one class or ethnic group. Its about bringing young people together in a funfiled, but challenging programme that pushes them to work harder and dream bigger. Girls and boys between 13 and 16 are equally represented and are drawn from all local religions and ethnicities. Students apply through a competitive process, including a placement test, school administrators approval, and evidence of financial need. 
Access students attend after-school classes and an intensive one-week summer camp. The curriculum highlights equality, democratic values, and respect for the environment. Access takes students beyond rote learning and grammar exercises with an emphasis on speaking and using the language. 

The Access programme also contains a community development component, helping to build future leaders and nurture a sense of responsibility, volunteerism, teamwork, and civic engagement. For many students, this is their first opportunity to assist those in need and co-operate to find solutions within their own communities. Many students have commented that not only did they enjoy the classwork, but they took their coursework home and shared it with family and friends, teaching others what they had learnt. 

Launched in Sri Lanka in 2006, Access boasts of more than 900 alumni, with 366 students currently enrolled in classes across the country
The heart and soul of Access, as in any outstanding classroom, are the teachers. Access teachers have completed specialized trainings in Sri Lanka and abroad. They have brought Access to Aluthgama, Galle, Jaffna, Trincomalee, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Banderawela, Belihuloya, and Kandy. All Access teachers have received over 36 hours of residential training by language experts and experienced professors with additional coursework available online to enhance their techniques in teaching. The U.S. Department of State has brought many of them to the United States, Nepal, and India to build international and regional ties. In addition, visiting English Language Fellows offer support and provide individual expertise on American teaching methodology and pedagogy to Access teachers and students during their tenure in Sri Lanka.

Launched in Sri Lanka in 2006, Access boasts of more than 900 alumni, with 366 students currently enrolled in classes across the country. These young learners are part of a global community of almost 100,000 Access students in more than 85 countries who have benefited from the U.S. Governments commitment to youth literacy and empowerment. With solid programmes like Access, and others like the Fulbright graduate scholarship programme and the Global UGRAD undergraduate programme, Im proud of the investment we have made in the future leaders of this great country.

Why pain is an important indicator
	

What if I told you that pain keeps us alive Literally I remember, at the age of three or four years, being fascinated by the the chimney lamp that lighted our house during power cuts. The flame was yellow and moved and it was so beautiful. I always tried to touch it. After saying no so many times, and knowing my stubborn nature, one night my parents didnt object when I reached for the outer covering. Even though it had been lighted a few minutes earlier, it was still hot, and painful when I touched it. That pain taught me a lesson that my parents couldnt teach me. That experience has made me be careful ever since when dealing with fire. 
So, that is the effect of pain. Imagine yourself stepping on a thorn. The pain makes you withdraw your foot, avoiding further injury. You fall down and fracture your ankle. Would you actually bother to seek immediate medical care if not for the severe pain 

Pain isnt always a good thing. In long term conditions like arthritis or nerve damage, people experience chronic severe pain, that may not even respond to medication

How does pain originate There are thousands of nerve endings under the superficial skin coverings that will be stimulated by pain. This helps to take the message of pain to your brain. So, technically, you feel pain in your brain, and not in the part that is hurt. Isnt that fascinating 
Imagine banging your toe on a random object lying around. What will you feel Am I correct in assuming that youll feel a sharp stabbing pain, followed by a more diffuse, lingering, achy type of pain That is because there are two varieties of nerves carrying messages regarding pain to the brain. The first one, called A delta fiber, carries the message faster, via the highway, while the other, called the C fiber, carries it through the normal route with its share of traffic. 
What we perceive as pain actually originates through a variety of ways and means. Pain can be initiated due to excessive pressure, as is the case of being hit by a stick. It could be stimulated by extreme heat or even cold. Dont believe me Try submerging your hand in ice cold water for a few seconds! Also remember the time that you ate that hot kochchi lunumiris with your bare hands and had to blow on your fingers for hours to make the burning sensation vanish Thats an example of chemical irritants causing you pain. 
Pain can be divided in other ways too. There is a clear difference of the pain from a superficial wound on the outside of the body and pain from an abdominal cramp, aka, inside pain. Outside pain, also called the somatic pain, is sharper, while inside pain is duller and associated with other symptoms like sweating and nausea. Want to know another curious fact Your brain cant feel pain. There are times when your head hurts so much that you think it is probably your brain hurting You guessed wrong. The outer coverings of the brain can sense pain though, and in the case of a big tumor or a swelling of the brain (causing stretching of the coverings) can actually cause a headache. 
Pain isnt always a good thing. In long term conditions like arthritis or nerve damage, people experience chronic severe pain, that may not even respond to medication. 
Heard enough about pain Did you know that there is a condition called congenital analgesia, where a person has never felt pain in his life Now ask yourself the question again. Is lack of pain a good thing or a bad thing  Good luck figuring it out!

Will quit Govt: Some SLFP ministers, MPs tell President
	
A group of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) MPs are reported to have informed President Maithripala Sirisena on Wednesday night that they would quit the government soon and yesterday met former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to discuss the next step.
The group included Ministers Susil Premajayantha and Anura Priyadarshana Yapa and Deputy Ministers T.B. Ekanayake, Dulip Wijesekara, Nimal Lansa and Arundika Fernando. According to Reports at least 12 SLFP MPs in the government are likely to cross over.
They had the President after the late night Central Committee meeting on Wednesday. These ministers were reported to have said they found it increasingly difficult to be in the government amid corruption allegations such as the bond scam and questionable highway projects and criticised the governments move towards power devolution.
Meanwhile, Deputy Minister Arundika Fernando and former President Chandrika Kumaratunga had reportedly crossed words at the Central Committee meeting with the deputy minister alleging that some UNP members were involved in fraud and corruption while Ms. Kumaratunga said the current government took office after ending a term riddled with rampant fraud and corruption.
