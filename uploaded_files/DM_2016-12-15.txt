Afghan kids out of school risk early marriage, child labour
	
KABUL, Afghanistan (AP/Daily Mail) /14 December 2016- Children of Afghan families returning from Pakistan who dont go to school and have no access to education are increasingly at risk of early marriage and child labour, according to a survey releasedon Wednesday. 
The survey by Save the Children reveals an alarming crisis in Afghanistans eastern Nangarhar province where the polling took place among returnees from Pakistan. It warns the situation could deteriorate further as more than 3,500 Afghans return from Pakistan on a daily basis after Islamabad tightened regulations on those living illegally in the country. 
So far this year, more than 650,000 Afghans have returned from Pakistan, with the majority planning to stay in Nangarhar, at least until the end of winter. Hundreds of thousands more Afghans are expected to be repatriated in the coming months. 
The survey is based on 379 interviewees conducted by Save the Children between Oct. 28 and Nov. 8 in five districts in Nangarhar. The poll gave a 5 percent margin of error.

Afghan vice president accused of sexually assaulting rival
	
KABUL AFP/ Dec 13, 2016- 
Allegations that Afghanistans first vice president and his guards sexually assaulted a political rival while holding him captive in his private compound prompted calls on Tuesday from the countrys Western allies for a government investigation. Abdul Rashid Dostum, a former warlord who has a catalogue of war crimes attached to his name, is accused of ordering his guards to seize Ahmad Ishchi last month in northern Jowzjan province during a game of buzkashi, or polo with a carcass.
 Dostum allegedly kept Ishchi hostage in his private enclave for five days, where he was said to be tortured and sodomised.  But the United States joined a slew of Western governments to call for a thorough probe.

Can  Aging be delayed Preventing Premature Aging
	

Aging has been invariably associated with being disabled and falling ill. Though aging is an inevitable stage of life, the elderly can lead a healthy and active life through a healthy diet and regular exercise.Views on aging have evolved over the years and experts point out that even the young could age. In an engaging interview with the Daily Mirror, Dr. N. Kumaranayake, Clinical Psychiatrist of the Kiribathgoda Base Hospital illustrated the scientific basis behind this claim and suggested methods to prevent premature aging. 
Scientists have pointed out that chronological age is not accurate. A person can have a psychological age that exceeds their chronological age. They can feel mature or younger than they really are, Dr. Kumaranayake remarked. Chronological age is the number of years a person has lived. Psychological age refers to how old a person feels, acts and behaves. Hence Dr. Kumaranayake asserts they are not necessarily equal. Accordingly, when a person has aged psychologically he is more susceptible to falling ill. 

MODERN DISCOVERIES
Free Radical Theory
Among many theories proposed on the subject of aging, Dr. Kumaranayake elaborated on two theories. Termed the Free Radical Theory of aging Dr. Kumaranayake said free radicals resulted in a person falling ill. Oxygen is both a blessing and a curse. Human beings need oxygen to live. Yet a simple act of breathing oxygen results in the formation of a highly reactive molecule called free radicals, he said. 
As free radicals interact with other molecules in the body, it causes oxidative damage. This damages the organs and results in a wide range of illnesses and diseases, he added. 
He further said free radical formation was high in people inhabiting polluted environments, indulged in smoking and eating unhealthy food. People take anti-oxidants to prevent free radical damage, he noted. 
Telomeres theory
Referring to the latest research which is called the telomeres theory, he said, At the end of each chromosome there is a cap just like in a shoe lace. This cap prevents the lace from loosening. Likewise telomeres (which are at the end of chromosomes) also have a cap which protects the chromosome. It was Nobel Laureate Prof. Elizabeth Blackburn who extensively studied the telomeres. 
Adding that genetic material is hidden in our chromosomes, he said that to a certain extent, genes concealed whether you would be a diabetic, a heart patient or a rheumatoid arthritic. This genetic material doesnt come out because telomeres keep them within the chromosome. But when the telomeres are damaged, the genetic material inside the chromosome comes out. They cause illnesses like heart diseases and diabetes. This is premature aging, he noted. 

Citing an example he said Suppose your genetics inflict a particular disease when youre 60 years old. But as your telomeres are damaged you would contract it at 30. 
Referring to instances when telomeres could be loosened he said, Telomeres get shorter naturally. But environmental factors can damage it as well. They are damaged when a person is stressed out. 
Recounting an encounter with one of his patients who was suffering from premature aging, Dr. Kumaranayake said, A 45-year-old manager of a company complained that he was suffering from constant headaches, backaches, feelings of irritability and anger. He is a very hard worker pursuing a degree as well. Recently he also found that his diabetic level was in the level of impairment. But he had no record of a family history of cardiovascular diseases or diabetes. 
Applying the telomeres concept, he said the manager was suffering from premature aging. Scientists have found that chronic stress increases the risk of contracting cardio-vascular diseases and can even shorten ones lifespan, he stressed. 
He further asserted that psychological aging has been linked with higher oxidative stress and shorter telomere length. 
A Study has proven that a stressful life style can make you 10 years older than you really are, he said. 

PREVENTING PREMATURE AGING
Discussing ways to prevent premature aging, Dr. Kumaranayake suggested that exercising daily neutralized stress-induced rapid aging. 
Vitamin D affects telomeres. Studies indicate that restoring low vitamin D levels to normal slows down genetic-related aging. High serum vitamin D concentration is linked with longer telomeres. This is equal to years of additional lifespan, he explained.  Low levels of vitamin D are associated with many age-related diseases such as cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, osteoporosis and strokes. Vitamin D can be obtained easily through a nutritional supplement with the advice of a doctor, he said.
He noted that Prof. Blackburns research demonstrated how the individual with abundant Omega 3 in his blood had a 20% reduction in the rate of telomere loss compared to those with low levels of Omega 3 in their blood. This shows that Omega 3 delays genetic aging, he noted. 
According to her study, a daily Omega 3 supplement lengthened telomeres. An intake of 1000-2500mg a day of Omega 3 fats is sufficient to prevent you from premature aging. This improves longevity and prevents age-related diseases like Alzheimers, he said. 
He further pointed out that this discovery coincided with the findings of the American Heart Association which recommends 1000mg a day of Omega fatty acids for the prevention of heart attacks and strokes. 

LIFE EXPECTANCY INSRI LANKA
According to the Department of Census and Statistics, there is an increase in life expectancy for both males and females in Sri Lanka. World Health Organization reports published in 2015 show that the life expectancy of males was at 71.6. The average life expectancy for females is 78.3 years. Accordingly, Sri Lanka has been ranked 67th in the world ranking of life expectancy.

80,000 children will starve to death in Nigeria:UNICEF
	
A doctor feeds a malnourished child at a feeding centre run by Doctors Without Borders in Maiduguri, Nigeria. 


LAGOS, Nigeria (AP/Daily Mail)/14 December 2016 
Nearly half a million children will face starvation in northeastern Nigeria next year and 80,000 will die if they dont get treatment in the humanitarian crisis created by Boko Harams Islamic uprising, the U.N. Childrens Agency warned on Tuesday. 
What is already a crisis can become a catastrophe, UNICEF executive director Anthony Lake said. 
His statement said the 400,000 children at risk of starvation represent just a fraction of the suffering among some 2.6 million refugees in the seven-year insurgency that has killed more than
20,000 people. 
If they do not receive the treatment they need, one in five of these children will die,
Lake said. 
Large areas of Borno state are completely inaccessible to any kind of humanitarian assistance. We are extremely concerned about the children trapped in these areas, he added. 
Boko Haram attacked a military-escorted humanitarian convoy in July about 70 kilometres (45 miles) from Maiduguri, the birthplace of the insurgency, wounding a UNICEF worker, two other aid workers and two soldiers. 
A rocket-propelled grenade slammed into the windshield of a bullet-proof vehicle, one that Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari has accused the agency of buying instead of spending money on people in need. UNICEF said the vehicle was a donation. 
Lake spoke just days after Buhari accused the U.N. and private international aid agencies of exaggerating the crisis to seek donations. Buhari declared that Boko Haram was technically defeated a year ago and appeared fixed on maintaining that fiction. 

While soldiers from a multinational force of Nigeria and neighbouring countries have pushed the extremists out of towns and many villages they occupied, attacks on military outposts and suicide bombings of soft targets continue.

China Merchant Company will absorb H'tota workers: PM
	
The China Merchant Company will absorb all workers of the Hambantota Port after the take over on January 7 next year, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.
He told media that the Chinese company will absorb the workers under the existing conditions but would sign a fresh agreement with the workers later.
Referring to the recent drama in the Port, the Prime Minister said two companies had informed him that they needed to get their ships released from the port.
Two companies informed me that their ships were in danger and wanted them out of the port. We have to safeguard the few ships that come to the Hambantota Port. Then we need to develop it into a profit making venture. Therefore I informed President Maithripala Sirisena and the Defence Ministry Secretary about it and we decided to send the Navy Commander to release the ships, he said. There are international agreements on safeguarding the ships that come into ports. The International Maritime Organization says international ships need facilities in the ports and security should be strengthened and as such we informed the Navy Commander to take steps to provide security to the ships."
The Prime Minister said the K-line Shipping had asked for US$ 4 million as damages. "Who is going to pay these damages, he asked and said other shipping lines might also claim damages.
The Prime Minister said the Government would set up a permanent navy camp near the Hambantota Port.
It is essential especially after the construction of oil bunkering, refinery and ship building facilities are set up in the area, he said and added that a journalist who was allegedly assaulted had complained to the Tangalle Police whereas he should have complained to the Hambantota Police because the Port comes under their purview.
The Prime Minister said investigations would be conducted to ascertain whether this journalist had entered the high security zone without permission.(Yohan Perera)

Deadly clashes hit Aleppo  as evacuation deal on hold
	
A deal to evacuate civilians and fighters from remaining rebel-held areas of Aleppo is on hold 

ALEPPO AFP/ Dec14, 2016- 
Deadly clashes erupted in Syrias Aleppo on Wednesday and a deal for the evacuation of rebel areas was on hold, leaving thousands of cold and hungry civilians uncertain of their future. 
Entire families had gathered in the early hours, in the hope of leaving Aleppo after an agreement announced the night before for rebels to withdraw from the city. 
But the first expected departures around 5:00 am (0300 GMT) were delayed and, a few hours later, fierce fighting again began to shake the city. 
The landmark deal -- which would mark the end of opposition resistance in Syrias second city after years of fighting -- appeared increasingly precarious as the regime, the rebels, and their foreign allies traded accusations. 
The last pocket of rebel-held territory in east Aleppo came under heavy tank fire, said an AFP correspondent in the area, who saw several wounded civilians. 
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said air strikes had also hit rebel areas and that there were very intense clashes on every front line. 
State television said rebel rocket fire on government-controlled areas had also resumed, with at least seven people reported dead. 
Rebels and a source close to the regime told AFP that the evacuation had been suspended after objections from Syrias government. 
The source said Damascus had baulked when the rebels wanted to increase the number of those to be evacuated from 2,000 to 10,000.

Dont see MR making a comeback: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in a recent interview with The Hindu had said people would realise, as new policies succeed, that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was a failure and that he couldnt see Rajapaksa making a comeback.
When asked whether he was concerned over the possibility of Mahinda Rajapaksas comeback, the Prime Minister said Mahinda Rajapaksa couldnt afford to be out of the SLFP and he would lose his base and the party could take disciplinary action.
In my view, as time goes on he will lose the base support he has, because times are changing and the younger voters are not with him.
So, if they miss out on the younger voters, there will be other parties who will try to cater to them. As our policies succeed, people will realise that Mahinda Rajapaksa was a failure. I cant see a comeback by him, because when people make a change they never go back to the status quo.
If they want to make another change, they will look at something new. But I dont think that will happen because people like the idea of the two main parties working together.
They want to see the delivery taking place, thats what we are focusing on. Once the delivery is assured, it will cease to be a major problem. Till then youve got to live with a thorn on your side, and I think our political parties are capable of doing that, Premier Wickremesinghe said.
The Premiers full interview with The Hindu
Q: Prime Minister, the overall political situation in Sri Lanka seems to have stabilized after the big change in 2015, the election of Maithripala Sirisena as President followed by your victory in the parliamentary elections. How do you see this process, which has seen improvement as well as complications
With the parliamentary elections in August 2015, we created the National Government. And we gave it a period for it to stabilize. I think that has taken place now. We also prepared a new policy framework. We had incurred a heavy national debt, there was adverse publicity for Sri Lanka, and human rights were a big issue  all those have been resolved.
I would say we have sort of created the stability and cleared the way. Now, next year is when we have to deliver on our promises, which will also help us to consolidate this arrangement. We have started the journey, it has been slow going. It would be, if the two major parties have to get together. Its a tremendous task. Still havent got the two major parties to get together in India or anywhere else. But it has worked out well here. Now it is a question of delivery and consolidation. We are moving on different fronts. We are looking at reconciliation, looking at the crisis in the North  both the human problems and the economic problems, the development. The President is now focusing on the rural poor. We are discussing a new Constitution. I would say that the next two years are important for us to consolidate the gains we have made.
Q: How is the economy doing What has happened, is it a gain
It is a gain. We have undertaken a macroeconomic stabilisationprogramme. And we are moving our revenue collection, which was about 10-11 per cent of GDP. Hopefully we will be at 15 per cent when our term is over and then we can move towards a higher level. Ours is also an exercise in how do you bring the black money in; and we are trying to phase out the long tax holidays that have been granted. We want to bring the budget deficit down to about 4 per cent by 2020  and thats the process. Its now more a question of revenue collection and better management of the public funds.
We have strengthened Parliament  by allowing it to have the [sectoral] oversight committees; we have established the Public Finance Committee; we will bring legislation for the Parliamentary Budget Office; and the present J.R Jayewardene Centre may be used for parliamentary research, very much like the unit you have in New Delhi or the institute that is available in Islamabad.
Q: What are the challenges on the economic front
Growth. How do you go up to 7 per cent growth Getting the investments in.Creating more employment. Increasing incomes and then reviving the rural economy. Im confident we can do it the way we started off.
Q: And the economic situation in the North
The North is going to take a longer time. The war has destroyed the economy. So it will be a longer period but we have given special concessions for investment in the North double the normal concessions we have given the rest of the country, incentives.
Q: Can the arrangement you are involved in be called cohabitation  where one of the two main parties in the political system is divided and one of its groups has made common cause with the party that emerged victorious, or relatively victorious, in the parliamentary elections What would you say about the chemistry between that section of the SLFP which is with the President, and your party
Its more than just the two main parties working together in government. We are also having an understanding with the Opposition  the TNA and the JVP [JanathaVimukthiPeramuna] who supported President Maithripala Sirisena as the common candidate. They went separately for the parliamentary elections, the UNP had no separate deal with them. But they also were convinced. Even within the group of the UPFA [United Peoples Freedom Alliance] that sits on the other side, I dont think they want to go over the precipice. This whole new question of [SLFP dissidents] starting a separate party has been resisted by some of the members of the UPFA who are sitting in opposition. But its a new era. Its not only the UNP and SLFP working together; we also work with the other parties.
Weve made the whole Parliament into a government, because we have the oversight committees. And then you have a Cabinet. The exact executive policies will be looked at by the Cabinet but the oversight committees will look at implementation. Its really becoming a two-tier government. The first oversight committees were in the U.S., with the American presidential system. Secondly, in Europe theyve had the European Commission and the European Parliament. Now what we are experimenting with, the pilot project is having the oversight committees with a cabinet government, because the Prime Minister and the members of the Cabinet are also Members of Parliament. But the Ministers cannot be in the oversight committees; its generally backbenchers who chair them, both from the Government and the Opposition  its divided in a ratio amongst parties.
Q: So the mechanisms for different parties getting together in a broad-based way in the political system are there and working quite well.
Yes, its working. Can be improved, but its working.
Q: What is your perception of the rift within the SLFP  between the pro-Rajapaksa and pro-Sirisena groups Does it affect the unity of the government you lead Does the possibility of Mahinda Rajapaksas comeback concern you
We have factored in that there is a group around Mahinda Rajapaksa who will sit in the opposition. But within our framework of all groups in Parliament working in the oversight committees, there is discussion. Secondly, within the SLFP also some of the leading members who are with Rajapaksa attend the central committee meeting of the SLFP. Mahinda Rajapaksa cant afford to be out of the SLFP. Hell lose his base and they can take disciplinary action.
In my view, as time goes on he will lose the base support he has, because times are changing and the younger voters are not with him. So if they miss out on the younger voters, there will be other parties who will try to cater to them. As our policies succeed, people will realise that Mahinda Rajapaksa was a failure. I cant see a comeback by him, because when people make a change they never go back to the status quo. If they want to make another change, they will look at something new. But I dont think that will happen because people like the idea of the two main parties working together. They want to see the delivery taking place, thats what we are focusing on. Once the delivery is assured, it will cease to be a major problem. Till then youve got to live with a thorn on your side, and I think our political parties are capable of doing that.
Q: You are remaking the Constitution  although its not by a Constituent Assembly but a Constitutional Assembly, and you are bound by the rules of the 1978 Constitution.
We are not in any way challenging the authority of Parliament. But we have set ourselves up as a committee of the whole of the Parliament, which focusses only on the Constitution. And there is a Steering Committee which will send in the interim reports. And the Assembly which will debate. So once we have a final draft, we will send it to be passed by the Constitutional Assembly and sent to Parliament.
Q: How is that going, the time frame
Well, the six sub-committee reports are out. The Steering Committee now has to deal with the important ones  the nature of the state, religion, the exercise of executive, legislative, and judicial power. Those are some of the items. And the replacement of the executive presidency Those are the key ones being handled by the Steering Committee and once the debate on the six sub-committee reports is over in the first week of January [2017], we will present the report of the Steering Committee to the Assembly. Then the real debate on the nature of the Constitution will begin. It has to go to Parliament, be passed by two-thirds of Parliament, and then finally a referendum.
Q: Its fairly fast-tracked
It can be fast-tracked.
Q: You have the numbers in Parliament
We have the numbers in Parliament.
Q: And you hope that those who have reservations or are opposing some of these changes
I think some of them will come along.
Q: So the stakes are very high.
Yes, the stakes are always high in Sri Lanka!
Q: Is everyone agreed on doing away with the overbearing executive presidency
Yes, they have agreed. We are giving three options  for how the Prime Ministerial system should function. [The first option is the pure Westminster system. The second is a system where the Prime Minister is elected directly. The third option would require political parties to declare their Prime Ministerial candidates before the elections. In all three options, the President would be a non-executive head of state.]
Q: The attitude of the Tamil parties, the Tamil National Alliance seems to have been very constructive
Yes, very constructive, I must say. They have been taking part, they are very, very positive. I was there in the group that worked up to 1987. But this is the first time we are trying to do a Constitution without any party having an overall majority, not to speak of a two-thirds majority. That is good because we are striving to find common ground.
Q: Will there be a measure of agreement on devolution You already have the 13th Amendment.
There will be a measure of agreement because we discussed the matter with the Chief Ministers. Seven Chief Ministers are from the UPFA. Eight actually, if you take Trincomalee also. The UNP sits in the opposition but we discussed with the Chief Ministers and with the leaders of the opposition and had separate sessions with the Governors. And there is a three-member sub-committee which we appointed to do an ad hoc report on the relationship between the Centre and the Provincial Councils.
Q: Whats different this time in the negotiations on the Tamil question
I think everyone accepts the need to resolve it. Part of it is outside, thats the type of work we have to do on releasing land, helping people On this question of the nature of the state I cant find a major issue coming on that  weve got over a lot of the difficulties, theres a little bit more to be done.
Q: I suppose the challenge is to avoid veering in one direction or the other and finding a formulation to say that Sri Lanka must be united, it is one but...
People want that, yes.
Q: Without getting trapped in terminology
No. The Indian government has also said it must strengthen the 13th Amendment. Now actually we have got to deliver to the Tamil people and thats not a matter of law.
Q: Lets look at the elephant in the room, the Opposition which is adopting a nationalistic position. We see this political trend in India, you have it here as well. The cry will go up that the nation is in danger, or theres a danger of separatism, etc. Is such a scenario far-fetched
Were all patriots, were all nationalists. So we have no problem dealing with anyone who wants to raise that cry. They will find that people dont accept it. What we will decide on the nature of the state and other issues will be acceptable to everyone. We are politicians.
Q: As for the international demands [for an investigation into war crimes], they have been moderated or have quietened down
Yes, we also co-sponsored the [UNHRC] resolution. I cant see a major hitch on that.
Q: Obviously, it is desirable to have maximum support or unanimity for this process of changing the Constitution, making the changes you have referred to. Is that achievable
Well, we are trying to get unanimity. Lets see when the Steering Committee report is out.
Q: Are you engaging in discussions with Mr. Rajapaksa and others
We are trying to meet him next week, the Leader of the Opposition and I. [The meeting took place soon after the interview.] And with former President [Chandrika] Kumaratunga. Weve already met with the President.
Q: On the international front, starting with India
Things have been working out well with India. We are looking at trying to get the Economic and Technological Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) through. There has been general goodwill on both sides. The fishing issue must be resolved.
Q: Is it continuity or change in the Sri Lanka-India relationship It has been quite good for a while.
Continuity.
Q: The main outstanding issue with India is the fishermens issue, isnt it
Yes, its the fishermens issue. We should sort it out. We shouldnt allow that issue to My sympathies are with the northern fishermen who say, now let us fish in our own waters.
Q: Which is now possible.
Which is now possible, and the pressure is going to come from the North.
Q: From Tamils
Tamils.
Q: Coming back to the ETCA with India  you wanted it signed by the end of 2016. How does it fit into your economic vision for the country India seems to have indicated that the agreement cant be signed until mid-2017. Have there been areas of substantive disagreement between Colombo and New Delhi in the negotiations
There arent areas of substantive disagreement. I think theyre discussing it step by step. We would have liked it in 2016, but we can also still make room for it to be in 2017. But we would like it to take place in 2016-17, because the FTA [Free Trade Agreement] with China and the FTA with Singapore will both be signed in the early part of 2017. We will regain the facility of preferential exports to EU through the GSP Plus facility. We want the Indian agreement also quickly. Because, one, the Indian agreement paves the way for a tripartite [arrangement for trade and investment] by 2017  Sri Lanka, India, and Singapore.
The agreements we have between us mean that we are at the crucial entry points of the Bay of Bengal and we can work further on a closer economic union within the Bay of Bengal [region]. For that to succeed also, we require the agreement with India, because the five southern States [Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Kerala] and Sri Lanka  the total GDP of such an economy is over $500 billion with the possibility of doubling to a trillion dollars within a decade or so. The potential is enormous, so with our agreements with Singapore and with China, on their One Belt, One Road initiative, it is imperative that we sign the agreement with India as fast as possible.
Q: If we can turn to some major developments in international relations
We must look at the whole issue of international relations now after the referendum in the U.K. and the election of Donald Trump as the next President of the U.S. I think people have sent a message. I dont think any of the countries want to give up the dominance that they have but there should be a rearranging of priorities, which also I think would require Asia  the Asian countries  to see how we can increase cooperation. After all, we are the next growth centre, next to the West.
Q: Has Brexit adversely affected or benefitted Sri Lanka
Not benefitted us. We are worried that if there is a downturn, it can affect some of our exports. Britain has to work out what they want  is it a hard or a soft exit, they are still not clear. Then, if they want to re-establish the economic relations within the Commonwealth, theyll have to come up with some plan because there are so many players now, not only the U.K. And the bulk of the Commonwealth nations are around the Indian Ocean.
Q: What do you expect for our region from President-elect Donald Trump when he takes over
Hell do a new approach. There will be a reorganising of priorities, but so far the names for the cabinet show that he has picked some good choices  they will be right-wing, but then he came on a right-wing populist agenda. So lets see how it goes and what his style would be.
Q: I dont see the kind of perturbation there is in some other parts of the world, or even in the U.S., in India or Sri Lanka. Is it that you just accept it
They have voted and we must fit into it. And we never had the TPP [Trans-Pacific Partnership]. The TPP really was against us. It left China out, it left India out, it left South Asia out, and Indonesia didnt get into it. I think in a way it doesnt harm us at all and we can now work our own arrangements out. So first we feel as Asian countries that India, China, Japan must have some arrangement on economic cooperation within Asia. We have rivalries but we must work for that; there will be pressure for that. And once you get it going, you can see still that whatever problems there are in Japan or in the Chinese economy, it is still growing. India is growing at the fastest rate. Both the U.S. and the EU will have to deal with us. Australia wants to come in with Asia, its very clear, New Zealand, even the East African Coast must come into this. I think India has a lot of personal connections at that level.
Q: Sri Lankas relations with China continue to be good
Yes, it continues.
Q: Any change
No change. We discussed, we had some outstanding matters. We stopped the port city to ensure that it was in conformity with the laws, its going on and we found that land was the best we could get to have our financial city. Hambantota  we have negotiated debt-to-equity swap and industrialisation. And then Singapore's SurbanaJurong is designing Trincomalee. But India has indicated that they want to be involved and thats good by us. And maybe Japan. We have taken into account Indias security concerns, the fact that China wants to expand as an economic power  those are ones that we can balance and Japan has been a steadfast supporter of Sri Lanka.
Q: There have been some controversies about the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. Are you over that
I am the one who first initiated an internal inquiry; they gave the report; I gave it to the Parliament. And even in the new Parliament, I allowed the Committee on Public Enterprises to go ahead. The chairman was a member of the JVP  we all supported him, still support him. And they have made their recommendations; its unanimous, the recommendations for further inquiry. There are different views on the rationale or the reasoning, but it shows the parliamentary system is working. And I have submitted all the papers to the Attorney General, so thats no longer within my purview.
Q: To sum up, would you say the overall situation is markedly different from what it was before the presidential and parliamentary elections of 2015
Certainly different, more hopeful.
Q: You have been in government for a very long time, in politics, in the opposition. Is this situation qualitatively new
After 1977, yes, its qualitatively new and the fact is that most of the countries in Asia are also thinking that way. Starting in 1977, we were the exception and it took some time. China and India came along. We are also looking at new arrangements, we are in talks with India about how we can strengthen economic cooperation in the Bay of Bengal. I mean the population around the Bay of Bengal  the Indian States around it, the hinterland, plus the others  its twice the population of the European Union. Theres much more scope for growth.
Q: You have thought about this for some time.
Yes, thats why I want the ETCA also to come on because, on the one hand, we can have ETCA and the Singapore FTA with us. Secondly, the five southern States and Sri Lanka can make a very powerful combination.

Elections to local authorities before Mar.31: Minister
	
Elections to the local authorities would be held before March 31, Subject Minister Faiszer Musthapha said today.
He told a media briefing held at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) headquarters that the elections to provincial councils did not come under his purview.
Elections to the local authorities will be held soon after I receive the delimitation-committee report on December 27 or in any case before December 31. I will issue the gazette notification on the receipt of the report, minister said. "Although people blame me for the delay, I need to stress that I have no intention whatsoever of delaying these elections."
He pointed out that there were several issues that crop up when carrying out the functions of local bodies in the absence of public representation.
"I will try my best to minimize the contentious issues because I too am suffering from the lapses of the previous government. I would have been only too glad to hold the elections earlier if the previous delimitation reports were correct, the minister said.
He said pointing fingers was easy but understanding the problems involved was difficult.
Working as a National Government was not easy. Neither did the UNP nor the SLFP receive a mandate to rule the country. Some say that the SLFP ministers should leave the party, the minister said.
President Maithripala Sirisena was not selected to the presidential candidacy out of affection but because he was the only one who was able to defeat former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and the only one capable of taking up the challenge, the Minister said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

The Chief Incumbent of the Gangarama Vihara Hunupitiya Ven. Galboda Gnanissara Thera yesterday said the recent incidents regarding the Navy Commander and the IGP were ones that were carefully brewed to destabilize the administration of the country by interested persons.
The calm nature of the nation fades away when incidents such as the one which the Navy Commander and the IGP were involved, take place," the Ven. Thera said.
The situation in the country had become so bad as it had become difficult to carry out social work in our own hometowns," he added.
He said a time would come soon when the IGP and the Navy Commander would have to visit places without their uniforms. (Yohan Perera)

FM gives Htota deals new twist
	
The saga on future Chinese ownership of the Hambantota Port and the surrounding area took another turn today, when Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said that no land would be given to China, and that the proceeds from the transfer of Hambantota Port would be used as the government sees fit.
In response to a question from a journalist, Karunanayake said that he has no idea about a deal to provide China with 15,000 acres of land near the Hambantota Port for an industrial zone, and that no other part of the government is working behind his back to such end either.
I have no idea about such a thing. We are in a unity government, so there is nothing being done without all of us knowing, he said.
However, Karunanayake this October was quoted in international media reports as saying that the Sri Lankan government was in the final phases of talks to go ahead with the 15,000 acre industrial zone and that the agreement would be signed as soon as possible.
The proposal to provide 15,000 acres of land to China was initially publicized by Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama this July. Karunanayake requested that any inquiries about a deal to sell land to China be directed to Samarawickrama.
Locals living in the area earmarked for the industrial zone have been carrying out protests this week against selling land to China. When inquired of this situation, Karunanayake said that one of the opposition parties, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) must be creating issues.
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna must be saying that (sale of land to China), he said.
The current Sri Lankan government has recently pivoted to economic and foreign policies that seem to be increasingly featuring Chinaa strategy favoured by the former governmentfrom initial Western oriented policies.
The Chinese Ambassador in Sri Lanka had recently said that China is willing to extend support and investments exceeding US$ 5 billion if the Sri Lankan government was willing to provide the 15,000 acres of land in Hambantota, as well as land in other provinces for industrial zones as well.
Meanwhile, Karunanayake said that the funds collected from the transfer of 80 percent of shares to China for 99 years would not be used entirely to retire Chinese debt.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe until now had been continuously saying that the transfer, valued at over US$ 1 billion is not a sale, but a debt-to-equity swap to retire some of the US$ 8 billion loans taken from China in the past.
Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy had noted that the deal is not a debt-to-equity swap, but a sale.
MirrorBusiness inquired from Karunanayake why the government was receiving cash, instead of China wiping the transacted amount as debt from the books as is common in debt-to-equity arrangements, for which he replied saying that only the loans with interest rates as high as 8 percent will be written off.
We pay what is unwanted, ensure we get a gain from that, then ensure the surplus funds, instead of paying off 2 percent, we hold on. There are concessional loans as well. We make the maximum use of it, he said.
He noted that Sri Lanka currently has around US$ 760 million in high interest rate loans from many countries.
After we have paid back the loans, the money that comes into the consolidated fund can be used as we see fit, Karunanayake said, and later added, all the high interest rates will be paid off immediately, and the balance will be used for reserves and protective elements we intend to do in the future, he said.

India allows 100 TN pilgrims to attend Katchatheevu ceremony
	
The Indian Government has given its nod for participation of 100 fishermen pilgrims from Tamil Nadu in the December 23 consecration ceremony of St Antony's Church at Katchatheevu, Sri Lanka, the PTI reported today.
The ceremony, scheduled earlier for December 7, was postponed by Sri Lankan government to December 23 following the demise of former Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa.
As the Centre has granted permission to 100 fishermen from the state to attend the ceremony, the Tamil Nadu government said it would make adequate arrangements for the pilgrims.
New Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam had on December eight asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to direct the External Affairs Ministry to facilitate the participation of all fishermen devotees from the state intending to participate in the consecration ceremony of the church at Katchatheevu, an islet ceded by India to Sri Lanka in the 1970s.
In the letter, he had urged Modi to instruct Indian Ministry of External Affairs to accord political clearance for the visit of pilgrims to the church without any cap on the number of visitors.
He also recalled that Chief Secretary P. Ramamohana Rao had also written to Foreign Secretary S. Jaishankar seeking political clearance for up to 100 pilgrims from Rameswaram but the Ministry had allowed only 20.
Political clearance accorded for the participation of only 20 persons will disappoint the ardent devotees, he had stated.
The state's fishermen were "very keen" on protecting their traditional and customary access to this "important place of worship," he had said.
Though he had stated that no restrictions should be placed on the number of participants, the Centre gave its permission for 100 fishermen to attend the ceremony, official sources said.

Iraqi gains reveal huge scale of IS arms industry
	
QARAQOSH AFP Dec14, 2016-  Factories churning out tens of thousands of munitions and an entire street turned into a conveyor belt for car bombs: advances by Iraqi forces around Mosul have laid bare the scale of the Islamic State groups arms industry. 
In the more than two years since it seized control over swathes of the country, IS established a sprawling and highly organised system that experts say no other insurgent group has matched. 
The capability has seriously boosted the threat from the group as it battles ferociously to cling to territory in Iraq and Syria -- and the fresh intelligence could now prove vital in countering its plots to carry out attacks on the West. 
Iraqi army deminer Hashim Ali picked his way carefully through the rubble as he explained how IS transformed Mart Shmony street in Qaraqosh, some 16 kilometres (10 miles) southeast of Mosul, into a production line of death after seizing the town in 2014 and forcing the mainly Christian population to flee.

Legalise sex work to curb spread of STDs: CSWR
	
		B. Maheshwari
		The Centre for Sex Workers Rights (CSWR) renewed their call to the authorities urging that their profession be legally recognised as a means of controlling the spread of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs), especially HIV.
CSWR Co-Chairman B. Maheshwari said streamlining and legalizing sex work would solve many of their concerns including the control of STDs.
She said many Sri Lankan sex workers leave for countries like Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore because their profession is not recognized here. On their return, they are often found to be infected with STDs, she told Daily Mirror.
Video by Sanath Desmond
Ms. Maheswari said instead of focusing on their plight everyone looks down on them.
When the police arrest us and produce us in court we are remanded for two weeks. When we are in remand, there is no one to look after our children and to feed them. There could be instances where female children are molested. The industry is not going anywhere. As we see it, the only solution is to legalise the profession. By doing so, we can control the spread of STD as well, she said.
Ms. Maheshwari, who has often visited India, said India has legalised sex work and it was not frowned upon by the people there.
		Dr. Palitha Mahipala
		Meanwhile, Health Services Director General Palitha Mahipala said the spread of HIV in Sri Lanka was remarkably less than in other countries in the region.
The number of HIV cases reported in the country is less than even 0.1%, he said.
Dr. Mahipala said they had identified the groups which are prone to the disease and were carrying out programmes to educate them and prevent the spread of HIV.
National STD/AIDS Control Programme Director Sisira Liyanage said a majority of HIV-infected people in the country were men.
Unsafe sex has been identified as the main cause of the spread of HIV, he said adding that awareness programmes among those who practice unsafe sex was important to tackle the spread of HIV.
		Dr. Sisira Liyanage
		We have identified about 15,000 sex workers but there are more who use phones and internet as a means of contacting clients. We cant approach them and conduct a survey because they carry out their profession in secrecy. We request them to come to the clinics, Dr.Liyanage said.
With regard to the call to legalise sex work, as a means of preventing the spread of HIV and STD, Dr. Liyanage said it would streamline the profession but legalising alone would not curb the spread of these diseases. 
If sex work was legalized, then sex workers should be issued a license after they were screened for STDs. However, still there are sex workers engaged in profession without licenses even in countries where it sex work is legalized. We, the health sector, have to continue to work whether the profession was legalized or not. When it comes to tackling HIV, legalizing sex work alone is not enough. It is good for their rights, he said.

## Title: Little Hearts   LRH  fundraiser

Little Hearts   LRH  fundraiser
	
It can happen to anyone was one of the lines on the brochures of the little hearts campaign. Judging by the diversity of the little patients at Lady Ridgeway Hospital in Colombo, this statement cannot be argued with. Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) can strike anyone regardless of age. This is precisely the reason Little Hearts project launched a nationwide campaign with the view of providing immediate access to critical care to all Sri Lankan children struggling with CHD and other critical illnesses.


From the countless charities asking us to open our hearts and wallets for a cause, this campaign strikes a different note. A fundraising event held at LRH recently appealed to little children across the country to join the till parade or keta-perahera. The campaign saw little donors from across the island bring their tills to the LRH in Borella help save another childs life. 
Consultant Paediatric Cardiologist at Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children Dr. Duminda Samarasinghe who spearheaded the programme said it was heartwarming to see so many parents and children contribute to the cause. This is what these children have saved all their lives, the question is where are the adults questioned Dr. Samarasinghe. 
Endorsed by the Sri Lanka College of Paediatricians, the project aims to address a dire need of what is considered to be the worlds largest tertiary care childrens hospital. The Childrens Heart Centre (CHC) of LRH since 2007 has tripled its number of annual surgical procedures from 273 to 882 cases. The LRH cardiology teams passion and efforts have pushed the hospitals capacity for the treatment of children with heart disease from 15% to 60% in just a few years. However, the passionate team at CHC face challenges in their capacity to treat children in need. 
According to hospital estimates, over 3,000 are children born with CHD in Sri Lanka per year. Out of this number, the hospital can only treat 1,700 children. That means over 40% of these children do not have appropriate access to treatment and are forced to await it. The sad truth is that most of them dontLRHs growing waiting lists testify to the hospitals current inability to cope with the number of critically-ill children in need of its services. When faced with waiting lists with a severely ill child in hands, desperate parents resort to private hospitals. Insurance does not cover conditions such as CHD, so they sell their property and move mountains to defeat the odds.
The construction of the LRHs Cardiac and Critical Care Complex will ensure that every critically ill child in Sri Lanka has immediate access to quality care. The Complex is deemed a government priority but unless backed with external funding and support, massive projects like these tend to develop over several years to well over a decade. 
This new ten-storey building will introduce four state-of-the-art cardiac operating theatres, increase the number of cardiac ICU beds from 18 to 40, include over 100 medical and neonatal intensive care beds, as well as the areas for advanced cardiac investigations and staff training facilities to provide optimum care for these children. 
If our goal is to raise LKR 2 billion, the amount we would invest in saving each life would be LKR10,000. It will help secure facilities that will finally put an end to waiting list nightmares and provide immediate critical care to all the children in need, Dr. Samarasinghe added. 
The project encourages kind donors to make their valuable contributions through the following options.

Navy Commander did not attack journalist: SF
	
Minister Sarath Fonseka said yesterday the Navy Commander had not attacked a journalist but he had only pushed him away from the security circle and that everything had happened in an acceptable manner.
He said the Navy Commander had arrived at the port to assist in piloting the ship which was seized by the protestors and clad in the uniform required for that purpose.
It was reported in the media that the navy commander had arrived at the scene with a dress meant for sports. But it was a uniform worn by marine pilots. We have only two marine pilots in the Navy and the Navy Commander is one of them, the minister said.
The Navys Special Boat Squadron (SBS) had formed a security circle because of the protestors occupying the port premises. The journalist who was said to have been attacked had breached the security circle without permission and had attempted to video the SBF operations. Then the Navy Commander had pushed him out, he said.

NFF urges Govt. to remove the Navy Commander
	
The National Freedom Front (NFF) today urged the government to immediately remove the Navy Commander from his post and launch an investigation to the incident where the Navy Commander had allegedly assaulted a journalist during the protest at the Hambantota Harbour.
Addressing a media briefing, NFF Media Spokesman Mohammed Muzammil said the government has tactfully used the Navy Commander to cover up the selling of 80 per cent of the Hambantota Port to a Chinese company.
The government has tarnished the reputation of the Sri Lanka Navy as well as the Navy Commander following this incident. At present the government has called for an investigation from the Navy Commander instead of removing him from his post, he said.
He said it was evident from these incidents that the government was in need to make the journalist proved to be guilty whereas the Navy Commander would remain out of the blame.
He said the NFF had decried the suppressive nature of the government. The government should have dealt with the protesting workers at the Hambantota Harbour in a more humane manner by arranging a discussion for them with the related authorities, he added.
Meanwhile, the NFF urged the government to refrain from selling the 80 per cent of the Hambantota Harbour to a Chinese company and added that the government should offer an immediate solution to the issues of the workers at the Hambantota Harbour. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Philippines President says he personally killed people
	
MANILA AFP /Dec14, 2016- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has said he personally killed suspected criminals when he was mayor of a southern city to set an example for police. 
Duterte made the comments in a speech late on Monday night to businessmen as he discussed his campaign to eradicate illegal drugs, that has seen police and unknown assailants kill thousands of people since he became president on June 30. 
After speaking about police killing suspects during the current crime war, Duterte said he led similar efforts when he was mayor of Davao, the major southern city that he ruled for most of the previous 20 years. 
In Davao I used to do it personally. Just to show to the guys (police) that if I can do it why cant you, Duterte said in his speech at the presidential palace.

Popular Chinese Muslim website shutters after Xi Jinping petition
	
AFP/14 December 2016- 
One of Chinas most popular online communities for Muslims has been shuttered after posting a petition asking Chinese President Xi Jinping to stop his brutal suppression of activists, the letters authors told AFP Wednesday. 
Since 2003, the Zhongmu Wang website, or 2muslim.com, functioned as an online network of Muslims sharing Islam, according to archived descriptions. 
But as of Wednesday the site was inaccessible, showing only a message stating it was under maintenance. 
Two of its affiliated social media accounts were also unavailable, displaying messages that declared one account abnormal and the other in violation of required guidelines. 
China officially has more than 23 million Muslims, though some independent estimates say there may be as many as 50 million -- which would put China among the worlds top 10 Muslim nations. 
While Chinas constitution enshrines freedom of religious belief, authorities keep strict limits on it, recognising only five belief systems and seeking to control their messages.

Hundreds of sex assaults were reported across Germany on New Years Eve, prompting an anti-migrant backlash 

Daily Mail/14 December 2016- 
Russian and Syrian secret services may be encouraging refugees in Germany to carry out orchestrated sex attacks, in a bid to oust Angela Merkel from office, it is claimed. 
The extraordinary assertion was made by an expert from the European Council on Foreign Relations, who said the foreign powers could collude to destabilise Germany ahead of next years election. 
Gustav Gressel, a Russian expert at the think-tank, said small numbers of refugees with links to the Kremlin and Syrian security services could be mobilised to sway public opinion against the Chancellor. 
Citing a series of sex assaults in the city of Cologne during New Years Eve celebrations at the start of 2016 he told Bild: What would happen, for example, if a similar event were repeated at a summer festival before the election as in the Silvesternacht in Cologne

Salary hike for techies: PM
	
The Government yesterday hinted out a salary hike to attract skilled technologically competent people.
This was hinted out by both President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at the opening of Jinaratana Vocational Training Centre at Hikkaduwa to mark the birthday of Chief Incumbent of the Gangarama Vihara, Hunupitiya Ven. Galboda Gnanissara Thera yesterday morning.
President Sirisena said Sri Lanka did not have an issue of unemployment. He said what Sri Lanka was experiencing was a dearth of skilled and technologically competent people to fill large number of job vacancies.
There are more than 100,000 jobs in the skilled and technological fields both in the government and in the technological centres," he said.
"One cannot find many skilled and technologically competent people even in the State sector though there are GCE Ordinary and Advanced Level qualified persons. But there is a dearth in personnel who are technically competent," the President added.
Paying a tribute to Venerable Gnanissara Thera the President said the Gangarama temple had won the respect of people of all religions. This he said was because the role carried out by the temple and the Chief Monk did not confine to religious work alone.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said the government would think of increasing wages to attract the skilled and technologically competent persons.
We will have to increase salaries of skilled and other technological experts as they will opt to obtain employment abroad, if we don't offer them higher salaries," the Prime Minister said.
Further, the Prime Minister said the country needed personnel with IT skills, those who were specialized in the hotel and tourism industry and competent persons in other industries.
Premier Wickremesinghe lauded Venerable Gnanissara Thera for the role he had played in producing youth with vocational skills. (Yohan Perera)

Super Minister could undermine Presidents authority: GL
	
The governments move to create the post of Super Minister with omnipotent-like powers could even undermine the authority of President Maithripala Sirisena, the joint opposition said.
It said if the Development (Special Provisions) Bill was enacted creating a Super Minister, then he or she would be able to take decisive decisions regarding the economy of the country, thereby manipulating authorities and departments, even bypassing subject ministers.
The Super Minister will be able to control institutions such as the Board of Investment (BOI), the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) and the Urban Development Authority (UDA). If something goes wrong or the Super Minister makes an errant decision, then no one will be able to take action against him or her as this post will be vested with legal immunity. This is a serious situation. The powers of the President would be betrayed with the appointment of such a minister, Professor G.L. Peiris told a news conference.
He said the Super Minister would even be able to decide as to which investor should be given tax concessions and which investor should not. This is a responsibility of the Treasury, not a mere minister, Prof. Peiris added.
He further stated that the United National Party (UNP) had openly asked the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) ministers to leave the government if they had criticisms about it.
The Super Minister will also absorb the portfolios of key SLFP ministers, leaving them with no other option but to exit the government if they didnt quit willingly, he said.
He also said they would challenge the Development Bill once it was tabled in Parliament. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

RT.COM/14 Dec, 2016- 
The US will halt a planned arms sale to Saudi Arabia due to strong concerns over civilian deaths in the countrys Yemen campaign. The announcement came just 48 hours after UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson restated his support for the Gulf kingdom. 
The US administration will also limit future air training in Saudi Arabia to prioritize targeting, officials said. 
Up to 10,000 people have been killed since fighting began in Yemen, including 4,000 civilians, according to UN estimates. 
The UN stated in August that the Saudi-led coalition is responsible for 60 percent of the civilian deaths. 
US action on Saudi Arabia runs in stark contrast to British policy to the Gulf kingdom, which it continues to back militarily. 
Speaking at Prime Ministers Questions (PMQs) on Wednesday, the PM defended Britains continued support for Saudi Arabia.

Vardha cyclone doubles revenue generated by overflight charges
	
As a result of the Vardha cyclone that hit the South Eastern Indian region, the number of aircraft compelled to fly over Sri Lankan airspace had marked a steep increase, and thus doubled the revenue generated by overflight charges during the past three days, the Sri Lanka Air Traffic Controllers Association (SLATCA) said yesterday.
Meanwhile, SLATCA Vice President Tharindu Gajadeera said the number of flights that travelled over national airspace was in average between 90 and 120, but it had now shown a record number of 180 to 200. While a vast area of the Indian Ocean was faced with the threat of Vardha, Chennai remained the worst affected, he said.
All aircraft which otherwise fly over the cyclone-hit area have requested detour from their usual tracks and to fly over the airspace that comes under the Colombo Flight Information Region. This situation had been challenging for the Colombo Air Traffic Controllers as most aircraft deviated from their regular paths. With limited resources, the controllers managed to keep the regional air traffic flow moving without causing major delays to the airlines, he said.
However, Air Traffic Controllers stationed at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) also had to take extra effort to manage limited aircraft parking space at the BIA, as more flights got cancelled and some aircraft bound to Chennai remained stranded.
As the Chennai Air Traffic Control Centre is gradually coming back to their regular operations and the adverse effects of the cyclone are dissipating, we expect the number of over-flying aircraft to return to its normal figures, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

We will oppose the sale of land to China: JVP
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today it was totally opposed to the sale of some 15,000 acres of land in Hambantota to a Chinese company and warned it would not allow the government to go ahead with this sale.
The government claims that the lands have been sold to set up an economic zone. Only 2,000 acres have been allocated for the 17 economic zones in the country and most of the lands allocated have not been used. The biggest economic zone in India, Sri City India is located on 7,000 acres. We must stop this sale of land, JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said.
He said they would launch a massive protest campaign in January next year against the governments destructive economic policy of selling State property to private companies and invited the people to join them in this struggle.
Mr. Dissanayake said the Government had planned to sell a large amount of land including Ports, graphite mines and mineral mines to private companies.
The government has planned to sell the Hambantota Port to a Chinese company saying it was debt-ridden with no ships arriving at the port. How will ships come after it is sold to a private company This is a Port which can be developed as a service port, which was a proposal made during the tenure of former president Chandrika Kumaratunge, he said.
Mr. Dissanayake said the government had invented a new concept known as PPP - Public-Private-Partnership to continue the privatization of State resources.
This is not the first time that a governmenthas thought that the country could be developed by sellingState resources, he said and warned that it would do its best to protect the Hambantota Port and ensure that all its employees would be absorbed into the Ports Authority.
We will take to the streets to carry out our struggle. We will fight for the rights of the port employees. It is during the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime that these employees were recruited through a manpower company creating this controversial situation, he said.(Ajith Siriwardana)

## Title: Yahoo says 1 billion user accounts were hacked in 2013

Yahoo says 1 billion user accounts were hacked in 2013
	
Yahoo has discovered a 3-year-old security breach that enabled a hacker to compromise more than 1 billion user accounts, breaking the company's own record for the biggest security breach in history, the ABC News reported.
The company disclosed on Wednesday that the incident occurred in August 2013. Yahoo announced a separate hack three months ago. That breach affected at least 500 million users, which had been the most far-reaching hack until the latest revelation.
Both lapses occurred during the reign of Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, a once-lauded leader who found herself unable to turn around the company in the four years since her arrival. Earlier this year, Yahoo agreed to sell its digital operations to Verizon Communications for $4.8 billion  a deal that may now be imperiled by the hacking revelations.
Yahoo didn't say if it believes the same hacker might have pulled off two separate attacks. The Sunnyvale, California, company blamed the late 2014 attack on a hacker affiliated with an unidentified foreign government, but said it hasn't been able to identify the source behind the 2013 intrusion.
Yahoo has more than a billion monthly active users, although some have multiple accounts and others have none at all. An unknown number of accounts were affected by both hacks.
In both attacks, the stolen information included names, email addresses, phone numbers, birthdates and security questions and answers. The company says it believes bank-account information and payment-card data were not affected.
But hackers also apparently stole passwords in both attacks. Technically, those passwords should be secure; Yahoo said they were scrambled twice  once by encryption and once by another technique called hashing. But hackers have become adept at cracking secured passwords by assembling huge dictionaries of similarly scrambled phrases and matching them against stolen password databases.
That could mean trouble for any users who reused their Yahoo password for other online accounts. Yahoo is requiring users to change their passwords and invalidating security questions so they can't be used to hack into accounts. (You may get a reprieve if you've changed your password and questions since September.)
Security experts said the 2013 attack was likely the work of a foreign government fishing for information about specific people. One big tell: It doesn't appear that much personal data from Yahoo accounts has been posted for sale online, meaning the hack probably wasn't the work of ordinary criminals.
That means most Yahoo users probably don't have anything to worry about, said J.J. Thompson, CEO of Rook Security.
News of the additional hack further jeopardizes Yahoo's plans to fall into Verizon's arms. If the hacks cause a user backlash against Yahoo, the company's services wouldn't be as valuable to Verizon, raising the possibility that the sale price might be re-negotiated or the deal may be called off. The telecom giant wants Yahoo and its many users to help it build a digital ad business.
After the news of the first hack broke, Verizon said it would re-evaluate its Yahoo deal and in a Wednesday statement said it will review the "new development before reaching any final conclusions." Spokesman Bob Varettoni declined to answer further questions.
At the very least, the security lapses "definitely will help Verizon in its negotiations to lower the price," Litan predicted. Yahoo has argued that news of the 2014 hack didn't negatively affect traffic to its services, strengthening its contention that the Verizon deal should be completed under the original terms.
"This just adds to fuel to the fire and it won't help Yahoo's cause," said Eric Jackson, a longtime critic of the company's management. Although he has in the past, Jackson doesn't currently own Yahoo stock.
Investors appeared worried about the Verizon deal. Yahoo's shares fell 96 cents, or 2 percent, to $39.95 after the disclosure of the latest hack.
