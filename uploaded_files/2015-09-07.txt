A dockyard at Hambantota Port
	
	The government in a bid to make the Hambantota Port a viable commercial venture, has decided to develop dockyard facilities at the port at an estimated cost of Rs. 2 billion.
	A Chinese Company has responded positively to Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga?s call for expression of interests from potential investors to build dockyard facilities at the Hambantota Port, a ministry source said today.
	The minister told Daily Mirror discussions were likely to be held with the Chinese company to work out the terms and conditions for investing in the Hambantota Port Project to make it a profit-making venture with employment opportunities for several thousands.
	?The expression of interest for investment in the Hambantota Port Project has been forwarded to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe by China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd. (CHEC). The expression of interest has been referred to the Sub Committee on Economic Affairs and it has instructed that a total package be formulated for this investment,? he said.
	The minister has also conducted a several rounds of talks with SLPA officials and CHEC representatives to discuss the CHEC potential and interest to develop, manage and operate a dockyard for ship building and repair at the Hambantota Port.
	Meanwhile, Daily Mirror learns that the CHEC has requested the issuance of a letter indicating the Government's interest in granting them an exclusivity period of 12 months to prepare a detailed plan and a feasibility study and sign an MoU between the GOSL and the CHEC.
	The minister is reported to have instructed Ministry Secretary L.P. Jayampathy to issue a letter to CHEC expressing the government?s willingness to proceed with the project based on Government regulations and procedures.
	The first phase of the Hambantota Port was launched on November 18, 2010 with the ceremonial berthing of the naval vessel "Jetliner". The total estimated cost of Phase 1 was US$361 million (approximately Rs.47 billion) out of which 85% was funded by the Exim Bank of China.
	The Habantota Port Project came under heavy critisism from the opposition which alleged that the project had failed to provide the expected dividends to the economy and that the entire project was a waste of money. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Fitch rates BOC?s Subordinated Debentures Final ?AA(lka)?
	
		 		 
		 
			
?Fitch Ratings has assigned Bank of Ceylon?s (BOC; AA+(lka)/Stable) proposed up to Rs.8 billion of subordinated debentures a final National Long-Term Rating of ?AA(lka)?. The assignment of the final rating follows the receipt of documents conforming to information already received, and the final rating is the same as the expected ratings assigned on 17 July 2015. ?
?The proposed subordinated debentures, which will have tenors of five and eight years and carry fixed and floating coupons, will be listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange. BOC plans to use the proceeds to strengthen its Tier 2 capital base and reduce asset and liability maturity mismatches.?
?The proposed subordinated debentures are rated one notch below BOC?s National Long-Term Rating to reflect the subordination to senior unsecured creditors. The issuer rating is driven by Fitch?s expectation of extraordinary support from the government of Sri Lanka (BB-/Stable). This stems from BOC?s high systemic importance, quasi-sovereign status, role as a key lender to government, and full state ownership. The Stable Outlook on BOC reflects the Stable Outlook on the sovereign?s rating. ?
?Any change in BOC?s National Long-Term Rating will affect the issue rating to the same extent. ?
?Any change in Sri Lanka?s sovereign rating, or in the perception of state support to BOC, could result in a change in the ratings of BOC. Visible demonstration of preferential support for BOC in the form of an explicit guarantee will be instrumental to an upgrade of its National Long-Term Rating.?

Filing a further report in Court, the CID moved Court that case proceedings pertaining to the Avant Garde?s floating armoury maintained at the Galle port be terminated.
The CID informed Court that in accordance with the Attorney General's advice and the facts revealed during the investigations there was no need to extend the travel ban on Avant Guard Maritime Service (Pvt.) Ltd Chairman Nissanka Senadhipathi.
Thus the Additional Magistrate lifted the travel ban imposed on Mr. Senadhipathi and directed that the Controller of Immigration and Emigration be informed accordingly.
Court had earlier restrained Mr. Senadhipathi from leaving the country because of the ongoing investigations into the floating armoury maintained at the Galle Port.(Lakmal Sooriyagoda)
