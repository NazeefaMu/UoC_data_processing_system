HRW urges SL to ensure free and fair election
	
Authorities in Sri Lanka should ensure that voters have safe and secure access to the polls to vote in parliamentary elections on Monday (17), Human Rights Watch (HRW) said yesterday.
Local monitoring groups have reported numerous incidents of election-related violence and campaigning irregularities in the month leading up to the nationwide polls.
??With evidence already of violence in the run-up to these elections, Sri Lankan authorities should take all necessary steps to protect voters and party supporters from attacks, threats, and intimidation,? said Brad Adams, Asia director. ?The authorities should also ensure that voters can travel safely and securely to the polling booths and back.?
??Sri Lanka has a long history of attackers getting away with election-related violence. A few arrests, while a positive step, do not address these longstanding concerns,? Adams said. ?State authorities need to pursue each attack vigorously to send an unequivocal message that there will be no obstacles to fair and free elections.?
The Sri Lankan Election Commission and the state security forces had played a constructive and neutral role during the January 8 presidential elections. Those authorities should ensure that police and other security forces act in an impartial manner throughout the electoral process and respect the human rights of all voters.
?The role played by the security forces during and after Election Day will send an important message about the future of human rights in Sri Lanka,? Adams said. ?Meeting the basic requirements of a free and fair election is an important step toward addressing the country?s persistent rights problems.?

## Title: <U+200B>Indian police unable to obtain inputs from ex-LTTE cadre

<U+200B>Indian police unable to obtain inputs from ex-LTTE cadre
	
		 		 
		 
			
A former militant of the proscribed LTTE K. Krishnakumar (39) arrested by the Indian police in Tamil Nadu on July 20 turned out to be a hard nut to crack and the ?Q? Branch police could arrest only one person, a Sri Lankan Tamil who had offered financial assistance to him in the aftermath of his arrest, police sources said.
After the special branch team arrested him on the night of July 20 and remanded him in judicial custody, the Q branch police took his custody for four days but could not obtain any valuable information about the possible regrouping of those who had served in LTTE and whether they were trying to revive the movement after it was defeated by the Lankan forces in the civil war in 2009.
True to the nature of a hardcore militant, he was a hard nut to crack, the sources said adding he pleaded ignorance of any network operating in Tamil Nadu. ?If we posed four questions, he would answer one, that too very vaguely,? the sources said.
Krishnakumar was arrested at the coastal Uchipuli when he came down from Madurai to take a clandestine boat ride to cross over to Talaimannar.
He was carrying 75 cyanide capsules, 300 gm of cyanide power, four Global Positioning System (GPS) and seven mobile phones.
He had served in the LTTE in the 1990s and came to Tamil Nadu through a valid passport in 2009, police said.
Someone in Madurai had handed over the cyanide capsules and the gadgets to be taken to Talaimannar and he would not know beyond that, he told the police during interrogation. The then Q branch Superintendent of Police K. Bhuvaneeshwari also tried her best during the interrogation, the sources added.
Based on his information, Q branch police had arrested one V. Subaskaran (39), a Lankan Tamil in Chennai but could not make further headway after the arrest, the sources said.
He was residing in Chennai with his family for about six years and used to receive money from foreign sources.
He had given money to Krishnakumar through a person, the sources added. He was working as a security in a private company and now lodged in Puzhal central prison.
N. Rajendran (44), the local Tamil who had brought Krishnakumar in a car from the Mattuthavani bus stand in Madurai for the illegal ferrying had never met him before.
He was waiting at the bus stand and the former militant came near his car after calling him over phone, the sources said.(The Hindu)

Six LTTErs arrested in India
	
Six LTTE men were arrested on Friday in central Kolkata by special task force.
They all were Sri Lankan Tamils and came to Kolkata four days before from Chennai.
The police are probing why the six came to Kolkata before the Independent Day celebrations. Two of them -- Guna Sekharan and Bala Singham are senior leaders of the banned outfit. Police are checking if they came for any operations or for any reconnaissance.
Even the police are interrogating them to find if they had links with Maoists, as there are reports that the Maoists are gradually regrouping in Bengal and have plans to start guerilla warfare in Jungalmahal area of Bengal.
Moreover, the police are also probing if LTTE was supplying arms to the Maoists. (Times of India)
