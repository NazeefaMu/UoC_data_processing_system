World Finance, the respected UK-based magazine, has reaffirmed Ceylinco Life as the Best Life Insurance Company in Sri Lanka for a second consecutive year, following an in-depth assessment of key performance indicators.
The prestigious accolade is based on scores accorded to the company on multiple parameters pertaining to long term insurance. These include underwriting process/process efficiency; policy maintenance  the process of reviewing clients policies, appropriateness of coverage and cost per policy; exposure to risk; customer retention rate; time taken to settle claims; new customer acquisition rate and financial stability  premium income, life fund and market share.
Eleven consecutive years of market leadership in Sri Lanka is by itself an emphatic statement of our status as the countrys best life insurer, Ceylinco Life Managing Director/CEO R. Renganathan said. However, an independent assessment of key performance indicators by a panel of expert international analysts is always helpful in benchmarking the company.
The World Finance judging panel boasts over 230 years of financial and business journalism, supported by a research team that works round the clock to ensure its award winners are the most deserving in their sector.
For the year ending 31st December 2014, Ceylinco Life reported total income of Rs 18.54 billion with premium income of Rs 12 billion and investment income of Rs 6.83 billion.

Launched in 2007, World Finance magazines award programmes are tailored to provide a comprehensive analysis of the very best in each market. The judging panel is required to avoid bias towards criteria such as depth of practice and size of company, in order to get an insight into different geographies and niche areas.

## Title: Dodgy SLC tender handling irks suppliers

Dodgy SLC tender handling irks suppliers
	
	Questions have been raised by different parties over the manner in which Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) has handled a tender estimated to be worth Rs. 20 million to supply 200 cricket kit bags to schools and an e-mail exchange between one of the bidders and some SLC interim committee members shows how certain members of SLC interim committee had attempted to influence the tender process.
	Sources said that SLC had finally offered the contract to the brand SS in India through a local contact who deals in sports goods with connections to the Interim Committee. They have made the third lowest bid of US $ 258.55 per kit bag (a total of US $ 51,710 or Rs. 7.34 million). We reliably understand that appointed local agents in Sri Lanka for SS did not participate in the tender.
	The lowest bid had been made by a little known brand called Ranson at US $ 180 per bag while the second lowest bid had come from reputed international cricket brand SG who made a bid of US $228 per bag.
	SLC interim committee member Kushil Gunasekara who headed the Tender opening committee was accused of supporting Ranson by one bidder who had forwarded an email exchange between himself and Gunasekara to SLC Interim committee chairman Sidath Wettimuny. It is believed that Wettimuny distributed copies of this mail exchange to the other SLC Interim committee members at a later meeting in order to investigate the matter.
	Ranson had made the lowest bid of US$ 180 per bag, but the material had been of very inferior quality and had been rejected by the Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC) subsequently.
	The closing date for submission of offers was the 21st of September 2015 at 3.00pm. All samples were also required to be handed over by 3.00pm. However, Gunasekara had brought the samples of Ranson as he walked in to SLC for the Tender opening. He had accepted this fact in a mail sent to SGs local representative later.
	Yes I did bring the sample as it had been delivered to my office at the time of the Tender opening just before 4pm, Gunasekara wrote to the bidder.
	However, Gunasekara had explained that he was just trying to save money for SLC through his method and had obtained the help of an Australian based Sports goods shop owner Harry Solomons who was born in Sri Lanka to rope in the brand Ranson.
	Obviously to get the best value through my charitable network as requested by Sidath (Wettimuny) which Ashley (de Silva, SLC CEO) was aware as well, Harry helped me to find Ranson brand who quoted the lowest, Gunasekara wrote.
	Our Intention is to save every cent to benefit SLC and by my intervention it seems like that objective has been accomplished, added Gunasekara.
	However, SG had replied pointing out that SLCs advertisement did not call for the cheapest option.
	At what point did SLC mention that they were only looking for the cheapest option If so, SG being the largest cricket goods manufacture in the world with the widest range of goods on offer could have easily tendered as per your requirement without any complications. As per the advertisement attached, it is nowhere mentioned that SLC was looking only for the cheapest or to submit just one sample item. Also, if you could have fulfilled the requirement through your charitable network, why bother to waste our time, money and all that effort, questioned the supplier.
	Unlike Ranson, SG has given SLC a choice and quoted accordingly as per the samples handed over and nothing inferior. So if you are comparing prices, please do not try to compare apples against Oranges. If you may know, theres a huge price difference between a Grade 1 and Grade 4 bat. I learned it the hard way spending time in the SG factory for over 4 days in Meerat/ New Delhi, he wrote. 
	I have no issue SLC getting the best deal. My point however, you personally getting involved & influencing the process. You as an IC member should not have got involved at any given time. If IC members can influence, what is the point following a Tender procedure In my view, this is a gross violation and simply not acceptable, he added.
	Check the advertisement carefully, Tender closed at 3 pm and any bids or samples received thereafter are not acceptable. We went through a lot of hassles and incurred massive courier costs, etc to ensure that the samples were delivered before closing time. But you have clearly stated that you brought the samples at 4 PM. This is a total violation which should be inquired and Ranson bid should be disqualified immediately, he pointed out.
	By the way who & whats Ranson Do they at least have an agent in Sri Lanka except you in case of any clarifications, issues, etc Do they have the capacity to handle such a tender Sad to say rather dodgy & disappointed over your involvement & justification, he wrote.
	The TEC that comprised of Carlton Bernadus (Chairman), Dilshan De Silva (Schools Cricket Association), Representative from SLC Coaching Department, Harsha Gunaratne, Ashantha Dassanayake and Daksha Jayakody (Accountant) had ranked SG to be the number one in quality, SS to be number two and Ranson to be number 5 in quality.
	In addition, its believed that SG also offered a kit sponsorship for the National U19 team since some of the players are already under contract with them. (Channaka de Silva)

Govt. seeks Chinese loan for Central Expressway
	
	The government has sought a loan arrangement with China to construct the first phase of the Colombo Kandy expressway commonly called the Central Highway, a Minister said.
	The concessionary loan will be obtained from Export and Import Bank of China.
	Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella told Daily Mirror that the highway would be constructed in three phases, and the second one would be funded by Asian Development Bank (ADB). However, he said the financial arrangement had not been made with anyone for the final phase of the highway.
	The Central Highway is very important. It will open up the entire country improving access all the major towns and cities, he said.
	The Minister said the United National Party (UNP) initially planned to construct this expressway during 2002/2004 tenure, but the next successive government did not proceed with it.
	Instead, that government concentrated on the southern expressway. Kandy is the second largest city. Therefore, fast connectivity between Colombo and Kandy is very important, he said. (Kelum Bandara)

HSBC partners Sri Lankan govt. to raise largest bond issuance
	
		 		 
		 
			
HSBC has advised the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) on behalf of Sri Lanka to complete a US$ 1.5 billion, 10-year international sovereign bond issuance.
The transaction, which was priced at a yield of 6.85 percent per annum, marks the second 10-year sovereign bond issue in the international capital markets in 2015 and Sri Lankas ninth overall and largest ever bond offering. The final order books stood at US$ 3.3 billion, an oversubscription of 2.2 times.
Patrick Gallagher, CEO of HSBC Sri Lanka and Maldives said, HSBC is delighted to once again have supported the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in issuing the second ten year sovereign bond having partnered the government of Sri Lanka on all of its sovereign bond issuances since 2007. HSBC continues to be a dominant force in the debt capital markets in Asia and this transaction further stands testament to the ability we have in closing large capital markets transactions and manifests our strong and continued commitment to the country.
Fitch Ratings, Moodys Investors Service and Standard and Poors had rated the Issue at BB-, B1 and B+ respectively.
The strong order book from investors across Asia, Europe and the US meant Sri Lanka was able to price the issue at 6.85 percent after initially launching the trade at a price guidance 7 percent.This tighter yield reflects the continued confidence that the international investors have placed in the sovereign bond issuance of Sri Lanka.
Shamindra Marcelline, Head of Financial Institutions Group and Public Sector for HSBC Sri Lanka said, This landmark transaction is the sovereigns largest ever bond offering and clearly marks another significant achievement by the sovereign, especially given the global headwinds in the financial markets and it clearly reiterates the confidence placed by the international investor community in the countrys strong credit story.

The government was contemplating the imposition of a fine on Tamil Nadu for the damages done to the underwater marine life and the pollution caused by its fishermen the Sri Lankan fisheries industry, Subject Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said today.
Minister of Fisheries Mahinda Amaraweera was speaking at a media briefing held this morning.
The Minister said the government had decided to take the issue up directly with the Central Government of India. We have hold discussions directly with the Indian Central Government as we dont see any point in having a dialogue with Tamil Nadu as the boats which encroach into our waters are owned by South Indian politicians and their supporters, he said.
He said the talks between the Sri Lankan and the Indian fishermen, which had been going on following the request made by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had been suspended as nothing fruitful came out of it.
According to the minister 54 South Indian boats and 120 Indian fishermen were presently being held in remand custody and that the Indian government had requested that that these fishermen be released. (Yohan Perera)Video by Nuwan

SL govt living up to its commitment-US
	
		 		 
		 
			
While strongly criticizing the previous Rajapaksa government in Sri Lanka, US Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power said that the new Sri Lankan government moved swiftly to show it was serious about living up to its commitments, from stopping harassment of human rights defenders and journalists, to exposing rampant corruption.
The incumbent Rajapaksa administration had governed largely through divisiveness and fear, and it had persecuted critics, Power said at the Open Government Partnership Global Summit in Mexico City, October 28.
 the challenger Sirisena ran on a platform of open government, anti-corruption and reconciliation, she said, adding that, the new government moved swiftly to show it was serious about living up to its commitments. The impact was immediate. A labor organizer who had gone into hiding during the Rajapaksa administration's rule resumed his work, saying he no longer feared being targeted for what he was doing. A journalist who had been routinely harassed for his reporting said, "the fear has gone."
She also said, but in many ways, that was the easy part. Because walking the walk of open government means not only refraining from muzzling one's critics and refraining from stealing public resources, but finding ways to empower citizens so they can use their greater freedom to shape the government they want. And that's why it's so encouraging that, at the same time it's confronting some of the darkest and most painful chapters in its country's past, the Sirisena administration is also pursuing initiatives to open itself up to greater scrutiny. An access to information law is currently being considered in parliament; Sri Lanka's information technology agency is working to bring connectivity to marginalized communities, who too often have lacked access and the information it provides; and, today, Sri Lanka has joined OGP, one of several new members.
The experience of Sri Lanka, I think, embodies so much of what is at stake in this enterprise. It shows us the profound costs of impunity and corruption. It shows how a determined and persistent civil society that would not give up can swing the pendulum back toward greater accountability and transparency. And it shows how much leaders can achieve, even in a short period of time, when they are willing to engage the people they serve.
She also said that that the Sirisena government has a lot to learn from the fellow governments of OGP. Just as we will have a lot to learn from it. As Sri Lankan civil society asserts an increasingly active role in shaping its government's actions, one of its greatest resources will be the counsel of the civil society organizations in this room. And this is a tremendous resource that just a few years ago did not exist, for a government making a transition like Sri Lanka is attempting.
Ms Power also held talks with Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe and Deputy Foreign Minister Harsha de Silva on the sidelines of the event.

	A scientist attached to the Astronomy Section of the Institute told the Daily Mirror that the latest reports had indicated that the object was expected to fall into deep sea.
	However, he said the exact spot, which the object would fall, could be determined only in a few days time ahead of its re-entry.
	He said it could be harmful only if fell on land.
	The object will start burning once it enters the earths atmosphere and burning fragments if fell on land could be hazardous, he said.
	International media reported on Tuesday that the object, which is about three to six feet in diameter may fall on the on the southern tip of the island of Sri Lanka.
	There was speculation as to what the object could be and expected to be an asteroid, space junk or a part of a space craft but now the scientists are more bent towards accepting that the object is a man-made object. (Yohan Perera)

Video: Kondaya's lawyers violated professional ethics: Police
	
Police Spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara yesterday said that they would file a lawsuit in the Supreme Court against lawyers Udul Premaratne and two others for spreading malicious lies, violating the ethics guiding the law profession.
Referring to statements made by the three lawyers, including Mr. Premaratne against the police, CID and the police spokesman in defence of Dunesh Priyashantha alias Kondaya, ASP Gunasekara said the police were having discussions on whether to proceed with legal action against them.
No lawyer can influence or force a person to file lawsuits in court according to the laws and regulations of the Supreme Court. Mr. Premaratne has claimed that 'Kondaya' had made a statement to the Negombo Magistrate about several assaults inflicted on him by the police, which is not true. 'Kondaya' was never produced in the Negombo Magistrates Court. Mr. Premaratne is engaged in a media stunt, he told a news conference yesterday.
He said bringing Kondaya to media conferences was unacceptable and that holding news conferences with those who have committed crime would set a bad precedent. He pointed out that Mr. Premaratne had claimed that there were no criminal charges or cases, inclusive of child abuse cases, against Kondaya.
In 2010, two cases were filed against the suspect for attempting to abduct a 15-year-old girl after forcibly entering a house in Bemmulla. However, he had been found guilty in 2013 and was sentenced to 20 months imprisonment, suspended for five years, he said.
ASP Gunasekara said anyone can go to the Human Rights Commission or complain to the Independent Police Commission. However, it was not acceptable to white wash someone who had committed such crimes, he said. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Police spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said today that the police had used minimal force to disperse the students who had protested aggressively on the main road.
Commenting on today's incident at the Town Hall in Colombo 7, where a clash broke out during a protest march organised by the Inter Higher National Diploma in Accountancy Conservation Students' Unity, he said the police had used the least possible force -- using batons to disperse the protesting students.
Police can use minimum force to disperse an illegal gathering or any demonstration which disturbs the peace. First they use batons, and if they still can't control the situation they can use tear gas or water cannon, he said.
Hundreds of students took part in the protest, which lasted for hours, urging the authorities to reintroduce the degree equivalent to the Higher National Diploma in Accountancy.
The anti riot squad, which was called in, used water cannon and tear gas on the students as they attempted to forcibly enter the University Grants Commission building.
ASP Gunasekara said if anyone was injured, he or she could resort to legal action.
Thirty nine university students were arrested, and seven persons, including a policeman, were injured during the clash. Police said two monks and five female students were among those arrested. They were to be produced in the Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court tomorrow.(Darshana Sanjeewa and Chathuranga Pradeep)

Space object should pose no danger to SL-Dr. Jayaratne
	
	A space object, now better known as WTF1190F, would not cause any damage in Sri Lanka, Senior Lecturer in Physics, University of Colombo and Consultant on Astronomy and Space Science, Arthur C Clarke Institute for Modern Technologies, Dr. Chandana Jayaratne, said yesterday.
	Dr. Jayaratne told Daily Mirror that in all probability the object would just explode in the air before hitting earth.The object will probably explode in the air and burn out before it reaches the earths surface and therefore there is no need to panic, he said.
	He however warned that the location at which the object was expected to make landfall could change. The movement of space objects of this nature can be unpredictable as none of the fears mentioned by scientists in the past with regards to such objects had come true, he said.
	Meanwhile a media release from the Arthur C Clarke Institute for Modern Technologies said they had still not identified the origin of the object or what it really was. (Yohan Perera)
