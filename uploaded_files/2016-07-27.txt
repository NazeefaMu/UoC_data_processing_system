A shadow cast on Shadow Cabinet
	
The former strongman who was designated as the Prime Minister of the Shadow Cabinet ?appointed? by the Joint Opposition (JO) resigned his ?new office? saying what he really suggested was appointment of shadow monitoring MPs for various Ministries. He also took exception to appointing the so-called Shadow Cabinet even without consulting the seniors of the group.?
Meanwhile, the choice of ?Ministers? for the various portfolios has caused heart-burn to some ?Ministers?. ?For instance, a certain fair Diyawanna member who served as a senior Minister in several SLFP-led governments in the past had expressed her deep disappointment for being assigned a relatively unimportant portfolio. Meanwhile, some others had expressed their reservations about the young man from the former royal family being given the External Affairs portfolio.
Meanwhile, the former strongman is said to have chanced upon the real reason behind creating an unnecessary problem by introducing this Shadow Cabinet. So this Cabinet appointed on the initiative of a JO ?pundit? is destined to die a natural death, they say.
In response, the former strongman said: ?I can?t give names! All I can say that this government has outdone J.R.!??

A tribute to the two at the top
	
The Big Boss recently paid a private visit to the land of our last colonial master.?
Incidentally, he had earlier issued strict instructions to his aides to ensure that no public funds were spent on any matter connected with his visit.
After attending to the purpose of his visit, the Big Boss decided to take a brief holiday in this foreign land. So he took a small cottage on rent and took a taxi to go shopping.?
The big man visited several shopping malls and queued up like an ordinary customer to pay the bill at the counter. He came across several compatriots as well while being outside the malls looking around to hail a taxi, they say.?
On hearing all about the foreign private visit of the Big Boss, a senior purohita remarked: ?Sri Lanka is fortunate that the country?s twosome at the top don?t use their privileges of office to meet their private ends!?

It was expected to be a grand show. A well-known convention hall in the city was packed to capacity with the audience waiting all agog to enjoy the likes of ?Lemon Tree?, ?Ruby Mountain?, and the other ?All Time Hits? by yesteryear?s celebrity Singer Trini Lopez.?
However, the mood changed and soon after the fans seemed to be gripped in a feeling of unease.
The uneasy calm remained until the compere welcoming the distinguished guests mentioned the name of the senior purohita who was the guest of honour when a section of the audience broke out into a loud chorus of booing!
The booing continued intermittently when the audience found the performance of both the aged singer and the musical group was far below expectations. Adding insult to injury, the poor air-conditioning left the audience sweating and suffocating.
The fans who had anticipated a much better musical evening soon began leaving the hall utterly disappointed and disgusted.

Ceylinco General Insurance introduces comprehensive natural disaster cover for traders and homes
	
CEO Ajith Gunawardena?
Ceylinco General Insurance announced recently a comprehensive natural disaster cover for traders and homeowners, enabling traders to cover their property, including buildings and stocks, along with the home and its valuable contents, in the case of home owners.
Ceylinco General Insurance Chief Executive Officer Ajith Gunawardena speaking on the company?s latest initiative, said, ?Recently, we have seen natural disasters occurring more often than in the past. It is not an easy task to predict them and you cannot avoid them either. The best thing you could do is to take an insurance cover that would compensate you fully in the event an unfortunate incident happens.?
That?s why we reintroduced two of our products, with a key focus on natural disasters. Through our ?Traders Disaster Relief Insurance? and ?Homeowners Disaster Relief Insurance?, we cover loss or damage to the insured property due to floods, tsunamis, earthquakes, storms, cyclones, tidal waves, tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons, thunderstorms, hailstorms, windstorms, etc.,? he said.
?This is in addition to the host of other benefits we offer in our Traders Disaster Relief Insurance, such as fire and lightning and burglary for the building and stocks, together with relocation expenses, public liability, workmen?s compensation, cash in drawer, money in transit, business loan repayment cover, personal accident to employees, natural death and personal accident cover to the insured and funeral expenses cover for the insured and family.?
Similarly, in the Home Owners Disaster Relief cover too, a host of other benefits are included, such as fire and lightning, burglary, house-breaking and theft, bursting or overflowing of water tanks, accidental breakage of fixed glasses and mirrors, electrical fire damages and damages due to riots, strikes and civil commotions for the building and contents and other covers such as workmen?s compensation, public liability and personal accident to insured and spouse, etc.,? he added.
Ceylinco General Insurance paid compensation to over 2,300 of their customers, amounting to Rs.2.9 billion for property and vehicles damaged during the recent floods, in May 2016. Claims were paid within a period of 14 days, enabling customers to return to normalcy in the fastest possible time.?
Some of these customers had insured their vehicles, but not their homes, while some had insured the shop, but not the house. However, Ceylinco General Insurance, looking at the situation from a humane angle, decided to pay a percentage of the uninsured damages as well. Even during the tsunami in 2004, Ceylinco General Insurance had a similar approach and paid the claims of those who didn?t have a cover for such disasters.

Foreign judges- My decision will prevail: MS
	
Amid different shades of opinion being expressed on the involvement of foreign judges in the proposed judicial mechanism to inquire into allegations of human rights and accountability issues, President Maithripala Sirisena is reported to have said his decision would prevail at the end.
At a meeting with Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) MPs in the joint opposition, Kandy District MP Keheliya Rambukwella pointed out that though President Sirisena was opposed to foreign judges, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera said something different.
?There are different voices in the government. We do not know whose views are to be believed,? he said.
A United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) resolution adopted on October 1, 2015, called for the setting up of a judicial mechanism made up of foreign judges.
The President said he held talks with foreign leaders and UN Human Rights Chief Zeid Ra?ad Al Hussein. He said he had taken a stand on this matter and it won't be changed at any cost but however, he declined to outline his decision on the matter. (Kelum Bandara)

Man walks away with island resort in $49 raffle
	
An Australian man has won the raffle of a lifetime, taking home an entire Pacific island resort for the price of a $49 ticket.
The man, identified only as Joshua from New South Wales, won The Kosrae Nautilus Resort in a contest organized by Australian owners, Doug and Sally Beitz.
The pair set the business up over two decades ago, after opting to chuck in their 9-to-5 lifestyles and relocate their young family to the tropical island of Kosrae in Micronesia.
With their children now grown and having kids of their own, the pair decided it was time to return to the Australian mainland so they could spend more time with their expanding family.
"We feel like a new chapter in our lives is beginning, and we're ready to pass the baton to someone else," said co-owner Doug Beitz. "We've had our time in the sun and enjoyed a career most people would never even dare dream about, but our current goal now is to become professional grandparents."
The couple didn't simply want to sell their island paradise off to the highest bidder, however.
Instead, they opted to make the resort affordable to everyone, in the hope that their island home would go to someone who was genuinely passionate about island life and respected the ecosystem, rather than the person with the deepest pockets.
According to the company's website, the business is debt free, profitable and already fully staffed.
In the draw Tuesday, it was revealed that the winning ticket of the 16-room resort was number 44,980.
Before the draw took place, Doug had some very simple advice for lucky winner Joshua.

NDBIB crowned ?Sri Lanka?s Best Investment Bank 2016? by Euromoney for 5th consecutive year

?
NDB Investment Bank (NDBIB), which completed a record-breaking year in 2015 raising a mammoth Rs.60 billion, was awarded ?Sri Lanka?s Best Investment Bank 2016? by the prestigious Euromoney magazine.?
This marks the fifth consecutive year NDBIB has been bestowed with this highly acclaimed award. The award was presented at a gala event held at Island Shangri-La Hotel in Hong Kong attended by regional and global heavyweights in the banking industry.
NDBIB has won global acclaim for uplifting standards and setting the benchmark for investment banking in Sri Lanka and is the first and only investment bank in the country to have been recognized by the prestigious Euromoney magazine.
NDBIB CEO Darshan Perera stated, ?Being awarded as the best for five times in a row tells that we have been doing something more than being market leaders for equity, debt and M&A transactions. I believe it proves that we have built a culture of excellence and ingrained it in the DNA of our team. Recruiting the best people, training, retaining and providing continuous challenges to them create a virtuous cycle which automatically brings client satisfaction, successful execution and innovation.?
NDBIB achieved an unassailable 55 percent share of the debenture market in 2015 and co-managed the largest IPO to take place during the year. The latter raised Rs.750 million closing on the first day itself with healthy participation from institutional investors whilst achieving an oversubscription of 6.9 times, showcasing NDBIB?s placement capabilities amidst the rising interest rate environment. NDBIB also experienced a healthy year in terms of M&A activity having advised on two transactions valued at approximately US $ 33 million.?
The highlight amongst M&A transactions was the joining of forces between two fast-growing apparel companies, Hela Clothing and Foundation Garments, where NDBIB was involved right from originating the idea and creating a merger opportunity up to closure of the transaction. The idea was originated after having closely studied both parties? complementary strengths in terms of clientele, markets and product portfolio and common growth aspirations.
NDBIB COO Kaushini Laksumanage commented, ?This award speaks volumes for the great lengths we go to ensure the highest quality of standards and service that we maintain in all our transactions. We take great pride in being recognised by Euromoney for the fifth consecutive year mainly due to our deep and diverse expertise and quest for continuous innovation.?
She also reiterated the significance of the achievement amidst volatile market conditions, particularly during a year with two national elections.
During 2015, NDBIB also acted as financial advisor and arranger to a syndicated loan facility to finance a luxury resort project in the Maldives among its other debt raising initiatives. A consortium of local banks was assembled together with an overseas bank for this purpose. Furthermore, NDBIB?s advisory expertise was sought by Resus Energy who undertook an exercise to restructure its balance sheet in order to unlock shareholder value via a leveraging and share repurchase exercise.
The corporate culture at NDBIB is driven by the highest ethical standards with honesty and integrity as its hallmarks. NDBIB adheres to strict compliance and ethical guidelines, including CFA Code of Conduct, an internal policy framework for compliance and industry best practices.
Euromoney?s Awards for Excellence recognise institutions that demonstrate leadership, innovation and momentum in global financial markets. The accolades cover more than 20 global product categories and include best-in-class awards in all regions and recognitions for the best banks in close to 100 countries.
NDBIB is the investment banking subsidiary of NDB Capital Holdings, the largest full service investment banking group in the country holding a complementary business portfolio consisting of fee-based and fund-based investment banking, wealth management, managing private equity and stockbroking.

Singapore to shame other errant banks after 1MDB saga
	
AFP: Singapore?s Central Bank chief vowed on Monday to name and shame other banks engaged in money-laundering after a scandal involving Malaysian state fund 1MDB hurt the city-state?s financial reputation.
The money-laundering lapses uncovered during a 15-month investigation into fund flows linked to 1MDB are ?simply unacceptable?, Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) Managing Director Ravi Menon told a press briefing.?
?There is no doubt that the recent findings have made a dent on our reputation as a clean and trusted financial centre,? he said.?
At the time of the transactions, it was not apparent to financial regulators worldwide that the fund flows were illicit, he said, adding that clues only started to emerge in 2014 -- some four years after the earliest transactions.?
MAS began investigations in 2015, Menon said, declining to comment further because of continuing probes.
The MAS, which regulates the financial sector and also functions as Singapore?s Central Bank, said it would be stepping up enforcement.?
While previous regulatory dealings with errant financial institutions were kept confidential, Menon said some of them would now be named in public, especially in areas concerning money-laundering and terrorism financing.?
?We are beginning to take a different tack because I think naming and shaming hurts them more than financial penalties,? he said.?
In a joint statement with the police and the Attorney-General?s Chambers last week, the MAS revealed it had seized nearly US $ 180 million in assets through investigations into 1MDB. Half of these were linked to Low Taek Jho, a Malaysian businessman and a close family friend of embattled Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak.?
It came one day after the US Justice Department moved to seize more than US $ 1 billion in assets allegedly bought with money stolen from 1MDB.
Singapore in May kicked out Switzerland?s BSI Bank over ?gross misconduct? linked to 1MDB.?
Swiss financial regulators later dissolved the bank for similar reasons.
Singapore authorities last week also said investigations found that Singapore-based DBS Bank, Standard Chartered Bank?s Singapore Branch and Swiss-based UBS had exhibited ?undue delay in detecting and reporting suspicious transactions?.?
It also noted lapses by Swiss bank Falcon PBS, saying it was still investigating them.
An ex-BSI banker and another man have been charged in a Singapore court with various offences and several others are being questioned.

Story behind young celeb?s haircut
	
Young Diyawanna member from the former royal family had an unusual experience during his recent brief stay at the Welikada state lodge.?
When the young member was released on bail, his intimates were surprised to find his good head of hair reduced to a crew cut. So they asked what became of his long hair when he was in the state lodge.?
So the young one narrated how he came to sport a crew cut. There is an inmate at Welikada who has specialized as a hair dresser. When he met the young member from the famous family, he asked the latter: ?Sir, your hair has grown too long. What about a haircut??
However, the young celeb was not keen on getting a haircut. Hair dresser inmate was not a person who was prepared to take ?no? for an answer. ?When you leave this place ? it might happen soon ? I am going to miss a life-time privilege of giving a haircut to a VIP like you! So let me give you a fine haircut?I assure I?ll do a superb job!? And the inmate pulled out a pair of scissors and a comb, had the young man seated on a bench nearby and proceeded to cut his hair.
The young celeb was quite pleased with the haircut. And he regretted that he had no money to give him as his fee. However, he offered the man a bright prospect by way of consolation. ?When you get your release from this place, come and cut my hair on a regular basis.? And that greatly cheered up the inmate, they say.?

The secretarial one ousted from public administration, now in a sulk is said to be planning to go on retirement. The two authorities in the highest echelons had held out a consolation position to the unhappy white collar high-up, but it has failed to cheer him up, they say.
Meanwhile, the finger of accusation for his transfer which amounts to a demotion has been directed at a holder of a very high office in yahapalanaya who is described as a master-manipulator.
The accusation stems from a story doing the rounds which says that the ousted secretarial one had in his custody documentation relating to an underhand transaction involving about Rs.200 million carried out when a certain housing complex in Colombo 7 was purchased by the government for the high office holders in public service. And the move to axe the secretarial one is closely linked to his being privy to the alleged underhand transaction. ??

Was their statement no news for newsmen?
	
A member of the former royal family was ordered into remand custody quite recently. ?The JO group also attended the hearing of this case. When the group walked out of the court house it occurred to them that this was an ideal occasion to make a hard-hitting statement against the government. They waited for media personnel to approach them, but the latter ignored their presence.
Johnny from Kurunegala realizing that it was a case of the mountain having to go to Muhammed walked up to the news guys and addressed them: ?Mallila, we wish to give a statement to the media about this case of injustice.? However, newsmen paid no heed to his request. ?When Johnny repeated his request, they said: ?Sorry. Not now. We have to make a dash to cover another event.? And they hurried away while Johnny helplessly looked on.
