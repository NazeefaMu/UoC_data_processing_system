Govt. takes credit for our projects- MR
	
The government was deliberately delaying the implementation of the development projects proposed by the UPFA government so that it could later claim that the projects were its own, alleged former president Mahinda Rajapaksa today.
Addressing a group of journalists at Weerawila, he said the government was attempting to claim the ownership of such development projects but that the people knew who was really responsible for them.
He was referring to a visit to Hambantota by the Prime Minister to inspect the work begun on an industrial park by a Chinese firm. "This is something we proposed but could not launch it because of the government change. The government keeps delaying this and other projects and then launches them thinking the people have forgotten whose projects they were," he said.
Mr. Rajapaksa also said that though the government criticised the Hambantota Port and Airport, both proved to be essential today." It takes time for such big projects to generate income," he said. (Sanath Desmond)

IT sector will not be affected by ETCA
	
Sri Lankan professionals, especially in the Information Technology sector, would not be affected by the proposed Economic and Technological Cooperation Agreement (ETCA), Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Dr. Harsha de Silva said.
Deputy Minister de Silva said that the Indian IT professionals would not be given an opportunity of opening up their businesses in Sri Lanka under the agreement.
He assured that Indian professionals would not become threat to local IT professionals under the agreement
He said international service trade has four modes.
Three of these modes are, namely, cross border trade, consumption abroad and commercial persons are already taking place in Sri Lanka and that covers the IT sector as well, he said.
"The opposition to the agreement arises from the fear that it will allow the fourth mode of service trade, presence of a natural person.
However, this is not discussed under the agreement, de Silva said.
Therefore, Indian IT professionals would not be able to threaten Sri Lankan jobs, he said.
