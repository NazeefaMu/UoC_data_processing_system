Dilan uncertain over his resignation
	
Refuting media reports that he would resign of his current minister post, State Minister of Housing and Samurdhi Dilan Perera yesterday said that such decision has not been made but he was uncertain to resign in the future over some personal reasons.
As he was satisfied with what he got from President Maithripala Sirisena, Mr. Perera said at the moment he is working together with the Cabinet Minister of Housing and Samurdhi Sajith Premadasa without any issue.
?Only because I?ve got a state minister post it is not a reason for me to resign over. Though I have some personal reasons I cannot reveal them as they are personal. No one can predict future. So, I don?t know whether I will resign over my personal issues or not,? Mr. Perera said.
Some media reports said that Mr. Perera is worried due to his not being given a cabinet ministerial position, not being invited for the discussion between President Sirisena and former president Rajapaksa.
As a result of disappointments of ministers, the media report also said Ministers Pavitra Wanniarachchi and C.B. Ratnayake will also resign from the government soon. (Piyumi Fonseka)

MS stresses on reconciliation
	
President Maithripala Sirisena today pledged not to allow terrorism to raise its head again and leave no room for crisis that could lead to a conflict.
?Though the physical development in the war torn areas were accelerated, there was no proper mechanism to improve the reconciliation. The mission of the new Government is to boost the development and also to improve reconciliation,? the President told the Remembrance Day ceremony held in Matara.
He said: ?After the war victory, efforts were taken only to develop physical resources such as infrastructure, buildings and transport.
Unfortunately, in the post-conflict era no one took the pains to rebuild the shattered souls and minds of the people and a genuine re-conciliation process was absent. Nevertheless, the new government will give priority to reconciliation and development.
?When we direct attention to criticism levelled against the government by our political adversaries, it is quite clear that extremism is still strong and active. Those who attempt to create division and mistrust among communities are operating in Sri Lanka and in many other countries freely. Therefore, the government is committed to negate the charges levelled against the government while strengthening the armed forces and making it robust and security centered.
The Remembrance Day or Ranaviru Commemorative Day marks the restoration of peace and the protection of our territorial integrity and our national heritage after wiping out the menace of separatist terrorism from Sri Lanka?s soil. All Sri Lankans have suffered immensely from terrorism and the people are well aware of its horrors. Terrorism is a tool that suppresses humanity and truth. It sheds blood and destroys peace and the loss of tens of thousands of lives. The country was saved from this mayhem by the Police and the Armed Forces personnel many of whom paid the ultimate sacrifice for their motherland.
From the 1980s to 2009, Sri Lanka and all Sri Lankans faced the dreaded clutches of terrorism. We heard nothing but tragedy after tragedy during this dark period.
Development was at a standstill and very little hope for our people. That is why the police and armed forces personnel who placed their lives at risk to save the country from total destruction deserve the respect and appreciation of the entire nation. Today, we all once against honour and offer our gratitude and respect for what they did for the country.
We would have failed in our duty if we forget to turn the searchlight inwards to identify the causes that led to terrorism in our country and the resultant 30-year war. What we can remember is that the Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims live like one family and treated each other as brothers and sisters. There were true patriots at the time who kept the nation united while all national leaders irrespective of their ethnicity fought for independence in 1948 with the blessings of all communities. But there was no real effort to establish real reconciliation after independence and the final result was that separatist terrorism got the upper hand in this country.But once against we have to ask ourselves whether we have done anything substantial to achieve true reconciliation among all communities after the war victory on May 19, 2009. The answer is a disappointing ?no?.
The circumstances that led to the final battle to save the motherland from terrorism centered on water at Mavil Aru and the concluding victory also achieved on May 19, 2009 was in water at the Nandikadal lagoon. The government will never dodge its responsibility or mitigate the sacrifices made by our war heroes with reconciliation the ultimate target.
The basic requirement to establish reconciliation is to promote trust, confidence and eliminate fear in the minds of all communities. That is why the government gives top priority to promote reconciliation it gives to development.
The government treats the ?Ranaviru Commemoratin Day as an occasion to commemorate all those who lost their lives in the separatist war. We also consider it as the day, on which sustainable peace was re-established in Sri Lanka. The government will do everything possible to rebuild the shattered lives of people and through welfare and social responsibility programmes. The government?s utmost objective is to prevent another war and to improve the living conditions of the people and the government is confident that Sri Lanka will reach that goal sooner than later with unity, trust and mutual respect of all communities.?(Sadun A. Jayasekara)

Construction to go ahead without delay ? Ravi K
	
	The construction work of the Defence Headquarters Complex in Battaramulla would be completed without a delay, and there was no shortage of funds to allocate for the construction, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said today.
	Minister Karunanayake earlier said that the construction of the complex was halted because the entire project needed to be evaluated and the exact estimated cost needed to be clarified.
	When contacted by Daily Mirror yesterday, he said that there was no update on the evaluation of the project as yet. ?Still nothing,? he said.
	The Minister said that the funds for the project are being released through the Treasury and rejected the reports that the funds reserved for the construction expenses of the Defence Headquarters were being spent to pay the salaries of State employees.
	He also denied that the Army was carrying out the construction of the project through their funds. ?This is not true. The Army is not funding the construction and the project will be completed without a delay,? he said.
	Earlier, Rs. 8 billion was transferred to the Treasury from an account maintained by former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa for the construction purpose of this complex. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

House Leader Lakshman Kiriella said the government, while accepting the Supreme Court ruling staying the arrest of former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, it had every right to criticise the flaws in the judicial system.
He said it was a misconception that court rulings could not be criticised in the public domain.?Mr. Kiriella expressed these views in response to Opposition Leader Nimal Siripala de Silva who was critical of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe?s comments on the court ruling.?
Mr. de Silva claimed that the Prime Minister had openly challenged the court ruling and this amounted to a serious assault on the independence of the Supreme Court.
He said the Prime Minister's remarks were baseless and pointed out that it was all the more serious to submit a ruling by Sri Lanka's highest court to the Commonwealth Judges' Association.?
Mr. de Silva asked whether the government accepted the jurisdiction of two judges hearing a fundamental rights application.?Mr. Kiriella said the Prime Minister would provide a detailed reply on the following day.?
He said any person had the right to criticise court rulings and that he regretted the opposition leader, who is also a lawyer by profession disputing or denying this right.?(Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)

Jayalalithaa hints at swearing-in in due course
	
Stating that she was following a carefully planned time-table in accordance with law, AIADMK general secretary Jayalalithaa on Monday indicated that her swearing-in as Chief Minister would take place at the scheduled time and no one could stop it from happening, the Hindu reported.
?What my dear partymen wish for will happen at the scheduled time. No one needs to worry,? she said in a statement here, without using any term that would indicate her return as Chief Minister.
Expressing grief over the death of cadre S. Raja, who fell before a running train to kill himself recently, the former Chief Minister urged party cadre not to become anxious or take hasty decisions going by rumours over the ?time gap? in the AIADMK government blossoming again under her leadership.
The statement comes a day after AIADMK MLA P. Vetrivel, representing Dr. Radhakrishnan Nagar Assembly constituency in Chennai, vacated the seat enabling Ms. Jayalalithaa to contest the by-poll and get elected to the Assembly within six months from the day she is sworn in as Chief Minister.
However, Ms. Jayalalithaa made no mention of her swearing-in in her statement on Monday.
The AIADMK chief also told partymen that it was celebration time as the party was standing at the pinnacle of victory.
?Our politics and governance must adhere to the laws, rules and regulations. We have always functioned that way,? she said.
Emphasising that she was following a carefully thought-out time-table, Ms. Jayalalithaa said, ?There is no confusion or complication.? The party was disciplined and guided by the laws, she said, asking the cadre not to misunderstand and take hasty decisions.
The AIADMK?s political opponents, she said, were envious of the party?s growth and the ?success after success? that came its way and were indulging in rumour-mongering.Ms. Jayalalithaa announced a solatium of Rs 3 lakh to the family of Mr. Raja from party funds.

JVP like a bell on an elephant: Somawansa
	
	The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) is like a bell hung on the United National Party (UNP) elephant and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake looks like an actor performing in the political theatre, former JVP leader Somawansa Amarasinghe said today.
	He urged the present group of JVP leaders to resign and allow other party members to come to the forefront.
	Mr. Amarasinghe said the JVP was now fulfilling needs of the UNP and not that of the people as it did earlier.
	He told a media briefing that even though many considered him to be a patient and foolish, he was still in a superior position to fight with any politician despite his age.
	?They call me a patient now. It is true that I am old. But, I sacrificed my life for the JVP for thirty three years. I am still strong. I challenge those who insult me to compete with me any time,? Mr. Amarasinghe said.
	Responding to a journalist, he said he would never re-join the JVP which he described as a garbage dump.
	Speaking about the Election Day coup that is alleged to have taken place under the supervision of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, Mr. Amarasinghe said the conspiracy to remove President Sirisena was still active. Therefore, he along with his party members will organise an ?Anti-Conspiracy Walk? demanding the President Sirisena?s security was enhanced.
	?If the President dies or is inactive the parliament will select a person with the majority?s choice for the Presidency. As everyone knows, then the corrupted lost leader will come into power. We won?t let it happen,? Mr. Amarasinghe said.
	Meanwhile, Mr. Amarasinghe said he would launch a new party soon after their first conference is held next month.
	He said several trade unions will join him in setting up the new party. Ceylon Post Officers? Organisation President Jayantha Wijesinghe said the JVP mastermind was unfortunately lost to the JVP because of the fault of the JVP?s present leaders.
	?We have called all who quit the JVP earlier to join us,? Mr. Amarasinghe said. (Piyumi Fonseka)Pix by Pradeep Dilrukshana

Motions against Arjuna and Dilrukshi : No provision- UNP
	
The government yesterday ruled out the possibility of entertaining the motions against Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran and Bribery Commission Director General Dilrukshi Dias Wickramasinghe in Parliament because there was no provision for doing so.
Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella told Daily Mirror that there was no provision to pass votes of no confidence against government officials in Parliament in this manner.
He said Article 55 the Constitution deals with the appointments, promotions, transfers and disciplinary control of public servants and the Monetary Law deals with the appointment and removal of the Central Bank Governor and it was anomalous for the government to bypass its own laws.
He said there were also references to the Prime Minister in these motions and that MPs were barred from making references against each other unless there were substantive motions.?

'Probe how smuggler met Lanka President'
	
	Amid allegations that the fisherfolk group which met Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena recently included a smuggler, the National Fishworkers? Forum (NFF) has demanded that the State, Central, and Sri Lankan governments probe the incident and bring to book the fake fishermen associations.
	?We expect the governments to investigate and come up with a report that would absolve the traditional fishermen from the blame of being smugglers,? said M Ilango, former MLA and chairperson of NFF at a press conference.
	Media reports, time and again, have pointed out that fake fishermen associations both in India and Sri Lanka were fooling both the governments. A heroin stock worth `8 crore was smuggled into Sri Lanka recently by these bogus associations in nexus with spurious forums, he alleged.
	To prevent smuggling of gold and narcotics under the banner of such associations, the governments must initiate stringent action, he said, and added that such activities put a severe strain on the on-going talks.
	Taking a dig at the Centre for filing an affidavit in the Madurai bench of Madras High Court, which stated that fishermen often indulged in smuggling activities after encroaching into Sri Lankan waters, Ilango said the allegations were baseless and unwarranted.
	Over the last one year, there were around 36,000 instances of Indian fishermen crossing over to the other side and 185 boats confiscated and later released by Sri Lanka. Also, of the? 937 fishermen from Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, who were arrested and later released by Lankan Navy, not even one was charged with smuggling, but only that they crossed the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL), he pointed out.
	The NFF also expressed happiness over the acquittal of former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa in the disproportionate assets case. She had initiated several measures to resolve problems faced by traditional fisher communities of Tamil Nadu, Ilango said.(Indian Express)
