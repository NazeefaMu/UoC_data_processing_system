Chinese workers in BIA project nabbed with Rs. 6m worth of fags
	
Four Chinese workers attached to the runway renovation project at the Bandaranaike International Airport were nabbed by Customs while attempting to smuggle some Rs.6 million worth of foreign cigarettes into the country.
They were checked when attempting to use the 'green channel'.
Customs Deputy Director Parakrama Basnayake said the Chinese were searched on suspicion and the cigarettes found in their baggage.
He said they had 600 cartons of two Chinese brands of cigarettes with each carton valued at Rs.10,000.
The suspects worked for a private construction firm handling the renovation of the runway.
This has been the second biggest detection of smuggled cigarettes at the BIA this year since the arrest of a Chinese woman on February 12 when she attempted to smuggle into the country 300 cartons of Chinese cigarettes worth Rs.3 million.
Mr. Basnayake said the 300 cartons of cigarettes was said to have been for the use of Chinese labourers engaged in various construction projects in Colombo.
?There is a high demand for Chinese cigarettes among Chinese workers, but we cannot allow them to bring in foreign cigarettes, because the import of tobacco products is banned,? he said.
One of the suspects who admitted to having brought the contraband was fined Rs.100,000.
Customs Superintendents Jagath Pushpakumara and Ananda Rathnakumara made the detection on the instructions of Mr. Basnayake.
The contraband was confiscated and the Chinese workers released. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

CMA seeks int?l support over full face helmet ban
	
The Ceylon Motorcyclists? Association (CMA) on Friday complained to the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund?s (UNICEF) Sri Lanka office and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) citing that the recent gazette issued by the government imposing a full face helmet ban had restricted the motorcyclists? right to safety.
Writing to the UNICEF State Representative Tim Sutton and the IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde, CMA had noted that the government had failed to provide a solution to the matter which they were originated.
CMA Secretary Chirantha Amarasinghe told the Daily Mirror that they decided to complain to the UNICEF as the ban would result in the reduction of importation of helmets for children, risking their lives.
He also said they wanted to point out to the IMF the money that is going to be wasted in the form of treatment to the victims of accidents due to the ban.
Amarasinghe alleged that President Maithripala Sirisena?s silent policy on the matter had aggravated the situation.
?We have brought the matter to the President?s notice soon after the new gazette was issued, but little action has been taken regarding it,? he said.
?In a study conducted by the Police Department on the Motorcyclists' deaths in the year 2014, it was reported that no motorcycle users with full face helmets had died from head injuries whereas 457 out of 569 (69%) with open face helmets had died from head injuries,? he claimed.

JO creating campaign of lies: UNP
	
By holding a news conference in a vehicle park near the entrance to Parliament, the joint opposition is attempting to create a misconception that the government was depriving the JO of its political freedom, the United National Party (UNP) said yesterday.
UNP MP Harshana Rajakaruna told a media briefing that the JO members were desperately attempting to show that it was being deprived of its proper status in Parliament.
?The JO has said it was forced to hold the news conference in the vehicle park because it was not permitted to do so inside Parliament. There is a procedure to allocate a committee room in Parliament for a discussion,? he said.
Mr. Rajakaruna said it was not easy to make such allocations and that those rooms were available only for the use of cabinet ministers or party leaders. He said the JO was continuing its campaign of lies to give a wrong impression to the people.
Referring to the parliamentary session at which joint opposition leader Dinesh Gunawardane was suspended from attending parliamentary proceedings for one week, Mr. Rajakaruna said this was the first time in parliamentary history that such a thing had happened.
?MP Gunawardane has tarnished the image of Parliament by behaving in such a despicable manner,? he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Rangana Herath leads SL to victory
	
Sri Lanka cricket team?s Rangana Herath became the most successful left-arm spinner in test cricket on Saturday, claiming six for 59 to bowl his team to an emphatic 259-run victory against Bangladesh national cricket team in the first Test at the Galle International Stadium.
Leading the side in the absence of injured regular skipper Angelo Mathews, Herath mowed down the Bangladesh middle and lower order as the tourists, chasing a mammoth 457-run victory target, collapsed for 197 an hour after the lunch break.
Bangladesh began the final day needing 390 runs for an improbable win at a ground where no team has scored more than 300 in the fourth innings. They received an early jolt, losing opener Soumya Sarkar to the second delivery of the day.
Sarkar could not add to his overnight score of 53 and was bowled by Asela Gunaratne and the tourists kept losing wickets regularly.
Bangladesh captain Mushfiqur Rahim (34) joined forces with Liton Das (35) to hold off Sri Lanka?s victory charge for 19-odd overs before the wheels came off.
Herath struck twice in the 27th over, dismissing Shakib Al Hasan and Mahmudullah in the space of three balls to equal New Zealander Daniel Vettori?s 362 test wicket mark.
Herath, who turns 39 on March 19, dismissed Liton to enter the record books and went on to complete a nine-wicket match haul which took his tally to 366 in 79 matches. (Hindustan Times)

Russians scientists reveal plan to restore part of Arctic Siberia to its Ice Age condition
	
Over the years, the trees at Pleistocene Park have been flattened using ?powerful tank-like vehicles. But, in order to keep the trees from taking ?over again, the ambitious plans call for the services of hundreds of ?thousands of woolly mammoths
?
?
At a 50-square mile nature reserve tucked ?deep in Arctic Siberia, scientists are working on a radical plan to ?fight climate change by reviving the ancient grasslands of the last Ice ?Age ? and the beasts that once roamed them.
While ?this period is better known for the glaciers that swathed the ?continents until 12,000 years ago, the grasslands of the Mammoth Steppe ?ecosystem also dominated much of?
the surface.
Researchers ?at Pleistocene Park are attempting to reintroduce wild herbivores and ?even resurrect woolly mammoths to revert Beringia to a grassy landscape ?that absorbs less heat than the forests there today, in efforts to stop ?the thawing of Siberia?s permafrost.Arctic permafrost is often said to be a climate change ?ticking time bomb.?
As ?Earth warms and the frozen soil thaws, it threatens to release massive ?amounts of carbon stored within, which could escape in the form of ?carbon dioxide and methane.
In turn, these powerful greenhouse gasses could trigger runaway climate change. Sergey ?Zimov first had the idea to introduce a Mammoth Steppe ecosystem to ?Beringia decades ago, essentially creating a cold-weather version of the ?African savannah, The Atlantic reports.
Pleistocene ?Park, named for an epoch that spanned roughly 2.6 million to 12,000 ?years ago, was founded in 1996, and is now under the control of Sergey?s ?son, Nikita.
It?s thought that the ?grasslands will reflect more sunlight, allowing the winter freeze to ?penetrate deeper into the crust, and cool the soil beneath.
This would slow the melting of the permafrost. ??
?To ?make permafrost colder, all that is needed is to remove heat insulating ?snow cover, and expose the ground to the extreme negative temperatures ?of the Arctic,? the park?s Kickstarter campaign explains in a bid to raise $106,000 for the project.
?In ?the steppe ecosystems, animal density is so high that animals looking ?for forage trample all the snow in the pastures several times?per ?winter.
?This compacts the snow, massively reducing its heat insulating abilities.? Over the years, the trees at the park have been flattened using powerful tank-like vehicles. But, ?in order to keep the trees from taking over again, they?ll need to ?employ hundreds of thousands of woolly mammoths, according to The ?Atlantic.
Scientists are already ?working to resurrect the ancient beasts by editing the genes of the ?Asian elephant, with hopes that natural selection will eventually refine ?their creation ? if they are ever successfully manufactured.
The park is so far home to wild horses, bison, and musk oxen ? all crucial to the grassland ecosystem.
And, it?ll soon need predators.According to The Atlantic, Nikita plans to ?bring in grey wolves, Siberian Tigers, and cold-adapted Canadian ?cougars ? and, if scientists succeed in resurrecting extinct species, ?they may even bring back cave lions and dire wolves.
?For ?an ecosystem to be sustainable it must have large heavy grazers, such ?as elephants, ruminants such as cows and goats, predators such as wolves ?and tigers etc,? the park?s website explains.
These ?ecosystems were extremely stable, the post continues, as ?high animal ?density only allowed grasses to be the dominating vegetation, since only ?grasses can sustain active grazing. ?Shrubs, moss, and trees were either trampled or broken.?

## Title: Samatha - Vipassana or Buddhist meditation?

Samatha - Vipassana or Buddhist meditation?
	
?
Buddha travelled to his hometown Kapilawastu and reached the castle on Medin Poya day, where he was born forty two years before. This visit led to four significant events - attainment of stream entry [Sothapanna] by King Suddhodana and stepmother Prajapathi Gothami; Princess Yasodhara taking refuge in the Buddha Dhamma and Sangha; ordination of his son Rahula and the ordination of cousin brother Prince Nanda. ??
As soon as the message ?Siddhartha Gautama was to arrive at the palace in Kapilawastupura? reached every corner of the city, the surroundings of the palace assumed a pleasant ambiance as citizenry there prepared to celebrate the event, the arrival of their future King Siddhartha ? they knew little about a Buddha. The Sakyan seniors who congregated at the palace, besieged with their natural pride, revealed their reluctance to pay reverence to the Buddha saying; ?He is much younger than us, we are Sakyans.? Only the juniors were sent to perform the rituals, compelling the Buddha to perform a near-miracle [Yama Maha Pelahara] and counter their pride. On this occasion, King Suddhodana (the father of Gautama Buddha) worshiped the Buddha for the third time. ??
The following morning, Buddha, along with a group of monks, went begging for alms. This unusual act by a member of the royal family made the king very unhappy and he rushed to the Buddha and admonished him that begging for food was an ?insult to the clan. The Buddha then reminded the king that this act was normal for the Buddha clan. ? ?O king, please allow me to offer you this treasure of mine which is the Dhamma.? ? ?After the meeting, King Suddhodana invited the Buddha to the palace. The Buddha, along with his chief disciples Sariyuth and Mugalan, went to see his former Princess Yasodhara at her chamber, but she refused to appear before him saying; ?If he has any concern for me, let him act accordingly.? However, on seeing him, she held his feet and sobbed bitterly. The Buddha traced the Samsaric sojourn and explained to her how they had been together in a series of past births. Buddha acknowledged that she had been of great assistance to him until he became Buddha. Her woes were transformed into delight as she heard these utterances. The subsequent day, his son Rahula asked for his legacy from the Buddha. The Buddha had his meal and returned to the temple, Prince Rahula followed. The rest is history. Upon Buddha?s return, he handed over his bowl to Prince Nanda. As was his wish, Nanda was?
also ordained. ??
Dhamma is deep - ?Ghambiro? ??
Acing examinations and listening to people?s erudition will make one knowledgeable, next he or she can pass examinations and become an educated person. But Dhamma is different -- ?The Dhamma that has been realised by me is deep ?Ghambiro,? not easy to see, difficult to awaken to, calm, excellent, outside the realm of doubt, delicate, foreseeable only by the wise? -- Buddha. ??
?Living the Moment? is Buddhist meditation ??
Like the five precepts that existed eons before the birth of Siduhat, we Buddhists mistakenly believe Buddha imposed the Samatha-Vipassana meditation; it was a practice originated in ancient India over three to four millennia ago. They are the two types of meditation that deal with one-pointedness and mindfulness respectively, and are helpful in mind-training and body/mind coordination. Yet, they have nothing to do with the Fourth Noble Truth, the path - ?Magga.? ??
Bare attention to the present moment, devoid of any perceptive thought, is mindful meditation or Satipatthana; what Buddha prescribed. A technique widely-used in meditation classes, retreats and medical institutions in the Western hemisphere is ?Samatha?Vipassana? for its therapeutic value. It is called Mind-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), and is not based on the Satipatthana meditation introduced by the Buddha. The MBCT technique developed by Professor Mark Williams and John Teasdale of Cambridge is used today to treat depression. Clinical trials have confirmed the efficacy and there are statistics to show that it is superior to currently accessible drugs. ??
In Satipatthana or Buddhist meditation, bare attention or mindfulness is watching your mind; your own mind in action, observe it like an outsider. What you see is just what is going on; you observe without trying to change, appreciate or condemn. With condemning, appreciating one cannot observe mindfully. ??
The mind is like your right hand or left hand, it lives with your body. Only that it is hidden and it remains hidden for the entire life. When you observe every twist and turn of the mind, you would start realising what is going on. You would start observing the root of your fears, desires, frustrations and anxiety. ??
Remember, whatever you observe has always been living with you, unseen, all the time. The best way to approach it is with a sense of curiosity to find out what is really going on out there in the field of your mind. Do not just read and create memory of knowledge, use the tools to observe and realise the facts firsthand. Understanding one?s mind would open the door to deeper secrets that are living inside. ??
?
Understanding the basics of human mind?
If you observe properly, you would realise that we are continuously active with something. We all wake up in the morning and get busy until the end of the day. What precisely are we doing? What are we occupied with? The hidden mind is stuck in a complex network of thoughts. Constant practice would make one comprehend the power of the hidden mind that drives our lives with all emotions, actions and quests. ??
Nelson Mandela once addressed his people and said, ?South Africa belongs to all who lives in it, black and white, and no government can justly claim authority unless it is based on the will of the people, that our country will never be prosperous or free until all people live in brotherhood, enjoying equal rights and opportunities and that only a democratic state, based on the will of the people, can secure to all, their birthright without distinction of colour, race, sex or belief.? Ultimately, one is one?s own refuge; no stranger is going to clean up the inner mess we are found in. ? ?
Buddhism is a rational practical and offers a pragmatic view of life and of the world. It does not tempt people into living in a fool?s paradise; it does not scare and agonise people with all kinds of fantasies and guilt. It does not generate religious extremists to disturb the followers of other faiths. Buddhism tells us precisely and objectively what we are and what the world around us is, and explains to us the way to perfect tranquility, liberty, peace and happiness. ??
May all beings be happy! ??

Second referendum on Scottish independence is inevitable: Minister
	
?
(Daily Mail, London), 10 March 2017- A second referendum on Scottish independence is ?inevitable? Government ministers have revealed.
Downing Street believes that it is only a matter of time until Nicola Sturgeon is granted her wish for a second vote on breaking up the Union.
The Scottish First Minister has continued to issue threats over a second referendum following the UK-wide decision to leave the EU last year.
A minister told the Financial Times: ?It?s looking inevitable, I don?t think we?re in any position to stop it happening.??
While a source close to Theresa May?s team said the only debate over a second referendum would be about ?the date?.Sources also say that No10 would try to delay the vote until Britain has left the EU.
However, a poll has showed Scots voters split down the middle on the independence issue.

Sri Lanka is determined to work with the maritime powers of the region and beyond, to ensure that the Indian Ocean is conflict free, Sri Lankan Ambassador to US Prasad Kariyawasam said in Washington on Wednesday.
He expressed these views while addressing a public event hosted by the Hudson Institute, a Washington-based think tank, on ?Sri Lanka, A growing hub in the Indo-Pacific.?
?We are eager to work with the maritime powers of the Indian Ocean and beyond, to make our oceans secure for unimpeded commerce and peaceful navigation. Sri Lanka takes the security of sea lanes and maritime security in the oceans around us, seriously,? he said.
He said Sri Lanka now welcome an increasing number of Navy vessels of major sea powers who regularly call at the country?s ports on goodwill visits.
?In fact, just now as I speak, the US Pacific fleet and its transport vessel USNS Fall River is at Hambantota Port on the first-ever Pacific Partnership goodwill Mission to Sri Lanka, in partnership with the Sri Lanka Navy,? he said.
The Ambassador said Sri Lanka is eager to work in partnership with countries in the region and beyond on humanitarian and disaster relief operations in the region. ?
?We are committed to prevent seaborne conflict, and to combat terrorism and piracy, and assist in harmonizing geo-strategic complexities in the Ocean around our region.? In our view, an ocean based security architecture can be built to ensure a peaceful Indian Ocean, which can be extended towards the Indo-Pacific in time to come,? he said.
Ambassador Kariyawasam said Sri Lanka now stands ready to play its full role as a responsible member of the world community, as a hub nation in the Indo-Pacific that serves its people, the region and the world beyond, for common prosperity.

SL faces drastic drop in hydro-power generation
	
Hydropower generation has dropped to less than 10 percent of the total energy requirement of the country because of the prevailing dry spell, Power and Energy Ministry Spokesman Sulakshana Jayawardane said.
He said 2016 Sri Lanka had the lowest recorded rainfall in ten years and this compelled the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to depend less on hydro power and instead focus on thermal and coal power generation so as to maintain an uninterrupted power supply.
?Under normal circumstances, hydropower makes up for 40 to 50 per cent of the total energy requirement. However, it has now dropped to 10 per cent,? Mr. Jayawardane said. (Kelum Bandara)

SL releases 53 Indian fishermen as goodwill gesture
	
In a goodwill gesture, Sri Lanka on Friday released 53 Indian fishermen lodged in Jaffna Prison, ANI reported yesterday.
More fishermen are expected to be released today from the Vavuniya and Trincomalee jail by the Sri Lankan Government.
The news article said all the fishermen will be sent to India soon.
Earlier on Thursday, Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said that all 85 fishermen, who are in custody of the Sri Lankan Government, would be released soon.
"The Government of Sri Lanka has informed the High Commission of India in Colombo that all 85 Indian fishermen, currently in custody, will be released. We understand that the instructions in this regard to the concerned authorities in Sri Lanka have been issued. We are awaiting further orders within Sri Lanka in this regard," MEA official spokesperson Gopal Bagley told the media.
With regards to the killing of an Indian fisherman allegedly by the Sri Lankan Navy, Bagley said that the High Commission had reached to "the highest possible levels in Colombo" and was assured of "thorough investigation" into the matter.
Earlier this week, a group of Indian fishermen, who were fishing between Danushkodi and Katchatheevu off the Tamil Nadu coast, were allegedly fired upon by the Sri Lankan Navy in which one fisherman was killed.

South Korean president unanimously impeached
	
By Anna Fifield ??
South Korean President Park Geun-hye has been removed from office, with the Constitutional Court unanimously upholding a parliamentary vote to impeach her for her role in a corruption and influence-peddling scandal. ??
Elections for a new president must now be held within 60 days, and polls suggest there will be a change in political direction for South Korea, with the progressive candidate Moon Jae-in holding a strong lead over the conservatives who were once loyal to Park. ??
?The court dismisses President Park Geun-hye from her position,? said Lee Jung-mi, the acting chief justice, delivering the highly anticipated verdict Friday. ?There is no other choice but to decide this verdict.? ??
The decision marks a historic moment in a country that adopted democracy only 30 years ago, with peaceful protest leading to the removal of an elected leader. ?
?
All eight judges on the Constitutional Court voted to uphold the impeachment motion against Park, passed by an overwhelming majority in the National Assembly in December, saying the president had ?continuously? violated the law and Constitution. ??
The court concluded that the president had helped her friend Choi Soon-sil extract bribes from South Korean conglomerates and had personally asked big business for donations. She had leaked confidential documents to Choi, tried to cover up her wrongdoing, then lied about it. The judges also chastised Park for refusing to answer questions about the case. ??

TN fishermen hit SL Navy boat first: claim Indian officials
	
Indian officers investigating the case of the gunning down of a Tamil Nadu fisherman allegedly by Sri Lankan Navy, have claimed that the incident could have been triggered by the Rameswaram fishermen allegedly ramming against the Island Nation Navy?s water scooter or inflatable boat, The Hindu reported yesterday.
It is being claimed that such an incident of ramming occurred when the Sri Lankan Navy had cornered the fishermen who were fishing on the high seas on Monday night. The resultant firing led to the death of a 21-year-old fisherman Britjo.
The circumstances under which the boat dashed the water scooter are unclear. It could have possibly been an accident while trying to sail back. But officials said that since the Sir Lankan Navy or the fishermen concerned were not forthcoming on the exact developments, it has become difficult to come to any conclusion at this stage.
While the Indian fishermen claimed that they were fishing near the ?Sethu kalvai? and fortified their claim with ?GPS reading of 11/28?, investigating officials have countered it and claimed that the fishermen should have been at least six to seven nautical miles inside the Sri Lankan waters, towards Talaimannar when the Navy confronted them.
The Indian fishermen did not immediately hand over the GPS set to the Marine police of the Coastal Security Group (CSG). They handed over the set only after the police exerted pressure through the Fisheries Department, the sources said.
As the situation was volatile in the island with fishermen protesting against the firing incident, the Marine police could not question any of the five fishermen, who were with the deceased fisherman.
Sarone (32), the boat driver who was undergoing treatment at the district headquarters hospital also could not be questioned, police said.
The CSG secured the GPS set after writing to the Deputy Director, Fisheries, but it has no recent data, Superintendent of Police (CSG) R Sakthivel said. It could not be ascertained whether the GPS was the one carried by the victims on Monday night, he said.
The set has been sent to forensic science department in Chennai for analysis. As the set appeared to be sophisticated, experts were exploring whether the erased data could be retrieved, he said. Mobile phone call details of a fisherman on-board the fishing boat and P Sesu Raja, the fishermen leader, who was informed of the firing were also being analysed to ascertain the timing of the alleged shooting, he said.
Apart from the bullet recovered from the body of the deceased, the CSG has also collected splinters from the mechanised boat, blood stained cloth of Britjo, he said, adding the bullet and other materials would be sent to the ballistic division in Chennai for examination after completing the legal formalities here. As the ?wheeling house? of the boat bore the brunt, the shooting should have taken from the range of 50 to 100 metres, police said.

(Daily Mail, London), 9 March 2017 - ? ?A million Vietnamese people are still affected by America?s use of chemical weapons in the 1960s which has left babies suffering painful deformities and mental illness. ??
Hospitals across the country are now caring for children who are suffering the horrific symptoms caused by Agent Orange decades after the attacks during the Vietnam War. ??
Peace Village ward at Tu Du Hospital is home to surviving orphan victims of Agent Orange and an incredible set of photographs shows life inside the ward. ??
Agent Orange is the combination of the code names for Herbicide Orange and Agent LNX, one of the herbicides and defoliants used by the US military as part of its chemical warfare programme, Operation Ranch Hand, during the Vietnam War from 1961 to 1971. ??
Over the course of 10 years, American forces sprayed nearly 20million gallons of the chemical in Vietnam, Laos and parts of Cambodia in an effort to deprive guerrilla fighters of cover by destroying plants and trees where they could find refuge. ??
The chemical was manufactured for the US Department of Defence by Monsanto Corporation and Dow Chemical. ??
