Challenges lie ahead for National Govt-MS
	
The national unity government formed by the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) may face lot of challenges that have to be overcome with diligence, President Maithripala Sirisena said today.
Speaking at a ceremony held to mark the 69th anniversary of the United National Party (UNP) at Sirikotha today, Mr. Sirisena said the cooperation that had emerged in the leadership level of the SLFP and the UNP should also go down to grass-root level of the respective parties in order to win the challenges before them for the sake of the country.
?Don?t think the enemies are weak as there are pro-Eelam forces on one hand while forces belonging to the last regime are also waiting to sabotage the destiny of the national government,? he said.
The President also said that he decided to come out of the previous government and become the common opposition candidate on November 21, 2014 only after meeting former President Chandrika Kumaratunga with the then opposition leader Ranil Wickremesinghe. ?There was no agreement before that,? he said.
Further, President Sirisena said the fact that the UNP supported him to become the President is deeply rooted in his heart. (Yohan Perera)

ITAK says intl. probe unnecessary
	
Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachci (ITAK) leader Mavai Senathirajah scoffed at Northern Province Chief Minister C.V.Wigneswaran?s demand for an International investigation into the alleged war crimes in Sri Lanka saying that an investigation had already been carried out by the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC).
Addressing a gathering to welcome the party?s new Members of Parliament from Wanni District at the party?s Vavuniya office, he said that an international investigation into the alleged war crimes had been carried out by the international community following a request made by ITAK to former UNHRC chief Navanethem Pillay, and that the report of the investigation was to be presented to the council this month.
Senadhirajah said that it was due to the ignorance of the Chief Minister regarding the political situation that the latter had called for an international investigation at a time when the party was planning to take further action after going through the report.
Criticising Mr. Wigneswaran for his refusal to participate in the general election campaign of the party, the ITAK leader said that his absence at election meetings had created many problems to the party, and the party leaders had been disappointed over it.
He warned that ITAK and its leadership would be compelled to take action against Mr. Wigneswaran over these issues.
He also criticised All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC) leader Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam for attempting to get the public to sign a petition demanding an international investigation, saying that it was unnecessary. (Romesh Madushanka)

UPFA group in Opposition to meet Speaker
	
Former Western Province Chief Minister Prasanna Ranatunga, who was elected to Parliament on the United People?s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) ticket, said he, along with others, would talk to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya about the opposition leadership post.
A section of the UPFA is opposed to the appointment of Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Leader R.Sampanthan to it. This group pushes for the appointment of Kalutara district MP Kumara Welgama to it.
Addressing a meeting in Gampaha, he said, he and the team would act as an opposition group though the UPFA had joined the National Unity Government with the UNP.
?The space to act according to conscience is getting contracted. We are not opposed to Mr. Sampanthan. Yet, the TNA ?controlled Northern Provincial Council passed a resolution calling for an international war crime probe on Sri Lanka,? he said.
Noting that his party did not seek a mandate for a national government, he said though former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was faulted for creating a mega Cabinet, the very same had been done at the moment.
?I will continue to fight till a Prime Minister representing Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP)-led UPFA is appointed one day. Mr. Rajapaksa never acted in a manner inimical to the interests of SLFP. He is a leader with patience,? Mr. Ranatunga said. (Kelum Bandara)

	As a mark of protest against the U.S. supporting Sri Lanka in war crime probe, a group of members from Ilaiya Thalaimurai Koottamaippu, an outfit comprising youngsters, threw rotten chicken waste into a KFC outlet in Ashok Nagar in central India on Saturday afternoon.
	The group also attempted to stage a protest outside the U.S. Consulate in Chennai. According to police, the group had earlier submitted a petition to the Consulate last month and gave 100 hours time for the U.S. government to change its stand on the investigation into the ?genocide.?
	?The time given by them expired by Saturday noon. Due to this, a few members of the outfit entered the KFC outlet in Ashok Nagar at 12.45 p.m. and littered it with rotten chicken. They also raised slogans against the U.S.,? a police source said.
	After this, the same group went to the U.S. Consulate. A member attempted to douse himself with petrol on Cathedral Road and tried to barge into the Consulate. The police nabbed him and another member who also attempted to get inside.

SL woman held in Saudi mansion by force
	
Chilling details of a Sri Lankan female migrant worker who has been detained by her employer in Saudi Arabia has come to light, as the victim?s daughter seeks government intervention to ensure her mother?s release.
The victim, S. Wasanthi ? a 46 year-old mother of three, had migrated to Saudi Arabia as a domestic worker for the third time on February 27. In March, her daughter R. Jayarani had received a call from Wasanthi, who had complained about the employer?s abuse.
?During the brief phone conversation, she told me she was being assaulted both verbally and physically. Thereafter on May 1, while I was in hospital to deliver my baby, my mother phoned me again and told me she suffered injuries and was hospitalised after she attempted to flee from the employer?s residence,? she said.
According to Jayarani, following two days of treatment at a hospital, the Saudi law enforcement authorities had reassigned her to return to her abusive employer despite her pleas to be taken to the Sri Lankan mission in KSA.
Jayarani had not received a call from her mother until two weeks ago.
?She spoke to me for less than two minutes. She sounded agitated and cried . . . she told me she was severely beaten and one arm was paralyzed as a result. Her hair had been cut off and said she was being kept locked up in a room in the employer?s mansion with no food or water for days,? the aggrieved daughter told Daily Mirror.
Since then, Jayarani says she has visited the employment agency through which her mother migrated, the Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission and the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau in seeking assistance to locate her mother and seek her release. So far none of the agencies have responded to Jayarani concerning the progress on complaints she lodged regarding her mother?s plight.
?I lodged a complained with the HRC on August 19. They informed that they would respond within two weeks but I still haven?t received a reply,? Jayarani said while adding, ?Since our father abandoned our family, it was my mother who worked hard to put food on the table. She migrated to ensure our futures were stable. I wish for my mother?s return and I plead from the government to intervene in this matter and ensure my mother?s safe return. . .? (Lakna Paranamanna)

A group of hardline Tamil National Alliance (TNA) members representing the Northern Provincial Council (NCP) will head for Geneva to lobby the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) for an international mechanism to try to the alleged rights violations and accountability issues, a party member said yesterday.
NCP member M.K. Sivajilingam told Daily Mirror he, along with members Ananthi Sasitharan, and the widow of LTTE activist Elilan were among the members planning to go to Genera.
Mr. Sivajilingam said these members were opposed to any domestic mechanism even under international observation, to probe the allegations and action against wrongdoers.
?We seek redress through an international judicial process,? he said.
However, the government has already announced that it will not agree to any international mechanism. The Office of High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) will submit its report on investigation of Sri Lanka?s case.
The session will start on September 15. (KB)

Viber, not India, helped in unseating MR- CBK
	
Former Sri Lankan president Chandrika Bandarnaike Kumaratunga is in India for her first visit since the surprise defeat of her successor Mahinda Rajapaksa, a man who was once a close associate and now a political enemy whose regime she was instrumental in overturning. She spoke for the first time to a group of Indian journalists including The Hindu?s Suhasini Haidar about how the opposition and Mr. Rajapaksa?s own party members were united. Excerpts from interaction with former President Kumaratunga on September 5th,2015:Qn: You are in India to attend the Hindu-Buddhist conclave in Bodh Gaya on behalf of Sri Lanka?what is the importance of this conclave that PM Modi also attended?
Chandrika Kumaratunga: I think its very important for Sri Lanka because the protagonists are from these two communities. So if we can find common ground between the two religions as opposed to diversities it would be useful. Of course the Tamil question never involved the religious aspect.Qn: This is also your first official visit to India since President Sirisena?s government was sworn in, and you have been appointed the envoy for reconciliation. How do you see India-Sri Lanka ties at present?
Chandrika Kumaratunga: Historically all Sri Lankan governments have had excellent relations with India. Except one government before Rajapaksa had various problems, which exacerbated the war in Sri Lanka. And the Rajapaksa regime did not have easy relations with India. But for our (Sirisena) government it wasn?t difficult to pick up from where my Presidency left off (in 2005). We saw the bad consequences of Rajapaksa?s policies towards India.Qn: Did India have any role in Mr. Rajapaksa?s electoral defeat? In an interview to The Hindu he had blamed Indian intelligency agency R&AW and Western countries of a conspiracy against him.
Chandrika Kumaratunga:That?s not true. No outside force had anything to do with. Except that right through Rajapaksa?s regime, international community lamented his policies, and asked me why I wasn?t returning to politics. But apart from that they had nothing to do with it. We can manage our own affairs?.Because he expected to win the election, he was in shock when he lost, and tried to look for scapegoats.Qn: You had a pivotal role in bringing together the opposition in defeating him. How did that happen?
Chandrika Kumaratunga: It just happened. Because everyone in the country starting from about two years into President Rajapaksa?s regime began to turn away from him. Even people from the opposition who normally would not have accepted my leadership, civil society in a big way came and asked me to return to politics. I said no, because I was very clear I wouldn?t return to electoral politics, not to hold positions. After the end of the war when President Rajapaksa won the elections in 2010 I thought he would improve. But that wasn?t the case, he was getting worse. You cant force the hand of history. So we couldn?t force a coup, it is the people who must want a change. So when people started protesting, civil society, fishermen, university professors, it was evident people wanted the change. People called me and said, I had brought the President in, I had to do something about him . I did feel I had done enough, my family had done enough, but I was ready to help. The real problem was that the opposition didn?t have someone who could win the election against Rajapaksa. So I had to start looking around, under great difficulties. Mr. Rajapaksa had forbidden every single person of our party the SLFP from talking to me. MPs used to run when they saw me. Otherwise they would get a call from the President. Amidst such circumstances, I identified Maithripala Sirisena. There weren?t many more to identify as it was to difficult to find anyone in the SLFP who wasn?t known to be corrupt or a murderer (laughs). It was very difficult to find someone from my party at a leadership level like that. I had worked with Maithripala and I knew he fitted the bill, atleast somewhat. Nobody?s perfect. Now I had to send messages through people to him. Sometimes I used messengers. The same messenger couldn?t go often, because it would be reported. It was a police state.Qn: Is there any truth to the story India provided communication devices, DRDO made satellite phones?
Chandrika Kumaratunga: No..completely false. We were using Viber. And the government didn?t know how to tap Viber. Apparently it is difficult for any intelligence agency anywhere to tap into Viber, although some can identify out who is calling whom. But Sri Lanka didn?t have that technology, otherwise we would have all been dead. I couldn?t afford a big office, I could only hire 2 people as Rajapaksa had closed down my office. But we managed somehow, and I can say that the main reason we were successful is that civil society really rose up. They were allies along with the UNP. Ranil Wickremshinghe wasn?t afraid to meet. I realised that we would need an alliance, because the opposition in our country had been weakened. So I had a hand in bringing them all together, and that was it. Eventually the common enemy brought us together.Qn: Given that, how much were you worried about Mr. Rajapaksa?s return to power in the recent elections that were won by the UNP? Especially given the strain within the party over the SLFP party ticket given by President Sirisena to Mr. Rajapaksa?
Chandrika Kumaratunga: Yes there was a strain between all of us, not only between the President and the PM. But that has since been resolved. And President Sirisena has redeemed himself during the campaign by his actions and statements during the campaign. I know that he was determined not to let the ?baddies? come back. But the President was trying to keep the party together, and was misled by the two secretaries of the party who deceived him because they were for Rajapaksa. Finally he did sack them, but we felt he should have sacked them much earlier. (The Hindu)
