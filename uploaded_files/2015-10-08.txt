Financial criteria considered for the ranking include share turnover, revenue, profit after tax, return on equity, Earnings per Share, market capitalisation and value addition.

	Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Pieris today noticed the FCID to show cause as to why it had violated the court procedure and produced former President?s Secretary Lalith Weeratunge and Former TRC Director General Anusha Pelpita in High Court without producing them before a Magistrate.
	The Magistrate issued notice on the OIC of the FCID, the DIG and Western Province ASP to show cause on November 5 for violating provisions of the Public Property Act and the Constitution.
	The Magistrate also refused to lift the restraining order made against Anusha Palpita from travelling abroad and observed that the FCID had arbitrarily violated the provisions of the Constitution and the Public Property Act.
	The Magistrate said the Public Property Act and the Constitution had affirmed that the suspects in Public property Act violation cases should be produced before a Magistrate and if the amount involved exceeds Rs 25,000 the suspects be remanded unless under special circumstances.
	Mr. Pieris said the FCID diverting from the practice, had produced the suspects Weeratunge and Pelpita in the High Court which released them on bail.
	He queried as to why the suspects were not produced before a Magistrate.
	He said the FCID had produced the suspects in High Court and released them on bail. Now the FCID is requesting the Magistrate to lift the travel ban on Pelpita.
	The Magistrate said Pelpita was not even present in court and the FCID had not submitted any documents in court which he said was incorrect.
	The Magistrate said the action of the police discredited the Magistrate Court.
	The Magistrate also emphasized that the Attorney General should assist the police to act according to the law.
	On the pronouncement of the Magistrate?s decision the legal representatives of the Hulftsdorp Magistrate Court, applauded the decision and Counsel Gunaratne Wanninayake representing the lawyers said the decision was a landmark one and had proved that the judiciary was the guardian of the law implementing the rule of law.

Germany?s Bundesbank?lists all gold bars to silence skeptics
	
		 		 
		 
			
RUETERS: Germany?s Bundesbank has published an exhaustive list of all the gold bars in its near 3,400-tonne reserve of the metal to bolster the bank?s standing as a guardian of stability among an increasingly wary public.
The central bank released the 2,300-page list, which also underscores its intention to repatriate some of the bars and store them in Frankfurt, following requests for more information amid speculation that some of the gold might no longer be there.
Just over one third of the reserve, which Germany started building in the post-war boom years, is now held underground at the Bundesbank in Frankfurt, while the rest is stored at the Federal Reserve in the United States, in France and in England.
?Half of Germany?s gold reserves will be stored in Germany by 2020 at the latest,? Carl-Ludwig Thiele, a member of the Bundesbank?s board said.
Publication of the list, which will be updated annually to show which gold bars are where, follows criticism that the Bundesbank was not being transparent about the 107-billion-euro ($120 billion) reserve.
That in turn partly reflects skepticism among ordinary Germans about the euro after an economic crisis almost fractured the currency that is used by 19 European countries.
?There were a lot of conspiracy theories about the gold not being there,? said Guntram Wolff, a German who heads Brussels think tank Bruegel, pointing to ?disenchantment? among ordinary Germans who have seen the value of their savings dwindle. ?Trust in the Bundesbank has suffered,? said Peter Boehringer, author of a book entitled ?Bring our gold home?. ?The Bundesbank must prove that the gold is there.?
The impact of the global financial crisis has been mild in Germany compared with other European countries. Nonetheless, some Germans are worried.
?The gold reserves show stability. The German people are happy to know that the Bundesbankis watching over this wealth, which belongs to them,? said a former Bundesbank official.
?It could be helpful, for instance, in covering some of the costs were Germany to leave the single currency.?

Kondaya?s statement not proof of crime: Police
	
Police Spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara said today a suspect could not be named as an accused just because he or she had made a statement to the police in connection with a crime.
He said a suspect?s statement held no legal value until police investigations found evidence to prove that the statement was true.
ASP Gunasekara expressed these views at a news conference when asked about the fate of suspect Dunesh Priyashantha alias ?Kondaya? who was arrested and remanded in connection with the sexual abuse and killing of five-year-old Seya Sadewmi.
?A statement doesn?t make a suspect an accused or he cannot be named as the main suspect in a crime. As police spokesman, I never said Dunesh Priyashantha confessed to the crime. All he did was make a statement,? ASP Gunasekara said.
He said the police had to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt based on the evidence that had been collected and however, admitting in Court to having committed a crime can be considered as part of the evidence. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Profits at big U.S. banks soar since crisis - N.Y. Fed
	
		 		 
		 
			
REUTERS: Profits have soared since the global financial crisis at the five biggest U.S. banks with market-making dealing operations, New York Federal Reserve economists said in an article released yesterday.
From 2009 to 2014, the combined net income of J.P. Morgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley annually averaged US $ 41.73 billion, up from annual average of US $ 25.08 billion from 2002 to 2008, they said.
Helping boost profits were trading revenues that they and other dealers have seen returning to the levels before the financial crisis seven years ago.
Their annual income was also more stable than pre-crisis levels, they added.
There have been concerns tighter regulations have caused significant cutback in dealers? market-making activities, resulting in a decline in market liquidity and ?flash? events including the one seen nearly a year ago in the Treasuries market.
?These trading revenue and income figures suggest that dealers continue to play a key role in liquidity provision,? New York Fed economists Tobias Adrian, Michael Fleming, Or Shachar, Daniel Stackman and Erik Vogt wrote in their blog titled ?Changes in the Returns to Market Making?.
The banks? ?Sharpe ratio? on their income rose to 2.28 from 1.23, suggesting milder swings in their annual earnings since the global credit crunch.?

She had cited Elections Commissioner, Returning Offer of the Colombo District, Attorney General and 22 others as Respondents.She had bemoaned the fact that in respect of certain polling divisions, the votes secured by some candidates had been arbitrarily, illegally and unlawfully altered by the election officials present at the computer room when entering the same into the computer system.
	She complained that no passes were issued by the Elections Commissioner?s office enabling counting agents of the party to be present in the computer room at the time the written statements were being processed/entered into the computer system.

Russian Cruise Missiles hit ISIS in Syria from 900 miles away
	
Russian warships joined the conflict in Syria with a volley of cruise missile attacks on Islamic State as Syrian government troops launched a major ground offensive supported by Moscow air strikes.
Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu told Vladimir Putin in televised remarks that four ships based 900 miles away in the Caspian Sea had launched 26 'Sizzler' missiles - and claimed they would strike 11 ISIS targets.
Video released by the Russian Defence Ministry shows the warships launching the missiles which Shoigu insisted destroyed all the targets and did not hit any civilian areas.
?? ?
Moscow's defence ministry said the attacks were launched from warships Dagestan, Uglich, Grad Sviyazhsk and Veliky Ustyug.
The cruise missiles, each costing hundreds of thousands of pounds, 'engaged all the assigned targets successfully and with high accuracy' said one Russian media report, giving no further details.
The missiles fly at 550mph and have a range of more than 1,500 miles.
The attacks came as Syrian government troops launched a ground offensive Wednesday in the country's central region under cover of Russian airstrikes, a Damascus official said.
The latest developments ? exactly a week after Russia began launching airstrikes in Syria ? add a new layer to the fray in the complex war that has torn this Mideast country apart since 2011.
Moscow has mainly targeted central and northwestern Syria, strategic regions that are the gateway to President Bashar Assad's strongholds in Damascus, and along the Mediterranean coast.
But the strikes appear to have given Assad new confidence to try to retake some lost ground. (Daily Mail)
