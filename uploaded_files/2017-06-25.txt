Gamage cries foul at Geetha
	
Piyasena Gamage, the UPFA?s next in line Candidate in the Galle District at the 2015 Parliamentary Election intervened in the Appeal filed in the Supreme Court by Galle District UPFA Parliamentarian Geetha Kumarasinghe, who had challenged the Court of Appeal judgment.
The Bench comprising Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, Justices Eva Wanasundera and Upaly Abeyrathne fixed for July 7 to be taken up this matter along with Geetha Kumasinghe?s appeal.
He filed intervention papers crying foul at her for the failure to name him as a Respondent, whereas he should have been named to the appeal application.
He alleged that she had been guilty of fraudulently suppressing material facts from the Court. He is among others seeking the Court to dismiss her appeal in limine and to vacate the Interim Order granted by the Supreme Court staying the judgment of the Court of Appeal.
A motion in limine is a motion filed by a party to a lawsuit which asks the court for an order or ruling limiting or preventing certain evidence from being presented by the other side at the trial of the case.
Intervenient-Petitioner Piyasena Gamage states at the August 2015 General Election, he received the 7th highest number of preferential votes among the UPFA candidates in the Galle District.
He states Geetha Kumarasinghe received 5th highest number of preferential votes thus secured a seat and the Court of Appeal on 3rd May 2017 issued a Writ of Quo Warranto against her and that she was thus disqualified from continuing to hold office.
On 4th May 2017, he was informed by the Secretary of the UPFA that he would be appointed as the MP to fill the said seat fallen vacant.
He cited Supreme Court Rules wherein there shall be named a respondent, the party or parties in whose favor the judgment or order complained against was delivered or adversely to whom such application is preferred, and the names and present addresses of all such respondents shall be set out in full.
He contends that he is a party whose interest may be adversely affected by the success of the appeal, and he should thus have been named as a Respondent in accordance with the terms of Supreme Court Rules.
He impugns the failure to do so is a clear violation of the Supreme Court Rules, due procedure and natural justice and warrants the vacating and/or setting aside the Interim Order issued and the dismissal of the appeal.
The Supreme Court on15th May 2017 granted Special Leave to Appeal with the application filed by Ms Kumarasinghe seeking to set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal which disqualified her as a Member of Parliament on her impugned dual citizenship.
In the majority decision of the Bench comprising Justices Eva Wanasundera, Upaly Abeyrathne and Anil Gooneratne, the Court extended the Interim Order staying till final determination the operation of the Court of Appeal judgment. Hearing is fixed for September 25. S.S. (Selvanayagam)

Sri Lanka legends question Ford exit
	
As Sri Lanka begin their search for a ninth head coach in six years, Test champions Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardena have questioned the circumstances that led to Graham Ford's departure from the role.
Sri Lanka Cricket announced Saturday that Ford's 15-month stint at the helm of the national team would be cut short by mutual consent, having originally been appointed to guide the team through the 2019 World Cup in England.
Despite an upset win over India, Sri Lanka failed to qualify for the semi-finals of the Champions Trophy after defeats to South Africa and eventual title-winners Pakistan.
Sangakkara, who has previously spoke in glowing terms of Ford's coaching skills, suggested "there may not be (any) coaches left to employ" for Sri Lanka at the current rate.
The 39-year-old also expressed reservations over the role of recently-appointed 'cricket manager' Asanka Gurusinha, a 41-Test former Sri Lanka batsman.
@aruna_jaya67 @daniel86cricket at the rate Slc is getting through them there may not be coaches left to employ.
? Kumar Sangakkara (@KumarSanga2) June 23, 2017
In response to a BBC reporter's claim that Ford had resigned after being denied a request to make changes regarding Gurusinha's role and national selection, Jayawardena described the South African as a "fantastic coach" and a loss for Sri Lanka.
If it's true, honest request from a fantastic coach. Shame SL lost Fordy... he was very good. https://t.co/HFlZVyEXWl
? Mahela Jayawardena (@MahelaJay) June 24, 2017
Ford had previously coached Sri Lanka for two years in 2012-2014, taking them to the final of the World T20 tournament they hosted in his first year in charge.
He replaced former Australia batsman Geoff Marsh in the role. Including interim appointments, Sri Lanka have had eight different coaches since 2011.
Sangakkara recently hailed Ford as "one of the best coaches in the world".
"Anyone who has worked with him since the days South Africa were top of their game or to the Surrey boys, or to Kent, he has been the reason why so many young teams in transition ? the word we use ? have done so well over the years," Sangakkara told Cricbuzz.
"Sri Lanka have the talent and they have the right man in charge. It's time to allow them to freely go around doing what they can do.
"That is 'Fordy' to coach cricket and players to play cricket. If you let them be in charge of doing their jobs, without too much interference, it's going to work."
Ford's departure comes just days before Sri Lanka's next international engagement, a one-day series with Zimbabwe starting in Galle on Friday.
"It's been a privilege to work with these talented young men over the past 15 months. Their passion for the sport is inspiring, as is indeed this nation's," Ford said in a statement released by Sri Lanka Cricket.
"Sri Lanka has grown on me, and although we've made the decision to part ways where coaching is concerned, she will always have a little piece of my heart.
"I look forward to sitting up on that beautiful Fort down in Galle and taking in a bird's eye view of Sri Lanka's special brand of cricket ? this time without having to chew my nails to the bone.
"I wish Sri Lanka Cricket and the boys the very best, and I must offer a word of advice to the young men ? Always believe in yourself, believe in your team, and play from your heart."
Sri Lanka famously swept the then world No.1 ranked Australian Test team 3-0 in mid-2016. They also won a Twenty20 series in Australia earlier this year, albeit against an Australia side missing several leading players.
Sri Lanka Cricket president Thilanga Sumathipala thanked Ford for his "invaluable contribution" to the country.
?"He joined us at a time where we were quoted by the ICC as being on the 'verge of suspension' and at a time where things were volatile and uncertain, Ford had faith in us & has given us his fullest support," Sumathipala said.
"This was a decision arrived at mutually after careful consideration and deliberation and we are both confident of its propriety.
"Ford epitomises the character of cricket as a true gentleman, and we are indeed sorry to see him go."(Cricket Network)
