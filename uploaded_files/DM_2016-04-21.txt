Centre to share intelligence on drug trafficking: Minister
	
The government will set up a centre for sharing intelligence on Drug Trafficking, Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake said yesterday.
The Government has taken initial steps to establish A Centre for Sharing Intelligence on Drug Trafficking to empower national institutions for accurate information dissemination in South Asian and South East Asian regions, the Minister had told the UN Special Session on World Drug problem held in New York .
Further, he had told the sessions that Sri Lanka stood committed to extend its fullest cooperation to all international efforts to combat the world drug problem, a problem which has no boarders, which threatens to destabilize all our societies.
Further, the government is fully conscious of its international obligations, particularly those stemming from the Single Convention on Narcotics Drugs 1961, Convention on Psychotropic Substances 1971, and United Nations Convention Against Illicit Trafficking in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances 1988 ratified by the government. Sri Lanka also steered the negotiations on the SAARC Regional Convention on narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Drugs and Substances and is a party to the SAARC Convention, the Minister said.
The Government reaffirms its political will and determination to tackle the drug problem locally and assist in this cause internationally by reviewing the existing National Policy, which was formulated more than a decade ago, he added.
Mr. Ratnayake said the government is conscious of the illicit production, trafficking and abuse of drugs in the country; adverse effects of drug use on health of drug dependents; the upsurge in drug related crime; the draining of human, natural and financial resources and the destruction of individuals, families and communities due to drug use.
All institutions that come under government purview will be required to adhere to this national policy. The concerned non-governmental agencies are expected to be active partners in the implementation of the government policy. Fulfillment of the social responsibilities of private sector institutions within the framework of this policy is also critical in drug prevention and control, he added.
He said the overall goal of the government in relation to the drug problem was an ambitious one, to reduce the drug supply and drug use to minimum levels by 2020.This goal will be pursued relentlessly by all drug law enforcement agencies, the government agencies directly involved in drug demand reduction, including provincial and local administrations and other agencies, which have a potential for contributing to the end objective and NGOs and private sector agencies.

EU lifts fish ban on Sri Lanka
	
The European Commission (EC) today announced that the fish ban imposed on Sri Lanka in 2015 by the European Union (EU) was lifted after a lengthy dialogue process.
Sri Lanka has now successfully reformed its fisheries governance system. The country was issued with a yellow card in 2012 and been listed by the Council in February 2015. By today it has amended its legal framework, strengthened sanctions and improved its fleet control, a press release published on the Commissions website said.
It said Sri Lanka joins the growing list of countries (Ghana, Papua New Guinea, Korea, the Philippines, Fiji, Belize, Panama, Togo and Vanuatu) that have reformed their systems, following a warning by the EU on illegal fishing.
EU had also warned Kiribati, Sierra Leone and Trinidad & Tobago with yellow cards as they risk being uncooperative in the fight against illegal fishing.

Liberal atmosphere a must for stopping ragging at universities: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today stressed the need to have a liberal atmosphere within universities as a basis for stopping the incidence of ragging.
Mr. Wickremesinghe made these remarks addressing a workshop organized by the University Grants Commission (UGC) and the Centre for Gender Studies.
He said it was difficult to stop ragging as long as there was no liberal atmosphere.
Most of you at the last presidential elections either addressed meeting or signed advertisements supportive of two main candidates -President Maithripala Sirisena or Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The majority of students voted for one of the two of them. The irony is that you cant have these candidates or their supporters functioning in universities.
We have to resolve this issue. We are a multi-party state. We are planning to carry on as a multi-party state. Within the Universities such plurality must apply. In this present atmosphere could Professor Sarathchandra direct Maname in universities He could have been prohibited from entering universities and the Maname cast would have been ragged, he said.
The Prime Minister queried as to why the associations of any party, be it the United National Party, Sri Lanka Freedom Party, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, Tamil National Alliance or Mahajana Eksath Peramuna could not function within the universities.
"There were times when Dr. N. M. Perera and Dudley Senanayake came and addressed the universities. It was quite open. he added.
Stopping ragging goes hand in hand with a liberal atmosphere. When you have student elections like in our days, different parties compete with each other and people are not ragged," he further said.
Mr. Wickremesinghe also asserted on the need to change the university structure.
When the Minister of Law and Order consulted me with regard to the setting up of a university for Police and Criminal Justice, I recommend him not to look at the Sri Lankan University Structure but to look at the Australian structure which is a combination of UK and American one which has a deputy Vice Chancellor for Academic Development and Staff programme. While we look at this structure I would recommend having an Assistant Vice Chancellors for student services and student matters. We have student councillors but that is not adequate to resolve todays issues, the Prime Minister said.
While we look at the setting up of a university for the Police and Criminal Justice, we should also look at how we change the laws with regard to role of the universities and the structure of the universities. Unfortunately we have the same structure which we had under the University of Ceylon Act in 1942, he added. (Yohan Perera)

MR's words of wisdom for new IGP
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said today the new Inspector General of Police (IGP) should be alert on police officers who act according to the whims of the government and harass those with dissenting political views, expecting favours in return.
He made these remarks at a function held in Thorakolayaya, Embilipitiya on the occasion of the birthday of Ven. Pusselpitiye Suneetharathna Thera.
Though the celebrations were scheduled to be held in the afternoon, former President Mahinda Rajapakse arrived at the site early in the morning, and the day been a Poya day a large number of devotees who were observing Sil and villagers from the vicinity congregated when the former president made his appearance.
He began addressing the crowd present after wishing the chief prelate long life, said that he had witnessed the new development in the temple and attributed it to the efforts of the Thera. He recalled the past , by calling to memory the brutal killings of the youth that took place during the JVP insurgency, and how bodies were burnt on tires lit. He hinted that his own houses in Medamulana and Hanwella were subjected to attacks by these groups, and he was provided security by former President J.R. Jayawardene and the then Defence Minister Ranjan Wijerathne.
He also revealed that his government launched a mass development programme with the aim of achieving self sufficiency in food. It had now become a serious issue with the idea of using paddy lands for other purposes and the water stored in tanks not been released for agricultural purposes.
He also compared the festive periods celebrated under his rule where there was plenty and the farmers having received a high price for their harvest were in the forefront of the celebrations, but claimed this year it was different as the paddy prices hit rock bottom and fertilizer was beyond the reach of these farmers.
He countered allegations by the opponents that he was criticizing the government, but said that these were mentioned to help guide this government.
He slated the actions of the CID and the FCID saying they were bent on creating cases with a view of the police officers getting promotions and stars. Some are forced to accuse others of wrong doings.
There had been acts of duress where the police hierarchy had been involved. It had now turned out to be the complainant blindly signing a statement purported to have been prepared previously, he said. (Ajithlal Shantha Udaya, Jayantha Nanayakkara and Yasith Nalin Jayaweera)

NPC intends to form a Tamil State - JHU
	
The true intention of the Northern Provincial Council (NPC) was to pave the way for a Tamil State under the guise of a Federal State, the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) charged yesterday.
National Organiser and JHU Western Province Councilor Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said measures taken by the NPC would lead to a conflict between the people representing different ethnic groups.
He stated that the conduct of Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran affected the reconciliation process initiated by the government and the people in the South.
In the past, based on language issues, former president Chandrika Kumaratunga also attempted to introduce a federal state system to the country, but it was defeated by them. The initiatives taken by the NPC based on the language issue violates the Constitution, and this could act as a barrier for the countrys peace and reconciliation process, he said.
Mr. Warnasinghe pointed out that Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Leader and Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan had raised serious concerns about dividing the country based on language issues and introducing a Tamil State.
All they want is more power and they have done nothing for Tamil people in the North by the funds provided to them, he said. (Yoshitha Perera)

SL moves up in 2016 World Press Freedom Index
	
Sri Lanka has moved up 24 notches and ranked at 141st place in the 2016 World Press Freedom Index compiled by the Reporters Without Borders - Reporters sans frontieres (RSF) which was published on Wednesday.
The country was ranked at 165th place in the index in 2015. The index report published on RSF website said Sri Lanka had freed itself of the reign of terror imposed by the Rajapaksa family and its allies by electing Maithripala Sirisena as President.
The new government has said journalists and cyber-dissidents would no longer have to fear reprisals for their political views or for articles on sensitive subjects as corruption and the military. The Tamil media, long a target of the authorities, including after the official end of the civil war in 2009, have seen a decline in harassment and hope it will last, it said.
However, the index showed that there has been a deep and disturbing decline in respect of media freedom at both the global and regional levels.
Finland ranked 1st in the index as the country with the most freedom for journalists followed by the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, New Zealand, Costa Rica, Switzerland, Sweden, Ireland and Jamaica.
Eretria made it to the bottom of the list followed by North Korea, Turkmenistan, Syria and China.
Sri Lankas neighbouring countries India ranked at 133, Pakistan at 147, Afghanistan at 120, Bangladesh at 144, Nepal at 105 and Bhutan at 94.
The Index measures the level of freedom available to journalists in 180 countries using the criteria of pluralism, media independence, media environment and self-censorship, legislative environment, transparency, infrastructure and abuses.

Some HR concerns still remain in Sri Lanka: UK
	
The United Kingdom (UK) on Thursday said that though there was an improvement in overall human rights situation in Sri Lanka in 2015, some human rights concerns still remain in the country.
The Annual Human Rights Report-2015 issued by the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office said the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) had taken positive steps to improve freedom of expression including the media and freedom of movement, reduce inter-community tensions and restore the independence of institutions such as the Human Rights Commission. 
The government also signalled its willingness to address long-standing allegations of past human rights abuses and violations co-sponsoring the UNHRC resolution committing it to reconciliation, accountability and the protection of human rights. In a positive change of approach, the government engaged constructively with the international community, including with the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and other UN bodies, the report said.
It said the UK was a strong advocate for the OHCHR Investigation on Sri Lanka (OISL) and instrumental in the adoption of the HRC resolution in which the OISL recommendations were reflected. 
In 2016, we expect the positive trajectory to continue. This is a moment of opportunity for Sri Lanka, and the international community has an important role to play, it said.
The report said the UK will continue to encourage and support Sri Lanka to deliver on its commitments to the UNHRC and to make early progress to build wider support for its efforts to address accountability as the OHCHR present its recommendations at the next UNHRC session in June.
Meanwhile, it also said UK Prime Minister David Cameron has pledged euro 6.6 million over the next three years to continue their support for reconciliation and human rights. Our work with the GOSL will aim to continue strengthening democracy and the rule of law, and reform the security sector, sharing UK experience and expertise, the report said.
