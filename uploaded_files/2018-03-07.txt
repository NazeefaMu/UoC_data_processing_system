Forgotten flicks: Kadapathaka Chaya
	
In Kadapathaka Chaya, Vasantha Obeyesekere reaches out as? far as he can without losing ground. When he went beyond in the film? that followed it, Maruthaya, he not only lost ground, he lost us. In? terms of the techniques and themes he used and resorted to ? and there? weren?t many of them ? he both triumphs and fails in here. Like his? previous films, with the exception of Diyamanthi, Kadapathaka Chaya is? based on a real story, which involves the murder of a businessman by a? relative, at the hospital he had been admitted to, who alleged that he? had abused her. By the time we get to the sequence of the murder, we? know what will happen. Obeyesekere?s most discernible motif was his? desire to hint at a sense of foreboding. We know something terrible will? happen, but we don?t know what exactly; the litmus test for a Vasantha? Obeyesekere movie is thus not the climax, but the preparation to that? climax.? ?
We know something terrible will? happen, but we don?t know what exactly; the litmus test for a Vasantha? Obeyesekere movie is thus not the climax
In his early films ? which I have seen, with the exception? of Ves Gaththo ? Obeyesekere didn?t toy around with the juxtaposition of? the past and the present and the future the way he did after? Palagetiyo. Palagetiyo, in that sense, was a closing chapter to a phase? in his career that was marked out by an overwhelmingly naturalistic? tone. In other words, there was no attempt at sensationalising or trying? in any way to evoke a sense of melodrama out of the stories he adapted.? He changed, in that respect, in Dadayama, for two reasons: because the? background material (the murder of Adlene Vitharana) could not be? adapted to the screen without doing away with that naturalism, and? because he had reached a point where he needed to open out. Technically? and formally, Dadayama hence enthralls us with its almost blinding use? of sharp colours, in sharply defined contours: the talon-like nails that? Swarna Mallawarachchi uses to scratch Ravindra Randeniya in the final? sequence, for instance. A British filmmaker, having seen the film, is? reported to have said that it seemed to him to have come from a? conventional Hollywood thriller. He was correct, though not entirely so,? because when placed against the Sinhala cinema, there?s nothing exactly? conventional?
about Dadayama.? ?
A brief recapitulation of Kadapathaka Chaya?s plot might? help us here. Nanda, played by Swarna Mallawarachchi, is still attending? school when her brother-in-law Danaratne, played by Vijaya Kumaratunga? in his last great performance, rapes her. To hide the scandal, he and? his wife (Sunethra Sarachchandra) take her out of school and move her to? an aunt?s home, where she is discovered by her teenage paramour,? Piyatilake (Sanath Gunathilake). Both Danaratne and his wife decide that? it?s best to marry her off, and they get her married to Piyatilake, who? proves to be an incompetent though well-meaning and peaceable husband.? When he?s expelled from the Army for having taken excessive leave from? duty, he?s saved by Danaratne, who proposes that he run a business. The? business proves to be a mess and disaster; Piyatilake can?t help but? extend the line of credit to his customers. One thing leads to another,? he discovers his wife?s affair with Danaratne, and after a confrontation? with Danaratne, is injured. Nanda, swearing vengeance, visits him at a? hospital and murders him by throwing acid on his face.?
The best summing up of Kadapathaka Chaya I can make is, Vasantha Obeyesekere treads on territory he has not?tread before?
Right until the scene of that murder, Kadapathaka Chaya? moves rather inexorably, aware of its own terrible, gruesome trajectory.? Unlike Dadayama, where you weren?t aware of who the victim was and what? the villain had done to her, until sometime, or for that matter whether? the villain was actually a ?bad guy? (Ravindra Randeniya?s facile? charm, as always, makes us doubt his motives throughout), the villains? and the victims in this film are sharply and clearly defined. The? characters are no longer concealing their intentions, because the? director provides various cues ? noticeably by the use of a voiceover? from the present to provide a point of contrast to a sequence placed in? the past ? to make us aware of what those intentions are. If you had? even a modicum of sympathy for Priyankara Jayanath from Dadayama, for? instance, you don?t feel even that for Danaratne, because he?s? overbearingly unlikeable. And that?s what makes the first half of? Kadapathaka Chaya click: the fact that we know who these people are. We? hence need someone to identify with. When that someone (Nanda) loses her? gentleness and springs up on her tormentor with vengeance, we feel? ominous about her too. Obeyesekere gives us armfuls of air to clutch at.? Predictably, naturally, we clutch and fall.? ?
It has been said by some of his critics that Vasantha? Obeyesekere tends to go overboard in certain sequences which require? slight explication. This defect, which is less a defect than a quality? to be met with in most auteurs, hardly crops up in Palagetiyo (in fact? it never really crops up at all); it?s never really apparent even in? Dadayama, though the few scenes which show us the conflict between? Priyankara?s obligation to the woman he raped and made pregnant and? later made love to and again made pregnant on the one hand, and his? societal aspirations in the form of his impending engagement to the? upper-class woman he meets right after his first encounter with the girl? he abandons, are lengthened, as though we didn?t get his point the? first time.? ?In Kadapathaka Chaya this comes out most strikingly in the? first 45 minutes, during which the past and the present cut to each? other by the juxtaposition of the police testimonies (which we don?t? see, except for Piyatilake?s testimony on Danaratne?s character),? Nanda?s marriage life, and, from the beginning and after that wedding,? her affair with Danaratne. When Nanda?s sister embraces her sorrowfully? on the night of Danaratne?s rape, we immediately hear her testimony ?? ?She [Nanda] was a big liar. My husband was a good man, a virtuous man!?? ? and we made aware of the contradiction in a literal-minded way. That? kind of literal-mindedness comes off more as a weakness than a defect,? the same sort of weakness which oozes out throughout Maruthaya.? ?
The cast helped to both contain and accentuate this? particular weakness. As Danaratne, for instance, Vijaya Kumaratunga? towers over the audience frighteningly. When he smiles, he conceals his? real character beneath, and we think for a moment that that is his real? character, but when that smile disappears, when he frowns and, worse,? loses his temper in a terrible way, we feel that he?s not channelling? his real character, rather that he?s channelling a different character.? Every ?good? act he commits, out of sinister motives or out of a sincere? effort to make amends with his sister-in-law ? like rescuing Piyatilake? from a dishonourable discharge from the military ? is rushed over so? quickly that when he turns loose and asserts himself ? as when he rages? at Piyatilake for being overly generous with his customers and their? lines of credit ? he?s rather bestial: not like Ravindra Randeniya from? Dadayama, but in a more sinister, suave, elegant way. His voice betrays? the sophistication of the depraved rich: false, tawdry, yet contained.? What happens in the end that his performance is as literally put out as? the editing and?the camerawork?? ?
The cast helped to both contain and accentuate this? particular weakness. As Danaratne, for instance, Vijaya Kumaratunga? towers over the audience frighteningly
And when the sense of horror and suspense of seeing the? past and the present meet wears off, and when Nanda, after years of? imprisonment, is released, and after she discovers that her husband has become a much worse and more inhumane social climber than her? brother-in-law, the story loosens up a little, then a lot, and then? completely. This is where that aforementioned defect of Obeyesekere? crops up most visibly: when he?s reworking and recycling the same theme? and motif, again and again. We see Piyatilake flourish in his business? (at the cost of his humanity), and the sequences which depict his shift? from the amiable fool to the calculating entrepreneur are covered with? so much apparentness that what they gain in density, they lose in? subtlety.? ?
He betrays his own benefactor (J. H. Jayawardena) in the? shop he works at by getting him caught in a kasippu racket; he fires the? receptionist who calls him while he is at an important meeting even? though it was his wife who insisted on her calling him; he dreams of? opening up hospitals and schools in his name, thus turning into a? megalomaniacal politician. These are scenes that require elaboration,? but in Obeyesekere?s hands they turn into cardboard cut-outs. In the? end, the only person who gains solidity is Nanda (owing in no small part? to Swarna Mallawarachchi?s able performance), and when she is? alienated, finding herself forlorn and uncared for, there?s no point in? carrying on with the story: the camera moves away from her life, and the? credits roll. (In my article on Swarna to this newspaper, I have? mentioned how Laleen Jayamanne, in Towards Cinema and Its Double, views? her performance: not the woman who?s fated to destroy her man, but the? woman who becomes an avenger through a complex array of familial,? social, and?power relationships.)? ?
Perhaps the best summing up of Kadapathaka Chaya I can make? here is that in it, Vasantha Obeyesekere treads on territory he has not? tread before. He extends his techniques, notably the contrasts of past? and present, without making them a cover for the entire story. But it?s? an act of extending them alright, particularly the use of those? contrasts, because in Dadayama, they don?t last for half the movie, they? last for about half an hour. He needed to flesh out, to go beyond, but? without fleshing out his story and making his character solid and? complex, he couldn?t go beyond. And in the end, with Maruthaya, that is? what happened. Kadapathaka Chaya thus belongs to a twilight phase,? before the man would move into the third, and final, career phase:? becoming more gruesome, and at times, more literal-minded.? ?

JVP lashes out at Govt. over racism
	
JVP leader and Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake said yesterday the government declared a state of emergency to suppress the peoples' struggle for their rights.
He said the general law was sufficient to take action against those who carry out violence.
"The government has failed to address the burning issues of the people, and protests are a blessing to the government to divert the attention of the people," he said.
Moving an adjournment debate on the current situation in the country, the MP said the government was attempting to capitalise on the communal tension in the country to divert the mounting pressure on the government, while the opposition was capitalising it to gain power.
He said steps should be taken to defeat racial politics and added that those responsible for communal tension should be brought to book.
"We will not be able to create national harmony among the different communities as long as racism was cultivated in the minds of the people. We as a country will not have a good future if racism prevailed in the country," he said and added that politics based on racism had been operating throughout.
Mr. Dissanayake said the government members, instead of focusing on the issues of the people,?were concerned about their personal matters after the defeat at the local government elections.
"The government is bothered about the premiership and ministries rather than issues of the common people. They are not concerned about addressing issues of the common man such as purchasing of paddy, the unemployment of graduates and health issues. People should have resorted to a struggle against the government to win their rights, instead of a communal clash. It is a blessing for the government that people had resorted to a communal clash than a struggle against the government. That is why the government had allowed this sort of situations to thrive," he said.
He said the government should identify situations which could lead to communal clashes in advance, rather than acting like reporters and postmortem examiners, after an incident. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

12 million girls a year become child brides: UNICEF

DPA, 06th MARCH, 2018- An estimated 12 million girls under 18 are getting married every year globally, according to new data from UNICEF released on Tuesday.
The newly collated figures signal a 15 per cent drop in the last decade, from one in four to approximately one in five girls.
But if child marriage continues at the current rate, more than 150 million girls across the world will marry before their 18th birthdays by 2030, the UN children?s fund reports.
?When a girl is forced to marry as a child, she faces immediate and lifelong consequences. Her odds of finishing school decrease while her odds of being abused by her husband and suffering complications during pregnancy increase,? Anju Malhotra, UNICEF?s principal gender adviser, said in a statement. In South Asia, there has been a decrease in the prevalence of child brides from 50 per cent ten years ago to 30 per cent today.

More powers for Police, Tri-Forces
	
Following the imposition of the State of Emergency, the Police and Tri-forces had been empowered to arrest anyone who creates violence or communal disharmony with the arrested being either sentenced to 20 years imprisonment or sentenced to life imprisonment, Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said.
Based on the intelligence reports, the Government in a extraordinary Gazette No 2061/18 declared the State of Emergency at 2.45 pm yesterday for a period of seven days under the provisions of Clause five in Section two of the Public Security Ordinance.
SP Gunasekara said President Maithripala Sirisena had imposed special regulations declaring severe punishments for criminal acts.
Accordingly, causing deaths and injuries, sexual harassment, damaging to properties, burglary and obtain properties by force, robbing, behaviours obstructing ethnic harmony, distributing information leading to disharmony, hate speeches, statements, reports, using social media for such action had been declared as criminal acts.
If anyone is found guilty of committing such acts, attempt to commit or conspiracies for such actions would be subjected to either 20 years of imprisonment or life imprisonment.
In addition to the police, all the members attached to tri-forces had been given authority to arrest individuals who commit identified offences during the period of the State of Emergency.
SP Gunasekara explained that the arrested suspects should be immediately handed over to the nearest Police Station and that they should be produce before a magistrate within 24 hours by the police.
However, concerning the nature of the offence, DIGs had been given the authority to issue detention orders to hold the suspects in Police Custody not exceeding 14-days if there was a need for further investigations.
?Once a suspect was produced in a Court, they can only be released under special circumstances or should be held in remand custody until the trial is over? he added.
Meanwhile, the State officials and statutory bodies were given authority to take necessary steps to prevent spread of false information or news that harbour fear or a threat to communal harmony on social media or any other medium.
He further said the Police, Tri-forces personnel, State officials and statutory bodies were bound by law to prevent violation of special regulations adopted under State of Emergency situation.
A close watch has been set up with the support of Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team (SLCERT) and the Crime Investigation Division (CID) computer room to prevent acts cause on communal disharmony via social media.
Further he said special orders were issued by the President soon after declaring the State of Emergency last evening to control the mobs in several areas using the given authority as soon as possible.
The President had ordered to the relevant authorities to implement the new regulations without violating the Fundamental Rights of the public.
SP Gunasekara said the President had strictly instructed to enforce the law on criminal suspects without taking into consideration of their status, race, religion or political loyalty.
He said the Government is observing the prevailing situation continuously and is willing to lift the State of Emergency soon after the tense situation was brought completely under control.
Police and the Security Forces heads who met, soon after the declaration, had designed and initiated a special security protocol especially for the areas where the tense situation prevailed by last evening.
SP Gunasekara advised the public to inform the nearest police station or the Police Headquarters if they receive any information of crime incident or attempts of such activity.
Police requested the public to adhere to the country?s law and ensure the law and order and to give the their fullest cooperation to the law authorities.
Meanwhile, the police curfew had been re-imposed in Kandy administrative district from 8 pm last evening until 6 am today.
All government schools in the Kandy administrative district would remained close today as well under the instructions of Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

North Korea has said it will not need to keep its nuclear weapons if military threats against the country are resolved and it receives a credible security guarantee, South Korea has said today.
The promise was made to a delegation of South Korean officials during a two-day visit to Pyongyang where they held talks with dictator Kim Jong-Un.
The head of the delegation also said Kim had vowed never to use nuclear and conventional weapons against South Korea, and agreed to a meeting with president Moon Jae-In in April.
North Korea also expressed willingness to hold a ?candid dialogue? with the United States on de-nuclearisation and diplomacy, and pledged that it would freeze its nuclear and missile testing programme while such talks with?
are underway.
The summit talks, which are to be held at the border truce village of Panmunjom in late April, will be the third inter-Korean summit talks ever held - and the first in over a decade.? Kim Jong Un seemingly put on a charm offensive when meeting the South Korean delegation yesterday, as images released by North Korean state news shows him grinning broadly as he grasps the hand of one of the visiting officials.He also appeared to be in a jovial mood later in the day, when he hosted a dinner with his wife, Ri Sol-Ju, where one of the officials had Kim?s sister Kim Yo-Jong as his?

Former President and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday rejected the reports of Digana violence stemming from a political conspiracy and said the incident reflects the inaction of the UNP.
?This is not a political conspiracy. It reflects the inaction of the UNP. They are not keen on resolving the matter and the government has deviated from its responsibilities. There is no one to turn to,? Mr. Rajapaksa responded to journalists outside his residence in Nugegoda yesterday.
Party leaders of the Joint Opposition met a group of Islamic community leaders at Mr. Rajapaksa?s residence last evening.
Speaking to media following the meeting, the former president said they discussed about the latest incidents and that immediate measures should be taken to prevent tense situation from aggravating.
?We request everyone to respect rule of law, maintain law and order and not to hurt anyone belongs to different ethnic communities. We all should act responsibly,? he said.
He said he was surprised at the silence maintained by the government over the aggravating?issue. ?The State of Emergency should have been imposed before,? he said.
Meanwhile, he said some elements want to spread the notion that the majority community was intimidating the minority communities in the country. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

State of Emergency: No immediate impact on tourism - SLTDA
	
While claiming that there is no immediate impact on tourism sector from the declaration of State of Emergency, the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) yesterday said it has backup plans for any tour plan disruptions.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, SLTDA Communication Consultant Rasika Jayakody said that there would be no harm to tourists from the situation but there is a possibility of their tour plans being interrupted.
?The SLTDA and the Tourist Police are equipped with backup plans in case of any disruptions to transport or any other issues,? he said.
Mr. Jayakody said soon after the Government declared the State of Emergency SLTDA had special discussion with the relevant authorities to take necessary actions.
He said the police confirmed that State of Emergency was declared only to facilitate police actions.
?The Authority with the Tourism Police is closely monitoring the situation in Kandy which is a popular tourist destination. However, no grave incident was reported yesterday in the area posing any threat to tourists,? he said.
He said the SLTDA had informed the embassies and travel agents to give the right picture over the situation to the international community as it could badly affect the tourism sector if unnecessary panic was created among the tourists.
Meanwhile, SLTDA hotline 1912 would be open for more information or to report any inconvenience situation to the tourists. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

WASHINGTON AFP March6, 2018? ?
Despite President Donald Trump?s public statements appearing to oppose sanctions against Russia, the steps ordered by Congress will be imposed in coming weeks, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday.? ?
In testimony before a House subcommittee, Mnuchin pushed back against the idea that Trump is trying to block the sanctions in response to Russia?s meddling in the 2016 US presidential election, saying Trump is ?fully supportive.? ?We will implement them,? Mnuchin said. ?I expect in next several weeks we?ll be going forward with sanctions on Russia.? Trump?s vocal opposition to the package -- which entered into law earlier this year -- and his regular praise of Vladimir Putin has raised questions about whether the administration is dragging its feet, which has angered some lawmakers.? ?
Several members of Trump?s campaign have been charged or admitted to lying to the FBI about their contacts with Kremlin-linked officials accused of trying to sway the 2016 vote in Trump?s favor.? ?
Mnuchin assured the legislators that ?in recent conversations with the president he is fully supportive of the work we are doing,? and that the sanctions will be enforced.? ?

The United States, Britain and Australia had issued travel advisories regarding Sri Lanka, following the violence in the Kandy District and the declaration of State of Emergency for a period of one week.
The US State Department advised US citizens to monitor local media updates as further incidents could occur in the next few days.
?The Sri Lankan Government declared a State of Emergency and curfews have been imposed in some regions, including Kandy Administrative District, due to communal unrest. Further incidents possible over the next few days. Monitor local media for updates,? the US State Department tweeted.
The UK Foreign Office advised British citizens to exercise caution, avoid protests and rallies and comply with local security requirements.
?The Sri Lankan government announced a nationwide state of emergency in response to recent incidents of inter-communal violence in Ampara and Kandy. The state of emergency may include curfews in specific locations across the country. You should exercise caution, avoid protests and rallies, and comply with local security requirements,? the foreign office stated.
The Australian Foreign Ministry requested the Australian travellers to avoid protests and large public gatherings as they have the potential to turn violent and exercise normal safety precautions while in Sri Lanka.
?The Sri Lankan Government declared a nationwide State of Emergency for 10 days due to incidents of communal unrest. Avoid protests and large public gatherings as they have the potential to turn violent.
Monitor local media and follow instructions issued by local authorities. The level of our advice has not changed. Exercise normal safety precautions in Sri Lanka,? it said.

A ?neutral character? for the coveted job?
	
?
Most Green party members favour the proposal to offer the controversial war hero the law and order portfolio now being held by the Green leader, they say.
?
However, a billionaire businessman with a blood tie to a very high authority has put his foot down that this portfolio should not go to the war hero under any circumstances.?
The kinsman?s strong objection has reportedly sent down the drain all efforts made by the doctor in the top team to put his soldier friend in charge of the key portfolio.?
The big boss who has the final say in the matter has now decided to offer the portfolio to a ?neutral character?, they say.?

A politico between two worlds!
	
?
There was a state level purohita hailing from a long standing political family in a distant area well-known for its vegetable cultivation.?
?
The politico was long nursing a grudge against the party leadership for failing to offer him a high position in keeping with his seniority and his standing in the district.?
By the way, it was a long cherished desire of his to introduce his son to politics as a candidate at the upcoming provincial polls.?
However, the results of the recent mini-poll gave him a jolt and made him entertain second thought about fielding his son as a Green party candidate at the upcoming provincial polls.??
So the man quietly met the former strongman and got an assurance from him that they would field his son on the Pohottuwa list at the coming provincial polls.?
After clinching the political deal, the politico set about the business of grooming the son as a Pohottuwa candidate.? Meanwhile, came the reshuffling of the pack and the politico got an unexpected elevation to a higher rung!
Our sources say that the unforeseen promotion has left the politico in a terrible quandary: he is unable to make up his mind as to whether he should continue to ride the elephant back or to give in to the allure of Pohottuwa!?

Access restricted to certain social media: Minister
	
Telecommunications,?Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment?Minister Harin Fernando today said extraordinary measures were taken to restrict access to certain social media websites and phone messaging applications.
In a statement, the minister said these measures have been taken by the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission?(TRC)?as an extraordinary but temporary response to limit the increasing spread of hate speech and violence through social media websites and phone messaging applications.
?The last few days have seen technology created to bring people together,?being used to pull people apart. Social media websites such as Facebook, Whatsapp and Viber - which were created to bring us closer to our friends and family and make communication free and convenient, have been used to destroy families, lives and private property.
I don?t need to remind the young people of this country that hate, violence and discrimination robbed you of a life full of opportunity and a country full of prosperity.
Do not make the mistakes of our past generations. You have today an opportunity to create a Sri Lanka where everyone can live in peace and prosperity. You have in your hands, technology that our forefathers didn?t even imagine was possible. These technologies are the fruits of peace and their purpose is the pursuance of peace and unity amongst all people, no matter their race, religion, caste or gender.
When you spread hate and violence against anyone, you will not only sow the seeds of suffering towards others but suffering towards yourself. You will secure this land of ours as one of eternal pain and lost opportunity. Don?t be a part of making that history because you can be a part of making something better. A Sri Lanka that is better for everyone. A Sri Lanka that shines as a beacon of hope to the rest of the world. A Sri Lanka that has used the fruits of peace to create a garden of unity, strength and opportunity for all our people. Be a part of that history. ?
Put down your smart phones, let go of your hate and help make a new Sri Lanka that is good for everyone,? Minister Fernando said.

Another rags-to-riches story!
	
?
A story doing rounds in political circles says that a powerful politico from the central hills had recently purchased a block of 109-perch prime land in the city at Rs. 3 million a perch.
?
The politico is said to be the owner of three residences in the city alone. He also owns lands and other property including a posh mansion in Kandy and several other towns in the upcountry, they say.?
It is a source of wonderment to many as to how this politico who once could not afford to buy a push cycle to come to Kandy could amass such immense wealth within so short a time. This politico eternally at loggerheads with a holder of high office in the upcountry is said to be planning to take up residence abroad as it is a cinch that he would lose at the upcoming polls.

Aranayaka Victims Left in the Lurch
	
A group of men and women sit under a thatched hut, just outside a temporary camp hidden in plain sight, in the town of Dippitiya, Aranayaka. The dilapidated hut is home to 14 families when the sweltering heat inside their tents is unbearable. The women sit accompanying their children with cloth covering their heads, as the shelter does little to give them cover against the scorching sun. The young ones attend to their homework, on makeshift tables, while their mothers look on.??
Some tents stress the need for better sanitation and underlying health issues, especially when the campsite is home to?15 children
	These families had received a weekly relief allowance of Rs. 700 for only three weeks along with dry rations
	A similar camp site in Deiyannawala, houses 22 displaced families
?
In the raw days after the 2016 landslide in Aranayaka, politicians queued to deliver promises of restoring normalcy to lives affected by the disaster. Accordingly, a larger number of the victims were relocated at temporary housing, while others have received compensation or moved into housing provided by the Government. Still others who can afford housing, have sought to occupy rented houses. This unfortunate group of fifteen families who was unable to do so, has been in these tents for almost two years now.? ?
?It really doesn?t matter if it rains or not,? says one victim. ?When the skies are clear, the heat is unbearable. Although we are used to living in camps for almost two years, the humid tents are merciless when the temperature rises. We get no rest during the day or at night,? the victim goes on. A glimpse into life inside a tent is enough to attest to this statement. These families sleep on soiled mattresses laid out on the ground, some lined with plastic sheets, and covered with mended mosquito nets. The children, aged as young as four and five, eager to show us their living quarters, crawl into the tents to show us where they play, right next to a single burner stove and a small cylinder of gas, where they keep several pots and pans.? ?
Come the monsoons, their lives take a turn for the worse, we learn. ?When it rains, we have to pull out and dry everything inside the tents, from mattresses to clothes, with the little amount of sunlight we get. With every rainfall, this ground is easily flooded. We can?t even cook our meals during the rain. All of us huddle under the hut where it is safer,? says another victim. Their tents are in a state of decay and worsens with every shower of rain. Even when the rains subside, not only does it leave dampened spirits, but also an intolerable stench, which does not wane for weeks.? ?
A distinct mud like odour fills the air of the campsite. Even though several NGOs have erected boards indicating safe sanitation practices, residents say managing sanitary waste has been a nightmare. ?We have to clean the septic pits ourselves every time the toilets overflow. We have made several requests to the authorities to assist us, but ultimately we rely on ourselves to clean the area,? one man says. Some tents where rodents have gnawed into, creating gaping holes, stress the need for better sanitation and underlying health issues, especially when the campsite is home to 15 children.? ?
Immediately after the disaster, these families had received a weekly relief allowance of Rs. 700 for only three weeks along with dry rations. The families of the Dippitiya camp are residents of Galbokka, Narangala and Pallebokke, areas surrounding the Samasara hill, identified as high-risk zones following the deadly landslide. Since the evacuation, these families have had no income. This displaced agricultural community was once heavily dependent on the income of crops such as tea, coffee, pepper and areca nut. Now that they have left their abode atop the hill, these families have been rendered helpless.
??From time to time, we visit our lands on top of the hill, where we have some crops left. But we can?t afford to do it everyday. The distance and the cost are too much,? some of the residents say. A considerable number of victims who cannot bear the costs or the life in these camps have returned to their homes on top of the Samasara hill, which was declared a high-risk evacuation zone.? ?
?Housing delayed?
The camp in Dippitiya is not the only site in Aranayaka which houses the displaced. A similar camp site in Deiyannawala, houses 22 displaced families. Yet, unlike these families, they have been provided with water and electricity. Interestingly this camp site is not their first settlement. Until December, the displaced had taken refuge in Ussapitiya grounds in Aranayaka. They had been asked to evacuate the ground, so that the district administration could host a musical show there on December 29. In December they had also been promised new houses built with the aid granted by the Government of China. Residents claim that their house numbers have been allocated as well. ?Authorities have already allocated houses within the newly constructed housing complex in Ruwandeniya, Ussapitiya. But they have not informed us of a date to move in,? claims one resident of the Dippitiya camp.? ?
The China - Sri Lanka Friendship Village in Ruwandeniya constructed with Rs. 22.5 billion worth financial assistance from the Government of China was expected to shelter 60 families by the end of 2017. However, victims say that even though the construction of the housing complex has been completed, several factors including the Local Government Elections have delayed the granting of these houses.? ?
The Daily Mirror spoke to Divisional Secretary of Aranayaka Z.A.M. Faizal to find the reasons for this delay. Faizal says the Divisional Secretariat is unable to provide exact details as the Chinese Ambassador is yet to provide a date to vest the Ruwandeniya village to the public. ?We are processing the documents of ownership for victims of the disaster. But due to the delay on part of the embassy we have been unable to give a specific date. A new ambassador was appointed which was one reason for the delay. We expect to finalise a date within the next week and open the village to the public with the presence of the Minister and Chinese diplomats,? says Faizal.? ?
The China - Sri Lanka Friendship Village in Ruwandeniya constructed with Rs. 22.5 billion worth financial assistance from the Government of China was expected to shelter 60 families by the end of 2017. However, victims say that even though the construction of the housing complex has been completed, several factors including the Local Government Elections have delayed the granting of these houses.
According to Faizal, the China - Sri Lanka Friendship Village was initially expected to be a compound of 100 houses. Only 60 of these houses have been constructed so far under the first phase and the remainder will be constructed under the second phase of the project. ?We have provided housing to all those who lost their homes in the disaster. The people living in the two camps in Aranayaka are only those who were evacuated from the high-risk zones. All 586 displaced victims of the disaster will be provided with housing by the Government when these 60 houses are vested in public,? adds Faizal.? ?
?In dire straits?
While some of the landslide victims remain in camps, members of another group are struggling to restore their lives to normalcy. Under the National Insurance scheme for Natural Disasters every small and medium scale industry damaged due to natural disasters is entitled to an insurance coverage of up to a maximum of Rs. 2.5 million, paid based on damage assessment. The first installment of Rs. 40,000 was given to beneficiaries who expressed willingness to construct houses in Government or private lands using their labour to prepare the land. The next five installments were to be released for beneficiaries when they complete the foundation and the roof, construct the walls up to the linton level, finish doors, windows, plastering and painting.? ?
Premasiri, an ageing cultivator who has been relocated to Dippitiya, is now a beneficiary of this scheme. It was not all plain sailing for this cultivator however. His original residence is in Siripura, Elangipitiya on top of the Samasara hill. Before the landslide, Premasiri was a self-sufficient man with acres of cultivated tea and other commercial crops. Under the compensation scheme, to be eligible for compensation of one million and six hundred thousand rupees, he had to completely demolish his residence in the estate on Samasara hill. ?The Government has allowed us to reap the profits of our cultivations. Therefore every other day we visit the estate on top of the hill,? he says. This journey takes one bus ride and a 4 km trek up the hill from his current residence in Dippitiya. ?We are not allowed to do anything in our estates, except to reap the produce. But as we don?t live their anymore, villagers take to our produce before we do. We are left with no income and we now have nothing to sell. Our only income is from a small portion of tea leaves we are able to gather every now and then,? he lamented.? ?
Even though Premasiri?s story is a more fortunate one, it was clear that he has been swindled off the little money he had, when we visited his new abode. The house has been constructed in the corner of a paddy field, converted into a landfill, a cost bearing exercise. Premasiri?s faith in a Government contractor to construct his new house has been futile as they now live in a poorly constructed house with makeshift doors. ?We received no compensation for over a year now. I am yet to receive the final installment of my housing compensation. The trek uphill is difficult as I am old now. It is difficult to make ends meet,? he grumbles.? ?
U.G Senevirathne, another cultivator of Bakulwala, says he has only received 800,000 rupees of the housing compensation. ?The authorities have asked us to completely demolish our houses. But we visit the estates often to collect the produce. As we have destroyed our houses, we have no place to even cook from or take shelter when it rains. Workers no longer seek employment in these estates ever since the disaster. We must pluck the tea ourselves. To travel from our new home to the estate the bus fare alone comes up to Rs. 200. The Government must look into our needs,? stresses Senevirathne.? ?
Some residents speaking to? fear to disclose their identities as they believe it would impede the payment of compensation or the provision of housing. They have received the blunt end of the stick even when their pleas are heard, victims say.? ? ?

??ask her not to be too big for her shoes!?

The Betel leaf bigwigs have reportedly invited a dainty fair Green party Diyawanna member elected from the Colombo district to join their ranks.
?
A gabby purohita from the central hills and a ?tie-coat? politico from the Colombo district had already discussed the matter with the fair member, they say.
After making a positive response to the proposition, the fair member had asked for a place in the top team in yahapalanaya as an incentive for her crossover.?
However, the purohita from the hills had pointed out that it was not fair for her as a newcomer to Diyawanna to expect a place in the top team adding that they could arrange a deputy office for her.
However, she had put her foot down saying, ?You have to consider the fact that I will have to sacrifice a chief organizer post. Besides, I will be taking a big political risk if I decide to quit my party.?
The purohita had told her that they would try to accommodate her request and the discussion had ended on this tentative note.? On being briefed on the outcome of the discussion with the fair one, the big boss had told the purohita, ?You just ask her not to be too big for shoes!??

A Green party bigwig who once held a key portfolio tried his level best in the recent past to regain a niche in the hierarchy.
?
However, both Number One and Number Two were forced to turn down his appeals made through third parties due to a howl of protests that arose from several quarters.?
Not to be outdone, the politico had got hold of a few vociferous Green backbenchers and after hosting them to a grand treat had told them: ?You all have suffered an injustice just like me! Therefore, we have to put up a good fight, but we have to plan out a strategy to make it a success!?
After working out the nitty-gritty of their plan, the big politico sent a faithful member from Kurunegala to meet a Blue party senior from the hills who once got into hot water by talking out of turn.?
According to what has down the grapevine so far, the emissary had asked the senior one from the hills to take the initiative to dislodge several Green bigwigs from the seats they are currently occupying in yahapalanaya.?
Having received a positive response, the big politico and his faithfuls are now awaiting with bated breath a sensational major move from the Blue seniors, they say.

Call for all-party conventions: JHU tells Prez
	
Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) General Secretary Minister Champika Ranawaka today requested President Maithripala Sirisena to call for all-party and multi-religious conventions in the wake of the tense situation in the country.
The minister said an isolated incident triggered communal violence and that such incidents take place in the country regularly.
While stating that effective measures should be taken to prevent such events from aggravating further, the minister recommended establishing a Rapid Deployment Force (RDF) unit in every police station to respond to such situations.
He suggested that intelligence reports be analysed and evaluated on time to identify such threats.
Furthermore, the minister encouraged the participation of religious leaders in taking decisions regarding such conventions.
?Effective steps should be taken to prevent politicians from gaining cheap mileage over the tense situation in the country. The dissemination of false news on war heroes should also stop forthwith. The law should be equally enforced on all ethnicities. I hereby request the public not to clash with security personnel and religious leaders not to influence any community against another. Also, the media have a crucial role of reporting incidents responsibly,? he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
