Fitch publishes Amana Bank?s rating of ?BB(lka)?; Outlook Stable
	
		 		 
		 
			
Fitch Ratings Lanka has published Sri Lanka-based Amana Bank PLC?s (Amana) National Long-Term Rating at ?BB(lka)? with a Stable Outlook.
Amana?s rating reflects its small and developing domestic franchise, and limited track record. The bank started operations in 2011 as a Sharia-compliant bank and accounted for 0.5 percent of total banking sector assets at end-2014.
The rating also captures Amana?s relatively high risk appetite, primarily indicated through exceptionally fast growth. This has put pressure on its capitalisation and could lead to deterioration in asset quality as loans season.
Amana is entirely funded by deposits, and benefits from having current and savings accounts make up 50 percent of the deposit base. The absence of high-quality, Sharia-compliant liquid investments, such as Sri Lanka government securities, weighs on its rating. Fitch believes the bank adequately manages the currency risk stemming from foreign-currency denominated placements.
The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch?s expectation the bank will receive a material capital infusion during 2015 that will allow it to comply with regulatory minimum requirements. In addition, Fitch expects the bank to turn profitable after it posted a profit in 4Q14.
Amana?s Fitch core capital ratio declined to 14.1 percent of risk weighted assets at end-2014, from 21 percent at end-2013, largely due to the rapid expansion of its loan book. The bank needs to increase its capital base by 1 January 2016 to Rs.10 billion from the current Rs.5 billion. This is to comply with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka?s requirements for all licensed commercial banks.
Fitch believes that the bank?s high operating cost base and potential increase in credit costs could continue to hamper its operating profitability and internal capital generation. Its cumulative loss in 2014 was Rs.80 million, or 1.6 percent of equity.
The bank?s loan book expanded by 69 percent in 2014 (2013: 110 percent). Of the bank?s gross loans at end-2014, 54 percent were to consumers and SMEs, which, in Fitch?s view, are more vulnerable if economic conditions deteriorate, and likely to lead to an increase in the NPL ratio, which stood at 1.5 percent at end-2014.

Video: Government not affected by defeat ? Ravi K.
	
	Condemning the unparliamentary move to defeat the finance regulation, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake yesterday maintained that the government was not least affected by this but assured to continue with granting the already proposed concessions to the people.
	The Minister said the already decided concessions to Samurdhi recipients and the funds allocated to purchase paddy will be granted as planned but the additional concessions which the government was hoping to give would be hindered because of this move.
	Lashing out at what he called the unethical attack on the Parliamentary traditions by Mahinda Rajapaksa backed faction, the Minister said only the general public would be further burdened by this move.
	Stating that there is no necessity to go for an early dissolution of Parliament, Mr. Karunanayake said 175 MPs will support the government in future and this unexpected vote cannot decide its strength.
	Addressing a late evening media briefing he added that the government?s sole purpose of bringing up this regulation was to reduce the burden placed on the people with huge debts by the previous regime.
	Deputy Minister of Policy Planning Dr. Harsha de Silva said this was nothing unusual but one of the treasury management methods. ?We were expecting this to work and reduce high debt to low debt ultimately giving a huge relief to the common man? he stated.
	Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella said following the assurance by Opposition Leader MP Nimal Siripala de Silva not to go for a voting on the regulations yesterday morning, this unparliamentary move shows only a division in the Opposition. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

Video: Leading florist caught selling foreign liquor
	
A leading florist reputed for its flowers, chocolates and gift packs was raided by sleuths of the Excise Department City Office today for selling seasonal gift hampers which included bottles foreign liquor.
This company is not licenced to sell alcoholic beverages.
The Excise sleuths acting on a complaint received by Excise Commissioner General L.K.G. Gunawardena placed an order through the award-winning florist?s website which displayed various gift hampers for the National New Year festive season.
Excise Spokesman and Superintendent Prabath Jayawickrama who led the raid said the sleuths in the guise of members of the corporate sector had paid an advance for the hampers which included bottles of foreign liquor and asked that the hampers be delivered to an office at Kalapaluwawa in Rajagiriya.
The goods were then collected by a team of Excise officials who were at Rajagiriya and arrested the three employees of Flora while three other teams raided the florist?s head office in Nawala and branches in Negombo and Kandy.
Six employees including a manager were arrested and a stock of foreign liquor worth more than Rs.500,000 taken in to custody. The brands comprised Chivas Regal, Napoleon Brandy, several varieties of wine and cans of beer.
Mr. Jayawickrama alleged that the florist had violated Excise laws of selling and trafficking in liquor without a license. The arrested suspects will be produced in Courts.
Meanwhile, the investigations are continuing to locate the storeroom used by the company to store the alcoholic beverages. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana and Darshana Sanjeewa)CLICK HERE TO VIEW PICTURESWATCHVideo by Darshana Sanjeewa

	The mother of a handicapped student of a leading girl?s school in Colombo has complained to the Human Rights Commission over the shifting her handicapped daughter?s class room to the third floor of the building much to her inconvenience.
	She said she and her husband had to carry their handicapped daughter and the wheel chair to the class room on the third floor and noted that on one occasion she had fallen on the staircase while carrying her handicapped daughter.
	The mother said that her father who came to help her had now been informed that he should refrain from coming to school so often and that her request to shift the class to the ground floor had fallen on the deaf ears.
	She told the Human Rights Commission that these events had compelled her daughter to remain at home.
	Meanwhile, Ceylon Teacher Association General Secretary Joseph Stalin said it was sad that a handicapped girl had lost the opportunity and the right to be educated because of the steps taken by the school administration and that it was a violation of her fundamental rights.

Issuing a statement the company said that, the Project Company has requested for an opportunity to express its concerns regarding the temporary suspension to the GoSL appointed Review Committee, and is willing to fully corporate with the committee during the review process. ?
The Project Company complied with the suspension notice issued on March 6, 2015 immediately and as per the directive given by the Sir Lankan Government, submitted copies of all permits and approvals within two working days. The Company notes these permits and approvals were originally issued by the relevant competent authorities of the Government of Sri Lanka and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), clearly directing the Project Company to commence reclamation work of the Colombo Port City.
In keeping with the agreement signed between the Project Company and the Sri Lankan Government, the responsibility for securing approvals and permits relating to the project is vested with the Government of Sri Lanka and SLPA, whilst the commercial risk of the project is being absorbed by the Project Company, as the total project development cost of approximately USD 1.4 billion, is invested by the Project Company.

The EIA study was approved by the TEC and the Coast Conservation Department, the project-approving agency.
The Project Company has prepared detailed feasibility reports that have been evaluated by the international lenders to the project, prior to drawing down of the debt component. Such studies include detailed reports prepared by Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) and CB Richard Ellis (CBRE), the world?s largest real estate consultancy companies. Matters relating to infrastructure design, availability and utilization have been addressed by international consultants Atkins of UK, AECOM of USA and SWECO of Sweden, and over several months discussed and documented with Government agencies such as National Water Supply & Drainage Board (NWSDB) and the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB). ?
Further, the land allocation in terms of the concession agreement was negotiated and agreed between the Sri Lanka Government and the Project Company, taking into consideration inter alia all aforesaid matters and in particular, the fact that the total cost of the project is financed by the Project Company.

Parliamentarian Tiran Alles along with five other Directors of the Radha Company were barred from leaving the country by the Fort Magistrate?s Court in connection with alleged fraud in companies purportedly set up to reconstruct houses for tsunami-affected people, Police said.
They said Shanthi Kumar, Gajan Kumar and their mother Anandi Shanthi Kumar, said to be directors of a fake company named Oomps textiles Ltd., were also arrested and produced in the Colombo Magistrate?s Court today.
Police said the Radha Company established in 2006 under the Chairmanship of MP Tiran Alles for the purpose of constructing houses for Tsunami-affected people in the East Coast had obtained Rs.645 million from the Treasury with the approval of the Presidential Secretariat but that no houses were constructed.
They said the companies, ?B.M.K. Holdings? and ?Everest Civil Engineering? also set up for the purpose of reconstructing houses for Tsunami affected people in the East coast, were not registered and bore false addresses.
The Police confirmed that the funds collected by the Radha Company were credited to Oomps textiles Ltd., through the abovementioned fake companies and that Rs.125 million of the funds allocated by the Treasury were fraudulently misappropriated.
They said the Radha Company was shut down in 2006, the same year it was set up.
The State funds that been paid to Oomps Textiles Ltd. had been taken over by Mr. Alles and former LTTE activist Emil Kanthan.WATCH

National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ) Leader Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera today urged political parties not to oppose the 19th Amendment, because it was one of the much awaited Constitutional reforms and that this opportunity would not present itself again.
?We have a message for all political parties and for every citizen in the country. This is a pivotal juncture in this country?s future, because on March 10 the 19th Amendment will be presented in Parliament.
?This is one of the main promises in the election manifesto. Ranil, Chandrika, several political parties, trade unions and university professors supported the common candidate based on the promise and assurance of abolishing the executive presidency. It should be abolished and this is the person entrusted to carry out this promise. Since it is happening now I urge parties not to oppose it because such an opportunity will never come our way again,? the Thera said.
He said parties agree on the need to abolish the executive presidency and they agree that there should be electoral reforms but they are not agreed on what the reforms should be.
?This is nothing new to the SLFP; they have encountered this issue before. Parties such as the JVP, the Sama Samaja Party, the Left Parties and even the UNP have opposed the executive presidency.
?All parties are also opposed to the current electoral system and agree that a new system should be adopted. If everyone agrees then why is it so difficult to carry it out,? he said. (Jehan Gunasekara and Sanath Desmond)

Yoshitha?s motor spare parts business through SriLankan-UNP
	
Yoshitha Rajapaksa, one of Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa?s sons, carried out a motor spare parts business through the State-run SriLankan Airlines abusing his father?s powers, UNP Spokesman and Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam alleged at a media conference today.
The Minister levelled the accusations based on the recently issued Weliamuna Report, which highlighted many transactions, manipulations of service contracting, recruitment of unqualified staff and major in-flight security breaches at SriLankan Airlines during the time of former government.
The Minister said that the SriLankan Airline's London Manager, who noticed and opposed Yoshitha?s business, had been transferred with immediate effect as a result of an order from the former President.
?The order had been given by the former president. We don?t want to take revenge from anybody. But, people should be aware of the truth and what the whole Rajapaksa family did to our country by exploiting public money for their satisfaction. Even flights had been changed by them for their personal matters,? Kariyawasam said.
He also thanked Attorney J.C. Weliamuna for finishing the report on time so that government would be able to file criminal action against the wrongdoers.
The statement on the report, issued on Saturday by the Prime Minister?s office, charged gross abuse of power by Airline?s former Chairman Nishantha Wickramasinghe. (Piyumi Fonseka)
