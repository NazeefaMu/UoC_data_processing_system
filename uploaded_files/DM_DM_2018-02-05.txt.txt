Aloysius' arrest only a drama: JVP
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today the arrest of Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) owner Arjun Aloysius was a plan hatched to serve a political agenda.
JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said it was clear that Mr. Aloysius was prepared for his arrest because he was dressed in a white shirt and tie at the time.
This arrest is just another episode in the drama. Aloysius and his wife were seen well-dressed at the time of the arrest. When an ordinary person is arrested, he is taken away as he is, he said.
Mr. Dissanayake said action against fraudsters was being expedited on the eve of the election to achieve political objectives and not as a means of preventing fraud and corruption. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Audit Bill to be presented to Cabinet this week
	
The much-delayed Audit Bill is expected to be presented to the Cabinet of Ministers this week, sources close to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
They said the Government had decided to go ahead with passing the Bill as the Supreme Court had given the nod for it.
Accordingly, the Attorney General had informed the Secretary to Prime Minister that the Bill was in accordance with the Constitution.
The Bill, sources said would give wide powers to the Attorney General on making public institutions more accountable.
However, there was a notion among some sectors of the Government that the Bill would put State Officials in jeopardy. (Yohan Perera)

Gnanananda Thera to lodge HR complaint against Uva CM
	
The Joint Association of Unemployed Graduates Convener Thanne Gnanananda Thera has said he will complain to the Human Rights Commission (HRC) tomorrow about the Uva Chief Minister Chamara Sampath Dassanayake having attempted to assault him.
The monk said new evidence with regard to the incident where the Uva CM had attempted to assault him sometime ago had cropped up, paving the way for him to seek the help of the authorities.
He told Daily Mirror that he and several members of the association members met the CM some three months ago to request for a discussion on the issues faced by teachers in the Uva Province.
The monk said he was threatened and he and the association's members pushed out the office.
He said though the police were at the scene they were of no help and no complaints made at the the time because of the lack of evicence.
We were surprised to see that someone had recorded the entire incident and had released it to social media websites though it was somewhat late. With the video footage showing what exactly happened and the CMs behaviour at the time, we thought of filing legal action against him, the Thera said.
He said CMs behaviour was tarnishing the image of the government.
The Thera said right to employment, health and education was a fundamental right and the people have a right to fight for their demands if the authorities failed to fulfil them.
He said there were more than 50,000 unemployed graduates in the country therefore they would not rest until those graduates received what they deserved. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Move to skip bond report debate on sub judice: SLPP
	
The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) said today there was a plan by the government to sidestep the parliamentary debate on the bond commission report by saying the matter was sub judice.
SLPP Chairman G.L. Peiris said the government had repeatedly attempted to block the debate on bond commission report.
He said the President received the report on December 30, last year.
After a long delay,the report was released on January 17, 2018 with something strange happening on February 2. A'B' report was filed in the Magistrates Court on Arjuna Mahendran, Arjun Aloysius and Kasun Palisena with Court preventing the alienation of their properties to any third party.There is a plan to raise the sub judice issue in Parliament to prevent the debate from taking place. The argument is that the matter is now in court and therefore the debate is not possible. This is absolute nonsense, he told a news briefing.
Prof. Peiris said the debate was about a wide ranging report prepared by a presidential commission in which two Supreme Court judges sat.
If the debate was dissolved for sub judice reason, then any matter of public importance may be avoided from beingdebated in Parliament by simply filing a B report in a magistrates court, he said and added that it was the duty of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to allow the debate to proceed.
Hesaid the government tried from the beginning to dilute the gravity of the bond report by coupling it up with the PRECIFAC report and pointed out that the arrest of Arjun Aloysius and Kasun Palisena without the arrest of former Central Bank governor Arjuna Mahendran is similar to Hamlet without the Prince.

## Title: Pathiraja:  An accessible GENIUS

Pathiraja:  An accessible GENIUS
	
Again, one is shaken out of a great complacency. Like the ominous black-clad Knight in Ingmar Bergmans the Seventh Seal, death carried Dharmasena Pathiraja away from us. The complacency was on my part. Not that one expected artistic immortality to extend into the realm of physical existence. Though he had been ailing for some time, he seemed healthy enough for another decade of life when I met him less than six months ago. Suddenly, he was gone at 74, at a time when artistically he was riding his second wind, making Sakkarang and the enigmatic Swaroopa in 2014.
He never compromised in his art and this iron will reflected in his death, too. He wanted the simplest of funerals and got his wish. There were no political speeches and no lobbies vying to hijack his body. True to his secular beliefs, Pathiraja the materialist (as he called himself) did not want sermons at his funeral, hence no clergy were invited. It was carried out in such a short time that some of his closest friends missed it.
Pathiraja correctly judged that its the body of his work, and not his lifeless cadaver, that would be of any value to posterity. To my mind, Pathirajas name ranks alongside that of Lester James Pieris. Both can be called humanists. Lesters humanism came filtered through the westernised, bourgeois world he inhabited. Patharajas political views were radical (Marxist-Trotskyte) but he never wore them on his sleeve. Apart from a brief spell as a university student activist, he remained aloof from political activism, and was never part of JVP radical activity, the natural milieu for many students dreaming of socio-political change in that era. There was nothing radical about his appearance, either, and though he had a doctorate on Bengali cinema, he was Pathi to everyone, not Dr. Pathiraja.
His humanist world view was filtered though his own innate sense of humanism springing from lower middle class societal values. Though he disowned Buddhist influences, the gentle non-political Buddhist stream of thought which fashioned the Sri Lankan psyche until it was overwhelmed by its virulently nationalist, militant and politicised alter ego too, would have played a key role in his art, which believes in making strong statements without laying it on too thick. But his humanism was universal and never channelled into the tunnel vision of religious dogma. It strongly influenced his very moderate views on the ethnic issue, though that won him few friends in the world of art or politics, where most people settled for hardline views.
"Pathiraja was always secure in his fundamental beliefs, and about the quality of his art, and time has proved him right. He was also very fortunate that he peaked artistically with the best creative talents in our acting and related fields"
While Pathiraja could not have made Gam Peraliya and Lester could not have made Ahas Gawwa, there is something of Pathirajas muted radicalism in Lesters 1983 film Yuganthaya (about a mercenary industrialist challenged by his own son) and theres something of Nidhanaya (Lesters heightened artistic statement about a man whose greed for wealth overwhelms his better nature and capacity for love) in Pathirajas Bambaru Ewith and Ahas Gawwa. Unlike Marlon in Yuganthaya, Pathirajas jobless young men in Ahas Gawwa have no rich fathers to rebel against. But they wage their own heroic daily struggle against the Big Brother of ruthless urban exploitation, and in Bambaru Ewith, the demons who destroy Helen and her love are based on wealth and class. As an artist, Pathiraja achieved something rare anywhere in the world  his Ahas Gawwa came to define an entire generation of desperate young men, in the way that Ernest Hemingways novel The Sun Also Rises (in a different context) defined a lost generation of western youth following WWI.
Pathiraja was a master of the sweetest of ironies. In Soldadu Unnehe, Pemakka (Malani Fonseka) is a sex worker who goes hungry on an independence day as she cant find a client. Bambaru Ewith was about sexual and class exploitation. At another level, it is a study of the nature of illusion, another example of the filmmakers innate sense of Buddhist philosophy merging with his humanist politics. The same sense of karma at work is felt overwhelmingly in his last, ambitious work Swaroopa, based on Frank Kafkas the Metamorphosis. And his ever present sense of irony looms in it, too, when he takes a gentle dig at the commercial cinema with that unusual shot of a Morris Minor convertible disappearing into those misty hills, as if its occupants are ready to burst into song.

"Patharajas political views were radical (Marxist-Trotskyte) but he never wore them on his sleeve. Apart from a brief spell as a university student activist, he remained aloof from political activism, and was never part of JVP radical activity the natural milieu for many students dreaming of socio-political changein that era."
He was the Jean Renoir of Lankan cinema, albeit without any trade unions ready to buy tickets in advance to fund his films. Around 1990, he made a telefilm called Mee Peni Saha Alu for Swarnavahini. It was about the exodus of Muslim refugees caused by LTTE attacks in Kalpitiya. For reasons which are not clear, this film was never released.
Lack of funding meant that he made relatively few films during his lengthy career, but they amount to a significant body of work. Like Lester James Pieris, Pathiraja too, was unaffected by fads and trends from the West which sweep the world of art periodically. He was decidedly unimpressed by the tsunamis of post-modernist thinking which came into vogue here in the 1980s, which may be why he fell out of fashion with a new generation of writers and critics. Well read and a graduate in eastern and western culture, he was a little too much for a generation who seem to have read little else besides Derida and Foucault.
But Pathiraja was always secure in his fundamental beliefs, and about the quality of his art, and time has proved him right. He was also very fortunate (like Lester James Pieris) that he peaked artistically with the best creative talents in our acting and related fields, such as Malani Fonseka, Joe Abeywickrema, Wimal Kumara de Costa, and Premasiri Khemadasa as composer of that haunting score for Bambaru Ewith. This is an artistic combination of a calibre we are unlikely to see for a long, long time.
Much has been written about Dharmasena Pathiraja but Handunagaththoth Oba Ma (If only you could know me) would likely remain his epitaph. As his films remain unruffled by time, he remained unruffled by swiftly approaching death. If Bergmans medieval Knight of Death had actually come to meet him in Kandy, one imagines Pathiraja welcoming him with a smile, and getting into a conversation about the nature of life, until it was time to go.
