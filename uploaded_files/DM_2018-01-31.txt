Separatists seize Aden presidential palace
	

Yemeni security officials say the countrys prime minister is preparing to flee after separatists seized the presidential palace in the southern port city of Aden in fierce battles overnight. 
The officials say fighters loyal to the so-called Southern Transitional Council fought all way to the gates of the Palace of Maashiq  Arabic for lovers  in the district of Crater in Aden. The palace is the seat of Yemens internationally backed government.

They say Prime Minister Ahmed Obaid Bin Daghar is to leave the country imminently. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity under regulations. 
The fighting in Aden first erupted on Sunday, when a deadline issued by the separatists for the government toresign expired. 
President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi has described the separatists action as a coup. Earlier reports said at least 36 people have been killed and 185 wounded in two days of heavy fighting between separatists and government troops in Yemens interim capital of Aden, the Red Cross said.
Heavy fighting intensified at night after the two sides used tank and artillery on the second day of an attempted coup in the southern port city, military sources said.
The flare-up has added yet another dimension to one of the worlds most complicated conflicts, a civil war that has left thousands dead and millions on the brink of starvation.

Special High Courts to function by August: PM
	
The special high courts investigations on serious frauds will start functioning by August this year, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
The Prime Minister said this at an election rally in Gampaha last evening.
" Cabinet paper submitted by Minister of Justice Talatha Atthukorala was approved by the Cabinet today and it will be presented to Parliament soon. UNP's stand on the issue is that the new courts should initially hear the cases on corruption which has taken place during the present regime", Mr Wickremesinghe said.
" The practice that had been carried out in the past on corruption is that a new government conducts investigation on corruption that had taken place during the previous regime. However, this regime had changed this practice and conducted investigation on bond issue" he added.
He then went on to talk on the development plans lined up by the government for the country.
State Minister Ruwan Wijewardene said both the President and the Prime Minister had agreed to deal with corruption together. He said those in the UNP and in the SLFP will have to face punishment if it is proven that they have been engaged in corruption.
" There are some who were engaged in corruption during the Rajapaksa regime, who have become ministers in the present regime. Some who were alleged to have involved in the hedging deal have become ministers in this government and talking of corruption in this government. They will be penalized if found guilty" Mr Wijewardene said.
He also said the Opposition parties such as SLPP will not be able to carry out development in village level when the Central government is being run by another party. " How can one expect an Opposition MP from Kurunegala develop villages " he questioned. (Yohan Perera)

Sudden end to his innings for the country
	

It is a fact that has received general acceptance that our UN envoy Ravinath has ably and consistently protected the countrys image at the OHCHR in Geneva in the recent past.

A report says that Ravinaths assignment has been terminated and he is now back at the Foreign Ministry. It has also transpired that disagreement between Ravinath and the political authority on foreign affairs over some policy issues has led to his being called back here.
According to a story that has gone viral in diplomatic circles, Ravinath had once in writing expressed his reservations about an order given by the political authority in Colombo saying it was potentially prejudicial to the countrys interests.
Sri Lankans in Geneva are said to have expressed their deep concern over the country losing services of a capable and experienced envoy in Geneva over a minor issue like the difference of opinions.

Surprise discovery: Unsuspecting trio behind drug trafficking
	

Following reports that there is an unprecedented increase in the amounts of heroin and Kerala ganja being smuggled into the country, the intelligence sleuths who went into action on the orders of the main office, had uncovered the details of this latest phenomenon.

They had discovered that these narcotics were being brought to the spots along the Southern coast hidden in fishing boats that set out to sea from Negombo. The most surprising discovery the security sleuths have made is that the racketeers behind this operation are three leading politicos whose reputation is such that none would dare link their names to anything shady
or illicit!
The highest in the countrys political echelons is already in the know of the names of the Big Three behind this smuggling operation, they say.

Woman sues Japanese govt. over forced sterilisation
	

Tokyo, (Hindustan Times), 30 Jan 2018 - -A Japanese woman who was forcibly sterilised as a teenager due to intellectual disabilities sued the government on Tuesday in the first case of its kind, seeking compensation because her basic human rights had been trampled on.
Under Japans eugenics protection law, in force from 1948 to 1996, about 25,000 people were sterilised due to mental or genetic illnesses, Japanese media said. They included leprosy sufferers and some with intellectual and cognitive disabilities.
About 16,500 of them are believed to have had the surgery without their consent. The 60-year-old who sued had developed mental problems following surgery for a cleft palate as an infant and was diagnosed with an intellectual disability at 15, after which she was forcibly sterilised, media said, quoting court documents.
As the result of side-effects she later had to have her ovaries removed. Subsequently, marriage talks were broken off as a result of her inability to have children.

A large majority had not liked the attack on the high official whose integrity is considered above question, but they had silently suffered the harangue until a purohita hailing from a political family in the upcountry challenged the big man from the city. Dont criticize respectable people to cover up your own sins!
Later several members had endorsed what the upcountry purohita said and finding that he had incurred the displeasure of even the party heavyweights, the city politico now under a cloud wound up and sat down, they say.

A prominent Buddhist monk is on a hunt for a new face for a high political office in the country, they say.

The monk is known to have played a lead role in the popular movement that heavily campaigned to usher in yahapalanaya.
He has confided in his close associates about the high political office he has in his mind for the new ideal candidate he is looking for.
The prelate has already held consultations with several political party heavyweights in pursuit of his new mission which is reportedly backed by a powerful personality.
The monk is confident of finding the new face they are looking for in the near future though it is yet to appear on the horizon.
Some sections in yahapalanaya have welcomed the move by the monk while some others have reacted to the news with a grim face, they say.

A 21-salvo gun salute in vain
	

All arrangements had been made to accord a red carpet welcome with all state honours to the visiting head of government from Lion-city.

The guard of honour, the unfurling of the national flags and the singing of the national anthems of the two counties and all other customary formalities to honour the foreign visitor were duly observed at this ceremony where our own Number One was duly associated with the former.
Arrangements also had been made on the Galle Face Green to fire 21 salvoes in honour of the distinguished guest. However, the visitor from Lion-city and our own boss stepped down from the dais and walked away soon after the initial formalities and by the time the 21 salvoes were fired, both of them were nowhere near the venue of the state ceremony.
This incident is unprecedented in that no foreign dignitary in the countrys post-independence history had missed a 21-salvo gun-salute as on this occasion, they say.
This blunder had occurred due to the failure on the part of the foreign Ministry authorities concerned to brief the foreign visitor and our own boss on the arrangement, knowledgeable sources say.

The Kidneys, Liver, Corneas of the eyes and Bones of the legs of a woman who was brain dead consequent to the injuries which affected her head in a critical motor accident were removed from her body during an operation lasting more than five hours performed at the Homagama base hospital on Monday night.
With the completion of this operation, the removed Liver was transplanted to a patient warded at the Ragama Hospital and the Kidneys removed transplanted to two other patients at the Colombo National Hospital and at the Kidney Hospital in Maligawatte, stated the Director of the hospital Ms Subhashini Panduwawala .
The deceased from whose body these organs were removed is Benthara Hettiarachchige Thilini Jeewanthi Alwis (24) a mother of one child, resident of Padukka Kotigangoda.
Sources revealed that the deceased who had served as a lab assistant, had attended a wedding of a friend on January 27 and returning with her husband accompanying him on his Motor bicycle which had met with an accident and her husband had succumbed to the injuries he sustained, while she was admitted to the Colombo National Hospital with serious injuries.
While at the Colombo hospital the doctors ruled out that she cannot be cured as she had received serious injuries to her head and transferred to the Homagama base hospital. Exhaustive attempts made by the specialist doctors at the ICU of the Homagama hospital were not successful as by that time her brain had been dead.
The doctors at the hospital had then inquired from her relatives, even though her brain is dead some of the organs removed from her body could be donated to the patients who are ever hoping to continue living, by transplanting these removed organs. The doctors having obtained the permission from the father of the deceased and her relatives undertook this yeoman task of removing the identified organs.
A team of doctors headed by Colombo National Hospital Transplant Specialist Dr. Ruwan Dissanayake, Dr. Harendra De Silva, Dr. Prabodha Samarathunga, Dr. Samantha Silpage and Dr. Prasad Herath performed this rare feat, a first in the 72 year history of the Homagama Hospital.

## Title: Another 'Concrete' Money Spinner!

Another 'Concrete' Money Spinner!
	

The Wilpattu forest reserve made headlines with massive deforestation practices taking place over the past few years. Although these activities seem to be in a dormant stage as at now, the necessary damage has already been done. Last December, the Auditor General issued a comprehensive report on the illegally deforested Wilpattu Forest Reserve. Following this report, theDailymirror initially reported on the current status of this proposed resettlement project and the threats identified by environmental groups. However it seems that various other projects, including the Lower Malwatu Oya Project  a project paused for 30 years due to the ethnic conflict, have commenced operations once again.
Hence, theDailymirrorsheds light on the impact of this project which required clearing more than 19,000 acres of forest land, destroying more resources and imposing threats on endemic species in this forest reserve.
Other requirements for an EIA are as follows:

An EIA should be open for public inspection and comment for a mandatory period of 30 days. 
	Prescribed projects which do not have complex environmental issues require an Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) report. 
	The PAAs mentioned here are administrative agencies led by the CEA that are responsible for guiding the EIA for projects and issuing EIA approval or rejection. A single PAA is appointed as the appropriate PAA for each EIA by the CEA.

Forest Department should have cleared land prior to conducting an EIA
Speaking to theDailymirror, Kanthi De Silva, Deputy Director General  Environmental Management and Assessment Division (EMA) of the CEA said that an EIA is conducted only with regard to legal projects. But for this, the consent of the land owner is a prerequisite. Prior to starting an EIA the land clearing needs to be done. With regard to this particular issue in Wilpattu, where 700 acres were cleared for resettlement, the CEA was not aware of it to begin with. The Forest Department should have cleared this land prior to conducting an EIA.

If the project isnt approved by the Government the CEA should be informed
The process includes six steps from screening to scoping, preparation of the EIA report, review of the report by the public and the Project Approving Agency (PAA), approval with terms and conditions or rejection with reasons and post approval monitoring. If the project is not approved by the Government the CEA should be informed at the beginning,said De Silva.

EIA and EPC are currently being conducted

The above project falls under the purview of the Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources Management as a priority project. Speaking to the Dailymirror, Engineer Sisira Kumara, Secretary of the subject ministry, said that the Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract is currently being evaluated. The EIA too is being conducted via a company we selected to handle the necessary work. The Environmental authority requested us to submit an EIA which we will draft and send out for public opinion. The project will feed tributaries and the Yoda Wewa in Mannar. The project is currently at a negotiation stage and if we get the EIA approved, the project will proceed, said Kumara.

The EIA too is being conducted via a company we selected to handle the necessary work


President and everybody else has contributed to deforestation practices
Speaking at a press conference organised to expose findings about this Project, Ven. Waakadawala Rahula Thera said that with the implementation of the Mahaveli Development Project huge damage was caused to the environment. We know that there is a struggle to protect the rest of the natural resources left for us. The deforestation that took place during every regime has become a major social issue today.

The destruction of the Wilpattu-Kallaru Forest Reserve is part of a bigger development plan, known as the National Physical Plan 2011-2030

The destruction of the Wilpattu-Kallaru Forest Reserve is part of a bigger development plan, officially known as the National Physical Plan 2011-2030. There are various isolated protests to justify the alleged involvement of Minister Rishad Bathiudeen, but it is not only he who is to blame. The President, Environment Minister and every other regime that existed have actively contributed to these deforestation practices. The Lower Malwatu Oya Project is another one of those plans. For this purpose over 19,675 acres of land will be cleared as an initial step to carry out this project. As a result of these projects natural habitats are rapidly destroyed and it has imposed a threat on endemic species of flora and fauna,the Thera said.

19,000 acres of forest destroyed to give water to 2000 acres of land
Environmentalist and Centre for Environmental Studies (CENS) Executive Director Ravindra Kariyawasam said that in 2009 a road had been constructed via the Wilpattu Forest Reserve and its Northern Border, separating the habitat in two. From 2009 till 2016 this destruction had continued in various other places of the forest reserve as well. Therefore the Wilpattu National Park, Kallaru and Marichikaddu are directly affected by this destruction and adding to this is the Lower Malwatu Oya Project as mentioned by Ven. Rahula Thera. This project will be continued across the Malwatu Oya-Kappachchi area covering an area of 17,000 acres. As a result of this project the water capacity is expected to increase by 290 cubic metres and the water is to be distributed to the surrounding areas.
The Lower Malwatu Oya Project is a result of an agreement inked by the Sri Lankan and the Russian Governments back in 1960. But due to the 30-year-conflict this project was halted. Work in this project was commenced last year, but even then there was no Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) done. But the National Environmental Act No. 47 of 1980 specifies that if an area of more than two and a half acres is being cleared for any project, an EIA has to be done. If you take this project, 17,000 acres will dedicated to the project while another 675 acres of land to the west of the Thanthirimale-Cheddikulam Road have been allocated for resettlement. In addition to that another 2000 acres have been allocated for a fruit cultivation project. So in total, a 19,675 acre forest area will be allocated for this project. This extent of land also includes areas such as Sarattikulam, Bandiwewa and Sinnakkulam. When such a massive project has already been implemented, the Environmental Ministry and the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) have not shown any interest to carry out an EIA,said Kariyawasam.
When this excess water is reserved the Wilpattu National Park will not get adequate water
Speaking further Kariyawasam said that the assessment then needs to be presented to the public for reference. Therefore this is another illegal project. The dam will be constructed by a Chinese company and the income generated will be given back to the employees of this company who will be involved in constructing the project. Another important fact to note is that this project will only distribute water to another 2000 acres of land. But this area includes Yoda Wewa which supplies water to many paddy fields and other cultivations in the area. So to give water to an extra 2000 acres, a 19,000 acre area of forest land will be destroyed. As a result of this project many species of flora and fauna are facing threats.

The Lower Malwatu Oya Project is a result of an agreement inked by the Sri Lankan and the Russian Governments back in 1960.

Environmental studies conducted in this area have identified 41 species of mammals, 29 species of fish, 17 species of amphibians and 149 species of birds. These areas are also inhabited by elephants and they too could face a massive threat. The irrigation system which flows on either side of the Malwatu Oya and Kappachchi area will also be destroyed. The proposed project is said to lower the chances of floods occurring in the Vavuniya District, but it is clear that the villus in Wilpattu are fed by the excess water flowing from Malwatu Oya. When this excess water is reserved the Wilpattu National Park will not get adequate water. Therefore many paddy fields and other cultivations will be greatly affected. In other words it is quite impractical to implement a project which was proposed back in the 1960s and the necessary authorities need to open their eyes and look closely at the destruction caused by these projects, he added.


Forest cover in the country lies as low as 16%

Airing his views on the issue of deforestation, Dr.Prasanna Cooray said that it could lead to long periods of drought. One of the main contributors to global warming is deforestation and one of the countries that carry out deforestation is Sri Lanka. According to a research done by the University of Gothernberg, Sweden, Sri Lanka stands in fourth place in the list of countries that carry out deforestation at large. As a result of deforestation, the forest cover in the country lies as low as 16%, but the Government continues to show exaggerated figures. Development practices in the North and East should take place with the knowledge of those settled there. There are various issues with regard to resettlement approaches and uplifting their livelihoods. Without attempting to find any solution to these issues, it is very wrong that the Government continues to implement such unplanned projects which would cause more harm to the people,said Dr. Cooray.

Development practices in the North and East should take place with the knowledge of those settled there


Major concerns
One main concern in this clearing of forest land is that no Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was done given that it is a priority. Without conducting an EIA the authorities involved took their first illegal step in proceeding with the deforestation of Wilpattu Forest Reserve.
As more skyscrapers and concrete establishments are substituting the greenery it has imposed threats on both humans and animals
A country that once had a massive forest cover at present suffers with just 16% of greenery across the country. Cohabiting with other species is a necessity as trees and animals are active participants in the ecosystem. As more skyscrapers and concrete establishments are substituting the greenery across the country it has imposed threats on both humans and animals. The International Association of Impact Assessment (IAIA) defines an EIA as the process of identifying, predicting, evaluating and mitigating the biophysical, social and other relevant effects of development proposals prior to major decisions being taken and commitments made. In Sri Lanka, the National Environmental Act, 1998 requires EIAs for large scale projects in sensitive areas and is enforced by the Central Environmental Authority (CEA).

Be wary of friend requests: CERT
	
Principal Information Security Engineer of the Computer Emergency Readiness Team Co-ordination Centre (CERT|CC), Roshan Chandragupta said about 250 Facebook related complaints were received in January this year.
He said Facebook users must take extra care to ensure their safety and security on cyberspace such as when publishing their photographs under the friends only category.
Users of FB should keep in mind to add only those personally known to them and to avoid accepting requests from those of unknown origin, Mr. Chandragupta said.
He said CERT had received 3,400 complaints by December last year regarding the creation of fake Facebook accounts and that CERT had reported most of cases to the Facebook Head Quarters. Mr. Chandragupta said several of the complaints were made by the genuine users of Facebook accounts saying their names and photos were used for the fake Facebook accounts.
He said the FB head office had deleted some 80 per cent of the fake Facebook accounts by the end of last year. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Bond scam miscreants using Ravi as scapegoat: CaFFE
	
Referring to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's statement that it was only proper for MP Ravi Karunanayake to step down from his post as the UNP's assistant leader, Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) Executive Director Keerthi Tennakoon today said the major bond scam miscreants had used Mr. Karunanayake as a scapegoat.
Speaking with the Daily Mirror, Mr. Tennakoon said the Tilak Marapana-committee which was appointed to look into whether any UNPer was involved in the scam, had also recommended that Mr. Karunanayake should step down from his post as the assistant leader of the party and refrain from national political activities on behalf of the party.
Although it is evident that the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) report has revealed that Ravi was answerable to the allegation that the Aloysius Family and their Walt and Rowe Company had paid the rent for the penthouse apartment occupied by Mr. Karunanayake, his role in the bond scam was minute. We are not trying to wash Ravis clothes. What we are pointing out is that the major bond scam offenders including the PM are attempting to use Ravi to escape from the allegations levelled against them, Mr. Tennakoon said.
He claimed that the Prime Minister had carried out a shrewd plan to rob the Central Bank by appointing Arjuna Mahendran as the CB Governor and the whole exercise culminated in the plunder of public funds. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Candidate asks MS for compensation
	
A candidate contesting for the elections to the Kattankudi Urban Council has claimed compensation from President Maithripala Sirisena for putting up posters on his wall by supporters of the SLFP led by the President.
National Front for Good Governance (NFGG) candidate A.L.M. Sabeel said in a letter to the President that SLFP members had pasted posters on his wall besmearing it and requested that he be paid Rs.7,500 as the cost of colour-washing the wall.
He said he had colour-washed the parapet wall around his house recently and the supporters of the SLFP had pasted posters announcing the President's visit to Kattankudi on January 31.
Reminding that election laws that restricted the pasting of posters, Sabeel said while his party, the NFGG had so far adhered to the law, the President's party had not only violated the law but also caused damages to the properties of residents of the area.
He asked how could the President expect the other parties to adhere to election laws if his party did not follow them and requested the President to pay him compensation during his visit to Kattankudi while pointing out the importance of compensating those who had been similarly affected by posters put up by the President's party.
NFGG is a party that supported President Maithripala Sirisena at the previous presidential election. (A.H.A. Hussain)

He said that Minister Samarasinghe had told that Mr. Rajapaksa could be jailed for seven years.
We challenge the Minister to abolish the civic rights of former president or send him to jail for at-least one day if he could. On that day, the Buddhist monks will take to the streets in the Colombo city, the Thera said.
If Mr. Rajapaksas civic rights are to be abolished, in that case, all those who were involved in the Central Bank Bond Scam should be stoned in the open at the Galle Face Green, he said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Decline  in published data on higher education with the advances in computer technology
	
The University Grants Commission (UGC) as the apex body on university education commenced publishing statistical hand books from the inception to enable the Commission to make evidence based decisions. 
The first handbook was published in 1981 with Prof RA Roy as the Statistical Consultant under the guidance of Dr FSCP Kalpage as the Chairman. It covered data on finance , students , Teaching staff and non-teaching staff. Student data for 5 years pertaining to GCE A level examinations from 1975 to 1979 was included. The data covered the attempt at entry , ethnicity , district etc. They were prepared manually using tally marks in the absence of computers. 
The second hand book (SHB) was published in 1982. FORTRAN IV computer language had been used to analyse the admission data using the computers at the Colombo university. The data covered the academic ability ( entry attempt, marks obtained at the AL examination, category district, merit and under privileged ) and socio demographic and economic background (sex, age, parents occupation, income, ethnicity etc.) of students. 
In mid 1980s the computer information techonology council (CINTEC ) under the direction of Prof V K Samaranayake purchased the SAS package with multiple license to enable several organizations to get the benefit. The CINTEC conducted training programmes too. The UGC made use of this facility which expedited the preparation of admission information of students. 
Subsequently the SPSS software package was utilized for the analysis of data Dr Sarath Amunugama was the chief guest at the inauguration of the International Conference on Statistics for Good Governance held on December 28, 2017 at Hotel Taj. He elaborated on the use of computers with punch cards at the inception and the subsequent advances in computer technology. He further stated that countries in the world can be classified as developing and developed countries whereby the difference is that developing countries do not adequately make use of statistical information.
The availability of published statistical data has declined over the years. The 1997 SHB had 22 tables on student admissions whereas the SHB 2016 had 5 tables. Entry attempt, aggregate marks at the GCE A Level examination, academic performance in university examinations, socio economic and demographic information which was published earlier had not been included. 
The introduction of free education provided an opportunity for students with academic ability from low income families to pursue university education. Hence the entrants socio economic background is necessary to estimate their need for financial support. 
A student has to obtain high grades such as A or B at the GCE A Level examination to study bio science in the Colombo university. Hence the past performance of students entering universities is a necessity to arrive at the minimum qualification for admission to professional courses in either medicine or engineering in private universities. 
Parents income is not taken into consideration in admission to Government schools Thus students who had enjoyed free education with government funds from high income families will be at an advantage to continue their education in private universities. This may cause dissatisfaction among the students from low income families in the same class even though they are equipped with higher grades at the same the GCE A Level examination.

Doubts as to who is ruling the country: Lal Kantha
	
Though both the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the United National Party (UNP) are urging the people to cast their vote for the ruling party, it is doubtful as to which party was ruling the country, National Trade Union Centre (NTUC) Chairman K.D. Lal Kantha said.
He told a public rally in Ginigathhena that the country had a unity government but neither President Maithripala Sirisena nor Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe were able to say that it belonged to any one of them.
Members elected to Local Government bodies should be aware that they will directly receive the funds allocated for development work, he added. (Ranjith Rajapakse)

Economy parlous  John Seneviratne
	
Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister John Seneviratne, in an interview with the Daily Mirror, stresses that the economy of the country is in ruins and the President should intervene to resurrect it.

President should take control of it
	SLFP can never come back to power unless it is united
	Yet, there is little time in Cabinet for us to discuss it
	I tried hard to bring about unity
	Theoretically, SLFP is also collectively responsible for it
	President should translate his words into action after the election
Excerpts:
Q As a senior Minister of the SLFP, how realistic is President Maithripala Sirisenas assertion that he would take over the supervision of the economy
The way the economy is handled is attributed to the parlous economic situation of the country. When you go to the villages, people take up their objections with the Government because the cost of living is very high. Their income is very much restricted. People find living extremely difficult. It has become very bad for them. It shows the economy is not functioning well. For this state of affairs, the public keep on blaming the Government. Maybe, the President has been convinced that the state of affairs should be arrested. He must take over the major control of the economy. He will try to bring order in the economy.
Q Are you in support of that idea
I also feel it. There must be a change or difference now. The state of affairs that existed has not done any good for people.
Q If you want to take over the operation of economic affairs, you will have to take over key Ministries, which are at present with the UNPers. How is it possible
I really do not know what the President meant when he said this. He need not essentially take over the Ministries to take control of the economy. All that he needs to do is to bring all these Ministers under his wing. He needs to avoid decisions being taken in a manner detrimental to the countrys economy.
Q Will these UNP Ministers fall in line with the Presidents way of thinking
Then, of course, the President will be compelled to take alternative action. 
Q Like what
Changing the Cabinet.
Q That again has to be done in consultation with the Prime Minister in accordance with the 19thAmendment
Of course, it has to be done accordingly. I do not think the Prime Minister would stand on the way of rehabilitating the economy, the sick economy of the country, I would say. I am sure the Prime Minister would extend his support if such measures offered better prospects for people.
Q The UNP argues that the SLFP, as the principal party of the Government, should also be held responsible if there is malfunctioning of the economy. What is your view
If you go by the theory of collective responsibility, the SLFP Ministers are also responsible for it, including me. In the Cabinet, these matters are often discussed. Yet, in the Cabinet, we get very limited time to discuss these matters. Real decisions have to be taken by those who contemplate them. They must discuss such measures with experts. Thereafter, the Cabinet paper has to be promulgated and forwarded to the Cabinet. We have very little time to discuss these matters. Although it is said that we are collectively responsible, there are instances we have to oppose.
Q How do you assess the progress of the election campaign
I think SLFP - led alliance and Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) are sharing equally. In the urban areas and the areas where there is a concentration of minorities, the SLFP is scoring heavily. The SLPP is doing better in rural areas. It is extremely difficult to fathom the final outcome. Disgruntled UNPers are also leaving their party these days.
Q The President attacked the UNP right throughout. How will it affect the UNP in your view
Well, the majority of SLFPers who voted us at the last elections do not like this coalition with the UNP. That has been their clamour. When the President attacked the UNP, he showed the distinction between the UNP and the SLFP. Then, people who voted for the SLFP would be happy. 
Q The Joint Opposition said the series of attacks by the President on the UNP is a mere drama staged for a distraction of voters aim at the forthcoming Local Government elections. How do you view it
One cannot blame the President. His role as the SLFP leader falls outside the precincts of the position as the President. He has to ensure the victory of the SLFP above others at a time when the party is divided and the SLPP is harping on him. The President is a seasoned politician, who knows what he does and talks. SLPP Chairman Prof. G.L. Peiris is not very happy with the President for the reason that his expectation to get into Parliament on the National List was not realised.
Q Do you believe whether the President will translate his words into action after the elections
He has to do it. Mere talks will not help him in the long run.
Q Will you be prevailing upon him to translate his words into action
Of course, we will extend whatever cooperation we can, for the implementation of those steps. We will have to help him for the betterment of the country.
Q What do you think of the unity of the party
The SLFP will never come back to the office unless the party is united. That has to be accepted by the leaders of both factions.
I also played an important role in trying to bring these factions together. The senior members of the SLFP and those senior members in the Joint Opposition were of the opinion that we should be united. Unfortunately, the most of the elements, which were opposed to it, were newcomers to Parliament. Also, people with self-interests were against such unity.
Q Will you be trying for that unity after the election again
We have to harness the potential for it.
Q Some SLFP Ministers said that the President should be the next Presidential Candidate of the party. What is your view
Well, I do not know whether the President has decided to contest. He has not yet announced it. If he chooses to contest, then, we will have to back him. If he does not want to contest in keeping with the assurances given by him at the last election, we will have to go for another candidate.
Q Do you have someone in mind
I do not have. I will support whom the party selects.
Q Earlier, in the wake of the bond scam, you sought some information regarding misappropriation of money from the Employees Provident Fund (EPF). Have you received any information from the Central Bank
So far, I did not receive any information. Of course, we have received some information regarding taxes imposed on the EPF. We are having a committee called the Labour Advisory Committee and the representatives of employers and the trade union leaders and the high officials of the Ministry meet and discuss matters pertaining to labour.
At several meetings, the question of EPF money being swindled has been discussed. They are very much concerned about this.

The Government will implement the Enforced Disappearance Bill soon, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday at an election rally in Vavuniya.
The government has already got the Enforced Disappearance Bill approved and is now ready to implement it, he said.

Areas around Trincomalee including Vavuniya will also be developed as a result of the development that will take place in Trincomalee. Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka will be in charge of the development work in Trincomalee. Minister Rishard Bathiudeen will be in charge of the development work in Wanni while Minister D.M. Swaminathan will be in charge of the development work in the North. An industrial zone will also be set up in Mankulum, the Prime Minister said.
Minister Bathiudeen said the government-led by the UNP would do its utmost to develop villages through local bodies. (Yohan Perera, Priyantha Hewage and Sithum Chathuranga)

Gautama Buddha: the incomparable strategist
	
Wisdom acquired through countess eons of indulgence in the ten perfections (parami) endowed the Supremely Enlightened Being with the extraordinary faculty of identifying with absolute precision the mental state of all creatures celestial, human or other at any given time in the past, present or future. 
This prowess, combined with all-pervading compassion for humanity made Him the unique individual He was, with an infallible capacity to adopt the perfect strategy to plod man towards the sorrowless sphere. 
Practice (meditation) generates, and non-practice debilitates wisdom
	He was there referring to the thirty eight objects of meditation
On this score, the case of the scholar monk Pothila stands apart. As a monk in the dispensations of seven Buddhas from Vipassi Buddha downwards, he taught Tripitaka to five hundred monks at any given time. The Blessed One thought, this bhikkhu is of no mind to escape the endless journey of woe. Then he thought whether he must instill some fear in him The plot employed was marvelous. Whenever the monk arrives to pay homage to the Blessed one, he would pronounce, Come here empty Pothila, worship empty Pothila, sit sown empty Pothila, you may now go empty Pothila. When he left Buddha would declares, Empty Pothila is gone. 
The bhikkhu told himself, Here I am, the absolute master of Tripitaka and the commentaries, imparting the profound Teaching to all others, instructing 500 monks at any point of time, yet Buddha continuously addresses me as empty Pothila. May be because I dont possess any Jnana (Wisdom). Much shaken, after taking his class one morning, he headed towards a forest hermitage which was one hundred yojuns (a term used to calculate distance) away taking with him his bowl and robes. All thirty inmates in the hermitage were Arahants. He pleaded with the Sangha Thera to help him. Friend, what are you saying Thoroughly versed in the three chapters, an erudite preacher, we ought to learn a thing or two from you.  Venerable Sir, please do not say so he begged. Having seen through his pride, the Maha Thera directed him to the Deputy Monk who in turn sent him down to the next until he finally ended up with the last of them; a seven year old Samanera Arahant. Pride now shattered, he clasped his hands towards the child monk and appealed that he be rescued. The response he received was the same as that of the Chief Monk. After much persuasion the Samanera agreed, but on condition that he was willing to be obedient to him. The bhikkhu said he would jump into a fire if ordered.
Having seen through his pride, the Maha Thera directed him to the Deputy Monk who in turn sent him down to the next until he finally ended up with the last of them; a seven year old Samanera Arahant
Noting the expensive robe, the samanera told him to get in the pond nearby. Immediately he stepped into it and the moment the robe touched the water he was told to come out. He did as he was told and stood in front of the seven-year-old who used a fine parable. A lizard entered a snakes clay den through one of the six holes in it. A man desirous of getting the lizard closed the other five holes and got hold of it from the sixth through which it entered. So you should shut the five sense doors and keep vigil on the sixth, the mind said the Samanera monk. To the scholar what he heard was the equivalent to a lamp being lit. Noble one, that would do said he and placed his concentration on the thirty two impurities, the sublime practice of the Great Sages. 
In order to assist the eminently wise monk who had come from a hundred yojuns away, the Blessed One said a short stanza. 
Practice (meditation) generates, and non-practice debilitates wisdom. Having understood the above, one places oneself on that path as wide as the earth itself. He was there referring to the thirty eight objects of meditation. The homily suffices for the bhikkhu to attain Arahanthood. 
Bhikku Upasena 
A similar ploy was adopted on none other than Bhikkhu Upasena, younger brother of the first chief disciple Arahant Sariputta. An year after receiving higher ordination, he accepted a novice to be under his wing with the intention of increasing the numbers in the Bhikkhu Order. When he was two years into higher ordination and the novice just one, he decided to visit Gautama Buddha with the intention of pleasing him with his deed. Questioned by the Blessed one, he divulged the respective durations of their monkhoods. When he confessed that the other was his pupil The Enlightened One was forthright in His rebuke of the monks presumptuousness .
An empty man, steeped in naivety pretending to be great he had said. Thus shamed, he vowed to some day elicit exultations from the same face with a moon-like glow on account of the very numbers he would bring under the fold. That very day he sat down in insight meditation in earnest, attaining Arahanthood in no time. Many were young men eager to become his pupils considering his noble family lineage and the ability to preach Dhamma that made the earth tremble. The great Arahant then informed the would be novices that he is a strict hermitage dweller so only those willing to dwell on the harsh ascetic practices could join him. He was himself a devout follower of all thirteen of the sacred rules of asceticism. 
Ten years on, with a congregation of five hundred pupils, each an ascetic and a recipient of higher ordination, he went to pay homage to Gautama Buddha at Savaththi. To raise a dialogue Gautama Buddha asked one of the young monks whether he fancied his garb, a robe presented as an offering during pansakula ( A ritual performed at a funeral during which monks are present). The monk replied that he did not, but with deference to his teacher he was wearing it. Buddha exclaimed,  Sadhu, sadhu Upasena and heaped praise upon the Arahant. On a later day He pronounced that Bhikkha Upasena was foremost among the disciples for being able to repose others faith in the Discipline. The monk was presented with the title Samantha Pasadika. 
Bhikku Upali
The Sutta Pitaka resonates endlessly with the vibrant majesty of Gautama Buddhas fertile mind that at times makes use of the subtlest of guises to assist the disciple to reach the supreme goal. Once Arahant Upali apprised the Blessed One that he wished to take up residence in a jungle monastery. Gautama Buddha merely drew a simile. An elephant entered a large pond, drank water and made the water splash. A hare wanting to follow suit jumped into the pond. It either drowned or floated in the water. So Upali, said Buddha You remain here with me, partake of alms offered by the faithful and accept robes given by them. Later he was to be bearer of the immense code of discipline for monks; the Vinaya. He later declared that this was his abode. It was his samsaric wish. 
The depth of a Buddhas wisdom is unimaginable. The unique ability to fathom anothers psyche (indriyaparopariyaththa gnana) rests solely with him. Once, seven hundred Bhikkhus having received meditation topics returned to inform Gautama Buddha of their final liberation from worldly shackles, whereas in reality their defilement had only been suppressed by achievement of gnanas (absorption). Gautama Buddha informed Ven. Ananda Thero that there was no purpose in their meeting him and instead instructed Ananda Thero to direct them to the charnel ground. Dejected they were with the revulsive sight of two to three day old corpses and attracted by the ones just brought in. Projecting an image of Himself before them He pronounced Monks, it is improper. Seeing a body of skin, bone and sinew, it is improper of you to develop lustful thoughts. All seven hundred of them attained Arahanthood and venerated the Blessed One at Jetawanarama. 
Kisagothami
Scholastic achievements and academic excellence are not the criteria that govern ones capacity to comprehend Buddhas radical insights into human nature. Numberless were those who tilled the fields, herded cattle and tended the kitchen fires that grasped the deep philosophy the instant it fell in the ear. The plots Gautama Buddha employed for the purpose were unique as in the case of Kisagothami. She was running from house to house deranged in mind, seeking medicine to revive her dead child straddled on her hip, when a kind man directed her to Jetawanaramaya where Gautama Buddha was seated on the pulpit ready to begin a sermon. She did as was told and sought medicine from the Blessed One. 
Observing the latent merit in her, He said, Gothami, you have come to the right place. Go into the city and bring some mustard from a house where no one has died. She left, but did not go far, threw the corpse into a cemetery and went back to where Buddha was. Gothami, did you get the mustard Lord, the work with mustard is over. Please do help me. She was the Arahant Bhikkuni known for the most coarse of robes worn by anyone in the Bhikkhuni order, again in accordance with a prayer made before Piyamathura Buddha a hundred thousand kalpas before.

Nanda, a Sakyan princess, hopelessly infatuated with her own beauty avoided seeing Buddha because He always spoke disparagingly of superficial appearance. One day however she could not avoid visiting Him with a crowd, but hid herself from Gautama Buddhas view. Having created a life like image of a celestial nymph fanning him from behind and visible only to her, The Enlightened One made the heavenly one gradually grow old, decay, wallow in her own filth and perish. Transfixed by the horrible sight, it did not take long for her to realize the stark nature of things, where upon Gautama Buddha uttered a verse which transmitted her to that state of irreversible iridescence. 
Gautama Buddhas wisdom in all its colorful glory makes the canon the most readable material in the world.

Merkel secures coalition breakthrough on refugee family reunions
	

DPA, 30th JANUARY, 2018- German Chancellor Angela Merkels conservative bloc and the Social Democrats (SPD) came to an agreement on refugee family reunions on Tuesday, overcoming a key hurdle on the way to forming a coalition government.
Family reunions for refugees wishing to bring relatives to Germany will be suspended until July 31, after which the number is to be capped at 1,000 people per month, sources from the parties negotiating teams told dpa.
The cap will be subject to some exceptions in cases of extreme hardship, they said.
Merkels Christian Democrats (CDU), their Bavarian CSU sister party and the SPD already agreed to the monthly limit on family reunions in a draft coalition deal earlier this month.
But the debate was reopened following the launch of formal coalition talks, some four months after an inconclusive election in September.
The parties have yet to explain whether family reunions will be available to people who have been granted partial protection as asylum seekers. The exact details are to be hashed out during talks in the coming weeks.

Money talks loud as usual
	

Electioneering requires money and the candidates liberally spend to buy votes despite taboos imposed by election laws.

The main political parties have already begun distributing money among their candidates to meet their electioneering expenses. A certain main political party is reportedly distributing Rs.50,000 to each candidate in the fray and Rs.25,000 to each on the national list.
A wealthy woman purohita at state level has come forward to offer Rs.50,000 to each female candidate contesting from the party. A high political authority of the previous regime hailing from the South has given the undertaking to meet the financial needs of his party candidates. Meanwhile, the leader of a political party in the ruling coalition has begun handing Rs.7 to 8 lakhs to each candidate in the fray from his party.
Most gem city merchants have generously contributed to the election fund started by a powerful politician, they say.
The expenditure burden on the political parties at these local polls has lessened to a great extent thanks to the absence of the competition for manape. However, the increase in the number of candidates twice over at these polls has largely set off that advantage, they say.

The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) today said there was an attempt to arrest MP Ravi Karunanayake prior to the parliamentary debate on the Bond Commission report and then release him after the Local Government (LG) elections were over.
Former provincial councillor Ajith Prasanna claimed at a news conference that the MPs consent had been obtained to arrest him.
Both the President and the Prime Minister are playing to the gallery by calling for a debate on the Bond report prior to the elections. We have received information that Mr. Karunanayake has been persuaded to be arrested to save the party and the unity government. During the debate, the government leaders will score points by saying that this is good governance and that they have even arrested a former minister. However, once the election is over, he will be released, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Navam Perahera A pageant that commemorates Buddhas first sermon
	
Majestic Procession conducted to commemorate the Dhamma Chakka Pavattana Sutta
Navam Perahera which was originally known as Colamba Perahera is conducted annually during Navam (February) at Hunupitiya Gangaramaya Viharaya. The arrangements for the pageant are made by Gangaramaya Temple. The organizing is handled by young people associated with the temple under the direction of the chief incumbent of the temple, Ven. Galaboda Gnanissara Thera. 
Originally Kolamba Perahera was conducted in August, immediately after the Esala Perahera in Kandy. The thought behind conducting the Navam Perahera is to commemorate the first sermon of Gautama Buddha titled Dhamma Chakka Pavattana Sutta and held at Isipathanaramaya. 
Gangaramaya Raja Maha Viharaya 
Gangaramaya was originally a small hermitage in a piece of marshy land at Hunupitiya within the Municipal Limits of Colombo. It was transformed into a nationally and internationally known Viharaya by Ven. Dewananda Sri Jinaratana Nayake Thera. Jinaratana Nayake Thera was liked and honoured by Buddhists as well as by non- Buddhists. With the cooperation of the people in the area the Thera transformed the little Avasaya (monks quarters) into a large temple complex within a short period of time. At present Gangaramaya carries three main features: Sharairika Dhatu (physical remains of the Buddha), Maha Bodhi (the sacred tree) and Buddha Rupa (Buddha Images.) The main features of the temple include Viharaya (main temple) the Chetiya (Pagoda), Bo tree, Vihara Mandiraya, Seemamalikaya and the relic chamber. In addition a museum, a library, a residential hall, a three- storey pirivena, an educational hall and an alms hall are also in the premises. 
The origin of the pageant 
In place of the former Kolamba Perahera an annual pageant is conducted. This practice began in 1979 with state patronage. The Prime Minister of the country back then was R. Premadasa. The objectives of this pageant are varied. Primarily it is to venerate the Triple Gem, Buddha, His doctrine the Dharma and Buddhas disciples Sangha. Another objective is to commemorate the appointment of Arahants (Enlightened ones) Sariputta and Moggallana by Gautama Buddha as his chief disciples (Agra Sravaka). The two most important positions in the Order of Maha Sangha were conferred on Arahant Sariputta (Dakunath Suw) and Arahant Moggallana (Wamath Suw) by the Enlightened One at the first congregation on Navam Full Moon Poya Day after experiencing Enlightenment. 
The pageant also makes provision to sustain traditional dancing and other art forms as well as Sinhala culture. It also encourages talented artistes to hone their skills and be known. Thus this pageant emerged during a time when no Buddhist pageant was conducted within the metropolitan area of Colombo. The pageant comprises a multitude of participants who in unison make it magnificent. 
Performers 
Various types of performers make the pageant colourful. In addition to the electric lamps on the streets there are torch bearers who provide not only light, but also colour to the pageant. Copra or dried kernel of coconut is put into flambeaus and lit so that flames emerge and illuminate the surroundings. 
Whip crackers 
Whip crackers serve a number of purposes. Firstly it is a means of clearing the way for the main pageant. Spectators confine themselves to the pavement and leave the road entirely for the procession to pass without any disruption. Secondly it is a signal that the main procession is approaching. It is also helps signify the majesty of the procession. It is also a sound offering. It is said that even the celestial beings hear that sound which is an invitation to watch the procession. Devotees young and old and also
schoolchildren walk behind the whip crackers; some of them carrying flags, banners and trays of flowers.

Elephants 
Beautifully adorned elephants including tuskers provide majesty and elegance to the procession. The tusker of the temple carries the relic casket on its back. Like in the Sri Dalada Perahera in Kandy, Kelaniya Duruthu Perahera and Bellanwila Raja Maha Viharaya Perahera the elephants walk in Gangaramaya Navam Perahera too. They are adorned in costumes consisting of three parts -the body part, the fore head garland called Neththi Malaya and the ear ornament called Kan joduwa. Large quantities of padding, rich cloth, velvet coral etc. are required to make these costumes. Obviously these ornaments add to the elegance of the elephants which in turn provide colour to the procession. 
Performers of drama 
Drama performers at the Gangaramaya Navam Perahera can be categorized into four groups. There are the dancing teams representing the dancing styles of Kandy, low country and Sabaragamuwa. 
Drummers
The worlds oldest and most ubiquitous musical instrument, the drum, is used in all these dances. Various kinds of drums such as Gatabera, Mangul Bera,Yak Bera, Udakkki, Pantheru and Rabana are used during these dances. In addition a pair of cymbals-Talampota-also known as Taitalama (the Tamil cymbal) is used with the tambourine to provide timing. Tambourines are beaten to produce rich and melodious sounds so that the music is in harmony with the dancing. The songs are known as Vannams. The Talampota is used in all dances to maintain the rhythm. A loud ringing sound is made when the two cymbals clash. 
Hewisi drummers 
The most important group comprises the Hewisi drummers. They produce a roar using the large drum which is termed Daula. Another drum used by this group is the double drum titled thammattama. Another key instrument used by this group is the bugle horn horanewa. Meanwhile the conch shell blowers produce gentle and prolonged sounds increasing the serenity of the atmosphere. 
Vannam or metrical verses 
Dancers in their costumes look elegant when they move in the procession. They sing Vannams while dancing. Vannams are metrical verses sung by dancers to provide lyrical music through their performances. There are eighteen Vannams such as Thuranga (horse) Vannama, Vairody (cats eye gem) Vannama, Savula (cock) Vannama and the most important Gajaga (elephant) Vannama. When the performers dance to the tune of Gajaga Vannama they move just like elephants. 
Ves Natuma 
A special kind of Kandyan dancing is known as Ves Natuma. Dancers belonging to this category have to undergo training for a long period of time before they are considered as fully fledged Ves dancers. The performer will be entitled to the Ves costume which is accompanied with a beautiful head dress only after the completion of the training. 
Pantheru dancers 
Pantheru dancers form another group. Each dancer has a circular instrument called the pantheru which produces a clinging sound. This makes the performance melodious. 
Stilt walkers 
Borukakul karayas or stilt walkers produce special colour to the pageant. The performers walk high above the ground on two long poles with pads to rest their feet on. They sneer at the spectators from above and provide them with entertainment. 
The organization 
A significant feature about this pageant is that it is planned and organized in an excellent manner. The pageant parades a number of streets and the main road in front of Gangaramaya Viharaya and along the Beira Lake -Navam Mawatha. Seating accommodation is provided for spectators. The route of the pageant is predetermined and the places where elephants, dancers, drummers and torch bearers, Maha Sangha, office bearers and others who partake in the pageant and well planned. The organisers leave no stone unturned when preparing for the event.

Pentagon bans disclosure of data on Taliban in Afghan war: Watchdog
	

(Hindustan Times/AFP), Washington, 30 jan 2018 - -A US government watchdog said Tuesday the Pentagon has barred it from disclosing how much of Afghanistan is under Taliban control -- a significant break from past accountability that comes amid mounting security woes in the war-torn nation.
At issue are the number of Afghan districts, and the populations living in them, considered to be held or influenced by the Kabul government by insurgents or contested by both.
The US government has sometimes referred to such numbers in the 16-year-old war to show how the Afghan security forces are faring against a resurgent Taliban.
But in a report published Tuesday, the US governments office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) said the Pentagon had instructed it to no longer disclose the numbers.
SIGAR said the Pentagon had also asked its office, for the first time since 2009, to classify the figures detailing the size and attrition rates of Afghan
security forces.

Putin says US list targets all Russians
	

REUTERS, 30th JANUARY, 2018- President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday the release of a U.S. list of Russian businessmen close to the Kremlin was an unfriendly act, but Moscow did not currently plan to retaliate.
The U.S. Treasury Department named major Russian businessmen in a so-called oligarchs list which was released earlier on Tuesday.
The list, drawn up as part of a sanctions package signed into law in August last year, does not mean those included will be subject to sanctions, but it casts a potential shadow of sanctions risk over a wide circle of wealthy Russians. It is, of course, an unfriendly act. It will complicate the difficult situation Russian-American relations are already in, and of course harm international relations as a whole, Putin said.
Speaking at meeting with election campaign officials in Moscow, Putin said it was stupid to treat Russian in the same way as North Korea and Iran, while also asking Moscow to help broker a peace deal on the Korean peninsula.
But the Russian leader said he still wanted to improve ties with the United States and would refrain from any immediate retaliation.
We were waiting for this list, and I will not hide it, were ready to take retaliatory steps, serious ones, which would have reduced our relations to zero, Putin said.
