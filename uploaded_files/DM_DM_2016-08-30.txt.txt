A big question mark over his benevolence
	
Unusual generosity on the part of a leading businessman has raised eye brows in political circles, they say.
This businessman has already paid a lump sum of Rs.9 million as six months payment for a house taken on rent by a leading politician.
The politician had moved into the rented house because his official residence is now under repairs.
Incidentally, this generous businessman is a son- in- law of a onetime white-collar bigwig who controlled public finance, they say.

England breaks SLs record for highest score in ODI
	
England smashed a world record-breaking 444-3 against Pakistan in their third one-day international on Tuesday, after opening batsman Alex Hales hit Englands highest individual ODI score with 171.
That surpassed the previous record of 443 for nine by Sri Lanka against the Netherlands at Amstelveen in 2006.
It was also the highest ODI total in a match between two Test nations, topping South Africas 439 for two against the West Indies at Johannesburg last year.
Alex Hales, on his Nottinghamshire home ground, made an England ODI record 171 on Tuesday.
Hales struck 22 fours and four sixes in a 122-ball blitz at his home ground in Trent Bridge, beating Robin Smiths 23-year-old England record of an unbeaten 167 against Australia.
Jos Buttler (90 not out) also punished Pakistans bowlers by notching Englands fastest ever ODI half century in just 22 balls. Captain Eoin Morgan, who won the toss and opted to bat, profited from a dropped catch to remain unbeaten on 57.
Together with Joe Root (85), who hit his third successive half century of the series, Hales added 248 runs off 190 balls as England bettered the previous world record of 443-9, set by Sri Lanka against the Netherlands in 2006, when Buttler hit a four off the last ball.

Govt. to discuss Peace-Building-Fund with UNSG
	
The Government will discuss the setting up of a Multi-Million Dollar Peace Building Fund (PBF) for Sri Lanka, sponsored by the UN, during the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moons three-day visit to Sri Lanka, a senior Foreign Affairs Ministry source said yesterday.
Deputy Foreign Minister Harsha De Silva told Daily Mirror that the objective of the PBF was to ensure fast and flexible funding in support of various peace-building and reconciliation efforts in Sri Lanka
This is the clear manifestation of the success of peace-building and reconciliation programme of the unity government and the acceptance by the global community that Sri Lanka is on the right track. If and when the UN approves and supports the government, it is a positive reflection that not only the international community but all global agencies under the UN and global financial institutions like the World Bank, IMF and the Asian development Bank are behind Sri Lanka, ready to help, Dr. De Silva said.

He said the visit of the UN chief would boost the Governments endeavour to meet Sustainable Development Goals.
The deputy minister said the attitudinal change among the world body, other global agencies and the international community from a hostile an invasive stance to an extremely friendly and cooperative one was a great achievement for Sri Lanka against the backdrop of a successful reconciliation and peace building programme.
In that case, Sri Lanka is unique and a success story in a post conflict situation in any part of the world. That is why Mr. Ban has chosen Sri Lanka to pay an official visit at the tail end of his tenure in the UN, he said.
Mr. Ban-ki Moon is scheduled to arrive in Sri Lanka on Friday. He will be accompanied by his wife and a 20-member entourage.
He is scheduled to hold talks with President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera.
Mr. Ban will also meet Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan and Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

MR too old at 70 to form new party: Rajitha
	
Taking a swipe at moves by the joint opposition to from a new party headed by ex-president Mahinda Rajapaksa, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said yesterday such attempts were not conducive for a person who was 70 years of age.
At a ceremony held to welcome the new SLFP organizer for Beruwala, M.M.M.Amjad, the minister said actor turned politician Vijaya Kumaratunga formed the Mahajana Paksaya at the peak of his popularity and at a relatively young age. Therefore, he had a huge backing from voters young and old.
Mr. Rajapaksas attempt to form a new party at this old age with a group of old and bankrupt fellow travellers is a big joke. They will be exposed at the forthcoming local government polls. It a pity that they had failed to realize that they are at the tail end of their political life and a large number of joint opposition members will not be seen in the next Parliament, the minister said.
"The modus operandi of the Rajapaksa gang in 2014 was to win elections by spreading racism and ethnic disharmony. This conspiracy was hatched by Gotabaya. He even sent a group to Beruwala to defeat me at the polls. Certain Muslim businessmen worked in cahoots with them. But a big majority of Muslims in Beruwala led by Amjad supported me and ensured my victory. That is why I recommended him to the President to be appointed as SLFP organizer in Beruwala," he added.
The minister said Mahinda and Gotabaya must be ashamed of being the sons of D.A. Rajapaksa because Rajapaksa senior was a great politician who never resorted to crime, racial hatred and anti-national activities and would wriggle in shame if he knew what his sons were doing today.
He said the SLFP recognised the five powerful forces in Sri Lanka -- Sangha, Veda, Guru, Govi, Kamkaru under the concepts of justice, fair play, democracy and non alignment but the SLFP was turned into a house of rogues by Mahinda Rajapaksa's brothers and sons.
"It had now became a haven for money launderers, rapists, thugs, rogue businessmen and tavern owners. There is no doubt that if this gang forms a new party, it will be funded by all these criminals and racketeers, the minister said.
He said in Sri Lankas history politicians in the calibre of Maithripala Senanayaka, Anura Bandaranaike, Chandrika and Vijaya, Lalith Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayaka tried to form new political parties after defecting either from the UNP or the SLFP but no one succeeded though both parties remain intact and strong as ever.
The minister said he was going through a transitional period or in a Gandabba position (a position between death and rebirth) and added his main task at this time was to strengthen the unity between President Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe through a bridge of unity and understanding and the task has been extremely successful.

Pan Asia Bank progresses gaining rapid growth
	
Pan Asia Bank which is known for its range of novel innovative products and services is in the process of introducing new online and mobile banking channels.
This initiative was taken in response to the changing customer lifestyles and with a view of adding significant value to customer experience by way of cost saving and improving productivity, a top official of the bank told the Sunday Times.
Pan Asia Bank Director/CEO Dimantha Seneviratne in an interview with Mirror Business disclosed that the bank is specifically focusing on three areas namely People, Product and Process in order to generate and maintain a superior and robust performance. He further stated that the Bank is set to introduce new cutting-edge online banking system next month followed by a mobile banking solution soon.
Seneviratne noted that as a result of this approach the bank has gained a significant growth in its balance sheet as well as profits while reducing operational costs. Elaborating on this he added that the banks customer deposit base has been increased up to Rs. 90 billion while its pre-tax profit has increased to Rs. 943 million and post tax profit to Rs.603 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from Rs.456 million and Rs. 349 million respectively during the same period last year. Further, the bank has almost doubled the balance sheet growth to Rs. 121.5 billion up to June this year from Rs.65 billion in 2014. He attributed this phenomenal growth to the right strategies and efficiency and dedication of the entire staff.
Consistency in service quality improvement
The bank which strongly believes that the best way to sustain this growth is to consistently improve its service quality, has taken several important measures to strengthen that aspect by providing intensive training to all staff members of the bank. In addition, over 160 staff members have been trained to provide ongoing training to fellow staff members with a view to uphold consistent high service standards. This initiative has helped the bank immensely to offer a new level of excellent customer care to customers and support customer retention.
According to Seneviratne another area where the bank focused on was to increase the efficiency with a view to bring down the costs. This strategy has proved to be effective as evident by the improvement in the banks cost to income ratio which stood at 55 percent by 30th June this year. During this time the bank also managed to improve its net non performing loans (NPL) down to 2.7 percent from 4.39 percent in 2014.
These financial results are a strong indication of the banks capacity to deliver consistent performance irrespective of the economic turbulences, he pointed out. We have throughout been proactive in identifying the market developments before competitors which enabled us to make early entry in to certain segments and this has been a major reason for our successful performance.
Referring to the banks enviable product portfolio, Seneviratne noted that the bank has been well positioned in introducing innovative and novel products based on
Blue Ocean Strategy to cater to customer needs.
Elaborating on an example on the banks product development strategy, he stated that in an era where retirees were largely being neglected by the society and overlooked by the financial sector, Pan Asia Bank stepped in to offer Sammana loan scheme as an innovative financial product for government pensioners with the aim of contributing positively towards the countrys economic development.
This loan scheme offers loan facilities up to Rs. 1.5 million with repayment periods of up to seven years for government pensioners as well as for retired Central Bank employees without any collateral. Customers who obtain this loan will also get a special life insurance policy.This insurance policy ensures that in an event of a customers untimely demise before the loan is paid off, his/her family is not burdened with the liability of the remainder of the loan he revealed.
Another special loan scheme, Ranaviru Harasara is now being implemented for the benefit of the members of the Sri Lanka Army, Navy and Air Force, including disables soldiers, those who are serving and the family members of those who were killed in action. Originally launched as a deposit scheme it has now been extended as a loan scheme to enable the members to utilize the funds for a range of purposes including self employment, purchasing land or vehicles, building houses, wedding expenses, higher education, childrens education etc.
Another example of the banks innovative product range is its Daskam
Childrens Savings Account. Not limiting itself to the standard practice of offering gifts for childrens saving deposits, the bank offers Daskam Childrens Savings accounts which offers an additional 10% deposit by the bank for each and every customer deposit made to the account till the account holder completes 12 years of age. This particular product was specifically designed to ensure that there is a way to build a sizable saving for children especially for their higher education purposes when they turn 18.
Overall performance
In recognition of its superior overall performance, Pan Asia Bank has received the award for Fastest Growing Commercial Bank in Sri Lanka from the London based Global Banking and Finance Review in three consecutive years since 2014, he revealed. Global Banking and Finance Review annually recognizes outstanding achievements in the financial services industry and in its review and selection process, it considers factors such as the institutions strategic focus, achievements and progressive and inspirational changes taken place within the company, he disclosed.
Commenting on the banks future plans he stated that Pan Asia Bank expects to take banking into rural areas introducing mobile banking and micro financing in a big way. He further added that they will continue to remain futuristic and make forward looking decisions to capitalize on new opportunities.

SLTB case: Susil Premajayantha and Anura Priyadarshana Yapa released
	
The Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) today moved the Colombo Commercial High Court to release the two respondents Susil Premajayantha and Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, (members of the 2015 - UPFA presidential election committee) from the case filed against them for the recovery of Rs 143 million due to the SLTB for hiring buses for the meetings of presidential candidate Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The Counsel for the plaintiff, while moving to release the two respondents from the case, further amended the plaint against five respondents, including former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and chief of staff of the former president Gamini Senarath, for the recovery of Rs 143 million.
Commercial High Court Judge Shiran Gunaratne had earlier, on a request made by the Counsel for the SLTB, allowed him to amend the plaint since the plaintiff wanted to amend several names of defendants cited in the plaint.
Commercial High Court Judge Shiran Gunaratne ordered the respondents to file objections on November 22.
The SLTB had earlier named seven UPFA 2015- presidential election committee members, including former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, the former UPFA general secretary Susil Premajayantha, former SLFP general secretary Anura Priyadarshana Yapa and election committee member Gamini Senarath, as respondents for the petition.

VIP guest given the cold shoulder
	

A leading purohita from the West who was among those hosted to lunch by a colleague from the South at his residence recently had been denied a facility to re-charge his mobile phone.

All Blue and Green politicians who attended the recent public rally held in Matara to celebrate the first anniversary of the yahapalanaya government had been hosted to lunch by the purohita from the South.
The purohita from the West who had arrived at the residence of the Southern colleague ahead of others had moved round the house looking for a plug-point to recharge his mobile phone, but none of the inmates had come forward to help him. Finally, he had to use the cell-charging facility in his vehicle, they say.
