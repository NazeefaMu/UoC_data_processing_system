Backdoor bid misfired!
	
?
A political chief overseeing a distant province had phoned up the Number One in yahapalanaya.
?
The purpose of his call was to seek the Lokka?s pull to bail out the father of a team colleague in hot water.
The chief explained to the Big Boss that the father of his team colleague hailing from a high-class family in the plantation domain had been made to suffer a stay in the Welikada State lodge after getting involved in a case and appealed to him to deliver him from the fate awaiting him.
This appeal made on behalf of a dude awaiting justice at the Welikada lodge sent Number One into a fury. ?I say,? he had shouted into the phone.
?Don?t try to rub every bit of muck in this country on my body. I have got enough problems to worry about?You had better mind your own business!?
The Number One had hung up just as the provincial chief had begun making his meek apology, they say.

Bodhisatta in Katchateevu Island;  Asceticism Defined
	
?
The origin of this episode is traceable to a sermon delivered by Lord Buddha to a benefactor of His in the midst of a large gathering of devotees whilst residing at Jetawanaramaya.? ?
The benefactor offered a ?maha dana? to the community of bhikkhus headed by Lord Buddha for seven days ending with the presentation of all necessary requisites (pirikara) to the monks.? ?
Buddha pronounced, ?Upasaka, your donation indeed was enormous. Charity, the legend of the ancient sages is to be practised both by layman and cleric alike. The wise forest-dwelling hermits of the past offered their solitary meal of unsalted, untempered water-sprinkled kara leaves to whoever who came in search of food and basked in the happiness of their charity.?? ?
The benefactor exclaimed ?Lord, my offering of alms and requisites to bhikkhus was manifest to everyone here, but Your pronouncement was not. Please do explain it to us.?? The Blessed one then delivered His sermon during the reign of king Brahmadatta in the long past. He was born into a Brahmin family of enormous wealth and was named Akiththi. His sister was Yasawathi. About the time the Bodhisatta concluded his studies at Taxila, their parents passed away. He thought to himself, no dead man ever took his wealth along with him but I will, and called upon his sister to take over the vast fortune of their parents.? ?
?
From the day the two of them ordained themselves and started living in a temple on a beautiful location, citizens of the kingdom in their thousands followed suit and much veneration by the masses ensued similar to that of a Buddha, as stated in the Atuwa
?
When she questioned him what works in his mind he confessed to her of his decision to relinquish lay life. She replied ?Child, I am not willing to go down on my knees and receive what you spat out. I will follow your footstep.? Akiththi Bodhisatta opened the doors of his mansion for people to remove all the treasures within, but seeing no end to it he left the city of Benares accompanied by his sister amidst weeping relatives. The gateway they used to exit the city came to be called Akiththi portal and the port they crossed the river from, Akiththi port.? ?
From the day the two of them ordained themselves and started living in a temple on a beautiful location, citizens of the kingdom in their thousands followed suit and much veneration by the masses ensued similar to that of a Buddha, as stated in the Atuwa. To the Bodhisatta the newly gained fame turned out to be of great hindrance. In want of solitude, he left without informing even his sister and arrived at a garden close to Kaveera Strait of the Tamil land where he developed the six powers of supernormal knowledge (abinna)? ?
Again, the popularity he gained knew no bounds and it became a bane to him. With total discontentment, he travelled through the air and descended on Kara island, the present Katchateevu near Nagadeepa. The island of Kara was then known as Abhideepa. The Bodhisatta?s sister going in search of her brother arrived on the Tamil land, but unable to find him continued to live where her brother did. She failed to develop any of the higher powers.? ?
Living under a Kara tree on the island, Akiththi Bodhisatta survived entirely on the fruits and leaves found on the ground. Sakka the king of gods becoming aware of his severe austerity wondered whether the ascetic aspired to become Sakkha himself or something else and came up to him in the guise of a Brahmin beggar. ?If it is the kingship of the heavens he means he will offer the water-sprinkled Kara leaves to me, if otherwise he will not? he thought. Overjoyed at his sight, the Bodhisatta emptied all the leaves in his bowl into that of the Brahmin, and made that rarest of wish that his offering culminates in reaching Supreme Enlightenment in the world some day. Sakka having accepted the leaves went away.? ?
Bodhisatta spent the rest of the day on an empty stomach immersed in the happiness of his gift. The Brahmin beggar appeared on the second and third days as well where he received the same offering. Now weak in body yet ecstatic that he has gained much merit out of Kara leaves, Bodhisatta waited near the doorway to his dwelling contemplating on his dana. Sakka too wondered, this Brahmin gives with a happy heart though hungry and weak, without an iota of change in him, must inquire what his intentions are. Past noon time the king of gods appeared in front of Bodhisatta in all his resplendent glory glistening like the youthful sun.? ?
?
Kashyapa, on account of those words of wisdom, I shall grant you a wish, do let me know it
?
?Hermit, what makes you practise this harsh asceticism in the hot wind blowing over the brackish water surrounding you? Is it the splendour of the human or the heavenly worlds or yet another??? ?
?Sakka, sorrowful is rebirth and disintegration of body at every turn. So is confrontation of death in bedeviled mind. Therefore I practise asceticism in the hope of Nirvana where no such sorrow exists? replied Bodhisatta.? ?
Weary of all life this man lives in the forest in expectation of Nirvana, Sakka was happy and decided to reward him. ?Kashyapaya, on account of those words of wisdom, I shall grant you a wish, do mention it?.? ?
?Lord of all beings, Sakka, men are never sated with all their possessions of sons, wives, wealth and other treasures. Let such avarice not dwell on me.?? ?
?Kashyapa, on account of those words of wisdom and reason, I shall grant you a wish. Do mention it.?? ?
?People come to ruin because of land, treasures, cattle, horses, slaves and workers, Sakka, Lord of all beings, let that evil not arise in me.?? ?
?Kassapa, on account of those words of wisdom well uttered, I shall grant you a wish, do mention it.?? ?
?Lord of all beings, if you grant me a wish let me never come across a lowly one, let me not hear of him, associate with him, speak with him nor ever develop a liking to him.?? ?
?
Buddha pronounced, ?Upasaka, your donation indeed was enormous. Charity, the legend of the ancient sages is to be practised both by layman and cleric alike. The wise forest-dwelling hermits of the past offered their solitary meal of unsalted, untempered water-sprinkled kara leaves to whoever who came in search of food and basked in the happiness of their charity.???
?
?Kashyapa tell me, what has he done to you, why do you so dislike him? Has he killed your mother or father??? ?
?The lowly one directs you towards depravity, deploys you in the inappropriate, is angered by well- considered advice and reason, is intemperate.?? ?
?Kasyapa, on account of those words of wisdom I shall grant you a wish. Do mention it?? ?
?Lord of all beings, it you grant me a wish let me meet a wise man, let me always hear of him, associate with him, converse with him and continue to appreciate his acquaintance.?? ?
?He directs you towards righteousness, is guided by righteousness, never deploys you in the inappropriate, is never angered by well considered advice and is temperate. Association with him is rewarding.?? ?
?Kasyapa, on account of those words of wisdom I shall grant you a wish. Do mention it?? ?
?Lord of all beings, if there are pious beings worthy of food for the gods, let such food materialize in plenty in the world with dawn of the morning sun. May I never exhaust alms that I give, nor ever be repentant over it, but always be joyful.?? ?
?Kashyapa, on account of those words of wisdom, I shall grant you a wish, do let me know it.?? ?
?Sakka, lord of all beings, if you grant me my wish, never do appear before me again. That is the wish I ask of you.?
?Many are the rituals performed by men and women in this world to have a fleeting glimpse of me. What is it that you fear of me??
?When I see the euphoric gaiety of your heavenly splendour I may lapse in the pursuit of my ascetic aspirations. That is my fear of seeing you? replied Bodhisatta.
The king of gods said ?Venerable Sir, I seek your forgiveness. Never will I visit you again.? He worshipped Bodhisatta and disappeared.?
In concluding Ariththi Jathaka the Blessed one exclaimed the hermit of Katchateeva island then was He Himself and Sakka the god king was venerable Anuruddha Thero in that particular birth.? ?

Cabinet approves laws to set up Truth Commission
	
The Cabinet is reported to have approved the draft legislation to set up the National Truth Commission as an initiative to ensure the transitional justice envisaged in resolution 30/1 on Sri Lanka adopted by the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC).
The UNHRC resolution co-sponsored by Sri Lanka says, ?The commitment of the Government of Sri Lanka to strengthen and safeguard the credibility of the processes of truth-seeking, justice, reparations and guarantees of non-recurrence by engaging in broad national consultations with the inclusion of victims and civil society, including non-governmental organizations, from all affected communities, which will inform the design and implementation of these processes, drawing on international expertise, assistance and best practices?.
Meanwhile, the government had set up the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) under a parliamentary Act to check the fate of those who went missing during the armed conflict and also enacted legislation recently to set up the Office for Reparation as part of the same process of ensuring transitional justice.
The government will now be left with the task of setting up a judicial mechanism as a part of this process.
The UNHRC has given time till March 2019 to implement the provisions in resolution 30/1. Sri Lanka?s case will be reviewed during the UNHRC sessions in March next year. (Kelum Bandara)

Clutching at another straw?
	
?
The latest person to have come forward to bail out Khaki Chief in hot water is said to be a Buddhist monk residing in a temple in a city suburb, they say.
?
The monk is said to be a close associate of several political bigwigs in yahapalanaya.
The monk and the Khaki Chief are known to be long-standing pals.
The Khaki Chief had as a last resort had poured out his stricken heart to the monk the other day.
The monk had immediately consoled him saying: ?Don?t worry.? I?ll look after you!?
This monk is said to have given a similar assurance to a former top team member as well when he was facing the threat of losing his portfolio and that assurance had miserably failed.? Some people wonder whether the assurance he had given to the Khaki Chief too would come to nothing the same way!??

CONTRADICTIONS!!!
	
?
This column has carried all of the contradictions that are being carried today, but with a purpose!!! For the past three years, we hardly heard of our President making strides in the international arenas while remaining completely oblivious to what was happening at home!!! Both the President and the Prime Minister concur that they are concerned about the economic problem but, not to the extent that they cease their jaunts out of the country!!! Ranil is touring the world and it looks like a now or never before it is too late; he has hardly come back from one country when he is off to another!!! Our Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray had said: ?Deterioration of Parliamentary standards reflects overall political chaos.? Well said Sir, thanks to our erstwhile politicians there is total chaos in the country!!!
Both the President and Premier are of the opinion that restricting imports of vehicles and foodstuff will be a solution to the economic crisis, but apparently, they have no moral right to do so. They have both imported vehicles worth Rs. 600 million, as Head of State and Prime Minister they can, but what you and I don?t know is the duty component here that contributes to the Rs. 600 million!!! Additionally, they had better let the people know that there are no free helicopter rides to Parliament, as alleged in somepapers!!! Also, stopping imports is no way to face the economic crisis!!!
?
?
?
At last
The increasing crime rate in the country is most reprehensible but the PM said last week that the crime rate had dropped while the Women and Children?s Bureau alone recorded a steep increase in crime!!! As this column has repeatedly pointed out, cases are always delayed or postponed and, according to the Justice Minister herself, there are 750,000 cases pending in Courts!!! Astronomical proportions of judicial delays!!! An Open Warrant has now been issued on Jaliya Wickramasuriya; what may we ask were the FCID doing all this time??? Jaliya is apparently conveniently following a course when he should be here in Sri Lanka behind bars!!! First, he was granted leave for medical treatment, which was also a fiasco and he failed to return; SO WHAT IS THE FCID DOING AND WHY IS IT TAKING SO LONG TO THROW THE BOOK AT ONE MAN??? Portfolio for Ravi??? That would be the biggest miscarriage of Justice!!! The burning question remains unanswered!!!
?
?
Lone voice? ?
One civic-conscious Minister, Nimal Siripala de Silva, has pointed out the absolute necessity to bring in new laws to prevent road accidents as they are taking a huge toll on our roads!!! We dealt with this issue before too but to no avail!!! Where have all the right-thinking, right-minded people gone, that they cannot see the crying need for stringent laws and heavy punishments to prevent the gruesome quota of road accidents and deaths of elephants???
?
?
Ice Police? ?
Our Police Department is in shambles beginning with allegations levelled against the IGP himself who has said he would resign!!! DIGs involved in high profile cases, Sergeants going berserk, CID submitting wrong evidence!!! Where can the common man look, if not to the Police Department when seeking JUSTICE??? When are we going to have a Police Department that we can look up to and have faith in??? The country is embroiled in crime with the Sri Lanka Cricket Fraud alone amounting to US$ 5.5 million and the IGP directed the CID to take over the investigations!!! In whom can the people repose their faith and trust???
?
?
Protocols? ?
Moving on to the absolutely ridiculous and a breach of diplomatic protocol, HIS EXCELLENCY THE AMBASSADOR TO QATAR A.S.P. LIYANAGE, acted as the porter cum bag carrier to the sons of MR when the Sri Lanka Rugby team arrived in Qatar!!! Apparently, Liyanage?s appointment to Qatar raised many an eyebrow but he was appointed anyway!!! Without discharging his diplomatic duties, he is noted for getting involved in matters that do not concern him!!! Liyanage?s posting in Qatar was taken up in Parliament recently!!!
?
?
?
Decent Politician? ?
The President has cautioned teachers to be realistic and compassionate with children who fail the Grade 5 Scholarship examinations, as children need understanding and not recriminations!!!
Having said this, we feel that Principals and teachers owe it to the children under their care to teach them that politicians with demented minds and sullied characters are people who should be avoided and not looked up to in our society!!!
Fortunately, we do have politicians with decent minds and excellent character, whom they could emulate and these politicians should be invited to their prize distributions and other celebrations; the children deserve that and should be encouraged to meet them, speak to them and try to emulate them, as far as possible!!! Young minds need to be nurtured from the beginning and set on the correct path and, as guardians of these minds, Principals and teachers have this moral responsibility!!!

Discovery of suspicious package: CNN news room in NY evacuated
	
Police evacuated The Time Warner Center in New York City ? which contains the headquarters of news network CNN ? after the discovery of a suspicious package addressed to former CIA Director John Brennan.
The evacuation from the sprawling, mixed-use building complex in the heart of Manhattan came as news broke about similar packages containing suspected explosives being sent to former president Barack Obama and former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
And it occured two days after an explosive device was found outside the home of philanthropist and Democratic backer George Soros, whose Westchester County, NY, home is located less than nine miles away Clinton's Chappaqua residence.
CNN reported that the package found at the Time Warner Center mailroom was addressed to Brennan in care of CNN. Brennan, a harsh critic of President Donald Trump, is a actually a contributor to MSNBC, a sister news network to CNBC.
CNN, in turn, has often been the target of criticism by Trump, who has called the network as "fake news."
A law enforcement official told NBC News that the four devices sent to the Time Warner Center, Obama, Clinton and Soros are "nearly identical."
CNN reported that metal material and wires in the package sent to the Time Warner Center were discovered by an X-ray scan. An NYPD bomb containment unit took the device out of the Time Warner Center after members of the public were pushed by police two blocks away from the complex.
The exteriors of the three packages sent to Obama, Clinton and Soros were manila in color, had stamps on them and carried a return address belonging to Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the former chairman of the Democratic National Commitee, according to NBC News.
Later Wednesday, the building containing the San Diego Union-Tribune was evacuated due to a suspicious package being found there, according to NBC's affiliate in San Diego.
New York police issued an alert warning people to avoid the area around Columbus Circle, the traffic roundabout adjacent to the west side of Central Park. The Time Warner Center is located on Columbus Circle.
President Donald Trump's Trump International Hotel & Tower New York is located opposite the Time Warner Center on the circle.
CNN President Jeff Zucker said the network found "no other devices" in a sweep of its bureaus around the world.
The Time Warner Center, which encompasses 2.8 million square feet of space, contains many high-end retail shops, restaurants, the Mandarin Hotel, luxury condominums, offices of the Related Companies and the Mack Real Estate Group, as well as the home of Jazz at Lincoln Center.
Trump tweeted about the devices after Vice President Mike Pence condemned "the attempted attacks." (CNBC)

Dissolving the Board of Directors - Shows they are corrupt: JO
	
President Maithripala Sirisena?s decision to replace the Board of Directors of the Bank of Ceylon, People?s Bank and the BOI shows that these institutions are corrupt similar to the Central Bank in the past, joint opposition (JO) MP Bandula Gunawardana said yesterday.
He said all these institutions were functioning in a manner that favoured certain individuals.
?We are shocked to see the deplorable state of affairs in these State banks and the BOI. The Board of Investments has become a haven for mega deals while the two State banks have lost the people?s confidence,? the MP told a news briefing.
He said the previous government was able to face the global economic crisis successfully and salvage the Seylan Bank which was on the brink of collapsing. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

## Title: Gamini Dissanayake Assassination  : The unkindest cut of all
## Section: Opinion
## Date: 24 October 2018 12:00 am
Gamini Dissanayake Assassination  : The unkindest cut of all
	
What makes Gamini?s death most consequential in the Twentieth Century???
?
?
?The important thing to know about an assassination or an attempted assassination is not who fired the shot, but who paid for the bullet.?
~Eric Ambler,?A Coffin for Dimitrios??
?
Lalith Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayake were both men of immense stature and education??
	Gamini knew his boundaries on political philosophy??
	Once said that he was one of the best products to market??
?
?
Two dozen years have gone by after the assassination of one of the greatest men who towered over the political life in Sri Lanka in the second half of the Twentieth Century. Gamini Dissanayake, as I knew him from the year he first entered Parliament in 1970, never ran out of steam.??
When the average line Minister or Parliamentarian at the time was most preoccupied with mundane duties in his or her electorate, Gamini tackled big things. His vision knew no horizon. Unlike other great politicians of his time such as J. R. Jayewardene and Dudley Senanayake and R. Premadasa, Gamini was neither behind nor ahead of his time. He just fitted into the present as the present was defined then.??
For instance, JR was far behind his time when he assumed power in 1977. JR, in fact, should have been the Prime Minister of Ceylon in the wake of the death of D.S. Senanayake.?
When Dudley asked him to take over the wheels of the State in 1951, (Source: Pages 258 and 259, J. R. Jayewardene of Sri Lanka by Professor K. M. de Silva and Howard Wriggins) JR refused to realize that Dudley was much more acceptable to the country at the time.??
Dudley had one significant advantage over anyone else as he was the son of the deceased Prime Minister D. S. Senanayake.??
Nevertheless, while JR?s refusal to take over the reins set him back almost two-and-half-decades in his ambition of leading Sri Lanka, Dudley?s takeover proved that he was not ready for the gruelling trail of political intrigue.??
R. Premadasa on the other hand, who would not have risen to the pinnacle of the United National Party (UNP) but for the fact that JR foresaw that the immediate future of the party lay in the hands of a populist leader, whose appeal to the d?class? of Sri Lankan voters, as a hardworking politician, whose work and hobby both were politics, as an ambitious self-driven politician was unmatched and unmatchable at the time and even since then.??
Yet, when R. Premadasa, the champion of the d?class?, voice of the poor and an exceptional leader of the underprivileged became a victim of a bomb blast, some took to the streets and lit crackers expressing their relief or somewhat joy at his death.??
Being cheerful at anybody?s demise is an absolutely despicable response to someone?s death. Collective cheerfulness assumes and injects even a more gruesome element into it making it seem ?acceptable? or forgivable in specific circumstances.??
R. Premadasa, with all his political plusses and minuses, did not deserve such human trash. Those who happened to light crackers at the death of R. Premadasa exhibited, if not anything else, a tremendously low sense of enmity and vengeance.
?
Gamini never stopped from then on. He once told me that he was one of the best products to market and, do exactly that- market him as one of the best political products
?
Bandaranaike?s assassination was the first political assassination in our short history of the post-independence era. Bandaranaike was one single politician who, whether one agreed with his groundbreaking policies or not, whose rhetoric never matched his performance as a pragmatic political leader.??
In fact, his deficiencies in the astute leadership of a nation ultimately tragically led Mapitigama Buddharakkhitha, a leading member of the five pillars of his political platform, Sanga, Veda, Guru, Govi and Kamkaru, to plan and plot his slaying. Bandaranaike led this country for three short years.??
Some of the policies and programmes he injected into the country?s polity had some far-reaching effects, which are being felt even today.??
The ill-effects of the Sinhala-only policy, nationalization of some profit-making companies and turning them into loss-making ones and placing financial burdens on the country?s ailing GDP are not very fond memories of the man.
The other two political assassinations, those of Lalith Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayake, belong to a totally different genre.??
Lalith Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayake were both men of immense stature and education.??
Their charisma glowed wherever they chose to go. They were neither behind nor ahead of their times.? ?
By 1977, Gamini had already been baptized by fire. His very entry into politics in 1970 was remarkable, to say the least.??
Dudley Senanayake?s read on the gullibility of our voters was much to be desired and below par for an experienced politician like him, four times Prime Minister.??
Dudley Senanayake was quite sure of victory at the 1970 elections. What happened, on the contrary, was a complete sweep for Sirimavo Bandaranaike-led coalition. The only UNP newcomer to Parliament was, when giants fell by the wayside, the solitary figure of Gamini Dissanayake.??
Yet, Gamini lost his seat due to an election petition and ironically, when Felix Dias Bandaranaike introduced an Act in Parliament to pave the way for Nalanda Ellawala of Ratnapura, who, like Gamini, was unseated by way of an election petition, to contest again, Gamini was one of the beneficiaries of this ?Act? by Felix Dias.??
From that time onwards, Gamini Dissanayake had his focus on much higher ideals instead of just being satisfied with being a Parliamentarian or even a frontline Minister.??
Gamini never stopped from then on. He once told me that he was one of the best products to market and, do exactly that- market him as one of the best political products.??
He also knew his boundaries on the political philosophy that he chose to follow. After learning of the demise of R. Premadasa, Gamini and I were travelling back to Colombo from Kandy. He asked me a direct question:??
?Palitha, can we work with Chandrika and the SLFP????
Before I could reply, he answered his own question.??
?
Gamini Dissanayake?s assassination stands out as the most destructive and consequential one in terms of depriving Sri Lanka of a potential Nation Builder
?
?We can?t. The gulf between the UNP and the SLFP is too wide. Our political philosophies are way too mutually exclusive. Our problem was with Premadasa, not the UNP. I?m going to meet Wijetunga (President D. B. Wijetunga) and rejoin the party that elected me many a time to Parliament. I?m going back home!? he said.??
Gamini?s marketability was exhibited without a shadow of doubt when the Leader of the Opposition slot became vacant. After leaving the party and having worked against it and the then leader R. Premadasa, Gamini came back and defeated Ranil Wickremesinghe by two (2) votes to become the Leader of the Opposition.??
The UNP Parliamentarians wanted a ?winner?, who could take the party back to power.??
One memorable event during the Presidential Election campaign in 1994 was when Gamini was surrounded by the so-called intelligentsia in the country in an open debate.??
Gamini shredded them to pieces and showed the country what an intellectual giant she would be privileged to be led by when Gamini Dissanayake held his sway in the midst of a politically-charged debate that was televised to the country.??
Gamini?s death was the most consequential one in the Twentieth Century. There is no argument about that.
Political assassinations have occurred in human history more than one could write about in volumes. More and more such assassinations will recur in the future too.??
In an unforgiving and brutally competitive sphere of human endeavour, politicians, especially in not-so-democratic countries, which have not blossomed out to be full and all-inclusive liberal societies- countries that are governed by ?Republican Constitutions?- are deeply engrossed in populist and people-oriented politics.??
In such environments, opportunities for political assassins are aplenty and a quick rise to power is so alluring.??
Of all political assassinations, from S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike, R. Premadasa, Lalith Athulathmudali to Gamini Dissanayake, with all due respect and empathy for others, Gamini Dissanayake?s assassination stands out as the most destructive? and consequential one in terms of depriving Sri Lanka of a potential, as J. N. Dixit, the former Indian High Commissioner of Sri Lanka wrote in his book, Assignment Colombo, a Nation Builder. In fact, it was the unkindest cut of all.??

Getting set for leave-taking!
	
?
A small group of highly agitated Diyawanna Blues had recently called on the Rajarata young stalwart, who was one of the handful that pole-vaulted to yahapalanaya at the very outset.
?
They had gone to meet the Rajarata politico to deliver an ultimatum: That they were opposed to teaming up with the faction that they had ditched once and were set to quit yahapalanaya if the move was not called off.
The Rajarata stalwart had reportedly told these unhappy colleagues that he too was highly upset over the development and the Lokka was paying no heed to his protesting.?
He had added: ?Don?t quit. Because, if you quit at this stage, you would be at a disadvantage. Let us bide our time and make a decisive move only as a last resort.?
The unhappy ones had left the place after agreeing to this suggestion, they say.

Govt. must do its best to have UNHRC resolution withdrawn
	
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka told the Cabinet yesterday that the government should launch diplomatic efforts to withdraw its co-sponsorship of the UNHRC resolution on Sri Lanka.
He said the government should also make every effort to replace the current resolution.
The minister said this when the Cabinet discussed the Bill to set up the National Truth Commission and pointed out that the government had taken several steps as far as reconciliation was concerned.
He cited the Office of Missing Persons, the Office for Reparation, and various commissions appointed during the former rule as steps taken in this direction.
However, the minister said there was no reciprocity from the other side. He said some countries such as Britain were lenient towards the LTTE activists because of the present approach by the government. (Kelum Bandara)

H?tota Wind Farm to be removed
	
The Hambantota Wind Farm, the only CEB-owned wind power plant, which was commissioned in 1999, is being disassembled to be removed owing to the high amount of rent the CEB has to pay for the land and also due to its less efficiency, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) said.
The CEB said that it did not have any concrete decision as of yet on relocating the towers at a separate land.
According to unconfirmed sources, the CEB had to pay a colossal amount of Rs. 23 million as rent to the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) for the land, following the agreement signed between the Chinese Company and the SLPA to lease out the Hambantota Port and several adjacent land plots.
CEB Spokesperson Sulakshana Jayawardena said both the wind power plant and its technology were outdated and that it was not viable to maintain the plant by paying a higher rent.
?There are five towers at the farm but only three are operational at the moment.
?It is not practical to have it at that particular location while paying a rent to the SLPA. If you make a high amount as a rent while maintaining the power plant which provides the only 3MW to the grid, the purpose is lost.
?Not having this plant will make no significant impact on the system. No point in keeping the power plant as it is. Power plants too have life spans. When the time comes, the efficiency goes down.
?Having considered the economic and the technological requirements and other aspects, the CEB decided to remove the towers,? he told the Daily Mirror.
He said the CEB had a plan to relocate the wind towers at a land of the Sustainable Energy Authority (SEA) at Hambantota, where there was also a solar power plant, but added the plan was not final.
?The Director General of the SEA said they are planning to put up wind towers at this particular land but they are thinking about the cost. Hopefully, we will be able to install them at the solar park but it depends on how feasible and economically viable it is,? he said.
Defending the move to remove the towers, he said the towers are not performing at an efficient level.
?The plant was put up at the late 90s. The relocation depends on how feasible it is to reinstall them somewhere else because there is a cost to dismantle and also to reinstall. However, the CEB is removing the towers in a systematic manner so then we can reinstall it at another place if we want and can,? Mr Jayawardena said.
However, employees of the Wind Farm and CEB Trade Unions expressed sentiments against the move to remove the wind farm claiming it could incur an additional cost to the state.
?The move to remove wind towers by spending millions of rupees and probably sell them for scrap metal is absurd. The CEB could have simply relocated the towers at a separate land. If that is not a viable option, the CEB should have allowed a private firm to remove it at their expense. As of Wednesday, the operations of all five wind towers had been terminated,? an employee said.
They charged the CEB was bringing in technicians from India coupled with heavy machinery by spending Rs.45 million to remove the towers.
Meanwhile, General Secretary of the CEB Employees' Union Ranjan Jayalal said the CEB, which is unable to pay the rent any more, was attempting to remove wind towers from the land for scrap metal.
The CEB rejected the allegations and said it called for tenders following the procedures to remove the wind towers.
?We evaluated the proposals received and then selected the most benefited company to do the job,? it said.
The Hambantota Wind Farm is Sri Lanka?s first commissioned wind farm and it was constructed with both state and foreign funds. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Responding to journalists after visiting the Henakaduwa Temple at Tangalle, Mr Rajapaksa, however, said the act of one of the Ministers working for the RAW would amount to treason.
?The Government always creates a mess. It is hard to say that there are Ministers with affiliations to the RAW.

## Title: Lack of morality leads to disaster

Lack of morality leads to disaster
	
?He is truly virtuous, wise and righteous, who neither for his own sake nor for the sake of another (does any wrong), who does not crave for sons, wealth, power, or kingdom, and does not desire his own success by unjust means.?
?
?
?
Moral behaviour and virtuous conduct are very significant aspects which are highly appreciated in the teaching of the Buddha. Lack of morality and respect leads people to form a fearful, dreadful and distressing society. Disparity between human beings and animals is the moral conduct and discipline. Sometimes, we meet well-trained and well-tamed animals better than some immoral and nefarious individuals in our society. Domestic violence, intimidation, threat, cyber bullying, sexual harassment and assault, abuse and violence are abundant and numbers are escalating due to the lack of virtuous conduct and respect for others.?
Vajji, the capital of Vaishali, was a very prosperous city in ancient India. People in the state of Vesali, Vajjians were the well-cultured and well-mannered individuals who have been praised and appreciated by the Blessed One. Unfortunately that reputation and dignity have drastically disappeared nowadays. Now it is history and only remains in books. Back then, men have protected and respected all females in the state of Vesali and Buddha once mentioned that it was one of the seven principles for their prosperity, but now that peaceful and honourable society have dreadfully changed everywhere in the world. Although we boast about our history and culture, the whole society has become topsy-turvy.?
?
The five precepts (Pancasila) constitute the most fundamental moral code? taught by the Blessed One: abstaining from killing, stealing or taking? what is not given, sexual misconduct, false speech and the use of? intoxicants
?
Multitudes of people destructively criticize and blame innovative digital devices, social media, proliferation of multifaceted apparatus and information superhighway, but I personally believe that lack of self-management and discipline and the failure of moral development are the prime factors which create multifarious conflicts and disasters in our society today.?
Fear, anxiety, terror, distress, tension, agitation, worry and nervousness are the main burdens and tribulations. If one?s moral conduct is positively matured, one gives fearlessness, kindness, compassion and respect not only to the immediate family but also to the whole society.?
Virtuous behaviour is cultivated by undertaking precepts and acting in accordance with the ten meritorious deeds. The five precepts (Pancasila) constitute the most fundamental moral code taught by the Blessed One: abstaining from killing, stealing or taking what is not given, sexual misconduct, false speech and the use of intoxicants.?
If someone honestly follows and doesn?t violate the precepts, he or she is regarded as a virtuous person.?
?
?What, monks, is accomplishment in virtuous behaviour? Here, a noble disciple abstains from the destruction of life, abstains from taking what is not given, abstains from sexual misconduct, abstains from false speech, abstains from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. This is called accomplishment in virtuous behaviour.?
(The Buddha-AN)?
?
?
?All tremble at violence, all fear death.
Putting oneself in the place of another,
One should not kill nor cause another to kill.?
?One who, while himself seeking happiness oppresses with violence other beings who also desire happiness, will not attain happiness hereafter.?
?Blessed is virtue until life?s end;
Blessed is faith that is steadfast;
Blessed is the acquisition of wisdom;
And blessed is the avoidance of evil.?
(Dhammapada)?
?
?
The foundation of moral conduct should be commenced from childhood. Parenting is not just a giving birth. It is a very big responsibility and a huge commitment. As parents, they should offer a well-disciplined, well-cultured and well-mannered citizen to the society. That person should not be hurtful, harmful and fearful for the humanity and to other beings. Therefore, the duties and responsibilities of parents are very crucial.?
Twenty-six centuries ago, the Buddha compassionately emphasised very important duties which should be performed by parents towards their children. These duties mould and lead a child towards a successful, happy and peaceful life. Parents are designated as ?First Teachers? by the Blessed One. Their paramount duties include teaching children what is wholesome and unwholesome.?
?
Multitudes of people destructively criticize and blame innovative digital devices, social media, proliferation of multifaceted apparatus and information superhighway, but I personally believe that lack of self-management and discipline and the failure of moral development are the prime factors which create multifarious conflicts and disasters in our society today
?
In a special discourse in our Pali canon ?Sigalovada Sutta? -- Advice to the Son of Householder Sigala, the Perfectly Enlightened One -- Lord Buddha remarkably elaborated wonderful duties and responsibilities which should be performed towards all members in our human society.?
Parents duties as follows:?
Dissuading and discouraging from evil or unwholesome behaviour?
Teaching them moral values?
Giving them a good education and training them in a profession?
Helping them to make a good and happy marriage?
Letting them inherit the family wealth at a proper time.?
If you ignore and neglect the first two duties, the consequences will be dangerous and disastrous. Unfortunately, most parents exclusively concentrate on better education and paper qualification. Most of them are infatuated and hypnotized in materialistic commercial culture. They are entangled in the network of craving and selfishness. The behaviour and exemplary lives of parents, school and religious teachers or clergy and proper advice are very important to influence the child. If these eminent individuals are poor in these qualities and moral values, what can we expect from our young generation??
Unfortunately, crime rates are very high and increasing on a daily basis. If one undertakes the five precepts and lead one?s life without violating them, that person gives freedom to others to live without fear and terror.?
We should educate our children on the danger and consequences of wrongdoing and unwholesome activities. Numerous evidence, testimonies and stories are apparent and conspicuous in printed and digital media. This makes us aware that lack of morality horrendously leads to disaster.?
?
Parenting is not just a giving birth. It is a very big responsibility? and a huge commitment. As parents, they should offer a well-disciplined,? well-cultured and well-mannered citizen to the society?
?
As a nation, in terms of leaders and leadership, we cannot be proud of ourselves. Our leaders and their henchmen are corrupted. In terms of moral conduct and values, they have failed miserably. As a nation, we utterly failed to select and elect a true leader to govern the country.?
Hope that educated and wise young people will find a suitable and righteous person who respects the rule of law and order to govern the country to make it disciplined.?
?He is truly virtuous, wise and righteous, who neither for his own sake nor for the sake of another (does any wrong), who does not crave for sons, wealth, power, or kingdom, and does not desire his own success by unjust means.?(Dhammapada)?

Light Railway construction to begin next year
	
Construction work of the proposed light railway system would begin at the end of next year, the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry said yesterday.
Ministry Additional Secretary Madhawa Waidyaratna said that seven railway tracks had been identified by the ministry under the proposal.
Meanwhile, it was announced that the feasibility study on one railway track had been concluded and the construction work would begin soon with funds from Japan.
The ministry expects to construct the rest of the six lines under three packages as a Private Public Partnership (PPP).
According to the proposal one line with a total distance of 33km would be constructed from Ragama to Kirulapone via Kadawatha, Fort and Bambalapitiya.
The 28.3km long second line would be constructed from Kelaniya to Moratuwa via Dematagoda, Borella, Narahenpita and Nugegoda.
The 22.3 km long third line would be constructed from Hunupitiya Tire Junction to Kottawa via Koswatta.
Mr. Waidyaratna said that they will select six foreign companies from 17 that had submitted tenders for the project.
The ministry had allowed these companies until the end of February 2019 to submit their bids for the project.
Mr. Waidyaratna said that with the proposed light railway train system the whole of Colombo and its suburbs would be covered.
He went on to say that after the light rail system comes into operation fully commuters will be able to reach their destinations much quicker while it would also greatly help to lessen heavy traffic congestion in the city and its outskirts. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Mahavamsa 2500-year history of heroic Sinhalay people mellowed by humanity
	
?
The Mahavamsa or The Great Chronicle of Ceylon (to use the title of the English translation by Wilhelm Geiger of the ancient classic) is a book of history in the form of a poem in the Pali language composed by a Bhikkhu named Mahanama at Anuradhapura around the latter part of the 5th or the beginning of the 6th century CE (Common Era). This work was commissioned by King Dhatusena (c. 460 -478 CE).
Prof. Wilhelm Geiger translated into German; his own revised critical edition of the Pali original, which had been published in 1908. He added an introduction, appendices and notes to the German version. Mabel Haynes Bode put Geiger?s German translation into English. Prof. Geiger then revised Ms. Bode?s English translation. Geiger?s Mahavamsa is in prose. Its first edition, prepared by T.W. Rhys Davids, was published in 1912.? ?
There are several other translations of the Mahavamsa produced before and after this date by local and foreign scholars such as George Turnour (1837), L.C. Wijesinghe (1889), and Ananda W.P. Guruge (1989), to name some of them. My personal opinion as a lay reader is that the local Sinhalese translators of the book are better guides to its meaning than European oriental scholars because of the former?s natural cultural affinity with the work and their intuitive attunement to its broad communicative frequency; and it is a fact that visiting European scholars were automatically inclined to consider themselves as being in the intellectual vanguard of those colonizing powers, who hypocritically believed that they were bearing the so-called ?white man?s burden? of forcing European civilizational values on them. Naturally, such scholars were reluctant to acknowledge the actual cultural superiority of the Sinhalese that they wanted to ?civilize?. However, among them Geiger could be an exception. He betrays little evidence of any ?orientalist? prejudice (defined by Edward Said in his 1978 book ?Orientalism?) against the Sinhalese whose ancient cultural-historical classic he tried to interpret.? ?
It was fortunate for us that Western scholars such as Geiger and Rhys Davids tried to understand our history and culture reasonably free from preconceived notions of their own superiority over the ?natives? usually prevalent among imperialistic Europeans at that time. Apart from this, the Geiger translation is still the best known and the most commonly used one, particularly among foreign scholars interested in the island history; it is probably the most authentic English version of The Great Chronicle done by any non-Sinhalese translator. This is the justification of my choice of the Geiger translation as the main source of this brief essay on the monumental work from a nonacademic ordinary reader?s point of view.? ?
?
The Mahavamsa is a serious book of history, though it was composed at least 1500 years before modern concepts of historiography evolved
?
The Mahavamsa is a cherished symbol of the national identity of the Sinhalese, the builders of the unique two and a half millennia old island civilization. Sri Lanka (known in history by an array of different names such as Sivhela/Sihela/Sinhale, Serendib/Swarnadipa, Rathnadeepa, etc) abounds in the ruins of ancient monuments and also restored edifices that bear testimony to that unbroken island-wide historical achievement. There is no evidence of any other independent parallel civilization having evolved within its boundaries. The Mahavamsa gives the Sinhalese a feeling of continuity of nationhood. The danger of the Mahavamsa becoming an unnecessary casualty of ethnic politics is real, but such a fate is something unthinkable for us as a race with a distinct history.? ?
It is criticized by some because it does not provide a historical precedent that might support their unjust political claims. Some others treat it with contempt claiming that it divides the Sri Lankans. The truth is that the Mahavamsa refers to the close links that existed between Lanka and India in propitious circumstances in early times, which should actually unite rather than divide different races. Then there are those ?enlightened? individuals who just cannot tolerate even the mention of the legitimate claims of the Sinhalese! They are racists who, nevertheless, have no qualms about sticking the label on their victims, the Sinhalese.? ?
The Mahavamsa is a serious book of history, though it was composed at least 1500 years before modern concepts of historiography evolved. Bhikkhu Mahanama, the author, at the very opening relates himself to the existing historical literature and popular traditions thus: ?That (Mahavamsa) which was compiled by the ancient (sages) was here too long drawn out and there too, closely knit; and contained many repetitions. Attend ye now to this (Mahavamsa) that is free from such faults, easy to understand and remember, arousing serene joy and emotion and handed down (to us) by tradition, - (attend ye to it) while that ye call up serene joy and emotion (in you) at passages that awaken serene joy and emotion.? Mahanama?s? Mahavamsa comes to a conclusion in Chapter 37, which deals with the reign of King Mahasena (c. 325 ? 352 CE).? ?
The subject of the Mahavamsa is the early phase of the history of the Sinhalese race and that of the establishment of the Buddhist faith in the island. But the Mahavamsa was later continued up to the end of the 18th century by different authors at different times (in the form of the Culavamsa) The Culavamsa opens in the middle of the 37th chapter where the earlier Mahavamsa came to an abrupt end, and completes the 101th chapter which ends thus: ?After they had brought the King, the torturer of his people, to the opposite coast the Ingirisi by name seized the whole kingdom? (i.e. the British took possession of the whole island with the capture of the last king of Sinhale Sri Wickrema Rajasinghe in 1815). The Mahavamsa has been updated since, and now comprises the whole history of the island to date. So the 6th century Mahavamsa covers roughly the first eight hundred years of the island civilization since the legendary Vijaya, which period ended about 150 years before the reconstruction of its history by Mahanama.? ?
It is appropriate to consider against this background where we are at present in our understanding of our history as a nation (a group of people occupying a specific geographical space, speaking a unique language and generally identified with one spiritual tradition). Today, we have a more national minded generation of local archaeologists and historiographers than before who are free from the enslaving influence of orientalist prejudices of the past, and who are inspired by a sense of ?apekame? (lit. usness) or national pride. Their researches are breaking new ground in the field. For example, the findings of foreign and locally trained archaeologists Shiran Deraniyagala (e.g., relicts of a pre-Vijayan civilization found in excavations in the inner city of Anuradhapura) and Raj Somadeva (objects dug up and rock inscriptions deciphered at many places across the island including Kuragala, Welmeethalawa, and Kegalle, and a gold sheet writing discovered at Vallipuram in Jaffna, for instance) prove beyond doubt that the Sinhalese have a much longer and a more glorious history than that celebrated in the Mahavamsa. Such successful challenges to the authority of the Mahavamsa represent a tribute to its avowed commitment to the elimination of defects found in earlier treatises such as the Dipawansa, which it uses as its sources.? ?
The pre-Vijayan culture predates Vijaya by at least three centuries. Somadeva?s findings (pieces of pottery, bone ornaments, iron implements, clay receptacles found at burial/cremation sites, etc which are signs of a sophisticated culture) have been determined to be over 4350 years through radiocarbon dating. The important thing to mark here is that this culture was independent of any foreign (that is, Indian or other) influence, unlike the Sinhala Buddhist civilization historicized by the Mahavamsa narrative. The brightening prospects of revealing these more ancient historical roots of the Sinhalese (according to Somadeva these could be as old as 6000 years) should not be seen as an emergent threat to the status of the Mahavamsa as the incomparable national monument it is. It only proves that the Sinhalese were heir to a much older, and certainly more advanced civilization than the Mahavamsa author dared to credit them with. The unlocking of the ancient secrets of our history through the use of technologies that are the most advanced to date will be in the interest of not only the Sinhalese and the minorities that make Sri Lanka their common home, but also of the whole of humanity.? ?
The grand purpose of the Mahavamsa? author?s whole endeavour was, after all, to compile this history ??for the serene joy and emotion of the pious?, (as the less than ideal English rendering of the original Pali phrase tells us). The book is intended to generate ?serene joy and emotion? in the pious. Each chapter of the Mahavamsa and its sequel theCulavamsa ends with the postscript ?Here ends the ? chapter, called ???.?, in the Mahavamsa, compiled for the serene joy and emotion of the pious?. (Prof. Geiger glosses the two terms pasada(serene joy) and samvega (emotion) thus: ?Pasada? signifies the feeling of blissfulness, joy and satisfaction in the doctrine of Gauthama Buddha, samvega the feeling of horror and recoil from the world and its misery?. This historic monument must be cherished for its humanity as much as for its value as a historical document. It is this noble culture of humanity inspired by Theravada Buddhism that made Sri Lanka a secure home for diverse minorities living in harmony with the majority Sinhalese. Suppressing it is not the way to bring about communal harmony in the land.? ?

MS saying DS' UNP is no more is a joke: SF
	
Responding to the statement made by President Maithripala Sirisena that the UNP founded by the late D S Senanayake was no more, Minister Sarath Fonseka said yesterday DS was engaged in a different kind of politics during his time.
?Leaders such as former prime minister D.S Senanayake were engaged in a different kind of politics because he was striving to free the country from British rule. If one tries to engage in such politics that person will be labeled as a mad man. One must also remember that there are no Bandaranaikes in the SLFP today. The UNP was led by several leaders such as J R Jayewardene, Ranasinghe Premadasa and D B Wijetunga. If someone tries to become another D S Senanayake it will be a joke,? the minister told a media briefing. ?The statement that the UNP of the late D S Senanayake is gone makes me laugh."
When asked by journalists about allegations that four ministers had links with RAW, the minister said no one can accuse any minister of having connections with RAW just because they talk of an alleged plot to kill the President.
?The talk about four ministers connected to RAW was popped by the statement made by the Hindu journalists that the ministers spoken about a RAW plot to kill the President. One cannot label ministers as RAW agents just because they talked to this journalist. Associating with RAW is an offence,? he said.
Referring to the Reparation Bill, the minister said paying compensation to those such as former LTTE combatants, who were engaged in anti-government activities, was against the constitution. ?However compensation should be paid to state officers if they die or sustain injuries while performing their duties,? he said.

He said it was doubtful why the new Constitution was brought in amidst public protest and added that Maha Sanga also urged not to do so.
?Maha Sanga requested only to bring in amendments if needed. This is brought with a hidden agenda. NGOs and foreign forces are trying to invade the whole nation and ruin country?s traditions.
Ven. Ananda Mahanayaka Thera said the new Constitution leads the country to chaos and communal clashes adding that it was a threat to the national reconciliation.
?That is what the external forces want. Those who bring in this Constitution want to unstable this country politically and disrupt it completely,? he said.
The Thera said the Constitution should meant to uplift the economy and living condition through the development of economy, education, health and moral values of all nations equally and added that if not such a move should be nip it in the bud.
He said people should get together to form a new leader who was free of political obligations and accepted by the whole country to safeguard the country from the new constitution detrimental to the country.
He said ?We cannot expect politicians to do it. They see both the country and the nation through their political party. They do not see the party through the country. People should now pay attention on a new leadership who do not see that manner. That new leadership should not emerge from politicians. He should be devoid of politics and accepted by the whole country. We must act together to form such a leader,? the Thera said.
Ven. Elle Gunawansa Thera said the government had already had set the background to bring in a new constitution by enacting most of the acts and bills in parliament such as the Enforced Disappearances Bill, Reparation Bill and Provincial Councils Amendment Bill.
The Thera appealed the government not to make the country which is considered as the pearl of the Indian Ocean as the drop of tears.
Former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, former chief justice Sarath N Silva, Senior Lecturer of University of Colombo Dr. Lalithasiri Gunaruwan participated in the event. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Not a single medicinal drug withdrawn: Rajitha
	
Not a single essential medicinal drug has been removed from the market other than to replace those that have remained for long periods on pharmacy shelves with new and better drugs, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said yesterday.
He said the global drug trade was changing rapidly with new and better drugs replacing older versions.
"When a new drug arrives in the market it is natural for older drug to lose its demand and therefore has to be replaced with the new drugs which is always better than the old one because it comes to the market after clinical and field studies. As such it is malicious and stupid to say that certains drug are not available. If a certain brand of drug is not available then there are many others substitutes to fill the void," the minister said.
He said the government had reduced the prices of 73 essential drugs in the past few months thus halving the monthly drug bill of those suffering from diabetes, heart ailments, gastritis and kidney ailments.
National Medicinal Drug Regulatory Authority (NMRA) Chairman Prof. Asitha De Silva said the media reports on drug shortages were wrong and journalists must base their reports not on hearsay but on facts and figures and must not write articles just because some one wants them written.
?The local medicinal drug market is worth some Rs.145 billion. The government reduced the prices of 73 essential drugs which is a huge relief to millions of patients. We did it on the instructions of the World Health Organization (WHO). The misleading and malicious canard serves only drug companies, not patients,? he said.
Prof. De Silva said not a single essential drug was been removed from pharmacies without a better substitute replacing it and neither had a single drug importer or distributor informed the NMRA about the withdrawal of medicinal drugs from the market as alleged by the media.
All Ceylon private Pharmacies Association Chairman Chandika Gankanda said the price reduction on medicinal drugs was a huge benefit to patients but a loss to pharmacies.
?Drugs are taken off the shelves when they reach their use-by-dates and there is no demand for them. It is sad to see that drug mafia giving a different interpretation to this normal procedure,? he said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Pay back University teacher loans - EDITORIAL
	
The recent advertisement on the university teachers, who defaulted after having received huge amounts of money from the Government as loans for further education in various countries, is the manifestation of an appalling mentality in many people of the country.??
Further reports on the advertisement say that majority of these university teachers had not at least returned to the country.??
The number of university teachers ? including those holding Doctorates and Professorships - is a mind-boggling 486 and the amount they had defaulted is Rs. 813 million, according to the University Grants Commission (UGC). Many of them are employed in other countries now, according to the reports. There may be people among these university teachers, who had fought for the allocation of six percent of the GDP for the education, which was a major demand by the academia.??
Except for a very few, who had gone to International Schools, the entire student population whether they are attending schools or universities are being taught with the funds allocated annually by the budget and sometimes Government pumps more money for education and higher education through supplementary estimates. And needless to say that this is the tax levied from the ordinary people, including those who toil in chenas in the dry zone and those who sweep the roads in Colombo.??
In spite of parents spending huge amounts of money on tuition classes, the education in schools and universities is ?free? or State or taxpayer-funded.??
Despite questions having been raised on the dedication and commitment of some of the teachers in schools and universities, Government spends millions of tax-payers? money each year on each child studying in schools and universities. Hence, every person who had attended Government schools at least one or two years is indebted to the country and the people, morally.??
Therefore, it goes without saying that it is a punishable national crime on the part of the university teachers to default public funds obtained by way of loans for postgraduate education, after having received all these benefits during their studies in schools as well as in universities. They are indebted not only in financial terms but also in moral terms, as mentioned before.??
Nobody can argue that these university teachers who had defaulted on the loans they had obtained from the Government found better opportunities in other countries after they obtained the postgraduate education in those countries.??
They should definitely have had the prior knowledge of those opportunities and most probably had premeditated the default of public funds and their brain drain. They do so as they are paid in those countries several folds of what they earn here.??
That only fact, signifies their financial capability to repay at least the loans they obtained, leave alone the moral indebtedness to the country and its people.??
Some argue that publishing an advertisement on the default of loans by the university teachers would tarnish the good names of the universities. However, it is ironic to think that the image of the universities would be tarnished by the exposure of the defaulters and not by defaulting on the public funds by the university teachers.??
One may also argue that people migrate to other countries due to the degenerated situation in every sphere of society in Sri Lanka. School teachers leave the teaching to the tuition classes; doctors are fond of prescribing more and more medical tests for patients, compelling the Government to ban some tests at private hospitals for patients in State hospitals; only hope of the politicians irrespective of their parties who wax eloquent on morality on every platform is plundering public funds in millions, if not billions; traders sell food discarded as animal food to their fellow citizens; transport in urban areas is a nightmare; no decent man can use public transport; even some religious issues are being looked through political prism. Yes, there are reasons to leave for a better place to live, in a way.??
Yet, this is an invalid argument when it comes to the question of the university teachers who do not repay their loans. Because how can one expect dedication and commitment towards the country and its people from others, if he or she is not prepared at least to repay the loan he or she obtained from public coffers, even when he or she gets a high salary and perks abroad?? ? ?

A group of Green backbenchers had the other day met secretly to discuss an issue that was causing them much annoyance: the inexplicable delay in sending the discredited Khaki Chief home.

?They assure us that he would be soon sent home! But that doesn?t happen!?? One of them had articulated their common grouse.
?May we issue a hard-hitting statement to the media?? another had suggested.?
?Do it and then it is we ourselves who may have to go home!? a third one had expressed his concern.
?May we get our actor-buddy?s man for all seasons Matara Sunil to do the needful?? a fourth one had suggested.
However, this suggestion had brought forth a general protest.?
?Ammo! We too may get a ticket to the State lodge! Just see the number of court cases Matara Sunil Aiya is involved in!? One backbencher said and all others readily agreed!

This big-mouthed politico is a member of the top team. He is Blue, but ready to turn Green if need be.

He had been lately seen frequenting the Kandy area.
He had not been visiting the sacred city just for the fun of it. He is reportedly interested in purchasing a prime property about three acres in extent worth about Rs. 2 billion which he had considered as an ideal spot for a big business venture.
The deal, they say, is about to be wrapped up. But, to quote what a Green colleague of his had recently remarked, he is not a fool to buy the property in his name. There is a front-man set to sign the documents on his behalf!
The question now teasing those who are in the know of this land deal is how this dude who made it to Diyawanna through the list after losing his seat, could make a fortune to buy a property worth so much.
Informed sources say that this is only the prologue. What is more interesting is the story to follow!

SE University closed indefinitely from this evening
	
The Administration of the South Eastern University had decided to close the University indefinitely from this evening, Registrar H. Abdul Saththar said.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror he said the decision was taken by the University Administration after a group of Technology Faculty students lay siege on the administrative building since October 12.
?17 students have gathered at the Administration premises demanding the authorities to reinstate four students who were dismissed over ragging,? he said.
A group of students was investigating over ragging several students in the University. After investigations the University Grants Commission (UGC) decided to dismiss the studentship of four students in the Technology Faculty.
The Administration had lodged a complaint with the Akkaraipattu Police and the Akkaraipattu Magistrate Court has ordered the dispersal of the students from the Administration premises by today.
But the Akkaraipattu Police were unable to remove the students from the building and later the Administration had decided to close all six faculties indefinitely from 4.00 p.m today. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

SriLankan Airlines Commission: There were practices above the law- fmr. minister
	
There were practices above the law; no matter what laws are created practices are higher. Whether it is a violation of a law at some points a minister has to take that decision because it was the practice at that time, former Civil Aviation Minister Priyankara Jayaratne yesterday told the SriLankan Airlines Commission
The former minister informed the Commission that although he was the line minister who had to handle the aviation sector in the country, he was not aware about most of the decisions taken by then SriLankan Airlines Board of Directors between the periods of 2010-2015.
He informed the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) on irregularities at SriLankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering and Mihin Lanka that during the period 2010-2015 the SriLankan Airlines had directly coordinated through the Finance Ministry and the Board of Directors also appointed according to Finance Ministry?s decision. During that time former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was the Finance Minister, he said.
When Additional Solicitor General, Neil Unamboowe PC questioned about the Public Enterprises Department (PED) guidelines of appointing Board of Directors to SriLankan Airlines, former Minister informed the Commission that he was not aware about PED guidelines.
?There were practices above the law,? he informed the Commission.
He said when appointing Board of Directors within the period of 2010-2015 to SriLankan Airlines, he had been not informed by the SriLankan or the government about the nominees for the SriLankan Board, only the appointment letters of Board of Directors were sent to him.
?They only sent me the appointment letters and the appointments are made according to the decisions taken by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. I know that then SriLankan Chairman Nishantha Wickremasinghe was a Planter before he was appointed as the SriLankan Chairman and he was the brother-in-law of former President,? he said.
He said that the SriLankan Airlines Board of Directors had not informed him about the five year business plan which created through an international aviation consultant named Via Capital but SriLanakan Airlines had requested USD 520 million to formulate the five year business plan and for the capital infusion by the Cabinet through the line ministry.
Former Minister also said that he had appointed an independent committee to inquire about the five year business plan but the committee had also failed to inform him about the plan.
He also said that the SriLankan had not coordinated with the ministry about borrowing new aircraft to the company and it was not informed to the ministry.
When querying him about the difficulties to handle the Civil Aviation Ministry at that time he said that he had informed twice about the difficulties to handle the ministry to former President?s Chief of Staff Gamini Senarath but he had not received any answer.
Additional Solicitor General, Neil Unamboowe along with Senior State Council Fazly Razik and State Counsel Sajith Bandara led the evidence. (Yoshitha Perera)

This sibling occupying the main chair of a State-run body oiling the nation has been truanting for some time, they say.

The dude had gone missing ever since his boss, the elder one had asked him to step down with grace.
The rift between the siblings had started when the elder one had decided to dispose of what the younger one had been proposing ? mostly things questionable!
Although the oil chief is keeping away from work, he regularly draws his monthly pay - a hefty amount and enjoys all other perks that go with the post.
If a close pal quietly asks him why he is staying put when he is getting a shabby deal from the elder one, he would say: ?None can send me out! I have been born before those trying to send me out!?

The IMO effect
	
?
During the last few weeks I have read couple of stories on Sri Lankan usage of Imo, the messaging and video calling App. They were written in dramatic style and with catchy headlines. At the core they were about disturbing criminal activity.??
There was one similarity, all of them spoke of how Imo accounts had been hacked and users blackmailed. One said how a young woman working in the garment sector had bought her first smart phone. Super excited as she was, she had wasted no time in downloading Imo to talk with her family and loved ones.??
?
?
Some random man calls this woman on Imo and they become quite friendly. That was till the said man started sending this lady nude pictures of her, the story does not explain how the pictures were obtained or whether they are genuine or fake
?
Then the story takes a turn to the lurid. Some random man calls this woman on Imo and they become quite friendly. That was till the said man started sending this lady nude pictures of her, the story does not explain how the pictures were obtained or whether they are genuine or fake, but the assumption was that they were and have been taken from the memory of the phone.??
The poor woman was blackmailed and kept paying ransoms up to Rs.30,000 and then smashed her phone with a rock and disappeared till her husband found her and took the blackmailer to Police ? more or less a teledrama stuff!??
Not the first story of its kind. A colleague related how he kept getting messages with all kinds of innuendoes from a number used by an actress. He called her and was told that she was not sending the message which turned out to be a hacker, who was using the number to blackmail young men. I was not told whether this instance also ended up in a Police Station.??
?
She kept paying ransoms up to Rs.30,000 and then smashed her phone with a rock and disappeared till her husband found her and took the blackmailer to Police
?
Messaging Apps are the most popular downloads here in Sri Lanka. They make up the top four Android downloads in Sri Lanka, surprisingly Imo is number one here ? the only other country in the region where this makes it to the top three is Bangladesh. There is no doubt about its popularity but as we have seen it can be quite a risky app as well.??
Last year, cyber security officials warned the public to be wary of mobile messaging apps. They had been getting a stream of steady complaints of messaging apps being either hacked or misused. The easiest trick to hack into the Imo account of another user is to get the passcode for the app. Sometimes you really don?t need to be a techie to do this, you just need to be good at duping people. One of the ways of doing this is to call the genuine holder of the number and indicate that the app would have sent the passcode inadvertently. Users with at least somewhat of an understanding on digital hygiene would know that this is almost an impossibility, but many Sri Lankan users, especially those not well versed in English don?t seem to understand this. Many of the victims that have fallen victim to hacking have given out their passcodes themselves without their knowledge. Once the code is gained, the hacker has all the access needed to use the app.??
?

?
A Youtube search will also reveal that there are a few instruction videos of Sri Lankan origin talking about more elaborate hacking techniques, two of which I watched with a combined view count of over 100,000 talk specifically of hacking into Imo.??
As digital tech becomes popular in Sri Lanka, so will the dangers rise. Not many will be up to date with the security risks and fewer will take the effort to figure out the risks and mitigation measures. Right now, there is no public information outlet that provides this vital info. Such an outlet needs to also be updated consistently, a big ask from Sri Lanka?s pubic sector.?
?
Not many will be up to date with the security risks and fewer will take the effort to figure out the risks and mitigation measures. Right now, there is no public information outlet that provides this vital info.?
?
Unless this is taken over by the private sector and monetized ? you pay for the risk mitigation ? like virus guards, that probably will work here.??

UN request to withdraw Commander: Prez expresses concerns
	
President Maithripala Sirisena is reported to have expressed concerns at yesterday's Cabinet meeting about the UN request for the withdrawal of Lieut. Col. Kalana Amunupura -- the Commander of the 200-strong Sri Lankan military contingent deployed as part of the UN peace keeping mission in Mali.
He is said to have also raised concerns about the role played by Sri Lanka's Human Rights Commission on this matter.
The President had informed the Cabinet that the request for the withdrawal of Lieut. Col. Amunupura was influenced by allegations made by Yasmin Sooka, who had served in the committee appointed by the UN Secretary General to investigate allegations of war crimes in Sri Lanka.
According to sources, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is also reported to have said that Sri Lanka's Human Rights Commission had also made some allegations leading to the request for the withdrawal of this officer.
"It is sad if our own Human Rights Commission had done so," the President said. (Kelum Bandara)

Vap Poya Reflections : Katina ritual by Thai Theravaadin Controversy over meaning of term ?Katina?
	
?
According to Mahavagga Pali, the third book of Vinaya Pitaka, the Katina originated with the thirty forest-dwelling Pindapatika Bhikkhus who were on their way to Sravasti to visit the Lord Buddha. It was the rainy season, and the extreme weather forced the group to break journey as, ?Vassa.? However, after two days they resumed the journey in spite of the rain and reached Jetawana in Sravasti, wearing ragged-robes and exhausted, their robes soaked with mud and rainwater.?
The Blessed One, after hearing about the monks? tiring journey understood the agony of travelling monks in the rainy season decided to relax some of the rules for Bhikkhus, but ensured that they are applicable strictly during the rainy season or Vassana.?
There are two schools of thought, both of Theravada origin, that interpret the meaning of the word ?Katina? differently. Our scholars believe ?Katina? means hardness; hard as diamond, whereas the Thais interpret the word as originating from ?Katrina? which means ?weaving cloth.??
According to the Vinaya commentary, the ?ceremony and the robes? was called ?Katina? because the merit attained from the gift of robes was as hard as diamond. However, our scholars believe that the term implies stability, firmness or durability. The vas viseema or sojourn during the vas season and related rituals are carried out from the Vap Poya to Il Full Moon. All Theravadines accept as true that the Katina Pooja and related performances are the most commendable over all other ritualistic operations. The Buddha, according to scriptures, was very clear on this occurrence when he acknowledged that in this great performance the accrual of merit is limitless.?
?
THAI KATINA
In all Buddhist countries where Theravada sect prevails, Katina Pooja is a well-established custom. The Katina Cheewaraya as per observance is a thick robe stitched in a 24-hour day and night operation. Any Bhikkhu who had completed a rainy seasonal Vas is eligible to accept a Katina Cheewaraya. All other materials offered at a Katina Pooja ritual are considered as similarly valuable contributions.?
During an official visit to Bangkok some 15 years ago, the writer had the privilege of visiting a Thai temple some 100kms southeast of capital Bangkok on a Vap Full Moon Day. Taking time off the busy schedule and leaving the city hotel at around 5.00 a.m., we took the highway to reach the place in less than an hour.?
I was curious to learn the similarities and differences in the practice of Theravada Buddhism in that country by directly observing the Thai Buddhist ritualistic conduct of Katina Pooja. I reached remote Ashokarama, which I selected browsing through the internet. Thai conventional performance carried out at this sub-urban temple reminded me of my hometown temples. The general set up and layout were very much similar to ours.?
Thai Buddhists, just like us, consider ?Katina? ? ?Cheevara Pooja? as the most noble and meritorious ritual or sacred wholesome act one could perform; they too think it is just one among Ata Kusal, the Great Eight Merits, as per the deliverance by the Chief Priest in his sermon.?
?
Vap symbolizes the end of Vas season, or the rainy period?s retreat for monks
?
Very few spoke English where the Buddhist population accounted for 93 per cent of the county?s population. I was fortunate, that a young Samanera could converse in English reasonably well who roughly translated the main points of the sermon for me. The gender ratio among the devotees really shocked me: unlike back home an equal number of male devotees were seen participating along with their female counterparts; a significant difference compared to our very high Upasika involvement: in Thailand one can witness a fifty-fifty male and female participation. I observed a similar set of rituals being performed as we do here in Sri? Lanka. Unlike in the Bangkok city?s centerpiece attraction known as golden temples, which even charge visitors an entrance fee, the rest of the temples in the outskirts of the city were quite similar to the Sri Lankan set up in both the practice of traditional rituals and also in lay-priest relations.?
Thai Theravada scholars Ajahn Sujato and Dr. Mettanando Bhikkhu believe the so-called ?Garudhammas,? the eight rules that constraint Buddhist nuns [Bikkhunis], was an introduction by male chauvinists long after the Buddha. They both agree in their writings that it was the work of prejudiced and anti-women participants at the councils held after the Buddha. They vehemently reject the rule as more Jainist than Buddhist which says, ?A Bhikkhuni, irrespective of her seniority, must bow down to every novice male monk.??
?
SIGNIFICANCE OF VAP FULL MOON
The kings in ancient Ceylon, after offering Katina Cheevara, participated in the Vap Magul ceremony to promote agriculture. As Mahavamsa specifically mentions, King Parakramabahu had offered over eighty Katinas before participating in the ?plough and sow? ritual which commenced concurrently. The Maitriya Bodhisatva, a future Buddha, became a devotee of the Buddha with a large following of entourage of over 500 on a Vap Poya Day.?
Tavatimsa celestial plane was visited by the Buddha on a Vap Full Moon Poya Day where he preached ?Abidhamma? to Devas, which included ?Matru Deva? or his Mother Deity, Queen Mahamaya. She attained ?Sotapanna? status and as per the chronicle, another 80 million Devas attained various phases of sainthood. Vap Poya is of great significance for yet another reason, as Buddhist history reveals an important landmark; it was on this day that on termination of his retreat Buddha moved down to the city gate of Sankassapura.?
King Devanampiyatissa initiated the arrival of Sanghamitta Theri on Vap Poya Day, which paved the way for Emperor Asoka, his friend, to dispatch his daughter Sanghamitta Theri to set up the Bhikkhuni order in Sri Lanka.?
?
?
WHEN VAP MOON SPLASHED ITS SILVER GLOW ONTO GOSINGA SALA GARDENS
As the sun departed, the Vap Full Moon rose calmly, bathing and illuminating the whole Gosinga Sala Gardens with its brilliant sylvan glow on this exceptional evening. As if it were mainly laid up for the leisure of Arhants, the orchard was comforting to the mind. Among the other illustrious Arhants who were residing there were Elder Moggallana, Elder Anuruddha and Elder Revatha. Soon they were moving in to the garden where Arhant Kassapa and Arhant Sariputta were engaged in Dhamma discourse. Rev. Ananda too was interested to link with them seeing this splendid group of Arahants. Sariputta Thera addressed them;??
?Precious colleagues, your presence tonight I am sincerely grateful for. As the charming fragrance of Sala florets in full blossom is blending in stirring air and disperse in all directions, may I ask from each one of you as to what type of a Bhikkhu, in your analysis, will contribute extra beauty and decor to the grandeur of this elegant garden or add to this beautiful garden? Venerable Ananda, you may respond now, you are the close confidante of the Buddha. While Elder Sariputta unwearyingly listened, one by one they affirmed their views on the kind of Bhikkhu who could make the orchard more striking. At the conclusion of the round, Elder Maha Moggallana bowed to Arhant Sariputta and spoke to him, dear Sariputta, this serene night is lovely to watch; all have responded, now we would be happy to ask your views too.??
?O acquaintances, suppose a Bhikkhu is able to live his day enjoying the bliss of whatever achievement that is his preference for that time of the day, and with his mind wholly well under his control, I consider it is this type of Bhikkhu who can add extra beauty and d?cor to the grandeur of this elegant garden???
?
STOP THIS EXTRAVAGANZA IN THE NAME OF BUDDHA
Vap Full Moon Poya is significant to Sri Lankan Buddhists due to some special events taking place on this day. It symbolizes the end of Vas season, or the rainy period?s retreat for monks. It is also useful that we reflect upon recently added wasteful extravaganza to Katina pageants making it an extremely costly event. As Venerable Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera once stated, some temples spend a few millions in organizing a grand Perahera wasting lot of funds that can be used to build a small house for a deserving Dayake. The chief priests and Dayake Sabhavas should give serious thought to the late prelate?s golden advice. Are those elephants, hired dancers, fireball acrobats and professional whip-crackers really necessary? It is high time the organisers rethink the inevitability of using them. Cannot the temple authorities go back to past performances and conduct them in a simpler manner. As per the writer?s nostalgic memory, in good old days there were flag and flower bearing devotees who walked in a single file headed by the Katina Cheevara carrying Chief Dayake and a few drummers, that made an ideal procession. Why hire pachyderms at Rs.100,000 each??
May the blessings of the Noble Triple Gem be with you!

Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran today announced the formation of a new political party, the Tamil People?s Alliance (TPA) and his departure from the TNA.
Making the announcement at the Tamil Peoples Council (TPC) meeting convened at the Nadaraja Parameswary Hall in Jaffna today, the former Justice said he would continue to be in politics as a member of the new party.
The Chief Minister earlier defined the TPC as a non-political entity stating that any politician could attend the council meetings irrespective of political differences.

Women in Theravada Buddhism and Vajrayana Buddhism
	
?
Society?s perception of women?s role in Asian countries is still totally different from the western countries. The existing perception is very much influential on the practitioners and their opportunity to practise Buddhism.? ?
Sri Lanka is one of the best examples of a Theravada Buddhist country. I would like to compare the Buddhist background for a woman in Sri Lanka with the status given for a woman in Vajrayana Buddhism.? ?
According to Buddhist scriptures the order of Bhikkunis was first created by the Buddha at the specific request of his foster mother Mahaprajapathi Gothami who became the first ordained Bhikkuni.? ?
The order of Bhikkuni was introduced to Sri Lanka in 3rd Century BC by Theri Sangamitta who was the daughter of Emperor Asoka about 2300 years ago. Bhikkhuni order then slowly moved east, from India through Sri Lanka, China, Burma, Thailand, Vietnam, Korea and Japan. And most recently, it has begun its move across the oceans to the western countries. With the fall of Anuradhapura to the Chola invaders in AD 1017, after another ten centuries the Bhikkhuni order disappeared and became non-operational.? ?
The Bhikkhu Order also disappeared in Sri Lanka and there appeared white clad Ganinnanse, who were leading a lay life. Recent history shows that about 200 years ago the Bhikkhu Order was resurrected in Sri Lanka by bringing ordination from Thailand and Burma. But the Bhikkhuni Order was not resurrected and remained lost in Sri Lanka until now.? Not only in Sri Lanka in some other Asian countries such as Thailand and Myanmar resistance to a revival of the Bhikkhuni Sangha is still strong. Theravada hierarchy in Sri Lanka is not ready to accept the ordination systems which are being practised in different Buddhist temples saying firmly that they have received Mahayana ordination. It is non argumentative that there was no Theravada or Mahayana during the time of Buddha and Buddha gave ordination to women by dual ordination which is what is being practised all over the world. Though an ideal Buddhist society consists of male and female monks and male and female lay people it has never been possible to receive the recognition and consent for the Bhikkhuni ordination in many Asian countries such as Thailand, Sri Lanka and Myanmar emphasizing on the loss of the lineage. And at the same time some of the Sangha in these countries are against the ordination of female monks and this has created a hostile environment where they face many difficulties and discriminations in surviving as Bhikkhunis. To survive as a Bhikkhuni, self-sustainability or external financial support have become essential in Sri Lanka.? ?
This is followed by the educational background, family background, as well as courage and determination of the Bhikkhuni herself.? ?
?
I argue that the traditional ordination was merely a custom which was introduced to encourage institutional stability. The Buddha preached only about the monastic life but had not detailed about the customs of ordination. This argument is not accepted and valid in Sri Lanka. So there are only two primary choices for Buddhist women in Sri Lanka either to live as a lay woman supporting the Bikkhus or to ordain as a ten preceptor (Dasa sil matha). In this social settlement the revival of the defunct Bhikkhuni order has become anathema to Sri Lanka.? ?
?
The Bhikkhu Order also disappeared in Sri Lanka and there appeared white clad Ganinnanse, who were leading a lay life. Recent history shows that about 200 years ago the Bhikkhu Order was resurrected in Sri Lanka by bringing ordination from Thailand and Burma. But the Bhikkhuni Order was not resurrected and remained lost in Sri Lanka until now.?
?
The doctrine of Vajrayana Buddhism held women in high esteem and the woman plays a special role in the recasting of women?s image in popular culture.?
The story of ?Tara? in Tibetan Buddhism is an ideal example to depict the importance given to the role of the woman in Buddhism. ?Tara? a female Bodhisattva in Vajrayana Buddhism descended into the world and was reborn as a princess. She used to do offerings to the Buddha and generate the altruistic attitude of Bodhicitta always. She was urged by the Bhikkhus to pray continually according to the teachings that she would change her form to that of a man.?
After several exchanges with the monks the princess announced that ? in this life there was no such distinction as male or female, neither of ?self- identity? or a ?person? nor any perception (of such) and therefore attachment to the ideas of ? male? or ?female? was quite worthless.?
She then became enlightened. ?Tara? is both mythic confirmation and value of women?s achievement in Buddhist practice.? ?Vajrayana Buddhism apart from other Buddhist traditions insists on its emphasis of the relationship between a notion of ultimate spiritual perfection known as Buddhahood and the feminine.?
It highlights its total devotion to the ?Thathagathagarbha? or Buddha nature which is the vehicle for universal salvation. According to Vajrayana Buddhism each individual has the potential of Buddhahood within his or her mind regardless of his or her gender.? ?
Tibetan Buddhism is replete with enlightenment of female figures. Princess Yeshe Dawa, who generated the great Bodhicitta, achieved the wisdom of the Dharmakaya and became ?Tara?, an enlightened being in female form. Another respected female religious practitioner was Jigmed Surenjav from Khovd Province. She is regarded as ?Green Tara?, a popular Bodhisattva associated with healing and protection who was one of twenty Taras in Tibetan Buddhism. Mother Tara Megjin Legzen was another Tara, who was recognized by a renowned Lama as an emanation of ?White Tara?.? ?
Many such examples of the feminine embodiment of wisdom exist in Buddhism and are a huge blow to the inherent gender bias attitude in Theravada Buddhism. ?Tara? is one such great example of a female Buddha who is being widely worshipped. ?Chullavagga? is one early Buddhist text of the ?Vinaya Pitaka? of the ?Pali Canon?, contains statements from Gautama Buddha, speaking of the fact that a woman can attain enlightenment but in ?Bahudhatuka ? Sutta? clearly states that there could never be a female Buddha. According to Theravada Buddhism, Bodhisattva can be a man, any animal or a serpent, but is never a woman. When the aspiration to Buddhahood has been made by a Buddha and confirms it, the particular living being would never be reborn as a female.? ?According to Theravada Buddhism being born as a female is due to bad karma.? ?
Tantra denotes esoteric traditions of Hinduism and Buddhism that developed together most likely in the middle of 1st millennium CE. Vajrayana, Mantra Yana, esoteric Buddhism and Tantric Buddhism refer to the various Buddhist traditions of Tantra. ?Vajrayogini? is a Tantric Buddhist female Buddha and a ?Dakini? which is a type of spirit in Vajrayana Buddhism appears in Buddhist refuge formula known as the ?Three roots?.
Her essence is ?Great Passion? which is free from selfishness and illusion. Her spirit works for the wellbeing of others and for the destruction of ego clinging. Vajrayogini provides the way to transform people with strong passion into enlightened virtues. ?Janana Dakini Simhamukha? is a higher meditation deity who is both wrathful and female and concerned as the wisdom goddess.?
She functions as a ?Yidam? or meditation deity who averts and repulses psychic attacks that may assault the practitioner. Tantric Buddhism embraces the relationship between a male divine principle and a female divine principle while Vajrayana Buddhism highlights its total devotion to the ?Thathagatahagarbha? or Buddha nature.?
The Vajrayana teachings practise gender equality or even prioritizes the status of women and also embrace every conceivable kind of lifestyle as a spiritual practice in itself.? ?
?
Tantra denotes esoteric traditions of Hinduism and Buddhism that developed together most likely in the middle of 1st millennium CE.
?
It is not that the Buddha inaugurated a campaign for the liberation of womanhood. But he did succeed in creating a minor stir against Brahman dogma and superstition. He condemned the caste structure dominated by the Brahman, excessive ritualism and sacrifice.?
He preached on salvation by one?s own effort, presupposes the spiritual equality of all beings, male and female.? The whole community of Buddhist women lost a great man who had courage and rebellious spirit to declare a way of life that placed woman on a level of near equality to man which is totally against the exclusive supremacy of the male.? ?

XINING: THE COOL CITY OF CHINA
	
?
More than 14 million local tourists have visited this area last year
	?
	Xining is a melting pot of nationalities and religions
	?
	This city is linked to Lhasa in Tibet
?
Xining is a famous city situated in the western part of China. It is the capital of Qinghai Province. It is located in the corner of Tibet and Qinghai Plateaus. The elevation is about 2200 metres above sea level. As a result it is blessed with a temperate climate right throughout the year and this city is known as the Cool City of China.? ?
In 2016, we have had the opportunity of visiting this city on the invitation of the Xining People?s Association for Friendship with Foreign countries. As we are aware China opened up its economy in 1978 and it paved way for the Eastern part of China to make a rapid economic development. But in an area as Xining of the Western part of China, economic development came at a slower pace.??
?
Under President Xi Jinping, the concept of ?One Belt and One Road? was promulgated and this is considered as a new interpretation of the old Silk Road. Under this new concept the western parts of China received much prominence and Xining was considered a vital link of this project.? ?
All the political economic, cultural centers and universities of Qinghai Province? are located around Xining. Though most of the areas of Qinghai Province in situated above 3000 metres above sea level, Xining is located only 2000 metres above sea level. This geographical factor too has contributed for the rapid economic expansion of Xining.
Xining is a melting pot of nationalities and religions. Buddhists, Muslims, Taoists and people from 35 different nationalities and ethnic groups live here in harmony. That is great example for our country to follow.? ?
Today it has become one of the most important economic centres of the country. If a visitor to this city, climbs the pearl TV tower situated at the heart of the city he could see the sky high buildings coming up all over. Presently a vast array of infrastructure facilities are added to this city by the authorities.??
This city is linked to Lhasa in Tibet, to Urumpi of Xinjing and Langzhou of Gangzu Province by expressways. In 2016, I visited this city from Langzhou by a high speed train. It took only one hour for this trip and I was told that the normal train takes more than four hours to cover the same distance, In the near future, this city will be linked to Changdu and Kunming by high speed trains, In 2014, a super new railway station was built in Xining spending 2.6 bn Yuan. This new station could handle a freight volume of 73 MT per year. Many railroads that lead to Central Asia and Europe fall through this city and it is destined to become one of the main train links in China.? ?
Most of the factories of this city have been modernized and use high technology for the last 10 years. Production of Lithium batteries is a very important industry in Xining. There is a worldwide demand in the motor car and Cell phone industries for these batteries. As we were told that expensive motor cars, such as BMW use these batteries. In addition to that this area is famous for solar power productions. Production of Tibet carpets is an ancient cottage industry. This too has been developed and it is advancing at a steady pace. The mild climate of the area is ideally suited for the raring of sheep. There is a ready made market for these carpets in USA, Germany and Australia. It brings sufficient foreign exchange for this area. During the last few years this area has been able to maintain a 10% annual growth in GDP compared to other parts of the country.? ?
?
?
The authorities of this area take a keen interest in maintaining the environment at a very high level. They have been able to minimize the air pollution to a very low level during the last few years. The vision of clean sky in 2016 was 60%. The authorities managed to increase it 83.5% by 2017. Big parks have been created through out the city. A big park has been created spanning two sides of one of the three rivers, running through the city. Walkways and trees cover a distance of 2.4 km. They have spent 300 mn Yuan for this project and Xining Government has a goal to make it a happy and loveable city. Xining city and its suburbs are full of tourist attractions. Among them Tar Monastery Dongguan Grand Mosque and Qinghai lake are foremost.? ?
The Monastery was built in 1500. It is one of the six major sanctuaries of the Gulung sect of Tibetan Buddhism. This monastery covers an area of more than 40 hectares. It has more than 9000 rooms. Grand Sutra Halls are laid out on a well conceived plan to perfectly hug the contours of a mountain forming a phenomenal combination of Han and Tibetan architecture. The Provincial Government has spent a colossal amount of money to keep the monastery in good shape. Today it has become one of the main attractions for local and foreign tourists.? ?
?
QINGHAI LAKE
This lake is situated in the Northeast Qinghai Province and its area is 4573 sq km. Its elevation is 3200 metres above the sea level and it is the largest land locked salt water lake in China. In the North Western part of the lake there is a bird island of 0.8 sq km and it is a reputed Bird Paradise, It is the habitat of more than 100,000 migratory birds including bold necked geese brown headed gulls, cormorants and ducks arriving from South East Asia, India, Pakistan and South China. It is a magnificent sight and many birds dwell permanently on this Island.? ?
More than 14 million local tourists have visited this area last year, but only 50,000 foreign tourists have visited in the corresponding period. This a fairly poor number and this could be increased with a good publicity drive. With the help of super fast trains, this number could be increased. Even now they have commenced building super fast railway lines connecting this city to Changdu and Kunming.?
The Governing body of this city, the foreign ministry and the Qinghai People?s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries do a Yeoman service to publicize this city in foreign countries. The annually held cool city Silk Road conference is a good example towards this end.? ?
