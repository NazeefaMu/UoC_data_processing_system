A resilient rice that withstands saline soil University of Wayamba goes a step forward with DNA tech
	
A research team comprising undergrads from University of Wayamba has started a project to recognize salt tolerant genes using rice cross.The long-term objective of the project is to compile all salt tolerant genes into a single line using a simple breeding technique. The project also targets developing a salt resistant variety of rice genes that can withstand saline soil.
Previously, with the assistance of National Science Foundation and International Rice Research Institute, Philippine, they were able to develop a cross between At354, a salt tolerant rice variety and Bg352, a salt susceptible rice variety. This helped to map several regions of the rice genome containing salt tolerant genes.
Now, National Research Council funds the project. This project is headed by Prof. Nisha Kottearachchi, Biotechnology Department, Faculty of Agriculture and Plant Management of University of Wayamba, together with the support of Dr. D.R Gimhani, Senior Lecturer of the Faculty of Agriculture and Plantation Management, University of Wayamba, Dr. Venura Herath, Senior Lecturer of Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya and Ms. Buddihini Abeynayake, the PhD student of the project.
The research team has already recognised the salinity tolerant genes. Prof. Kottearachchi commented about the further researches on this project as follows: At first, we crossed two rice varieties, At354, Bg352. Then we developed F5 generation of this cross by self-pollination. We analyzed F5 population using new DNA marker called SNP using Illumina Infinium rice 6K SNP chip sponsored by International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Philippines. From this investigation we were able to map tentative areas of the genome containing salinity tolerant genes. By now, under the funds of National Research Council, we were able to sequence whole genome of At354, a salinity resistant variety, and Bg352, a salinity susceptible variety using the technique called Next Generation Sequencing. Now, we are in the process of exploring salt tolerant alleles by annotating the DNA sequence corresponding to the previously mapped genomic areas using computer software tools.
This project will reveal novel information on the candidate genes of salt tolerance which would be useful to rice breeders in the Department of Agriculture, Sri Lanka and to the outside world to develop salt-tolerant resilient rice cultivars. This project improves the human and laboratory capacity in the area of plant molecular breeding which is an undeveloped area in Sri Lanka.

A tribute to a stoic nation 50  days  of madness
	
\
Reputation is for time; character is for eternity-
~J. B. Gough
It was indeed a fascinating period of time. The Executive branch of our Government ran amok; it did not understand the fundamentals of democracy, leave alone its nuanced constitutional interpretations. He did not bend the rules; he broke them.
On whose legal and constitutional instructions and guidance, one may never know. Yet, he did it, almost at the cost of the countrys precious democracy.
For fifty long days, before the countrys populace on whose tired and weary shoulders he ascended to power and before the world whose sympathy he needed most at this hour of crisis, he chose to play a very partisan game. Apparently, the survival of his beloved political party, Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), was uppermost in his limited scope of governance. Political priorities overshadowed the grim realities of the moment.
As Executive MR et al go into madness, Speaker, Supreme Court and the people remain calm
	Executive decision came into question
	Character of people deserves admiration and applause.
	No one enjoys eating humble pie. Yet Executive was forced to eat it
The Executive
When the Executive was expected to exercise his stupendous judgment on matters of governance-affairs, that judgment not only came into question, it was proven to be unequivocally deficient.
Irrational conduct of the Executive took the country by surprise; all the respect and honour one would bestow upon the office of Presidency was not to be; its glamour and lustre went, the holder of office became a laughing stock, not only in the social media, but it was even more evident among his own close supporters.
The social media went to town on him. The Smart Phone fraternity was busy, sending either on Whatsapp or Viber many a creative cartoon or musical clip that made the highest officeholder in the country a minion subjected to disparage and mockery.
A deplorable behaviour on the part of the Executive did not do justice to either the Legislature or the Judiciary, the other two pillars of our Government structure. But for 50 days the people had to suffer this pitiful melodrama of willful violation of our Constitution.
A great part of the electorate does not belong to these fringes. They inhabit in the middle; their allegiance is basically to the more sensible and conventional principles of democracy and fair-play
No one enjoys eating humble pie. Yet the Executive was forced to eat it, not at the behest of his conscience; he was compelled to do the right thing by the countrys Judiciary and the Speaker of the Legislature. All in all, the Executives dissemination and his crazy conduct, specifically in relation to the unconstitutional dissolution of Parliament of our Constitution without any due regards for due diligence for wise governance speaks volumes for the lack of understanding of the nuanced aspects of constitutional matters and challenges to democratic well-being of the country. Wisdom is not a talent one is born with; nor is it a product of association with those who are below ones grade in life and education. Wisdom is a human quality that is, as George Bernard Shaw remarked: We are made wise not by the recollection of our past, but by the responsibility for our future. The Executive seems to be bogged down in the past. His unwinnable battle to save the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) from extinction has taken priority surpassing the winnable wars against rampant corruption, nepotism and erratic exercise of powers to suppress and overturn the rightful dues from the ordinary men and women in the country. Wisdom has not dawned on the Executive and one cannot expect for such a miracle in the context of what occurred in the last fifty (50) days.
The Speaker and the Legislature
One conspicuous and hopeful side of the confusing drama that was played before our eyes during the last 50 days is the courageous and spirited part played by Karu Jayasuriya, the Speaker of the House of Parliament. He, in arguably the darkest days of our Parliamentary history, stood his ground and showed the entire world that the spirit of our constitution was indeed alive and pulsating without any breakage. Such courage is indeed rare and calls for praise and applause. The unruly bands of parliamentarians who claim to be loyal cohorts of the shameless Mahinda Rajapaksa went berserk; they resorted to the lowest of human behaviour and were successful in making Madvi Some and Choppe of a bygone era look like Mahatma Gandhi and Mother Theresa.
Armed with chili powder and water, they soiled and desecrated the floor of the House of the People, Parliament; knowing very well that they did not have the numbers to defeat the resolution which was before the Members, an utterly uncouth and despicable conduct as was displayed by petty thugs who were elected to Parliament, managed only to reaffirm the general opinion of the Mahinda Rajapaksa loyalists as puny representatives of a culture that was nurtured and nursed by the Rajapaksa family and their immediate bedfellows.
It was against such anarchical and pagan behaviour of the Mahinda Rajapaksa-supporters that Karu Jayasuriya made a gallant effort to uphold the fundamental values and ethos of a human fraternity which we call Parliament of Sri Lanka. However, he was not alone in his fight. The members of the United National Party (UNP) backed by the other members of the Opposition too exhibited some guts and poise in the face of these marauding armies of parliamentary hooligans unleashed by the Rajapaksa clan. Parliament used to be an educative institute which had within its hallowed walls some giants and luminaries who were role models for the younger generation of that era. We have bidden adieu to that domain some time ago. A new culture has replaced that particular powerful force of our society. Holding ones own stead, keeping calm at all times and delivering legal and constitutional deathblows to the opposition is indeed a very daring and fearless act. Karu Jayasuriya did just that.
The Supreme Court
The Supreme Court of the country is the last refuge for those who seek justice and the rule of law. It is the sacred institution in which many a gallant and heroic argument is made for and against ones position on any given supposition. During the years of the Rajapaksas, this institution came under severe criticism and disparage. Many a member of this ultimate arbiter of the law of the land is usually held in highest of esteem and honour. Considered to be in the elite of the countrys social pyramid, members of this small group of professional men of law, in the past have written and interpreted some complicated legal issues and passed judgments on them without any prejudice to the men and women whose arguments for and against a distinguished attorney would argue.
The infamous 50 days witnessed the splendour of our Supreme Court; its conduct and delivery of orders in each of the cases put before they represented a microcosm of an independent court of justice.
They justified their very presence in the Court with honour and admiration. Some wonder whether the Supreme Court during Rajapaksas would have been so impartial and just. But to pass judgment on the Supreme Court for a mundane writer would amount to questioning their intent more than the very substance of the issues involved. I would leave that to legal luminaries of a future time. Yet, one cannot disregard one reality: What was placed before the Supreme Court in the last few days of November 2018 was of great value in the legacy that each of the decisions would have left behind. Each and every member of that court would be remembered for the decision they made.
Legacy value of that decision would certainly have played an unambiguous part in their decisions. They certainly left a grand legacy of right against wrong; legal against illegal and constitutional against unconstitutional. As a matter of fact, the Supreme Court saved the day for democracy and its continued sustenance in Sri Lanka.
The infamous 50 days witnessed the splendour of our Supreme Court; its conduct and delivery of orders in each of the cases put before they represented a microcosm of an independent court of justice
The People
One cannot forget the role played by the people in Sri Lanka during these 50 days. Each party to the arguments for and against the Ranil Wickremesinghe-led Government has its fringe elements.
However, wrong their partys stand, these fringe groups would not desert their political allegiances. But a great part of the electorate does not belong to these fringes. They inhabit in the middle; their allegiance is basically to the more sensible and conventional principles of democracy and fair-play. Those people still chose to trek in the middle without reaching the threshold of the fringes. They were patient and thoroughly poised; their demeanour did not change and they lent their ears to everyone but made no comment or pass judgment. That is a mark of a mature nature of the character.
That character stood tall. That is the most remarkable feature in the midst of broken down Executive and the Rajapaksa-legacy. That character of our people deserves undiminished admiration and applause.

## Title: Be a wise consumer this festive season
## Section: News Features

Be a wise consumer this festive season
	
Consumers should be vigilant and smart while the trader should be fair and reasonable
The festive season has begun and the citizens are testing their buying power with regard to consumer items. Almost every citizen is a consumer and is in the clutches of the trader, industrialist and the regulators; like the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA). This authority is the most powerful institution. According to the definition of the CAA, the consumer is any actual or potential user of any goods or services made available for consideration by any trader or manufacturer (S75 of The Consumer Affairs Authority Act). This shows that almost every citizen is a consumer and needs protection of the State to guard him or herself against unfair trade actions which pose problems to life and property of consumers. This act ensures that consumers have adequate access to goods and aids them to seek redress against unfair trade practices (Section seven of the act No 2003).
With the new trends on digitalization, local and foreign platforms such as E-Bay, the use of credit cards, online banking and online purchases in the modern consumerism have become complicated with little checks and balances being made, to benefit the consumer. According to The UK and EU 40% of the consumers make online purchases and have storage facilities in stores in mega chains and outside. This happens at a time when Sri Lanka is lagging behind with few online groups such as Singer,Wow.lk, Ikman.lk and a few others. There are foreign platforms such as Ebey, Amerzon and Alibaba. Similar international platforms are thriving in Sri Lanka, even without payment platforms such as PayPal; which are commonly used in the West. The Sri Lankan consumer is internet literate with almost every citizen armed with a mobilephone with high density of internet penetration countrywide. It is surprisingly fast driven disproportionately to the economic developments!
If the consumer is sharp and careful, it is easy to beat the cost of living
Is the consumer powerful and a King
In other part of the world these facilities are available, but not in Sri Lanka. The CAA is bound to promote consumer organisations and the best practices for trade based on competition law and practices. In Sri Lanka, where the consumer is not organised as in other parts of the world, the citizen is helpless and exploited as stated by Kennedy in 1983. He said that the consumer includes us all and added that the largest economic group affecting and affected by almost all public and private economic decisions are the consumers and they are the only important group whose views are often not heard.
Junk food 
Sri Lanka is full of adulterated and poisonous food, vegetables, fruits, and other consumer items. These unhealthy food chains operate locally and have a foreign influence. Mega goods are adulterated hence the downgrading of food. Unhealthy food include international cola, chicken and junk foods which businesses are thriving worldwide. These foods contribute to terminal cancer and there is no proper control of the quality and price. People expect these consumer items to be monitored by the main regulator, the CAA. In the west businesses follow the best practices and they are regulated and supervised by (DTI) Department of Trade and Industry. This is done to protect the consumer and the trader. Poor and unhealthy food is circulating through 50,000 food outlets with little or no regulation from the part of the CAA. The absence of a proper network to monitor the consumer movement has added to the problem.CAA - the Main Regulator
It was established in place of the Fair Trading Consumer Act no. 1 of 1987 and Price Control Act 1 of 1987 to promote effective competition and to protect the consumer. The CAA has a blend of UK, Australian and Western modelled concepts and was created as a main regulator to regulate trade under S9 of the Act. The authority has the power to undertake studies, issue directions, restrict selling above market price, determine standards, inquire into complaints, enter into agreements, deal with offences such as refusal to sell, hoarding goods, investigations publication, prevent whats misleading and deceptive conduct apart from having many more powers. Due to the abolishing of price control under the Price Control Act, the new concept of price making was introduced with every trader being expected to exhibit the price tag and maintain standards of items sold (S29). It is left to the consumer to judge the effectiveness of the enforcement mechanism in maintaining the price and the standards of the consumer items. Whether the CAA is competent in beating the cost of living or if it is a toothless organisation, is a matter for the citizens to decide based on the performances of the organisation.Beating cost of living
The cost of living is a relative term which depends on conditions, environments and jurisdictions. Rarely the prices of consumer articles are reduced, but the salary and income increases from time to time. The price of rice or bread is not static, but the consumer is ready to adopt price fluctuations. In the west, a major portion of the salary or income is utilised for accommodation. The food items are generally affordable, which is not the case in Sri Lanka. In the UK, one could be comfortable living with the minimum wages and in addition there are Government subsidiaries offered where necessary.
In Sri Lanka, though salaries and incomes are limited for many, traditional food items such as jack-fruit, leaves and village-grown items (available in Polas AKA street markets in towns) assist consumers to make ends meet. If the consumer is sharp and careful, it is easy to beat the cost of living provided that the cost of a mobile phone, tuition fees and extravagance spending are restricted. In short, one should know (a) when to buy (b) where to buy, (c) how to buy and (c) what to buy. In England the apple at Selfridges  the most expensive food chain  could be purchased on the street market near the store for a lesser price. In Sri Lanka, street markets are plenty and food can be carefully purchased and stored to be used later. Consumers make the biggest blunders by eating out at food chains with unhealthy oily food and colas; inviting long-term diseases. Consumers should be trained to buy healthy food at identified outlets. It is an exercise one should practise. A civic duty
It is the duty of the state to look into the health conditions of the food in the interest of the citizen. Consumers shouldbe alert
Ideally, the CAA is expected to entertain complaints via the phone and the internet. Complaints can come from all over the country. This applies to all consumer items and to services as well. In other parts of the world the consumer is so well organised that the trader is under pressure and the control is with the consumer. The media plays a vital role in this matter. In the UK when a cola company used the water from Thames River, it is the media that came forward as in the Bopal case in India to expose unfair trade practices of multinational companies.
In Sri Lanka, the CAA is expected to organise a consumer federation to assist the consumer. It is the duty of the NGOs to take the mantel forward without wasting time on human rights situations in Sri Lanka; given that the island maintains the highest HR standards. It is time for the citizens to organise themselves to beat the cost of living and to lead a careful, systemic, planned and organised life with other fellow citizens. Be cautious
It is illegal to perform bogus sales and overprice consumer items especially during the festive season. Consumers have no right to demand price reductions, but they have the right to purchase quality and healthy goods. Citizens may complain to the 1919 services, CAA and the Board of Standards with regard to issues relating to the quality and the price of consumer items. A joint exercise should be launched by the CAA in organising the trader, manufacturer, industrialist and the citizen to work together. All parties should operate in a competitive but a friendly environment to beat the cost of living and to ensure that quality and healthy consumer items are available at a reasonable price.Way forwards
It is the right of the citizen and the duty of the State to ensure that the consumer should be able to purchase quality items at a reasonable price. It is the duty of the state to look into the health conditions of the food in the interest of the citizen. Consumers should be alert and the trader should be supervised by the main regulators in the presence of a powerful consumer movement assisted by the Media and the State regulators. This should be done in the interest of the helpless and needy consumers who are at the receiving end. Steps must be taken to avoid substandard goods being sold and discourage junk food from entering the market. Such foods expose the young generation to health risks. This generation is exposed to Obesity, Type 2 diabetes, dental decay, heart and all kinds diseases.
It is illegal to perform bogus sales and overprice consumer items especially during the festive season. Consumers have no right to demand price reductions, but they have the right to purchase quality andhealthy goods
The United Nations too have recognised the right to satisfaction and ensures the basic needs, safety, information, a chance to be heard, redress, consumer education and a healthy environment, as rights and requirements to be facilitated for the consumer/citizen by the State.
It is the duty and a statutory requirement of the main regulator, CAA, to organise consumer organisations and to work on a joint project with the consumer, state, trader, manufacturer and the citizen to have a fair and reasonable system of trade and business for a better life for the consumer. Consumers should be vigilant and smart while the trader should be fair and reasonable. The State should be efficient so as to ensure a better day for the consumer/citizen.(The writer is a a former Chairman of the Consumer Affairs Authority and can be reached on sarath7@hotmail.co.uk)

Constitution not for personal agendas: Hakeem
	
The country's Constitution is not a document to be used or abused according to the whims and fancies of three people - President Maithirpala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Opposition Leader Mahinda Rajapaksa, SLMC Leader Rauff Hakeem said yesterday.
He said this during an adjournment debate on the abolition of the Executive Presidency.
The Constitution is a sacrosanct document on which is based on the administration of the country and cannot be used or abused according to the whims and fancies of three people. President Sirisena does not want the Executive Presidency abolished as he wants to cling to this post again while Prime Minister Wickremesinghe wants it removed because he is not used to irrational campaigns when it comes to a presidential election and not used to the emotional aspects of an election. This is because he appeals to the intelligentsia of the country. Mr. Rajapaksa wants to grab power and getting into serious difficulties because those around him are misleading and pushing him into taking wrong decisions, Mr. Hakeem said.
He said other aspects of the Constitution should be looked into and suggested that the electoral system should be readdressed. We prefer the proportional representation system. We were seriously affected by the local government elections under the new mixed system.
Mr. Hakeem said the interim report of the steering committee of the Constitutional Assembly should be discussed in February next year. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Digibrush dominates digital retail industry with 3 Golds at SLT 01 Awards
	
In the past decade alone, numerous brands have taken steps towards digitalizing their marketing practices.Effectively achieving this however, requiresdefinitive expertise. Enter Digibrush, one of the fastest growing digital agencies in Sri Lanka. Established in 2009,and armed with the dedication to revolutionize the digital marketing sphere, Digibrush has grown into a powerhouse for digital solutions just a decade since inception.
Over the last year, Digibrush has bagged several global accolades, one of which when Union Bank PLC waslaudedfor the Best Facebook Campaign at theCMO Social Media and Digital Marketing Awards 2017at the CMO Asia Awards held in Singapore.
2018 saw even greater achievements, with the company establishing itsprowess by winning the coveted Best Fashion/Beauty Website at the Web Marketing Associations Web Awards 2018. The winning streak continued with Digibrush dominating the Digital Retail Segment at the recently concluded SLT 01 Awards. Digibrush brought home the Gold in several categories, including the Best Digital Media Agency  Retail Sector, Best Website Retail Sector, Best Digital Integrated Campaign  Retail Sector. Alongside these accolades, Digibrush also received the 1st and 2nd Runners-Upawards for Best Digital Media Agency  Media and Publishing Sector and the Best Website Manufacturing, Storage and Logistics Sector, respectively.
An initiative organized by Sri Lanka Telecom PLC, the SLT 01 Awards -this year held for the second time in Sri Lanka-is a program dedicated to the recognition of digital excellence. The Awards recognizesinstitutions, individuals, and brands for their achievements in leveraging digital technologies, and is judged by a panel of experts hailing from a range of varying professions and industries.
2018 has beenan amazing year for us at Digibrush, said Hisham Zulfiqar -CEO and Co-Founder of Digibrush- commenting on the companys achievements.Winning these 3 Gold Awards is a testament to the strength of our footholdin the digital sphere, especially in the retail industry. These achievements are the successes of the collectiveefforts of Digital Strategists, Art Directors, Data Scientists, PPC Specialists,and Designers and Developers, all working in harmony.
As a digital agency, we have always focused on delivering quality mobile-first content. Simply creating great-looking content does not suffice anymore. Every piece of content must be backed by effective distribution methods and optimized strategies in order to ensure maximum content penetration, he continued. We dont believe that one solution fits all. Rather, we specialize in design thinking, which focuses on the cognitive, strategic, and practical processes developed by design-oriented teams. This allows us to not only produce aesthetically-appealing solutions, but also to ensure that they are all functionally relevant.
Hisham also touched on the agencys other achievements and upcoming plans. The recent awards arent all we have achieved this year. Weve made other notable strides, like increasing our customers e-commerce revenue by 175% over the last 12 months,and I am thrilled to announce that over the next 18 months we will begin rolling out an extremely unique product. The newest solution will involve automationand -to a certain degree- Artificial Intelligence, and will create journey-based marketing solutions that will ensure that our clients reach their target audiences across multiple digital touch points. By automating certain processes, we are able to offer cost-effective solutions, scalable across a range of business platforms.
Ever since 2009, Digibrush has evolved into a multi-faceted and resourceful agency with a 40 member-strong team associated with numerous brands -both big and small- ranging from consumer electronics, retail and FMCG industries with the likes of EZY Corporation, Huawei Sri Lanka, McDonalds, Crocodile, Union Bank, Unilever and Dialog.

## Title: Disce Aut Discede Warning from Polonnaruwa Royal to Cinnamon Gardens or was it the Other way Around
## Section: Opinion

Disce Aut Discede Warning from Polonnaruwa Royal to Cinnamon Gardens or was it the Other way Around
	
The Latin phrase Learn or Depart is used as the motto of many educational institutions and schools around the globe, the first to exploit it being Kings School, Rochester, the second-oldest school in the world, established in 604 AD.
The Royal College, Colombo in Sri Lanka also uses the motto. The author and the date that the motto was adopted are unknown. Royalists in Colombo believed that the first mention of the adoption of the motto by their school was in the Colombo Academy days and during the tenure of Todd 18711878 who persistently warned his students that they should learn or depart.
President Sirisena on Sunday re-appointed as PM the same man he dismissed fifty days ago, ending a power crisis that paralised the nation.
It threw Sri Lanka into an unprecedented constitutional calamity, Ranil was sworn in at a closed-door ritual in the presidents office. The 69-year-old Royalist from Cinnamon gardens had declined to step aside since being discarded and replaced by strongman Rajapaksa  creating a situation with two men claiming the one powerful post but with no functioning government.Claiming that his dismissal was illegal, as observed by Parliament [strangely, not challenged in court] which voted against Rajapaksa six times, twice during disorderly sessions that exploded into MPs engaging in butter knives, Chillie powder free for all and with chairs flying over the well followed by brawls. Sirisena who refused to bow to demands as the nation drifted, declaring he would never re-appoint Wickremesinghe and ridiculing his former collaborator in November 2014 conspiracy as their association imploded.
Cinnamon Gardens was Kuumbi kele
Colombo served as a seaport for trade between Asia and the West as far back as the 5th century, while Arab traders settled near the port in the 8th century and, in early 16th, the Portuguese arrived, for the Dutch to take over in the mid-17th century, who grew cinnamon in the area now known as Cinnamon Gardens.
However, the abandoned Cinnamon estate during British rule, the present posh residential area of the elite became Kuumbi kele infested with snakes.
The British turned the town to a city and it was proclaimed the capital of Ceylon in 1815. Since then the aristocracy who occupied Northern territories of the city bordering the southern banks of Kelani gradually moved to Colpetty (Kollupitiya) and Cinnamon Gardens.
Not acquired with an aristocratic or elite background like most of the political leaders of past and present, Gamaralalage Maithripala Sirisena had been modest enough to openly declare his past proving his unwavering personality.
King Vijayabahu I, who conquered Chola invaders in the 11th century, re-united the country and made Polonnaruwa the capital of the Royal Kingdom of Polonnaruwa. Being the son of a peasant from Salpiti-korale who moved to Polonnaruwa under the visionary leader, DS Senanayakes colonization of agricultural land scheme became the sole saviour for the United National Party which did not possess a courageous leader who could face the invincible might of Rajapaksas autocratic regime. The five-time Prime Minister [appointed in 1993 to a vacant position; in 2001 securing 109 seats, highest in an election; in 2015 Jan. appointed with only 42 seats, the first blunder by Maithri; again in 2015 Aug. winning highest 106 seats at an election; 2018 re-appointed following second blunder by Maithri]
Ranil Wickremesinghe never achieved that crucial winning margin like JR, Dudley, Sirimavo, Premadasa, Chandrika, and Mahinda did. The bitterness between the two was highlighted on Sunday when Sirisena rebuked Ranil and his Royalist friends at length after the swearing-in.
After the cold reception, which Maithri undemocratically closed to the media, the reinstated PM thanked parliamentarians and those who campaigned to re-establish democracy.The first priority is to restore normality, as work we initiated had been brought to a standstill, he said in a brief address, before going to a mass rally next day that overflowed the Galle Face Green.
Mahausadha Pandit in Ummagga Jataka
In days gone by, a king named Vedeha was in power in Mithila. Even, as far back as many aeons ago, the Royal Court of the monarch had four stupid pandits a foursome named Senaka, Pukkusa, Kavinda, and Devinda, who gave him advice in matters of Good Governance, worldly, and spiritual, a practice continued to this day. The foursome had enjoyed the best of benefits in giving all types of D-ropes to the King until the arrival of Mahausadha Pandit, son of a peasant, and Bosat, meaning Buddha in one of his previous births according to Ummagga Jataka. This amazing piece of creative writing by ancient chroniclers of Pansiya panas jataka states how the foursome used the contemptuous remark Goviya-puthu in reference to Mahausadha; which reminds one of the famous social medias contemptuous reference to Maithripala Sirisena by using a diminutive nickname Gamarala, who acted King Vedeha a few weeks ago.
The young Turks in the UNP who are impatient for change must realize the damage caused to the grand old party by the Royals tie-coat group leader and his wheeler-dealing faction who committed the blunder of compelling Maithri to appoint Mahendran as governor to the Central Bank, before expressing all sorts of offensive and discourteous suggestions proposing their saviour a fateful end like Gaddafis of Libya. Sirisena -as reported in Daily Mirror [17/12]- stated he decided to re-appoint Ranil Wickremesinghe as the PM only because he treasured parliamentary traditions though he still remained firm in his position that Wickremesinghe should not be given the post again even if all 225 MPs wanted him.
Yet, I respect parliamentary traditions. I see this as upholding the moral character of a democracy,nobody can dictate to the President to appoint anyone as the Prime Minister. Even the judiciary cannot do it. It is at the sole discretion of the Executive President. He stated, but he was silent on his other assertion, I will never remain in this position if RW becomes the PM Sirisena conveniently left it out in his lengthy, somewhat confessionary statement.
The bitterness between the two was highlighted on Sunday when Sirisena rebuked Ranil and his Royalist friends at length after the swearing-in.
Maithri had no choice but,
But the truth is that he had no choice. Was it an attempt to cover up. He can take action against the PM if he is encouraging corruption; people dont expect to listen to excuses. He is the president of this country, head of the government, a capacity Ranil attempted to unscrupulously transfer to himself if not for SCs rejection. Maithri has the powers and authority over the cabinet; he must behave like a right-thinking strong leader, not an opportunist. We reproduce two pieces of advice given by Mahausadha to King Vedeha---
My lord ! when the married pair privately enjoys their love they say to each other,  You do not love me in the least; you love somebody else; When they thus speak falsely, and charge each other falsely, their mutual love increases. A love-hate relationship as in a triangle of a President and two PMs
The executive presidential system the JVP and many other parties believe do not suit a country like Sri Lanka, which enjoys a lively democracy under a Westminister form of government prior to 1978. The Executive Presidential system bestows unlimited power to one individual who could misuse this power, in putting the nation into jeopardy. There seems to be a consensus among all on the question of pruning down the enormous power the constitution gives the Executive President. This does not mean the constitution is in crisis, but, constitutional managers, the politicians have made it appear as if it is in crisis. Before 19 A the constitution enabled the Executive President to prorogue parliament after 12 months of its existence. Former President Chandrika Kumaratunga during 2001- 2004 UNP government invoked the constitution to prorogue parliament while a no-confidence motion had been handed over to the speaker of parliament. The move not unconstitutional, but was undemocratic and could be interpreted as an abuse of power.
It should be understood that the enactment of laws constitutional or otherwise is not to be confused with the rule of law and that having a constitution is not as easy as making it work. Over the past four decades, since the initiation of the open economic and constitutional reforms in 1978 for the current Constitution, enacted in 1978, the disparity between clauses, articles, words and deeds is even greater for a simple reason.
In Conclusion; is there a Way Out
Civilians, It is time to join hands irrespective of race, colour, language and religion. We must get together, work together, speak and work together and write together. Go to the people in villages, expose the criminal elements in politics, expose the lies of these criminals and those who support them, expose the danger of authoritarianism, train them to say no to politics, no to racism, no to divisions; bring back rule of the law, power back to people.
Revolutionise the political system, liberate the nation for the future generations; agitate for reforms, not by the thieves of Diyawanna, but by a council led by professionals, intellectuals and non-political civilian movements.

He proposed; the leader disposed of!
	

A Green party bigwig from the city recently called on a prominent party leader in the upcountry estate sector and invited him to throw in his lot with the Greens. By the way, the duo, classmates, are long-standing pals. 

Assured of a place in the top team, the estate sector politico readily agreed to join the Green-led front adding a new demand: that his son be provided with a slot on the national list of the Green-led front. 
The news about the agreement reached at this meeting soon reached the ear of the upcountry Mans arch-rival Diga who angrily warned the Green leader that his party with its six Diyawanna members would quit the Green-led front if they decided to have any truck with the upcountry Man or his party. 
A highly perturbed Green leader had later pulled up the partys city heavyweight for entering negotiations with the upcountry Mans party behind his back. It was yet another white elephant! 
A certain purohita planned to hold a grand tamasha to promote the countrys agricultural sector at a leading conference hall in Colombo. 
The purohita got adequate funds released for the grand event in the nick of time before the regime change. 
This two day-grand event, a fancy of the purohita, which had cost a whopping Rs. 120 million had brought no benefit whatsoever to the farming community, say the white-collar high-ups who had to organize it. 
It was just another white elephant like the building the Ministry took on rent, one of them quipped.

How parents handle adolescents
	
The term adolescent is defined as those falling in the age group between 10-19 years. In other words this is the period between child and adulthood. Worldwide this figure amounts to 1.2 billion (19% of the population). According to available data in Sri Lanka 19.7% of the total population in the island comprises those who belong to this age group.
The Adolescent population in Sri Lanka in numbers is estimated to be around 3 million during the next few decades. Adolescents are not a homogeneous group. Theirneeds vary with their sex, stage of development, life circumstances and socioeconomic conditions.
The Adolescent population in Sri Lanka in numbers is estimated to be around 3 million
	At the age of 15, Myelin has only deposited up to the mid brain
	At the age of 15 adolescents have emotions, but not the higher functions
They belong to a very special age group because they are not children; neither are they adults. It is a transforming stage where their physical, mental, social, hormornal behavioural and sexual changes are noticeably taking place. For this purpose we contacted Dr Heshani Karunathilake who is in-charge of adolescents and Youth Friendly Health Services At the Base Hospital, Panadura.
Development of the human brain
The development of the human brain commences from the back to the front. The process has much to do with Myelin, a chemical substance responsible for the brains maturity. At the age of 15, Myelin has only deposited up to the mid brain and it takes 24 years to complete the deposition of this substance in front part of the brain.
The Amygdela responsible for emotions and situated in the mid brain is developed at 15 years of age, but the front brain responsible for higher functions- such as planning, organizing, critical thinking, decision making- are fully myelinated at the age of 24. At the age of 15 adolescents have emotions, but not the higher functions. So they tend to act emotionally rather than think critically.
Handle them carefully
Most of the problems occur with those in this age group due to this reason. Actually its merely a problem of their age and we should not blame our children for indulging in immature things. As mature and experienced parents we must handle teenagers very carefully and guide them accordingly; when guidance is needed. Otherwise they would get information from their peers who are in the same position as they.
When we consider the needs of adolescents we have to improve the knowledge of nutrition and reproductive health etc. We should improve their practical and life-skills by creating a supportive environment. A secure home with a peaceful environment is important
Yowun Piyasa
In Government hospitals there is a special service offered under the supervision of the Family Health Bureau. It is initiated under the Adolescent and Youth Friendly Health Service and known as Yowun Piyasa. It mainly addresses the physical, mental, social, behavioural, sexual problems of Adolescents and youth. Counseling services under Adolescent and Youth Friendly Services (AYFHS) are free for anyone and their privacy and confidentiality are highly safeguarded. If the doctor-in-charge of AYFHS cant handle the problems at hand, these adolescents are referred to the relevant clinics for specialized care. As an example a girl with a teenage pregnancy would be referred to the VOG while a child with a psychiatric problem will be referred toa Psychiatrist.
Parents must listen
When we consider the needs of adolescents we have to improve the knowledge of nutrition and reproductive health etc. We should improve their practical and life-skills by creating a supportive environment. A secure home with a peaceful environment is important and parents must also lend an ear to their children patiently.
20% of deaths due to abortions
The main health problems of adolescents can be intentional and unintentional. This is where injuries are concerned. The declining age associated with menarche and the increased age when marriage takes place lead to the increased fertile period before marriage. In Sri Lanka the premarital sex rate is 2-3% in the 14-16 age group of females and 10-14% in males falling in the age group 14-16. Teenage pregnancies and unwanted pregnancies, which end up in abortions, are also a major problem. Twenty percent of the deaths among adolescents are due to abortions.
22% of schoolgirls are anaemic
Other adolescent health problems are sexual abuse /rape, drug addiction, smoking mental diseases and nutritional problems. In Sri Lanka 22% of school-going girls are anaemic while 2% are obese. AYFHS brings benefits for the individual adolescent. It also brings benefits economically by improving productivity, return on investments with regard to health costs and is also a human right. Obtaining these services is a must if the adolescent is to achieve the highest attainable kind of health.

A lion has been caught grinning from ear to ear before mating with a lioness in the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
The photos show the big cat in highly animated states of arousal; standing on its hind quarters, roaring and baring all its teeth as he prepares to mount the lioness.
'As soon as the female is ready to mate, she would raise her tail and provoke him by rubbing him or crawling at his feet. The male follows her impatiently, for the female leaves behind a strong odour.'
This was just the beginning of a session that could last up to five days; lions will mate up to 200 times and despite the act lasting just a few seconds, they will continue to mate after 20 minutes. (Daily Mail)

LeapFrog Investments,the leading Profit with Purpose investor,today announced a USD $12 million investment in Softlogic Life Insurance PLC, purchasing the shares of FMO, the Dutch development Bank.

We are excited about the next wave of growth for Softlogic Life and our ability to continue to accelerate our market-growth strategy in partnership with the LeapFrog team and the insurance and financial services expertise they bring to the table. We are deeply appreciative of FMOs partnership to build our Company to this strong position and are happy to have provided an excellent return on exiting their investment. said Ashok Pathirage, Chairman Softlogic group.

## Title: Mamata Banerjee and Indias open race for opposition PM slot

Mamata Banerjee and Indias open race for opposition PM slot
	
When Sri Lanka became one of the most contentious topics in Indian politics during the second term of the Manmohan Singh-government, a whole host of politicians led by late Jayalalithaa took the Congress government to task. The charge was that the centre was mollycoddling the Sri Lankan government without punishing it for the war against the Tamils.
Despite its support for the US sponsored resolution against Sri Lanka at the UNHRC in 2009, the Manmohan Singh-government came under enormous pressure, post-resolution, to act on Sri Lanka by taking more stringent measures against the island nation. The Congress governments continual refusal to give into Tamil Nadu became a key contributory factor of its defeat at the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and the return of the BJP with powerful Narendra Modi as the new Prime Minister. In the five years that spanned during the end of Sri Lankas war in 2009, and the defeat of the Manmohan Sigh-government in 2004, there was hardly anyone outside the congress to defend Sri Lanka.
The lone voice in support of Sri Lanka or rather the Sinhalese came from Mamata Banerjee, the powerful Chief Minister of West Bengal. She went on to declare that Sinhalese are the brothers and sisters of Bengal and Sri Lankas war was an inevitability given the degree of LTTE violence. Last year when the visiting Sri Lankan cricket team wore masks during the matches in New Delhi, due to high levels of air pollution, Banerjee observed that the BJP government should be ashamed that it had left no choice for Sri Lankan team other than to wear masks due to poor air quality control in the capital.
That Mamata Banerjee has a soft corner for Sri Lanka, despite not maintaining any links with Sri Lankan politicians, is a fact. The West Bengal Chief Minister had never tried to hide this fact though she does not make a show of her feelings for the Sri Lankan brethren often. 
The 63-year-old self-made politician, Banerjee is often seen as a female version of Narendra Modi and has been named one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World by Time Magazine. Having joined politics at the age of 15 with the Congress party, Banerjee after a long stint broke away from Congress and founded All India Trinamool Congress in 1998. Today with 34 seats, Trinamool Congress is the fourth largest party in Lok Sabha. An educated woman with a degree in history and Masters degree from Kolkata (formerly known as Calcutta) University, Mamata Bannerjee who is known for her simple life style, has of late been waging a virtual war against the BJP, especially its President Amit Shah. 
When the Congress party was down in dumps it expressed its willingness to accommodate a regional party leader as the Prime Ministerial candidate, in a joint opposition alliance, at the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Leading a state of nearly 100 million people and known for her strong political integrity Mamata Banerjee was then seen as a potential candidate for this slot. Several other regional leaders like former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu are also known for nursing ambitions for the same. Banerjee, despite her political ambitions, has been playing it safe. Last August when media queried about the possibility of her becoming the PM candidate of the opposition, she replied that it was too premature to comment on the topic. Later it was agreed by the Congress and its regional allies that they should go for 2019 polls without naming a PM candidate and decide on post post-polls.
However with the thumping victory of the Congress party at the recent assembly polls saw an overhaul of the political dynamics. Rahul Gandhi is now being touted as opposition PM candidate by some in breach of the agreement. When MK Stalin, a few days ago declared that the Congress President should be the PM candidate several regional parties, especially those with PM aspirants protested. There is a broad agreement among all Opposition parties that the issue of PM will be decided after the poll, media quoted Rajya Sabha floor leader of Banerjees Trinamool Congress as saying. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) too had made a similar statement while Chandrababu Naidus Telugu Desam Party (TDP) has maintained though it too falls in line it considers Rahul Gandhi as a prime contender. However, Congress party is unlikely to declare Rahul Gandhi as PM candidate before polls, as it is banking on the regional parties to topple the Modi-government.

MR still SLFP patron, member: Aluthgamage
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was still a patron and a member of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and therefore, there was no obstacle for him to be appointed as the Opposition Leader, MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage said today.
He said all SLFP MPs, who backed SLPP including Mr Rajapaksa continued to pay their membership fee to the SLFP and that they had not withdrawn from that party. Neither have we withdrawn from the SLFP nor were we expelled from it. All of us, including Mr Rajapaksa, still pay the membership fee to the SLFP.
Last month Rs.3,000 had been deducted from Mr Rajapaksas salary to the account of SLFP as membership fees, he told a news briefing. Mr Aluthgamage said MPs R. Sampanthan, Lakshman Kiriella and Rauff Hakeem had opposed the appointment of Mr Rajapaksa as the Opposition Leader because Mr Rajapaksa would thwart UNPs attempts of bringing in acts and laws which were detrimental to the country.
When questioned about Mr Rajapaksa obtaining the membership of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) on November 11 at his Wijerama Residence at a grand function, MP Aluthgamage said a statement would be issued by SLPP General Secretary in this regard.
All I can say is that Mr Rajapaksa is still a member of the SLFP. SLPP General Secretary will comment whether Mr Rajapaksa had obtained SLPP membership or not. Yes, there were media reports which said Mr Rajapaksa obtained SLPP membership back then but then again the reports can be interpreted in many ways, he said.
When asked about the tweets by MP Namal Rajapaksa on November 10 and 11 which said he was joining the SLPP effective immediately and also included a photo which showed an SLPP membership card, the MP said he saw the tweets but it was up to the SLPP General Secretary to make a comment.
Meanwhile, MP John Seneviratne said Mr Rajapaksa was a legal member of the SLFP though he might have accepted the membership of the SLPP. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

The United States has accused Russia of flouting the nuclear pact, allegations Moscow denies, and has threatened to pull out. Other countries are able to develop missiles banned under the treaty because they are not signatories.

## Title: One tweet to break an impasse!

One tweet to break an impasse!
	
Last Sunday morning, as I was preparing to report on the swearing in of Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister, I received a message that said that media would not be allowed to cover the ceremony. It was in fact, a very apt ending to the impasse that began on October 26 evening. Then too my first indication that something was amiss came via a Whatsapp message. 
When media were prevented from attending the swearing in ceremony, the first confirmation that it had taken place came from the Twitter account of UNP MP Dr. Harsha de Silva. He tweeted a picture of the swearing in. Leaving aside the petulant politics of barring the media from the ceremony, the tweet was the perfect finale for the political turbulence. Social media was an inalienable part of the political drama. Whereas five years back, the audience relied heavily on electronic media, now it got a ring side view through social media. 
Two days before the swearing in, parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa had used the same platform to confirm rumours that his father Mahinda Rajapaksa was going to resign from the disputed PM post. 
As the tweets rolled in and the main media contingent was left in the sun outside the Secretariat some of the members used Facebook live to stream scenes from outside. Whatsapp groups buzzed with rumour as the country waited and held its breath
Dr. de Silva and fellow parliamentarian Mano Ganeshan both used Tweets to show that Wickremesinghe and Co were waiting at the Presidential Secretariat for President MaithripalaSirisenas arrival. It was a blow by blow, filled with all the tension. As the tweets rolled in and the main media contingent was left in the sun outside the Secretariat some of the members used Facebook live to stream scenes from outside. Whatsapp groups buzzed with rumour as the country waited and held its breath. 
While Sri Lankas national electronic media has become more and more biased and unashamedly politicised in its coverage, social media has allowed for the balance. Ordinary citizens on social media have been equally scathing in their criticism of the once all-powerful networks. More importantly, social media makes it possible for news, information and rumour that would otherwise be held back to reach public domains. The audience does need to be a bit savvy to take in the information overload, but it can be done. 
Even President Sirisena used Facebook to stream the 45-minute scathing speech he made to the UNP group after the swearing-in ceremony. As the speech that was aired several hours after the ceremony, progressed, the reactions of the audience onsite as well as online showed the additional layer of live interaction that social media brings in. Some sense of how the UNP top rung and the nation at large reacted to the speech was clear as it was streamed. 
When the impasse began, there were strong fears that social media would be shutdown. The weekend after October 26 rumours intensified that a very high ranking elected official was strongly in favour of a shutdown. That was when at least one gossip site carried the story. However, it never came to be and social media became a vital information channel for citizens expressing their disgust, jubilation and party affiliations in equal measure along with much more politically slanted content and news. 
MPs Ganeshan and de Silva would have no platform to tell hundreds of thousands of their wait for the swearing in. Even President Sirisena would have to seek airtime from national television to air his speech, 45 minutes at that
What would be interesting is to contemplate a scenario where a shutdown was in effect. Think of a Sunday without Facebook, without Twitter and the media locked out of the ceremony. Let alone the multiple flies on the wall viewpoints, anyone outside the Presidential Secretariat or not connected to the higher political networks, would not know a thing about what was going on. 
MPs Ganeshan and de Silva would have no platform to tell hundreds of thousands of their wait for the swearing in. Even President Sirisena would have to seek airtime from national television to air his speech, 45 minutes at that. 
Correction: On the extent of Twitter and Facebook impressions of hashtags (#LetMeVote, #RiseUpSL, #CoupLK) associated with the political turbulence in Sri Lanka quoted in the last column, ongoing research shows it to be much higher than what was quoted.

Phethai cyclonic storm: Rs.20mn from airlines using SL airspace
	
Sri Lanka will receive more than Rs.20 million in revenue from foreign airlines for using Sri Lankas airspace because of the cyclonic storm Phethai, which is affecting Southern India, Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) head of air navigation service, Mahinda Mahamittawa said.
He said international airlines and private jets had used the Sri Lankan airspace on some 380 occasions on Sunday and Monday.
There are more than 20 routes inside Sri Lankan airspace which are used by international airlines private jets and a number of domestic routes connecting destinations within Sri Lanka, Mr Mahamittawa said.
He said due to the cyclonic storm, about 220 flights had crossed the Sri Lankan airspace on Sunday and 160 flights had crossed on Monday.
The charges are calculated considering the weight of the aircraft which fly via Sri Lanka's airspace, he said. (Indika Sri Aravinda)

PEACE AND GOODWILL are what the Season of Christmas is all about, but sadly while people the world over are preparing for Christmas, our politicians are dishing out ill will with the unchanged political climate and the state of the country in PIECES NOT PEACE!!! THE ALL IMPORTANT DECISIONS THAT HAVE TO BE TAKEN ARE POSTPONED AND POSTPONED OVER AND OVER AGAIN, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO RESPECT FOR THE SANCTITY OF ANY RELIGION, ALL THAT MATTERS IS THEMSELVES; THAT THE DECISIONS THEY MAKE MUST BE ATTENDED TO FIRST REGARDLESS OF THE FACT THAT THEY ARE EMPTY AND HOLD NO SUBSTANCE!!!
Out of touch with common man
Ranil is being crucified for having shares in a PLC Company; are the people of this country really expected to believe that NONE of the other Ministers has SHARES in other companies If the finger is being pointed at Ranil, then look all around, see what the others have that they have not declared, they would surely surprise you!!! Why do they always look for the speck in anothers eye, neglecting the plank in their own Sadly, it is true that Ranil is totally out of touch with the Common Man finds it difficult to identify with the people of this country and their needs; he is incapable of addressing them!!! When the Pohottuwa won, what did Ranil promise the poor man, WIFI, DENIMS INSTEAD OF SPAN CLOTHS, BRACELETS FOR THE YOUNG MEN, showing total disregard for their basic necessities!!!

The village school
Although it is the season of goodwill and giving; besides the people in town being dissatisfied there is something akin to desperation in some of our remote villages and the appalling conditions they live in!!! Apparently, in quite a few of these remote areas beyond Ratnapura and Badulla the schools are hardly enough to house the number of children; the absolutely basic necessity of toilet facilities are most often not available, in some schools, girls and boys have to use the same toilet and more often than not the toilets are not equipped with water!!! What do the people in these abysmal conditions need WIFI for Has the Minister of Education ever visited these areas, shown the slightest interest in what needs to be done Some of the roads in Colombo are made, broken and made again, who looks into or cares about the roads in our remote village areas In most of those areas, THERE ARE NO ROADS, the villagers and school children have to swing, at the risk of their lives on ropes or wires from one bank to the other if they have to cross a river!!! Has any Minister or even the MP of the area ever visited or done anything about this terrible death-defying manner in which some people of our country have to risk their lives on a daily basis, for the simple reason that they have no roads Some of the important schools in Colombo have it all, gyms, playgrounds, auditoriums, badminton courts, tennis courts; a poor school in a village area does not even have basic water facilities!!! These are the MORONS WE BROUGHT INTO POWER!!!
School in the jungle
We have learned that in a far-off school in the Polonnaruwa area, where they are desperately poor, the school had requested Rs. 500,000 for urgent repairs and maintenance; this was turned down by the President and he spent Rs. 600,000 instead, on the Rajasingha Maha Vidyalaya!!! In the extremely poor area, the children and their parents have to light ALI VEDI to frighten the elephants away every day so the kids could go to school!!! What an absolutely frightening spectacle the poor children have to contend with every day, yet because they are eager to learn they do contend with it, the brave tykes that they are!!! It would be something worth looking at if even one of our illustrious Ministers or MPs braved what these little kids go through!!! Their bodyguards would probably be the ones who fall prey to the wandering beasts!!!
Basic ingratitude
The Supreme Court ruling came in and they still find it so difficult to accept what they cannot change!!! Everything they did was UNCONSTITUTIONAL and an unanimous decision of the Supreme Court said so, but they remain stubborn in their dogged determination to send Ranil home, beginning with the President, who claims he is not ready to work with Ranil at any cost  shouldnt Ranil be the one we are flogging for putting this man in the seat of power
Is he Maithri conveniently forgetting who put him there Basic ingratitude is what it can be called, but even that does not constitute such ruthless inhumane behaviour!!! In the face of such base ingratitude, Ranil was still gracious enough to say that he trusts the President will respect the judgment!!!
Failed miserably
According to a video which is going viral, we certainly dont have to thank the UNP for anything and least of all Ranil, for having got us into the mess we were in!!! Our thanks and gratitude should go to the Judiciary for upholding Democracy and the Rule of Law; this is what has given us hope for the country!!! The UNP by itself has nothing, absolutely nothing to crow about; they have not kept a single promise they made; they failed, failed miserably to deliver the promises they made in 2015!!! We, the people, certainly deserve better!!!
Do a stock-taking
We are waiting with bated breath for his Cabinet, perhaps the crooks in suits will again be appointed to positions of power!!! Ranil has to be careful, very careful about the Cabinet he appoints, the people can no longer be fooled and they are watching him!!! Notwithstanding Maithripala and the chaos he caused, the Cabinet must be changed drastically, take away all the crooks, the smiling faces who are so empty inside and replace them with men of steel, guts and backbone!!! The former Cabinet had very few of substance, take away all the unnecessary nonfunctional Ministries and keep to those which are absolutely necessary!!! What do we need such a huge Cabinet for, a Cabinet that is DELIVERING NOTHING What happened is a serious wake-up call for all our Politicians, they have to be big enough, honest and sincere enough to admit they failed and begin to put our country back on track!!! They have to sit down and take stock of what THEY HAVENT DONE AND WHAT THEY NEED TO DO, BEGINNING NOW!!! REMEMBER YOU WON NOTHING  JUSTICE PREVAILED, IF NOT YOU WOULD ALL BE HOME  DONT EVER FORGET THAT!!!

Prez should not use his power for personal benefit: Bimal
	
President Maithripala Sirisena should exercise Executive Powers, not for his own benefit, but for the benefit of the country, JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake said today.
He told Parliament that the President had claimed that he would not give Ministerial portfolios to the SLFPers, who crossed over to the Government but he offered portfolios to those who supported him.
"The President offered portfolios to those who supported to ensure his power irrespective of their party. But he is refusing to give portfolios when they are supporting another one's power," he said.
The MP said the President should exercise his Executive Powers not for his own benefit but for the benefit of the country.
Speaking during the second day of the adjournment debate on abolishing Executive Presidency, he said the Rajapaksa faction, which insulted and disgraced the Speaker was now admiring him when he accepted Mahinda Rajapaksa as Opposition Leader.
"Those who criticised and insulted Speaker Karu Jayasuriya should now apologize to him for doing so," he said.
He said the Executive Presidency was not answerable to the people and added that it had not only endangered democracy of the country but also democracy of political parties.
He said a Premiership answerable to the people and Parliament should be introduced in place of the destructive Executive Presidency.(Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Rs. 500 million- horse now runs faster for his master!
	

When political horse-trading was on top gear following the recent sudden regime change, a story began making rounds, that some Diyawanna members had demanded payoffs as high as Rs. 500 million to cross the floor. In fact, it came to light later that some political high-ups, who have directly involved in the shady deals themselves, had let the cat out of the bag. 

Meanwhile, some Diyawanna members from both sides of the divide had begun making discreet inquiries to find out the colleagues who had suddenly gone so expensive and a trail of tell-tale signs had led some of them to a big-mouthed member, who has made it to Diyawanna from a remote corner of the country. 
They also learnt that after some haggling he had expressed willingness to lower the price somewhat, but the deal had failed to click. So, this worthy remains in the same fold. 
However, what surprises those who discovered the true colours of this Diyawanna member is that he continues to appear on his partys political stage on a regular basis and directs fire at Pohottuwa without the least worry about the skeleton hidden in his cupboard. 
Party supporters greet him with loud cheers and whistles when he stands up to address them and his fiery speeches draw tumultuous applause from them. And these poor people are blissfully unaware that their hero is the main character behind the Rs. 500 million story!

Saga of how a high office went a-begging!
	

The origin of this story has been traced to a very high place in the country. 

According to the story, a well- known political heavyweight had given his solemn undertaking to accept the countrys Number Two office prior to Number One offering it to the former strongman. And that person had badly let down Number One at the eleventh hour. 
This heavyweight, a prominent front-liner of a main political party had even informed the Number One of the astrologically auspicious time he had chosen for swearing-in the new office. 
The arrangements relating to the swearing-in ceremony had been privy only to two of his family members other than the Number One. 
The Number One had all documents cut and dry for the swearing-in ceremony and was waiting for the heavyweights arrival when he learnt from a family source to his shock and dismay that the man had done the vanishing trick! By the way, this story had been confided in a prominent party leader when he called at a very high place for a decisive discussion. Now, everyone would be curious to know who that truant politico was. All we can say that he is a hard-working politico. If you cannot still make a guess, here is another clue: this worthy never utters a word about our perennial national issue!

Seven Indian trawlers released from SL custody
	
Seven Indian fishing trawlers held by the Sri Lanka Navy, while engaging in illegal fishing in Sri Lankan territorial waters, were released from Sri Lankan custody yesterday with the assistance of the Sri Lanka Coast Guard.
Navy said the released trawlers had been seized in 2015, 2016 and 2017 for trespassing on Sri Lankan territorial waters.
These trawlers were moored at the jetties of Trincomalee and Jaffna, and were repaired by a dedicated team of Indian engineers who recently arrived in Sri Lanka, before their release, the Navy said.
Accordingly, the Fast Attack Craft CG 402 of the Sri Lanka Coast Guard assisted the handing over of the seven trawlers to the Indian Coast Guard Ship Ameya at the IMBL north of Kankesanthurei last evening.

The advent of a common candidate in the offing
	

A well- known Buddhist monk is said to be busy these days canvassing support for political party leaders to embark on a Constitutional process leading to the dissolution of Diyawanna council.

Some political party leaders have reportedly expressed their willingness to support the move, but the second-line leaders of these parties suspect the real motive of this monk. 
The Green party bigwigs suspect that the monk is looking forward to an early dissolution with the idea of introducing a common candidate at the upcoming big poll as well. 
Some political party high-ups who are openly averse to the idea of a common candidate have begun giving him a wide berth, they say.

Tilting at windmills
	

This Diyawanna politico had expected to get a portfolio with the regime change. When he was overlooked, he did a somersault to the Green party.

He suffered defeat at the last general polls as a result of falling foul of the former strongman. However, a rival of his losing a court case paved the way for him to enter Diyawanna again. 
The man is said to be going around these days bragging that he has a plan to oust the Number One from the Blue party leadership. 
The politico has reportedly sounded some party seniors about his plan to bring about a change in the Blue party leadership, but the responses he has got so far are said to be either negative or lukewarm.
 
Meanwhile, some other Blue members whom he had approached had shut their door in his face, they say.

Making a statement in parliament, Sampanthan said the actions of the speaker could be understood to have lacked the conviction to remove him from the post of Opposition Leader.
He also said Rajapaksa who was appointedto the position was not even an MP at the date of such recognition, as he had left the SLFP to join the SLPP.
This would again suggest that your decision has been taken in haste and that your decision is in violation of our constitution," Sampanthansaid.

UNP in a dilemma over ministerial portfolios
	
The United National Party (UNP) is said to be facing a dilemma when it comes to preparing the list of Cabinet ministers because there are more aspirants than the number of slots available.
In the previous UNP-led national unity government, 32 of its members held Cabinet portfolios. However, the Cabinet has to now be restricted to 30 because it is no longer a unity government. Besides, the UNP leadership has decided to appoint MPs Ravi Karunanayake and Palitha Range Bandara as Cabinet ministers. They were not in the previous Cabinet.
Four members, who were ministers in the previous Cabinet, may have to stay away this time.
Party sources said MP Malik Samarawickrama, Mano Ganeshan and Rishad Bathiudeen have on their own offered not to take up Cabinet posts this time so that MPs Karunanayake and Range Bandara could be accommodated.
The list of the names will be sent for approval by President Maithripala Sirisena today as it could not be finalised yesterday.(Kelum Bandara)

We won't give Prez Ministries of Law & Order and Media: Akila
	
General Secretary of the UNP, former Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam yesterday said the UNF would, under no circumstances, give the Ministries of Law and Order and Media and Information to President Maithripala Sirisena.
He told the Daily Mirror that it was inevitable that there will be more constitutional and political dilemma if these two Ministries were given to the Executive President.
The President can hold only the Ministries of Defense and Mahaweli Development and Environment under the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. Therefore, we are not ready to give any other Ministry to President because it will create further problems, he added.
Mr. Kariyawasam flatly rejected the speculation floated in the media that the UNF was in a move to form a unity government and thereby increase the cabinet to more than 30. He said the UNF government was determined to establish a purely UNF government supported by other parties and restrict the cabinet to 30.
The list of cabinet members will be sent to President Sirisena this afternoon by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and I believe the cabinet would be able to take oaths tomorrow (19). But it is up to President Sirisena to decide when to appoint the cabinet, Mr. Kariyawasam said yesterday (Sandun A Jayasekera)
