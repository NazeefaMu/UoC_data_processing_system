Foreign affairs mandarins censured again!
	
The foreign Ministry mandarins have come under severe censure once again. Earlier, the second in command of yahapalanaya had pulled up the white collar ones for serious dereliction of duty, but they are yet to be up on their toes, they say.
It came to light the other day that the government nearly forfeited a massive US aid package due to the failure on the part of the Ministry officials to ink the renewal agreement on time. What was worse, they say, was that the mandarins were totally in the dark about the renewal being due until the UN envoy here reminded the second in command about it. On learning about the situation, the second in command had swung into action and got the foreign deputy to sign the renewal agreement.
The second in command has now decided to set up a separate foreign affairs bureau manned by white collar ones who can be depended on to carry out his instructions, they say.

A possible ugly scene in hospital averted
	
This Ministerial one raised to chief secretarial status in his party recently called on an indoor patient at a hospital in the city. Two other visitors too shortly appeared at the bedside of the patient. One of them was the former strongman and the other was a Betel leaf Western councillor, once a somebody now shorn of his plume.
The threesome dutifully made solicitous inquiries from the patient and then fell into small talk. The Western councillor suddenly confronted the Ministerial one with a bold accusation. You all gave us shabby treatmentwhat wrong have we done Is this what we are getting in return for the blood and sweat we have been shedding for the party
The Ministerial one, of course, had ready answers to the questions raised by the disgruntled local politico. But the former strongman intervened saying This is not the place to discuss our differences. He hurriedly took away the belligerent politico pre-empting a possible heated exchange that could lead to an ugly scene.

Ban on foreign jaunts; they mean business!
	
Yahapalanaya authorities are standing firm on the ban imposed on foreign jaunts for government Diyawanna members. Two high-ranking Ministerial ones and another two ordinary members from the Green party had recently sought permission from the new Big Boss to travel abroad.
The request by the two Ministerial ones had been turned down straight away. Of the two ordinary members, the one from the South who failed to get a portfolio despite topping the district preference list, got the nod for his foreign trip, they say. The disappointed Green party Diyawanna member hailing from the Colombo district was once as conspicuous in the media scene as his colleague who was lucky in this instance.

Demo in France by former detainees: TNA
	
The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) said today that last Friday's demonstration in France against a meeting between its MPs and Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO) provincial councillors, was carried out by some of those who had been harassed while being detained in TELO camps in the 1990s.
TNA MPs Selvam Adaikalanathan, A. K. Kodiswaran, Northern Provincial Councillor M.K. Sivajilingam and Eastern Provincial Councillor Kovinthan Karunakarum alias 'Jana' of TELO had attended the meeting held at a restaurant in La Chapelle, Paris.
However, a mob which gathered outside the restaurant had protested shouting slogans against the TELO members attending the meeting.
The protesters are said to be those who are alleged to have been harassed by the TELO and military personnel while being detained at TELO camps in Batticaloa in the 1990s. Their family members had also joined in the protest. They had displayed their outrage against Jana accusing him for what happened back then. The protesters had claimed they had to flee the country because of the harassment they had to undergo, TNA MP M. A. Sumanthiran said quoting Mr. Adaikalanathan.
Mr. Sumanthiran said someone had called the French police and the police had rushed to the location. However, the meeting was cancelled because of the tense situation and said he was not aware whether there would be a next meeting or when. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

This local politico presiding over the affairs of a township on the outskirts of the city is better known for his brawn than his brains. His younger sibling of the same calibre got involved in a clash recently and was arrested. Several politicos who were beholden to this worthy for his support at the recent general poll rushed to his rescue.
A Green party stalwart holding a key portfolio was among those who swung into action to get the chandi-malli released from Police custody.
The OIC, a straightforward man who could not be cowed by political influence refused to release the man. The Green party Ministerial one threatened and tongue-lashed him, but the officer stood his ground unafraid, they say.
Later the chandi-malli was produced before courts and was remanded.
The inquisitive ones now are eagerly waiting for the next move by the Ministerial one, who, they say, may not easily forget the slight he had to suffer.

Highly disturbed on hearing that Saji, the high flier now down and out, had vowed to spill the beans about the former strongman, several intimates called on the latter to get the story from the horses mouth. 
In reply to solicitous queries by his loyalists, the former strongman expressed his suspicion that there could be a hidden hand behind the  threat coming from his onetime lap dog. I am tempered enough to be able tell chalk from cheese. They want to make their political living off the supposed misdeeds of mine for the next five years. Therefore, there can be many such threats against me in store. I am ready to face them all
A mother-in-law whom Saji had introduced to the echelons of power and her doings hostile to the former strongman also figured in their discussion, they say.

This scion of the Dambulla political family of the 1956 origin was in hospital when Police arrested him in connection with a killing that had taken place way back in 1999.
A group of party colleagues visited him in hospital the other day and they were engrossed in small talk for some time. The Dambulla politico grew sentimental when their conversation turned to the topic of cut-throat politics among the party colleagues. With tears in his eyes he said: I had no involvement in this case. I have been framed. My rival in the district is the author of all my troubles. Whenever, our former boss visited Matale, he would make it a point to call on him as his lunch or dinner guest. He continued after a pause: Our former Boss sent 100 pirikara as offerings at a Sanghika Dana held at my rivals residence as a gesture of his goodwill. My father slaved for the party until his death. But our former Boss didnt send even a yard of fabric as an offering at the Pinkama held to mark his death anniversary
A call that came on his mobile interrupted his tale of woe. It was a call from the new Big Boss who is also the current party leader.
The new Boss had called the unhappy Dambulla politico to console him with some encouraging words, they say.

This better half of a former big-mouthed Ministerial one has been carrying on a mega business with virtual left-overs of an important material  to be more explicit -- cut-pieces of fabrics from garment factories.
She had secured the monopoly on the procurement of cut-pieces practically from all garment factories located in the free trade zones in the country.
However, her roaring business is about to grind to a halt following an order issued by a yahapalanaya Ministerial one to end her monopoly on the trade, they say.

He had thrown a tantrum when he was directed on arrival to a seat at the far end of the front row at the ceremony.
He summoned the officials responsible for organizing the event and gave them a tongue-lashing for the slight done to him. Do you expect me to sit at that far away corner I am leaving he railed at them.
The officials tendered their humble apologies and immediately arranged a seat for him close to the one reserved for the Big Boss.
The change made in seating had somewhat pacified the Ministerial one and he sat through the proceedings until the conclusion of the ceremony, they say.

The new traffic plan along Sri Jayewardenepura Road from parliament and Battaramulla towards Colombo and Maharagama on the High Level Road was successful though some snags along the Sri Jayewardenepura Road near Baseline Road have to be straightened out, Police said.

The DIG said they would have to discuss this matter and sort it out within the next few days.
The new traffic plan was introduced on Monday to be in effect from 7.30 a.m. to 8.45 a.m. to ease the traffic congestion in Colombo.

	Some people are of the opinion it is necessary to seek the truth in the aftermath of an armed conflict while others say one must look towards the future without solely engaging in finding out what happened in the past, he told a news conference.

	He said a mechanism to find the truth and bring about reconciliation would not be a straight forward process.

The Geneva resolution and the governments positive response to it is fast heating up the atmosphere at Diyawanna. The new Big Boss and the other top brass of the regime hailed the resolution as a great victory for the country.
However, a section of the Blue party is reportedly opposed to the partys official stand on the resolution. 
Meanwhile, some opposition elements maintain that it is unconstitutional to hold a domestic inquiry as proposed by the Geneva resolution without a mandate obtained for it at a referendum. Some opposition Diyawanna members have already vowed to oppose the proposal when it is placed before the House.
However, most Blue party members who are articulate against the Geneva resolution and the proposed domestic inquiry harbour fears in their heart of hearts that they would lose their Diyawanna seats for acting in defiance of the party line so some of them met a well-known constitutional expert to seek his advice.
They asked the expert: Can they take disciplinary action against us leading to the forfeiture of our seats if we vote against the proposal in the national interest
Courts in most similar cases have ruled in favour of the defiant members, said the expert giving the chapter and verse of a series of precedents.
The Diyawanna members were all smiles as they bid adieu to the legal expert, they say.

US trains SL Navy on underwater de-mining
	
	The US Navy recently concluded a two-week training session in Trincomalee to equip and support Sri Lankas underwater demining efforts.
	The US embassy in Colombo said that working with scan sonars and robots donated by the U.S. Navy, the Sri Lankan Navy enhanced its ability to search, locate, and provide information on any unknown items underwater, including unexploded ordnance from the conflict in Trincomalee Harbor.
	The United States is committed to aiding demining efforts across Sri Lanka, whether on land or at sea, said U.S. Ambassador Atul Keshap. By removing these remnants of war, we are helping ensure Sri Lankans can live and work more safely. This effort also increases the ability for the port of Trincomalee to expand its commercial operations.
	This recent exercise is part of continuing U.S. assistance for demining efforts across the country, totaling over $43 million since 1993. In his October 8 meeting with the Honorable D.M. Swaminathan, Minister of Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs, Ambassador Keshap announced an additional $1.745 million in support of demining activities in Sri Lanka.
	U.S. assistance to Sri Lankas demining efforts have also included the transfer of safety and field equipment, surveys on mine contamination for detection and land release, and mine-clearing operations. The United States is also leading efforts to boost Sri Lankas own demining capacity through training for mine disposal units in the Sri Lankan military, including the Mine Detection Dog and underwater demining programs.

Video: Will continue to eradicate drug trafficking: Ruwan
	
State Minister of Defence, Ruwan Wijewardene today said Sri Lanka would continue working with countries in the Indian Ocean Region and the Global Maritime Crimes Programme of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) to eradicate drug trafficking and maritime crimes from the region.
At a Colombo meeting organised by the UNODC and the Ministry of Defence and attended by Senior Drug Enforcement Officials of the Indian Ocean, the state minister said it was up to the countries in the region to ensure that a clear message goes to the traffickers that the Indian Ocean region would not tolerate their trade either on land or maritime routes.
Maritime crimes are common issues and therefore we need to find common solutions. The link between drug trafficking and other transnational criminal activities such as gun-running, money laundering, human trafficking and terrorism have compounded this problem. Not only we have to work together but we also have to find innovative ways of dealing with these issues, he said.
He said according to the UNODC, the quantity of heroin moved across see routes has increased by 200 to 400 per cent since 2009.
With that increase, even heroin dependency has increased among the population of East African and Indian Ocean transshipment population as traffickers have a knack of creating the local market, the state minister said and added that the Sri Lankan Customs, the Police Narcotic Bureau with the help of local intelligence agencies were continuing to seize narcotics smuggled into this country.
He said the political will extended by countries towards mitigating maritime crimes, was reflected by the participation of high-level delegations at the meeting.
It is essential for us to establish functional network of contacts, exchange intelligence, conduct joint operations via principals, introducing legislation and taking steps to get a uniform message across the region that drug trafficking will be dealt with effectively, he said.
Meanwhile, Navy Commander Ravindra Wijegunaratne said there were at least 45,000 drug addicts in the country and consume around 763 kgs of heroin a year.
He said according to reports, the total heroin smuggled into the country has been estimated at about 3,500 kg annually though however only about 10 per cent of the drugs that enter the country were being seized.
Sixty delegates at the level of heads or deputy heads of drug enforcement agencies from 21 countries in the Indian Ocean region and sever organizations attended the meeting. (Darshana Sanjeewa)WATCH
