CID to probe Avant Garde on money laundering
	
	Galle Magistrate Nilupuli Lankapura allowed a CID request today to conduct further investigations into the floating armoury in the Avant Garde ship at the Galle Harbour under the Money Laundering Act.
	The Avant Garde ship was seized by the Galle Harbour Police on January 18, this year and handed over to the CID for further investigations.
	Former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Additional Secretary Sujatha Damayanthi Wijeyaratne , former Navy Commander Somatilleka Dissanayake and two directors of the Avant Garde company had been named as suspects in the case and their passports were impounded.
	When the case was taken up before the Galle Chief Magistrate on August 27, the CID informed that the Attorney General had advised that adequate evidence was not available to file action under the Firearms Ordinance, Explosives Ordinance and the Prevention of Terrorism Act. Accordingly the magistrate withdrew the impounding of passports of the suspects.
	However the CID told court that they expected to file action under the Money Laundering Act and the Magistrate ordered the CID to submit the final report on the investigations today.
	The lawyers appearing for the Avant Garde company took up the position that in view of the Attorney Generals decision not to file action under the Prevention of Terrorism Act , the Firearms Ordinance and the Explosives Ordinance the case should not proceed. They told court that steps taken by the CID to file action under the Money Laundering Act was a shrewd tactic to proceed with the case. They said the propaganda given to the case by the media affected marine defence.
	The state counsel told court that the CID had to examine 35 bank accounts and therefore they needed ample time for it. He said no one had not been named as a suspect during investigations.
	The Magistrate held that the CID should be allowed the requested time for the ongoing investigations. She also ordered the Courts Registrar to inform the Ports Authority and the Southern Province Commander of the Navy to carry out the previous court order to allow the transfer of weapons to another ship.
	The case was postponed for February 25, 2016. (D.G.Sugathapala and Sumathipala Diayagahage)

No political prisoners in SL: Govt.
	
While reiterating that there are no political prisoners in Sri Lankas jails, the government today reassured that the issue of LTTE suspects incarcerated for alleged acts of terrorism would be addressed on a priority basis and those who have evidence of direct involvement of terrorist acts against them would be prosecuted as early as possible.
Cabinet spokesman and Minister Rajitha Senaratne told the weekly cabinet news briefing that President Maithripala Sirisena had instructed the relevant law enforcement authorities to accelerate the judicial process regarding the persons in remand custody as suspects on terrorist activities during and after the conflict.
He said the majority of some 12,000 LTTE carders who had surrendered to the government during the end of the conflict had been rehabilitated by the government except those who had been accused of terrorist activities.
Those who had been convicted and are under an ongoing judicial process and those who had been remanded as suspects are still detained. Considering the proposal made by Minister D.M. Swaminathan, the Cabinet has requested the Justice Minister to present the recommendation on accelerating the judicial procedures on these detainees to the Cabinet of Ministers.
The detainees are categorized broadly into three groups as those who are already convicted, those who had already been issued a charge sheet and pending trial or partially heard and those who had not been framed with any charge sheet and kept in the remand custody as suspects.
The cabinet gave the nod to a set of proposals presented by Minister Swaminathan that require the Justice Ministry, Law & Order and Prison Reforms Ministry and the Ministry of Defence to separately submit a list of persons who are presently in prison and in remand custody for various conflicts related offences. The list should provide the details of offences on a category-wise basis as set out in the memorandum. This may also identify minor offences including the reasons for detention.
The minister proposed to frame a guideline as to how amnesty or pardon would he granted for persons under the 3 categories by a team of officials drawn from relevant Ministries. This may also include granting of bail under certain circumstances.
In case where there is strong evidence and where the offender has committed major offences in the opinion of the Attorney-General, the legal proceedings and cases should be fast tracked within a short time frame.
He also proposed the consideration by the President to grant amnesty or pardon as a goodwill gesture and as part of the commitment to the t resolution and grant such amnesty during Christmas, New Year day and Thaipongal Day which falls on January 15, 2016 and to authorize the Ministry of Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs to formulate a scheme to provide State financial assistance through the relevant Divisional secretaries and other state agencies in order to extend support in livelihood, income generation, self-employment and settlement and re-integration activities.

Parliament sessions were suspended for a brief period due to a tense situation over a dispute that arose over a list of speakers of the debate on the UN Human Rights Commission report.
The situation arose when Opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa objected to the pattern to which the debate would be conducted where government MPs were given speeches instead of the common practice of shifting speeches from government and opposition MPs.
Then MP Dinesh Gunawardene joined in the cross talk. MP Mijibur Rahaman who was at the chair said he was following the list which was given to him.
It was revealed that Mr. Weerawansa's name was at the end of the list.
However, Mr. Rahaman had to adjourn the House for a brief period due to a tense situation that arose.
Later when the sessions resumed, Mr. Weerawansa was given the opportunity to speak.
Mr. Gunawardene who rose when the sessions began tendered an apology for preventing Minister Swaminathan was speaking. The objection was made by the opposition when the minister was given a speech. (YP)

Top CEB officials get lavish Rs.10m foreign training tour
	
	Controversy surrounds a lavish Rs.10.4 million foreign training tour, to be indulged in by 11 top level officials of the Ceylon Electricity Board, in Vienna, Austria in November this year, despite a recent government circular to minimise the use of state funds.
	The group, comprising seven CEB deputy general managers, three chief engineers and an accountant will participate in a six-day training workshop in Vienna from November 9 to 13.
	The workshop will be conducted on Certified Key Performance Indicator (KPI) for Professional and Practitioner for a fee of US$ 76,620 (Rs.10.4 million).
	CEB inside sources told Daily Mirror that this was an utter waste of state funds, as such a training course could easily be conducted in Sri Lanka for much less.
	It could even be arranged for a foreign instructor to conduct a workshop here for just US$ 100 per trainee, they said.
	Moreover, two or three of the officers are to retire at the beginning of 2016, and spending such a vast sum on training those who will retire in two months is appalling.
	The sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the CEB management had ignored government circular No. CSA/9/3/(i) issued by the Presidential Secretariat on October 1 (and based on a Cabinet decision of 16. 09. 2015) to minimise the use of state funds.
	Also, a letter from the secretary to the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy -- to the CEB and six other departments -- had referred to the Cabinet decision to reduce foreign trips and tours of state officials.
	Responding to the allegations, CEB General Manager M. C. Wickramasekara said that if staff training was deemed necessary by a selection committee, it had to be carried out regardless.
	The GM said any CEB union was welcome to sit down and discuss such matters with him. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

TULF not invited to all party meeting, Anandasangaree dismayed
	
The Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) leader V. Anandasangaree, in a letter addressed to President Maithripala Sirisena, has expressed his dismay over the exclusion of his party from an all party meeting.
President Sirisena had, in writing, invited 21 political parties registered in the country to discuss a domestic mechanism for inquiring into the alleged war crimes -- following last month's resolution at the UNHRC in Geneva. The meeting, which is scheduled to be held at 5.00 pm today, at the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo, had been convened in order to obtain suggestions from each political party regarding the proposed mechanism.
In the letter Mr. Anandasangari had said he was thoroughly disappointed with the principles adopted by the government when convening meetings of leaders of political parties.
I wish to point out a very serious omission your officials have made, certainly not intentionally, to bring to your notice that the TULF is not qualified to be invited to participate at the meeting of leaders of Political Parties Your Excellency has convened, for the 22nd of this month. Earlier reports in the media specifically said that the leaders of all registered Political Parties are being invited.
"The latest reports say that only leaders of Political Parties represented in Parliament are invited, he had said.
He had requested the President to adopt what he called a fair model in this regard. (KB)

Cabinet spokesman and Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne today said the recommendations of the Paranagama Commission report was more critical on Sri Lanka than the UNHRC report and added if it was published before the UNHRC report, the situation would have been more precarious for the country.
Responding to a journalist, Minister Senaratne said Sri Lanka had to go a long way to finalize the domestic mechanism as there was a large number of stakeholders to the problem.
"The process indeed is not an easy task because we have to put in place a mechanism acceptable locally and internationally while safeguarding our sovereignty, judicial independence and dignity of the country. That is why the government has given a two day debate in Parliament on the UNHRC report, Paranagama report and Udalagama report. President Maithripala Sirisena has called an all party confab to discuss the issue and reach a compromise. In addition, the government will talk to all those concerned on the matter before setting up the local mechanism that will probably need to introduce new legislation," he emphasized.
Commenting on the allegations made by the opposition during the ongoing two-day debate in Parliament, Minister Senaratne reiterated that the local mechanism for a credible inquiry on alleged war crimes would be held under the provisions of Sri Lankas basic law and within the judicial parameters comprising judges, prosecutors and defense counsel chosen by Sri Lanka.
But we have been given the opportunity to obtain expert opinion, advice and know-how from foreign experts who are knowledgeable and experienced in this kind of investigations. But it is definitely not that Sri Lanka is going to have a hybrid court for the purpose, he said and added foreign advice had been sought in the past in murder inquiries of Prime Minister S.W.R.D.Bandaranaike, Minister Lalith Athulathmudali and Major General Denzil Kobbekaduwa.
Even, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has obtained the services of a team of four foreign eminent persons headed by Sir Desmond De Silva to assist the Paranagama Commission in the recent past, he said.before the UNHRC report, the situation would have been more precarious for Sri Lanka.

	TNA MP Mavai Senathirajah said today that his party would be compelled to form a separate Tamil State with the help of the international community if any party resolved to form a Sinhala dominated state.
	He said so in Parliament in response to a comment by MP Wimal Weerawansa that people should come together to safeguard the Sinhala identity and the sovereignty of the state.
	Statements such as these will push the Tamils towards separatism, said Mr. Senathirajah.
	He said the TNA was not satisfied with the OHCHR resolution which came out recently.
	However his fellow party member MP M A. Sumanthiran said his party would help the government to work on the resolution. We will wait and see what the government does about it, he said. (Yohan Perera)
