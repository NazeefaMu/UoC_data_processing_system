Army Camps won't be removed immediately: PM in Jaffna
	
Camps of Security Forces in the North would not be removed immediately but would cease to exist automatically when the situation in the area improves gradually, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said on Sunday.
Mr Wickremesinghe said so at a ceremony held to give permanent appointment to voluntary teachers in the North at the Jaffna Hindu College last morning.
I read a report in a Sinhalese weekly which said Army camps in the North are to be closed down within the next few days. I asked the Army Commander about it and he said there was no such move.
Then I inquired whether the Northern Chief Minister whether he had ordered the forces to move out of North. He had not done so. These kinds of stories arouse communal hatred. It is not right for anyone to sabotage the reconciliation programme at a time it is progressing gradually, the Prime Minister said.
The Army Camps in the North will not be removed. However, they will cease to exist automatically, when the situation in the North improves gradually. There will not be any immediate removal, he added.(Yohan Perera)

Basic Income for  thriving cultural sector
	
Artist Paalitha Abeyratne receiving his award from the Coordinator for India Network for Basic Income (INBI) Dr Sarath Davala

In Sri Lanka, we have barely any state funding for artists and realistically speaking, the government doesnt sustain a model that would support developing creative practitioners. Yet we must ask Where is the next Chitrasena or the next Khemadasa Where is the next Jean Arasanayagam or Oosha Saravanamuttu Are they stacking shelves in a super market Are they working in a garment factories

Recently Basic Income Sri Lanka (BISL) held an awards ceremony at the OPA Auditorium for 5 recipients who were chosen to receive the award of Basic Income. The 5 recipients were chosen from vulnerable communities: 3 widows from the war affected areas of Kilinochchi and 2 artists who do voluntary work in the theatre in the South: Each recipient to receive an unconditional Basic Income of Rs 10,000 (World Bank poverty threshold of $2 a day) per month for a period of 2 years. They will become part of a study to experiment the effects of Basic Income on the degree of vulnerability in their lives. The event was organised by Selvi Sachithanandam, Coordinator BISL and Co-coordinators Visakha Tillekeratne and Madhuri Mody
It is very significant that voluntary artists were chosen as subjects of this study on par with war widows. The rationale behind this action is no doubt admirable
I have worked for 20 years now as a theatre practitioner and teacher, a creative and journalistic writer, as a radio personality and a voice over artist. My work has taken me around the country and led to encounters with people from all communities and social backgrounds. And if there is one thing I have learned, and one thing I have tried to change, it is the opinion that the arts are not considered a viable, valuable profession. In other words, most artistic people here and around the world, inevitably hear those dreaded words - get a real job  and in fact, I have lost count of the times I have been asked What is your real job
My response has always been I have a real job, thank you. I have business hours, budgets, company policies and action plans and I live in fear of my accountant just like everyone else.


"It is very significant that voluntary artists were chosen as subjects of this study on par with war widows"

Artistic and creative work has immense value socially and economically, but receives little recognition. It is employed in entertainment, education, communications and reconciliation, and yet skilled, creative people are constantly questioned as to the validity of their profession and asked to compromise on the value of their labour.
I am very aware that I speak from a position of privilege. I was born into a family committed to drama, music and arts education and I had all the support I needed to establish my career. This is not the case for the large majority of my fellow artists around the country, be they actors, writers, musicians, visual artists or dancers.
For working 8 to 10 hours a day, theatre actors  for instance - are lucky if they are paid Rs.750 and receive a free meal. Many artists are not paid at all. Very often, emerging and established creative people are asked to deliver work free of charge in exchange for exposure. And granted, exposure is a very worthwhile thing - but you cannot eat it. Any creative artist is first and foremost a human being. One entirely deserving of living life with dignity and self-respect, and these qualities are reinforced for us all in the ability to do certain basic things, like paying bills and putting food on the table.
Financial crisis is always the great motivator that leads to artists get real jobs. This means there is little or no time for creative work or for developing creative potential and vision. If we acknowledge that the arts contribute positively to an individuals emotional and social development, then we must also acknowledge that the inability to be creative, especially for an artist, can lead not only to the frustration of not being able to live up to ones potential, but also to a damaging social alienation. Perhaps, in a world that recognizes only certain forms of labour, and values punishment over compassion, this is not such a big deal. But I, and many likeminded people, do not look forward to a future where potentially brilliant creative artists have become cogs in a corporate machine or subsist on meagre wages. In Sri Lanka, we have barely any state funding for artists and realistically speaking, the government doesnt sustain a model that would support developing creative practitioners. Yet we must ask Where is the next Chitrasena or the next Khemadasa Where is the next Jean Arasanayagam or Oosha Saravanamuttu Are they stacking shelves in a super market Are they working in a garment factory
As we travel further into the 21st century and artists face increasingly unstable and unreliable incomes, we need to have a programme that addresses modern challenges. When the unique issues of the creative entrepreneur are considered, the adoption of a basic income model becomes, indeed, an idea whose time has come.

Artist Lihan Mendis receiving his award from the Coordinator for India Network for Basic Income (INBI) Dr Sarath Davala
Basic Income is not payment for artistic or creative work. It is recognition that artists are human and everyone needs financial security, no matter what kind of work they do. It is a small and unconditional cash flow specifically aimed at helping an artist meet their day-to-day needs. It will reduce financial dependency on other family members, enable the artist to have more time to be creative and alleviate feelings of stress and anxiety. It will reduce the pressure to find work that pays as opposed to work that is fulfilling. In this age where technology has advanced our means of communications infinitely, the scope for artists to make and distribute work that is deeply personal or has direct social impact has increased exponentially. A basic income would be a transformative policy shift that would not only grant stability and freedom from the income trap, but would lead to a thriving cultural sector.
Basic income would be a transformative policy shift that would not only grant stability and freedom from the income trap, but it would lead to a thriving cultural sector.
Basic Income Sri Lankas aim to empower artists does not mean that there will automatically be greater appreciation of artistic professions but it is a call to society in general to acknowledge that the definition of what constitutes a real job is a lot wider than the traditional models that dominate our culture.

"Basic Income is not payment for artistic or creative work. It is recognition "

I would like to quote from author Saul Bellow who made this statement on science and art at his Nobel Prize lecture in 1976: Only art penetrates what pride, passion, intelligence and habit erect on all sides  the seeming realities of this world. There is another reality, the genuine one, which we lose sight of. This other reality is always sending us hints, which without art, we cant receive. Proust calls these hints our true impressions. The true impressions, our persistent intuitions, will, without art, be hidden from us and we will be left with nothing but a terminology for practical ends which we falsely call life.
On behalf of Mind Adventure Group, I would like to thank Basic Income Sri Lanka for having taken the artists case out in the public domain and throwing a spot light on their predicament. We hope BISL will continue to engage with artists as they strive to give art and creativity the value and recognition they deserve and promote their social and personal benefits.

Bosom buddies who ate, drank together end up cuffed together
	
There were two bosom buddies who ate, drank and went on trips together. But sadly, they also got addicted to heroin together.
With the passage of time, some other drug addicts also joined them in the same way that garbage joins the garbage dump. These two buddies were residents of Talatuoya.
One of the friends was unlucky to be checked by a passing police petrol from the Talatuoya Police. He had 30 milligrammes of heroin on his person when he was checked and was taken into custody.
Machan, your bosom buddy has been arrested with heroin on him by the police", a mutual friend who witnessed the scene reported to the other member of the twosome.
If you are going to see him, take him his 'fix',the mutual acquaintance advised him.
He took the advice and went to see his 'buddy' taking with him 30 milligrammes of heroin to give him as a 'gift.'
Unfortunately, the police were one step ahead of them and nabbed him as well just as he was handing over the 'fix' to his buddy. (T.M. Sarath)

British MPs visit to SL during former regime: GL
	
In response to investigations against British MPs including Ian Paisley by the House of Commons over his visit to Sri Lanka during the former rule, then External Affairs Minister Prof.G.L. Peiris said today that the government of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had to invite such MPs to see for themselves the actual ground situation in the country.
Prof. Peiris said the then government did so to counter adverse propaganda being carried out by the pro-LTTE elements.
He said two important personages, British Foreign Secretary David Miliband and French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner, had asked President Rajapaksa to stop the war on terror, but the government resisted such pressure and concluded the war successfully.
However, Prof. Peiris, who is the Chairman of Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), said there were still formidable challenges for Sri Lanka in the international arena, even after the war was over.
The establishment of the Provisional Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam was cited by him as an example to this effect.
During the time of the referendum in Britain on the move to quit the European Union, he said the organization called 'Tamils for Conservatives wrote to the then British Prime Minister David Cameron pledging electoral support in that country, in return for his assistance for them to win over the rights of Tamils in Sri Lanka .
He said he strongly protested over the response of Mr. Cameron.
Tamil organizations were on a massive campaign to spread misinformation. We had to counter it, he said.
Against this backdrop, he said the government invited British MPs to see for themselves the ground situation here. He added that the British MP had been questioned not over his invitation to Sri Lanka, but over the failure to fulfil his reporting obligation.
Responding to UNP MPs questioning him over the invitation, Prof. Peiris said his position was explicit and categorical.
We have one aim and objective. That is to protect Sri Lanka and the armed forces, he said.
Prof. Peiris questioned the present government inviting the head of the Global Tamil Forum S.J. Emmanuel to Sri Lanka. (Kelum Bandara)

Dont shed tears after attacking us and destroying media freedom'
	
President Maithripala Sirisena today said he made a humble appeal from the friends of the media not to shed tears after attacking, weakening and destroying the government by way of destroying the enabled democracy and media freedom in the country.
The President said he was making this request from the media institutions which did not give a proper coverage to the government but obstructed it.
Addressing the Water Filling Ceremony of the Moragahakanda  Kaluganga Reservoir at Laggala, he added that when the people watched private TV channels, in the afternoon, they were compelled to feel that there was no government, there was no administration, no law and order and no governance but only misery, mayhem and sufferings.
Both, the print and electronic media in the private sector in many instances used an unimportant but sensational statement of a politician or top government official - in many instances a slip of the tongue - to attack the government and its action. What they try to depict is that this government has done nothing for the people. But I request you, not to forget the freedom, dignity, self-respect we gave you after January 8, 2015. I never ask you to take the governments side but tell the truth. Show the truth and print the truth. Dont forget that you give publicity to all these negative and malicious comments against the government while enjoying the independence, democratic rights and dignity this government restored for you, President Sirisena emphasized.
He said the private media has hopelessly failed to give a glimpse of good deeds of the unity government to the people. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Govt. doesnt want to change Constitution: Namal
	
Joint Opposition MP Namal Rajapaksa today said the government was not interested in changing the Constitution and that was why the 20th Amendment had been presented in Parliament as a private members bill.
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) presented the 20th Amendment in Parliament to abolish the Executive Presidency.
MP Rajapaksa yesterday said the JVP was also a member of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly which mandated to draft constitutional proposals.
The JVP bringing in the 20A is a joke when they are also members of the Steering Committee. This shows the government is neither interested in changing the Constitution nor solving the issues faced by the Sri Lankans including the Tamils, he told a news briefing.
The news briefing was held to announce the JOs decision to reschedule the date on which its anti-government protest Janabalaya Kolambata would be held.
The MP said former president Mahinda Rajapaksa has instructed them to reschedule the protest to September 5 to avoid any form of disruption to the students who would sit for the A/L exams this year.
Earlier, we scheduled to hold the protest on August 17. However, the A/L exam which will be held till September 1. Therefore, the former president instructed us to reschedule the date to September 5, he said.
He said their objective is to form a people's government and invited anyone who is against the government to joint them at the protest which will be held in Colombo. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Have fun with  literary  time travel
	

There are ten chapters, covering all epochs, and aspects, of literature from the Biblical toGreco-Roman andmodern times.
What Polish-born author who knew no English till his twenties, wrote the Secret Sharer and the Heart of Darkness
The Arabian Nights, by the way, is a very good read, often much more rewarding than randomly surfingthe net.
Id read aboutTristam Shandy, though I never saw a copyanywhere. I wonder if the British Council library had one.


A very interesting little book came my way at the Public Library. In the World of Literature by Ceil Cleveland is a quiz book, testing ones knowledge of fiction, drama, poetry as well as non-fiction. Since I considered my reading to be not too bad at least in the first three categories (a dangerous illusion), I began leafing through it and discovered more books waiting to be read than what Ive read. Worse, there were plenty of things I hadnt even heard of
There are ten chapters, covering all epochs, and aspects, of literature from the Biblical to Greco-Roman and modern times. The focus is on Western literature, but I discovered a thing or two on its eastern counterpart, too. There are ten chapters with titles such as Greek to me: Gods and Goddesses, To be or Not to Be an Expert on Shakespeare, Fiction: A Novel Way to go etc. 
Lets start with that chapter on fiction. It asks you to name an eleventh century Japanese novel by Lady Murasaki, considered one of the greatest novels of Japanese literature. 
I have no idea, since its the first time Id heard of Lady Murasaki. The answer is: The Tale of Genjii, believed to be the first full novel in the world. Lady Murasaki was a lady in waiting for empress Akiki, and it has been compared to Marcel Prousts In Remembrance of Things Past as a study of decadent nobility.

"This late 19th century writer wrote stories dealing with innovation and technology. His first published fiction was a short story called Five Weeks in a Baloon which appeared in 1863. What was his masterpiece,W written ten years later, and what was his name"

What 1767 book by Lawrence Sterne has several blank pages, several totally black pages, a stream of consciousness style and has no plot I didnt know that, either, and the answer is: Tristam Shandy, still considered avant-garde literature because of its experimental form. 
Id read about Tristam Shandy, though I never saw a copy anywhere. I wonder if the British Council library had one. I wonder too, just how the author managed to find a publisher in that age. Stream of consciousness, by the way, is a literary method generally attributed to James Joyce, author of Ulysses. 
What monumental work by Leo Tolstoy depicts the lives of two noble families during the Napoleonic Wars
That should be an easy oneWar and Peace. On the other hand, how many people I know of have read it Well, one, two.and again, back to one. Funny, the number keeps slipping back to one, and that one is myself. It may be that I dont move in the right circles.
Two of Doestoveskys Karamazov brothers were Dmitri and Smerdyakov. What are the names of the other two  one the skeptic, and the other an innocent I read the Brothers Karamazov during my school days, along with most of the Russian classics. Most of those names are etched in my memory, but this question stymied me. I did remember the innocent ones name. Hes Alyosha.
Well, Ivan is the skeptic. It may be that the Brothers Karamazov is a difficult work and I didnt like it all that much. 
What Polish-born author who knew no English till his twenties, wrote the Secret Sharer and the Heart of Darkness
That should be an easy one, especially those who have studied English literature at school. I can add to that question by asking people to name two famous novels by Conrad (what was his Polish name, by the way).
Samuel L. Clemens chose the pen name of Mark Twain. What earlier occupation supplied him with this pen name 
His career as a river boat pilot on the Mississippi River. Mark Twain was as popular as Robert Louis Stephenson those days. I have no idea how it is now.
A bit of tricky logic referred to in a novel about World War II went like this: The only way a recruit could get out of the miserable armed forces was to plead insanity. But by desiring with all his heart to get out of the miserable armed forces, one was judged ipso facto sane. What was this rule called
Thats a good one, and the answer is: Joseph Hellers Catch-22. The moment I started reading the only way a recruit could get out of the miserable armed forces I knew it had to be Catch-22. A memorable film was made out of the book. Heller, who was Jewish, must have hated his stint in the army. Question: when would a Sri Lankan writer come out with a book like that I doubt if that would ever happen, because the military is entrenched now as a sacred cow.
How did the thieves die in Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves
Thats a good one since Id forgotten. Well, they were boiled in oil. They climbed into tall jars to hide, but were discovered and boiled in oil. The Arabian Nights, by the way, is a very good read, often much more rewarding than randomly surfing the net.
What is the title of Boris Pasternaks epic novel about upheavals in 20th century Russia
Dr. Zhivago. Those who havent read the book should at least see the movie. Theres two of them. Another question. Who directed the first, and more interesting, movie of the two
This late 19th century writer wrote stories dealing with innovation and technology. His first published fiction was a short story called Five Weeks in a Baloon which appeared in 1863. What was his masterpiece, written ten years later, and what was his name 
That should be easy, too, if that word baloon rings a bell. Its Jules Verne, and the book is Around the World in Eighty Days, in which the principal mode of transport is a helium-powered balloon.
Lets check out the drama quiz in the next article.

SL has become an international  Drug trafficking Hub  - Ranjith Madduma Bandara
	

There is a nexus between drug trafficking and underworld operations
	
	Four underworld kingpins operate from outside the country
	
	Underworld operations during MR rule as well
	
	Crime rate dropped since 2015
	
	UNP will nominate its own presidential candidate for sure

Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara, in an interview with Daily Mirror, shares his views on the current crime wave and plans for the elections pending at the moment. The Minister shared the following:-

Q There is a rise in the number of organized crimes and armed robberies. What is the reason behind this alarming increase
There are several aspects to it. Actually, the crime rate has dropped since 2015. There is a drop in robberies. Also, the number of sexual and child abuses have come down. Yet, we find clashes between armed groups. Rival underworld gangs carry out organized crimes against each other. We have increased raids. Already, 40 persons involved in organized crimes have been put behind bars. We seize drugs. In fact, we seized the largest haul of heroin recently with a street value of Rs.1,250 million. We have noticed that the street value of heroin has trebled in Sri Lanka now. In addition, drug trafficking has triggered rivalry among those involved. 

"There is a drop in robberies. Also, the number of sexual and child abuses have come down. Yet, we find clashes between armed groups. Rival underworld gangs carry out organized crimes against each other. Already, 40 persons involved in organized crimes have been put behind bars"


QDrugs smuggled in such large quantities into Sri Lanka. Has the country become an international drug trafficking hub lately
Sri Lanka has become a drug trafficking hub and we have received information to that effect. Some kinds of narcotics have been smuggled to be peddled locally. Last year, we seized more than 1500 kg of cocaine. It is an expensive drug, but not used in Sri Lanka. It means Sri Lanka has become a transitional point of drug smuggling.

QHow do you intend to curb such crimes
We need to get international assistance. We are acting in this direction. We have signed certain international covenants and need to ratify a few more. 

QWhat are the challenges you encounter in curbing these organized crimes
I did not face any political interference. No minister talked to me in this regard. We are acting to set up special units to deal with the situation. We have arrested a lot and jailed them. We see these crimes are manoeuvred by those living overseas. Some prisoners operate such crimes from their prison cells. It is a big problem. 

QHow many underworld leaders are living abroad
There are at least four such main gang leaders who are living and operating from abroad.

QThe government envisaged Interpols assistance to trace former SL Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga. Why dont you get Interpols assistance to arrest these underworld gang leaders too in the same way
The government is making every possible effort. But, there is scant support from some countries to apprehend these criminals. Therefore, we need to sign international agreements. 

QWhat are the other barriers
Actually, if we can strengthen the mechanism to get international assistance, it will facilitate our investigations. It has become difficult for us to get information from international sources. It is more so for us in carrying out investigations into financial frauds as well. 

QWhat is the reason for the sudden emergence of these underworld groups
Gang rivalry. 

QPresident Maithripala Sirisena proposed to implement capital punishment for drug trafficking. What is your opinion
Even death row criminals operate drug businesses from the prison cells. The Cabinet unanimously decided to implement the death sentence. 

QBut, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera is opposed to it. Also, the heads of missions of European Union countries, Canada and Norway had expressed their objections. How do you proceed with it at this backdrop
There is international influence. We might face a cut in international assistance if we go ahead with the capital punishment. We need to reconcile all aspects. 

QYou said drug trafficking is operated by prisoners in some cases. They cannot do it without the assistance from the prison authorities. How are you going to tackle this issue
We have informed the prison authorities, yet, it happens. Some officers seem to be aiding and abetting prisoners in this regard. I do not pinpoint all the officers. We are in discussion with the Justice Minister to address this issue. These are long standing issues. 


"Some officers seem to be aiding and abetting prisoners in this regard. We are in discussion with the Justice Minister to address this issue. These are long standing issues"


QThe prison authorities are answerable to the government. Then, what is the barrier that prevents them from handling this issue
We are in touch with the Justice Minister. 

QYou are a veteran in the political circle with more than three decades of experience in Parliament. People point their fingers at politicians for nurturing the underworld rings to unleash violence against their opponents How do you see the evolution of it in the country over the years
The underworld had been in operation during the former rule as well. We are aware of an underworld gang that killed 18 members of the same family. It happened during the Rajapaksa regime. There were about 30 rival killings. Such cases were not highlighted in the media. Journalists were intimidated and abducted. But today, there prevails a peaceful atmosphere. We do not notice thunder accompanied by heavy rain. If it is thunder only, we feel. That is how I compare the two different situations. 

QActually, I am asking about the evolution of underworld criminal activities from a sociological point of view. The underworld flourished under every regime with political patronage. Some people argue that it happened after the introduction of the open economy in 1977. How do you view this situation
Underworld and drug trafficking are intertwined. International drug trafficking is a crime committed in a well-organized manner. We need to curb drug trafficking. The underworld gangs are financed by drug trafficking. It is an international problem. Earlier, we had only Kasippu (illicitly distilled alcoholic beverage) and Ganja (cannabis) as narcotics. Today, it covers a variety of items such as Kerala ganja, ganja, heroin, cocaine, hashish etc. These are available in different forms such as tablets, stickers etc. We need to use advanced technologies to detect them. We have to amend our laws to deal with the emerging threats. 

QEarlier, you stressed the need to deploy the military personnel to arrest the trend. How far have you progressed in the evolution of laws for it
Only under the state of emergency, we can deploy the military to deal with civil activities. There is no state of emergency now. Therefore, we have to work out new legislation to provide for it.

QYou undertook a visit to Jaffna recently. How did you assess the situation there
We held extensive talks with the Chief Minister, Governor, senior police officers and others. The situation is not as bad as it has been portrayed by the opposition there. Our intelligence authorities stand alert. As for the Ava criminal gang, it is viewed as the resurgence of the LTTE. Yet, it is not the case. These criminals are youths who are mimicking violent scenes in South Indian movies. They seem to have been inspired by sword attacks. They emulate cowboy characters. They brandish swords. Actually, there is no veracity in the allegations being made by Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna or Pohottuwa members. 

"Our supporters want an UNPer to be the President. The UNP could not get one of its members elected as the President since 1994. So, our party men want a President who hails from the UNP"

QWhy cant the police control the situation
The police have acted in this regard. Numerous suspects have been arrested. Today, there are a lot of foreign remittances to the north. Misusing of such money is also adding to the chaos. There are unemployment issues as well. So we have to think about these issues. 

QBefore the advent of the LTTE in 1970s, there were criminal activities such as drug smuggling from India. In fact, it served as a precursor to the emergence of the LTTE. How serious is the problem in that context
In order to curb these issues, the intelligence services remain on high alert.

QThere is an allegation that the intelligence services have been crippled. What are your comments on this
It is not true. Our intelligence authorities are very active. It was an attempt to whip up unnecessary fear. 


"As for the Ava criminal gang, it is viewed as the resurgence of the LTTE. Yet, it is not the case. These criminals are youths who are mimicking violent scenes in South Indian movies. They seem to have been inspired by sword attacks. They emulate cowboy characters and brandish swords"

QKerala Ganja is smuggled into the country from India. How do you seek cooperation from the sub continent to deal with the situation
We have seized more than 3000 kg of Kerala Ganja. We intend to open talks with the Indian authorities to take necessary steps. The police submitted various proposals to us in this regard. We need Indias help to identify the accused and bring them here to be tried legally. 

QApart from that, how do you see the political situation
We are working on it now and are ready to face elections.

QThere is an allegation that you are planning to postpone PC polls. How true is it
We are ready for them.

QElections to three councils are already overdue...
Yes, it will increase to six by December. We insist that the elections to all of them should be conducted on the same day. 

QWhat is your plan for the presidential election
The UNP will nominate its own candidate for sure.

QDuring the last couple of occasions, you supported a common candidate. Why is there a change of strategy this time
Our supporters want an UNPer to be the President. The UNP could not get one of its members elected as the President since 1994. So, our party men want a President who hails from the UNP.

QAny idea of who the possible candidate would be...
He would emerge at the last moment. Late President R. Premadasa came forward in the same fashion in 1989. After that all those who became Presidents were announced at the last moment. We will also do the same next time.

Tamil Nadu irrelevant in SL issue - Wigneswaran
	
Northern Province Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran said it was difficult for him to gauge the role of India in resolving the Tamil National Question in Sri Lanka because that country seemed to be adopting a non-interference attitude.
In an interview with the Daily Mirror, the Chief Minister said Sri Lanka would have to submit its report on the progress made in this regard to the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Geneva in March 2019.
Asked about the kind of influence of South Indian parties, he said Tamil Nadu factor was irrelevant. He said there was a lot of infighting among the parties there.
Tamil Nadu is irrelevant now. They have their own problems. This is not a matter to be worried about, he said.
In the absence of the United States, he said there were other countries like the United Kingdom, conscious of Sri Lankas issue.
I believe the pressure on our Government to fulfil its obligations under the Consensus Resolution, will not be any lighter, just because the US has pulled out, he said.
I do not think our future is bleak as such. There are ways that pressure can be brought to the Government, he said. (Kelum Bandara)

THE TIMES THEY ARE CHANGING - EDITORIAL
	
uly marks the commencement of one of the darkest periods in this country. Following the ambushing and killing of 13 soldiers in the north, the government of this country condoned a section of its people to be brutally massacred by another section of our countrymen. Following these events, for a period of 35 years, 9 months, 3 weeks and 4 days -- both Sinhalese and Tamils unleashed brutalities and crimes against humanity on each other.
Today, July 23, 2018, both Sinhalese and Tamils need to collectively hang our heads in shame. We need to accept that in our name, be we Sinhalese or Tamils, we tacitly allowed death and destruction to be rained on innocent men women and children. Many among us, again both Sinhalese and Tamils, were opposed to the destruction being visited upon the other in the name of community.
But we did little to oppose the ongoing atrocities. Perhaps we were afraid of the consequences of outspokenly opposing the horrible crimes which were committed in our name. But the fact remains we did not make known our opposition to the dastardly deeds committed in our name.
In the south, a few Sinhalese protested at the draconian legislation in the form of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). Very few, if at all, protested the myriad of attacks on an innocent Tamil civilian population under cover of this Act nor did we see many demanding the release of young boys and girls who later disappeared under the provisions of this Act.
Entire villages in the east of the country razed, but even NGOs normally in the forefront of human rights causes took to the streets to protest the atrocities. In like manner, when the armed struggle commenced in the Tamil areas of the north and east, lamppost killings were frequent. People were accused by one militant group or the other of some petty crime, tied to a lamppost and shot out of hand.
There was no opposition or condemnation of these killings. Even when particular Tamil militant leaders like TELO leader Sri Sabaratnam was brutally dragged behind a jeep through the streets of Jaffna and killed, by a particular group which claimed to be the sole representative of the Tamil people, no one protested. In some places the opposite happened, celebrations appeared to breakout and traders began distributing soft drinks to people in the vicinity...
When a giant Tamil intellectual like Dr. Neelan Tiruchelvam was killed by a suicide bomber or when TULF leader Amirthalingam was shot in cold blood there was no outpouring of grief among the Tamil people, nor did we see protests in the North and East against the killings. In fact Dr. Neelan Thiruchlvam was labelled a traitor to the Tamil cause.
When bus loads of Sinhalese people, including infants and children were targeted and killed, protests did not breakout in the north and east against the atrocities. Nor did protests breakout when the Muslim populations in the north and east were ethnically cleansed.
Its time to stop misquoting Franz Fanons phrase in The Wretched Of The Earth that violence committed by the victims of oppression, cannot be equated with that of the oppressor. Despite our thin veneer of civilization, both Sinhalese and Tamils, did in the past tacitly approve the atrocities committed in our name.
Sadly, in the near 10-year period since the armed opposition was crushed, we have not moved beyond the stage of blaming each other for past sins. Some leaders on both sides of the ethnic divide continue rousing tensions based on ethnicity, religion and race. It is also time to face another home truth. There is a distinct disconnect between the the younger generation of Sinhalese and Tamils, regarding the events of July 83, the war which followed.
In Palestine, young people are in the forefront of the struggle against Israel because the atrocities against the Palestinians never ceased.
In Sri Lanka, the situation is different. Small but significant changes have occurred.
But the state has missed many opportunities to eradicate the fears of the vanquished. The Tamils expected the government to protect them. After the war, this was not apparent. Let the people honour their fallen dead, its a small but significant step. The military should work with the local government to build infrastructure country-wide, rebuilding playgrounds, hospitals and roads
Its time to remember, learn lessons of the past and ensure history does not repeat itself.

UNP needs a new face as Prez Candidate: Wasantha
	
State Minister of Foreign Affairs Wasantha Senanayake was of the opinion that the time was ripe for the UNP to introduce a new face to be its presidential candidate if it intends to taste success at the next Presidential Poll.
He said this while distributing lawn mowers to the self-employed on Saturday (21) in the Mananpitiya area in Dimbulagala in the Polonnaruwa District.
He said, I have also been subjected to injustice by this government. I could have delivered a lot to the people of Polonnaruwa had I been given a proper portfolio. The only way forward for the UNP is to field a new candidate next time. We have competent ministers. If we field one of them as the candidate, we can win. I am not going to mention their names, as otherwise they will be politically victimized. I will fight on behalf of the members of our party until justice is served.
He said he had regard for the UNP because his great-grandfather had founded it. He said, " I have no animosity toward anyone for not giving me a Cabinet portfolio. I don't mind another member representing Polonnaruwa being given a Cabinet portfolio. I was not given a Cabinet post because of political jealousy. I will not quit the party because of it," he promised.
Many UNPers, including Vice Chairman of the Dimbulagala Pradeshiya Sabha Sisira Kumara Deshapriya, participated in the event.(Nimal Jayaratna)

Vijayakalas outburst  and Elephant in the room
	

he speech by the former State Minister of Childrens Affairs Vijayakala Maheswaran has been magnified in the media as a call by her for the return of an LTTE administration to maintain law and order and secure the safety of women in the North.
I have used the term outburst because the content of the speech is not in the form of a considered statement and is more in the nature of an emotional outburst. The sexual abuse and murder of a six-year-old child and another incident mentioned by the ex-Minister had evidently put her into an emotional state where she hit out at her own Governments inability to maintain law and order and made her mindful of an earlier period when discipline was strongly enforced, and she suggested the revival of the LTTE as the panacea.
My objective, however, is to point out that she and others like her seemed to have missed the elephant in the room, which is the community in which these crimes are being committed and the need to try and reform this community. In this instance for example the crime itself was not committed by outsiders but by the childs own 22-year-old relative. While the police, no doubt have a responsibility to maintain law and order, they cannot be expected to be in charge of or control the moral values and behaviour of the larger community in which these crimes take place. Vijayakala also refers to widespread drug use and alcohol imbibing prevalent in the north and refers to politicians as bringing these items into the society. Obviously all these factors are interconnected with the prevalent sexual abuses and assaults as well as gang violence and robberies.
There is a perception among a section of society that there is the sense of a general malaise in this community where many young people in the urban centres particularly, prefer to be dependent on the remittances of hardworking relatives abroad rather than undertake some gainful employment themselves. Combining with this is lack of interest in education and instead the urge to go abroad to western countries where they imagine an easier life is possible. The interest in education and learning which was the hallmark of the Jaffna man is sadly less evident.

"Vijayakala also refers to widespread drug use and alcohol imbibing prevalent in the north and refers to politicians as bringing these items into the society"
I would say that these are all features of a society which is still coming out of the trauma of a 30- year war, the theatre of which has been the northern and eastern provinces. Presently, the Tamil- speaking people feel excluded from the body politic. They feel that they have no part in the administration of the Country. A visit to the Central Ministries in Colombo would strengthen this view not only because of the paucity of Tamil-speaking officers in these Ministries but also because of the indifference to matters concerning these provinces.

"The Police should be able to function in the Tamil language, receiving complaints and writing down statements in the Tamil language"

This sense of not having a role to play leads to the general malaise in the society and makes the young people feel that they have no future in this country. This is also what makes some sections of the people recall the LTTE administration favourably as in the case of Vijayakala. Because, during this period, whatever the hardships and strict discipline enforced, the Tamil people were at the centre of the administration. Their concerns, language and culture were given importance.
This is what lies at the back of Vijayakalas cry what has this government done for us except give back some lands of ours they had taken. So if this Government is to win the confidence of the people, they must actively engage with the people. Whether it is Reconciliation or Rehabilitation, the people must be given a participatory role. It should not be a top down bureaucratic exercise. The official languages policy must be actively enforced so that Tamil citizens of the Country can at least receive communications from their government in their own language. There must be symbolic steps taken as for example the National Anthem must be always sung in both languages when the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation closes its services at night. In Singapore, for example, the broadcasts are in all four languages of the citizens, including Tamil.

"Whether it is Reconciliation or Rehabilitation, the people must be given a participatory role. It should not be a top down bureaucratic exercise"
Institutions such as the Provincial Council and Tamil-speaking people with executive power in the central government such as Vijayakala should also be playing a positive role. The Minister in charge of Childrens Affairs could have initiated programmes to raise awareness of child protection, instead of merely railing against the government of which she herself was a State Minister. Of course she could not change the community single-handedly but other responsible bodies like the Provincial Council and religious institutions also have a responsibility towards it.

"If the Community feel the Police are not proactive enough, why not encourage youth; especially young women to join the Police force"

They could also undertake campaigns against these abuses and focus attention on these aspects of the communities lives. Inaugurating more cultural activities, public lectures on educational and other matters and distance education through the TV and the internet could also be tried as a means of weaning people away from their addiction to drink and drugs. If the Community feel that the Police are not proactive enough, why not encourage young people, and especially young women to join the Police force
In Tamil Nadu, for example, Police stations run by Policewomen alone (All Women Police Stations had been instituted by the late Chief Minister Jayalalitha and have proved very successful as women feel more comfortable reporting sexual crimes at these police stations). The requirement of a pass in mathematics at the O/Levels for constables which is, I understand, a stumbling block for would-be recruits is due to the lack of Mathematics teachers in the schools. This could be rectified by giving exemptions for candidates from certain districts for a stated period , while also providing more mathematics teachers to schools in the rural areas. It must be recognized as a policy that the areas which were war affected be given certain concessions till they can be brought up to the required standards. A major requisite for maintaining law and order in the Province is to improve the existing Police services. The Police strength has to be brought up with the recruitment of more recruits from the province, as well as streamlined removing indiscipline and corruption from the ranks. The Police should be able to function in the Tamil language, receiving complaints and writing down statements in that language. 
There is another aspect of the speech which merits analysis. Vijayakalas outburst also brings out her perception and probably that of others in the community as well, as to what is the best form of governance and what constitutes law and order in a society. It is here that I feel apprehension because she seems to imply that law and order and security of people in general, is best maintained under a dictatorial or authoritarian form of governance. Hence she shows nostalgia for that aspect of the era when the LTTE-controlled several parts of the North and East, and calls for the return of such an administration.
It is well known that the LTTE maintained a strict discipline and close watch over the people under their control. For that reason women as well as people in general were able to move around freely without fear. Armed gangs would have been given short-shift, and crimes such as sexual abuse and harassment would receive summary justice. However, Vijayakala prefers not to remember that there were many young girls and boys in the rural villages in the north and east especially in extremely poor and depressed class villages who were taken away from their weeping parents forcibly and made to fight in the war only to die as cannon fodder.
A Court in the Netherlands in 2015, used the evidence compiled by a Dutch female tourist about Tamil girls in the Eastern Province abducted and forcibly conscripted as child soldiers, while on their way to tuition classes, to convict five persons collecting money for the LTTE. Abduction itself is a crime and conscription of children to fight in a war is a war crime. Furthermore in such a society, there are no checks and balances. All dissent is severely punished. For this reason, so many Ilankai Tamil Arasu Katchi (Federal party) MPs, including their late leader Appapillai Amirthalingam were mercilessly gunned down because they took the view that a negotiated settlement, and non-violent methods were the way to solve the ethnic problem and win Tamil rights. Dissent of any kind against the views of the fuhrer is something that is not to be tolerated in such a disciplined society.
In a similar view expressed in the South, none other than the Anunayake of the Malwatha Maha Nikaya, a chief Buddhist prelate has urged a would-be Presidential candidate to be a Hitler. Obviously this fascination with authoritarianism and dare I say fascism, although hopefully confined to a few at present, runs on both sides of the ethnic divide. Hitler, it must be remembered got rid of his political opponents - both Christian Democrats as well as Communists, burnt the Parliament (Reichstag) and carried out a policy of ethnic-cleansing under which six million Jews, Slavs, Gypsies and several other communities (considered vermin) were systematically executed, gassed to death or worked to death in concentration camps. His plans to enlarge the boundaries of the fatherland and to rule the world brought about the World War II and the ultimate destruction of Germany which came to be divided between the four allied powers who had won the war. The Germans underwent terrible suffering, especially those on the eastern front who had to face the advancing Soviet Red Army which had many wrongs to repay.   
The Tamils of the north and east have had their share of death and destruction due to the war. Even today we have with us the war widows whom Vijayakala refers to solicitously. But would she want to see a repetition of this same scenario when she calls for the return of an LTTE administration. The Germans, after Hitler, rebuilt their country with sheer grit and determination, to become the powerhouse of Europe under a Federal and Democratic Constitution. This could be an example that Sri Lanka and the North-East Tamils could well emulate rather than indulging in nostalgia for earlier authoritarian or fascist regimes.

99X Technology ranked among Sri Lankas Best Workplaces for sixth consecutive year
	
As organisations evolve dramatically to create and accommodate the millennial workplace, it has been established that a great corporate culture is the cornerstone to succeeding in this endeavour. Understanding this early on, software product engineering company 99X Technology has strived to put as much effort into creating an open work culture as they have into technology development and innovation.
Once again, this saw 99X Technology being ranked among Sri Lankas 25 best workplaces for the sixth consecutive year by the Great Place To Work Institute Sri Lanka. Additionally, it received honours at a regional level when it was listed among Asias Best Workplaces for 2018, the only Sri Lankan company among the 25 enterprises in the Small and Medium Enterprises category.
The company, along with 24 others, were felicitated earlier this month at an awards ceremony hosted at the Hilton, Colombo. Here, 99X Technology received further commendations, as it swept up the Excellence Award in Inspiring Employees and the Gold Award in the Small Enterprise Category.
Its one thing to say you want a great culture and quite another to be able to shape your peoples beliefs around the vision the company has. Our culture is driven and enhanced by our people themselves thanks to the empowerment that they receive, and this is something that is recognized time and time again by the Great Place To Work Institute. As in previous years, it is truly an honour to be ranked among these companies who are leading the way in creating great workplaces, stated 99X Technology Co-Founder and CEO Mano Sekaram.
Over 115 companies in Sri Lanka from over 20 key sectors participated in this years survey, representing nearly 62,000 employees in the country. Data accumulated over the six years of conducting the Great Place To Work study in Sri Lanka displays an overall improvement within the top 25, with all dimensions scoring in the 80th percentile in 2018. These dimensions consist of credibility, respect, fairness, pride and camaraderie. When considering overall dimension scoring, the 25 best workplaces have maintained a positive trend in each dimension with an overall lead of 17 points over the rest of the workplaces in the country.
