Video: CID records Buddhika Pathirana's statement
	
UNP Matara District MP Buddika Pathirana yesterday gave a statement to the CID with regard to a statement made by him about an army contract involving several billions of rupees.
Mr. Pathirana told the media that the CID informed him that they needed to record a statement from him after he revealed a fraudulent act involving a contract to supply food to the army.
I complained that the army food contract was given out for Rs.50 billion in 2010 though it could have been carried out for Rs.16 billion. The contract for 2015 has been signed for Rs.20 billion but that I suspected it would be given out for more in 2016," he said.
He said the CID was trying to find how I got hold of the documents with regard to the fraud rather than investigating the fraud.
I am a peoples representative. I get information in various ways. I am not prepared to hand over the evidence I have collected to anyone else. But I am prepared to show it to the detectives, he said.
Mr. Pathirana said he bought some documents of the 2016 tender list for Rs.5,000 from an army officer. It is a regrettable incident. I do not want to insult the army but I am only revealing the frauds so that steps could be taken to stop these acts being repeated, he said.
He arrived at the CID around 11.30 am and his statement had been recorded for several hours.

	Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa said yesterday that it was the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) that should bear the responsibility for the alleged non-settlement of dues to the Independent Television Network (ITN) for telecasting his advertisements prior to the January presidential election, as he was the party's candidate and not an independent candidate.
	Mr. Rajapaksa expressed these views soon after making a statement before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC), with regard to losses caused to the state owned ITN during the last presidential election.
	I was asked a few questions by a police team that arrived at my residence and I answered them. The party should take complete responsibility over the matter because I was the candidate of the party. The party will take the responsibility, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana and Indika Sri Aravinda)

New US-sponsored resolution on SL tabled
	
	The US-sponsored resolution on Sri Lanka that calls for the participation of Commonwealth and other foreign judges in a Sri Lankan judicial mechanism that would be set up to address issues of accountability, was finally tabled at the UNHRC a short while ago following a series of negotiations between the Sri Lankan delegation and the Core Group of sponsors of the resolution.
	The resolution co-sponsored by UK, Macedonia and Montenegro, was due to be tabled today by 1pm in Geneva time, but experienced a setback due to prolonged negotiations over the language since objections were raised against certain paragraphs and wording included in the draft text by the Sri Lankan delegation.
	The resolution while welcoming the governments recognition an accountability process to uphold the rule of law, appreciates the proposal made by the GoSL to establish a judicial mechanism with a Special Counsel to probe into allegations human rights and international humanitarian law violations. It also affirms the importance of having independent judicial and prosecutorial institutions led by personnel known for integrity and impartiality and has further noted the importance of participation in a Sri Lankan judicial mechanism, including the Special Counsels office, of Commonwealth and other foreign judges, defence lawyers, and authorized prosecutors and investigators.
	The resolution has also welcomed the positive engagement between the GoSL and the High Commissioner for Human Rights and his office since the new government came into power.
	The text also supports the governments four-tiered accountability mechanism unveiled by Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera during his address at the opening event of the 30th UNHRC session.
	Furthermore it notes that the commitments made by the government, if fully and credibly implemented, would help account for serious crimes by all sides and help achieve reconciliation. 
	The resolution has also recognised the need for accountability and reconciliation process for the violations and abuses committed by the LTTE as highlighted in the recently released OISL (OHCHR Investigation on Sri Lanka) report.
	Moreover, it has called for the OHCHR to continue to monitor Sri Lankas progress in the implementation of its recommendations and other relevant processes linked to reconciliation, accountability, and human rights and calls for the High Commissioners Office to present an oral update to the UNHRC at its 32nd session as well as a comprehensive report followed by discussion on the implementation of the present resolution at its 34th session.

Video: Suspect in Seya's murder confesses
	
	A 32 year-old man, who was arrested last evening by the Criminal Investigations Department in Bemmulla, Gampaha had confessed to the rape and murder of five year old Seya Sadewmini, the Police said.
	Police spokesman SSP Priyantha Jayakody said that the suspect was arrested while hiding in a jungle in Bemmulla.
	The suspect had confessed to the rape and murder of the girl following interrogation by the Criminal Investigations Department.
	Police said that the suspect is a bachelor and lives in close vicinity to the house of the murdered child.
	The Police earlier arrested two suspects including a 17 year old schoolboy. The arrest of the school boy drew protest against the Police action as the boy had been identified. The mother of the school boy had corroborated that he was at home on the fateful day of the murder.
	The two suspects including the schoolboy arrested previously, have been remanded till the 28th of this month.
	According to police sources, the suspect, in the Seya rape-murder case had made a lengthy confession to the CID.
	In it, he had said, As I was passing by the house of the child whom I abducted, I saw a light coming from a room. The window was opened and I saw three children were sleeping in one bed and a woman in the other.
	"I have a habit of secretly watching women sleeping and bathing. I also like children. As I was looking through the window, I saw one beautiful girl asleep. I tried the front door handle to enter because I couldnt jump through the window. The door was unlocked and I entered the room discreetly.
	I carried the child out of the house through the front door as I feared she would wake up. Her mother was fast asleep and didnt wake up.
	The child remained fast asleep as I carried her out on my shoulder.
	In the confession, he had detailed, step by step, to the CID officers how he had raped and killed the little girl, a senior police officer said.
	It had been revealed that the suspect had hidden the dead body of the child near a river bank and had gone to his sisters home in Ingammaruwa.
	A brother of the suspect had seen him wearing clothes with bloodstains and the suspect had told his brother, with threats, not to reveal anything.
	Police said the suspect had spent most of his life in the wilderness; and he had fled to the Bemmulla area and stayed in the wilds as well as in a cemetery for 12 days after committing the crime.
	The 32 year-old suspect, Dunesh Priyashantha alias Kondaya had described, in detail, the sexual abuse of five-year-old girl child Seya Sadewmi in his confession to the CID. However, it will not be published here due to the manner in which the crime had been committed. The confession cannot be revealed in a civilized society.
	The mother of the suspect arrested in connection with the death of Seya, speaking to the media, said that her husband had been convicted of theft and jailed and died in prison. She had one daughter and three sons.
	She had never being to school. Her second son was taken into custody by police on charges of killing a small child. My third son "Kondaya" who was arrested now as the suspect was a school dropout. He used to wander here and there and spend most of his time in jungles.
	I am aware that this son was in the habit of lurking in places where women bathe. He was in the habit of stealing womens undergarments. Villagers come and complain to me about him. On occasions he had been beaten up by villagers. He had also stolen pots of rice from houses. People had warned him, but to no avail. He is very obstinate. He hates to brush his teeth or wash his face or bathe, instead he prefers to get into streams and catch fish and either eat them raw or cook them over an open fire and eat them.

Video: Police have committed a grave injustice: Dr. Prathiba
	
	The Commissioner of the Human Rights, Dr. Prathiba Mahanamahewa said today that the 17-year-old schoolboy, who was arrested over the rape and killing of five-year-old Seya Sadewmi, was the victim of a grave injustice.
	He said the student could complain to the Human Rights Council and also take the matter to court.
	The rights of the 17-year-old boy have been violated by his unjustifiable arrest. Police may arrest people as long as there is sufficient evidence against them. The arrest of the student raises the doubts as to whether he was arrested after due investigation, he said.
	He said the police had said one reason for the arrest was the presence of pornographic material on his laptop. If this is so, many others should have been arrested for keeping pornographic material with them, he said.
	Dr. Mahanamahewa said that, as a country which is a signatory to the Convention on Child Rights, Sri Lanka is bound to protect reputation of children. No mental or physical harm should be done to children. The arrested student will face many obstacles on his release, he said.
	He also criticised some media reports which attempted to portray the student as a criminal and said it was time for the media to rectify their errors. The student can also complain to the press council, he said.
	Meanwhile, the Lanka Teachers' Union Secretary Joseph Stalin condemned the rape and killing of the girl and said the police treatment of the suspects in custody was unacceptable.
	As soon as the suspects were arrested, the police acted as if the suspects had already been convicted. They accused the schoolboy of using ganja and said they found pornographic material on his laptop. This is completely wrong. Any suspect is innocent until proven guilty, he said.
	He said the police had acted without responsibility and asked how the 17-year-old bot who is an A/L student could return to school or face his parents and peers. One precious life has already lost and another life is being subjected to police injustice, he said.
	Mr. Stalin said immediate action should be taken, to produce the student in court to ascertain whether he is guilty or not. If he is guilty he should be punished and if not should be released immediately. Justice delayed is justice denied, he said.
	However, Police Spokesman SSP Priyantha Jayakody said the court will take appropriate action on the two suspects who are on remand.
	They were arrested and produced in court in order to conduct medical tests on them and to obtain DNA samples. These are required to determine if they match the foreign matter found on Sadewmi during the postmortem, SSP Jayakody said.
	He said the necessary laboratory tests were being carried out and Court would would base its decision on the analytical reports. (Sanath Desmond and Lahiru Pothmulla)

We are for a domestic inquiry with local experts: Champika
	
	Megapolis and Western Province Development Minister Champika Ranawaka said today that allegations of war crimes should be investigated under the existing judicial system by local experts in a manner that would ensure the dignity of the armed forces and those found guilty punished.
	He told a news conference that there should be a national consensus on this matter and that a final decision should be taken up by parliament while assuring compromise and unity.
	An investigation should be launched on the basis that the aggressor is the LTTE. Investigations should be done by local experts. Cases should be taken up under the existing judiciary system and punish those found guilty while ensuring the dignity and reputation of the security forces," the minister said
	Mr. Ranawaka said they were completely opposed to a UNHRC-proposed hybrid court where the cases would take up according to the international judicial system beyond the local legal system.
	There are several hybrid mechanisms where cases can be taken up. One is to take the cases within the international judicial system beyond the local legal system while the second is to take up the cases under the Sri Lankan judicial system by the foreign experts and the third is to seek foreign advice. We are against any mechanism under the international judicial system, he said.
	The said whatever the mechanism, the inquiry should be carried out under the Sri Lankan constitution and the legal system.
	The minister said there would be no problem in seeking foreign expertise but their impartiality should be considered when doing so.
	Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has done that through the appointment of foreign experts to the Maxwell Paranagama Commission," he said.
	Mr. Ranawaka said it was Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who introduced this hybrid mechanism for the first time in Sri Lanka through the appointment of foreign experts to the Maxwell Paranagama commission.
	The minister the contents of the UN report would have no legal bearing on Sri Lanka and that such reports had been released on previous occasions as well. (Ajith Siriwardana)
