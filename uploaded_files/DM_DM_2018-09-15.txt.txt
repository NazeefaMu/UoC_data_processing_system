Anuja Ranaweera A bank loses a bright spark
	
Last 16th of August I stepped into the Pelawatta branch of Sampath Bank to do a transaction. As I entered the bank I noticed a white flag hoisted above the main entrance.When I made inquiries, I was told something that was astounding and shocking. I was informed that the second officer of the Pelawatta branch had passed away suddenly.How could fate be so cruel to such a gracious young woman 
During the past five years I had developed close ties with her as a customer of the the bank. She was always helpful and gave sound advice whenever I sought her assistance. During a crisis she always had solutions at her fingertips. Once I witnessed how an agitated customer was helped and pacified and how he left the bank with a broad smile after his problem was solved by her. 
She discharged a very unreservedly effective service to the organisation that employed her. She understood the importance of working tirelessly to make the bank shine among other such organisations. 
As a bright product of Matara Sujatha Vidyalaya she excelled in her studies and after joining Sampath Bank, she worked diligently to make it a formidable organisation. 
We express our sincere condolences to her grieving husband and two little kids. 
May she attain nibbana

BETA PEREIRA What an asset she was!
	
Beta was my sister-in-law, married to my brother Aloy. She died recently at the age of 99. Aloy and Beta had no children for the first ten years of their marriage, which took place in 1941. My father was very worried. He was very happy when he got the news that she was pregnant. Then in 1951, Jit was born. Jit has written an appreciation of his mother. I decided I would do the same. 
Beta and I were very close as they lived with us in our parental home for many years, before they decided to move into a house of their own. I do not remember how many years they lived with us, as I am now 92, and my memory is not what it used to be.
Beta and I attended Kathleen La Brooys sewing class together. (which was just a stone throws away from our house at the top of Vajira Road.)When Kathleen suggested I learn to sew a lined coat to wear after tennis, Beta said, Give me the material, and I will sew it for you, as I like to learn it. And she made it for me. Both of us also attended a one-day class by a reputed cookery expert (Mrs Lucian Jansz) on the making of Lamprais, and we then together tried making it at home.
We did much cooking and baking together, including the Portuguese sweet Bolo Fiado, when my brother hinted that we had not made it for a long time.
I remember when my mother had to enter hospital for surgery (strangulated hernia), Beta sewed some bed jackets for her in record time. So she was adept at both cooking and sewing . 
It is only now, after she is gone, do we realise what an asset she was to our family. Yes, I do miss her. May she rest in peace.

CID had no plans to arrest CDS  Govt
	
The government said that CID had no plans to arrest Chief of Defence Staff Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne as claimed by the media.
He was only requested to make a statement regarding the allegations against him, Director General of the Government Information Sudarshana Gunawardena said.
The reports said the arrest was to be made in connection with allegations of the CDS protecting a wanted Navy Officer.
Some of the print and electronic media, saying that a high ranking figure of a security force is to be arrested, was apparently providing publicity to the opinion of the Opposition that the government was on a mission to hunt war heroes, state owned Daily News said quoting Mr. Gunawardena.

DR. SARATH ABEYKOON A Physician of rare quality
	
On September 16, 2017 my dear friend Sarath Abeykoon passed away unexpectedly. I was numbed with shock and grief as I had corresponded with him by email only 5 days ago. I was in Kyoto, Japan attending the World Congress of Neurology. Sarath had trained in Japan and was delighted I was visiting some of the places he had been to. He was a vegetarian, did not smoke and was a teetotaller. He was certainly not overweight and there was no family history of heart disease. The news of his passing away following a heart attack was yet another reality check on the unreliability of life. 
He and I were friends during a long journey which began in 1959 when we entered S.Thomass College, Mt. Lavinia, together. 
His parents, Amara, a Senior Geologist and mother Pauline, were well- known to my family. They were from a neighbouring town, Boralesgamuwa, while we were in Nedimala, Dehiwala. Saraths father had firm views on character building, hence he was boarded at S.Thomass College at the tender age of 7. 
Sarath participated in almost every sport and represented his school in First XI hockey. He also represented the school in basketball, athletics and was the vice captain. 
During his school career he excelled academically winning many prizes and became the Head Prefect of S.Thomas. He went on to win the Victoria Jubilee Gold Medal for the Best All Round Student in his final year at school. I was with him right through his 12 years at S.Thomas. 
He and I then entered Colombo Medical College and University of Ceylon together in 1972 and were batchmates until we qualified as doctors in 1976. At Medical College, Sarath continued where he left off at S.Thomass, excelling at work and participating in all the social activities as well. 
A colleague remembered how the university was heading for a strike which would disrupt final year exams for many faculties as hotheads breathed fire. 
Sarath decided on a career in oncology. He trained in Sri Lankas premier cancer institute at Maharagama. He went for his higher training to Japan and returned to Sri Lanka to work as a cancer specialist within the public health system. What he achieved in those years at Mahragama and later in private, is now stuff of legend, becoming perhaps more known only after his sad demise. He devoted his life to the development of cancer treatment and eventually became the President of the College of Oncologists in Sri Lanka. 
Sarath was of diminutive stature, gentle, unassuming and humble to a fault and always the perfect gentleman. He was charming and likeable and could cope equally comfortably in any group of society. 
At a time when Sri Lankas medical profession is being increasingly viewed with unhappiness and skepticism, that financial gain at the expense of a quality service is seen as the driving force, Sarath was again a shining example for the medical profession, patients and society at large. He exemplified the goodness of a committed, compassionate physician who encompassed the real meaning and tenets of the Hippocratic Oath, the guiding light through the ages for the Noble Profession. 
As mentioned above, I have had the rare privilege of having had a ringside seat to such an inspiring and exemplary life. He was a dear friend and the groomsman at my wedding to my wife, Priyani. 
Sarath led an exemplary Buddhist life, devoting the richness of his life to help others less fortunate. 
Simply stated, he was one of Sri Lankas rarest gems. 
May his journey through Sams<U+0227>ra be short. 
Nothing beautiful in this world
Is ever really lost
All things beloved
Live in our hearts
Forever.

Fires, explosions erupt in multiple US towns near Boston
	

NEW YORK AFP Sept14, 2018- A teenager was killed and 12 others were injured after a problem in a gas line caused dozens of explosions and fires in the Boston suburbs. 
Thousands of people were evacuated as up to 70 fires started burning in Lawrence, Andover and North Andover on Thursday afternoon because of a problem with the natural gas system. 
Andover Fire Chief Michael Mansfield said it looked like Armageddon, with decimated homes and so much smoke you couldnt see the sky. 
Authorities said Leonel Rondon, 18, of Lawrence, died after a chimney toppled by an exploding house crashed into his car. He was rushed to a Boston hospital but pronounced dead there in the evening. 
Firefighters from some 50 different fire departments have been working to douse the flames. 
Ten people have been hurt, including one firefighter in Andover. Town officials said two civilians in Andover were also injured. 
In Lawrence, at least four people were said to be undergoing treatment at Lawrence General Hospital as of Thursday night.

## Title: Guatemalan genocide and its aftermath

Guatemalan genocide and its aftermath
	

In 1981 on the editorial page of the New York Times I wrote a column showing that the mass atrocities against the Indian population of Guatemala were carried out under the direct orders of the then president, Fernando Lucas Garcia. His former vice-president, Francisco Villagran Kramer, had given me information that was incontrovertible evidence of the murders.
I also showed how close was the relationship, financially and militarily, between the Guatemalan government and President Ronald Reagans government. At the time Regan was considered to be the Teflon President. No scandal stuck to him. Certainly not the evidence of a column in the New York Times. The reaction in Washington was zero. A brief while later Amnesty International published a long report documenting an act of genocide. 
After a number of changes of government in Guatemala, President Efrain Rios Montt came to power. Reagans Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights, Elliott Abrams, wrote that President Efrain Rios Montts rule had brought considerable progress on human rights. He also declared that the amount of killings of innocent civilians is being reduced step by step. In fact it was the reverse. 
It was not until 1996 under President Alvaro Arzu that the death squads run by the army and the government were finally dismantled. Nearly 40 years later, in 2013, Montt was convicted in court of genocide and sentenced to prison for 80 years. It was the first time that a former head of state had been found guilty of genocide by a court in his own country. Prosecutors said that he had presided over the wars bloodiest phase. 
Under Reagan, embassy officials had trekked up to the scene of massacres and reported back to Washington the armys line that the guerrillas were doing the killing. According to de-classified diplomatic cables, over the next two years US$15 million in vehicles, spare parts and arms from the US reached the Guatemalan military. There was military training too. Congress re-imposed the ban (the first was done by Jimmy Carter) in 1990 but clandestine aid continued unknown to President Carter. More military aid came from such allies as Taiwan, Israel, Argentina and Chile. (The latter two ruled by military dictatorships that were carrying out terrible human rights abuses themselves.) 
Progress has been made, yet most of the time at a snail-like pace. The murder of Indians has stopped. However, other problems abound. Only last week President Jimmy Morales, who was not involved in the genocide, said that the head of a UN anti-corruption mission (partly funded by the US) would not be allowed back into Guatemala. For some time allegations of corruption have swirled around Moraless family. As recently as this May seven human rights activists were murdered, although it is not suggested that Morales is behind them. 
The first real turning point was the work of President Alvaro Arzu. The second was the appointment of Claudia Paz y Paz as Attorney-General, by President Alvaro Colom, the countrys first left-leaning president in 53 years. A former human rights lawyer, aged only 44, she was a no-nonsense woman who put a number of notorious drug dealers and human rights criminals behind bars, and indicted Rios Montt. Her rigorous policies helped lower the horrendous crime rate, one of the worlds three worst. Forbes magazine described her as one of the five most powerful women changing the world. 
She was helped by the total turn around of Washingtons long-time policy, thanks to President Bill Clinton. In March 1999 on a visit to Guatemala Clinton made a public apology: For the United States, it is important that I state clearly that support for military forces and intelligence units which engaged in violence and widespread repression was wrong. It led the Washington Post to editorialize, We Americans need our own Truth Commission. 
She was also helped by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights that had ruled in 2004 that genocide had occurred and that the Rios Montt regime was responsible for it. Also an international arrest warrant had been issued by a Spanish judge in 2006. Both these events had helped change the political and judicial atmosphere. 
Surprisingly, Rios Montt barely mentioned the United States when he put forward his arguments in his defence. But, as the New York Times reported , Washingtons alliance with him was not forgotten in the giant vaulted room where the current American ambassador, Arnold Chacon, sat as a spectator in a show of support for the trial. (Chacon was appointed by the Administration of Barack Obama.) 
Under President Donald Trump very few appear to be concerned about Guatemala. That doesnt mean nothing is going on between Washington and Guatemala. It just means that the media seemed to have lost interest until last weeks story. Will the Trump Administration support the cause of law and anti-corruption or will it just let things be 
Over the years, as a foreign affairs columnist of the International Herald Tribune, I have made four visits to Guatemala. Please see my website: jonathanpowerjournalist.com e-mail:jonatpower@aol.com

Kandiah Pathmanathan Easwaranathan The banking sector will greatly miss him
	
Late Mr. Kandiah Pathmanathan Easwaranathan hails from Karainagar Jaffna. He did his schooling at Royal College, Colombo. Having completed his schooling at Colombo Royal his ambition was to join the banking industry. 
He was very keen on joining Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC and he applied to Commercial Bank and did well in the interviews. Without any influence he joined the Bank in December 1982. 
His first appointment was at the Head Office where he gained experience in all sectors of banking during his initial tenure of 6 years from 1982 to 1988. 
In 1988 he was transferred to the Wellawatte branch. There were only two State Banks and two Private Banks at Wellawatte, when he assumed duties.

During his tenure of 11 years at Wellawatte from 1988 to 1999, he was able to work efficiently in all areas with the experience he gained at the Head Office.
He was very cordial and friendly with the customers and guided the junior staff whenever they needed help

However now there are 18 banks alone as well as other finance companies, foreign currency exchange offices, pawning centres, etc. amounting to 20 outlets, thus totaling 38 units.

During his tenure of 11 years at Wellawatte from 1988 to 1999, he was able to work efficiently in all areas with the experience he gained at the Head Office. He was very cordial and friendly with the customers and guided the junior staff whenever they needed help. 
Then in 1999 he was transferred back from Welawatte branch to Corporate Branch of Commercial Bank. There he was able to gain more experience in areas he had not worked earlier and he also worked as Manager in some Divisions in the Corporate Branch.
He worked there from 1999 to 2011 again for another 11 years and then he was transferred back to Wellawatte Branch in the capacity of Senior Manager in 2011. 
When he took office as Senior Manager at Commercial Bank, Wellawatte, the customers and the staff were very happy with his return and the business flourished. He was the only person as a Senior Manager amongst the other Senior Managers who held office, to have this special rapport with both customers as well as staff and it was during his period that the new 7 storey building of Commercial Bank was opened in Wellawatte in December 2016 having extended working hours till 8.00 pm and housing three Regional offices, Digital banking, Development credit banking and other facilities. 
He was also very close with the board of directors and helped in achieving the target for the branch until his retirement in mid March 2017.
His retirement came voluntarily backed by the intention of giving opportunities to the younger generation to grow further. 
His father, Mr. Kandiah Pathmanathan, was also a retired state banker. 
On 25th July 2018, he went to Commercial Bank Head Office to wish Mr. Jegan Durairatnam, who was retiring as MD/CEO and to congratulate Mr. Renganathan who was taking over that position and participated in the events of the day. The same evening he suffered a heart attack and passed away. 
May his soul rest in peace.

Life-threatening  storm lashes US coast
	

Hurricane Florence battered the Carolinas early Friday with howling winds, life-threatening storm surges and torrential rains as it edged closer to the coast in what officials warned is a once in a lifetime event.
Reports said coastal streets in North Carolina were flooded and winds bent trees to the ground as the storm, which has been downgraded to Category 1 and is weakened and slower moving than in recent days, prepared to make landfall at some point on Friday.
More than 150,000 customers in North Carolina were reported to be without power as the outer band of the storm approached.
Footage from US TV outlets showed raging waters hitting piers and jettys and rushing across coastal roads in seaside communities.
The National Hurricane Center in Miami reported life-threatening storm surge and hurricane-force winds along the North Carolina coast.
In its 0600 GMT advisory, the center said Florence was over the Atlantic Ocean about 35 miles east of Wilmington, North Carolina and moving northwest at six miles per hour (10 kilometers per hour).
It added that the maximum sustained winds were 90 miles per hour. Florence is now at the weakest of five categories on the Saffir-Simpson scale.
In a display of the early effects of the storm, one flood gauge on the Neuse River in New Bern, North Carolina, showed 10 feet (three meters) of flooding, the NHC said.

Martin Wickramasinghe  and his work of art
	
Martin Wickramasinghe was born on May 29, 1892. According to the era he lived in, it was surprising that he criticised witchcraft. He believed that witchcraft was misleading people and leading them on to a gloomy path. He said that people shun medical consultations for their dreadful diseases. What was appealing to them was the work of witch doctors, because science was not much popular in every nook and corner of the country during that period unlike today.

People believe in witch doctors and their rituals. Wickramasinghe showed the correct path by opening their eyes through his first novel Leela. It was published in 1914. He argued with these witch doctors. In is novels Wickramasinghe explores the human mind. His arguments were very strong and to the point. He was a free-thinker not an extremist. The readers get a taste of what true love is by reading about characters like Soma, Seetha, Iranganee, Rohini, Miriguwa, Unmada Chithtra. After gaining scientific knowledge what the reader should read is works like Sathva Sanththiya and Grameeya Vidya Praveeshaya. These are useful for students who study biology. 

Reality is Wickramasinghes main theme in his writings. He has stayed away from what cant be believed. Wickramasinghe introduced scientificthinking for writers associated with Sinhala Literature

His novel, Viragaya, is one of the most critical novels produced by a Sri Lankan. Even a qualified psychiatrist may not be able to write a novel like Viragaya. It includes psychological facts. Wickramasinghe conveyed details about some morals to readers. These were associated with the human body and mind. He presented them scientifically and artistically in Viragaya. The main character in Viragaya, Aravinda, fell in trouble and at last he died owing to his unnatural neutralised behavior patterns, which highlighted his sedentary life. He disregards normal customs, ethics in the human life. 
His world was confined to himself. Aravinda was confined to bed and he did little physical exercises. His death was linked to a biological result. Being unable to take a decision regarding his love. Depicting Aravindas character, Wickramasinghe has underscored significant psychological theories. Wickramasinghe proved his genius by inventing characters with subtle feelings. 
Gamperaliya, Kaliyugaya and Yuganthaya highlight the social changes in the Sri Lankan society. Piyal in Gamperaliya is a symbol of manifesting the feudal society into capitalist Society. That is the conversion of feudal era to capitalist era. Wickramasinghe predicted the social changes to take place in Sri Lanka. 
Reality is Wickramasinghes main theme in his writings. He has stayed away from what cant be believed. Wickramasinghe introduced scientific thinking for writers associated with Sinhala Literature. 

On principle Wickramasinghe excluded dishonesty, fake and falsehood from his scripts. In Apegama, he severely criticised fake and dishonest people

He wrote some books in English like Buddhist Jataka Stories, Aspects of Sinhalese Culture, Buddhism and Culture, Revolution and Evolution, Buddhism and Arts and Mysticism of Lawrence. 
On principle Wickramasinghe excluded dishonesty, fake and falsehood from his scripts. In Apegama, he severely criticised fake and dishonest people by criticising characters in the likes of Notharis Appu and Daniel Veda Mahattaya for deceiving an innocent person like Koranelis Appu. 
Pavukarayata Galgaseema, Wahallu, Magulgedara, Ape Vitthi, Mage Kathawa, Hada Sakki Keema are some of his short-story books. In Pavukarayata Galgaseema, the writer suggests that there should be sympathy for the sinner and not to attack him, but attack the sin. 
His excellent philosophical knowledge helped Wickramasinghe write Budusamaya Saha Samajadarshanaya, Buddhadarshanaya Saha Margaya Bavatharanya, etc. They included themes in Buddhist philosophy. His philosophy revolved around ideological materialism and not idealism. 
He is a philosopher. It is indisputable. He wrote Bavatharanaya at the age of 83. Wickramasinghe travelled on a different path from his contemporary writers. That is reality. 
All his works of art highlight morals and and offer valuable lessons to the present society.

Rajapaksa Family Politics and Gotabayas Presidential Candidacy
	
Another option is to announce a candidate acceptable to all
The 19th Constitutional amendment reversed the 18th constitutional amendment by restricting the Presidential terms of office to two

By
D.B.S. Jeyaraj
Former Sri Lankan president Mahinda Rajapaksas interview to the influential Indian English daily The Hindu has caused quite a splash among political circles in Sri Lanka. The ex- president was interviewed by Suhasini Haidar and Amit Baruah for the newspaper which has acquired a reputation over the years of being the most authoritative voice on Sri Lanka related issues in the Indian media. Incidentally Suhasini Haidar is the daughter of maverick Indian politician Dr. Subramanian Swamy who displays consistent interest in the affairs of the Island nation. She is the diplomatic affairs and deputy resident editor of The Hindu in New Delhi. Suhasini whose forte is international relations has frequently complemented the efforts of Meera Srinivasan the current Colombo Correspondent of The Hindu in reporting on Sri Lanka. Amit Baruah too is an old Sri Lanka hand having worked as the newspapers Colombo correspondent earlier. He is now the resident editor of The Hindu  in New Delhi. It could be seen therefore that the Mahinda Rajapaksa interview was conducted by high-powered journalists who were well-informed about Sri Lanka.
Just as the sting of a scorpion is in its tail, the explosive impact of the interview was at the tail-end. Though the detailed interview possessed many interesting dimensions, what stirred the Sri Lankan political imagination were the two questions and answers at the end of the interview pertaining to the forthcoming presidential elections and the choices before Mahinda Rajapaksa, the questions and answers were as follows: 

QWho will lead the SLPP into elections in 2019, given that you have completed two terms and according to the 19th Amendment that is the limit
(MR) I will lead the SLPP. There is a view that despite the Amendment I can fight elections and then fight it out in court.
But I still have to decide whether to take that risk. Another option is to announce a candidate acceptable to all.

QWill it be a member of your family, or would you consider someoneoutside it
(MR) My son [Namal Rajapaksa] cant be a presidential candidate since they have now raised the minimum age to 35 years, instead of 30, so he cant be considered in 2019. My brother is certainly a contender, but the party and the coalition will have to decide who the people want.

Mahindas Mindset
Mahindas response to the queries revealed the present mindset of the man known as the Medamulana Machiavelli on the crucial question of who would be fielded as the joint opposition candidate at the next presidential elections. Since consistency is not necessarily a virtue in politics and also because politics is always regarded as the art of the possible these views may very well change at a different time. At present however the answers encapsulate Mahindas thoughts on the matters concerned. The essence of his answers can be broken down and placed in perspective in the following manner.
Firstly Mahinda Rajapaksa would lead and spearhead the electoral campaign on behalf of the Sri Lanka PoduJana Party (SLPP). An answer to an earlier question indicates that there would be no partnership with the Maithripala Sirisena-led Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). The only seemingly available option for Sirisena-led SLFP is to join up and merge with the SLPP.
Secondly Mahinda is yet undecided on whether he should contest presidential elections notwithstanding the 19th Constituional Amendment. There are some in the Mahinda camp who opine that the ex-president could contest again. The two options being toyed with are either to seek an early ruling from the Supreme Court on this issue or to wait for the poll, be nominated as a candidate and then fight it out in courts seeking a favourable decision from the judiciary. This however amounts to political brinkmanship and Mahinda faced with a Hamlet-like dilemma keeps pondering on whether to take the risk or not. Mahinda makes it clear that the decision will be his and his alone.
Thirdly there is the other choice of nominating another person as the candidate. Given the very solid opinion expressed by several reputed legal eagles that the 19th Amendment conclusively debars Mahinda from throwing his hat into the presidential poll ring, this alternative choice could be perceived as virtual Hobsons choice. Interestingly Mahinda places a caveat. He says Another option is to announce a candidate acceptable to all. What this means is that the candidate should be acceptable to all shades of opinion within party folds as well as the voting constituency. What is left unsaid here is that a controversial person who is unacceptable to a broad spectrum and may cause divisions cannot be the candidate.
Fourthly is the reply to the query as to whether the prospective candidate would be a member of the (Rajapaksa) family or someone outside it. Mahindas answer has many layers to it but what is of great significance is what he did not say. He simply ignored the part about a potential candidate outside the family. What this implies is that whatever the problems or squabbles within the Rajapaksa clan, the ultimate choice would be a family member. This rules out the potential candidacy of joint opposition leader Dinesh Gunawardena and the political hallucination of Maithripala Sirisena that he could be the common candidate of a joint opposition SLPP-SLFP combine.
Fifthly it appears that Mahindas first thought is of Namal Rajapaksa alone when the question of a family member being a candidate is posed to him. Mahinda the brother does not think of his siblings first but Mahinda the father first thinks of his eldest son only. He laments the fact that the 19th Constitutional Amendment has raised the age limit of a presidential candidate to 35. Namal born on April 10, 1986 will only be 33 in 2019. This rules out the eldest son and political heir-apparent Namal Rajapaksa as a presidential candidate. Since the other two sons Yoshita and Rohitha are even more younger than Namal there is no way that the presidential candidacy could be given to a son of Mahinda. The next choice therefore is a brother of Mahinda.

Contender BrotherSixth is the question of a brother of Mahinda being a contender. Mahinda says in the interview My brother is certainly a contender, but the party and the coalition will have to decide who the people want. This brings up the question of who the contender brother is because no name is specifically mentioned Since former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa is already in the running for the presidential candidacy stakes it has been automatically assumed that the reference was to Gota. Doubts were raised in circles hostile to Gota that Mahinda had referred to his elder brother Chamal as the contender because both younger brothers Gotabaya and Basil are dual citizens with US citizenship and are therefore ineligible to contest under the 19A.
In order to clarify this point I contacted Suhasini Haider who along with Amit Baruah interviewed Mahinda in New Delhi. I asked her whether Mahinda had mentioned the name of any one explicitly when saying my brother is a contender. Suhasini replied I dont think so, but everyone assumed the conversation was about Gota. She kindly checked her recording of the interview and reverted back to me. Suhasini said that in her question she had mentioned your brother to which Mahinda had replied my brother is certainly a contender. It appears therefore that neither the journalists nor Mahinda had specifically named any brother but it was implicitly understood by both parties that the brother reference was to Gotabaya Rajapaksa.

In order to clarify this point I contacted Suhasini Haider who along with Amit Baruah interviewed Mahinda in New Delhi. I asked her whether Mahinda had mentioned the name of any one explicitly when saying my brother is a contender

Seventh and finally is the question of Gotabaya Rajapaksa being a contender for the presidential candidacy. As stated earlier no name was specifically mentioned but it is understood and accepted that the brother contender reference is to Gota. What is important to note is that Mahinda does not endorse Gota or anyone else for that matter and instead lays down what could be termed as conditions. He says, My brother is certainly a contender, but the party and the coalition will have to decide who the people want. In replying to the earlier question Mahinda said, Another option is to announce a candidate acceptable to all. 
What this means is that the prospective candidate must be acceptable to a broad constituency and that the decision on a candidate must be endorsed by the Pohottuwa party and the joint opposition coalition. It is illuminating that Mahinda steadfastly refrains from publicly naming his ex-defence secretary sibling as the candidate despite strenuous efforts by the pro-Gota lobby. In this instance the stipulated conditions are double-edged as far as Gotabaya Rajapaksa is concerned. Will Gota be endorsed by all shades of opinion in the SLPP and joint opposition Gota may be acceptable to a large number of Sinhala Buddhists but will he be acceptable to substantial segments of the religious and ethnic minority communities in the Island If the answers are positive then the presidential candidacy of Gotabaya Rajapaksa is a certainty. If the answers are negative then there can be no firm decision on Gota being the chosen candidate. This prolongs the state of uncertainty. The result can only be compounded confusion.

Medamulana Dynasty
All this brings us back to the succession stakes issue within the Ruhunu Rajapaksa clan. The Medamulana Dynasty in this clan comprises the family members of former State Councillor and Parliamentarian Don Alvin (DA) Rajapaksa namely Mahinda Rajapaksa and his brothers Chamal, Basil and Gotabaya along with Mahindas son Namal and Chamals son Shasheendra. Although the Ruhunu Rajapaksa family has been in politics for several decades starting from the days of the State Council, its ascendancy to the pinnacle of power came only in the new millennium. This became possible only after Percy Mahendra Rajapaksa, known to his country and the world at large as Mahinda Rajapaksa, became Sri Lankas fifth Executive President on November 18, 2005. 
Thereafter, the Rajapaksas established themselves rapidly as the numero uno family in Sri Lankan politics. Apart from Mahinda Rajapaksa as President, family members and extended family members monopolised plum positions. Various posts in different spheres -- from Defence Secretary to diplomatic representative -- were held by the clan. Some were elected to office while others were appointed. Some proved their capability by efficiently discharging their duties while others failed miserably demonstrating the negativity of nepotism. 
During the days of the Rajapaksa regime it was an open secret that no major enterprise or project could be undertaken in the island without the blessings of at least one Rajapaksa. In those days most movers and shakers in Sri Lankan society derived their power and energy from the Rajapaksa generator. Opposition members alleged then that nearly 70% of the National Budget was controlled directly by the Rajapaksa siblings. Family bandyism was a way of life under the Rajapaksa dispensation.
Mahinda Rajapaksa was an MP from 1970 to 77 and 1989 to 1994. He first tasted ministerial office in 1994. The 1994 elections saw the Peoples Alliance forming a government. Chandrika Kumaratunga became Prime Minister and later President. Mahinda was first appointed as the Labour Minister and later Fisheries Minister in a Cabinet reshuffle. In 2001, the UNP formed the government while Chandrika continued to be President. Mahinda Rajapaksa became leader of the opposition. In 2004, the UPFA formed the government and Mahinda became Prime Minister. In 2005, the presidential election was announced. Despite many intra-party obstacles, Mahinda Rajapaksa secured nomination as the presidential candidate in the November 2005 elections. The Tiger  enforced boycott in the North and the East in 2005 helped Mahinda defeat Ranil in the presidential poll. 
Thereafter the Rajapaksa regime pursued the war against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) with ruthless determination. After many deaths and much displacement, destruction and despair, the war ended with the military defeat of the LTTE in May 2009. The Rajapaksas cleverly converted the war-victory euphoria into political victories in the 2010 Presidential and Parliamentary elections. The Ruhunu Rajapaksas perceived as the first family in Sri Lankan politics began ruling the roost in an authoritarian mode. With the 18th Constitutional Amendment being passed, the two-term limit for contesting Presidential elections was removed. It appeared that the politically-invincible Mahinda Rajapaksa was set to rule Sri Lanka for life as President. 

Maithripala Sirisena
When presidential elections were called ahead of time, party secretary and senior Cabinet minister Maithripala Sirisena defected and became the common opposition candidate. The January 2015 Presidential poll resulted in Maithripala Sirisena (51.28%) defeating Mahinda Rajapaksa (47.58%). A UNP-led coalition government was formed with Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister and Maithripala Sirisena as President. The 19th Constitutional Amendment re-imposing the two-term limit for the Presidency was passed. With Mahinda Rajapaksa being Constitutionally-debarred from contesting the presidency again, it appeared that the political fortunes of Ruhunu Rajapaksas were on the wane. A number of inquiries probing the alleged corruption and abuse of power by various Rajapaksa family members were initiated. Cases were filed in court and a few Rajapaksas like Basil and Namal were even imprisoned for short periods. Gotabaya Rajapaksa continues to wage many legal battles to ward off arrest and potential detention. 
In such a situation, many political observers felt that the writing was on the wall politically for the Ruhunu Rajapaksas. But that did not happen. Despite the adverse setbacks, the political stock of Ruhunu Rajapaksas continues to remain on par with Medamulana Mahinda continuing to retain his position as the single-most popular political leader in the seven provinces outside the North and the East. Moreover, the newly-formed Sri Lanka Podujana Party (SLPP) which revolves around Mahinda Rajapaksa has got the better of both the UNP and SLFP and emerged as the leading victor at the local authorities elections. 
Against that backdrop the Mahinda-led opposition seems confident that the days of the government are numbered and that the political resurgence and return to power of the Ruhunu Rajapaksas is inevitable. The Rajapaksa camp asserts boldly that either Mahinda or a suitable person nominated by him would be at the helm of Sri Lankan affairs soon. Speculation is rife that Gotabaya Rajapaksa endorsed and supported by Mahinda would contest and win the presidency. In spite of these rosy expectations the ground reality within the Rajapaksa camp was troubling. The main reason being the triple blows dealt by the 19th Constitutional amendment.
The 19th Constitutional amendment reversed the 18th constitutional amendment by restricting the Presidential terms of office to two. Since Mahinda Rajapaksa had served two terms as President he was disqualified from contesting the Presidential elections again. This was the first blow. The 19th Amendment also debarred dual citizens from contesting Presidential and parliamentary polls. This rendered Mahindas brothers Basil and Gotabaya ineligible to contest. This was the second blow. 19A also raised the age limit to be President. Earlier it was 30 but now it was 35. Mahindas eldest son Namal Rajapaksa was born in 1986. As such he would only be 33 next year and therefore cant seek the presidency even if he wanted to. This was the third blow.
Still there were many silver linings in the dark clouds. Chamal stated that he was not interested in the presidency. Basil indicated that he was not willing to give up his US citizenship thus ruling himself out of the presidential candidacy race. Gotabaya however was willing to renounce his US citizenship and contest the presidential poll if nominated as a candidate. Some of Mahindas political minions began exploring the possibility of making Mahinda Prime Minister with executive powers. With the newly formed SLPP winning splendidly at the local authority polls it appeared that any candidate with Mahindas backing could romp home the winner in the presidential stakes,

House of the Rajapaksas
This rising tide of optimism within the Rajapaksa camp also started ebbing with distressing news of simmering tensions within the Rajapaksa extended family. Much of this was due to the 19 A ill- effect it was felt. In the absence of Mahinda who among the Rajapaksas could contest the presidential elections was the 18 Billion Dollar question. Sri Lankans with political animal instincts began indulging themselves in the engaging pastime of Rajapaksa watching. Real or imaginary movements within the house of the Rajapaksas caused quite a buzz. Speculation was rife and the rumour mills began working overtime.The political grapevine began humming with sensational dollops of news about dissension and divisions. It was as if the Rajapaksa family was tearing itself apart over the Presidential candidacy stakes.
It was against this gloomy backdrop that the Pater Familias of the DA Rajapaksa family initiated a proactive move to resolve differences and forge unity. Though Mahinda is the most powerful and influential member of the family he is not the head of the family according to socio-cultural norms. In the absence of parents that honour goes to the eldest son in the family. Chamal Jayantha Rajapaksa born on October 30, 1942 is the eldest of Don Alvin and Dona Dandina Rajapaksas nine children comprising six boys and three girls. Mahinda is the third child.

the Mahinda-led opposition seems confident that the days of the government are numbered and that the political resurgence and return to power of the Ruhunu Rajapaksas is inevitable

Chamal Rajapaksa arranged for a meeting of the Rajapaksa siblings in late March this year. The meeting was held at the residence of one of DA Rajapaksas daughters . The Rajapaksa brothers and sisters converged at the venue without their spouses or offspring being present. The objective of the family conclave was to unanimously select an alternative to Mahinda to contest the Presidential elections. The selected candidate would contest polls and hopefully win the elections. Thereafter he would take steps to transfer power back to Mahinda Rajapaksa. The methodology for this would be devised at the appropriate juncture depending upon the prevailing political circumstances and environment. Until such a transfer of power is effected the chosen candidate would abide by Mahinda and be guided by him.
Chamal Rajapaksa declined to be the chosen candidate. Basil also opted out. This left Gotabaya who like the Dickensian Barkis was willin. Gota said that he would renounce his US citizenship in due course and that the entire process would not take more than two to three months at the most. Basil also extended his support to Gota and said that he would help him run the Govt if elected. It was agreed that Mahinda would remain head of the party while Gotabhaya would be the presidential candidate.Mahinda also said that it would be premature to announce the candidacy now and said he would do so when the time was conducive. This was agreed upon.

Gotabayas Candidacy
Thereafter the Rajapaksa family demonstrated through their actions that they were closing ranks. Mahinda and Basil visited Gotabayas Viyathmaga office publicly. Gota reciprocated by visiting the SLPP party headquarters officially. The Rajapaksa siblings also re-iterated in media interviews that there was no dissension among them. Everything seemed hunky-dory and it seemed to be only a matter of time before Mahinda would officially announce Gotabayas presidential candidacy.

But then as the Scottish poet Robert Burns observed, The best laid plans of men and mice and men often go awry. Likewise something seemed to have gone wrong with the Rajapaksa family plans and there was soon discord. The family consensus on a presidential candidate does not appear to be valid any more.It appears that Gotabhaya is being opposed within family circles.Mahinda Rajapaksas interview with The Hindu newspaper strengthens this impression further. What then could have caused this state of affairs The possible answers to this question would be explored in a forthcoming article.

The agricultural ministry had signed an agreement with China in 2016 to export more than 10,000 tons of bananas but it had failed to export at least a kilo of bananas after two years, former Agricultural Ministry Additional Secretary Dr. Subaheenkenda said yesterday.
He told Daily Mirror that according to the agreement, the agricultural ministry was to send a list of 150 banana cultivators to the Chinese government and added that however, it had failed to prepare a list as yet.
According to the agreement, Chinese government had ordered Ambun, Ambul and Kolikuttu varieties from Sri Lanka.
When asked about the matter, agricultural ministry secretary B. Wijeratne said the ministry could not supply the varieties demanded by China and said they were still studying the matter.
Dr. Subaheenkenda said the Chinese government had agreed to provide market opportunities for papaw, pineapple, mango and Rambutan as well. (Indika Sri Aravinda)

SL diplomat arrested in Italy for aiding illegal migration
	
The officers of the Malpensa Airport Border Police Bureau, Milan, Italy arrested a Sri Lankan diplomat who attempted to bring four youths into Italy by aiding illegal migration last weekend, Italy's Varese7press reported.
The male, a fifty-year-old diplomat who arrived from Doha together with his wife and four others -- two girls and two boys of around twenty years, presented himself as a diplomat to the Immigration officials to be able to access the station dedicated to the verification of documents of Community passengers, at that time free.
Having obtained the authorization from the immigration officer, the diplomat approached handing over the passports of the entire group; after showing his diplomatic passport, which had a Schengen visa issued by the French diplomatic authority, he showed the passport of his wife, who also holds a diplomatic passport in possession of a similar Schengen visa. Continuing with the verification of documents, the attention of the State Police operator was attracted by the doubtful authenticity of the passports of the four youths , with similar Schengen visas.
The diplomat to reassure the border officer , said to go to France for tourism, presenting the two girls as their daughters and the two boys as nephews, stating that they would continue the journey by train. As proof of his version, the diplomatic agent showed the air tickets where it appeared that the group would leave the Paris airport on 12 September.
Not at all influenced by the role of the diplomat, the supervisor invited the entire group to follow him to the immigration office , where the two girls expressing themselves in English confirmed the version of the diplomat claiming to be his daughters.
From a deep investigation carried out by personnel expert in false documents, it was observed that all four ordinary passports of the youths were falsified through the reconstruction of the biographical page, made using raw materials and sophisticated printing techniques.
In the hand baggage of the investigated diplomat, the authentic passports of the four young Sinhalese used at Colombo airport to leave Sri Lanka were found hidden in the cover.
The four young people have admitted that they have no kinship with the diplomat who, on the contrary, at the request of their parents, had pledged, behind the consideration of 4,000 euros each, to accompany them in France where other relatives lived. The boys also stated that they had received instructions from their agents to behave like a normal family and that any request from the border officers would have to confirm that they were daughters and grandchildren respectively. During the checks it was revealed that the falsified passports are those of the real sons of the diplomat.
According to the Assistant Police Chief of the Republic of Busto Arsizio Dr. Massimo De Pillippo after having ascertained through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the diplomatic agent is not accredited to the State of Italy, the Sri Lankan official was arrested for the crime of facilitating illegal immigration and produced him to the judicial authority.
The wife with the four young men were all pushed back to the border and boarded into a direct flight to Sri Lanka.

World democracy under strain; lets find the solution
	
Today is the United Nations International Day of Democracy and the theme for the year is appropriate for most of the world  Democracy under Strain: Solutions for a Changing World. Obviously the United States President Donald Trump - with his impulsive and dangerously unpredictable if not idiotic decisions, is one of the main causes for this. 
The UN says this event is an opportunity to look for ways to invigorate democracy and seek answers to the systemic challenges it faces. This includes tackling economic and political inequalities, making democracies more inclusive by bringing the young and marginalized into the political system, and making democracies more innovative and responsive to emerging challenges such as migration and climate change. Again though the UN does not say it Donald Trump appears to be the main threat to the free world order - as exposed in the best selling book of famous journalist Bob Woodward. 
With this years 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Day of Democracy is also an opportunity to highlight the values of freedom and respect for human rights as essential elements of democracy. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that the will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government (article 21.3), has inspired constitution-making around the world and contributed to global acceptance of democratic values and principles. Democracy, in turn, provides the natural environment for the protection and effective realization of human rights. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development addresses democracy in Sustainable Development Goal 16, recognizing the indivisible links between peaceful societies and effective, accountable and inclusive institutions. 
UN Secretary General Antnio Guterres in a message says working for a future that leaves no one behind requires us to consider essential, pressing questions. For example, what impact will migration or climate change have on democracy in the next generation How do we best harness the potential of new technologies while avoiding the dangers How do we build better governance so that democracy delivers better lives and fully meets the publics aspirations Mr. Guterres has called on the world to join forces for the future of democracy. He needs to address these questions mainly to Mr. Trump. In Sri Lanka there was wide-spread hope that the January 8, 2015 presidential election would be a turning point towards the restoration of democracy, the rule of law and effective measures to bring about a just, peaceful and all inclusive society. Some three years and nine months later, there are differing views on how far we have progressed in achieving these noble objectives. 
Democracy has been restored to a large extent with checks and balances among the executive, the legislature, the judiciary and the free media. These are widely accepted as the four pillars of democracy. After the August 2015 parliamentary election, the two main parties  the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP)  decided to form a coalition government. A three year memorandum of understanding was signed after the August 2015 parliamentary election. The coalition still continues despite regular divisions and disputes, which generally take place when two parties come together though they have different socio economic viewpoints. 
On the positive side an independent, all party Constitutional Council was setup to confirm appointments to high places and oversee the work of the independent Public Services Commission, the Police Commission, the Judicial Services Commission, the National Elections Commission, the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), and the Human Rights Commission. 
The new government had pledged to investigate allegations that the former Rajapaksa regimes leaders, top officials and their lackeys had plundered billions of dollars in public funds and deposited the money in secret foreign bank accounts. But it took about three and a half years for the government to implement legislation to setup special Permanent High Courts, which are conducting trials-at-bar into such corruption allegations. Hearings will be held daily in the morning and afternoon while it is hoped that the cases could be concluded within a few months. Two such cases - one involving the former Defense Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa - have already been taken up and more are to follow with the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) and the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) having gathered substantial evidence in about 100 cases. 
As for sustainable, eco-friendly and all inclusive development, the government is implementing three major projects - Gamperaliya or village reawakening, Enterprise Sri Lanka and the Grama Shakthi projects. Government leaders say they hope to provide about a million jobs mainly to village youth, who are creative, innovative or enterprising. They are being given big, interest free bank loans to start enterprises with their targets including the export market. We hope the vision of the just, peaceful and all inclusive society could be reached in this way with politicians sincerely, selflessly and sacrificially serving the people.
