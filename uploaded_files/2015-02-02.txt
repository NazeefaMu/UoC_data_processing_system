Video: JVP complains against SLC
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today lodged a complaint with the Bribery Commission against former Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Sri Lanka Cricket Secretary Nishantha Ranatunga and the Cricket Board on 25 incidents of allegations including misuse of Board positions and other frauds. ?
The party also charged the Cricket Executive Committee and Interim Managing Committee of the same allegations.
?JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti charged Mr. Ranatunga had appeared as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Cricket Board though he was only the secretary.
?Mr. Ranatunga received all the blessings from the former government to continue to function as the secretary as well as the CEO. This is a grave violation of laws. Mr. Ranatunga held a major role in Mihin Lanka as well as in the SLC. The broadcasting of cricket matches was also given to a private channel, in which again he was the CEO, without a proper procedure,? charged Mr. Handunnetti.
He also alleged the funds of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority had been used for the construction of the International Cricket stadium at Sooriyawewa in Hambantota.
?The action of the Cricket officials had an effect on the performance of the talented cricketers. If these officials continue to function, it will be detrimental for the wellbeing of Sri Lanka cricket.? We requested the new sports minister a meeting to discuss the problems in the SLC but so far we didn?t receive a reply,? he said. (Sanath Desmond and Lahiru Pothmulla)

Mohan Peiris to create public opinion
	
	Subsequent to President Maithripala Sirisena?s recommendation that the appointment of Mohan Peiris as the Chief Justice was null and void, President?s Counsel Mohan Peiris was expecting to bring the issue through the Parliament and create a public opinion, sources close to Mr. Peiris said yesterday.
	In a letter sent by Secretary to President P.B. Abeykoon on January 28 to Mohan Peiris PC, Mr. Peiris was informed that his appointment was null and void from its inception.
	Sources said since the act of an incumbent President cannot be challenge before Court, Mr. Peiris was expecting to bring the issue before Parliament.
	?The President has acted in an irresponsible manner in contrary to the law. This issue could also bring an impeachment against the President,? the source said. ?
	Meanwhile, issuing a statement to media Mr. Peiris said that he found himself displaced from office by an unconstitutional process having functioned continuously in his appointment for over two years.
	?I have not retired, resigned or vacated my office of Chief Justice, but, due to exertions by external forces reinforced by an extra judicial chain of events; find myself displaced from office by an unconstitutional process having functioned continuously in my appointment for over two years. There are times when might overtakes right and the helpless have to succumb to injustice,? Mr. Peiris stated.
	He stated that he could only have been removed from office in terms of the specific provisions contained in Article 107 (2) of the Constitution after an address of Parliament.
	Mr. Peiris stated the Parliament deliberated on the report of the Parliamentary Select Committee that had found Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake guilty of some of the charges.
	He said that report had been duly tabled in Parliament on December 08, 2012 and all the members were furnished with copies of the same. Further the procedure as set out in the Constitution and the Standing Orders was duly followed.
	He stated that former Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake was removed by an order of the then President and he was appointed by a warrant to the post of Chief Justice on January 15, 2013 with the concurrence of the Parliamentary Council which comprises of Government and Opposition Members.
	?It appears that the Executive has now sought to arrogate to itself a non-existent power by usurping the power of the legislature and thus engage itself in an unconstitutional process in an endeavour to remove me as the Chief Justice.
	?This is unlawful and violates the principle of the separation of powers, which is a fundamental feature of our Constitution and renders the exercise futile. As such all consequential acts will be tainted with illegality,? he stated.
	However, the letter sent by Presidential Secretary P.B. Abeykoon to Mr. Peiris stated that a resolution within the definition of Article 107 was not passed by Parliament on January 11 and therefore the appointment dated January, 15 2013 of President?s Counsel Peiris to the office of Chief Justice was null and void.(Lakmal Sooriyagoda)

Oppn. protests Tissa?s arrests
	
The main opposition Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) today protested over the arrest of MP Tissa Attanayake without notifying Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa.
Opposition Leader Nimal Siripala de Silva said the Speaker should be informed of the arrest of MPs in terms of the Parliamentary Privileges Act. Mr. Attanayake was arrested on the charge of document forgery during the election time.
Mr. Attanayake, who was the then UNP General Secretary, switched allegiance to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in the run-up to the January 8 election.
During the election campaign he produced a document claiming to be that of a pact between UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe and the then Common Opposition Candidate Maithripala Sirisena.
Mr. Sirisena and Mr. Wickremesinghe denied the existence of any such a pact and said their signatures had been forged by Mr. Attanayake.
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne, who responded said he too was arrested in 1994, but the then Speaker K.B. Ratnayake ruled that there was no requirement to notify him when carrying out such arrests.
State Minister Palitha Range Bandara said an MP accused of criminal offences could be arrested without notifying the Speaker.
"Nowhere has such a requirement been laid down. If there is any, please let us know," he challenged the Opposition Leader.
Democratic Left Front leader Vasudeva Nanayakkara said late Speaker Stanley Tillakeratne ruled that the Speaker, as the custodian of Parliament, should be kept informed regarding the arrests of MPs.
"This ruling was given when I was arrested in 1971," he said.
Deputy Justice Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe sought a ruling from Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa citing that there was lack of clarity on this matter.
"Instead of going by past rulings, it is better to seek a fresh ruling from the Speaker. Otherwise, we are confused as to what we should do," he said.
The Speaker agreed to give his opinion on this matter after studying the past rulings. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)

	The election of Maithripala Sirisena as the Sri Lankan President has offered a hope to the Tamils in Sri Lanka and they are able to move freely without the Army?s interruption, said K. Velayutham, Sri Lankan Minister of State for Plantation and Industry.
	Talking to reporters after meeting DMK leader M. Karunanidhi on Sunday, he said he had explained the situation after change in leadership and efforts were on to withdraw the Army from the Tamil areas and camps.
	Mr. Velaytham said one of the priorities of the new government was to rehabilitate the internally displaced people and those who were in the camps.
	Asked about the plans to send Tamil refugees to Sri Lanka, he said the Sri Lankan government was ready to provide all support to those who were willing to return.
	?At the same time we do not want to force anyone to come to Sri Lanka,? he said.
	To a question on the international inquiry against former President Mahinda Rajapaksa for his alleged war crimes, he said an inquiry was already being done in Geneva. ?Since Sri Lanka is a sovereign nation, we are for an internal inquiry,? he said. (The Hindu)

	President Maitripala Sirisena, in a televised address to the nation, said he that would not make use of helicopters except to attend to urgent duties.
	Appearing on a talk show televised by state run television channels, he said the term ?His Excellency??? should not be used when referring to him as President, and the term ?First Lady? when reference was made to his wife.
	He also confirmed that he had ordered the authorities not to use school children for events attended by him, as he had seen how they suffered during such functions in the past.
	?I will not stay in presidential palaces in Colombo, Kandy, Anuradhapura, Embilipitiya, Kataragama and Mahiyangane. I will use them for state functions only,? he said. He added that it was not befitting for him to stay in such mansions as a person hailing from a poor family.
	The President said the initial allocation of Rs. 10 billion for the Presidential Secretariat was cut down to Rs.2.7 billion by him, as a cost cutting exercise.
	He also revealed that an order had placed to purchase an aircraft priced US $ 16 million for the use of the former president. ?We cancelled this order, and instead, decided to channel these monies to procure spare parts for SriLankan,? he said.??

Qantas flight protest delays transfer of SL refugee
	
A Sri Lankan asylum seeker has been taken off a commercial flight from Melbourne to Darwin and his forced relocation postponed because of an onboard protest by other passengers, The Guardian said.
It was the second time in two months the planned forced movement of an asylum seeker has been abandoned because of demonstrations on board a plane.
On Monday, immigration staff was taking a 25-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker on a Qantas flight from Melbourne to Darwin, ahead of his expected deportation.
The man had been previously been living in the community but was recently re-detained.
He has told immigration officials he fears being tortured upon being returned to Sri Lanka.
UK?s high court, international media, and human rights organisations have consistently raised concerns over Sri Lankan asylum seekers being tortured upon return to Sri Lanka.
The asylum seeker was found by Australian authorities not to raise protection obligations.
On Monday, the Tamil man was seated on the plane, flanked by security officers, when one protester, who held a ticket for the flight, stood up and began telling other passengers about the man?s situation and his fears of being returned.
?After it was explained to the passengers what was happening and that [the asylum seeker] was on the flight, two passengers stood up and refused cabin staff instructions to buckle up. They were escorted off the plane by the staff,? demonstrator Jasmine Pilbrow said.
?Police officers then came and spoke to me. I left the plane after they decided to take [the asylum seeker] off the plane. I walked off behind him.?
The asylum seeker has been taken back to detention in Melbourne, where he says he is ?fine?.
A Department of Immigration spokeswoman said the flight was a ?routine transfer ? not a deportation? that was interrupted by protesters. The flight was delayed about 50 minutes.
?Due to the action of these protesters, the transfer did not proceed and some passengers were inconvenienced as a result. This was an unfortunate incident and the department will continue with plans to transfer this detainee.?
It is the second time in two months a planned forced movement of an asylum seeker has been thwarted by protest.
In December, the deportation of a Chinese national was abandoned when other passengers on the plane stood up in protest at his forced removal, and the pilot refused to leave Sydney airport until the man was removed.
The man remains in detention at Villawood in Sydney and legal avenues are being pursued to appeal his deportation.

SLFP push for new electoral system
	
	Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), as the main opposition, stressed the need for the change of current electoral system to the mix of the First- Past -the Post System and the Proportional Representation System during the 100-day programme of the new government, party officials said yesterday.
	Senior SLFP MP John Seneviratne told the Daily Mirror yesterday both the government and the opposition gave an undertaking to enact fresh legislation to provide for such electoral reforms and it would be proper for both sides to honour the pledge.
	Mr. Seneviratne said SLFP was ready to cooperate with the new government in the exercise. ?
	?We propose the First-Past the Post System to ensure representation for each electorate. Likewise, a certain quota of MPs should be elected under the Proportional Representation System. That is to ensure representation for minor and minority parties,? he said.
	Mr. Seneviratne who is also the Chief Opposition Whip said his party would not mind the extension of the dissolution of Parliament after the 100-day programme for a few more months to find time for the delimitation of electorates under the proposed system.
	Earlier, Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) leader Dinesh Gunawardane also pressed for electoral reforms to be implemented under the new regime.
	Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said at that moment that the government would appoint an all-party committee? to work in this regard.(Kelum Bandara)

Video: Tissa remanded till Feb. 11
	
Former UNP General Secretary and former Health Minister Tissa Attanayake was today remanded til February 11, by the Colombo Fort Acting Magistrate Jayantha Dias Nanayakkara on charges of producing fraudulent documents.
The CID informed Court said an analytical report obtained from the Examiner of Questioned Documents (EQD) and the evidence recorded from several witnesses had revealed that the document displayed by Mr. Attanayake was forged.
The CID said the suspect had committed a punishable offence under Sections 454 and 459 of the Penal Code by forging a document and displaying it to the public as genuine.
It said the suspect had also committed an offence under Section 80-C of the Presidential Election Act for displaying a fake document prior to an election, for the purpose of affecting the result of that election, in relation to the personal character or conduct of any candidate.
Meanwhile, Counsel Vikum Basnayake with Deemani Beddewela and Buddhika Induragalle appearing for the suspect told Court that his client had found this document inside a file at the Health Ministry after he assumed duties as the newly appointed Health Minister on December 18.
Counsel said that since his client had been directly involved in the discussions which were held between the UNP and other political parties including the TNA and his client firmly believed that the agreement he found at the Ministry was genuine and as such he displayed it to the media.
Meanwhile, the CID told Court the investigation into the incident was continuing and that the witnesses could be interfered with if the suspect was released on bail. ?
Police Spokesman Ajith Rohana said Mr. Attanayake was arrested by the CID yesterday morning from his residence in Bauddhaloka Mawatha and taken to the CID office where a statement was recorded.
Mr. Attanayake publicly announced on December 22 last year that there was a secret agreement between the then Common Opposition Candidate Maithripala Sirisena and UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe.
He claimed that he found a secret document where Maithripala Sirisena and Ranil Wickremesinghe had agreed on 15 points related to a proposed coalition with their signatures and that this could have an adverse effect on the peop;e.
Mr. Wickremesinghe said the document was false and complained to the CID on December 24 and a special inquiry was initiated as a result.
The CID recorded statements from 11 people including Mr. Sirisena, Mr. Wickremesinghe and Mr. Attanayake and sent the investigation reports to the Attorney General.
The AG has directed the detectives to take legal action against Mr. Attanayake as he had allegedly violated Section 459 of the Penal Code by using fraudulent documents to discredit the presidential candidate.

16,000 SL refugee kids born in India stateless
	
About 16,000 children born to Sri Lankan refugees in India are stateless since they do not have Sri Lankan citizenship and enjoy a mere refugee status.
The situation is being raised by activists at a time when Indian and Sri Lankan governments are seriously discussing repatriation of refugees from India, the Times of India said.
?Children born in Indian camps should be registered with the Sri Lankan deputy high commission within one year of their birth with birth certificates and camp registration details. Around 24,000 children were born in various camps in the last three decades but only 8,000 have been registered,? Organisation for Eelam Refugees' Rehabilitation (OfeRR) founder S. C. Chandrahasan said.
He said it was essential to register the 16,000 children, some of them youths now, as otherwise their repatriation to Sri Lanka would not be legal. He added that the Indian government should take steps to ensure that they are registered.
?When Chandrika Kumaratunga was Sri Lanka's President, the deputy high commission in Chennai had a better registration process. Then, officials in the deputy high commission reached out to the people. The Indian government should raise the issue with Sri Lanka to revive the policy adopted during Chandrika's tenure," Chandrahasan said.
The OfeRR had organized a mass registration camp in Salem in May 2012 but it was stopped by a few pro-eelam fringe groups. Another camp planned in Erode was also not held. Currently, only five registrations happen every day. Officials have been rejecting registration on flimsy grounds, including spelling errors in the certificates.
For this, Chandrahasan said the Sri Lankan government should come up with an inclusive registration policy before taking up repatriation. He suggested that the SL government should accept affidavits filed by the parents of the children.
