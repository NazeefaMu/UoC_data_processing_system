All Blacks Sonny Williams gets replacement medal
	
After wowing the world of sport with his incredible gesture to a young fan, New Zealand's Sonny Bill Williams has been rewarded by World Rugby with a new medal.
The All Blacks centre gave his Rugby World Cup winners medal to child who had burst onto the field after Saturday's win, sparking praise for the heart-warming moment of generosity.
And the game's governing body, not wanting the superstar to go without a memento for his achievements on the pitch because of his good-natured actions, have 'dug out a spare' to send home with him.
'World Rugby would like every winner this evening to go home with a medal, so they've rummaged in the store cupboard and they have found the final one,' said the event's host Alex Payne, before Williams was given a standing ovasion.
But the centre has played down the exceptional nature of the incident, saying it could have been any one of his team-mates. 'I'm really surprised, most of the boys would have done the same,' he said.
Williams was unaware he would be presented with a replacement medal but World Cup organisers acted following a request from the New Zealand players and management.
When on stage Williams also asked if team-mate Jerome Kaino would be given a new All Blacks beanie hat, with the flanker having given his to teenager Lines on Saturday night.
The sensational moment occurred when Charlie Lines, 15, burst on to the Twickenham pitch after the final whistle confirmed a 34-17 final victory over Australia in search of an autograph, but Williams made sure he left the ground with much more.
The 30-year-old centre, who was lauded for consoling deflated South Africa players after the semis, explained that he wanted to do something special for Lines.(Daily Mail)

The government is to decide on its future course of action in respect of the incident after studying the two reports, sources said.
The prime minister had told the government MPs that firm action would be taken against those responsible for the attack, irrespective of their rank, if they were found to have used excessive force against the demonstrating students.

DFCC to finance first private grid-connected solar power project
	
		 		 
		 
			
Recording another first, DFCC Bank PLC, renowned for being the pioneer in renewable energy financing,?will soon add solar energy to its renewable energy portfolio.?
The Bank recently approved a project loan to Saga Solar (Pvt) Ltd; a ground breaking initiative undertaken by a team of investors and backed with the expertise of professionals in the Solar Energy sector.?
Analyzed and structured by DFCC?s own multifaceted team, this transaction speaks volumes of the Bank?s commitment to develop the renewable energy sector as well play a pivotal role in the economic development of the country.
Solar energy has been regarded as the green energy category with the highest potential and is expected to form the future of Sri Lanka?s green energy drive. There have been solar applications in the country before on a small scale such as domestic solar PV systems, solar powered drip irrigation, street lamps and electric fences. However, this project will be the first large scale commercial solar project with grid connectivity. The project will add 10 Mw of generating capacity and is located at a 45 acre site in Hambantota.
DFCC Bank has structured the financial solution sought by the borrower and is assisting the project promoter from concept to finish. The Bank is confident that this project will set the stage for other solar energy developers, lending agencies and equity investors to increase their focus on the Solar Energy sector.
Founded in 1955, DFCC Bank is one of the oldest development banks in Asia, and recently celebrated its Diamond Jubilee. The Bank possesses a proud heritage of achievements, which includes financing new economic sectors in the country and being the wind beneath the wings of many trail-blazing entrepreneurs especially in their early and risky start-up stages. Today these sectors have become mainstream businesses that support the national economy in many ways.
The Bank?s foray into the renewable energy sector is significant. In 1994, the Bank financed Sri Lanka?s first ever privately owned, grid connected mini-hydro power plant, with both long term debt and equity. The Bank also financed a pioneering manufacturer of turbines for local and foreign hydro power plants. This project was the recipient of ADFIAP?s award for ?Outstanding Project ? Technology Development?. Assistance has also been extended to local hydropower developers to set up projects overseas.
?DFCC Bank was also the pioneer financier for private sector wind power projects in the country, when it part-financed the first wind power project in 2010. The Bank?s involvement extended beyond mere financing - to facilitating the introduction of a cost-based, technology specific tariff structure. This enabled projects using wind technology to be commercially viable and has spurred development of this form of renewable energy in Sri Lanka. The success of these pioneering projects has catalysed the setting up of several other ventures resulting in thriving industries. Today, hydro and wind power combined supplies nearly 10 percent of the country?s power needs.?
DFCC Bank has now merged with its commercial banking subsidiary; DFCC Vardhana Bank, and has transformed into a full-service bank. The combined entity offers a breadth of seamless banking solutions which brings together the expertise of a pioneer development bank and the energy of a dynamic commercial bank. Its services are delivered through a network of 137 branches and service points located island-wide.

Fitch affirms HNB Assurance and HNB General Insurance ratings
	
		 		 
		 
			
Fitch Ratings Lanka has affirmed HNB Assurance PLC?s (HNBA) National Insurer Financial Strength Rating and National Long-Term rating at ?A(lka)?.?
Fitch has also affirmed its subsidiary HNB General Insurance Ltd?s (HNB GI) National Insurer Financial Strength Rating and National Long-Term rating at ?A(lka)?. The Outlook on the ratings is Stable.
The ratings reflect the Sri Lanka-based insurance group?s satisfactory capitalisation in terms of regulatory solvency ratio, its prudent policy towards investment and modest market share.?
The ratings also reflect synergies that HNBA enjoys from using parent Hatton National Bank PLC?s (HNB, AA-(lka)/Stable) wider branch network, HNBA?s importance to the bank in providing bancassurance products and?
HNB?s 60 percent stake in the insurance group.
HNBA was established in 2001 and operated as a composite insurer until end-2014. On 1 January 2015, the company transferred its non-life business to its fully owned subsidiary, HNB GI, while retaining the life business.?
This was done to comply with a regulatory requirement for insurers to split their life and non-life businesses by 7 February 2015. The ratings of HNB GI take into account its status as a core operating entity of HNBA.
Fitch views the consolidated capital strength of HNBA as satisfactory. At 1H15, the life regulatory solvency ratio was 2.85x (2014: 2.29x, 2013: 2.04x). The non-life solvency ratio fell sharply to 1.61x in 1H15 (2014: 3.07x 2013: 3.89x) due to lower profitability resulting from intense competition. However, the solvency ratios for both life and non-life are comfortably above the regulatory minimum of 1.0x.
HNBA expects to strengthen HNB GI?s capitalisation via a capital infusion, which will shore up solvency until the subsidiary returns to profitability.?
From 2016, insurers will?
be required to report risk-based capital (RBC) positions. HNBA expects the life and non-life business segments to maintain RBC ratios of at least 170 percent. This compares with an expected regulatory minimum of?120 percent.

Higher Education Ministry disputes police claim
	
In the aftermath of the police attack on students of the Higher National Diploma in Accounting (HNDA), the Higher Education and Highways Ministry yesterday disputed police claims that no official was present at the time to meet any of the protesters.
Ministry Additional Secretary C. Jayasinghe told Daily Mirror he was present at the Ministry discussing with the relevant authorities on addressing the concerns of students attending this study course at Sri Lanka Institute of Advanced Technology.
He said the minister had even requested a meeting with the directors of the various branches of the institute.
?On the day of this incident, there was a request for a meeting with students. We agreed to allow five students to come and handover their petition. We sent the message to the students near the gate. But, in the meantime, the clash had started. Students may have acted provocatively,? Mr. Jayasinghe said.
However, he said a Cabinet memorandum would be submitted requesting that the HNDA be granted degree status.

HSBC beats profit expectations on drop in fines
	
		 		 
		 
			
REUTERS: ?HSBC reported a better than expected 32 percent rise in pre-tax profit for the third quarter, with a drop in fines for past misconduct countering the impact of a slowdown in Asia and a jump in spending on regulatory compliance.
Costs related to fines and compensation for customers fell by US $ 1.4 billion from the third quarter of last year, marking its progress on conduct issues that have marred recent quarterly earnings reports.
Yet the London-based lender continues to grapple with declining revenue and also reported that it spent US $ 2.2 billion on regulation and compliance in the first nine months of the year, up 33 percent year-on-year, even as the British government looks to take a more accommodative stance towards the industry.
Underlying revenue fell 4 percent to US $ 15.1 billion compared with the same quarter last year, as plunging stock markets and slowing economic growth hit its business in Asia.
?HSBC management have done a very good job of trying to correct its internal problems, but these results show no bank can improve revenues if the global economy is against it,? said Jim Antos, analyst at Mizuho Securities Asia in Hong Kong.
The bank reported a profit of US $ 6.1 billion for the three months to the end of September 30, up from US $ 4.6 billion. That was more than the consensus estimate of US $ 5.2 billion, based on the average of analysts? forecasts compiled by the bank.
Adjusted profit for the quarter fell 14 percent from a year ago to US $ 5.5 billion, taking into account the lower fines and a gain from the sale of its stake in Industrial Bank.
HSBC?s London shares were down 0.6 percent at 504 pence by 0810 GMT, broadly in line with a weaker European bank index.
The shares are down 17 percent this year -- hurt by concerns about slowing Asian growth -- compared with a 2 percent rise for the European banking sector.
Goals progress
HSBC said there had been ?no visible impact? on credit quality in Asia, with losses from bad loans coming in lower than analysts had expected.
The earnings update gave investors a first chance to check on progress on the 10 goals HSBC management had set in June, including a 25 percent reduction to risk-weighted assets, the sale of operations in Turkey and Brazil and US $ 4.5 billion to US $ 5 billion in cost cuts.
HSBC said it was nearly 30 percent of the way towards completing the reduction in its assets and achieved US $ 400 million of cost savings in the quarter.
That helped the bank improve its common equity capital ratio to 11.8 percent at the end of September, from 11.6 percent three months earlier.
Perhaps the most-watched of the 10 goals by investors is the bank?s strategic review into whether it should move its headquarters out of Britain, with Hong Kong viewed as the most likely destination.
HSBC said it had made progress on this but the decision could slip beyond its original year-end deadline, echoing comments made by Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver in October.?

The Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation yesterday said that SriLankan Airlines enjoyed fuel savings and payload gains by diverting its flight UL 230 to Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA) instead of diverting it to Trivandrum, Chennai or Male due to heavy foggy conditions around the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA).
UL 230 from Kuwait to BIA with 253 passengers and 14 crew members on board was diverted to the MRIA last morning.
The Transport Ministry said the passengers had also been thankful to the MRIA since they had the convenience of landing within the territory of Sri Lanka instead of landing in India or the Maldives.
?Previously, southern Indian airports and Male were the options for emergency landing ? now the alternative has become the MRIA. This is the second incident where flights on their way to BIA were diverted to the MRIA due to bad weather conditions. Though the MRIA was criticized by some parties, these incidents are good examples that showed the benefits of the MRIA,? the ministry official said. (Piyumi Fonseka)
