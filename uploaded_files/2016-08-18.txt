Infra-red cameras on trains to save wild elephants
	
The Wildlife Conservation Department has decided to install Infra-Red cameras in trains travelling through forest areas known to be frequented by wild elephants. This new move is an attempt to save the wild elephants from being run over by trains.
Wildlife Conservation Department Director W.K.S. Pathirana said he decided to take this step in view of the increasing death toll of wild elephants run over by train in the Northern and Eastern railway lines.
Talking to BBC about his plan to save wild elephants from train accidents, he said experienced Wildlife Conservation officers would also accompany train drivers. Mr. Pathirana said for a start, they were deployed in Polonnaruwa and Welikanda areas to accompany the drivers.
However, he said the project might be held up for want of funds to procure infra-red cameras. (Romesh Madusanka)

July vehicle registrations dive to lowest in 2016
	
Sri Lanka?s vehicle registrations in almost all categories except buses and heavy trucks have taken a dive in July, recording the lowest monthly figure for the year, a monthly vehicle registration tracker by a leading Colombo-based stock brokerage showed.
The total number of vehicles registered during July was down to 35,629 from 44,589 in June, yet the number still remains high due to the poor state of the country?s public transport system.
According to JB Securities (Pvt.) Limited, the motor car registrations have come down to 2,489 units in July from 3,026 units in June and significantly lowered from 9,736 units recorded in the same month last year. Last year?s vehicle registrations reached an all-time high as the policymakers who sought re-election gave fiscal and monetary stimulus to the public to spend lavishly in a myopic move, destroying the currency and plunging the economy into a balance of payment crisis.
The country then had to be bailed out by the International Monetary Fund, which gave its first tranche in June of its US $ 1.5 billion three-year extended
fund facility.
In 2015, the aspirational middle-income earning class imported whopping 658,241 vehicles, out of which 94,727 units composed of motorcars, partly due to the Rs.10,000 salary increment offered to the 1.4 million public sector employees.
During the first seven months of this year, 267,025 vehicles were imported, of which 21,890 were motorcars.
During July, there were 1,331 brand-new cars registered, of which half or 663 were Maruti Altos.
?Maruti that had a total dominant market in the less than 1,000 cc segment is seeing high competition from the relatively new arrivals backed by major brands - Hyundai Eon and Renault Kwid,? said JB Securities Managing Director Murtaza Jafferjee.
Pre-owned cars had 1,158 units, led by Toyota Axio and Aqua, followed by Suzuki Wagon R and Honda Grace and Fit.
Premium brands were up from 64 units to 87 units in a month. There were 36 Mercedes, 15 BMWs and 14 units of Audi.
Electric car registrations, down from 71 units to 64 units, mainly consisted of 59 units of Nissan Leaf. ?
Sports utility vehicles (SUVs) were down to 414 units from 631 units in June.
Three-wheel registrations at last were down to 3,678 units from 6,995 units seen a month ago and 12,248 units a year ago.
Bajaj claimed a share of 87.1 percent, followed by TVS with 9.2 percent and Piaggio with 3.6 percent.
In 2015, 128,911 three-wheelers were registered while during the first seven months this year another 31,010 units were registered.
The three-wheel industry has been cited as one of the reasons for the country?s dearth of labour as less educated youth tend to get into easy three-wheel driving job to make a living by ripping off the commuter and develop no skill thereafter to become job ready.
Once they, in hundreds of thousand, move out of the labour force due to aging or a slowdown in the industry with the planned facelift in public transport, the country will face serious socioeconomic issues with no social security net in place.
The registration of two-wheelers was slightly down to 24,994 from 29,264 in June. ?Bajaj has reclaimed market leadership recording a market share of 30.7 percent sans scooters closely followed by Honda with 29 percent, Hero recorded 15.2 percent steadily dropping share closely followed by TVS with 14.1 percent,? Jafferjee observed in his note.
There were 179 buses registered against 176 in June and 184 heavy trucks registered against 126 in June.
In the absence of an immediate remedy to curb vehicle imports for consumption purposes, Lankan roads are likely to become almost impassable, creating a loss of financial resources and manpower, which otherwise could be used for productive work.

Maithri should take responsibility for splitting SLFP: MR
	
Former President and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa today charged the yesterday?s removal of 16 SLFP electoral organizers had effectively caused a split in the SLFP and that President Maithripala Sirisena should take the responsibility for splitting the party.
Issuing a statement, he said the decision by the President to replace popular organisers of the SLFP with less popular politicians is the latest round of reprisals against SLFP members associated with the Joint Opposition.
?
?On earlier occasions, Dilum Amunugama, Salinda Dissanayake, S.M. Chandrasena, Geetha Kumarasinghe and Prasanna Ranatunga were similarly removed from their organiserships. Puttlam district parliamentarian Sanath Nishantha was suspended from the party. This persecution has effectively caused a split in the SLFP,? he said.
Sixteen electoral organizers including Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, Pavithra Wanniarachchi,
Rohitha Abeygunawardena, C.B. Ratnayake, Gamini Lokuge, Kheliya Rambukwella and several others were removed from their organiserships by the President on Wednesday.
Mr. Rajapaksa said the move would weaken the SLFP and act in favour of the UNP as organizers such as
Prasanna Ranatunga, who got the highest preferential votes in the Gampaha district, had also been removed.
?These are all very popular politicians and stalwarts of the SLFP. Nationally known figures have been replaced with individuals who are either defeated candidates. Such changes are designed to weaken the SLFP and to give the UNP the upper hand when it comes to an election. The responsibility for splitting the SLFP by removing its most popular electoral organisers will finally have to be borne by the President who is the leader of the party,? he said.
He charged the removal of organisers was the second phase in a plan to destroy the SLFP and the first was the dissolving of the local government institutions.
?These local government institutions would have been immensely helpful to the party in the event of any election. Yet all these were dissolved, giving a clear advantage to the UNP. The coalition between the UNP and the SLFP was extended from two years to five years without seeking the views of the SLFP central committee. I call upon all members of the SLFP to carefully observe these moves that are being made to weaken the party and give the UNP the upper hand,? he said.

Plantation Industries Minister Naveen Dissanayake today threatened to resign from his ministerial portfolio if the Finance Ministry tried to take a sum of US 60 million dollars belonging to the Sri Lanka Tea Board, which falls under his Ministry.
Addressing a ceremony in Elpitiya, Mr. Dissanayake said it was reported that the Finance Ministry intended to take the funds from the Tea Board. ?I can?t give Tea Board funds. If they were to take it, I will resign as I can?t continue to function as the Minister,? he said.
He said the funds were collected through the CESS Tax and it therefore belonged to the Tea Board. ?The funds do not belong to the government. It will be used for the promotion campaign of the Tea Board which will protect the Ceylon brand in tea? he said.
Minister Dissanayake asked State Minister of Finance Lakshman Yapa who was also at the event to enlighten the President over his remarks stating that it would be an injustice if the funds were taken away from the Board.
?No one had ever tried to take away funds of the tea board before. I?m not certain as to why they are trying to take funds now. These moves are not in line with yahapalana principles. If the Government is going against the principles of Yahapalanaya, we can?t endorse it. We are working without making a fuss but if there is injustice I will quit this post?. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Political bigwigs trip STF Commandant
	
Two weeks after the decision by the National Police Commission to appoint SDIG M.R Latheef as the Commandant of the Special Task Force (STF), moves are afoot at a very high level to override the recommendation the Daily Mirror learns.
Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police M.R. Latheef was appointed as the head of the STF upon recommendation by the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Pujith Jayasundera on August 4.
Latheef, who was a member of the 1st batch of STF officers since its creation in 1984, had reportedly come under severe pressure from various quarters to voluntarily step down, sources told the Daily Mirror.
The Daily Mirror learns that the son of a very high ranking politician is behind the move to stall the appointment.
?He had in-fact been called by someone who is an arms dealer, who shares the same surname as a former President and, and was asked not to take up the appointment. That is the sort of pressure that is being exerted on him,? the source said.
Latheef?s appointment was to come into effect on August 9.
?The appointment was made following the recommendation by the IGP but his hands also seem to be tied as the political forces at work are ranked very high. His racial background also seems to be playing more than a small part in this issue,? sources at the Presidential Secretariat told the Daily Mirror.
The Police Commission has on August 4, released a statement to the Press announcing the appointment of Latheef, after which moves were afoot to prevent the appointment.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror the Secretary and the Spokesperson for the National Police Commission said the Constitutional power of appointment rests with the Commission.
?We have appointed Mr. Latheef but he has yet not been released for duty. We will discuss this issue at the meeting tomorrow. Constitutionally the Police Commission is the only body, which has the power to make these appointments and we have made the appointment,? he said.
When asked as to the reason for the delay on the appointment Mr. Cooray refused to speculate.
?We cannot pin point a single reason nor should we speculate. All we are aware as to now that the appointment has not been executed despite our appointment and this will be taken up for discussion today,? he said.
According to sources within the Special Task Force, the Daily Mirror learns that many vehicles and personnel used by politicians for private purposes have been returned to their stations and garages following the news of the appointment.
?The STF garages have seen an increase in the return of vehicles since the news spread about the appointment. Officers who were stationed to look after coconut and rubber estates of politicians have also returned to their normal posts,? STF sources told the Daily Mirror.
SDIG Latheef following his operational duties in the Special Task Force was attached to the National Intelligence Bureau as counter-terrorism specialist during which time he was trained by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the British MI5 and the Special Air Services (SAS).
He was also attached as a counter-terrorism specialist as First Officer in various stations including Paris, London, Bangkok and Geneva during the height of the operations of the LTTE.
Reports said that he was the only security specialist from Sri Lanka to advice security for major events including the Beijing Olympics in 2008. (Hafeel Farisz)

Sacked due to poor performance: Duminda
	
The removal of 40 district and electoral organizers of the SLFP was not an act of vengeance, revenge or tit for tat but entirely resulting in their poor performance in their respective districts, constituencies and loyalty to the party, SLFP General Secretary and Minister Duminda Dissanayaka said today.
He told the weekly news briefing at the party office that the SLFP Central Committee was of the view that the revamping of the party structure at grass roots level was extremely vital in view of the forthcoming local government polls. Hence those who have not stood with the party in the last one and half years, went against party guidelines and instructions and were highly indisciplined had to be replaced.
?You do not need much reasons to justify the expulsion of party organizers who have violated the party constitution. When a party organizer betrays the party, he automatically loses all his positions in the party. It is as simple as that,? Minister Dissanayaka stressed.
He said party leader, President Maithripala Sirisena remained for more than one and half years watching their behaviour closely even by getting flak from party loyalists for not taking action against those who double crossed the party and added however, they would not lose their party membership.
Minister Dissanayaka asked journalists whether not only Mahinda Rajapaksa but even if Chandrika Kumaratunga would have had the patience level as much as that of President Sirisena to take action against the black sheep of them party.
Commenting on the 65th SLFP convention scheduled to be held at ?Maligapitiya? in Kurunegala on September 4, Minister Dissanayaka said all SLFP members, former local government members. Provincial Council members will be invited for the biggest ever party convention and added former Presidents Rajapaksa and Kumaratunga had already been invited by a senior member of the party and Rajapaksa had accepted the invitation to attend.
?To promote party unity and mutual harmony, we have decided to provide seating facilities to the two former presidents on either sides of President Sirisena?s seat on the stage, Minister Dissanayaka said.
He said the main and immediate target of the SLFP was to win the local government polls and therefore the reorganization of the party, appointing young professionals, women, TU leaders, journalists and any one who has better qualifications as party organizers was vital and that is what the Central Committee was doing and added President Sirisena had already spoken to all district and electoral organizers.
Each and every district will be under two District leaders comprising a cabinet Minister from the district itself and another minister chosen from another district, he said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

SLIC delivers strong performance for 2015
	
By Chandeepa Wettasinghe
The country?s largest insurance provider, the state-owned Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (SLIC), will be looking to consolidate on its core strengths over the coming two years, after delivering a strong performance for 2015, the SLIC Chairman said.
?At the moment for the next 2 years, yes,? Hemaka Amarasuriya said in response to a question by MirrorBusiness whether the insurance giant will focus on consolidating its recent expansions, on the sidelines of an event to celebrate SLIC?s recent triumphs. He said that the involvement of veteran private sector individuals at the top level has helped increase efficiencies and profitability, and SLIC will focus on digitalizing its back-end operations through SAP (Systems, Applications and Product) and other technologies.
?I hope that more in the private sector leave their riches and come to improve the public sector,? he added.
However, he added that SLIC will still attempt to ride on the growth momentum it had built up over 2015.
The year saw SLIC?s gross written premium increasing to Rs.24.5 billion from Rs.20.6 billion year-on-year (yoy) with the life insurance fund increasing to Rs.77 billion from Rs.74 billion yoy and the general insurance fund increasing to Rs.15 billion from Rs.13 billion yoy.?
The country?s life insurance penetration increased to 12 percent according to SLIC, compared to 11.3 percent yoy according to Central Bank data, while SLIC?s market share in life insurance stood at 23 percent, and general insurance stood at 21 percent.
?This leap may have been due to cash hand-outs given by the government to the state-sector employees, and the additional disposable income created due to deflationary pressures from subsidies in the 2015 budget.
?However, Amarasuriya is still disappointed over the country?s current insurance landscape. ??We have to educate people on the importance of insurance. 12 percent is very low. What I think is that as the economy develops, there will be more money, and there will be a realization of the importance of insurance,? Amarasuriya said.
?The country?s gross domestic product grew just 4.8 percent in 2015, compared to 4.9 percent in 2014, while projections for 2016 are now 5 percent, down from initial projections of 5.8-6 percent earlier this year. Meanwhile, Amarasuriya noted that SLIC will continue to channel its profits into the safety of government securities, and will be circumspect in overall asset management. ??We won?t invest in shares a lot at the moment because we?re loaded with assets. We don?t want to be lopsided in asset management. We have Grand Hyatt, Litro Gas, Litro Terminals and 55 percent of Lanka Hospitals. We have to be careful,? he said.
SLIC is one of the main investment vehicles of the government, investing heavily in private banks in concert with the state-controlled pension funds and state banks in order to have the largest shareholding in them, since private parties are legally allowed to have only up to 15 percent ownerships in banks. While Amarasuriya noted that investments in banking shares will remain profitable due to the multiple interest rate hikes seen this year, he expressed some worry over the prospects of other corporate investments. ?Many Sri Lankan corporates have overextended themselves by borrowing heavily to invest in capital projects, and are now in precarious positions due to the rise in interest rates.
?Amarasuriya said that SLIC will sell stocks if there will be a massive profit realization, but will be cautious of buying. ??Shares, if we have an opportunity to make profits we will trade. If their profile is okay and if the stokebrokers recommend, we will buy. We mainly go for blue chips and banks. The banks have been safe through good risk management,? he added.

Some Northern politicians making false allegations -Ruwan
	
Some politicians in the North are making false allegations, stating that former LTTE cadres at rehabilitation centres are being injected with poison, which had resulted in them developing various ailments such as Cancer, State Minister of Defense Ruwan Wijewardene said yesterday.
Mr. Wijewardene, speaking to journalists at the Sri Sambodhi Viharaya in Delgoda, said that these false allegations are being made at a time when the government is making an enormous effort to resolve the issues faced by the people in the North and bring about reconciliation.
?It is sad to hear some politicians in the North making false allegations when the government is making a genuine effort to resolve the issue of the Northern people. Anyone, including those from the international community, can visit the rehabilitation camps after obtaining permission from the government and see for themselves the work that is being done,? he said.
He said diseases such as cancer can effect anyone at any time. (Yohan Perera)

The Speaker also said he would take legal advice on the matter if it was necessary when joint opposition members including its leader MP Dinesh Gunawardane, Prof. G.L. Peiris, MP Bandula Gunawardane and MP Udaya Gammanpila handed over a six-page petition to the Speaker regarding this matter.
Addressing a media briefing, joint opposition member MP Udaya Gammanpila said it would be against the Constitution and the Standing Orders if the Speaker endorsed the OMP Bill and it would be an offence as he had intentionally violated the legal procedure.
He said even a no-confidence motion could be brought against the Speaker if he endorsed the OMP Bill.
?According to Section 78 (2) of the Constitution requires that the passing of a Bill should be done in accordance with the Standing Orders and Section 79 of the Constitution includes that the Speaker should certify a Bill which has been duly passed in Parliament. Section 151 of the Constitution says the Cabinet approval should be sought if any Bill which is related to collecting taxes and deposits the collect revenue to the Consolidated Fund, when presenting in Parliament,? he said.
He said if the Speaker would endorse the OMP Bill it would be totally against Sections 78, 79 and 151 of the Constitution. He said it was also against the Section 133 of the Standing Orders as it said that the Speaker should declare that he has obtained the Cabinet approval to the Bill at Parliament.
