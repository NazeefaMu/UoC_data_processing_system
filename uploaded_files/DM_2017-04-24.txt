Australia, New Zealand hit back at North Korea threat
	

SYDNEY AFP April23, 2017-
Australia and New Zealand stiffened their rhetoric against North Korea Sunday after the isolated state threatened Canberra with a nuclear strike, urging it to think twice before blindly and zealously toeing the US line. 
The move comes as US Vice President Mike Pence wraps up an Asia tour, which has included visits to South Korea, Japan and Australia partly to reassure allies amid fears that Pyongyang may be readying for a sixth nuclear test. 
If Australia persists in following the US moves to isolate and stifle North Korea... this will be a suicidal act, a North Korean foreign ministry spokesman said after Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop called the hermit state a serious threat. 
The spokesman, speaking to the Norths official KCNA news agency, warned Bishop to think twice about the consequences. 
Australias close ally New Zealand has since accused North Korea of having evil intent.  Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee told Television New Zealand Sunday people knew little about Kim Jong-Uns regime but you would assume that underneath him there is a very big machinery of people who have equally evil intent.

CPC trade unions call off strike
	
The indefinite strike launched by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) Trade Unions collective has been called off following a written assurance given by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe that no agreement will be signed regarding the China Bay Oil Tank Farm in Trincomalee during his Indian tour, the Trade Unions Collective said this evening.
The assurance was made during a discussion between Trade Union representatives and the Prime Minister, together with Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama, Petroleum Minister Chandima Weerakkody and several other government representatives at Temple Trees.
A countrywide protest held by the CPC unions collective yesterday leading to a fuel shortage across the country demanding to halt the government moves to sign the agreement on leasing the China Bay Oil Tank Farm to Lanka Indian Oil Corporation (LIOC).
Speaking to the Daily Mirror Union Spokesman Bandula Saman Kumara said the unions have stopped their trade union action following a written assurance given by the Premier that no agreement would be signed regarding the China Bay Oil Tank Farm during his Indian tour.
Earlier, the striking petroleum workers insisted on a written assurance from President Maithripala Sirisena that the Trincomalee oil farm would not be leased to the Lanka India Oil Company if they were to call off the strike.
Earlier in the evening, TU representatives held talks with Petroleum Minister Chandima Weerakkody. Later the President had responded to the union request, saying that he could not meet the union members at that time but would give a date to discuss the matter later and requested to call off the strike until then.
As the striking petroleum workers insisted that the trade union action would not be suspended, a meeting was arranged with the Prime Minister.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister's office sources said that the Premier had agreed to discuss the Trincomalee oil tank issue with Indian authorities only after talking to relevant trade unions. It has also been agreed that trade unions will get the opportunity of discussing the issue with the cabinet sub committee on the Hambantota Port development.
In addition Petroleum Resources Minister Chandima Weerakkody will submit a report on the development of the Trincomalee oil tank to the cabinet committee on financial committee.
The people were inconvenienced during the strike and long vehicle queues were seen at several filling stations.
Saman Kumara said during the strike period 650 to 700 of the 1,300 filling stations ran out of fuel. (Yohan Perera and Thilanka Kanakaratne)

France votes in closely contested Presidential election
	

Over a quarter of registered voters cast their ballots by midday Sunday in the first round of the French presidential election that is being watched eagerly across Europe and further afield.
The turnout of 28.5 per cent in mainland France was in line with the last election, in 2012, won by socialist President Francois Hollande, and slightly below the midday turnout of 31.2 per cent in 2007.
Final polls showed a race too close to call, with four leading candidates within a few percentage points of each other.
Far right leader Marine Le Pen and leftist Jean-Luc Melenchon have both vowed to reshape the European Union or pull France out of at least some of its structures.
The top two candidates in Sundays vote will go through to the decisive second round on May 7. Centrist Emmanuel Macron, a pro-European social and economic liberal who is favourite in the polls, was the first of the big four candidates to cast his ballot.
The 39-year-old former economy minister voted along with his wife Brigitte in the town hall of Le Touquet, a seaside resort northof Paris.
It was the same building where Macron and Brigitte, his former schoolteacher, wed ten years earlier.
Le Pen voted in the former mining town of Henin-Beaumont, a one-time socialist stronghold that like many places in post-industrial northern France has swung to the far right.
Conservative former prime minister Francois Fillon, whose campaign has been rocked by allegations that he gave his wife a fake taxpayer-funded job as his parliamentary aide, queued with other voters to cast his ballot in Paris well-heeled 7th arrondissement.

From monarch to monk: Scion of Sikkim dynasty  becomes a  recluse
	

Hindustan Times, Gangtok, 23.04.2017 - Once crowned monarch, he now lives the reclusive life of a monk. Wangchuk Namgyal has preferred to slip into monasteries, caves and resultant oblivion despite being the scion of the Chogyal dynasty that once ruled Sikkim before merging with the Indian Republic to become its 22nd province in 1975. 
But some four decades later, Namgyal still evokes awe in at least some of his former subjects and derision among those opposed to the erstwhile royalty. Monarchists still speculate about his whereabouts and well-being. Where is he and how is he are frequent themes of discussions behind closed doors of many homes in Gangtok, the states laid-back capital.

Furious Afghans call for resignations after Taliban base attack
	

MAZAR SHARIF AFP April23, 2017 
Afghanistan on Sunday observed a national day of mourning after at least 100 soldiers were killed or wounded in a Taliban attack on a military base, prompting angry calls for ministers and army chiefs to resign. 
The exact toll from Fridays assault in the northern province of Balkh remains unclear, with some local officials putting the number of dead as high as 130. 
Flags flew at half-mast throughout the country and special prayers were said for the dead. 
The defence ministry gave a figure of at least 100 soldiers killed or wounded. It ignored media calls for a complete breakdown of casualties following the five-hour attack near the provincial capital of Mazar-i-Sharif. 
But local officials including, Mohammad Ibrahim Khairandish the head of the provincial council, put the death toll as high as 130. 
Ordinary Afghans vented their anger at the government for its inability to counter a series of brazen Taliban assaults, including a raid on the countrys largest military hospital in Kabul in March that left dozens dead.

Gifting Montessori teachers to the world
	
Good Shepherd AMI Montessori Training Centre- Internationally recognisedpre-school teacher training institute
Dr Montessori being welcomed by the children of the Kotahena Montessori. Also in the picture are Mario and Renilde being presented with flowers by a little child - 1948

Following the footsteps of Dr. Maria Montessori, the genius who introduced world renowned pre-school method and the founder of the AMI method of educating children, Good Shepherd Maria Montessori Training Centre in Colombo, has produced hundreds of Montessori teachers who serve in Sri Lanka and the world around. 
For more than 70 years this hallowed institution has been silently shaping the minds of thousands of school leaving young women, some of whom are now teaching and guiding toddlers and world around. 

"Handed over to the Good Shepherd Sisters by Dr. Maria Montessori herself in 1944, the legacy continues with the mission to understand that the true spirit of teaching is in the imparting of knowledge, the building of a good character and with love and dedication to be faithful custodians of the Montessori Method


Founded and run by the Good Shepherd Sisters-a congregation of reverent nuns in the Roman Catholic Church-over the years the Montessori Training Centre has produced hundreds of highly qualified and internationally recognised preschool or Montessori teachers who are now serving in countries like Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Canada. Affiliated to the Association Montessori Internationale (AMI) in Amsterdam in the Netherlands, Good Shepherd Maria Montessori Training Centre is the only authorized AMI Montessori Training Centre in Sri Lanka. 
Handed over to the Good Shepherd Sisters by Dr. Maria Montessori herself in 1944, the legacy continues with the mission to understand that the true spirit of teaching is in the imparting of knowledge, the building of a good character and with love and dedication to be faithful custodians of the
Montessori Method. 
Situated at St. Bridgets Convent, 85, C.W.W. Kannangara Mawatha, Colombo 07, the centre has a commendable vision, To communicate an understanding of education as a help to life, nurtured by love, compassion, patience, care and commitment to the needs of little children the world over, practising the principles of Dr. Maria Montessoris method of Education. 
A milestone in Montessori education in Sri Lanka
In 1944 Dr. Maria Montessori who visited Sri Lanka to train teachers and introduce AMI method handed over her pedagogical legacy to Rev. Mother Immaculate Conception Hughes, Provincial Superior of the Good Shepherd Sisters, who became her extended family, under the umbrella of the AMI. Good Shepherd Convent, Kotahena started its first Childrens House with Sr. Ita Cleery as Directress in 1944 . 
Having completed conducting a Training Course in Koddaikanal, India, on the invitation of the Ceylon Teachers Association, in 1944 Dr. Maria Montessori along with her son Mario came over to conduct the first-ever Training Course in Sri Lanka.At the Training Course in Kodaikanal, India , a few Sri Lankans including the late Joyce Goonesekera and Lena Wickramaratne too, followed and successfully completed the course. At the course conducted at Good Shepherd Convent, Kotahena, Colombo 13, Joyce and Lena assisted Dr. Maria Montessori. 
The course was participated in by 300 principals of schools, teachers, lecturers and their wives from universities and training colleges, young students from schools, mothers interested in helping their children and many Good Shepherd Sisters, who later opened childrens houses in their convents in different parts of the island. 
At the conclusion of the course in 1944 ( July  September ) those who attended lectures having the required credits in the written and practical examinations were awarded certificates, which were endorsed after practice in a recognized institute. This was the beginning of training Montessori teachers who studied AMI method of educating children. 
In the same year Leena Wickramaratne started her House of Children in Colpetty and later in her home town, Kandy. Having given the initiation to this world renowned method Montessori teaching to Sri Lanka, Dr. Maria Montessori returned to the country in 1948 at the invitation of the Government of Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) for the Celebration of its Independence. 
In 1957 under the auspices of the AMI, A. M. Joosten, was appointed the personal representative of Mario Montessori and Director of the Good Shepherd Maria Montessori Training Centre, St. Bridgets Convent, Colombo 07.


"In the same year Leena Wickramaratne started her House of Children in Colpetty and later in her home town, Kandy. Having given the initiation to this world renowned method, Dr. Maria Montessori returned to the country in1948 at the invitation ofthe Government..."
Sr. Ita Cleery was appointed as the First Directress aided by Joyce Goonesekera, which position she held till Sr. M. John Bosco Curley succeeded her in 1961 . Sr. John Bosco worked with zeal to spread the Montessori Method.
A.M. Joosten visited Sri Lanka every year, presided at the Practical Examinations, Awarded Diplomas, visited the Childrens Houses affiliated to the Training Centre and conducted Lectures for those interested in Montessori Education until his death in 1980. 
Joyce Goonesekera continued to work unstintingly for the Children of Sri Lanka, opening Childrens Houses in many parts of the island. Many students who studied at these childrens houses and now adult would witness what a strong and important foundation as children they received by going through the AMI Montessori education. In recognition of her work for the children and the young girls Joyce was presented the Deshabandu Title by the Government.
AMI Training in Sinhala
Initially there was a crying need for Montessori education in Sinhala as the course was conducted only in English. 
In 1963 Srs. John Bosco and Stanislaus Vas visited Mario with the intention of requesting permission for a course to be conducted in Sinhala and for Dr. Montessoris Book The Secret of Childhood  to be translated into Sinhala. 
Sr. Stanislaus did not return to Sri Lanka but stayed on in Calcutta , India to do her Trainers Training under Mr. A.M. Joosten, to join the Staff of the Good Shepherd Training Centre on her return in 1964. The first ever course in Sinhala was started with 14 students and it continues to date with the numbers increasing every year. 
In 1976 Sr. John Bosco was succeeded by Sr. Stanislaus Vas as Directress of the Training Centre. Sr. John Bosco returned to Ireland in 1986 and in 1994 she was called to her Eternal Reward. 
In 1985 Sr. Benildus was appointed as the Directress of the Training Centre and under her leadership Training Centre celebrated the Golden Jubilee of Montessori work in Sri Lanka in 1994. This took place with great pomp and pageantry. She was again succeeded by Sr. Stanislaus Vas in 1994 and she continues to lead the Training Centre to date. 
The large number of our Montessori diploma holders are working in the many childrens Houses that have come into existence in Sri Lanka , some opening their own Childrens Houses. Others have gone further a field and are devoting themselves to the service of children in various parts of the world. Some others are working in the Primary Departments of the Public and International Schools and their services are much appreciated, says Rev. Sr. Stanislaus Vas, the present Directress of Montessori Training Centre. 
Our beginnings were small as we conducted lectures in St. Bridgets Montessori House of Children, after School hours. With gratitude we acknowledge the generosity of our benefactors Mr. & Mrs, Ananda Senarath for we now have a beautiful two storied building where we have our lectures and demonstration classes, since then we have had more extensions with a Practice class , a library and an atrium, yet again through the generosity of another benefactor Sr. Vas elaborated. 
It is not enough for the teacher to love the child. She must first love and understand the universe. She must prepare herself, and truly work at it. <U+2015> Dr. Maria Montessori

A TRIBUTE TO MY PAPA AUGUSTINE PAIVA ON HIS 100th Birthday, April 24, 2017

Proverbs 20: 7. The lovers of God will walk in integrity, and their children are fortunate to have Godly parents as their examples.
This portrays my father and mother. Papa loved God. He walked in integrity, was soft spoken, humorous, faithful, committed, kind, loving and a generous soul.
His love for Classical Music was shared at very loud decibels.
Sometimes we were lulled to sleep and at other times the springs of our beds vibrated as the crescendos peaked, which almost tossed us out of our beds, all to the rhythms of, Tchaikovsky, Chopin, Beethoven and the other great composers.
There was a time he played polo on horseback, but after he was thrown off his horse he did not dare the game again.
He enjoyed carpentry and my two brothers benefited by his experienced tutoring. He did create some items for our home, and together we made a beautiful bed for my doll.
We traversed this island exploring towns, rivers, wild life and more, when all eight of us were bundled into the old Humber Hawk. Charades was a household game in which he was skilled, which added to our shrieks of laughter.


Pa was passionate about gardening and the profusion of blossoms and foliage gave our home a delightful setting. It beckoned to people who lingered in the garden and wanted to use it as a back drop for their photos. After his time Mama continued to tend and keep it as beautiful. Papa loved to dress his daughters, grew roses and with pride, would pin them, and adorn our heads.
He was a keen photographer and won several awards for his beautiful photos. Many a time his models were us children and our friends. There was one breath-taking shot he took of my sister Cecelia hanging from our roof on a cable, in her beautiful tutu, holding a very thick rope that was coiled and extended to the ground.
He called it the Rope Trick. Mum was fluttering around and so were we, terribly afraid, for my sister, who was confidently smiling suspended in midair from above, for the photo shoot.
He was very innovative, and as a schoolboy created a steam engine that won the 1st prize. He also created world class mechanized displays for his showcases at Victoria Stores, Colpetty at Christmas time, and many were enthralled by it.


He motorized mums foot machine when she got pregnant. And this was before electrical sewing machines came to Sri Lanka.
My parents were peace makers and listened and advised many young people, who came to them for advice. Our home was a shelter for many who wanted solace for a while.
But one thing that was carved into my mind and remained in my heart was his love for God.
He would be found daily at mass at the Chapel at St. Bridgets Convent, which was across the road.
All of us children had to follow the model of daily mass from the age of sever years till we left home. But what challenged me most, was, after mass, my Papa spent time in silence, quietly communing with God for a long, long, period of time. I watched it for 16 years. I thank God for his godly example that challenged me and helped me to build up a relationship with God.
His investment in my life towards knowing God is something I will cherish always. I hope I have passed on the baton to my children and my childrens, children and the generations to come.
Proverbs 22: 6. Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.
THANK GOD FOR GODLY PARENTS.
Christine Gomez
Your loving daughter, who will not forget

The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) today urged the government to hold a referendum and seek the peoples consent before signing any agreement to handover the Trincomalee Harbour to India.
It said the handing over of the harbour to India, which is aspiring to become another superpower, was similar to getting the fox to guard the henhouse.
India is our traditional enemy. Mahavamsa says how India invaded Sri Lanka and how Sri Lanka fought for freedom during the 2,600 years of history.

Importance of sustaining the current stock market momentum
	


After many months of pessimism, the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) appears to be heading towards a bull run. In April 2017, the All Share Price Index (ASPI) has appreciated by 7.8 percent while the S&P SL 20 Index has recorded a growth of 8.6 percent. Further on, foreign contribution to the total market turnover for the current year exceeded 50 percent after nine long years. 
Active foreign participation during the last four months is identified as the key contributor towards the current growth momentum. The significant increase in foreign appetite for bargains, especially fundamentally strong stocks, attracted interest back into the market and boosted the market sentiments.
Analysts identify the revival in the market as long overdue and local investors are expected towww return to the buying side and sustain the upward trajectory. Thus, it is important to question if our readers are well poised to maximize the returns amidst the current market conditions. The article will shed light on market performance and the role of local investors.
Foreign contribution to the total market exceeded 50 percent, a net foreign inflow of Rs.14.2 billion.
As the overseas appetite for local stocks steadily increase, foreign contribution to the total market turnover has exceeded 50 percent in 2017 for the first time since 2008 (51.1 percent) Further on, net foreign inflow for the current year stands at Rs.14.2 billion. Differently stated, foreign purchases exceed foreign sales by Rs.14.2 billion. 
The Sri Lankan stock exchange is seen as a profitable investment destination by the United States of America and Europe. Foreign purchases from the USA exceeded Rs.8 billion while European funds/investors have invested Rs.6 billion during the current year.
Upward trend in market indices
A structural break in the long losing streak of the ASPI and the S&P SL 20 Index was witnessed during the end of March 2017. By April 2017, the ASPI grew by 7.8 percent while the S&P SL 20 Index followed a similar upward trend and recorded a growth of 8.6 percent. During the current year, the ASPI and S&P SL 20 Index have grown by 5 percent and 6.9 percent, respectively.
The S& P SL 20 Index outperforming the ASPI signals the appetite for fundamentally strong stocks by foreign investors. Such a trend is beneficial in terms of sustaining the current momentum. Further on, the growth of the total value of the market (market capitalization) in 2007 stands at Rs.130 billion.
Maximizing returns in market
The sluggish market performance during the recent past was followed by aimless accusations directed at the government and capital market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC). In a bull market, many come forward to claim responsibility but when winds of change divert the direction of the market no one seems to be responsible.
At this juncture, it is important to bear in mind that market downturn was greatly driven by unfavourable global economic conditions, upward movement in interest rates in the country, depreciation of the rupee, uncertainty of introducing a capital gain tax on the capital market, political ambiguity in the domestic arena, etc.
The gradual revival in the global economy, predominantly in the USA coupled with attractive stock prices in the CSE paved the way towards increased foreign investment. It is imperative for the local investor community, both retail and funds to enter the market to grab the opportunities arising from attractive valuations. For example, a stock (one of the largest listed entities) that was trading at Rs.140 in January early this year is currently trading at Rs.159-160.
Drive behind attractive valuations
A study on the movement of foreign funds highlights the ability of foreigners to maximize returns in volatile markets. Usually, foreign buying increases during market downturn and selling increases when prices increase. This could be further elucidated with reference to Figure 4.
When the ASPI decreased by 6.7 percent in 2007 foreign purchases increased and net foreign inflow stood at Rs.11.2 billion. When the market continued to be sluggish in 2008 with a negative growth of 42 percent, the market absorbed a net foreign inflow of Rs.14 billion. Subsequently, a reversal in foreign contribution was observed as Sri Lanka marked the end of the civil war and the market experienced an upward trajectory. It was during this period local investors actively participated in the market.
Accordingly, when the market experienced a steep growth of 126 percent and 96 percent in 2009 and 2010, foreigners exited the market and net foreign outflow for the aforesaid period stood at of Rs.789 million (2009) and Rs.26 billion (2010). When prices sky rocketed foreigners exited the market to maximize their returns while local investors blindly purchased such shares at overvalued prices. When foreign investment is driven by attractive valuations and fundamental analysis local investors are overwhelmed by impulsive investing.
At present, analysts believe that valuations at the CSE are close to post-war bottoms. Prudent investing compels local investors to actively participate in the current market momentum. They are expected to base their intelligent investment decisions on solid reasoning and analysis. Remember that intelligent investing is value investing (acquiring more than what you are paying for). You must value the business in order to value the stock.
Price is what you pay; value is what you get
Local funds are expected to play a crucial role in maintaining the growth momentum. Unfortunately local funds including the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) and Employees Trust Fund (ETF) continue to be inactive. It was reported last week that the EPF had purchased stocks of only nine listed companies during last year. Ideally funds should provide direction to the market by purchasing fundamentally strong stocks. Regrettably, certain state-owned funds in the past failed to observe such an approach and instead were driven by ulterior motives.  
On the other hand, the retail investors should bear in mind the heavy price the market and its participants paid during 2011/2012. In an upward market price movement of most stocks might seem lucrative. Positive investor sentiments and increased liquidity in the market might pave the way towards realizing short-term gains by entering penny stocks.
At first glance, the reason for this is the fact that penny stocks appear to fluctuate tremendously in price. Investors believe that they might have an opportunity to generate a very high return quickly by artificially manipulating certain stocks. Such unhealthy trading practices will expose ones portfolio to unwanted risk and above all erode investor confidence. It is pivotal to bear in mind that at the bottom line of a robust market is investor confidence.
Large short-term profits can often entice those who are new to the market. But adopting a long-term horizon and dismissing the get in, get out and make a killing mentality is a must for any investor. This doesnt mean that its impossible to make money by actively trading in the short term. But, investing and trading are very different ways of making gains from the market. Trading involves very different risks that buy-and-hold investors dont experience. As such, active trading requires certain specialized skills.
However, it is noteworthy to mention here that the market has not observed an unusual price movement in penny stocks during the current upward trend.
Salient role of government
The government should play a salient role in introducing policies to maintain the market momentum. It was widely discussed by the government to list certain non-strategic government investments that have potential for growth. The aforesaid stance was restated in the national budgets for the year 2016 and 2017. Market analysts believe that attracting these entities to the market would boost liquidity. Nevertheless, the policy continues to be in the pipeline. 
Further on, the government should express its interest in encouraging certain profitable government institutions (Bank of Ceylon, Insurance Corporation, Peoples Bank, etc.) to list on the exchange. It is suggested to list around 10 percent of the governments stake. Such initiatives would not only increase productivity and transparency in the government sector but be beneficial to the market in general. There is a misconception in society that such strategies would amount to privatization. Privatization requires the government to divest a stake of more than 51 percent. Yet, in the given context, the government will continue to retain 90 percent of the ownership.
As the regulator, the mandate of the SEC is not to push up the market up or pull the market down but to adopt prudent measures to curtail market malpractices and create a level playing field where the interest of the investors will be protected. It is important for the SEC to clearly perceive its role and take on stringent measures to avoid the grave mistakes made in 2010/2011.
Wrapping up
As foreign investors continue to benefit from the market, the local investors are expected to optimize the lucrative opportunities in the market. Thereby, the investors are expected to play a prudent role in sustaining the upward growth trajectory by investing wisely and vigilantly.

Meethotamulla: Japanese experts present report to President
	
The Japanese Experts Group presented their report on Meetotamulla Garbage Dump to President Maithripala Sirisena today at the Presidents Official Residence in Colombo.
Head of the Experts Group, Mitsutake Numahata handed over the report and made a power-point presentation explaining the recommendations of the group.
He said as a short term measure, the garbage dump should be stabilized to ensure there would not be further collapses. Before the onset of the monsoon the shape of the dump should be streamlined and the base should be covered with polythene. As a secondary measure, the shape of the dump should be made symmetrical with a broad base to ensure proper distribution of the gravity.
The experts group also proposed long term measures to remove the dump by adopting 3-R system of reduce, reuse and recycle.
President Sirisena thanked the Japanese Experts Group for undertaking a comprehensive study within days of the disaster and said that the Japanese expertise would be useful to solve the major issue of garbage in Sri Lanka. He pointed out that although the Meetotamulla disaster began as a human tragedy, now the garbage has become a political issue. He said the need for a lasting solution to the issue and sought continued support from Japan for this endeavour.
Ministers Susil Premajayantha, Anura Priyadarshana Yapa and Patali Champika Ranawaka and Japanese Ambassador Kenichi Suganuma were also present on this occasion.

Pro-SAITM Ads: GMOA to complain to FCID against Rajitha, Kiriella
	
The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) said today it would complain to the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) on the use of state funds by Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne to publish advertisements on SAITM.
GMOA Secretary Navin de Zoysa said the two ministers were publishing advertisements favourable to SAITM which was a private institution.
He said it was unethical for the ministers to protect a fraudulent private institution by spending state funds.
Dr. de Zoysa said it was a matter of surprise to find the government misusing public resources when such action by the previous government was under investigation.
We feel that the government has aggravated the SAITM issue through pro-SAITM proposals mentioned in the advertisements, he said.
Dr. de Zoysa said what the two ministers should do was not to publish advertisements on behalf of the SAITM but to publish advertisements with their own money apologizing for the people for failing to reveal correct information in courts.
He said the GMOA hoped that the President would pay attention to the misuse of state funds. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Reduce price of special arrack: Labour minister
	
Labour Minister W.D. J. Seneviratne today proposed a price reduction on a bottle of special arrack despite a decrease in government revenue by way of taxes.
He said this at Ratnapura District Coordinating Committee meeting which was held today.
This proposal was supported by Ratanapura District UNP Parliamentarian A. A. Wijetunga and UNP Provincial Councillor Siripala Kiriella.
The minister said a large number of people engaged in manual labour consume this brand of arrack.
With the price of a bottle of arrack rising to Rs.1,500, they are compelled to find cheap alternatives such as Kassippu or other illicit liquor, he said.
He said many estate workers, men and women are known to be addicted to 'kassippu' and added that his proposal might arouse much discussions among the people but whatever said and done we have to face reality. (Ajithlal Shantha Udaya)

## Title: Socrates: Could have been better

Socrates: Could have been better
	
Jayalath Manorathna in a scene from Socrates

It was a delight to see the name Socrates on a billboard, advertising a play with Jayalath Manoratne playing the Greek philosopher, who was sentenced to death, accused of corrupting the minds of the young.
It is a bold theme nowadays for the Sinhala theatre, which looks pedestrian and small-minded, having lost almost its entire capacity to take on intellectual themes and classics from the international stage.
The staging of Shakespeares Hamlet in Sinhala last month was a rare glimmer of hope but one misses Sugathapala de Silva and Marat-Sade on the one hand and Henry Jayasena and Hunuwataye Kathawa on the other. In that context, a play which can take on a big idea is welcome indeed.
Socrates is neither a translation nor an adaptation of a foreign play. The script has been written by Prof. Sunanda Mahendra and the play directed by Nimal Ekanayake, with music by Navaratne Gamage.
The cast included Wasantha Wittachchi, Chamila Pieris, Lal Kularatne, Sanjeewa Dissanayake, Richard Manamudali, Susil Wickremasinghe and others.
Unfortunately, this production leaves much to be desired. Some of the dialogues were delivered too rapidly and hence unintelligible. The play focuses on key events in the latter part of Socrates life, but fails to come alive. The use of masks in several scenes reinforces the sense of a classical Greek tragedy, but such devices cannot make up for the lack of dramatic force.
The Clouds, a satirical comedy by Aristophanes, is central to the plot of Socrates. There are three contemporary historical sources about Socrates  Aristophanes, Xenophon and Plato (Xenophon was a pupil of Socrates). Aristophanes was mostly negative about the philosopher, while Xenophon and Platowere positive.


For example, Aristophanes claimed that Socrates was a sophist and accepted money for his teaching, while the latter two both denied this. Aristophanes denied too, that Socrates died a martyrs death, while Xenophon said it was a voluntary suicide and Plato said that Socrates died as a hero for truth.
Aristophanes lampooned Socrates and Athenian intellectual fashions in his
play The Clouds.
Plato believed that the play was directly responsible for the trial and condemnation of Socrates. But other historical sources do not attribute such influence to the play, which was initially badly received by the public. According to one Greek source, when foreigners in the audience began asking who this Socrates was during a performance, the then middle-aged philosopher who was watching the play silently got up to answer that question.
Jayalath Manoratne as a very mature actor succeeds in getting under the skin of his role-that of a septuagenarian man of intellect puzzled that his ideas for a better world should earn the wrath of those who ruled.
It is a classic case of the individual against the State. But he was not a solitary individual; Socrates had a significant following, especially among the young, fed up with the
established order.


"Jayalath Manoratne as a very mature actor succeeds in getting under the skin of his role-that of a septuagenarian man of intellect puzzled that his ideas for a better world should earn the wrath of those who ruled. "


He was a rebel without a politically volatile ism. Instead of workers stomachs, Socrates wants to bring relief to the brains of a new generation starved of new ideas. But the ruling class is rattled by his ideas.
The trouble is that Manoratne does not physically fit the Socrates, we know from historical sources. It is generally accepted that he came from the lower classes. His father was a stone mason. As a young man, he was a soldier in the Athenian army, part of its armoured infantry. Though a short figure, he must have been physically very strong, and his bravery is attested for by contemporary sources.
Manoratne does not fit this description. He looks erudite, which he should be. But you cant believe hed ever been a soldier, nor is there any reference to that part of Socrates life. There is one effective scene where two parents, who put their son under Socrates tutelage, are shocked when the son returns home as a madman.
This episode with its surrealistic mood is the best in the entire play. But other scenes do not match up to this, and the use of stage props and lighting leaves much to be desired.
One should be glad that a production of this magnitude has been undertaken, but one could also wish it could have been better.

Tory lead is slashed in half after tax U-turnewsdx
	
DAILY MAIL, 23rd APRIL, 2017 - Theresa Mays hopes of winning a landslide Election victory suffered a major blow last night after her poll lead plummeted to 11 per cent amid the row over her tax and pensi on plans.
A Survation poll for The Mail on Sunday put the Conservatives on 40 per cent, followed by Labour on 29 per cent and the Lib Dems and Ukip level on 11 per cent.
It means Mrs Mays lead over Jeremy Corbyn has nearly halved in four days: a poll immediately after she called the Election gave the Tories a 21-point advantage.
Polling expert Professor John Curtice said the Survation figures would give Mrs May a Commons majority of 46, an improvement on her current working majority of 17, but way below some forecasts of a 140-seat majority.
The Conservative slump follows the threat to drop existing pledges not to increase tax and to guarantee a minimum 2.5 per cent annual rise in pensions.
The backlash was further fuelled by Mrs Mays surprise announcement that she will not abandon the Partys controversial promise to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on overseas aid. The Mail on Sunday poll is the only one to have been conducted after all three stories broke, and shows voters are less likely to vote Tory as a result.
The Prime Minister spurned three opportunities yesterday to contradict claims that she will drop David Camerons 2015 Election pledge not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT until 2020.
Put on the spot repeatedly at an election hustings in Dudley, West Midlands, she avoided giving a direct answer, merely stressing the Tories were a party of low taxation.

What you should know about solar panels
	
Solar panels may seem to appear as new devices which will soon be installed in many households in Sri Lanka. Although this concept is not so new to Colombo and its suburbs, effective usage of solar panels would be beneficial for users on the long run.
Heres an insight in to solar panels and what you need to know when using them:
A solar panel refers to a panel designed to absorb the sun's rays as a source of energy for generating electricity or heating. They are made of photovoltaic (PV) cells, which turn sunlight into electricity. This electricity can then be fed into your home's mains electricity supply. A photovoltaic (PV) module is a packaged, connect assembly of typically 610 photovoltaic solar cells. Photovoltaic modules constitute the photovoltaic array of a photovoltaic system that generates and supplies solar electricity in commercial and residential applications.
Most solar modules are currently produced from crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells made of multicrystalline and monocrystalline silicon. In 2013, crystalline silicon accounted for more than 90 per cent of worldwide PV production, while the rest of the overall market is made up of thin-film technologies using cadmium telluride, CIGS and amorphous silicon.
Facts about solar panels / solar photovoltaic systems
Solar panels have been around for a long time : Solar panels are a well-proven technology first invented in 1954 by scientists at Bell Labs. Today, solar panels are installed in many homes around the world and in Sri Lanka as well.
High durability : Solar panels are made of tempered glass and is designed to withstand rain and windy atmosphere. Since there are unpredictable weather patterns in Sri Lanka this is a great advantage for users. They can even extend the life of your roof by protecting it from daily wear and tear.
Could be installed anywhere : Sri Lanka is a country that receives sunlight all year round and therefore solar panels could be installed anywhere in the island.
Long lasting period :Most solar panel manufacturers offer a 25-year power production warranty guaranteeing that their solar panels will continue to generate electricity at a certain capacity for the warrantys duration.
Decrease carbon footprint : Installing solar panels can decrease your households carbon footprint by an average of 35,000 pounds of carbon dioxide per year.
Recycling process :Most parts of a solar module can be recycled including up to 95% of certain semiconductor materials or the glass as well as large amounts of ferrous and non-ferrous metals.
United Tractors is one source that provides a fully integrated approach to electric power in Sri Lanka. As means of conserving energy, many large scale buildings and industrial facilities are powered by Cat Generators while five star hotel chains and hospitals rely on Cat power.
