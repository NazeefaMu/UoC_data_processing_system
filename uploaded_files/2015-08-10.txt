BOCs Fortune branches lead way in industry standards transformation
	
In its history spanning 76 years, the No.1 Bank in Sri Lanka, the Bank of Ceylon has always stayed true to its mandate of being the Bankers to the Nation.?
As it enters into its next phase of evolution, the bank has embarked on an ambitious transformation journey named ?Wenesa? to further enhance its leadership position and to offer its customers unparallel customer service.?The transformation program covers multiple facets of the bank and aims at building the bank?s capabilities to provide its valued customers unmatchable and best in class banking services across the nation.
Branch transformation is one of the key pillars of this program wherein 200 branches across the island are being transformed into ?BOC Fortune Branches?. The bank has already established 5 such fully functional Fortune Branches. These fortune branches will completely change the paradigm of banking in Sri Lanka by setting new standards for customer service.?
As soon as one enters a BOC Fortune Branch the first thing one will notice is the new branch layout which is extremely spacious and aesthetically pleasing.
A new customer seating lobby has been designed to maximize customer comfort while transacting at a branch. Gone are the days where there would be long queues or frustrated customers rushing from one counter to another. Instead customers can be comfortably seated after obtaining a token number from the state of the art Queue Management Machine.?
During the short waiting period, customers can browse their smartphones or laptops by availing the free Wi-Fi access provided by the bank. Once the token number is called out and displayed on the mounted TVs, the customer can walk up to the new seated counters and get all their banking needs fulfilled in one sitting be it account opening, cash or cheque deposit, bill payment or any other inquiry.?
Another noticeable feature in the BOC Fortune Branches is the ?SmartZone?. This is a 24x7 fully digitized banking service area consisting of ATMs, Cash Deposit Machines and Internet Banking Kiosks. The new age Cash Deposit Machines have been witnessing phenomenal customer adoption at the BOC Fortune Branches, over 50% of the cash deposit transactions are now being carried out through these machines.?
In addition to the new branch layout, BOC Fortune Branches offer a revolutionary ?No Pass-book? saving account named ?BOC SmartGen?. This universal banking savings account allows customers the flexibility to transact at any BOC branch because their details including signature, identity and image will be captured digitally at the time of opening the account and will be updated to a centralized system instantly. BOC ?SmartGen? customer will also be able to enjoy free internet banking access, free instant SMS alerts on transactions and free monthly email statement. It should be noted that this product is the country?s first savings account which is fully active instantly upon opening of the account and customers can enjoy all said benefits from that moment the account?is opened.?
The bank has also streamlined internal processes at these BOC Fortune Branches so that all services can be delivered in the fastest possible time. These new processes have significantly reduced customer waiting time in branches. While speed of service has been ensured, the BOC Fortune Branches also focus on enhancing customer comfort. The new branches have a special lounge for customers who seek personal attention. These lounges allow customers to receive personalized attention from the Branch Manager whenever required.?
Branch Transformation is only one of the components of the ?Wenesa? program, which the bank has launched in partnership with the world leading consulting firm, The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) India Ltd. All aspects of this program seek to raise the bar on customer service and aim at ensuring that customers across the nation receive a world class banking experience when they bank with the Bank of Ceylon.

Ceylon Guardian sustains consistent performance in all portfolios
	
	Doubles external funds under management in client and unit trust business
Ceylon Guardian Investment Trust PLC recorded a profit after tax of Rs. 1.92 billion, given positive market conditions in 2014/15.?
The consolidated portfolio value increased to Rs.27.34 billion, from Rs.24.23 billion a year earlier; recording an appreciation of 15 percent when dividend payouts are factored in.?
Ceylon Guardian?s above average performance was attributed by the investment managers in their report to shareholders ?to booking of profits on selected overvalued stocks?.?
On highlighting the medium term performance inclusive of strategic holdings, five-year compounded annualized growth rate was 16.15 percent p.a. on portfolio value basis and 13.35 percent ?p.a. on market capitalisation, vis-?-vis an All Share Index growth of 12.86 ?percent p.a for the same five year period.?
The portfolio is managed by a professional team attached to Guardian Fund Management Limited, a company licensed by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka.
Whilst Ceylon Guardian?s own proprietary portfolio forms the anchor funds under management, the Ceylon Guardian Group has now diversified its capital market activity on three fronts ? namely client portfolio management, unit trust management (as a joint venture with Acuity Partners) and private equity management. Client portfolio management and unit trusts comprise the fee based business both of which are managed by SEC licensed fund management companies.?
The performance of the fixed income and equity unit trusts have been maintained above their respective benchmarks, with the equity fund in particular consistently outperforming the All Share Price Index, returning a total 69 percent gain to unit holders since its inception approximately three years ago (benchmark ASPI for the same period was 28.2 percent). Similarly its institutional client management business has provided consistent returns above benchmark for a range of clients including pension & provident funds and corporates.
Ceylon Guardian Chairman, I Paulraj comments that these businesses ?leverage our in house core investment management competencies to service customized institutional portfolios, as well as a wider base of corporate, high net worth and individual investors through the unit trust business which is carried out as a joint venture. Our fee earning assets under management currently amount to Rs.7.5 billion approx. ie, Rs. 3.5 billion in client portfolios and Rs.4 billion in mutual funds?, and this figure has doubled over the last one year. Guardian Group?s own proprietary portfolio amounts to Rs.27 billion.?
Commenting on private equity Guardian takes the view that PE is a necessary and complementary component of capital markets and that it plans to expand its presence in this segment through collaborative partnerships.
The fund manager?s report observes that ?our portfolio strategy, continued to support a selective investment process based on in depth research into the long term portfolio positions we hold. Performance highlights the long term track record of Ceylon Guardian taking into account different market cycles. Our view is that consistency and steadiness in portfolio performance is more important than intermittent superlative growth spurts since the Guardian portfolio is built for long term sustainability and continuity.?
Going forward, Ceylon guardian remains confident that the long term development potential of Sri Lanka will flow through to its capital markets if good policy measures are adopted to support economic activity and good governance. At national level this would involve stable and predictable economic indicators and a consistent policy framework governing private sector investment, whilst at corporate level aggressive growth strategies, profitable expansion and transparent management structures would warrant serious investor consideration.

Fitch affirms Ceylon Dollar Bond Fund at ?BB-?/?V-5?
	
		 		 
		 
			
Fitch Ratings has affirmed Ceylon Dollar Bond Fund?s Fund Credit Quality Rating?of ?BB-?.?
The Fund Volatility Rating is ?V-5?. The fund only invests in US dollar-denominated bonds issued by the Sri Lankan sovereign, licensed banks and corporate issuers. The fund is managed by Ceylon Asset Management (CAM). The ?BB-? Fund Credit Rating is driven by the weighted average rating factor (WARF) and rating distribution based on the expected composition of the fund and the fund?s investment guidelines.?
The rating also reflects the fund?s total assets which are currently placed in US dollar deposits at a local licensed commercial bank. The fund has limited investment space as it will only invest in US dollar bonds issued by the government of Sri Lanka, licensed banks in Sri Lanka and Sri Lankan corporates that are rated by an international rating agency. This limits the current investment space to 11 issuances totalling just over US$ 7 billion. The manager expects the allowable investor base to increase within the next three months, which would help the fund to attract significant investments.
The fund?s target portfolio comprises bonds rated ?BB-? or lower issued by the entities detailed above. The fund will invest up to 10 percent of its assets in US dollar fixed deposits in a licensed commercial bank in Sri Lanka. It is currently invested only in bank deposits with Deutsche Bank Sri Lanka, a branch of Deutsche Bank AG (A+/Negative/F1+).
As a result of the limited investment opportunities, Fitch expects the fund to be moderately concentrated. Consistent with the agency?s rating criteria, Fitch has therefore conducted stress tests on the expected portfolio. Based on its analysis, Fitch believes the fund has a limited capacity to withstand negative rating migration in its investments before it would be downgraded to the?
?B? category. The fund will invest in instruments with a relatively long maturity (WAL of 2.75 years in the target portfolio) except for an allocation of up to 10 percent to three-month deposits.?
The Volatility Rating of ?V-5? reflects the target portfolio?s relatively long WAL and a market risk factor (MRF) of 8.5. Fitch?s calculation of the fund?s MRF incorporates a weighting to take into account the volatility expected in lower-rated emerging market debt. According to Fitch?s criteria, funds rated ?V-5? are considered to have high sensitivity to market risk. On a relative basis, total returns and/or changes in net asset value are expected to experience substantial variability across a range of market scenarios due to substantial exposure to interest rates, credit spreads and other risk factors. Fitch considers CAM suitably qualified, competent and capable of managing the fund.?
Fitch will review the fund after six months to see if the fund has achieved an appropriate level of diversification, consistent with its target portfolio and investment guidelines as indicated by the manager. If the fund fails to gain a considerable size within this period, Fitch will withdraw the rating as it would no longer be relevant to Fitch?s coverage.
Fitch has capped the fund?s rating at that of the Sri Lanka sovereign (BB-/Stable), given its expected material exposure to Sri Lankan sovereign bonds. Therefore upside potential for the fund rating is limited. To maintain the bond fund ratings, CAM will provide Fitch with portfolio information, including details of the portfolio?s holdings and credit quality. Fitch closely monitors the credit composition of the portfolio, the credit counterparties used by the manager, and the overall market risk profile of the investments.

SC calls for SA report on MR
	
	The Supreme Court today directed the Attorney General to submit a the Security Assessment (SA) report issued by the State Intelligence Service on former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
	The SC issued this direction when the fundamental rights petition -- urging the removal of the perks and privileges enjoyed by Mr. Rajapaksa as former president now that he is a candidate at the general election -- was taken up for hearing.
	Petitioner Senaka Perera, who is a national list nominee of the Nawa Sama Samaja Party (NSSP) in his petition sought an order to remove all the police security given to former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and suspend all the privileges including houses, offices and vehicles given to him by the State in the wake of his candidature at the general election.
	The three-judge-bench comprising Chief Justice K. Sripavan and Justices Priyasath Dep and Anil Goonaratne further directed the petitioner to make a request from the Election Commissioner for appropriate security, if he needs security for any threat.
	The petition was re-fixed for support on August 14.
	Deputy Solicitor General Nerin Pulle appearing for the AG informed Court that security personnel assigned to the former president was based on the Assessment of Security Threat by the State Intelligent Service.

	He said Mahinda Rajapaksa was given excessive security and privileges well beyond the other former presidents and that some of the privileges and security has been divulged in parliament -- 105 police personnel, 14 army officers and many other personnel and other infra structure facilities and a lucrative state-funded pension.

Two awards will be given ? one to the most creative till in Sri Lanka and the other, for the till with the highest amount of cash which has been saved for the duration of the competition. Apart from the main prizes, a creative till winner will be selected from every branch around the country and rewarded with Rs. 5,000 Tikiri gift voucher while all participants will receive a Rs. 100 savings deposit to their Tikiri account from the bank. The competition is open to both existing and new ?Seylan Tikiri? Account Holders below 10 years of age.
?Creativity and out-of-the-box thinking is crucial in a child?s formative years and it is precisely this which Seylan Bank hopes to inculcate through this children?s competition. In a world where technology has taken precedence, creativity and simple innovation sometimes suffers and we hope that this competition will provide a much needed impetus to encourage originality among children,? said Tilan Wijeyesekera, Deputy General Manager ? Marketing and Personal Banking, Seylan Bank, speaking about the significance of the competition.?
Wijeyesekera highlighted the importance of inculcating a mind-set of saving in children at a young age in order to prepare for the future. ?Encouraging values such as saving among children helps build a strong financial foundation for them in their later years. The till was once an omnipresent object in every household at one point in time and an integral part of a family household which resulted in savings being an inevitable part of a child?s life. ?This competition will help in revitalizing the nostalgic fondness for the savings till while encouraging children to start saving for the future.?
Seylan Bank?s minor savings scheme, ?Seylan Tikiri?, has a history spanning 23 years and is one of the most sought after children?s savings accounts in Sri Lanka. It offers a benefits based savings scheme for children. Gifts for accountholders vary from video game pads, organs, scooters and remote controlled helicopters to bicycles, tabs and LED TVs, depending on their account balance. The Seylan Bank Creative Till Competition will conclude on 05th September 2015.

Some would-be law makers break the law- EC
	
	Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya said that parliament was responsible for the enactment of laws for the benefit of the people, but that the very people who were hoping to enter parliament were breaking the law during this election period.
	During this election, police were enforcing the law properly. But some seemed to be displeased by this and criticised the officials saying they were implementing laws that were never in existence, he said.
	He made these observations during an awareness programme held in the auditorium of the Chilaw Divisional Secretariat and organised by the Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission, to educate the OICs and senior police officers of the North Western Province about the duties of the police -- in order to ensure a free and fair election .
	He asked the police not to hesitate to use appropriate force when necessary, irrespective of the party concerned, and whether it was led by Mahinda, Ranil, Anura Kumara or Sampanthan.
	"Can we go to the Human Right Commission when we are obstructed in the pursuit of our duties?" Mr. Deshapriya asked, noting the complaints to the HRC against school principals who had punished their pupils. "The Human Rights Commission should look into matters that affect our rights as well," he said.
	"Some ministers have complained to us about drunken police officers dismantling their election offices and assaulting their supporters. We should try to avoid such complaints and enforce the law impartially,". he said.
	"Police powers prevail during an election period. Use them properly at the proper time, as you have been empowered to do by parliament. Regrettably those who hope to enter parliament also break the law," he said.
	"By 8.00 am on Friday all the elections offices of the candidates, excepting one office for each candidate in a district, should be closed. Up to the 18th, posters and banners may be displayed only at these offices, he said.
	He told the police and elections officers to remove any unauthorised posters (carrying pictures of politicians), in their entirety, instead of mutilating them. "Ensure a law abiding country for our children," he urged the police.
	Ravi Wijegunawardena, Senior DIG (North Western and North Central Provinces) and Nimal Punchihewa, legal advisor to the Human Rights Commission, also spoke. (Augustine Fernando)

Special court to hear cases of abuse against women: Ranil
	
	The United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG) will set up a special court to hear cases on harassment of women, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe said at a weekend meeting at Morawaka.
	He said this was being done to expedite the process of bringing culprits to book.
	The Prime Minister said a UNFGG government would also enact a Women's Rights Bill to pave the way to the setting up of a National Woman's Rights Authority.
	He said the serial killings at Kahawatte had given rise to the need for such laws. The Prime Minister asked the people whether they remembered the bogey about grease yakkas who preyed on helpless women.
	He said he had given Matara district UNP candidate Sagala Ratnayake the opportunity to solve unemployment issues in the area. Sri Lankan cricketer Sanath Jayasuriya's mother and singers Rukantha Gunatilleke and Saman de Silva were also on the stage.
	An Iguana was seen crawling into the site of the UNFGG rally last morning.
	Mr. Wickremasinghe who spotted the reptile said it should not be harmed. " Let it go, that's Dallas Alahaperuma," he was heard saying in lighter vein.(Yohan Perera)

Obstructing poll campaign: Sujeewa files FR petition
	
Deputy Justice Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe today filed a fundamental rights petition in the Supreme Court seeking an order directing the police to take disciplinary action against the sergeant who Mr. Senasinghe claimed to have blocked a truck that was being used in his election campaign.
The petitioner said the truck had speakers fixed on it for the purpose of canvassing and that it was in line with the Elections Commissioner?s permission for candidates to use speakers for electioneering.
He said the truck was parked at Athurugiriya when the Sergeant who had arrived in a police jeep parked it across the road thus preventing the truck being moved.
The petitioner said the sergeant had also threatened to arrest the truck driver.
He said the sergeant was under the influence of liquor and that he had informed the Mirihana SSP to do a spot check to confirm and verify the petitioner?s complaint.
The petitioner sought a compensation of Rs.5 million from the respondents cited including the IGP and five others. (Lakmal Sooriyagoda)
