H'tota Port Project -- Cabinet approves agreement again
	
The controversial framework agreement on the Hambantota Port Development Project (HPDP) was approved by Cabinet for the second time yesterday after the introduction of amendments, Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
He said the amendments provided for the abrogation of the agreement on the consent of both parties and provided for the introduction of further amendments if necessary.
The HPDP was signed on Saturday.
The minister told a news breifing that President Maithripala Sirisena and Cabinet ministers submitted further amendments before the agreement was finally approved.
The President wanted to include a clause allowing for amendments in the future. The Finance Minister proposed that both parties to the agreement must be under obligation to all the clauses of the agreement. The Attorney General introduced amendments to strengthen the hold by the Sri Lanka Ports Authoritys (SLPA), he said.(Sandun A Jayasekera)

He is only raring to make a dramatic exit!
	
A Green party deputy has begun breathing fire and brimstone at high-ups in both main political parties.

Finding that the deputy was going too far, the party authorities had told him to leave the party if he was unhappy instead of tongue-lashing even the party high-ups while staying pat in the party. However, that admonition could not bridle the deputys sharp tongue.
Meanwhile, some sections in the party started wondering whether the deputy meant business or simply staging an act. And some of them while making discreet inquiries stumbled on the reason why the deputy had suddenly gone gung ho: he was only paving the way for a young man from a prominent political family in the Gampaha district to enter the political arena.
The young man whose mother, grandfather and grandmother held high political office in the country had got disgusted with politics when his father who too was a high profile political figure was assassinated. However, he has now given his consent to enter national politics from his ancestral bastion. The deputy who is also closely related to this young man is quite willing to create the necessary vacuum in the Gampaha district for the young man to fill.
A former purohita hailing from Moratuwa too has given his blessings for this arrangement, they say.

This story is about two close relatives engaged in a protracted battle. Both are powerful characters at provincial level in the hill country. One is a male and the other a female.


The enmity between the two characters smoldering under the ashes for a long time has now come out into the open, they say.
Now a move is underway to impeach the lady by means of a no confidence motion to be adopted by the provincial body. Several heavyweights in the province have already expressed their support for the move. However, the lady remains unmoved assured of the blessings of the most powerful ones at the centre.

How to tackle an infection in the Urinary Tract
	


The urinary system is the bodys principle pathway of getting rid of the waste and certain components like ions and drugs that are present in the blood in excess amount. When the blood supplied to the kidney goes through the minuscule nephrons-the functional units of the kidney- blood is filtered into it. This is the process of producing urine. Some components (eg water, sodium) are reabsorbed into blood, while some (eg; ammonia, certain drugs) are secreted, forming the constituents of urine. The body has the ability to change the components of urine according to the circumstances, aiding the survival process. For an example, when a person is dehydrated, the body will produce a low volume of more concentrated urine, preserving the bodys precious water supply. The reverse will happen when you drink plenty of water. This increases the volume, causing you to increase the number of trips to the toilet. 
As is the case with the other systems of the body, infections can affect the urinary system also. Urinary Tract Infections (UTI) are divided into upper and lower UTI. Upper ones are the infections in the kidneys (Pyelonephritis) and infections in the ureters, (though those are extremely rare). Lower UTIs are the infections in the bladder (cystitis) and infections in the urethra (urethritis). Well be focusing more on lower UTI in this article because they are more common. 
During any infection in any part of the body, a pathogen enters the system and multiplies. This causes the symptoms to develop. It can enter the specific system either through an orifice; in this case the urethra or through blood. It enters the urinary system and multiplies there, causing the symptoms to appear. But there are many protective mechanisms to prevent a pathogen from reaching its target, like the protective epithelium of the urethra and the bodys immune reactions. A pathogen has to pass through all these barriers to ultimately cause the infection in our body. 
Symptoms of a lower UTI usually includes pain while passing urine, gives the urine a cloudy colour and a foul smell, increases the frequency of urination (called urgency), causes lower abdominal tenderness and cramping. In addition, symptoms like fever, nausea and vomiting, generalized body aches and back pain can also be present. 

Who are those vulnerable
Anyone can get a UTI, but lets take a closer look at those who are more vulnerable. Females get UTI more often than males. The principle reason for this is the anatomical difference between the sexes. The female urethra is shorter than the males, so a pathogen that enters through the urethral opening of a female has a shorter journey before establishing in the body. Therefore males are less likely to get UTIs than females. Its also found that sexually active females have an even higher tendency of getting UTI. 
Pregnant females, elderly males having enlarged prostrates and people who have indwelling urinary catheters are at higher risk. In addition, kidney stones and diabetes also increase your risk of UTI.

What you should do
In an infection, pathogenic organisms in the urine cause irritation in the bladder. This results in the frequent urge to urinate and gives a cramping type of pain. In most cases these infections may only give out mild symptoms and will disappear in a few days. In these more milder cases, you are advised to follow the method called watchful waiting, otherwise known as the wait and see approach. Drink plenty of fluids, and empty your bladder frequently in order to help flush out the pathogens from the system. Limit your intake of coffee, alcohol, nicotine and spicy food, because these will further irritate the bladder, causing the symptoms to worsen. Stay alert and seek medical care in the following circumstances.

UTI in children
Its difficult to diagnose UTI in children because of their inability to verbalize the symptoms. But in case of an infant, who is crying constantly, have fever with pungent smelling, cloudy or unusual colored urine, a UTI can be suspected and medical advice should be sought. 
When washing the perineal area of a girl, always wipe from front to back instead of back to front to avoid introducing gut bacteria into the urinary tract. 
If your child is having frequent UTIs, make sure to mention the fact to your pediatrician on your next visit. The UTI may be due to some abnormality in their urinary tract that needs further investigation. 


Pyelonephritis
Infection of the kidney or pyelonephritis, is a serious medical condition that may have long term repercussions like kidney damage and kidney stone formation. Therefore it needs immediate medical attention. The symptoms are high fever with chills and rigors, severe nausea and vomiting and flank pain. None of these symptoms should be ignored, Seek your doctor immediately if you are experiencing the above symptoms in addition to the usual UTI symptoms.

Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake, who appeared before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the Bond Issuance, said he did not know that the penthouse he and his family were residing in for nine months was paid for by the Perpetual Treasuries (PT) Pvt. Limited owned by Arjun Aloysius.
At the cross examination of the Judges at the Commission today, the Minister said he only came to know of the payments when the issue was raised in Parliament.
He said that Aloysius had paid cash through his company as the owner of the residence did not want to lease out the penthouse to a politician.
The Minister said he didnt play any role in the transaction and that his wife and the daughter were the ones who found the house.
"I knew nothing," he said.
When asked whether he knew Perpetual Treasuries was paying for the penthouse, he said he wouldnt have settled in the house had he known due to the conflict of interest.

Jester to stage a comeback
	

A former purohita who calls himself a direct descendant of King Dutugemunu is poised for yet another political somersault, they say.

The man from Ruhuna cut his political teeth as a Blue party activist. He later turned Green and again jumped back to the Blue party at the most opportune moment. His posture as a die-hard loyalist of the former strongman soon paid dividends when the man was elevated to the top team level. His shenanigans while functioning as the partys organizer in a sacred area close to the city drew such public reproof and repugnance, the Betel leaf bigwigs dared not giving him nomination at the last general polls. By the way, he had reviled the Green party so much, he could not approach that party either. Having thus been left out in the cold, the man remained out of public eye for some time.
Never content with being a nonentity, the man had recently sent in feelers to the Green leadership and had received a positive response, they say.
The Green leadership finding in him an ideal candidate to serve as an irritant in the side of the dominant political family in Giruwapattu is said to be planning to offer the turncoat a post of organizer in Tissamaharama area.
The Green chiefs plan to appoint the discredited politico as a party organizer is reportedly aimed at downing several birds with one stone. However, another Green stalwart who has already put down his roots in Ruhuna may not take kindly to this move, they say.
Meanwhile, some party seniors say that the Green chiefs proposed ploy is sure to blow up in his face like many of his previous ones.

Look younger with therapeutic anti-ageing
	

With extended life expectancy, beauty and skin care are important factors in improving the of quality of life. Currently, numerous interventions are offered to rejuvenate the skin. Anti-ageing includes treatments for facial wrinkles, facial muscle tone and elasticity. Recently, physical medicine has been introduced in treatments used for Facial rejuvenation. Facial ageing reflects the dynamic, cumulative effects of time on the skin, soft tissues and deep structural components of the Face. This is a complex synergy of textural changes in the skin and loss of facial volume. 
National Organizer of The Chartered Society of Physiotherapist Dr. Sujeewa Weerasinghe was good enough to educate readers on this complex issue by talking to the Health Capsule. 
Many of the facial manifestations of ageing reflect on the combined effects of gravity, progressive bone resorption, decreased tissue elasticity and redistribution of subcutaneous fullness. A convenient method of assessing the morphological effects of ageing is to divide the face into the upper third (forehead and brows), middle third (midface and nose) and lower third (chin, jawline, and neck). The midface is an important factor in facial aesthetics because perceptions of facial attractiveness are largely founded on the synergy of the eyes, nose, lips, and cheek bones (central facial triangle). Recent years have seen a significant increase in the number of nonsurgical procedures performed for facial rejuvenation. Such treatment has been obtained by patients seeking nonsurgical procedures, those requiring restoration of lost facial volume, those wishing to enhance normal facial features and those wanting to correct facial asymmetry. 
The appearance of the face and neck typically changes with age. Loss of muscle tone and thinning skin gives the face a flabby or drooping appearance. In some people sagging may create the look of the double chin, Dr. Weerasinghe said. 
What are the age related changes of the human face
1. Facial expressions are decreased. 
2. Tone and strength of muscles are decreased. 
3. Blood supply to the facial soft tissues are decreased. 
4. Due to decreased muscle mass and the increase of fat tissues weakens metabolism. 
5. Due to low production of oil skin may get drier. 
6. Due to gravity, facial movement and sleep position are the secondary factors that contribute to changes in the skin. When the skin loses its elasticity, gravity causes drooping of the eyebrows and eyelids, looseness and fullness under the cheeks and jaw (jowls and double chin) and longer ear lobes. 
Facial movement lines become more visible after the skin starts losing its elasticity (usually as people reach their 30s and 40s). Lines may appear horizontally on the forehead, vertically on the skin above the root of the nose (glabella), or as small curved lines on the temples, upper cheeks and around the mouth. 
Sleep creases result from the way the head is positioned on the pillow and may become more visible after the skin starts losing its elasticity. Sleep creases are commonly located on the side of the forehead, starting above the eyebrows to the hairline near the temples, as well as on the middle of the cheeks. Sleeping on your back may improve these sleep creases or prevent them from becoming worse. Smokers tend to have more wrinkles than nonsmokers of the same age, complexion, and history of sun exposure. 
Dry skin and itching is common in later life. About 85% of older people develop winter itch, because overheated indoor air is dry. The loss of oil glands as we age may also worsen dry skin. Anything that further dries the skin (such as overuse of soaps or hot baths) will make the problem worse. If your skin is very dry and itchy, see a doctor because this condition can affect your sleep, cause irritability, or be a symptom of a disease. Some medicines make the itchiness worse. Our skin is at the mercy of many forces as we age; sun, harsh weather and bad habits. But we can take steps to help our skin stay supple and fresh-looking, he said. 
Ageing of your skin depends on a variety of factors
This depends largely on your lifestyle, diet, heredity, and other personal habits. For instance, smoking can produce free radicals and make healthy oxygen molecules overactive and unstable. Free radicals damage cells and lead to, among other things, premature wrinkles. 
There are other reasons, too. Primary factors contributing to wrinkled, spotted skin include normal ageing, exposure to the sun and pollution and loss of subcutaneous support (fatty tissue between your skin and muscle). Other factors that contribute to ageing of the skin include stress, gravity, daily facial movement, obesity and even sleep position. 
Skin changes that come with age
As we grow older, changes like the following occur naturally: 
Skin becomes rougher. Skin becomes slack. The loss of elastic tissue (elastin) in the skin, with age, causes the skin to hang loosely. Skin becomes more transparent. This is caused by thinning of the epidermis (surface layer of the skin). 
Skin becomes more fragile. This is caused by a flattening of the area where the epidermis and dermis (layer of skin under the epidermis) come together. Skin becomes more easily bruised. This is due to thinner blood vessel walls. 
Changes below the skin also become evident as we age. They include: 
Loss of fat below the skin in the cheeks, temples, chin, nose and eye area. This may result in loosening skin, sunken eyes and give a skeletal appearance. Bone loss, mostly around the mouth and chin, may become evident after age 60 and cause puckering of the skin around the mouth. Cartilage loss in the nose causes drooping of the nasal tip and accentuation of the bony structures in the nose. 
Sun and facial Skin
Exposure to sunlight is the single biggest culprit in ageing skin. Over a period of time, the suns ultraviolet (UV) light damages certain fibers in the skin called elastin. The breakdown of elastin fibres causes the skin to sag, stretch and lose its ability to snap back after stretching. The skin also bruises and tears more easily and takes longer to heal. So while sun damage may not show when youre young, it will, later in life. 
Nothing can completely undo sun damage, although the skin can sometimes repair itself. So, its never too late to begin protecting yourself from sun exposure and skin cancer. You can delay changes associated with ageing by staying out of the sun, covering up, wearing a hat and making a habit of using sunscreen. 
Skeletal muscle is a fundamental organ in the generation of force and movement and helps in regulating the metabolism of the whole-body metabolism. It also makes provision for resiliency. Indeed, physical medicine and rehabilitation are recognized as essential for optimizing skeletal muscle health in the context of ageing (sarcopenia) and disease (cachexia). Exercise is will remain the cornerstone of therapies to improve skeletal muscle health. However, now there are a number of promising biologic and small molecule interventions currently under development to rejuvenate skeletal muscle, including my statin inhibitors, selective androgen receptor modulators and an activator of the fast skeletal muscle troponin complex. A Non-surgical Physical medicine solution has been introduced for facial rejuvenation. Developed drainage of waste products and increasing nutrition and the oxygen supply aids blood supply to the skin and muscles of the face. Therapeutic ultrasound treatment that stimulates every muscles of the face, Modified electrotherapeutic treatment together with facial strengthening exercises form the basic foundation for treatment, he added.

LTTE resurgence should be thwarted: IGP
	
The terrorism had not been eliminated completely from the country and the attempts made by the LTTE organisation to stage a comeback should be defeated at any cost, IGP Pujith Jayasundera said in Jaffna on Tuesday.
The IGP expressed these views during a discussion held with the religious leaders and civil society organisations at the Auditorium of the Jaffna Police station on Tuesday afternoon.
Though we say we have eliminated terrorism from the country, no one can make sure that seeds of terrorism had been removed completely. It is true that the weapons used by the terrorists were handed over in large number to the Government but it doesnt mean all the weapons had been handed over, he said.
He said the mindset of some of the former LTTE cadres had not been changed because of the rigorous training they have received.
We have to put an end to this now. The Police and the STF has ensured the security but we need the public assistance as well. The Police, the State officials and the residents should maintain better relationships to overcome this menace, he said.
Some extremists and organisations are attempting to portray a wrong picture about the situation in the North for their petty gains, using some media institutions. This is how the LTTE made its entrance back in the days. We shouldnt allow this to succeed, he said. (By Romesh Madushanka)

Maduro takes Venezuela into uncharted waters,
	

By Anthony Faiola, Heather Long 
(c) 2017, The Washington Post   Aug 01, 2017 - 
CARACAS, Venezuela - The Trump administration on Monday imposed sanctions on President Nicols Maduro, after an election that critics called a tipping point toward dictatorship. But even with international pressure building and Venezuelas economy collapsing, beleaguered opposition activists here were facing a stark new challenge. 
How could they confront a socialist machine that now controls all branches of government 
Citing Maduros outrageous seizure of absolute power, the U.S. government froze any American assets he may have and banned Americans from doing business with him. The move came after Maduro heralded the Sunday vote creating a new super-congress made up entirely of government backers. The newly cast legislators included his wife and son. The body will have sweeping powers to rewrite the constitution and redraw Venezuelas governing system. 
Maduro is not just a bad leader, said President Trumps national security adviser, H.R. McMaster. He is now a dictator. 
Despite the tough talk from the White House, the sanctions fell short of the crippling pressure many observers were expecting. Maduro swiftly dismissed the measures, saying on television that they were imposed because he didnt obey the North American empire. He added: Impose all the sanctions that you want, but Im a free president. 
Potentially more-sweeping measures - including the targeting of Venezuelas all-important oil industry - are still on the table. But the opposition here is running out of time to turn the tide, and is now facing new and significant threats. 
The election was boycotted by the opposition, and many Venezuelans mocked the governments contention that more than 40 percent of voters took part. Under Maduros mentor, the late leftist leader Hugo Chvez, many Venezuelans thought national election results were generally credible, although candidates complained that he used state resources to gain an edge. But opposition activists called Sundays vote a turning point, claiming that only about 12 percent of Venezuelans turned out, in what they called a historic rejection of Maduro and his plans. 
Luisa Ortega Daz, Venezuelas attorney general, who broke with the government in March, on Monday declared the vote fraudulent. She suggested that Maduro and his inner circle, including a vice president accused by the U.S. government of narco-trafficking, would now seek to use the new assembly to monopolize money and power. 
How will we control the public budget now How will we know how much and in what things money is being invested How amazing for them! she said. 
This is not the project Hugo Chvez wanted for the country, she continued. Far from it. 
Maduro has said he proposed the assembly to bring peace to the streets after four months of often-violent demonstrations protesting the dire state of the economy and growing authoritarianism.
Opponents said he skewed the system for choosing candidates to ensure control of the new body. 
On Thursday, those chosen for the new Constituent Assembly are set to replace the democratically elected members of the nations legislature, which is dominated by the opposition. Some opposition lawmakers defiantly went to the National Assembly building on Monday, vowing to keep carrying out their duties. It foreshadowed a potentially dramatic standoff.

Oppo F3: Reviewed
	
Whether youre an occasional selfie-snapper or an obsessive-life-documenting-selfie king/queen, you would know that there is an abundance of smartphones in the market in all ranges at the moment to cater your needs.
If you love your selfies, or if you've now discovered the world that is "groupies", then you should definitely take a look at the new Oppo F3. With it's dual front camera, this is a smartphone that just screams "selfie!".OPPO is one of those brands that continue to heavily invest in the said feature and one of their latest offerings is the OPPO F3.
The company has put its foot on the gas, advertising its new selfie centric phones on all kinds of platforms. Oppo even sponsors the Indian cricket team, All this is done on the back of a few phones, of which, the Oppo F3 and F3 Plus seem to be the forerunners. There are other phones in the companys arsenal as well, but at the moment the companys focus seems to be on selfies. Now, whether you want a selfie centric phone is up to you, but in our books, a phone should be more than just selfies.
Design & Build
Oppo went with what other major smartphone manufacturers are following, giving it a metal and glass casing.Unfortunately, Oppo seems to be unwilling to innovate on its design. The Oppo F3 is good looking, but not new.
The dimensions of the device are important to note: 163.6 x 80.8 x 7.4 mm, as well as the large diagonal of 6 inches. The smartphone weighs in at 185 grams, so it's a little on the heavy side in comparison to other smartphones these days, nevertheless, a little weight gives the phone a premium feel in the hand.
On the front panel you will immediately notice one of the more distinctive features of this smartphone: the dual camera for selfies. The two sensors are placed in the upper left corner, next to the speaker for voice calls and to the proximity sensor. In the lower part of the front panel is the circular home button, which also includes a fingerprint reader. The edges curve in slightly, thanks largely to 2.5D glass.
To launch the F3 Plus you'll have to rely on the physical button on the right-hand side next to the slot for microSD + nano SIM or two nano Sim (it's your choice as it is a hybrid Dual SIM). On the left-hand side you'll find the dedicated volume button, which isn't easy to reach if you have small hands. The headphone jack and micro-USB port (sorry, Oppo decided against the Type C option) are all along the bottom, next to the speaker.
Display
Equipped with a 6-inch IPS LCD screen, with Full-HD resolution (1920 x 1080 pixels). The screen is covered with Gorilla Glass 5 and has an integrated eye protection mode that helps by placing less strain your eyes when you read the night.
Under direct sunlight the display is - unfortunately - disappointing. In order for it to be visible you'll need to set the brightness to maximum, and reflections do not help when you're trying to view any content. The colors are a bit saturated and it's not possible to modify things in the settings, as here it's only possible to adjust the brightness.
User Interface
Android 6.0 Marshmallow with ColorOS 3.0 layered on top of it, which is my biggest gripe with this phone, why is a phone in 2017 still using a two-year-old OS Yes, the industry at large is doing it, but thats only a sign of OEMs taking advantage of lack of consumer awareness.
Other than that, ColourOS looks and tries to function like iOS. Its easy to understand and quite colourful. For the convenience of familiarity, the icons designs and the settings layout is very similar to iOS. However, the quick toggle menu is still a drop down from the top. Oppo has also included gestures and things like app cloning so that one can easily make use of dual SIMs to use dual Whatsapp accounts for example. There is a theme manager, a RAM booster app, lock-screen magazine feature, cloud backup and a secondary app store. The UI also offers a set of simple yet good looking apps for music, videos, clock, photos, weather, file manager and even email.
Performance
The Oppo F3 Plus is powered by a MediaTek MT6750T SoC octa-core CPU (8x1.5 GHz Cortex-A53), Mali-T860MP2. It comes with 4 GB of RAM plus 64 GB internal storage, though you can expand this up to 256 GB with a microSD card.
Based on the technical specifications, the F3 Plus is good to go for normal everyday use: there's no lagging or sudden crashes, apps open quickly enough and I didn't encounter any overheating when I played Real Racing 3. The browser can sometimes be a little slow, but overall the performance is really good. While the phone can handle almost all kinds of apps, one notices occasional stutters and sluggishness. This became quite apparent when I tried gaming on the phone. Games like Asphalt 8 ran at below 30 fps, while those that werent capped to 30fps, were usually getting as far as 40-45fps. Its not particularly unplayable, but the experience is sub-par to say the least. You see lags and frame drops often.

There were also occasional app crashes and the camera app sometimes takes a little more time to take a selfie, which is supposed to be the prime feature of this phone.
On the other hand, call quality is decent and audio volume via the single speaker at the bottom is adequate. But, like every other smartphone in the same price bracket, audio quality is nothing worth writing home about. Via headphones, the phone really shines and offers good overall output.
Selfies
The Oppo F3 Plus was the best selfie centric smartphone we tested this year and the Oppo F3 tries to imitate it. There is a similar 16MP + 8MP dual camera setup at the front for solo and group selfies respectively. Like the F3 Plus, the 16MP camera here has 76.4 degree FOV and the 8MP camera has 120 degree FOV. Even the f/2.0 aperture is kept the same. That said, there are differences in the camera quality. The F3 tends to shoot slightly oversaturated colours, whereas the colour captured by the F3 Plus are nearer to being neutral. However, quality of overall images, including details, dynamic range and depth of field, remains almost at par, with the F3 Plus edging ahead in some pictures.
On its own, the Oppo F3 has good details, colours are pleasantly oversaturated, and noise is kept to acceptable levels. Photos are slightly soft, to remove skin blemishes and make selfies look better, but whether you like that will be a subjective opinion.
The Oppo F3 not only captures better details and colours in normal lighting conditions, but does a better job overall in low light as well. Photography enthusiasts may still find images lacking proper details and softer focus is somewhat annoying. But, at the end of the day, the Oppo F3 is now best selfie smartphone in its range. There are some niggles, like the camera occasionally takes a little time in post processing when you are taking bokeh images or when switching between various filters, but these things are not really deal breakers. Primary camera: Good, not great at the back, the Oppo F3 uses a tried and tested 13MP sensor, which takes good pictures for the most part. I observed decent colour reproduction and dynamic range, but softer photos that seem to be produced by the same algorithm as the selfies. In the case of the rear camera, its more of an issue though.
Battery
The 3200mAh battery on the phone can keep up with even the heaviest users and would last a normal work day easily, with at max 30 minutes of gaming. If you are not into gaming or dont use navigation that often, the phone will definitely last you more than 12-15 hours in a day. Once you put it on charge, the phone gets fully charged under two hours and does not support any kind of fast charging, including Oppos own VOOC charging technology. It seems VOOC is another feature the company is reserving for its flagship devices.
Bottomline: For selfies only
To sum it all, the Oppo F3 takes the best selfies of any phone under Rs. 40,000. However, its not a very good overall performer.

Parliament disrupted by JO on foreign instigation: Dayasiri
	
The sabotaging acts staged by the members of the Joint Opposition in Parliament last Friday (28) with the intention to preventing the passing of the Hambantota Port Development Project (HPDP) Agreement, had been instigated by a diplomatic mission of a powerful country, Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera said today.
Addressing the weekly Cabinet news briefing yesterday, Minister Jayasekera said the opposition members had no intention to disrupt the Parliamentary proceedings, when the agreement scheduled to be signed between the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) and the China Merchant Ports Holding Co. (CMPH) was taken up for debate on Friday.
There was a call from a diplomatic mission in Colombo to the JO during the proceedings. Only after this call, the JO decided to disrupt the proceedings and members of the JO rushed to the well of the House shouting and blocking Government members addressing the House, Minister Jayasekera said.
Journalists started fielding questions at this stage and Minister Jayasekera, who is also a joint Cabinet Spokesman, replied.
Journalist: The Cabinet has decided to introduce further amendments to the framework agreement of the HPDA Port. Why
Minister Jayasekera: That is the difference between this Government and others. President Maithripala Sirisena does not want to do without the knowledge of the people. It was President Sirisena who said the agreement was open for further amendments and then to present it in Parliament.
Journalist: Why a week has been given to Ministers review the agreement
Minister Jayasekera: President Sirisena thinks there is still space for the new ideas and suggestions. The Cabinet Ministers have been given a week to study the agreement. Only then it will be presented in Parliament for approval.
Journalist: Is the government ready to accommodate amendments proposed during the Parliamentary debate
Minister Jayasekera: Yes, indeed. If there were any worthwhile and valuable suggestions, that are beneficial to the country, why not
Journalist; Will the Chinese agree to new amendments
Minister Jayasekera: All changes and amendments will be brought on mutual consent.
Journalist: Does that mean the agreement will have to be signed once again
Minister Jayasekera: I dont think so.
Journalist; Then why all these redoing and revisiting of the agreement
Minister Jayasekera: The objective of further review is to ensure extreme transparency. No Government has ever presented an agreement of this nature to Parliament and all have been done in a hush-hush manner. That is why the Government has given another opportunity to the Joint Opposition to review the agreement and propose suggestions if they have any. The Government will incorporate if any valuable proposal comes from the JO. We have nothing to hide because this agreement is extremely beneficial to Sri Lanka. I believe the JO members will use this opportunity to air their views in a democratic and gentlemanly manner.
Journalist: What action the Government would take on the disruption in Parliament last Friday
Minister Jayasekera: Party leaders will decide on that issue before the next session of Parliament. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Peoples Leasing & Finance posts Rs.796mn profit for 1Q
	
The countrys largest finance company, Peoples Leasing & Finance PLC (PLC) posted a Rs.796 million net profit for the 1st quarter of 2018, down 25.9 percent compared to the same quarter last year, as the firm continued to feel the sustained monetary policy tightening by the Central Bank over the past 18 months.
Earnings per share were Rs. 0.54, down from Rs. 0.70 year-on-year (YoY). At end of trading on Friday, PLC shares were trading at Rs. 17.10, down 1.16 percent compared to the start of trading.
Group-level interest income for the quarter increased 29.3 percent YoY to Rs. 6.45 billion, while interest expenses increased 46.3 percent YoY to Rs. 3.54 billion, approximately 90 percent of both of which were from the finance and leasing operations.
PLCs bank borrowings, which had increased at a faster pace than the larger customer deposits over the past several years, put pressure on interest expenses during this quarter. Finance companies have a large portfolio of fixed interest products, which cause interest income to lag behind expenses during monetary policy tightening.
The firm, which also owns Peoples Insurance PLC, saw Rs. 953 million in net earned premium being contributed by its insurance subsidiary, up 11.2 percent YoY.
Impairment charges for loans and receivables were recorded at Rs. 549 million, up sharply from an impairment reversal of Rs. 1 million.
Profit before income tax was down 26 percent YoY to Rs. 1.15 billion.
The group asset base improved 0.4 percent to Rs. 157.97 billion, with loans and receivables 0.4 percent to Rs. 134.91 billion compared to March 31, 2017.
In PLCs liabilities front, attempts at lowering interest costs saw borrowings from banks falling 6.3 percent, while dues to customers increased 7.8 percent compared to the previous quarter. Net assets per share increased to Rs. 16.37 from Rs. 16.36 in the same period.
Operating income from the leasing and hire-purchase business for the 1st quarter fell to Rs. 648 million from Rs. 921 million YoY. Interest income from the the segment increased to Rs. 3.47 billion from Rs. 3 billion YoY.
Operating income from loans fell to Rs. 442 million from Rs. 471 million YoY, while interest income increased to Rs. 2.37 billion from Rs. 1.53 billion YoY.
The insurance business operating profits fell to Rs. 212 million from Rs. 292 million YoY.
The government owns over 84.5 percent of shares in PLC through various state financial institutions and two retirement funds. Neon Liberty Lorikeet Master Fund LP owns 4.39 percent of shares in PLC.

## Title: Police brutality is no joke,  Mr. President

Police brutality is no joke,  Mr. President
	

(c) 2017, The Washington Post 
Of all the irresponsible things that President Donald Trump has said - and there have been far too many - perhaps nothing threatens to do greater damage than his remarks encouraging police to use excessive force. That was demonstrated by the swift public condemnations of his comments from police officials, who understand better than anyone that public safety is not well served if police are seen to be above the law and distrusted. 
Please dont be too nice was Trumps admonition, to a gathering of law enforcement officials, about arresting and transporting suspects. When you guys, he said Friday at an event on Long Island, put somebody in the car and youre protecting their head, you know, the way you put their hand over Like, dont hit their head, and theyve just killed somebody - dont hit their head. I said, you can take the hand away, OK As alarming as his comments were, even more jarring was the spectacle of officers in uniform cheering and applauding. Do they need a reminder of 25-year-old Freddie Gray and how he died from a spinal injury after transport in a Baltimore police van in 2015 
It was heartening, though, to see police officials from across the country distance themselves from - with many firmly denouncing - the presidents comments giving a seeming wink and nod to police brutality. New Yorks Suffolk County Police Department, which had officers present at the Friday event, said it has strict rules and procedures that dont tolerate the roughing up of prisoners. 
New Orleans Police Superintendent Michael Harrison said unreasonable or unnecessary use of force erodes trust at a time when we need support from our local communities the most. 
Montgomery County Police Chief J. Thomas Manger was, as he bluntly writes on this page, appalled to hear such comments from the president of the United States. 
Unfortunately and to its discredit, the national union representing police rank and file attempted to give Trump a pass for his unacceptable remarks. Off the cuff comments . . . are sometimes taken all too literally by the media and professional police critics, said a statement from National Fraternal Order of Police President Chuck Canterbury. His cavalier attitude disserves his unions members, most of whom conscientiously follow the law while performing their difficult and dangerous duty. 
Given that the Justice Department under Attorney General Jeff Sessions has signaled its lack of interest in bringing needed reform to troubled police departments, in the name of law and order, it is hard not to be concerned by the presidents comments. And even if Trump really didnt mean what he said - the all-too-convenient excuse used by his apologists - we agree with former D.C. and Philadelphia police chief Charles Ramsey (hardly a professional police critic) that words matter. Trumps paean to gratuitous use of force sends the wrong message to police and to the communities they serve.

Political appointee harassing subordinates
	
A certain character who has secured the post of Commissioner General of a key state establishment through political influence has begun victimizing subordinates whom he dislikes, they say.
This upstart who is yet to be confirmed in his post is said to be harassing all employees whom he considers disloyal to him by unnecessarily pulling them up, transferring them from one division to another and subjecting them to various other forms of inconvenience.
On representations made by some victimized employees, a high political authority had recently ordered this high-up to cancel some transfers made for no rhyme or reason.

Pomposity of a politicos father
	

The father of a purohita from a coconut growing area was on his way to the nearby town when he drew up his vehicle on seeing a roadside durian seller.

He popped his head out and called out: Boy, bring me two good durian fruits!
Mahattaya, come and pick two good fruits yourself! replied the young seller.
Why cant you bring two fruits Do you know who I am
I dont know who you are, Mahattaya! I dont care who you are either! If you want durian, pick two fruits yourself! What I pick for you may not suit you!
Highly provoked by this negative reply, the purohitas father phones up the Police, a Police jeep arrives on the scene in a few minutes and two Policemen getting out force the protesting durian seller into the jeep which immediately speeds away as several bystanders look on shocked and amazed.
The news about the arrest of the young durian seller soon spread like wildfire and a highly concerned son of the purohita on hearing about the incident rushed to the Police station and got the poor durian seller released, they say.

President gifts kastane to National Museum
	
President Maithripala Sirisena presented the invaluable artifact, Kastane, he received from Russian President Vladimir Putin to the National Museum today.
He received the royal sword (Kastane) of the Kandyan era of the 19th century from President Putin during his state visit to Russia in March this year.
President Putin, a known lover of antique weapons, graciously decided to part with one of his treasured antiques for the sake of friendship, the Presidents Media Division said.
It was a pleasant surprise for President Sirisena as the Russian leader gave this invaluable gift when he entered the Green Chimney Room in the Kremlin at the Red Square for bilateral talks with President Putin. The Russian leader said he was presenting this significant gift to President Sirisena symbolizing the close relationship between the two countries, it said.
When President Sirisena was admiring the shining weapon and its beautifully carved case which was studded with gems, Putin explained that it was an antique Kastane belonging to a Kandyan Nilame (Nobleman) and that it has a fascinating history.
This sword had been brought to England in 1906 and later bought by Russia at the leading archeological artifact auction house, Sothebys in London.
The Kastane (sword, hanger) was the major attribute of the noblemen of Sri Lanka. People who were not noble by origin were not eligible to bear or even keep a Kastane.
Therefore, the purpose of such arm was to underline the stature of the bearer. According to Alex Freger (Tel Aviv), a high-profile Israeli expert on bladed weapons, the item subject to expertise descends from the Kandyan rulers (kings).
Freger noted that the Kandy ruling class had always played an essential political and religious role in Sri Lanka. The temple which still keeps custody over the sacred Buddhist object  Tooth of Buddha  was located at the premises of the Royal Palace, and up to this day is the destination of pilgrims from all over the world.
The Kastane was auctioned at the Sothebys Auction House on 19 December 2006 in the elite section of Property of a Princely Family and Other Aristocratic Estates.

The United National Party (UNP) is likely to take a decision on Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake based on his response to the allegations made against him at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI), informed sources said yesterday.
A large number of UNP MPs have sought a meeting with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is reported to have said the party should wait till Mr. Karunanayake makes his statement at the PCoI today.
Sources said these MPs were of the view that the party should not support the minister, but were agreeable to the Premier's suggestion.
One of these MPs said it was not fair to take action only against Mr. Karunanayake because several other ministers and MPs from both parties had associated with Perpetual Treasuries Ltd Chairman Arjun Aloysius in the recent past.
Mr. Aloysius has acted as facilitator for several other ministers and MPs with regard to business deals. Those who are over reacting on the CB bond issue are the ones who have had dealings with him, he said. (Yohan Perera)

Reinventing creative architectural craft in Sri Lanka
	
The project that acquired the Geoffrey Bawa Award 2016/2017 for Excellence in Architecture for Architect Thisara Thanapathy
The Geoffrey Bawa Awards for Excellence in Architecture strives to recognize architecture in Sri Lanka
Geoffrey Bawa was recognised as having been among the greatest Asian architects of the second half of the Twentieth Century. He was also one of the most significant Sri Lankans of his time. He was Sri Lankas most influential and prolific architect and South Asias leading guru of tropical architecture, also known as tropical modernism. Within a span of about 50 years, he created a wide range of architectural works, mostly in southwest Sri Lanka, which established a prototype for buildings in newly independent Sri Lanka. 
Since his demise, the Geoffrey Bawa Trust has organised The Geoffrey Bawa Awards for Excellence in Architecture to celebrate the life and work of the renowned architect whose name they carry and strive to stimulate. The trust believes the event will help reinvent creative architectural craft and fine-tune the creative skill of the countrys architects. 
This years awards ceremony saw an all new catergorisation of awards, in response to the fact that many assumptions were made about contemporary Sri Lankan architecture; now in a stage of flux
Architect Thisara Thanapathy was adjudged as the winner of the prestigious Geoffrey Bawa Awards 2016/2017 for Excellence in Architecture, for his creative design of the Spa at Santani, Kandy. It was the second time he has won the prestigious award. Previously he received this award in 2011 for his design of the Sarath Abeyrathne House. 
He was also adjudged as the winner of the Leisure and Entertainment Category at the awards which just concluded. The spa and wellness centre uses a minimal material palette and has a minimalist approach to making simple rectilinear spaces to achieve a certain architectural silence. In his own words, Santani is a spa and wellness centre that attempts to play a role in the facilitation of silence in the landscape while providing the services of a spa. Silence is seen here as the antidote to our hyper connected and noisy world. This is achieved by making a building that almost entirely disappears into the landscape as a series of stone terraces planted with grass, said Thanapathy.
The Lifetime Award went toProf. David Robson who was recognized for the singular honour of having contributed consistently through his work towards the greater appreciation of architecture. He was presented with the Geoffrey Bawa Award for Lifetime Contribution to Architecture by Geoffrey Bawa Trustee Suhanya Raffel. Among Prof. David Robsons outstanding achievements in Sri Lanka were the planning of the Hundred Thousand Houses Programme and the master-plan of the Rampokunagama New Town. 
Tokens of appreciation were presented to the team involved in dismantling, moving, reconstruction and conservation of the Ena de Silva house at Lunuganga, a first of its kind project in Sri Lanka. Architect Amila de Mel, Engineer Deepal Wickremasinghe, Quantity Surveyor Joe Fernando and Architect and Archaeologist Nilan Cooray received these awards. 
Australian artistic photographer, painter and sculptor, Fiona Hall being the Guest Speaker of the ceremony, delivered the keynote address. Distinguished Singaporean architect Mok Wei Wei made the judges address at the ceremony. 
This years awards ceremony saw an all new catergorisation of awards, in response to the fact that many assumptions were made about contemporary Sri Lankan architecture; now in a stage of flux. 
Explaining the rationale behind this move, the judges said, We asked if it was possible, or indeed fair, to compare a hotel with a training centre or a car maintenance facility in terms of their respective architectural briefs, functionality, form and of course budgets. Our decision to introduce categories recognizes architectural projects that might not otherwise make it to a shortlist, which in turn allowed for comparisons to be made on more equitable terms without compromising on a standard of excellence.  
The five categories of awards are: Residential; Commercial; Institutional; Industrial, Transport and infrastructure; and Leisure and entertainment. 
The list of category winners at the Geoffrey Bawa Awards 2016/2017 are: Residential - (best of category) - Studio Dwelling, Rajagiriya (2015), Architect Palinda Kannangara, (honourable mention) - Olu Beach Villa, Ambalangoda (2013), Michael Danne Bolier; Commercial - (best of category) - Citizens Development Business Finance PLC Bank and Corporate Office, Colombo 10 (2015), Architect Shayan Kumaradas; Institutional - (best of category) Kaithady District Vocational Training Centre, Jaffna (2015), Architect Chinthaka Wickramage and Nileeka Senerath, (honourable mention) Auditorium and Accommodation Chinmaya Mission, Ramboda (2014), Architect Yudish Ganesen; Industrial, transport and infrastructure - (best of category) Sterling Aftercare Centre, Galle (2016), by Architect Thushara Waidyasekera; Leisure and entertainment - (best of category) Spa at Santani, Kandy (2015), Architect Thisara Thanapathy. 
In the build up to the awards ceremony, the judges visited all the shortlisted projects alongside a technical team and made deliberations in January by visiting a total of 15 projects out of 65 submissions received out of which 11 were shortlisted
In the build up to the awards ceremony, the judges visited all the shortlisted projects alongside a technical team and made deliberations in January by visiting a total of 15 projects out of 65 submissions received out of which 11 were shortlisted. 
The panel of judges further noted, What connects the 11 shortlisted projects isnt easy to classify, but if they have anything in common it would be that they all question, in one way or another, what we come to expect when we think of contemporary architecture in the country. 
Our final shortlist was made on the basis of recognizing that architecture in Sri Lanka is changing with the times and bringing with it new clients and social and welfare agendas, along with questions of sustainable or green architecture. We believe these changes need to be recognized, and the Geoffrey Bawa Award for Excellence in Architecture makes this possible, they further stated. 
Another significant occurrence at this years awards ceremony was that two unexpected projects were shortlisted for the first time; one by a non-architect who is Sri Lankan and the other by a Dutch architect. This suggests that Sri Lankan architecture has attained a level of maturity in design that has opened doors to the participation of non-professional Sri Lankans and overseas contenders. 
The shortlisted projects in the order of submissions: Samadhi Nature Resort, Narampanawa, (2014),
W.C. Jayasinghe; Citizens Development Business Finance PLC Bank and Corporate Office, Colombo 10 (2015), Architect Shayan Kumaradas; Olu Beach Villa, Ambalangoda (2013), Michael Danne Bolier (Architect from the Netherlands); Auditorium and Accommodation Chinmaya Mission, Ramboda (2014), Architect Yudish Ganesen; Mihila Green Factory, Agalawatte (2008), Architect Tilak Samarawickrama; The Urban Haven- Renovation and Addition to Carlton Pre-School, Colombo 10 (2014), Architect Ranga Dayasena; Sterling Aftercare Centre, Galle (2016), Architect Thusara Waidyasekera; Studio Dwelling, Rajagiriya (2015), Architect Palinda Kannangara; Family Retreat, Malabe (2014), Architect Palinda Kannangara; Spa at Santani, Kandy (2015), Architect Thisara Thanapathy; and Kaithady District Vocational Training Centre, Jaffna (2015), Architect Chinthaka Wickramage and Nileeka Senerath. 
The judging panel for the 2016/2017 cycle comprised distinguished Singaporean architect Mok Wei Wei, Geoffrey Bawa Trust representative Ward Beling, Sri Lanka Institute of Architects President elect D. H. Wijewardene and Raking Leaves and Sri Lanka Archives for Art, Architecture and Design and Jaffna Founder/Director Sharmini Pereira (Considered to be an informed lay person)

Scaramucci  fired  as Communications Director
	

By Abby Phillip,
John Wagner and Damian Paletta 
The Washington Post, July 31, 2017 - 
President Trump fired communications director Anthony Scaramucci on Monday at the urging of new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly, a clear sign that the retired Marine general is being empowered to manage what has been an unwieldy West Wing operation. 
Kelly demanded Scaramuccis departure after he attacked former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus in a profanity-laced interview last week that quickly became a public symbol of the vicious infighting that has helped define the first months of the administration. 
Trumps willingness to dismiss Scaramucci whom he hired just 10 days ago was viewed by many in the West Wing as an indication that he is eager to impose order and is giving Kelly the tools to do so. 
General Kelly has the full authority to operate within the White House, and all staff will report to him, said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. 
Left unclear is whether Kelly will be able to curb the presidents inclination to subvert pecking orders, his tendency to encourage rivalries among his staff and his insistence on managing his own message through social media in ways that have often undermined his aides strategic planning. 
But Kellys arrival signals that Trump is putting his confidence in someone he perceives to have the stature and experience to be a forceful leader in a White House characterized by competing power centres. 
After swearing in Kelly to his role during an Oval Office ceremony, Trump treated him to the formalities typically reserved for visiting heads of state. As the two sat shoulder to shoulder in armchairs for the benefit of cameras, Trump leaned in and effusively praised Kelly, who previously served as Trumps homeland security secretary. He later lavished more praise on him during a Cabinet meeting. 

Priebus was viewed inside the White House as being ineffective and having little control over other top aides, and the president had mused for months about replacing him. In one of the strongest indications that Kelly will have greater authority than his predecessor, Trumps daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner  both of whom advocated for Kelly to be hired  have expressed their willingness to support any structural changes Kelly might make, according to a White House official. Sanders confirmed that they, too, will report to Kelly, as will all other officials.

Seylan Bank June net up 25% but asset quality weakens
	
Seylan Bank PLC reported earnings of Rs.3.74 a share or Rs.1.32 billion for the June quarter (2Q17), recording an increase of 25 percent year-on-year (YoY) amid weaker growth in loans, compressed margins and higher loan loss provisions, the interim results of the bank showed.
The bank with an asset base of Rs.370 billion managed to grow its loans by about Rs.7.7 billion during the 6 months while the deposits grew by some Rs.6.7 billion, relatively weaker for a bank of its size.
The bank on a standalone basis has a loan book of little under Rs.250 billion and a deposit base of Rs.280.2 billion.
The banks net interest income rose by 15 percent YoY to Rs.3.67 billion but the interest expenses rose much faster than the increase in interest income, exerting pressure on the margins.
As a result, the net interest margin fell by 21 basis points to 3.98 percent.
The low cost deposits measured by current and savings account (CASA) ratio also fell by about 100 basis points to 31.6 percent during the six months ended June 30, 2017.
Meanwhile, the bank made higher provisions against some selected clients as the specific provisions rose to Rs. 684.8 million from Rs.103.8 million YoY.
Seylan said these were some impairments made on, legacy NPAs that was made due to the delay experienced in settlement of dues by the Compensation Tribunal and another payment to be received  as a secured creditor with the liquidation of entity concerned.
The soar loan portfolio also rose as the gross non-performing loan ratio increased to 5.16 percent from 4.47 percent in December 2016.
The net fee and commission income rose by 23 percent YoY to Rs.903.1 million for the quarter. 
Meanwhile, for the six months ended on June 30, 2017, the banking group reported earnings of Rs.6.13 per share or Rs.2.14 billion net profit, recording an increase of little under 24 percent YoY. The net interest income for the period was Rs.7.29 billion, up 18 percent YoY.

Both specific and general provisions rose substantially.
The banks tier I and tier II capital adequacy ratios stood at 10.42 percent and 12.67 percent, higher than the regulatory minimums but a higher growth in assets could weaken the capitalization.
As of June 30, the government held little over 32 percent stake in Seylan Bank PLC through Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Limited, Employees Provident Fund and Bank of Ceylon.
Brown & Company PLC and LOLC Investments Limited held 13.97 percent and 9.55 percent stakes, respectively.

Stage set for SL to be a debt free State: PM
	
The stage has been set for Sri Lanka to become a debt free nation, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
The premier made this statement during the opening of the new swimming pool at Prince of Wales College Moratuwa last evening.
Country may have borrowed funds for good things and bad things but borrowings came during the present generation. Therefore, it is the present generation which should settle them. We should not leave the burden of debt to others. Parents never allow their children to inherit their debts. They settle their debts and secure a future for their children. We are trying to do the same and has paved the way for it, the Prime Minister said.
We have to utilize almost whole of its revenue to settle the debts. Taxes have to be increased to generate funds to settle debts. Revenue of individuals decline when taxes are increased. Therefore this government initially focused on paying off the debts, he said.
The Premier said the government will start off paying its debts by the year 2020 and to ease the debt burden by 2025. It is also essential to provide employment opportunities, bring in new technologies. There are several projects lined up for the future generations. One must get the full use of these development projects. Country will go through a vast industrialization process. Sri Lanka currently depends on the export of few items such as apparels and tyres. This has to be expanded and the country should go for more manufacturing industries such as electronic goods and must expand the software industry, he said.
We are going in for a new society. A society based on information technology and new things such as electric vehicles, tourism will also expand. We have to be ready for this modernization. One should learn new languages such as Chinese and German. Learning these languages is certainly going to help. A government should secure a future for the youth and to the new generations and the national government is ready to do it. The intention of the government is to create a secured future for the people of this country so that they can be successful citizens of a modern Sri Lanka, he added. (Yohan Perera)

The blood sucking pests behind your itchy scalp
	

Head Lice. The worst nightmare to any person with thick long hair. Although they may not be life threatening, head lice are one of the many nuisances one must endure as a child. This is also one of the challenges one must overcome as a parent. Many a school faces problems associated with the spread of head lice. The cause for this is children stuck together in one place. However, its not only little children who have their heads crawling with these pests. If you were to travel in a packed bus or train there is a high chance you will be able to spot more than a few lice making their way up strands of hair heading towards their final destination, the scalp. Consultant Dermatologist Dr. Nayani Madarasinghe in an interview with the Health Capsule spoke at length about this topic and highlighted many facts regarding this blood sucking, common place pest which people need to get rid of. 
Dr. Madarasinghe explained that a head lice is a small insect who will cling on to human scalp. A female lice will usually live for about a 40 days period and then it will lay eggs and the eggs will hatch in about 7 to 10 days. The eggs, which are what we call nits, are usually closely attached to the hair. They are usually found clinging on to the first centimetre of hair strand, located close to the scalp. After the eggs hatch, the premature head lice will be released. The head lice can live only on the human scalp. Once its left in the environment, usually it cant survive,she said. 


Maintain proper hygiene
Speaking about how the lice can spread, she added, They usually get it from head to head contact. Anyone can get it, but its more common among children and people who arent maintaining proper hygienic practices. When people use the same pillow, combs and towels they can contract lice and it can spread. 
Dr. Madarasinghe further stated that the most common symptoms of head lice is the itching. This is a reaction of the skin caused due to the fact that the head lice are living on the scalp. The head lice will suck blood from the scalp and will deposit excretions such as urine and faeces on the scalp. Its this which causes the symptom of itching. However you can even have head lice without feeling the itch. Another way you can find out if you have them is their visibility. At any given time you can identify head lice, whether its a mature one, an immature one or even a nit, she elaborated.  
Furthermore, she said that although they arent dangerous, complications can occur if no treatment is taken to get rid of them. When people dont treat it, there can be some bacterial infections that can set in. This can give rise to crusting, oozing and then the neck glands can become enlarged,she warned.

Treatment through lotions
Speaking about treatment that can get rid of lice in the long run, Dr. Madarasinghe said, There are several lotions which can be applied, which can be bought over the counter from pharmacies. When you are applying a lotion you have to apply it on the dry hair and it has to cover the scalp from the root of the hair to the tip. And you will have to leave it on for a period of time. This will differ according to the product that is being used, so you must check and follow the instructions properly.
Usually you have to repeat this after one week because new ones will be on the scalp, from the nits which would have hatched afterwards. So then the second application is usually necessary. Another thing that can be done is wet combing. Other measures that should be followed are frequent bathing, using one towel for yourself and having your own personal things (such as a personal comb). Its also important that everybody- if they are in close contact-should be treated together. 
Dr. Madarasinghe further advised parents to inspect their childrens hair from an early age in order to prevent the spread of lice.

The road to a new Cold War
	

(c) 2017,
The Washington Post  
The United States and Russia have descended to a new low point in relations, with waves of sanctions and escalating retaliation. Twenty-five years after the Cold War ended, relations are back in a deep freeze. What happened 
The current tension did not come about because the United States suddenly wanted its old adversary back. What happened is a response to bad choices taken by President Vladimir Putin of Russia. These choices were made deliberately in Moscow, perhaps for Putins own reasons of domestic politics and foreign policy. They are the main reason for the tension that now exists. 
Putin chose to seize Crimea from Ukraine, annex it and then instigate an armed insurrection in southeastern Ukraine in 2014, violating all post-World War II norms of national sovereignty. The war in the Donbasregion was a tactic by Putin to inject further instability into Ukraine after Ukraines president, Putin ally Viktor Yanukovych, fled his palace in the face of mass protest. Putin was aggrieved at Ukraines decision to sign a pact with the European Union, but Ukraine is not a vassal of Russia, and Putins claims to a sphere of influence are untenable. The sanctions imposed by the United States and Europe were a response to Putins ill-considered impulse to use violence as a tool of intimidation and coercion. 
Another poor and deliberate choice was to interfere with the U.S. election campaign. Putin cannot escape responsibility for Russian attempts to damage the candidacy of former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and, perhaps, tilt the election to Donald Trump. We know that Putin seethed over Clintons outspoken support for the principle of free speech during the 2011-2013 protests against him, but he is altogether wrong to think the United States engineered the unrest. Putin and his aides cynically deny they attempted to interfere in the U.S. election, but surely they know exactly what occurred and how. The sanctions imposed by President Barack Obama last December and recently tightened by Congress did not appear out of thin air. They are a logical response to Putins attempt to meddle in American democracy. 
Have these choices had positive consequences for Russia or global stability Putin behaves as though he believes Russia is walking tall. Perhaps in his zero-sum world, he takes satisfaction in the chaos rippling through U.S. politics, but his tactics have backfired badly in both Ukraine and the United States. And Putins choices have been costly for Russia, its economy and its people. 
We have long believed that U.S.-Russian engagement is essential to avert miscalculation, and it remains important for both Washington and Moscow to keep talking. But Putin should not expect the West to suddenly forgive or forget his bad choices. He would be wiser to deal with the underlying source of tension than to sit around plotting new ways to escalate it.

## Title: The silent enemy of kidney disease

The silent enemy of kidney disease
	

Diabetes Mellitus is an illness triggered by lack of insulin in the body or the bodys inability to use normal quantities of insulin, in accurate levels. 
There are two major types of the disease known as Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1, also known as Juvenile onset Diabetes Mellitus or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, is known to be prevalent in higher incidences among children.
In this type of Diabetes, your pancreas doesnt produce sufficient amounts of Insulin and therefore you will have to depend on life-long Insulin injections to maintain the optimal levels in the body.

Type 2 diabetes, also known as Adult onset Diabetes Mellitus, is the commonest one and usually affects people over 40. Its also called non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus where your pancreas makes insulin, but the body fails in making use of it properly due to certain pathological defects in the uptake or metabolism. The high blood sugar level which would be the end result, can often be controlled by life style alterations and medication even though some patients might need Insulin. Unfortunately, the incidences of this type 2 diabetes are rapidly increasing among the population of Sri Lanka, possibly due to lack of awareness and various misbeliefs. 


QHow do kidneys get affected by increased sugar levels in the blood
This is a common question asked by most of our patients with Diabetes. To discuss on it, we thought of having our todays Q & A session with Sri Jayewardenepura General Hospital Registrar in Internal Medicine Dr. Solith Senanayake. 
Insulin, manufactured by the pancreas, regulates the concentration of glucose in the blood. When the body lacks insulin, this will haphazardly result in high blood sugar levels, eventually, resulting in several unhealthy disease conditions in body organs, especially your kidneys, nerves and eyes. Kidneys play a vital role in your body so, its important to protect your kidneys from harmful consequences caused by Diabetes, explained Dr. Senanayake. 
You might have heard about some diabetic patients who have become dialysis dependent with a poor quality of life and endless suffering, so that is surely not where you want to end up if you are a diabetic, he affirmed. 
The major function of kidneys in the body is to eliminate waste matter from the blood and return purified blood back to the body, thus maintaining the electrolyte imbalance. Diabetic nephropathy is one of the commonest complications of long term diabetes which can be prevented properly by following medical advice effectively. 

Diabetes is the commonest cause of kidney disease where even if the condition is controlled, already initiated pathology can result in chronic kidney disease and kidney failure said Dr. Senanayake. But good control will always delay the progression of kidney disease. 
According to the latest data, 20-30% of people with diabetes are susceptible to kidney disease, even though, not all of them would develop in to aforementioned renal failure. Furthermore, its important to keep in mind that a person with diabetes is vulnerable to nephropathy regardless of the fact that they use insulin or not, he further stated. Also, the incidence is high in patients who are having diabetes over a long period of time with other co-morbidities. 

QHow does the process take place
When your blood sugar levels are kept high for a long time, there will be 3 major changes taking place in the kidneys. 
1. Increased production and uncontrolled Glycation of matrix proteins resulting in a rapid Mesangial expansion (augmentation of the extracellular matrix) 
2. Thickening of the glomerular membrane 
3. Intra-glomerular hypertension due to dilatation or ischaemic injury to the affected renal artery injury (due to hyaline thickening), causing glomerular sclerosis 
In simpler terms, all these changes will alter the normal structure of your kidneys, thus resulting in a failure to maintain their optimal function. 


QHow do you usually diagnose patients with Diabetic nephropathy
Dont wait for the signs and symptoms to develop. The normal kidneys can function even with a 25% of its functioning capacity even without revealing any signs. Therefore, by the time you notice changes, more than 75% your kidneys would be non-functional, Dr. Senanayake said. 

QWhat are the symptoms of an affected patient 
Passing frothy urine 
	Ankle swelling 
	Generalized swelling of body parts 
	Sleep disturbances 
	Loss of appetite and loss of weight 
	Digestive tract disturbances 
	Poor concentration & sometimes coma 
Q How do you usually proceed with a patient suspected to be having the above features 
After taking a thorough history about, 
Your condition 
	Its control 
	Medication you are on 
	Routine test reports, we will direct the suspected patients to get these essential tests done to test the glucose levels in the blood. This check up helps determine whether the kidney has been affected as a result of uncontrolled Diabetes. 
	Urine Test- help check the presence of Micro-albumin (earliest way of detecting) 
	Renal Function Test- help check the notch of kidney function. 

QIs there any treatment available for the disease
Unfortunately, there is no permanent cure for Diabetic Nephropathy even though Kidney transplantation, which is costly, can be used to save lives of patients in the End stage of renal disease. Its also important to note that these various types of treatment used recklessly can become more antagonizing since there is a chance of a possible weakening of kidneys then leading to renal failure. 
Therefore its important to remember that prevention, marks the most helpful method of therapy with a proper control of blood glucose levels and blood pressure. 

Other available treatment
 Dialysis or non-natural kidney treatment 
This is usually to prevent patients reaching, End-stage kidney failure where your kidneys cease to function. This advanced mechanism known as Dialysis contains the filtration of patients blood over a distinctive machine which will eliminate waste materials over time while stabilizing water and electrolyte levels. 
 Kidney transplantation 
A kidney obtained from a compatible donor can be transplanted. This is indicated in a special category of patients including young children and patients without any significant co-morbidities etc. But, the problem in our country is that this treatment isnt readily available for patients apart from being quite expensive.
Myth breaker
Before concluding the interview, we asked Dr. Senanayake about some common ideas expressed regarding Diabetes related kidney disease, people tend to believe at present. 
Using long term drugs like Metformin can cause kidney disease 
	My FBS is good so my diabetic control is good
	My BP is normal every time I check, so I dont take drugs regularly 
	Insulin causes kidney damage, so I prefer drugs 
	Even though my sugar control isnt optimal I feel just fine 
According to him, the beliefs are complete misconceptions and if you are one of these individuals who have doubts about any of them, its always better to seek the opinion of a qualified health care professional rather than relying on the opinion of people who are not professionals in the medical field.

They want to cut him down to size!
	

The young talkative Betel leaf Diyawanna member from Polonnaruwa recently threw a tantrum over some injustice done to him by the JO and announced that he was withdrawing himself from all political activities of the group.

He charged that the JO had organized several party meetings in the Polonnaruwa district without his knowledge and pointed the finger of accusation at the former strongmans political strategist- brother, the livewire behind the Pohottuwa political party- the political front of the JO group.
But the informed ones say that the real reason for the young JO activist to rail against the JO was the action taken by the Pohottuwa strategist to appoint several organizers for the Polonnaruwa district without informing or consulting him.
Several JO stalwarts had blamed the political sibling of the former strongman for the injustice done to the young Diyawanna member. Meanwhile, a JO heavyweight from the Kandy area, highly critical of the arbitrary action taken by the political sibling had proposed to his colleagues in the group that they should lose no time in entrusting all powers relating to running the group and the groups front party to the former strongman himself in order to put the ambitious sibling in his proper place, they say.

Trump silent on Russia after Putin announced expulsion of US diplomats
	

By Karen Deyoung  
(c) 2017, The Washington Post 
Aug 01, 2017 - 
President Donald Trump said nothing Monday in response to Russias planned expulsion of hundreds of American diplomats, announced over the weekend by President Vladimir Putin. 
Right now were reviewing our options, and when we have something to say on it well let you know, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday after Trumps silence continued through several public appearances. 
Asked when Trump would sign the bill passed last week by Congress, levying new sanctions on Russia, that precipitated the Kremlins move, Sanders said that well let you know when thats going to happen. 
Whatever Trump decides to do in response, the fast-moving series of events appeared to leave the administration with no substantive Russia policy and without a clear idea of what direction to take. 
It was left to Vice President Mike Pence, on a visit to NATO member Estonia, to note obliquely that we hope for . . . better relations with Russia, but that recent diplomatic action by Moscow will not deter U.S. defence of its Baltic allies against Russian aggression. 
Putin said in a Moscow television interview late Sunday that he expected U.S.-Russia relations to worsen and that Russia may come up with other forms of sanctions retaliation. 
Just as Trump did not mention Russia on Monday, Putins spokesman indicated that Trump was irrelevant to the Kremlins decision to retaliate before the new sanctions bill took effect. Passed with massive majorities in the House and Senate, it will de facto become a law even if the U.S. president does not sign it, spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow. So there was no need to wait, he said. Things are pretty obvious. 
While Russia remained interested in improvements -promised by Trump during his campaign- relations for now were far from this ideal, Peskov said. 
Putin waited a half year to respond to a decision by President Barack Obama, in the waning days of his administration, to sanction Russia with diplomatic expulsions and property seizures in retaliation for cyber-intrusions in the U.S. electoral campaign. Trump has repeatedly expressed doubts about Moscows culpability, and the Russians were clearly expecting a change in policy. 
Russia had demanded the return of two diplomatic compounds in this country, labeled intelligence outposts by Obama, and applied for visas to send replacements for the 35 diplomats the previous administration kicked out. 
But not only was no progress made on either issue, Trumps inability to stop the new sanctions legislation apparently led Putin to recalculate.

The Russian government, I think, has largely written off Trump as a person who can deliver, said Andrew Weiss, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a Russia policy official during the Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush administrations. 
But by the same token, they think theres no benefit in truly antagonizing him, and so theyll jolly him along for the indefinite future, Weiss said.

Wanted funds, but got a sermon!
	

A number of political heavyweights have already teamed up with the new political alignment that has come up from the East to topple the Tree and the one ruling its roost.

The co-founders of the new entity needing funds to build up the party had initially approached friendly businessmen but the response from them had been poor. So they had quietly met the heads of diplomatic missions from several mid-east countries based in the city to seek financial assistance from them.
The mid-east envoys after promising to consider their request had on the sly spilled the beans to the Tree party leader and the latter had convinced the envoys of the need to protect the unity of the community and a new party alignment would mean a serious split in the community.
When the co-founders of the new political entity called on the mid-east envoys recently expecting a positive response from them had a surprise coming to them when they offered them an unsolicited advice: Dont get divided. Fight for your rights as a united force!
The leading lights of the new political alignment are now looking for other sources that could help them much needed- funds, they say.

Woes of a wooer
	

The Group of 18, widely known as the G 18 has become the main topic in political circles these days.

The secretarial one closest to Number One is said to be wining and dining these dissidents regularly  two or three at a time  at his official residence these days in a relentless effort to woo them back to the fold, they say.
However, the efforts of the secretarial one have so far failed to produce any tangible result. Getting the roly-poly Muthu to straddle the fence is the only measure of success he has achieved.
It has become quite obvious that no amount of coaxing and pleading is going to change the heart of at least three stalwarts of the group: two of them are ex-secretarial ones  one from Wayamba and the other from Colombo district and the third one is a heavyweight from the gem-city. The trio have reportedly taken a politically very significant decision which they have decided to announce only after September 21, informed sources say.

27 years after the  Iraq-Kuwait war
	
A Sri Lankan who worked at the the Embassy of Sri Lanka inSaudi Arabia recalls thegruesome tale
Iraq forces invaded Kuwait on 2nd of August 1990. Then there were thousands of expatriates working in Kuwait. Reports reveal that over 10,000 Sri Lankans were engaged in various occupations in Iraq. Today marks the 27th year after the war between Iraq-Kuwait broke out. Most of the Sri Lanka expatriates came to Saudi Arabia crossing the Kuwait-Saudi border considering their safety. Most of them didnt possess any valuables when they were crossing the Saudi border. Most of expatriate workers who came to Saudi Arabia were housemaids. 
When this war occurred, I was serving at the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Saudi Arabia. Thousands of Sri Lankans came to the Embassy of Sri Lanka for their safety. I have never faced this kind of incident before while serving in the Government Service. We were confused when we saw the helpless Sri Lankans surrounding the Embassy. It was difficult to help them because the embassy had limited resources and lacked staff. The embassy had only 16 staffers then.
At that time the Ambassador of Sri Lanka was getting treatment in a hospital in Riyadh. One of the most prominent characters in Sri Lanka Foreign Service, the acting Ambassador Prasad Kariyawasam (Now the Secretary of Foreign Affairs) had to shoulder the burden. It was lucky that he had a dedicated staff to help him. He could share this burden with them. I take this opportunity to specially thank the Government of Saudi Arabia which provided shelter and flights to evacuate stranded Sri Lankans and take them back to their motherland, due to the Gulf War. 
We were confused when we saw the helpless Sri Lankans surrounding the Embassy. It was difficult to help them because the embassy had limited resources and lacked staff
It was a great solace to him (Ambassador) that Kariyawasam could take prompt action to help these stranded Sri Lankans with the help of staff of the Embassy. From the day that these stranded Sri Lankans arrived at the embassy, we didnt have any leisure time, even to have our meals. We had no proper sleep either. We had to go to the airport three-four times daily in the night to send back the Sri Lankans. Most of them didnt have a travel document (Passport). Then the acting ambassador authorized the home based officers to sign the temporary travel documents. Later these travel documents were used by the stranded Sri Lankans to obtain compensation which was paid to them by SLBFE, due to Gulf War. 
When recalling this situation, we cant forget the services rendered by the expatriate Sri Lankans working in various institutions in Riyadh and other places such as Mawarid Services Ltd and J&P Company Ltd. Transport, food items and clothes were supplied by both these companies and the Sri Lankans who were working there. 
Most of the housemaids who came said that their main aim was to work in Saudi Arabia for some time, earn money and return to Sri Lanka. They said that they had come to Kuwait by pawning their properties and they had to redeem them. The acting Ambassador and the staff of the Embassy took a decision at a staff meeting to grant permission to those who were willing to do so. And at the same time there were requests from Saudi Sponsors to get the services of house maids. Then they were asked to deposit three months salary in the Embassy in order to obtain air tickets at the end of three months service and return to Sri Lanka. Receipts were issued for these amounts by the embassy. Many Sri Lankans got this opportunity. 
In the meantime we were instructed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Colombo to send back the families of home based officers in the Embassy as the threat of Saddam Husain to Saudi Arabia loomed large. As a result we had to send back our families to Sri Lank and remain alone. We were instructed to have one room sealed in our houses. We were even supplied with gas marks, in case there was a sudden chemical attack. We felt very sorry to have faced such a situation at this time of our lives. By then Saddam Hussein had already expressed that he would attack Saudi Arabia with chemical weapons. Then we realized that not only were our lives in danger, we were also facing a struggle between life and death. 
Saddam had issued a deadline before carrying out the chemical attack on Saudi Arabia. According to my knowledge, the first missile targeting Riyadh by Iraq was scheduled for September 16. In the nigh that day, we felt a great fear as Riyadh came under a chemical missile attack. But fortunately Saddam hadnt used chemicals in keeping with the announcement made by the Saudi Government. Saddam had sent over 20 scud missiles to Saudi Arabia. Only two or three scud missiles crashed on to the land. The others were destroyed by the Patriot Missiles which were excellent productions of Americans during that era. One day a scud missile landed near the Airbase of Riyadh which was close to my house. One Pakistani person was killed during this incident. On that day a glass in a room at my house was shattered due to this attack. I feared very much on that day. 
We had to go to the airport three-four times daily in the night to send back the Sri Lankans. Most of them didnt have a travel document (Passport)
After a few days of scud missile attacks we had to get used to it and then no fear was felt. During the night we used to travel in Riyadh city without fear. One day we had to stop in front of the Al-Kosama Hotel due to the bugle sound signaling that there was a scud missile attack. Many people, including foreigners, were looking at the sky. A scud missile that was fired clashed with a patriot missile, launched from the airbase. We were watching the incident. At once the patriot missile got stuck to the scud missile and destroyed it in the sky. Only the ash on the earth. Though our lives were at risk, I was very happy to have this experience in my life as an employee in the Government Service. But it is very unfortunate to state that our service in a foreign country, at a time of war, didnt merit any commendation from the Sri Lankan Authorities. 
148 American soldiers were killed and 148 were wounded. 292 soldiers were killed in coalition. 32 aircraft crashed. 75 fighter flights were destroyed in the attack. 
57 aircraft of Kuwait were lost. 4200 were killed by Iraq and 12000 were captured. 200 Tanks were destroyed. 850 of other military vehicles were captured by Iraqi troops. 27 ships were sunk. 6 were captured. Over 1000 civilian Kuwaitees were killed. 600 were missing. Eight Sri Lankans were killed and 32 were wounded.

In Iraq as many as 20000-30000 security personnel were killed. Over 75000 soldiers were wounded. 3700 Tanks were destroyed by the allied forces. 110 aircraft were destroyed. 137 aircraft were flown to Iran. 19 ships were sunk. 6 were damaged. 3664 civilians were killed.

A Coughing Fit
	

Query: I am an 18-year-old boy who has been suffering from aggravated cough and phlegm for a while. It developed into a wheezing condition and I got medication for it. While the wheezing condition subsided, the phlegm condition persisted. After a few weeks of continuous coughing, I decided to seek medical attention again. However, my condition didnt improve. Since I was concerned, she advised me to get a full blood test and an ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate) along with an x-ray of my chest. While my blood test didnt reveal any defects, my x-ray didnt highlight any abnormalities as well. My ESR depicted a value of 55. I was told by the doctor, upon check up, that an ESR should generally be below 10 and 55 is unusual for someone my age, since it is usually that high in arthritis conditions. The only change that was done was a change in the antibiotic which didnt make that much of a difference in my condition. Could this be a normal condition that would brush over with time What does my ESR mean Should I be worried
Navin Rathnayake from Maharagama


Reply: As you havent mentioned the duration of your cough, but insists that you have been experiencing it for a while, I will assume that its a considerably long time. Considering the case in that aspect, you seem to be suffering from asthma and the wheezing condition that you have mentioned confirms it. From what you seem to say, despite the normal conditions of your blood tests and x-rays, your ESR has shown a high value. But I disagree with the fact that high ESR values could only depict arthritis. High ESR rates could also mean infections and inflammations which is most likely the case. In your condition, I think you are suffering from a chest infection as you seem to have been experiencing a lot of coughing and wheezing. The fact that you havent been recovering from the antibiotics could be due to the untimely taking of the antibiotic course. But there is a slight chance of your infection being a fungal one. If you are still taking medication, I suggest you take it on time without delay and check whether your condition improves. If that doesnt take place, seek medical attention from a consultant physician specialized in the respiratory area. You shouldnt be worried as I dont think its something serious. It just appears to be a case of aggravated asthma. Take your medication on time and stay away from cold beverages and follow good behavioural patterns that aid the subsiding of the cough condition you are experiencing.

A propaganda blitz to justify postponement of polls!
	

Despite the assurance given by polls authorities recently to hold the elections to provincial bodies dot on time, the yahapalanaya authorities are said to be miles away from any readiness or intent to hold either the local or provincial pools in the near future. The news coming down the grapevine says that strategies have been set in motion to further delay not only the local polls, but also the provincial polls.

These sources say that the political authorities are planning to justify further postponement of the polls on the pretext of seemingly attractive and positive reasons such as holding polls on one and the same day, increasing the womens representation in all bodies and restoring the ward system. Further, moves are reportedly afoot to manipulate the mass media to convey the message to the public that it is the civil society organizations responsible for the delay in holding the local and provincial polls and not the government. Five purohitas, two Greens, three Blues are to collectively head a propaganda campaign to disseminate the message that the postponement of the polls has resulted solely because of the governments  commitment to hold them in the most democratic manner possible.

Aloysiuss apple account accessed using his wifes mobile: ASG Kodagoda
	
Perpetual Treasuries Ltd owner, Arjun Aloysius Apple account, of which the password he doesnt remember, had been accessed within 48 hours prior to yesterdays proceedings through his wifes mobile phone, which has a Singaporean mobile number, Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda revealed at the PCoI proceedings yesterday.
The revelation was made in response to an application moved by Presidents Counsel Anuja Premaratne who appeared on behalf of Mr. Aloysius.
PC Premaratne was of the view that his client had bought the apple phone in September 2016 from Singapore, where he had created an apple account for the purpose of obtaining necessary applications only. He said thereafter Mr. Aloysius had not used the password.
Responding to ASG Yasantha Kodagodas earlier submission, Mr. Premaratne moved that in order to update the new version of the IOS, there was no need of the password.
Subsequently, there was a heated argument between the counsel over the necessity of the password in using an apple phone.
ASG Kodagoda replied that when an apple account was used frequently then it is a live account and, thereby, there was no need of the password always to update, if not the updates or downloading applications cannot be done without the password.
The ASG was of the view that the position put forward by Aloysius counsel was irrelevant and the Commission should not be spending time on inquiring into them.
The ASG also said that Mr. Aloysius had apparently lied to the Commission over his password and once it is proven, it will be communicated to the Court of Appeal on the allegation of Contempt.
PCoI Commissioner, Justice Prasanna Jayawardena told Aloysius Counsel that if Mr. Aloysius had forgotten the password, then the investigators have to retrieve it. However, if the investigation finds that he had lied, then appropriate measures will be taken under the law, he said.
ASG Kodagoda and ASG Dappula de Livera sought a directive from the Commission in order to prohibit Arjun Aloysius or anyone on behalf of him accessing the apple account, because there could be an attempt to erase information in the account.
However, before delivering an order, the Commission said it should be given within the law and asked the ASGs on what grounds it should be given.
ASG Livera explained that the Commission has already made a direction on Aloysius to provide his password and that directive should be secured at all costs and therefore another directive can be made effective in relation with the first order.
ASG Kodagoda also said that the directive can be made within the frame of the powers that are inherently possessed by the Commission.
Considering the submissions the Commission said it will decide on delivering such order later.(Shehan Chamika Silva)

An enlightened political leadership from father and son!
	

The gabby purohita who played a lead role in ushering in yahapalanaya after burning bridges behind the former strongman, has now embarked on a new mega plan to blaze the path for a new political journey, they say.

Talks are being held hush-hush behind the scene these days to finalize the preliminaries of the plan themed: An enlightened political leadership for the country.
Meanwhile, some political sources say that this plan is nothing but a roadmap designed for the purohita and his son to attain the peak of countrys political power pyramid.
The purohita and his son who have claimed their ability to give leadership to a powerful peoples movement had reportedly held their latest round of talks with a group of loyalists at a venue close to the Timbirigasyaya filling station.
Even those in the highest echelons in yahapalanaya have already received intelligence all about the purohitas ambitious plan and events to play out manifesting their reaction are only a matter of time, they say.

85 Batch of St. Annes College, Kurunegala: We Can
	
While enjoying a 150-year history St. Annes College, Kurunegala occupies a special place by inculcating knowledge at the correct age and correct time and by uplifting the spiritual segment and encouraging students to indulge in sport activities it has produced, gentlemen par excellence. 
St. Annes Church was built in 1861, and in 1864 an English medium school was begun in the church verandah for boys and girls. 
In 1867 the school with 101 students was registered by the Government. Until 1894 St. Annes was the only English medium school in Kurunegala. 
In 1934, Colombos then Archbishop the Most Rev. Peter Marque handed over the schools administration to the De La Salle brothers. It was then that Br. Hugh Farringdon with two other brothers thus started their mission. Under their guidance the school made rapid progress in studies, sports and discipline. The old boys association was begun in 1935. 
From that day onward with the assistance of De La Salle brothers, parents and past students this school has blossomed to be a role model among schools. 
St. Annes which is my Alma Mater has produced doctors, engineers, lawyers, educationalists many heroes who had sacrificed their lives for the unity and sovereignty of this country. 
The college motto is Possumus which means, We Are Able  We Can and we the children of this school have proved beyond doubt that we are capable of performing many feats. 
I am writing this article today to point out about the children who live and study under trying conditions and whose lives are not happy at all. 
Can we express such sentiments about the students who study in urban areas Dear parents, let us come forward to change the thinking of these students who live in this part of the country. These unfortunate young people often get isolated with their computers, laptops, tablets, smart phones and other paraphernalia. 
With every opportunity they get, these children keep on pressing the buttons of these devices. Even adults indulge in these activities, these days. We cannot save the adults, but we must try to salvage our children from these empty habits. 
Computers are essential to the modern world, which advances at a rapid pace. Let us not allow our children to be empty headed and get lost among these paraphernalia. 
So dear parents and elders let us thrive to create a world full of compassion empathy and kindness. 
The people who lived in the sixties, seventies, and eighties and before always led a meaningful life. Though we were not so advanced technically we led a somewhat contended life. There were ups and downs in our lives but yet we were not isolated. 
We mingled with each other to build our society. Like the motto of St. Annes we were able to serve and survive. 
By making the Sing-along project held on May 27 a very successful event, the batch of 85 has proved that it has the quality of overcoming all obstacles and forging ahead. 
The batch of 85 which felicitated its teachers will hold another felicitation ceremony for teachers on World Teachers Day on October 7. Rev. Brother A. E. Tarcisius the present principal performs a silent but yet a very conscientious duty of moulding students of St. Annes Collage into law-abiding duty conscious set of students who will serve our country sincerely and conscientiously.

Beware of tuk tuk scammers in Colombo!
	
The police believe these nefarious activities are linked to a drug ring
Three-wheelers -better known as tuk tuks-are an easy mode of travel around the city. As much as we think that they would make our lives easier, there have been instances when people had to think twice before using this mode of transport. While commuters have to worry about locked meters and even experience harassment during certain instances, several organised groups are engaging in a scam to make easy money. 
While speculation is rife as to why they are engaging in such notorious acts, the Daily Mirror sheds light on the current situation and how passengers could be more cautious when commuting in tuk tuks. 
Incidents reported on social media
Several of these scams were reported on social media and were brought to the notice of the Narahenpita Police. It was revealed that two brothers, Sajindu Anuradha Tillekeratne and Subash Anuradha Tillekeratne from Piliyandala and Pepiliyana are involved in the scam. According to the reports of victims they threaten and demand money as compensation, especially from female motorists, claiming that they have accidentally damaged their side mirrors. The Daily Mirror asked a few victims to share their experiences with us. 
This is *Nishadis experience: 
I was driving down Jawatta Road towards Bauddhaloka Mawatha around 6pm (I was to pick up a friend from Bates at 6.15pm to go for our University Re-Union). Just past the Italian Embassy there was a three-wheel guy driving in the middle of the lane, so I honked (a little aggressively as I was running late) and after a little more honking he moved and let me pass. However as I was passing him I realized that he was a little too close to my vehicle, but not close enough to make contact. A little while later I noticed he was honking at me and flashing lights. I felt as if he was following me and at the colour light I saw him trying to get my attention, but I ignored him and turned right. Then I realized that he was still following me. Then I turned towards CR&FC (in front of Radio Ceylon) and I noticed him turning as well. As I was taking the next bend to the left he was honking and screaming at me. When I stopped, he came around the passenger side window and asked whether I didnt see or hear him. When I responded he said that I have knocked on his side mirror. But when I apologized, he said the mirror costs Rs. 5000 and if I paid half he can get it fixed and that the cops would catch him if he didnt have one. I said I dont have any money with me and then he asked me to give any amount I had in hand and he even claimed to have got injured. He tried showing me some wound near his eyebrow which was not there and he also couldnt find and there was no blood either. Thats when I realized I was probably being scammed, but it was around 6.15pm and was getting pretty dark, I was late and he was standing at my window. I said I cant see your wound, but if you need help with the mirror all I can give you is Rs. 1000. Then he kept pestering me and didnt go away. He continued with the grievance of how he got hurt and complained about the mirror. I felt bad... I normally dont carry cash, but that day I had some money, so I gave him another 1000 and said that thats all I have in hand. He then thanked, blessed me and left. 
Raveen was another individual who was a victim of this scam. This is his experience: 
The incident took place about a month back. My wife and I were on our way home from work. At around 7.30pm we were on Kotte Road and there was a trishaw in front of us, driving in the middle of the road. He didnt make way for me nor the other vehicles on the road. In order to prevent holding up the trail of vehicles behind me, I overtook him with great care. As soon as we passed the vehicle, we heard the sound of an object falling behind us. Since we were careful when we overtook him, we didnt think we had anything to worry about, so we kept on driving. About three or four minutes later the trishaw was trailing behind us, honking and flashing his headlights. While doing so he lifted up a broken side mirror for us to see. Since it was quite dark, my wife thought it was a part of our vehicle, so we pulled over and stopped. The trishaw guy parked behind us, and walked up to the passenger seat window. He kept rubbing on our side mirror and mumbling something (it was only later we realised that while doing so he was actually scraping our side mirror). I got off the vehicle to check what the issue was. It was only then he said that we had knocked down his side mirror and that it would cost him Rs.1500 to get it fixed. I checked my side mirror, and it was scratched in a really odd way. However, since it was dark, he looked dodgy, and I didnt want to stir up any trouble, especially because of my wife was also in the car and didnt want to leave her alone in the vehicle, I gave him the Rs. 1500, got back and drove away. 
*Name withheld under strict conditions of anonymity
If asked to go to the Police they refuse and instead bargain for money. Since the owners feel embarrassed, they have paid huge sums close to Rs. 6000. But the actual cost of a side mirror is Rs. 150
These scammers may be linked to a drug ring : Narahenpita OIC
Narahenpita Police OIC Gayan Prasanna told the Daily Mirror that the two brothers have been engaged in these scams for some time. When we investigated in to the matter we found that they have fixed their side mirrors in such a way so that they would fall at any moment. While the usual mechanism is for its spherical lock to be fixed upwards, they have it facing downwards. So even if they come in to contact with a car, the side mirror has a tendency to brush past its surface. Then they come as close as possible with the vehicle they want to victimize and pretend to have met with an accident. Thereafter they take the side mirror in their hand and ask the people driving the vehicle to be more cautious and go on talking about the cost. If asked to go to the Police they refuse and instead bargain for money. Since the owners feel embarrassed, they have paid huge sums close to Rs. 6000. But the actual cost of a side mirror is Rs. 150. 
Speaking further he said that this is part of a business and they may be linked to a drug ring. We arrested one of the suspects by the name Subash Anuruddha Tillekaratne driving the three-wheel with number WP ABE 4844 and was bailed out after paying a cash bail of rupees two lakhs. In order to track individuals engaging in such scams we are in the process of conducting an islandwide line up along with the Colombo Crime Division (CCD). Here we get the photos and fingerprints of these people and include them in a database. Then once we receive a complaint we will search for the name and track them down eventually, he said.
Professional tuk tuk drivers dont engage in such notorious acts : AITWOA Chairman
According to All Island Three-Wheel Owners Association (AITWOA) Chairman Sudhil Jayaruk professional three-wheel drivers dont have time to engage in such notorious acts. They in fact dont have time to waste because they have to go on their daily rounds and earn their living. But theres a group that is involved in the drug business and they are the ones causing trouble. So they would come up with fake accidents such as those portrayed in these scams and try to earn some extra money. A side mirror for example wont cost a huge sum of money; it could be bought for Rs. 150 and the matter could be solved in that case. But the underlying issue is that these notorious individuals are ruining the profession. We in fact requested the government to identify professional three-wheel drivers and give them a licence and a proper training regarding road rules and the civil laws,Jayaruk said.
Jayaruk further said that if he came across people involved in such scams he would definitely help the Police to nab the culprits. The three-wheel driver has a big responsibility vested upon him when transporting passengers. Therefore scams such as these shouldnt be encouraged. But on the other hand there are instances when luxury vehicles come into contact with three-wheelers, but the drivers refuse to pay. So the poor three-wheel driver has to bear the costs. Therefore we need to look at these issues in all perspectives and derive a solution,he added.

T. Amarasinghe
T. Amarasinghe says that so far he has never come across any passenger who has been harassed by a three-wheel driver. There may be instances when these incidents happen, but Im not aware of them. The blame should go to the younger generation because they sometimes think that its easier to earn money that way. But thats very wrong. On the other hand victims of three-wheel scams should report these incidents to the police because its only then that the law would be enforced,opined Amarasinghe.
Jayantha Jayasinghe
Has been a three-wheel driver for the past 12 years. He says that since they are doing a job, harassment doesnt usually happen. We want to do this professionally and I dont think any professional three-wheel driver would harass customers. I have hardly taken a tourist on a ride for the past few months and we take extra care when we work with them because if anything goes wrong its bad for the country. I also cannot accept the so-called scams that are going on these days because the victim should have the brains to question the three-wheel driver before paying money.
I strongly condemn such acts and would like to ask the younger generation to be more responsible,said Jayasinghe.
Premadasa Mallawa
Has been in the profession for over 20 years. He said that parents buy three-wheelers for young boys as soon as they leave school. They dont have discipline and would go on to the extent of harassing passengers and taking money. During the past few days we saw how three-wheel drivers harassed tourists. Im not aware of the scams that are going on, but they are degrading our profession. These young boys are trying to find money the easy way, but thats not good for the rest of the three-wheel drivers. 
Joseph
According to Joseph only an organised group would engage in such scams. This is the same with meters as well. Sometimes their meters are working, but they would say that the meter is broken and over-charge passengers. If one comes across these people they should be reported to Police. However much we are genuine, people will view us in the same way they view these notorious individuals and it would eventually affect us,affirmed Joseph.

Janaka
Janaka is another three-wheel driver who has recently taken to this profession. Although he too wasnt aware of the scams, he condemned them. Those involved in the drug business have notorious ways of earning money. So these scams should also be part of their mission. Young boys become three-wheel drivers because they cant do another which demands a qualification. So they will eventually fall into the wrong hands and go to the extent of demeaning the profession,said Janaka.

Gunapala
Im not aware of these scams, said Gunapala, another three-wheel driver who is quite new to the profession. Once I met with an accident in Borella and the person in the vehicle gave me money and asked to fix the broken side mirror. I think the younger generation should be more cautious and disciplined because they too are doing a job, he said.

Caught playing double game
	

A pro-JO politico from the periphery having sneaked a meeting with a very high political authority the other day had made an appeal to the latter to remove a certain provincial purohita highly critical of yahapalanaya and appoint him in his place.

This politico apart from being a JO supporter is known to be a loyalist of a senior stalwart of the JO.
The senior JO stalwart on hearing about the politicos secret meeting with the high political authority had taken him to task and warned him of dire consequences if he were caught playing a double game again,they say.

Commercial Bank share sale boosts DFCC June quarter
	
DFCC Bank PLC reported earnings of Rs.5.84 a share or Rs.1.54 billion for its April  June quarter (2Q17) compared to the Rs.747 million profit it recorded during the same period last year as the sale of shares it held in Commercial Bank helped the banking group to prop up its performance.
During the quarter, the bank sold more than 10 million shares of Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC, making a gain of Rs.1.07 billion and recognized it under net gain from financial investments as the shares were held under available-for-sale financial assets.
Meanwhile, the trading gains mostly consisted of gilt-edged assets fell by 43 percent to Rs.119.3 million from a year ago.   
The bank made a net interest income of Rs.2.74 billion, a 33 percent increase from a year ago as the loans grew by Rs.13 billion while the margins also edged up to 3.6 percent from 3.3 percent during the 6 months to June 30, 2017.
The earnings for the same period grew by 71 percent to Rs.10.98 a share or Rs.2.9 billion which also included the gains from the share sale.     
The external environment was fairly challenging due to rising taxes and pressure on margins in the face of interest rate volatility experienced during the year, said Arjun Fernando, the banks Chief Executive Officer in an earnings release.   
The bank on a standalone basis has a loan book of Rs.205.5 billion and a total asset base of Rs.305 billion, up 5 percent during the first half of the yar.

Double dealer riding double decker booed
	

Two double decker buses were deployed recently under a tourist promotion drive launched in a city dotted with numerous sites of religious and cultural significance.

Soon after the inauguration of this tourist bus service, the chief purohita and a certain recently appointed provincial purohita had taken a ride right round the city in a double decker. However, the VIP duo riding around the city were in for a very unpleasant surprise when groups of people who had gathered at several points on the route greeted them with boos.
It later transpired that boos and jeers were mainly directed at the recently appointed provincial purohita who had become a thick chum of the chief purohita after a bid led by him to oust the latter had failed. The crowds had shouted slogans deriding and condemning the provincial purohita for now kissing a hand he tried hard to cut.

Repeating its feat for the sixth consecutive year, NDB Investment Bank (NDBIB) was once again crowned as Sri Lankas Best Investment Bank 2017 by the prestigious Euromoney Magazine.
The award was presented at a gala event held at the Island Shangri-La Hotel in Hong Kong attended by regional and global heavyweights in the banking industry. This award has also propelled NDBIB as the winner of most consecutive awards by Euromoney in Sri Lanka.
Euromoney has been the leading publication covering international finance for almost 50 years. Euromoneys Awards for Excellence attracted almost 1,500 submissions this year and is aimed at recognising the best financial services organisations via an intensely competitive selection process.
Following a record-breaking year in 2015, NDBIB managed to raise Rs.48 billion in 2016, in both debt and equity capital, despite the subdued market conditions, the second highest in terms of funds raised during a given year in the history of NDBIB. The performance assumed greater significance in light of the policy uncertainties in Sri Lanka and volatile global political events.
NDBIB continued its vigorous quest for innovation by introducing several new structures and products to the Sri Lankan capital markets. A case in point is the maiden introduction of a cornerstone tranche for an IPO in Sri Lanka in line with the best practices in regional markets. NDBIB CEO Darshan Perera stated, Being awarded as the best in the country at what we do for six consecutive years is no small achievement. NDBIB has continuously sought out new challenges and avenues to express ourselves as the pioneers of innovation in the local capital market. I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to our esteemed clientele who have placed their trust in us and been with us through this journey.
Despite weak market conditions, NDBIB remained active across all business verticals maintaining its stature as the unparalleled leader and preferred investment bank for debt/equity capital raising, M&A and advisory deals in 2016. NDBIB raised Rs.31.5 billion via listed debentures and maintained its leadership position by retaining a market share of 37.4 percent in 2016. The highlight of the year was NDBIBs innovative introduction of a structured debt product for the Laugfs group raising Rs.4 billion.
NDBIB was also active in the M&A sphere acting as the financial advisor to Mobitel in its maiden acquisition, E-Channelling and entry into the fast-growing e-healthcare space. NDBIB structured the acquisition and also managed the voluntary offer by Mobitel to the shareholders of E-Channelling.
Amidst limited equity market activity, NDBIBs expertise was sought by Sanasa Development Bank on a fundraising via a private placement that comprised equity, convertible debt and senior debt. Two Development Finance Institutions (IFC and FMO) and SBI FMO Emerging Asia Financial Sector Fund committed to participate in the fundraising of US $ 23 million. NDBIB COO Kaushini Laksumanage commented, This is the perfect reward for the dedication and hard work put in by our very talented team. Over the years we have undoubtedly been blessed with amazing personalities that have driven us to where we are today.
NDBIBs advisory expertise was sought by the Silvermill Group of Companies and Citrus Leisure Group to carry out restructuring exercises whilst NDBIB managed the share repurchases by four companies belonging to the Carson Cumberbatch group, which amounted to over Rs.13 billion, the largest ever share repurchase in Sri Lanka by a group.
NDBIBs corporate advisory arm was also actively involved in other capital market transactions, which included advising clients from sectors such as banking and finance, telecommunication and real estate on valuations, fundraisings, mergers and acquisitions transactions, delistings and scrip dividend issues.
In 2016, NDBIB also made a leap in broadening its regional presence by being mandated via a competitive process as sole financial advisor to manage the IPO of the Maldivian subsidiary of the Global Telco Ooredoo, which was successfully completed in 2017. The transaction saw NDBIB become the first Sri Lankan investment bank to manage a foreign IPO.
The corporate culture at NDBIB is based on maintaining the highest ethical standards with honesty and integrity as its hallmarks. NDBIB adheres to strict compliance and ethical guidelines, including the CFA Code of Conduct, an internal policy framework for compliance and industry best practices.
With NDB Capital Bangladesh also being awarded Bangladeshs Best Investment Bank 2017, NDB Investment Banking Cluster has maintained its record for the third time by being the only local investment-banking group in Asia to be named as the Best Investment Bank simultaneously in two countries.
NDBIB is the investment banking subsidiary of NDB Capital Holdings, the largest full-service investment banking group in the country holding a complementary business portfolio consisting of fee-based and fund-based investment banking, wealth management, managing private equity and stockbroking.

GMOA wants details of staff attached to NFTH
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today referred a letter to Health Ministry Secretary Janaka Sugathadasa requesting for information on the staff of medical officers attached to the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH) under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.
GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge told a news conference that they had earlier referred a letter to Mr. Sugathadasa requesting for a copy of the agreement signed on acquiring the NFTH to the government under the RTI and added that there was no response with regard to it.
Even the Supreme Court has allowed the GMOA to intervene into this issue. Despite such a condition, the ministry has not provided us with a copy of the agreement. We are forced to take legal actions against this incident in future, he said.
He said that it was a question whether the doctors and nurses who had earlier worked at the NFTH, would now be considered as government officers or not. He also said that it was a question whether these staff members had been offered with appointment letters, if they had taken to the government cadre.
It is necessary to consider about the qualifications of these staff member and their standards to work as government officers, he said.
Meanwhile, he said that the National Protest Day (NPD) organised by the SAITM Virodi Jana Pawra in protest of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) was successfully held today across the country.
He said that all the unions attached to the healthcare services, political parties, university students, parents and several other trade unions attached to the government and private sector had participated in these protests.
He said that they had carried out the main protest march against the SAITM from the National Hospital of Sri Lanka (NHSL) premises to the Health Ministry today. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
