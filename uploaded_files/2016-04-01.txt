Gammanpila, Bandula find luggages missing in Geneva
	
Joint opposition MPs Udaya Gammanpila and Bandula Gunawardane who flew to Geneva found their luggage missing upon arrival at the airport, it is learnt.
The duo, along with MP Dalles Alahapperuma, took wing to Geneva on three different flights to meet authorities of the Inter Parliamentary Union (IPU) headquarteres in Geneva. Mr. Gammanpila arrived first at the Geneva airport and found his baggage missing, apparently not been loaded into the aircraft by port of origin. He later brought it to the notice of the Geneva airport authorities formally.
By the time, Mr. Gunawardane landed, he had excitedly run towards Mr. Gammanpila saying he had found his luggage missing.
Mr. Gammanpila had responded in a lighter vein,? You are most welcome to the club of those with missing baggages." Mr. Gunawardane had stacked enough clothes in his hand luggage, but Mr. Gammanpila had left all his belongings in the main luggage that was missing. So, he had to buy everything right down to the tooth brush.
However, the report compiled by the joint opposition to be handed over to the IPU, was in the computer bag of Mr. Gammanpila, saving them from a facing a major dilemma. (Kelum Bandara)

Missing Persons Commission Chairman Maxwell Paranagama had stated that four of those who had gone missing had been found while two or three of them were languishing in Maldivian prisons responding to a question raised by media personnel after the hearings ended in Vavuniya.
He said that investigations were held based on evidence placed with the Commission.
"Four of them had been found now and we will release the details soon. We have found that two or three of them who had gone missing are languishing in the Maldivian jails. We have also come to know of a person alleged to have gone missing in Welioya had gone abroad via the Katunayake Airport accompanying another woman. Investigation on others was progressing. Though we could not find them all, steps have been taken to respond favourably," he said.
We had more complaints on the Army in the North while many complaints had been recorded blaming the Tigers in the Wanni. In addition, PLOTE, EPRLF and the EPDP of Douglas were also answerable.
Around 1,049 people in Wanni placed their evidence and 306 new requests were made during the six days of hearing in the Wanni. The new requests had increased as the people had placed their confidence in us, he said.
"We cannot tell the exact number of those gone missing as yet because the relatives of missing persons living in different parts had made separate requests to us," Chairman said. (Navaraththinam Kapilnath)

MR should make a statement in Parliament: Ranil
	
Responding to former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, who had told him that the government should focus on the country?s security following the recent detection of hidden arms and ammunition, and the comments made by former minister G. L. Peiris, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday that Mr. Rajapaksa should make a statement in parliament and Professor Peiris should divulge to the police all of the information he had on the subject.
Speaking at a function in Colombo, Mr. Wickremesinghe said Mr. Rajapaksa should make a statement in the House so that they could discuss it and take measures to safeguard the country.
?We can discuss the incident in parliament and take suitable steps if he makes a statement,? he said.
?I doubted whether this function would take place today when I read the morning papers. I wondered whether there would be WTC style attack here. Professor G L Peiris has spoken of such a thing . I inquired from the police and they said there was no such threat,? he said.
He said Mr. Rajapaksa had phoned and told him to investigate the matter. He said he had informed President Maithripala Sirisena of it and discussed it with Minister Sagala Ratnayake. He said it was decided to investigate it. He said he would make a statement in parliament next week .
He said such hauls were a common occurrence after a war. ?You still come across arms and ammunition hidden during the Second World War. Some ammunition and love letters written by an American soldier to his fianc? were found in a house in the UK recently? he said.
He said such incidents had taken place in Sri Lanka as well, and sometimes the government was tipped off by the Tamils themselves.
He said there may be attempts to sabotage the economic development plans of the government, and the LTTE and other anti government groups could be involved in such attempts. ?Perhaps both are doing it together,? he said.
He said the government analyst had been asked to help in the investigation.
?Terrorism should not be allowed to re-emerge but steps should be taken to stop communalism,? he said. (Yohan Perera)

New report from ACCA identifies massive talent challenges in global finance functions
	
A new report from ACCA (the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants) suggests that current talent management practices are falling short.
The new report launches ACCA?s global campaign examining talent management practices in today?s finance function. ?Talent Equation: First Insights? reveals the current state of play of finance talent globally. ? ? ?
?
This is the first of five reports to be published by ACCA that will form a comprehensive research programme of finance talent management practices. Over the next 18 months, the programme will assess and address the critical talent challenges that organisations and their finance leaders face.
Capturing the views of nearly 600 finance professionals across the globe, the report provides a baseline understanding of the major issues. The initial findings suggest that attracting, developing, engaging and retaining finance professionals is becoming increasingly challenging. A career spent in the finance function may no longer be the prime aspiration of newer entrants to the profession (and those that follow), changing business model and operating footprints may be opening up new ways for the enterprise to tap into ?finance? talent.
OmidTissier, ACCA?s senior manager said, ?The initial data collected suggests there is a growing maturity of finance shared services and outsourcing. 55 percent of organisations have had shared services and outsourcing models in place longer than 6 years. Yet as finance continues to evolve its delivery model, new challenges in developing talent are emerging.
?Retained finance roles are still valued higher than shared service roles in developing tomorrow?s global finance leaders. The aspirations of the younger generation in today?s finance function may be changing too. 70% agree that young finance professionals want a career that ultimately extends out of finance.?
Jamie Lyon, ACCA head of corporate sector, commented: ?When shared services were initially set up around 15 to 20 years ago the key driver was for efficiency and cost savings. But as these operations have continued to move up the value chain, we have seen a huge pool of talent develop which is of value right across the finance organisation. Equally, time served in shared services can help develop the broader business and management skills needed by todays? corporate leaders, so it is imperative that this talent is tapped into both in finance and across the wider enterprise?.?

People?s Leasing & Finance initiates ?THURU? reforestation programme
	
?
In an outset where deforestation in Sri Lanka is a grave environmental concern, restoration and re-planting of forests offer a major opportunity to off-set emissions and reduce the global issue of climate change by increasing the green cover.?
In supporting the national policy of increasing the forest cover from 29% to 33%, PLC collaborated with the ForestsDepartment to spearhead a flagship re-forestation programme themed ?THURU? in Kanneliya, Udawatta and along Trincomalee - Habarana route. The re-forestation programmes at the afore said sites are spearheaded by the District Forest Offices and the PLC branches located in Galle, Kandy and Kantale.?
The first re-forestation drive of this flagship programme commenced in Kanneliya on the 25th July 2015 in Kanneliya where 450 seedlings that are suitable for the local climatic conditions including Hora (Dipterocarpuszeylanicus), Halmilla (Berryacordifolia) , Beraliya (Shoreacordifolia), Goraka (Garciniacambogia) and Wewal (Calamuszeylanicus) planted to restore the forest cover in partnership with the District Forest Office - Galle.?
?The area was congested with Havari Nuga (Alstoniascholaris) trees. It is an invasive plant that inhibits the natural forest cover. Generally, an invasive plant is not native to a specific location and has a tendency to spread and cause damage to the respective eco system. Alstonia plants were girdled to perish over time allowing the newly planted native plant species that belongs to the respective eco system thrive. We appreciate the enthusiasm shown by People?s Leasing in the sphere of environment conservation towards a cleaner and greener planet.? said Mohan Heenatigala, District Forest Officer, Galle.?
?PLC has completed the first phase of the project planting 450 saplings. We have made arrangements to raise 1,000 saplings at the nursery of the Galle District Forest Office with the on-set of the rainfall in March. PLC has committed to ensure that saplings they planted are well established in the eco system,? said Nishantha Weerasinghe, Head of PLC Galle Branch.
The second re-forestation drive of this flagship programme, was spearheaded by PLC Kantale. Kantale branch of PLC in partnership with the District Forest Office, Polonnaruwa initiated seedling establishment in Forests Department nursery to be planted along Trincomalee - Habarana stretch of the road with the on - set of rain in November 2015. Planting programme was held on 24th November 2015 where 6,000 seedlings that are suitable for the local climatic conditions including Kohomba (Azadirachtaindica), Halmilla (Berryacordifolia), Mee (Madhucallongifolla) and Damba (Paretroplusdamil) planted near Galoya Junctionalong Trincomalee ? Habarana Roadto restore the forest cover in partnership with the District Forest Office - Polonnaruwa.10,000saplingsare expected to be established along 5 km stretch and maintaining the ?Green Belt? until the seedlings are well established in the site.
?Since the percentage of the forest cover in Sri Lanka is gradually decreasing due to various reasons, reforestation programmes are been conducted across the country by Forest Department. But, unfortunately, numbers of annual restoration programmes are not enough to increase and maintain a proper percentage of the forest cover, specially in dry zone. As a responsible finance company, People?s Leasing & Finance PLC has initiated to maintain the ?Green Belt? along 5 km distance of Trincomalee-Habarana road side. We appreciate this green effort of PLC and their contribution towards cleaner and greener planet,? said H.G. Wasantha, District Forest Officer, Polonnaruwa.
The third re-plantation drive was spearheaded by PLC Kandy with the partnership of the District Forest Office, Kandy. The programme was held on 1st of December 2015 at Udawatta forest where 2,000 plants including Mee (Madhucallongifolla), Kubuk (Terminaliaarjuna), Gammalu (Pterocarpusmarsupium), Goraka (Garciniacambogia) and Kambaranka (Averrhoacarambola) were planted and another 1,000 seedlings are expected to be planted in 4 ha by uprooting the invasive plant Maana grass.
?Invasive species like Maana grass is a huge threat to the bio diversity of a natural forest cover. Therefore we have to clear all the Maana grass in the view point of Udawatta forest and establish a forest cover with native plants species respective to that eco system. It is highly appreciated that People?s Leasing & Finance PLC does a great job to support this forest restoration programme not only financially, but also through active participation.? said Ms. Satheema Aluwihare, District Forest Officer, Kandy.

While ruling a country it is important to consider the physical, social development of the country in addition to national security.
Today we suspect that an issue relating to the national security of the country has surfaced
With the discovery of explosives and a suicide kit in the north it is essential that the public be kept informed of the actual security situation,? said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa during a Bodhi Pooja held at the Pinwatte Purana Raja Maha Viharaya in Dehiwala yesterday.
The former President also said that this incident should not be regarded as something trivial, and suitable action should be taken to dispel the suspicion and the fear that is now developing in the country.
He said the people are intelligent enough to understand when a threat is posed to national security. Therefore it is vital for the government to keep the people informed about the correct situation, without accusing others and attempting to lock them up. (H M Dharmapala)
