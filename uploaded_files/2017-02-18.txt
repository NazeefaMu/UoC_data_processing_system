?
At least 72 people were killed and more than 150 injured in a suicide attack on the shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar in Sehwan on Thursday evening. ??
?So far 72 people have been killed and more than 150 have been wounded,? Inspector General Police Sindh A.D. Khawaja said. ??
?Many of the wounded are in critical condition and they will be shifted to Karachi as soon as navy helicopters and the C-130 plane reach the nearest airport.? ??
Medical Superintendant Dr Moinuddin Siddiqui of Sehwan Taluka Hospital confirmed that 61 bodies were received by the hospital. ??
?Almost all the bodies were brought here. We have handed over 26 bodies to the heirs of the deceased, while those that remain unidentified are at the hospital,? said Siddiqui ??
Deputy Commissioner Munawar Maheesar confirmed the dead included at least four children and 12 women. The Assistant Superintendent of Police in Sehwan said a suicide bomber entered the shrine through its Golden gate. The attacker blew himself up after throwing a grenade, which failed to explode, he added. ??
The explosion took place in the area where the dhamaal (a Sufi ritual) was being performed after evening prayers. ?A large number of devotees, from different faiths and from across the country, frequent the shrine on Thursdays ? a day of spiritual significance in Pakistan?s shrine culture. ??
Security for shrines was tightened across the province following the attack. ?

## Title: BJP weighing up ?political split? in Rajapaksa camp?

BJP weighing up ?political split? in Rajapaksa camp?
	
Even as Sri Lanka?s former President Mahinda Rajapaksa angles for a political comeback, New Delhi appears to be weighing up possible political shifts in the island, including a split in the Rajapaksa camp, the Hindu reported.
On February 10, BJP national general secretary Ram Madhav, known to be Prime Minister Narendra Modi?s point man on Sri Lanka, met President Maithripala Sirisena and PM Ranil Wickremesinghe in Colombo, a week before Foreign Secretary S. Jaishankar?s scheduled official visit.
Mr. Madhav also met a few other key political actors, The Hindu learns, and reportedly discussed political options that might ?neutralise? former strongman Rajapaksa. Confirming that he met the President and the Prime Minister to discuss bilateral issues and a forthcoming Indian Ocean conference in the island, Mr. Madhav, when contacted in New Delhi, said ?the [other] allegations are false?.
While he categorically denied having discussed the former first family in any of his meetings, political sources in Colombo told The Hindu that the BJP?s key strategist seemed to explore the possibility of Gotabaya Rajapaksa decamping from Mahinda Rajapaksa in return for high political office.
One of Sri Lanka?s most controversial figures and brother of the ex-President, Mr. Gotabaya was prominent in the leadership to defeat the LTTE, playing a key role as Secretary to the Ministry of Defence and Urban Development.
Currently facing corruption charges for allegedly transferring state-owned weapons to a private firm, causing a loss of nearly $75 million to the country, he has been a staunch critic of the government?s reconciliation strategy.
While Mr. Madhav?s reported enquiries about him have raised eyebrows in political circles, its timing is also significant.
Two years after coming to power, Sri Lanka?s national unity government ? formed by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) that President Sirisena leads and its rival United National Party with PM Wickremesinghe at the helm ? is pulling apart.
Amid mounting criticism over the government?s delay in delivering its key election promises, coupled with looming corruption charges, the government is facing another immediate task for its survival ? managing the ex-President, who leads a faction of the SLFP. This political grouping is challenging virtually every move of the government as a ?joint opposition? in Parliament.
Meanwhile, Mr. Rajapaksa has become increasingly vocal in his criticism of India. Observing that New Delhi has been ?mouse-like? on the current government?s China policy, while it objected to his, the former President has accused India of plotting his defeat in the January 2015 elections.
Even as Colombo tries to iron out issues with Beijing on a massive port and investment zone being built with Chinese assistance, Mr. Rajapaksa went to China in late 2016 on an invitation from the government.
At the same time, Colombo-New Delhi ties improved visibly with Mr. Modi?s visit to the neighbouring country in 2015, the first bilateral visit by an Indian Prime Minister in nearly three decades.
India and Sri Lanka are currently negotiating a trade deal and exploring partnerships in the strategically crucial eastern city of Trincomalee, in addition to collaborating on development projects. Mr. Madhav is a frequent visitor to Colombo and a known emissary of Mr. Modi. Foreign Secretary Mr. Jaishankar, who arrives on Saturday for a two-day visit, will meet the Sri Lankan President, Prime Minister and other key political actors.

Many attempts by diaspora Tigers to foment violence in Sri Lanka
	
?
By D.B.S.Jeyaraj
The ongoing investigation conducted by the Police Terrorism Investigation Department (TID) into the assassination plot targeting Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Jaffna district MP Mathiaparanam Abraham Sumanthiran has unearthed more details about the conspiracy hatched by ?Tigerish? elements in the Global Tamil Diaspora. ??
Five former members of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) now in custody have divulged much information about how three individuals living overseas had conspired, instigated and instructed them on how to execute the assassination plot on Sumanthiran. All communication between the overseas ?handlers? and the five ex-Tigers in Sri Lanka had been through the telephone. Police were authorised by courts to send the telephones used by the five suspects to the Moratuwa University for further decryption and analysis. ??
According to information provided by security related sources, the would-be assassins had attempted thrice to target the TNA parliamentarian. Their efforts had proved abortive due to circumstances beyond their control. All three attempts were aimed at assassinating Sumanthiran MP by using explosive devices while he was travelling along the B-402 Soranpatru-Thaalayadi road. The TNA parliamentarian was unaware of all three attempts until the arrest of suspects afterwards. ??
The first planned attempt was to have occurred on December 12, 2016 when Sumanthiran MP was on his way to a cultural festival held in Maruthankerni in the Jaffna peninsula. The plot had failed because the MP had been travelling in the vehicle of TNA Northern Province Councillor Kesavan Sayanthan instead of his own vehicle. This had confused the would be assassins. ??
The second attempt was to have taken place on Dec 26, 2016. The suspects were aware that the TNA parliamentarian was in Jaffna on Dec 24. They had expected him to attend the Tsunami anniversary event in Maruthankerni-Thaalayadi on Dec 26. Sumanthiran however had returned to Colombo on Dec 25 to be at home with his family for Christmas. Thus he did not go for the Tsunami event as anticipated by the suspects. ??
The third attempt was to be on Jan 13, 2017 when Sumanthiran MP was expected to participate at a forum on setting up a de-salination plant at Maruthankerni. Initially he was scheduled to travel along with his wife. However, he was forced to cancel his plans to go to Jaffna at the last minute due to unexpected reasons. Therefore the suspects could not go through with their plot as envisaged. ??
?
Two payments of?Rs. 800,000 and 600,000 ??
Informed security related sources opine that the three persons from overseas who interacted with the five ex-Tigers in Sri Lanka to execute the assassination plot against Sumanthiran belonged to the Diaspora LTTE organization headed by Norway based Perinbanayagam Sivaparan alias ?Nediyavan?. They are ?Maran? from France, ?Vetri? from Australia and ?Amuthan? from Malaysia. Detailed instructions on how to go about the assassination were issued regularly by Vetri from down under. Maran from France was the distributor of cash. Police have so far traced two payments of Rs. 800,000 and Rs. 600,000 being sent by Maran to Lanka. ??
Amuthan also known as ?Yarl Amuthan? is reportedly the mastermind behind the plot. He had been in overall charge coordinating matters. Amuthan though based in Malaysia had been using a Brazilian SIM card. Initially, the TID suspected that the nom de plume Amuthan was another name for the senior LTTE intelligence operative whose nom de guerre was ?Chiranjeevi Master? and was suspected of being in a South East Asian country. A voice test done on a telephone conversation with Amuthan revealed that Amuthan was not Chiranjeevi. Malaysian officials feel that Amuthan is no longer in Malaysia.
??
TID officials have also recorded statements from the five ex-Tigers arrested in connection with the assassination attempts. Four of the five were first produced at the Kilinochchi District magistrates court before District Judge. A. A. Anandarajah and were remanded to fiscal custody. They are being held at the Anuradhapura prisons. ??
The case was next heard on January 30, 2017. The name of one more person was included as a suspect on that day. All five were remanded until February 13, 2017. The case was taken up again before Judge Anandarajah who re-remanded all five suspects until Feb 27. Police informed court that investigations were not over yet and that further information was expected to be uncovered. Though the Terrorism Investigation Dept in Vavuniya is conducting the probe it is reliably learnt that TID Director DIG Nalaka de Silva himself is directing his officials in this case. The TID is very keen on uncovering more details about the overseas LTTE link in this matter. There is also suspicion that some Tamil politicians in Sri Lanka may have had a role in trying to get Sumanthiran killed. It is expected that after the investigation is concluded, an indictment would be filed in the High Court. ??
?
Kulendran alias ?Master? the ring leader ??
Police feel that the first suspect Karalasingham Kulendran alias ?Master? is the ring leader of the ex-Tiger group tasked with the mission of assassinating Sumanthiran. He was a senior member of the LTTE who was involved in training new Tiger recruits when the LTTE was active while the war was on. Since LTTE trainers were addressed as ?Master? by other cadres, Kulendran is still called by some as Master. Several of the ex-Tigers in custody as suspects along with ?Master? were reportedly trained by him. ??
37-year-old Kulendran ?Master? resides at 43/1, Thiruvaiyaaru in Kilinochchi. He is known to be closely associated with TNA Jaffna District MP Sivagnanam Shritharan whose political base is the Kilinochchi electoral division. Kulendran works as a senior executive at a leading finance company in Kilinochchi which specialises in loans, leasing and hire purchasing. Kulendran?s duties enable him to travel around in the North. A powerful claymore mine was recovered from Kulendran?s possession in Kilinochchi by the Police. The second suspect in custody is Gnanasekaralingam Rajmathan alias Vasudevan. Rajmathan is from Naduppirappanthidal in Thambalagaamam in Trincomalee district. Though Rajmathan has a wife and children in Trincomalee, he has been staying continually for many months in the north shuttling between Kilinochchi on the northern mainland and Thaalayadi in the Jaffna peninsula. Police recovered a locally manufactured explosive device and detonators from the place Rajmathan was staying in at Kilinochchi. ??
The third suspect is Murugaiya Thavendran, also from Kilinochchi. Thavendran who lost a hand in an explosion when he was active in the LTTE resides in a house near the 3rd mile post on Wilson street in Thiruvaiyaaru in Kilinochchi. 32-year-old Thavendran known also as ?Thavam? surrendered to the Army at Oamanthai on May 18, 2009. He was detained at the Nelukkulam camp for 10 months and released on March 7, 2010 after undergoing rehabilitation. ??
?
Clandestine sea passage?to India ??
The fourth suspect is Velayuthan Vijayakumar also known as Vijayan. Vijayan was arrested on January 19, 2017 but was not produced in courts along with the other arrested persons on Jan 20, 2017. He was produced at the Kilinochchi courts with the others when the case was taken up on Jan 30. Vijayakumar alias Vijayan is a native of Vaettiaiyaanmurippu in Mannar. The powerful claymore mine in Kulendran?s possession was reportedly supplied by Vijayan to master. Inquiries have revealed that Vijayan had been earlier involved in arranging clandestine sea passage to India for LTTE suspects wanted for a different offence. Investigators believe that Vijayan would have helped fellow suspects to go to India by boat after the assassination. ??
The fifth suspect is from Thaalayadi on the eastern littoral of the Jaffna peninsula. He is a rehabilitated former LTTE member now driving a trishaw. The man whose name is Mariyanayagam Lewis Ajanthan is also known by the nom de plume Jana. His nom de guerre while in the LTTE was Kadalavan. Inquiries have revealed that it was Kulendran master who provided finance to Mariyanayagam Ajanthan to buy his three-wheeler via a hire -purchase scheme. Ajanthan drove his vehicle in the areas of Thaalayadi, Maruthankerni, Sembiyanpatru and Maamunai. Since he stays indefinitely at all these places at times, the Police in their ?B? report have mentioned all four areas as Ajanthan?s addresses. TID also recovered a locally manufactured explosive device and detonators from Ajanthan?s possession. ??
An interesting aspect of this case is the fact that no charges have been filed under the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). Since the Government has decided to repeal and replace the PTA with new counter-terrorism legislation. The concerned TNA parliamentarian Sumanthiran who is also a leading lawyer has also been opposed to the PTA. The MP too has approved the decision to dispense with the PTA in this regard. Thus the suspects are not being detained for indefinite periods under the PTA for interrogation. They have been produced in courts and remanded to fiscal custody. The TID officials have no access to the suspects and if they want to record further statements the Police have to seek the court?s permission for it. Moreover, the Police can record statements from suspects only in the presence of prison guards. ??
?
Kilinochchi district Judge Anandarajah ??
When the assassination plot case (B 85/17) was taken up at the Kilinochchi courts before Kilinochchi District Judge A. A. Anandarajah on February 13, the Police filed a further addendum that provided more information about the assassination conspiracy. Police requested the court?s permission to take the suspects physically to certain places linked to the investigation and record further statements after ascertaining relevant facts. This was strongly objected to by lawyers representing Kulendran, Thavendran, Vijayakumar and Ajanthan. The lawyer representing Rajmathan after consulting him stated that his client was prepared to cooperate. ??
Thereafter Judge Anandarajah ordered that the Police could escort Gnanasegaralingam Rajmathan to places and conduct further investigations on February 20, 21 and 22. It is expected that the Police would take Rajmathan to different places in the Mannar, Kilinochchi and Jaffna districts in the North and also to the Trincomalee district in the East. Apparently Police suspect a greater ?Trinco link? in Diaspora Tiger activity aimed at fomenting violence in Sri Lanka.?
Besides Rajmathan?s family is in Thambalagaamam in Trinco. Police also requested courts to grant permission to record further statements from the other four suspects held at the Anuradhapura jail. Judge Anandarajah acceded to the request and ordered that Police could record further statements on Feb 14, 15 and 16 from Kulendran, Thavendran,Vijayakumar and Ajanthan. The case will be next heard on Feb 27 after the statements are duly recorded. ??
Inquiries and related legal proceedings so far have firmly established that three overseas LTTE operatives believed to be members of the Diaspora Tiger organization headed by Perinbanayagam Sivaparan alias Nediyavan have plotted, financed and instigated five former members of the LTTE in Sri Lanka to engage in the conspiracy and execution of a plot to assassinate TNA Jaffna district MP Sumanthiran. This has put a lot of egg on the faces of those who described the assassination attempt on Sumanthiran as a ?drama?. While the existence of a definite plot and related preparations to implement are conclusively proved what needs to be ascertained is whether the attempted assassination of Sumanthiran is part of a larger conspiracy to revive the LTTE or just an isolated plot targeting him alone. ??
Against that backdrop, it would be pertinent and important to delve briefly into the recent past. The LTTE was militarily defeated in May 2009. The Tigers ceased to be a viable or active entity in the Island. Over 12,000 former LTTE cadres were released from custody after undergoing a period of rehabilitation. However, the overseas structures of the LTTE remained intact but were seriously undermined by the fall of the LTTE in Sri Lanka. The Diaspora Tigers though active abroad could do very little damage in Sri Lanka as their capacity to engage in large scale violence on Lankan soil had virtually ended. ??
?
Perinbanayagam Sivaparan alias ?Nediyavan? ??
The Diaspora Tigers led by the Norway-based Perinbanayagam Sivaparan alias ?Nediyavan? or tall man has persisted with its efforts to engage in violence in Sri Lanka despite the end of war. The overseas Tigers have been trying to foment violence in Sri Lanka by utilising the ex-Tigers as their agents or instruments on Lankan soil. ?Mazhai Nindraalum Thooral Nitkavillai? is a saying in Tamil which means although the rain has ceased the drizzle has not ended. Likewise the Diaspora Tigers have been repeatedly attempting to revive the LTTE and foment violence in Sri Lanka even though the war is over. The latest Sumanthiran- assassination attempt is not the first instance of overseas Tigers promoting violence in the post-war years. It is not likely to be the last either. ??
There have been many attempts by the Diaspora Tigers to foment violence in Sri Lanka after the war ended. Some of these happened during the time Mahinda Rajapaksa was president and his sibling Gotabhaya, the all powerful Defence Secretary. The first instance was in the Trincomalee district. On March 17, 2012, the body of a Tamil youth with his throat slit, was discovered at Periyakulam in the Kuchaveli region of Trinco district. The dead person was Velayudhan Ragunathan alias Muthu, a member of the Eelam Peoples Democratic Party (EPDP) led by former Cabinet Minister Douglas Devananda. A handwritten note saying ?death to traitors? and a small LTTE flag with the tiger emblem was placed by the side. ??
The Sri Lankan State reacted in a state of panic. An intensive search-and-arrest operation was conducted in the Trincomalee district. Over 200 youths of both gender were arrested. Almost all of them were ex-LTTE cadres who had surrendered and been rehabilitated. Some former Tigers who had not been rehabilitated were also discovered and detained during the round up operations. They were sent to the Protective Accommodation and Rehabilitation Centre (PARC) at Welikanda for rehabilitation. ??
Information gleaned through interrogation of arrested persons sent alarm signals through the defence establishment. Further interrogation and investigation revealed information about an attempt to revive the LTTE in Sri Lanka with backing from tiger and pro-tiger elements from the global Tamil Diaspora.
??Kamalanathan Sadheeshkumar alias ?Kumaran? ??
It was learnt that a Tiger operative from France named Kamalanathan Sadheeshkumar alias ?Kumaran? had arrived in India in November 2011. He had gathered some ex-Tiger cadres living in Tamil Nadu State and organised clandestine meetings aimed at reviving the LTTE. Kumaran had recruited 15 members in Tamil Nadu and divided them into three cells comprising five members each. Members from one such cell were sent to Trincomalee on March 6, 2012.The objective was to carry out executions in the Trincomalee district. The killing of Ragunathan alias Muthu on March 17 was the first in this plan. Sadheeshkumar alias Kumaran is yet living in Paris but is apparently inactive now ??
The excessively hard crackdown by the Sri Lankan State saw this LTTE revival pilot project going awry. While a few of the cell were arrested the others fled back to India. The widespread round-ups in different parts of Trinco district and resultant mass arrests caused much alarm in the community. The TNA, which then had (and has now) the most number of Sri Lankan Tamil MP?s from the Northern and Eastern provinces protested vehemently against the large-scale arrests. ??
Two Parliamentarians from the TNA met with Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa in this regard. Gotabaya explained what had happened and informed the TNA of the revival attempt. He even offered to play recordings of purported telephone conversations between suspects in Sri Lanka with Diaspora elements. The Defence Secretary assured the TNA that the bulk of those arrested would be released in due course. The TNA went back apparently satisfied. Within a few days most of those arrested - except for a handful - were released. ??
The second LTTE revival attempt was detected in December 2012. The arrest of an non-rehabilitated ex-LTTE cadre in Colombo during the first week of December 2012 and subsequent interrogation resulted in a disturbing discovery. Details of an organized LTTE network operating in Chennai, Tamil Nadu with funds from Tiger elements in Europe came to light during preliminary inquiries.
?
??Tamil Nadu Tiger?network links ??
Further investigations led to the arrests of six more youths in Jaffna who were suspected of having links to the Tamil Nadu Tiger network. Two of the six were former women Tigers who had been released after undergoing rehabilitation. Subsequently the arrested suspects, except for two were released. ??
More information was garnered from the suspects in custody. The information revealed was shocking. According to the detained youths a clandestine campaign was underfoot in Tamil Nadu to recruit from among refugees in Tamil Nadu, Sri Lankan Tamil youths sympathetic to the Tamil Eelam cause and indoctrinate them with extreme LTTE ideology. They were to be trained in electronics and explosives. The ultimate objective was to infiltrate the island and conduct explosive attacks against key installations and important individuals in Sri Lanka. The project was being financed by Tiger elements in Europe. ??
Sri Lankan officials conveyed this information quietly to their counterparts in India. Great care was taken to avoid information leaking to pro-LTTE politicians and officials in Tamil Nadu. A team of Police officers from the Tamil Nadu State Police Special Intelligence Unit known as the ?Q? branch launched a sudden raid after nightfall on December 19, 2012 under the command of a Senior Deputy Superintendent of Police. A house on Nallathamby street in Pammal near the Chennai suburb of Pallaavaram was surrounded and stormed by a Police contingent. Four occupants in the rented residence were arrested. They were S. Suresh Kumar, D. Udaya Doss, T. Maheswaran and K. Krishnamurthy. At the time of their arrest in December 2012, they were aged 34, 39, 33 and 29 respectively. ??
According to a news report published then in the ?Times of India? an investigating officer said Suresh Kumar lost his legs in an explosion during the Eelam war and now moves around on a wheelchair. ?Two of the men came to Tamil Nadu as refugees in 2001 and 2003, and the others as the war was in its final stages in 2009,? the officer reportedly said. ??
?
LTTE electronics expert Suresh Kumar ??
The news report further said that as an electronics expert, Suresh Kumar headed an LTTE wing that made explosives. ?He specialised in making electronic circuits,? the officer said. ?We recovered two laptops, incriminating documents, wires, cables and electronic circuit boards and panels from the house.? Investigators said Krishnamurthy, who supplied water cans in the locality, befriended the Sri Lankan Tamils and took them to Suresh Kumar. The former LTTE operative trained them to make improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and electronic circuits for a variety of bombs. During questioning, the arrested men said. ??
The arrested men were produced before a Magistrate?s ?Court in Tambaram and were remanded in judicial custody. ??
With Sri Lankan security sleuths uncovering details of a ?Tamil Nadu Connection? in two different attempts to revive the LTTE in Sri Lanka there was much suspicion about the sinister motives of the Indian External Intelligence Agency the Research and Analysis Wing referred to as RAW. It was felt that RAW may have had a hand in these LTTE revival attempts. Against that backdrop, the threat posed was also over estimated. News reports appeared in Sri Lanka about training camps being conducted for hundreds of tigers in Tamil Nadu with the blessings of the RAW. These were stoutly denied. Continuing interaction between Sri Lankan and Indian officials put to rest the paranoia over RAW in Sri Lanka relating to this issue. ??
?
LTTE revival attempt in 2014 ??
Then came the LTTE revival attempt in 2014 spearheaded by a trio comprising Suntharalingam Gajatheeban alias Theiveegan, Navaratnam Navaneethan alias Appan and Ponniah Selvanayagam Kajeepan alias Gobi. This was the most serious well-organized effort to resurrect the LTTE in Sri Lanka after May 2009. This too was thwarted by the concerted efforts of the Police and Armed Forces. A crucial factor in this exercise was the close cooperation of State Intelligence, Military Intelligence and Police TID in combatting a common threat. This and other matters related to attempts by the Diaspora Tigers to foment violence in Sri Lanka would be related in detail in a forthcoming article.

NGOs cashing in on RTI for own agenda: MS
	
Certain NGOs in their haste to take advantage of the Right to Information (RTI) Act for their own agendas have applied for information on the assets declaration of the President and the Prime Minister soon after the RTI was enacted on February 3, President Maithripala Sirisena said yesterday.
He said the RTI envisioned the strengthening of the rule of law, ensuring good governance, democracy and transparency in state affairs and added that the Government introduced the RTI to eradicate corruption amid the people believing that 85% of public servants and 100% of the politicians were corrupt.
Delivering the keynote address at the ceremony held to mark the enactment of the RTI, the President said the law relating to the assets declaration by politicians and public servants was already in the statute book and any citizen could obtain information on the assets of a parliamentarian from the Speaker, by paying the relevant fee.
"Those seeking information under the RTI Act must be aware that they cannot obtain personal information of individuals and information relating to national security," he said adding that this information could be used for character assassination by unscrupulous individuals or groups.
He said information relating to public affairs, public expenditure and national development could be obtained.
?Our country is faced with indiscipline. Although we have the highest rate of literacy, the lack of discipline among the public, officials and politicians is a major setback in our forward march. Our people never do what should be done. This government was elected not to do what the previous government did. The people gave me a mandate with the hope that I will restore the rule of law, strengthen democracy and good governance,? the President said.
He said the people and the media enjoy the new found freedom under this government with certain groups taking to the streets, inconveniencing the public.
"A few people claiming to be disabled soldiers attempted to invade the Presidential Secretariat after removing their artificial limbs, demanding full pension benefits, though they had resigned from military service a few years after recruitment," the President said.
"The former prime minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike was severely harassed by the opposition. In the short period that he ruled the country, not a day passed without protests staged by the opposition. It is no different with the unity government. The media and the opposition are misusing the freedom restored by the unity government." (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Prices of 38 cataract lenses regulated
	
The prices of 38 brands of cataract lenses were regulated from midnight yesterday, the Health Ministry announced.
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said the price regulation would help reduce the prices charged for cataract surgeries and the malpractices would also be eliminated to a large extent.
He said cataract lenses would be provided by the Health Ministry free-of-charge through hospitals countrywide and added that the ministry had imported 100,000 cataract lenses even though only 89,000 cataract surgeries were conducted each year.
The minister told a news conference that the price regulation was done after consulting the eye surgeons and that the CIF value of the lenses was obtained from the Customs Department.
?The price regulation was implemented after discussions with the companies and the eye surgeons. We hope to reduce prices of more surgical equipment in the future,? he said.
The National Medicinal Regulatory Authority (NMRA) Chairman Asitha de Silva said cataract lenses that would not come under the price regulation were available in the market so that people could purchase their special requirements, which includes lenses used for special donation programmes and special lenses used under medical advice.
Ophthalmologist Charith Fonseka requested the various organizations that donate cataract lenses to use good quality lenses for patients.(Ajith Siriwardana)

Russian Ambassador speaks up for SAITM
	
In the wake of heated arguments over degree-awarding private medical colleges, Russian Ambassador Alexander Karchava defended the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM), saying it was being provided professorship by a leading medical academy in Russia .
He said bi-lateral cooperation in the education sector was also being promoted by the private sector bringing the two countries even closer.
The Ambassador said the Nizhni Novgorod State Medical Academy (NNSMA) was one of the most respected medical universities in Russia and worldwide providing professorship for SAITM.
?The Academy?s Dean Boris E. Shakhov has continuously expressed his satisfaction with the level of training of Sri Lankan students and honours cooperation with SAITM. There is no doubt that SAITM and the university team contribute greatly to the formation of Sri Lankan professional healthcare. SAITM and Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital of Sri Lanka and NNSMA of Russia provide an indispensable link in medical studies by combining fundamental basic knowledge with hands-on experience to help patients. In 2016, 54 Russian doctors and professors worked at SAITM, on a shift basis. By taking advantage of long-standing educational ties with Russia and its internationally recognized tradition of quality medical education, SAITM brings within its walls, not only internationally renowned experience but Russian medical practitioners themselves,? he said.

SC dismisses FR petition against PM's request to Speaker
	
The Supreme Court yesterday upheld the preliminary objections raised by the Attorney General and the Counsel appearing for the Prime Minister on the maintainability of the rights petition challenging the Prime Minister's request to the Speaker for a ruling on the SC pronouncement in the Singarasa Case.
The Bench comprising Justices Priyasath Dep, Upali Abeyratne and Anil Gooneratne dismissed without cost the petition filed by public litigation activist and lawyer Nagananda Kodituwakku.
The petitioner in his petition sought Court to rule that the statement made by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was wrong and that neither he, nor Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had the right to intervene in the judicial system of the country.
He said the Speaker exercises the legislative power in parliament on behalf of the people and he has nothing to do with the judicial system.
The petitioner said the Prime Minister's statement and the action proposed by him is in direct violation of the inalienable sovereign rights of the people, enshrined under Article 3 of the Constitution.
The Prime Minister told Parliament that the government re-confirms the continued validity and applicability of the Optional Protocol to the ICCPR and is firmly committed to implement its provisions. (S.S. Selvanayagam)

Steep fines through the 'Dog Law' amendment
	
The proposed amendment to the Dog Registration Ordinance will result in the mass killing of dogs, a consumer rights group said yesterday.
The President of the National Movement for Consumer Rights Protection, Ranjith Withanage said the proposed amendment which the government is hoping to introduce under which a person would be subjected to a fine of no less than Rs.25,000 if he or she dumps dogs in public places or lets the domestic dogs to go astray, would not be a healthy move as it would result in the killing of unwanted animals.
He said the government should make sure that the programme of sterilizing stray dogs was carried out effectively so that the stray-dog population can be controlled. ?If the proposed amendment is implemented, there will be large-scale killing of dogs, because people will resort to killing dogs to avoid paying fines,? Mr. Withanage said.
Meanwhile, Provincial Council and Local Government Minister Faizer Mustapha confirmed that he would submit a Cabinet paper on amending the Dog Registration Ordinance next week. ?The intention of the amendment is to stop people from dumping animals in public places and to make them more concerned about the animals,? he said.

Tamil Nadu CM Palaniswami wins trust vote
	
Edappadi Palaniswami, who was sworn-in as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu on Thursday, won the trust vote in the Assembly where 122 MLAs voted for him, while 11 voted for O Panneerselvam.
Majority needed was 68. This will pave way for him to continue on with the position. Palaniswami was administered the oath of office by Governor C Vidyasagar Rao after he submitted a letter on February 14 claiming he was elected as the Leader of the AIADMK Legislature party in a meeting of its MLAs that day.
Palaniswami, who belongs to VK Sasikala?s faction of the party, became the second party leader to become the chief minister of the state after the demise of J Jayalalithaa on December 5 last year. O Panneerselvam, who was immediately sworn-in as state CM after her demise, could not garner the much-needed support to win the floor test in the state Assembly.
Earlier, DMK and Congress supported the demand of a secret ballot by O Panneerselvam fraction. However, Speaker P Dhanapal rejected the demand. Leader of Opposition MK Stalin, who was allowed to speak ahead of the trust vote, said that the floor test should be postponed. The proceedings were delayed because a ruckus broke out in the Assembly.
The House was adjourned twice as protesting DMK MLAs heckled the speaker. Meanwhile, Stalin also alleged that he was manhandled as he spoke to the media wearing a torn shirt outside the Assembly. After the session resumed at 3 pm, the Congress MLAs staged a walkout from the Assembly. The session was resumed after DMK MLAs were expelled from the House.
Prior to this, the state witnessed a tussle between Panneerselvam and Sasikala over the post after former claimed that he was forced to resign from the position and was ready to withdraw his resignation if the public demanded. However, Sasikala?s conviction in a disproportionate assests case by the Supreme Court blocked her chances.
OPS, who had support of ten MLAs to begin with, claimed that he was was former CM jayalalithaa?s choice for the position. Palaniswami was given 15 days by the Governor to prove his majority in the House. (The Indian Express)

Time-tested bilateral relations between Sri  Lanka and Russia
	
?
The diplomatic relations between Russia and Sri Lanka were established on February 19, 1957, but their history goes long before the Sri Lankan Independence. We find first mentions of Ceylon in the memoirs of Russian merchant and traveller Afanasiy Nikitin as early as in the late 15th century. Later in the 18th century, several princes, scientists and geographers toured the island. The first idea of opening the Russian consulate in Sri Lanka appeared in 1858, but its first official representative was appointed only more than 30 years later and the Consulate was opened in Colombo. In 1891, Russian Crown Prince, future Emperor Nikolai II, visited Ceylon. The tree planted by the future emperor can be observed in the Peradeniya botanical gardens.?
The multifaceted history of Russian-Sri Lankan relationship was recited in detail in ?Sri Lanka-Soviet-Russia relations,? the recently-published book by Former Deputy General Secretary of the Sri Lankan-Soviet Friendship League Sirimanna Karunatillake. It will be useful for anyone interested in bilateral relations between the two countries. I also read with great pleasure a piece by Mr. Somar Wijedasa published in the Sunday Times on February 12, 2017, and I am very grateful to the author for his accurate recollection of many significant events from the rich history of our bilateral relations.?
Our long-lasting ties, fruitful and extensive exchanges in different spheres, despite the long geographical distance between the two countries, take roots in shared multicultural, multinational and multi-religious landscape. Bilateral relations between Russia and Sri Lanka in the political sphere can be defined as excellent: Russia, from the very inception, expressed understanding of the Sri Lankan Government struggle against terrorism, and supported Colombo in all international fora in its fight against foreign interferences in internal affairs. As did Sri Lanka and we value this support very much.?
Bolstering political and cultural cooperation?
Lately, the bilateral contacts between our two countries picked up a good pace. Moreover, it gives me an immense pleasure to highlight that Sri Lankan interest and commitment to the activities of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) as a dialogue partner is highly appreciated. In 2015, Deputy Justice Minister Sarathi Dushmantha Mithrapala travelled to Moscow to take part in the legal forum organised under the auspices of SCO.?
Later that year, the delegation from the Russian Upper Chamber of Parliament, Federal Council of Federal Assembly of the Russian ?Federation, headed by the Deputy Speaker of Federal Council Iliyas Umakhanov, visited Sri ?Lanka. Mr. Umakhanov conducted substantial talks with Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and members of the Sri Lankan-Russian parliamentary group of friendship. He also held meetings with Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera and Sri Lankan Board of Investment (BOI) Chairman Upul Jayasuriya.?
Also, in the course of the last three years, we managed to ink several bilateral agreements on cooperation in nuclear area, visa-free journeys for holders of diplomatic and service passports and on cooperation in mass communications.?
Russia and Sri ?Lanka have always valued the importance of education for empowering the future generations. Since 1960s, more than 800 Sri Lankans graduated from the People?s Friendship ?University in Moscow and overall around 3,000 obtained their degrees in various universities in Russia and CIS. Thanks to the efforts of the Russian Cultural Centre in Colombo we expand every year the educational opportunities for Sri Lankans by increasing the number of scholarships.?
Bilateral cooperation in education is also promoted by the private sector, which only brings our countries closer. The Nizhni Novgorod State Medical Academy (NNSMA), one of the most respected medical universities in Russia and around the world, has been providing professorship for the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) for some time. The Academy?s Dean Boris E. Shakhov has continuously expressed his satisfaction with the level of training Sri Lankan students and honours cooperation with SAITM. There is no doubt that SAITM and the university team contribute greatly to the formation of Sri Lankan professional healthcare. SAITM and the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (Hospital of Sri Lanka-Russia friendship) provide indispensable link in medical studies: they combine fundamental base knowledge with hands-on experience while also helping patients. In 2016, some 54 Russian doctors and professors worked in SAITM in shifts. By taking advantage of long-standing educational ties with Russia and its internationally-recognised tradition of quality medical education, SAITM brings to its walls not only internationally-renowned experience but the Russian practitioners themselves.?
New era of bilateral economic cooperation?
Even though bilateral economic relations fall behind the political cooperation, the year 2016 marked the beginning of a new economic era in commercial relations between Russia and Sri Lanka. In February 2016, the first meeting of the Intergovernmental Commission on Trade, Economic, Scientific and Technological Cooperation took place in Moscow. The Sri Lankan delegation led by then Industry and Commerce Ministry Secretary T.M.B.K Tennekoon met with Russian Deputy Agriculture Minister and Head of the Fisheries Agency Iliya Shestakov.?
Better prospects ?
This anniversary year is expected to be quite dynamic in terms of political exchanges between Russia and Sri Lanka. The great milestone will be the official visit of President Maithripala Sirisena to Moscow. We are working very closely with our colleagues from the Sri Lankan Foreign Affairs Ministry to substantially beef up this visit. We expect to sign some crucial agreements that will bring Russian-Sri Lankan bilateral relations to a new level. It is a significant event because as far as I recall, it is going to be the first official visit of the Sri Lankan Head of State to Russia in decades.?
As far as parliamentary interaction is concerned, the year will be marked by the visit of the Sri Lankan parliamentary delegation to Russia, headed by the Speaker himself, which we hope will boost the exchanges between our legislative bodies.?
The time-tested nature of the friendly Russia?Sri Lanka links gives me all reasons to say there is a wide and open road for the continuous development of our bilateral political contacts, highly-beneficial cooperation in the trade, economic, educational and cultural spheres. I have not any doubt in the bright perspectives for the sustainable and large-scale development of the relations between our two countries.?
Long live Sri Lankan-Russian friendship!?

Venezuelan court upholds sentence against opposition leader
	
?
CARACAS, Venezuela (AP/Daily Mail)16 February 2017 - Venezuela?s highest court has upheld a 14-year prison sentence for opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez, ruling a day after U.S. President Donald Trump called for his release after meeting with Lopez?s wife. ?
Lopez was found guilty of inciting violence during a wave of deadly anti-government protests in 2014, a conviction that many foreign governments see as politically motivated. ?
Thursday?s ruling makes the conviction final. ? A day earlier Trump tweeted a photo of himself with Lopez?s wife, Lilian Tintori, demanding that the opposition leader be let out ?immediately.? ?
Venezuelan Foreign Minister Delcy Rodriguez accused Trump of committing an ?aggression? against Venezuela. ? The development comes during a turbulent week for U.S.-Venezuela relations. The U.S. announced sanctions against Venezuela?s vice president Monday, accusing him of playing a major role in international drug trafficking. ?
