The National Zoological Garden said it was looking out for a female dog with puppies of two or three days old to feed three lion cubs that were born this morning.
Assistant Director Anoma Priyardarshani said the lioness had avoided feeding the cubs since they were born.
We were waiting for the lioness to feed the cubs till this evening. But she rejected feeding them. We decided to feed them with specially imported milk powder meant for lions. But they need to be fed by an animal so that they could get the required immunization, she said.
Ms. Priyadarshani said the lioness, Sachina aged four years, had rejected her cub on an earlier occasion as well.Pix by H.M.Dharmapala

Next election only after electoral reforms: UPFA
	
The United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) today emphasised that the general election would be held under the new electoral system despite the time it would take to have them approved under the 20th Amendment to the Constitution.

UPFA General Secretary Susuil Premajayantha told the media that the UPFA stance on introducing the 19th and the 20th Amendments were enacted simultanously.
The people want to do away with the much-despised preferential voting system that had infected the political and electoral environment with many ills. We expect to pass the 20th Amendment soon after the 19th Amendment is passed in parliament shortly.
I dont think there are any impediments that obstruct the passage of the 19th Amendment which will be debated on Monday because we command the support of 136 MPs and the United National Party (UNP) 49, he said but did not confirm whether the 19th Amendment would be put to the vote on Tuesday as announced by the government.
Mr. Premajayantha said the new parliament to be elected under the new electoral system will comprise 255 members -- 165 members including those returned from multi party constituencies will be elected under the first past the post, 66 under the district proportional system and 24 on the national list.
The UPFA will submit a concept paper on the 20th Amendment shortly based on the formula prepared by Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya. All party leaders have basically expressed their support to it. Mr. Deshapriya is of the view that only a few months are needed to conclude the delimitation process. The most important aspect is that this formula has addressed the concerns of minor political parties and minority representation, he said. 
Mr. Premajayantha said if the UPFA and the UNP agree to the proposed amendments to the electoral system then the 20th Amendment could be passed in less than three months to be followed by a general election.
We need a genuine desire sans personal agendas to introduce the electoral reforms and a consensus between the UPFA and the UNP on the 20th Amendment. We will make sure that general elections will not be held as long as the 19th and the 20th Amendments have been enacted. The electoral reforms on local government polls have already been approved by parliament. It will become law after it is gazetted, he said.(Sandun A. Jayasekera)

## Title: Opposition wants 19A redrafted

Opposition wants 19A redrafted
	
Opposition leader Nimal Siripala de Silva said today the proposed 19th Amendment must be redrafted to keeping with the Supreme Court determination, re-gazetted and the Supreme Court approval obtained before presenting it in Parliament.

He said this was a pre-requisite if opposition support was necessary for the passage of the 19A in Parliament.

Mr. de Silva said the government distributed a draft of the proposed 19th Amendment in English. It appeared to have been prepared haphazardly and the opposition refused to accept.

He said the opposition wants a properly drafted 19th Amendment in line with the Supreme Court ruling if the government wants the support of the opposition.

Mr. de Silva said government was lagging behind in 100-day programme and charged that the government was carrying out a misinformation campaign that the UPFA was against the 19th Amendment and the protests in parliament were aimed at preventing the 19th Amendment being debated and not to protect the interests of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa.

He told a news conference that the UPFA was agreeable to re-activating the independent commissions, clipping the absolute powers of the executive presidency and introducing electoral reforms.

Unfortunately what has happened is an attempt by the government to hoodwink the opposition and surreptitiously incorporate certain clauses in the 19th Amendment to create the post of executive prime minister. We opposed these attempts. Our position is that the 19th Amendment must be drafted in line with the Supreme Court determination. Only then can we support it, Mr. De Silva said.

I am sad to say that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has done something that has never happened in our parliament before. He attempted to present a 36-page Bill through the Attorney General weakening the presidency and strengthening the prime minister. We opposed that covertly act and not to the 19th Amendment. The opposition will not support the 19th Amendment until the government redrafted and gazetted it and obtained SC approval.(Sandun A. Jayasekera)

Video: Portfolios pointless if 19A not passed: Dy. Minister
	
It is pointless for ministers to hold on to their portfolios after April 28 if the 19th Amendment is not enacted by then, a deputy minister said today.
Deputy Foreign Minister Ajith P. Perera told a media briefing that the government should call it quits and parliament must be dissolved if the 19th Amendment was not enacted but he sounded optimistic about getting the legislation passed next Tuesday with President Maithripala Sirisena assuring that he would obtain the sufficient numbers for the passage of the 19th Amendment in parliament.
Referring to the move by the Bribery Commission to question former President Mahinda Rajapaksa the deputy minister said this decision was taken solely by the Commission.

Government had never wanted to order such a probe because such a move was politically not advisable at this moment. If this move had political connotation then it should have been carried out much earlier or put off for later, he said.

The deputy minister and Uva Chief Minister Harin Fernando who responded to a statement made by the former President that he did not penalize wrongdoers during his tenure said Mr. Rajapaksa should then name those wrongdoers.
It may have been these wrongdoers who made a din in parliament, Mr. Fernando said.(Yohan Perera and Darshana Sanjeewa)WATCH

MR as PM in Sirisena Govt will boost SL : Gotabaya
	
	Sri Lankas once powerful Defence Secretary, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, wants President Maithripala Sirisena and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to join hands to give the island nation a functioning government and lift it from the abyss of political confusion and economic stagnation. 
	Maithripala Sirisena has been elected President for six years. Therefore, he will have to continue. But he can quickly call for parliamentary elections and appoint Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister. Together, they should put the country back on its feet by providing a functioning government with people committed to achieving goals, Gotabaya told Express in an exclusive interview on Tuesday.
	A sibling of Mahinda Rajapaksa, Gotabaya claimed that Sri Lankans want Rajapaksa back. Support for him has grown beyond the 5.8 million votes he got in the January Presidential election, he said.
	Sri Lankans are clueless as to who is in charge of their country, Gotabaya observed.
	On the one hand there is Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who is running the government. But on the other hand, Chandrika Kumaratunga, Champika Ranawaka and Rajitha Senaratne also claim to be in-charge. However, what is clear to the people is that there is no functioning government. All economic development projects initiated by the Rajapaksa government have been brought to a standstil. In the construction sector alone, over 100,000 workers have been rendered jobless by the stoppage of projects, he pointed out.
	Because officials are being hauled up before investigative agencies for alleged procedural lapses, no civil servant wants to take decisions. If this situation is allowed to continue, the entire economy will collapse and it will be difficult to put it back on its feet, he warned.
	Gotabaya, who has been asked to appear before the Bribery Commission later this month, dismissed the charges against him as being baseless. I have been accused of procedural lapses. Have I robbed money In fact, I have earned money, including foreign exchange, for the government through my projects, he asserted.
	On the alleged illegal activities of the floating armory set up by a company wholly owned by the Ministry of Defence, Gotabaya said that it was engaged in anti-piracy work in the Somalian waters as per a UN request.
	It was an international obligation Lanka had to fulfil. And the company was earning foreign exchange for the country. It had also been held up as a model by an international maritime security body based in UK, he said.
	The former Secretary for Defence and Urban Development said that he had not only won the war against the Tamil Tigers but had given a new face to Colombo, both not done by previous regimes. The present government is after me for delivering results. Sarath Fonseka claimed in India that he won the war. But I say, he was in the army for 30 years, but had failed to win the war. It was only when we (the Rajapaksa brothers) took over, that the war was finished, and that too, in three years flat. Chandrika Kumaratunga claims that she had won 75 per cent of the war, but it was during her Presidency that there were major reverses, Gotabaya recalled.
	The Lankan government on Tuesday gave into the Oppositions agitation demanding that ex-President Mahinda Rajapaksa should not be summoned by the Bribery Commission. Wijedasa Rajapaksa, minister for justice, told parliament that a commission officer will visit Rajapaksas house and take a statement from him instead. The Oppositions position is that Rajapaksa could not be taken to court or be questioned for an action he took as President as the President enjoys immunity for his official acts. Rajapaksa had appointed a defector from the Opposition as a cabinet minister during the last Presidential poll campaign. This was deemed as corruption.(Indian Express)

We have had no dealings with Wele Suda: Artistes
	
A group of artistes today urged the Police to reveal the details of any allegations if there were any made by Samantha Kumara alias Wele Suda against artistes instead of leaving room for speculation and an excuse for gossip mongers to defame them.
Actress Semini Iddamalgoda said according to unofficial reports an artiste had been questioned by the police over alleged dealings with Wele Suda. She rejected any reports of any such involvement by her or actress Lochana Imashi. 
We found that a person named Madushanaka Ganegoda had posted the baseless news item on social network sites. However, he had rectified the news item later but the damage was already done, she said.
Earlier, reports posted on social network sites by certain individuals had indicated that about six actresses including Semini and Lochana had dealings with Wele Suda.
Ms. Iddamalgoda said she had complained to the CID against the person who had allegedly created the fabricated story but that she hadnt received a reply so far. She said Police Spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara had informed them the offense did not come under the purview of the CID and asked us to file a lawsuit against the miscreants for defamation.
I have had bitter experiences, when it comes to lawsuits and I know how long a case can drag on until the final verdict. Therefore I wont go to courts but urge the Police Chief to look into the matter, Ms. Iddamalgoda said. 
Actress Lochana Imashi, who is about to be married soon, said she was deeply troubled by the news reports and categorically denied the allegations as false and fabricated. (Lahiru Pothmulla)Pix by Kithsiri de Mel
