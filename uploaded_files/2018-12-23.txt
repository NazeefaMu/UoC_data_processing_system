Tsunami death toll rises to 168 in Indonesia
	
At least 168 people have been killed and 745 injured after a tsunami hit coastal towns on Indonesia's Sunda Strait, government officials say.
The tsunami waves struck at night without any warning, destroying hundreds of buildings.
Officials say the tsunami could have been caused by undersea landslides after Anak Krakatau volcano erupted.
The Sunda Strait, between the islands of Java and Sumatra, connects the Java Sea to the Indian Ocean.
The disaster management agency has warned people to stay away from the coastline due to fears of another tsunami.
Saturday's tsunami struck at about 21:30 local time (14:30GMT), hitting several beaches including the popular Tanjung Lesung beach resort in the west of Java island.
Deaths have been reported in the Pandeglang and Serang on Java, and Lampung province on Sumatra. Officials fear the death toll could rise further.(BBC)
