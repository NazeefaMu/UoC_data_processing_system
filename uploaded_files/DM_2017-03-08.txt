Will Comeys request push Trump  over the edge
	

By Jennifer Rubin 
(c) 2017, The Washington Post  Mar 07, 2017 
WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump was mad - steaming, raging mad, The Washington Post reports. No one was defending his harebrained assertion that President Barack Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower. How dare they not defend the indefensible! No Republican seemed to see his allegation as credible or vouch for it on the Sunday talk shows. Mark Warner, Va., the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and a bevy of conservative commentators set out to debunk Trumps latest lunacy. Then along came former director of national intelligence James Clapper, who said straight out that nothing of the sort had occurred. 
And all that -- a weekend of Trump tantrums -- came before what is possibly the most stinging and embarrassing rebuke to date of the beleaguered president. The Post reports: 
FBI Director James B. Comey asked the Justice Department this weekend to issue a statement refuting President Trumps claim that President Barack Obama ordered a wiretap of Trumps phones before the election, according to U.S. officials, but the department did not do so. 
Comey made the request Saturday after Trump accused Obama on Twitter of having his  wires tapped in Trump Tower. The White House expanded on Trumps comments Sunday with a call for a congressional probe of his allegations. . . . 
It is not clear why Comey, who is the senior-most law enforcement officer who has been overseeing the FBI investigation from its inception in the Obama administration, did not himself issue a statement to refute Trumps claims. Nor is it clear to whom he made his request. Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself last week from all investigative matters related to the Trump campaign and any potential Russia links. The acting deputy attorney general, Dana Boente, a career federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia, is now overseeing the probe. 
To recap: The president wants congressional committees to look into his own baseless allegation while his FBI director wants the Justice Department to declare that this is hogwash. 
Comeys extraordinary request underscores the degree to which the chief executive really is not leading the executive branch (including the intelligence community) in a meaningful way. Trumps compulsion to destroy any source of damaging facts has propelled him into a war with the responsible media, with critics, with the previous administration and with the intelligence community.
They all represent a threat to his ego, to his desire to be the sole source of information that can excuse away his aberrant behavior and rhetoric. He demeans, slanders and denigrates his own intelligence community; no doubt infuriated with his prevaricating and attacks on their integrity, leakers (whether in the White House, the bureaucracy or the intelligence community) retaliate by exposing his falsehoods. 
The episode also highlights how emotionally out of control Trump is. He lashes out with tweets, rails at aides and vilifies the media. This is not a rational person exercising good judgment. The effect on morale in the executive branch, Congress and Republicans more generally is profound. For our allies, it is terrifying. It is sending a terrible message out there, said former CIA director and defense secretary Leon Panetta. I can tell you, based on my own conversations with people abroad, that they are very concerned about the administration, about the president. They are concerned about whether he truly is going to be committed to the kind of world leadership that we have seen the United States provide. He added that every time these things happen, every time he tweets, every time these issues come up that indicate that -- you know, theres obviously something to this Russian issue, and the administration is not cooperating, when that happens, when he accuses a past president of wiretapping, without any evidence of that being the case, it makes us vulnerable. 
And finally, we can see that Comey and Republican senators increasingly go their own way and refuse to rationalize or condone Trumps rants. Trump becomes incensed when they wont play along, but why should they Comey, after his ill-timed intrusions into the 2016 election with missives about Hillary Clintons emails, is now struggling for career redemption. Senate Republicans are fighting to keep their agenda on track and keep their party from devolving into a mob of fabulists, conspiratorialists and crackpots. Sure, Trump has plenty of yes men and enablers in Congress, but even they are not going to follow him over the brink.

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said yesterday he would inform the decision regarding the request made by Joint Opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa of the Jathika Nidahas Peramuna (JNP) to function independently in parliament today.
He said he was taking up the matter with the party leaders meeting yesterday.
"I will discuss the matter with party leaders today and inform parliament tomorrow," he said.
The speaker said he would request the opinion of the UPFA to arrive at a decision.
MP Weerawansa asked the Speaker not to act on the opinion of the UPFA.
Referring to the matter, Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said the letter sent by MP Weerawansa to remove from UPFA was not clear.
He said Mr. Weerawansa had mentioned in the letter that his group wanted to be removed from the UPFA but such a group had not contested from the UPFA and requested them to inform him individually whether they wanted to do so.
"The JNP is not a party in the UPFA. We do not have an agreement with them. If they really want to leave the UPFA, inform individually. Then I will reply immediately. We do not want to keep them by force," he said. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Womens Economic Empowerment in the Changing World of Work
	
International Womens Day is an opportunity to celebrate the economic, political and social achievements of women. These achievements are plentiful. Across the world, more women and girls than ever before serve in political office, live under constitutions guaranteeing gender equality, and are protected by laws against gender-based violence. 

But International Womens Day is also a time to recommit ourselves to tackling the barriers to full gender equality that persist - barriers that exist in all of our countries to different extents. 
The priority theme of the 61st session on the Commission on the Status of Women later this month is Womens Economic Empowerment in the Changing World of Work. 
Globally, women continue to earn less than men; are more likely to work in low-skilled jobs; have less assets; and are more likely to be burdened with an unfair proportion of unpaid work, family and household responsibilities.These and other factors exclude women from making critical financial decisions at household, local, national and international levels. 
Yet gender inequality has an adverse impact on economic growth. So investing in womens economic empowerment is both the right and smart thing to do. According to the McKinsey Global Institute, advancing gender equality could lead to US$28 trillion a year in global growth.And when you consider that women typically invest 90 per cent of their income back into their families and their welfare, the social development impact of promoting gender equality is significant.

The Australian Government recognises that womens economic empowerment is a significant driver of economic growth and prosperity. This is why promoting womens economic empowerment is a core priority for us, integrated across Australias foreign policy advocacy, trade negotiations, economic diplomacy and aid investments. 
Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has also stressed the importance of engaging with the private sector in all aspects of delivery of Australian aid. This is because the private sector is a driver of growth, of incomes and jobs.The challenge is to ensure that the growth is inclusive and creates opportunities for all. 
During the last year, we have worked on a range of programmes to deliver on this agenda. The Monash University Business School has partnered with the Sri Lanka Institute of Development Administration to produce a toolkit for women entrepreneurs to enable them to write their own business and development plans. The University of Adelaide has collaborated with the Womens Media Collective and other civil society representatives to quantify the financial contribution of unpaid work to the formal economy. We have supported the development of the Women Headed Household Action Plan and implemented a range of activities to support the new quota for women in local government. 
In 2017, Australia will launch three new initiatives that focus on helping Sri Lanka to capture more income and revenue every year from the inclusion of more people, especially women and youth, in the formal economy. The Skills for Inclusive Growth programme will deliver targeted skills development to support job creation and business growth in the tourism sector. Australias Market Development Facility will support small and medium businesses to expand in a way that provides more job opportunities for all, including women. 
Our Women in Business programme will aim to provide more quality job opportunities for women and support the growth of female-owned businesses. We will work with lead firms to remove barriers to womens workforce participation, support women in leadership programs, identify opportunities to link female-owned businesses in value chains, and increase access to finance and consumer protection. These programmes will all contribute to Prime Minister Wickremesinghes target of increasing womens workforce participation to 40 per cent by 2020. 
During the last year, I have met with a wide range of womens organisations and women leaders from across the island. I have been humbled by the passion, enthusiasm and commitment of these women in promoting gender equality. But it is important that more men, especially those in positions of power and influence, help advance this work. 
Men need to stand together with women to say that gender equality is everyones business.In Australia we have an initiative known as Male Champions of Change. This initiative engages men to ensure that gender equality is better understood and to find new ways to bring about change, especially attitudinal change. 
On International Womens Day, I encourage all of us to recommit to promoting gender equality. It is both the right and the smart thing to do. It is also vital for realising our shared hopes for a prosperous and sustainable future for our region.

Sri Lanka became a signatory of this Convention in December 10, 2015.
The Bill was presented to Parliament by Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella last afternoon.
The Bill seeks to ensure the right to Justice and reparation for victims of enforced disappearances.

Bullies  and their victims
	


Q How can bullying affect a childs self esteem and integration in society 
In bullying there is an imbalance of power, a sense of helplessness and sometimes a feeling of inescapability. Some children refuse to go to school when they are victims of bullying. Studies suggest that there is a relationship between a victims perception of control over their bullying experience and the extent of long-term difficulties. Those who can control the situation better have more beneficial long term outcomes than those who feel a sense of helplessness. This indicates that the emotional harm of bullying may be far greater than the physical. 
While bullying certainly does affect self-esteem, the problems go beyond that. Bullying can predispose vulnerable individuals to a host of issues including anxiety and depression. Again, this can be considered chronic stress on the childs developing brain, and can even alter how they react to situations later in life, thus even impacting their personality formation. 
The consequences of bullying can also affect the way one interacts with peers and may lead to isolation within peer groups. The negative templates of these interactions can in turn, influence the way these children interact and perceive themselves when they are adults. 
Q Why do certain children reflect characteristics of a bully and why do some kids become the subject of bullying especially in school 
Studies show that boys generally tend to bully more than girls. While boys tend to have a more physical aspect to bullying, with newer forms of bullying using electronic and social media, gender differences are less clear. 
It has also been found that those who bully are more likely to have conflicts at home and perceive school negatively. They have also been found to consistently perform poorly at academics. 
A victim meanwhile, is more likely to lack social and problem-solving skills and be already isolated or rejected by peers. It appears that those with these types of characteristics are more likely to gain the attention of bullies. There is also evidence to show that a proportion of victims of bullying are likely to end up bullying others later on. However, these stereotypes do tend to change. 
Because some children might not admit overtly that they were bullied, being sensitive to how your child acts and feels and generally knowing what is taking place in their lives is central to being able to help. 
It is also generally understood that having a network of supportive family members and friends reduces the impact of being bullied. Having someone to confide in, receive advice on solving social problems and having someone for support are all important. This in turn reduces the sense of helplessness they may otherwise feel. 
As parents, it is also important to teach children how to deal with difficult social situations and provide them with opportunities to learn social skills. These skills are likely to be as important as any academic skill that we give so much attention to.

## Title: Dealing with Thalassaemia

Dealing with Thalassaemia
	

With no permanent cure except for bone marrow transplant, which is available only to a minority of patients, and lifelong treatment in terms of regular blood transfusions for others, Thalassaemia is recognized as a significant health challenge to many in todays context. Thalassaemia is the most commonly inherited disorder in Sri Lanka. Statistically, there are roughly about 60 new patients with Thalassaemia major also known as Transfusion Dependent Thalassaemia, being born every year in Sri Lanka. In a candid interview with Health Capsule, Senior Lecturer and Head of the Department of Pathology and Honorary Consultant Haematologist at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo Dr. Lallindra Gooneratne and Lecturer at the Department of Paediatrics at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo and Honorary Consultant Pediatrician at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children, Colombo Dr. Ruwangi Dissanayake explained the nature of Thalassaemia in depth, while elucidating on the symptoms, diagnosis and treatment related to the disease. 
Definition
Thalassaemia is an inherited disorder of haemoglobin synthesis, which gives rise to anaemia in a patient. In the case of Thalassaemia, there are carriers of the disease who dont have any symptoms or clinical effects. However, they carry the gene. Usually, patients who are symptomatic are those who have inherited the abnormal gene from their parents. Such patients could be either Homozygous or Compound Heterozygous. Homozygous refers to the same genetic disorder in both parents. Thus, the child will have a genetic disorder inherited from both parents. Comparatively, Compound Heterozygous refers to an instance where the patient is diagnosed with an abnormal gene from the mother and another abnormal gene from the father, but these two genetic defects are not the same kind of disorder, explains Dr. Lallindra Gooneratne. 
There are about four common types of genetic defects found in Sri Lanka among the hundreds of genetic defects that could cause Thalassaemia. Roughly about 2,500-3,000 patients in Sri Lanka currently diagnosed with Transfusion Dependent Thalassaemia are in need of regular blood transfusions. It should also be noted that Haemoglobin has two components. One is heme and the other is known as globin. Globin is a type of protein. These proteins are of two types; namely beta globins and alpha globins. The decrease in the number of beta globins is known as Beta Thalassaemia and the decrease noticed in the alpha globins gives rise to Alpha Thalassaemia, he added. 
Symptoms
Speaking to Health Capsule, Dr. Ruwangi Dissanayake said the disease usually starts during infancy. The symptoms present themselves when the infant is about six-months-old. They will show symptoms of lethargy, poor feeding and slow growth rate. We will also examine such babies for certain clinical features such as being pale, anaemic and distension of the abdomen; caused due to the enlargement of internal organs as part of anaemia. This is a defect of the synthesis of haemoglobin. We will conduct certain examinations to confirm the disease she said. 
According to Dr. Dissanayake, the most common form of Thalassaemia dealt with in Sri Lanka is Beta Thalassaemia Major but other forms of Thalassaemia such as E Beta Thalassaemia and Thalassaemia Intermedia also exist.
Cases of Alpha Thalassaemia are also common in Sri Lanka but there arent many patients who are symptomatic of Alpha Thalassaemia. However, this completely depends on the genetic makeup of the patient. The bulk of our patients is Beta Thalassaemia Major and a certain percentage of E Beta Thalassaemia Dr. Dissanayake said. 

Diagnosis
Patients who are dependent on blood transfusions are diagnosed at a young age; mostly by the age of six months. When symptoms of paleness and inactivity are evident in the baby, parents bring their child for a medical checkup. A blood count is conducted to check if the haemoglobin is low, and if the blood count indicates that the red blood cells are smaller than usual, this could lead the Paediatrician to a fair suspicion along with other clinical presentations, that the child might be diagnosed with Thalassaemia. Dr. Gooneratne said if the Peadiatrician suspected that the patient had Thalassaemia, a blood test would also be conducted to indicate that the patient was diagnosed with the disease. These procedures will be ensued by a test named Haemoglobin HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography). 
Swelling of the spleen and liver are symptoms related to the diagnosis of Thalassaemia. Such swellings occur when red blood cells are not produced properly in the bone marrow due to a defect in the haemoglobin.
Therefore, the amounts of blood cells which are required for the body are not produced adequately or effectively by the bone marrow. Thus, blood cells will be produced in the liver and the spleen. This is one reason why the liver and the spleen become enlarged. The liver and the spleen produce blood cells in the foetus but when the child is born and grows older, blood cells are produced in the bone marrow instead of being produced in the liver and spleen.
When the blood cells are not adequately produced in the bone marrow, the liver and spleen takes over the job of producing blood cells again. This function gives rise to the enlargement of the liver and spleen Dr. Gooneratne explained. 
Health complications of Thalassaemia
In the case of Thalassaemia, we are mainly dealing with the red blood cells or the haemoglobin. If a patient becomes very anaemic and has not been diagnosed early enough, this may give rise to severe health complications such as heart failure. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, we start treating the patient. Early treatment is also a means of preventing the rise of further health complications in the patient. Thalassaemia is a lifelong disease that requires treatment; especially in transfusion-dependent patients. Such patients will have blood transfusions regularly Dr. Dissanayake said. 
Iron overload is another health complication that arises due to regular blood transfusions. Growth in terms of height and puberty also can be affected as a result of the health complications arising due to Thalassaemia. A whole lot of hormonal issues such as diabetes, hypothyroidism and issues with calcium could also rise as other complications. 
Treatment
Stating that only certain patients can be fully cured by bone marrow transplant, Dr. Gooneratne said that patients cannot be cured with medication. Almost every month since the day the patient turns six months old, blood transfusions will have to be given regularly for the patient. Accordingly, such patients will require blood transfusions throughout their entire life. 
Giving blood transfusions is the only type of treatment available. However, when these patients are given blood transfusions, they tend to accumulate iron in them. One of the major problems why Thalassaemia patients become ill and die is because of the overload of iron accumulated in the body. Therefore, together with giving monthly blood transfusions, we should also give special medication to remove iron from the body Dr. Gooneratne said.
Such patients will be on regular blood transfusions and after about the tenth transfusion, there will be a risk of iron accumulation in the body. Iron overload is something that is invariably going to happen. We expect the iron accumulation to happen between the tenth and twentieth blood transfusion.
Therefore, patients will be tested to affirm iron accumulation in the body following the tenth transfusion. This is the treatment administered mainly to patients diagnosed with Beta Thalassaemia Major. Earlier, the medicine that was largely available was injections but now oral medicines are also available for treatment. The treatment options are usually discussed with the patient before starting on medication. 
Iron overload could affect a patient because the iron can get deposited in the organs. For example, most of the endocrine organs which are hormone stimulating organs such as the pancreas and the thyroid can be affected. This could also affect two main organs such as the heart and liver. If such complications arise in a patient, he or she may eventually die due to iron overload unless treated early Dr. Dissanayake explained. 
Dr. Gooneratne said bone marrow transplant is at present the only curative option available to cure a patient completely. Other modes are currently on trial. For the first time in Sri Lanka, a bone marrow transplant was conducted in 2014. In 2014, the first transplant unit in Sri Lanka was established at the Asiri Central Hospital with patients who have been completely cured. However, he warned that the surgery does not work with every patient hundred percent successfully. 
Explaining how bone marrow transplantation is conducted, he said that very strong chemotherapy will have to be administered to destroy all the bone marrow of the patient since the defect is in the genes evident in the blood cells of the patients bone marrow. After killing all the bone marrow, a donors (usually a sibling of the patient who is matched genetically) bone marrow is used for transplant by way of an infusion very similar to a blood transfusion. Once the donors bone marrow is deposited in the patients destroyed bone marrow, it starts growing anew and producing red blood cells that are genetically similar to the donor. In a successful bone marrow transplant, the blood group of the patient will convert to the blood group of the donor he said. 
Screening and Awareness
Screening tests are available in the country and everyone is encouraged to get themselves screened. The National Thalassaemia Prevention Programme spearheaded by the Ministry of Health is very effective in raising awareness on Thalassaemia. The issue of medication against iron accumulation for free of charge. Except for the bone marrow transplant which is currently not available in the government sector, the blood transfusion and medication are given free to patients under the National Thalassaemia Prevention Programme. 
Since we are targeting prevention, screening is targeted mainly for healthy people, where they are encouraged to get a blood test done. If both partners are carriers, we discourage them to have children. This is the only prevention available. If two carriers get married there is a chance that they may have children with Thalassaemia Major. That is why we prevention is so important. If the screening tests reveal that one parent is a carrier while the other is not, then it indicates that a child they have in future might have a fifty percent chance of becoming a carrier too. The difference between a carrier and a patient is that a carrier carries but does not manifest the disease, whereas the disease is manifested in a patient Dr. Gooneratne said. Awareness programmes are being conducted in all centres of the programme to promote prevention and better health education.

Dinesh suspended from Parliament for a week
	
After a tense parliamentary session, Joint Oppositions parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardane was suspended from attending parliamentary sessions for one week following a vote in the House.
Parliament ran into turmoil after Speaker Karu Jayasuriya ruled that the National Freedom Front (NFF) of MP Wimal Weerawansa could not be recognised as a separate group in the House because the party contested the election only on the ticket of the UPFA.
Mr. Gunawardane rose on his feet against this ruling, leading to a tense situation in the House. Mr. Weerawansa, along with MP Padma Udayasantha Gunasekara, rushed in to the Well of the House against the Speakers announcement.
The Speaker ordered them to return to their seats, but tension persisted compelling him to suspend sittings. Though the House resumed business again, tension broke out. Mr. Gunawardane and others started demonstrating against the decision. Eventually, the Speaker, in conformity with powers vested with him under Standing Order 74(I), ordered Mr. Gunawardane to leave the House. At this moment, he suspended the sittings for the second time, and for the first time, he called on the police and the Sergeant-at-Arms to remove Mr. Gunawardane.
There was turmoil in the House as Ministers Sarath Amunugama and others were seen confronting Mr Gunawardane.
When the House resumed business for the third time, the Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella moved a motion to suspend Mr. Gunawardane. The motion was passed with 85 votes to 22.

Driverless car 'Sedric' acts as your personal robot
	
For families who struggle to tear their children away from the TV in the morning, this could be the answer.
A driverless car described as a 'comfortable lounge on wheels' has been unveiled by Volkswagen  with a windscreen that doubles as a huge television.
And there wouldn't be any worries about sleepy children losing the remote, as the vehicle's system can be controlled by voice.
Unfortunately for desperate parents, the Sedric  a name derived from 'self-driving car'  probably won't be on the road any time soon. It is a concept car, which often never go into production.
However with the first fully autonomous vehicles expected on British roads by 2020, car-makers are battling it out to create the most exciting designs.
Volkswagen revealed its prototype at the Geneva Motor Show, and stressed it could potentially be bought by individuals.
The German firm said: 'Sedric will drive the children to school and then take their parents to the office, look independently for a parking space, collect shopping that has been ordered, pick up a visitor from the station and a son from sports training  all at the touch of a button, with voice control or with a smartphone app  fully automatically, reliably and safely.'
It can also recognise users, allowing the doors to open automatically. Passengers can then talk to an in-built virtual assistant to direct the vehicle, or even to put on music or other entertainment.
The car is electric and does not have typical features such as a bonnet. However its plush interior includes birch leather upholstery, with air purifying plants.
Volkswagen is also experimenting with the idea of owning a fleet of vehicles that can be hailed by members of the public using a button carried in their pocket.
The 'shared ownership' model where motorists share cars rather than buying their own is expected to become popular in the future as self-driving vehicles take off. Ministers see the concept as a way of cracking down on air pollution, and eventually reducing congestion on the roads.
Last week Nissan became the first major car manufacturer to test self-driving cars on public roads in the UK. The Japanese firm tested prototypes of its Leaf model on busy routes in east London and hopes to make them widely available by 2020.
Small-scale tests of driverless car technology have previously been conducted in locations such as Milton Keynes, Greenwich and Bristol.
A Department for Transport study in January predicted that driverless cars could increase congestion on some UK roads for several years.
Delays on motorways and major roads during peak periods were expected to rise by 0.9 per cent when one in four cars were automated, researchers said.
Their report warned that because early models of driverless cars are expected to operate more cautiously than regular vehicles, it could result in 'a potential decrease in effective capacity and a decline in network performance'.
The analysis suggested that a reduction in congestion might not be achieved until automated vehicles made up between 50 and 75 per cent of traffic.
In November's autumn statement, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced a 390 million investment in electric and self-driving cars. (Daily Mail)

Duminda admits to paying Rs.21 Mn a month for building still unoccupied
	
Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake has admitted that his Ministry has been paying a monthly rental of Rs.21 million since April 2016 for the new building in Rajagiriya though still unoccupied.

Since April last year, we have been paying a monthly rental of Rs.21 million and have informed the Technical Committee to hand it over to anybody who was in a position to complete the construction work as soon as possible, the minister said in an interview with Daily Mirror.
However, when asked what is the reason behind this transaction, the minister said Let me give you an example; say that you are giving out a house on rent and Im interested in renting it out from you, I would tell you that it would take another three months to get the furniture ready. We talk about this transaction in January and then I ask if I may start paying from March since I have to get the furniture done. Would you agree or not The person giving out the building doesnt care about when the building would be occupied. I have to change it to suit the needs of an office complex and this would only be possible once I have actually rented out the building.(Kamanthi Wickremesinghe)

Hands that Rock the Cradle Nobody can Make you Feel Inferior without your Permission
	
Eleanor Roosevelt, American politician, diplomat, and activist, and the longest-serving first Lady of America during her husband Franklin D. Roosevelts Presidency from 1933 to 1945, had once made a short and sweet statement that should be inculcated in the minds of all women. She said, Nobody can make you feel inferior without your permission. It was US President Harry S. Truman President who later described her as the First Lady of the World in honour of her human rights achievements. 
 Remember the dignity of your womanhood. Do not appeal, do not beg, and do not grovel; take courage 
- Christobel Roseanne Barr
 
The centenary of the 1917 silent film, The Hand that Rocks the Cradle falls this year. As the story line goes: A doctors wife publishes and hands out literature on birth control at a time poor women are overburdened by too many pregnancies, growing families and limited income. The police forbid her to speak about the secret that was open only to the rich and closed to the poor. She is arrested, but convinces her husband and a judge of the reliability of her beliefs. 
One Hundred years on, the International theme for 2017 is, Women in the Changing World of Work: Planet 50-50 by 2030. A walk themed, Awakening the [voice] of Women was also held in Colombo under the auspices of Prof. Maithree Wickremesinghe a few days ago. 
The feminist movement, also known as Womens Liberation has been an ongoing encounter for the past 150 years. The UN established International Womens Day [IWD], is celebrated on March 8 to highlight the role and achievements of women in the socio-political field and in global peace and security. 
Women have travelled into space and fought beside men in combat over many decades, and achieved tremendous improvement in many areas of life, but progress has slowed in many places in the world reminding us that no global action can accelerate gender parity. Until 2016 leaders across the world agreed to take action as champions of gender parity with groups and individuals pledging their support -- not only for March 8, but for every day in the year. The beginning of the movement was in the 19th century, when a womens suffrage movement was started under 
A good Daughter is as Good as a good Son - Buddha
Buddha compared motherhood to Buddhahood living in every household. During Buddhas lifetime in India, King of Kosala, Pasenadi was informed that his queen gave birth to a daughter; the birth of a female child was considered to be a sign of misfortune. The King rushed to the Buddha and grieved. Buddha pacified him saying that, a good daughter is as good as a good son. However, no matter how much they agitate nobody gives them power; they have to grab it. Women were looked upon as mere objects that exist under the absolute whims and fancies of the husbands; performing domestic chores and bringing up families.
A myth was concocted that all women are born immoral and the only way to keep them out of mischief was to keep them totally occupied with the task of looking after children and concentrating on domestic duties. Yasodharavo, the former wife in his lay life refused to greet the Buddha on his first visit to the castle after enlightenment saying, If he is concerned let him come to me. Buddha, without hesitation walked into her chambers accompanied by his two chief disciples. A woman was considered a burden on the family. Buddhism does not consider women as being inferior to men, and the husband is admonished to consider the wife a friend, a companion, a partner. In family affairs the wife was expected to be a substitute for the husband when he happened to be indisposed. In fact, a wife was expected even to acquaint herself with the trade, business or industries in which the husband was engaged, so that she would be in a position to manage his affairs in his absence. This shows that in Buddhist society the wife occupied an equal position with the husband. 
The Buddha was the first guru who gave women equal opportunities in the field of spiritual advancement by purifying their minds to realise the bliss of Nibbana. The testimonies of the Theris in the days of the Buddha speak abundantly of this fact. The Buddha realized the social and physiological distinctions that existed. Anguttara Nikaya contains some valuable advice which the Buddha offered to girls prior to their marriages. He realized that there was bound to be trouble with the in-laws, the girls were required to give every respect to them, serving as they would their own parents and to honour their husbands relatives and friends, thus creating a pleasant and happy ambiance in their new homes. In the Samyutta Nikaya, the Buddha says, under certain situations, women are considered more astute and wise than men. In the Sigalovada Sutta, the Buddha emphatically mentioned the duties of a husband towards the wife that a husband should be faithful, polite and not despising, and that he should hand over authority to the wife and provide her with adornments. 
The LIBS, THEMES and WALKS are negative strategies; they create little or no impact. Women need to change their mindset, learning to appreciate values and recognize their potential energies and capabilities. Get over the myth that you are inferior, weak and second-rate. Loretta Young famously said, A charming woman doesnt follow the crowd. She is herself. Women should learn how to tear down cruel ideas of a male-dominated society; shed light on mens love-hate relationship with the women in their lives. She maintains a stable family, nurtures her children, and looks after the well-being of her husband. These roles are ingrained into each of us at an early age. She doesnt know that she is the most important cog in the family wheel. As long as women struggle for equal rights thinking that they had been denied of their rights and always been thought of as having a second-class role in society, or that they are powerless and the property of men; the men will continue to impose their dominance on them. If she doesnt get out of the box she has been raised in, she wont understand how much bigger the world is. 
Margaret Thatcher, the Iron Lady once said, If you want something said, ask a man; if you want something done, ask a woman. 
Why women are termed the Weaker Sex and ancient beliefs
I have an idea that the phrase weaker sex was coined by some woman to disarm some man she was preparing to overwhelm. Anon. 
Jesus Christ never approved of any kind of inferiority. Jesus treated women with grace, compassion, and dignity. Mary Magdalene is the first person to see Jesus after his resurrection. Jesus wanted her to tell others of what she had seen, even though the evidence of a woman at that time was not considered as worth listening to. 
Let Every Woman be a Queen or a Princess
Women are an intricate part of our working society. A womans role is just not in the house; it extends far beyond into the working world where women are even holding positions such as chief executive officers of Fortune 500 Companies. Since women have become increasingly important, the value of the male last name has decreased. The submissive role that many women assume in marriage is a familiar controversy among most societies; a role so common that it is often expected of a female to live under the thumb of the husband. 
In the western world in the early 1940s the role of women changed dramatically with Congresswoman Edith Rodgers and Eleanor Roosevelt presented American society with a bill on May 28, 1941, in the hopes of establishing a Womens Army Auxiliary Corporation. Virginia Wolf gave us a unique view into the changing minds of women and their role in society. She wrote of women who were more concerned with society and decision-making. Women constitute more than half of the global population today. Their contributions socially, economically, culturally, and politically are great yet; their efforts have been accepted at a much lower proportion than those of men though they have proven that they are every bit as competent and qualified as men. 
Nobody objects to a woman being a good writer or sculptor or geneticist if at the same time she manages to be a good wife, good mother, good looking, good tempered, well groomed and un-aggressive.

An appointment made to a high judicial office recently triggered a big controversy inthe country.

Contradictory statements made by the government high-ups and the Bar association created much confusion about the issue later.
While the controversy was raging, a big-mouthed deputy hailing from the Kalutara area received a message from the palace asking him to hold a media briefing without delay to show cause to justify the appointment.
However, the deputy, a member from the black-coated gentry himself, had kept on dodging complying with the request giving some excuse or other.
Livid over the deputys callous disregard for his request, an authority in the highest echelons has now given some specific instructions to the purohita handling the power and energy subject, they say.

He is a holder of a doctorate too.

A high political authority in yahapalanaya the other day surprised this ex-mandarin by offering him the public purse portfolio which is due to fall vacant shortly, they say.
However, the ex-mandarin was not quick to grab the offer with both hands. He replied with a sardonic smile: I once did this job. Should I handle it again
On being pressed to accept the offer, the ex-bureaucrat relented and said: Okay. If I am to accept this portfolio, please at least grant this request of minePlease let me have that former secretary as my secretary as well! He mentioned the name of a onetime top bureaucrat who himself is a doctor.
Taken aback by this unexpected request, the high political authority had said: Ill see about it!

## Title: Leaving the Paris agreement would be a gratuitous thumb in everyones eye

Leaving the Paris agreement would be a gratuitous thumb in everyones eye
	

(c) 2017, The Washington Post  
The New York Times reports that the Trump administration has divided over whether to remove the United States from the Paris climate agreement, a landmark international deal with vast diplomatic and environmental significance. Withdrawing - or asking the Senate to decide what to do, which is effectively the same thing - would be an enormous and possibly irreparable error. This is not a hard call: Staying in the agreement is costless, while leaving would rightly provoke sharp and sustained international outrage. 
The Paris agreement does not formally obligate the United States to make any particular level of emissions cuts. All it does is ask countries to announce emissions plans of their choosing and report on their progress. It has no major implications for U.S. sovereignty and demands no particular policy balance between environmental and industrial concerns. If the Trump administration wants to move that balance toward fossil fuel interests, it does not have to leave the Paris agreement to do so.

President Donald Trump could modify the U.S. Paris commitment, or simply leave President Barack Obamas Paris pledge in place. Although Trump has promised to rip up major elements of Obamas climate plan, other policies, such as congressionally mandated renewables subsidies and state-level efforts, would continue apace. Crushing the Environmental Protection Agencys Clean Power Plan would ill-prepare the country for the significant emissions cuts that it will have to make in coming decades, but it would not keep the nation from reducing its emissions to more modest levels in the near term. If the country is going to be achieving emissions cuts anyway, why not take some international credit for them 
Given all that, leaving Paris would be nothing more than a gratuitous thumb in the eye of practically every important nation on the planet, a bizarre and irrational unforced error. 
The Times reports that Ivanka Trump and others pushing to stay in the Paris agreement might be mollified if the president declared that deal is a treaty that requires Senate ratification, tossing its fate into lawmakers hands. This is just another way to kill it, a ruse that would trick no foreign government. During the Paris negotiations, international diplomats bent over backward to accommodate the U.S. political system, specifically designing an agreement that relies on purely voluntary, nonbinding emissions commitments from every major polluting nation. Many governments would have much preferred a treaty with legally mandatory emissions requirements. But they recognized that the Senate, where rural and energy interests are quite powerful, would certainly scuttle it. 
Neither Trump nor anyone else in the White House should imagine that the global reaction would be any different if the president, in effect, asks the Senate to do his dirty work for him rather than simply withdrawing from the Paris agreement himself. Like it or not, climate change has become a central concern on the global stage that drives a great deal of modern diplomacy. And for good reason: The only workable response to the threat is an international one based on U.S. leadership and mutual trust. Pulling out of Paris would uselessly undermine both.

Myth Buster
	

MYTH: Babies get fever when teething 
BUSTED: Teething doesnt cause fever. Now when you say fever its actually more than about 99.F. Some parents call temperature a bit below that also fever. When babies are teething, they become irritable, which results in them crying all the time. This elevates the temperature a little bit, but not above 99.F. A normal temperature can vary from about 98.4 to 99. But to parents, 98.7 can be fever. So that is probably how the myth came about. The irritability mainly comes from the gums, so that may cause their temperature to increase slightly. When babies are teething, it makes them uncomfortable because they have an itching feeling in the gum. When they cry and gnaw at various things, you have to be careful, because it could cause infection. You can apply a bit of comforting gel on the gum which can be acquired from a pharmacy,

NDB Bank PLC, the countrys top project financier turned fully-fledged commercial bank, says it will raise capital this year to support future growth and BASEL III capital adequacy requirements.
While our capital in 2016 was adequate to meet both our requirements and that of the regulator, our planned expansion and the new Basel III rules will necessitate a fresh infusion of capital in 2017, DFCC Bank Chairman A.W. Atukorala told shareholders in the banks latest annual report. As at December 31, 2016, NDBs Tier I and Tier II capital adequacy ratios stood at 9.31 percent and 12.95 percent, respectively, well above the minimum
regulatory requirements.
NDB raised Rs.10 billion in June 2015 through a
listed debenture.
The countrys largest lender, Commercial Bank PLC this week announced its plans to raise equity capital to the tune of Rs.10.1 billion through a rights issue to support future lending activities and meet the BASEL III capital adequacy requirements without slowing down the banks business expansion. Meanwhile, Atukorala said while focusing on its core capabilities in project financing, the banking group would aggressively expand its SME and microfinancing operations.
While we continue to derive returns from our traditional areas such as project financing, we are also aggressively expanding our reach in areas such as SME and microfinancing.
Through our micro financing programmes we are channelling the skills and knowledge we possess to empower the needy strata of our society and help narrow social and
economic disparities.

North Korea bans Malaysians from leaving  the country over murder investigation
	

(c) 2017, The Washington Post  Anna Fifield  Mar 07, 2017 
TOKYO - Malaysias prime minister accused North Korea of effectively holding our citizens hostage Tuesday, after the Kim regime banned all Malaysians in North Korea from leaving the country, the latest escalation in tensions following the assassination of the North Korean leaders half brother. 
The Malaysian government responded by saying it would not allow North Korean diplomats to leave the country, surrounding the North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur with tape and armed police. 
The moves underscore the sudden breakdown between two non-aligned nations that, until a month ago, enjoyed a pragmatic relationship free from ideological judgments. 
North Koreas official media said Tuesday that Malaysian citizens had been banned from leaving the country. North Koreas foreign affairs department sent a notice to the Malaysian embassy in North Korea on March 7 that it is temporarily banning Malaysian citizens from leaving the country, the report said. 
Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak said North Korea condemned the travel ban as an abhorrent act that was in total disregard of all international law and diplomatic norms. 
As a peace-loving nation, Malaysia is committed to maintaining friendly relations with all countries, Najib said in a statement. However, protecting our citizens is my first priority, and we will not hesitate to take all measures necessary when they are threatened. 
There are 11 Malaysians in Pyongyang: three embassy staff, six family members and two others who work for the United Nations World Food Programme. 
There is no threat to their lives. Let us not come to that point yet, deputy foreign minister Reezal Merican told reporters in Kuala Lumpur. 
Chinas CCTV 13 reported that emergency procedures had been initiated at the Malaysian Embassy in Pyongyang and that people had been burning documents and loading luggage into vehicles, but the report could not be immediately confirmed. 
North Korea suggested the ban would be lifted once the investigation into the death of Kim Jong Nam, the estranged older half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, was completed to its liking. 
The ban is effective until the case in Malaysia is fairly resolved and the safety of the North Korean diplomats and citizens in Malaysia is secured, the state media report said. 
Kim Jong Nam was attacked in a crowded Kuala Lumpur airport terminal last month, his face smeared with a substance that Malaysian investigators said turned out to be VX, a nerve agent and internationally banned chemical weapon. He died within 20 minutes. 
Malaysia carried out an autopsy on the body against the objections of North Korean diplomats in Kuala Lumpur, who insisted that the man - referred to simply as a North Korean citizen - had died of a heart attack. 
Malaysia has refused to release the body without DNA identification from next of kin, but no family member has come forward to provide the match and claim the body. 
North Koreas ambassador to Malaysia, Kang Chol, issued a series of increasingly virulent statements against the Malaysian government, including saying it couldnt be trusted, and was declared persona non grata on Saturday. He left Malaysia on Monday night, bound for Beijing. 
North Korea responded by saying it was expelling the Malaysian ambassador to Pyongyang, but he was already in Kuala Lumpur, having been recalled soon after the attack for consultations with his government. 
After North Korea announced Tuesday it was banning all Malaysians from leaving the country, Kuala Lumpur retaliated. 
We dont mean to do this, but it needs to be done, Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, Malaysias home minister, told a hastily arranged media conference Tuesday. 
The home ministry has made a ruling, effective immediately, that not one staff member or officer of the [North Korean] embassy can leave the country, he said according to The Star. This will be made effective at all immigration exits nationwide. 
Photos on Twitter showed police cordoning off the North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur after the announcement. 
Malaysian police have implicated three North Koreans still in Malaysia as being involved in the attack on Kim Jong Nam. They include a diplomat and an employee of the North Korean state airline, Air Koryo, and all three are believed to be hiding out in the embassy. 
Ordinary North Korean citizens in Malaysia - who number in the hundreds - would still be allowed to leave the country.

Pacific Partnership launched in Htota
	
USNS Fall River, the expeditionary fast transport ship of the US Navy, arrived in Sri Lankas Hambantota Port on Tuesday to provide a platform for the two-week-long multinational humanitarian assistance and disaster relief preparedness mission conducting by the Pacific Partnership.
Pacific Partnerships mission in Sri Lanka include a number of both military and civilian experts from the US, Australia and Japan apart from Sri Lanka.
Civil engineers, medical experts and other specialists are scheduled to hold health campaigns, civil engineering projects including school renovation programmes and health fairs focusing the locals.
Commenting on the first ever pacific partnership mission in the country, Commander Southern Naval Area, Rear Admiral Nishantha Ulugetenne said the mission would help partner nations to work together as one team to overcome any emergency situation with effective results.
At the end of the mission, training will be provided to military personnel to be prepared to handle disasters effectively and how to face them not only in partner nations but also in any nation. Forty eight activities including subject matter exchanges, health camps and band performances would be held during the two weeks, he said.
He said he believed Hambantota was the perfect pick to execute Pacific Partnership.
Meanwhile, Rear Admiral Don Gabrielson of the US Navy said this mission is about building relationships and not about destroying or blowing up unlike defence focused mission.
Commenting on the humanitarian relief campaign, he said disasters or challenges we face, had no concern of the boarders, age or how rich people are.
If challenges come through and you are in the way, then there is an obstacle. We have to come together to face them. Thats when we have to utilize everyones energy, skill and service, he said.
Captain Stanfield Chien, Commander of the Pacific Partnership said though the mission would focus on action to be taken at times of disasters, the mission is more about working together.
Our teams in collaboration with Sri Lankan counterparts are working hard to make sure the projects are done on time. I invite all to visit these projects and experience them, he said.
Pacific Partnership is considered as the largest annual multilateral humanitarian assistance and disaster relief preparedness mission conducted in the Indo-Pacific Region.
Once the mission in Sri Lanka was concluded, the Pacific Partnership would move on to its next missions in Myanmar, Malaysia and Vietnam concluding the 2017 programme.
The USNS Fall River, which provides the primary platform to the mission, has been made out of aluminum instead of iron, to maintain a high speed. The ship, which has a permanent crew of 24, hosts approximately 200 personnel during the Pacific Partnership. It has four engines instead of water propellers and had been made with a unique design to ensure its speed. (Lahiru Pothmulla reporting from Hambantota)

Pan Asia Bank offers up to 17% for fixed deposits
	
Pan Asia Bank has come out with a long-term fixed deposit promotion where customers get the opportunity of receiving interest up to 17 percent p.a. for fixed deposit terms of two, three, four and five years.
Under this promotion, which will commenced on March 5, 2017, there is no upper limit to the amount one can invest.
Pan Asia Bank Deputy General Manager Retail Banking and SME Naleen Edirisinghe stated that this provides an ideal opportunity for customers to lock in a high interest rate for their long-term investments. It is also a great opportunity for investors who look to receive a steady interest income from their deposits as he/she can protect his/her investment from falling interest rates during the tenure of
the deposit.
In a fixed deposit, the return is guaranteed in comparison to most of the other forms of investments regardless of interest rate fluctuations. Also it is a very simple tried and tested investment method that is considered very secure, which will give peace of mind to any investor.
Pan Asia Bank decided to attract long-term funds - the reason being fixed deposits will fulfil an important gap in the market. It also will allow the bank to grow aggressively on certain product categories especially in retail and small and medium enterprise (SME) segments by helping it to strike a balance between long-term assets and long-term liabilities.
Also customers who place these long-term fixed deposits with Pan Asia Bank are entitled to a range of credit facilities such as overdrafts, term loans, import and export loans, personal loans, credit card and so forth up to 90 percent of the deposit, Edirisinghe
further added.
Apart from offering higher interest rates for deposits, a deposit at Pan Asia Bank is a highly secure investment since Pan Asia Bank is a licensed commercial bank which is regulated by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.
Pan Asia Bank,which is known as one of the fastest growing commercial banks in Sri Lanka, currently operates with 82 branches and 81
ATM points.

Police launch online clearance certificate service
	
Sri Lanka Police in line with its 150th anniversary, which falls this year, launched its first ever e-service yesterday by introducing a facility to obtain Police Clearance Certificates online as a solution to the age old manual processing method.
At a special event held at the Police Headquarters in Colombo, Police Chief Pujith Jayasundara launched the new web based service for obtaining clearance certificates online.
The special project incorporated with ICTA (Information and Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka) was introduced targeting both the citizens residing in locally and overseas, who require police clearance certificates for various purposes including for jobs.
The Inspector General flanked by many top ranking officials yesterday boasted how they succeeded in bring the concept of this service drafted in 2013 to a realty giving a remedial measure for the time consuming hassle of obtaining a clearance certificate.
The previous manual process of issuing a clearance certificate required an applicant to appear in person to the Police Headquarters (if the person is locally residing) and fill an application form with personal details and submit it with the required fee.
If someone from overseas is applying, he or she has to submit an appropriately filled application form to the Sri Lankan mission in the respective country of stay with the correct fee as well as certain additional bank charges for remitting the money.
This old method took at least 14 to 21 days to process as it involved lot of paper based applications and documents which had to be cross checked with many agencies with the Department like the CID and the TID.
But with the new e-service anybody who has access to the internet can apply for a clearance certificate even using a smart phone in no time and complete the submission by paying the fee with a credit or debit card as wells as through eZ Cash method. It will take only four to five days, the Police Chief assured.
Representing the ICTA, its official Kanchana Thudugala said it took close to an year to complete the project and that they had linked all the 477 Police Stations countrywide to enable this service to transfer data.
A private software company PWC had assisted in designing the new online clearance certificate.
Application for the online clearance certificate could be accessed through the two URLs www.police.lk and www.gov.lk.(By Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana and Darshana Sanjeewa)

## Title: Pranayama

Pranayama
	
In Yoga, air is the primary source of Prana or life force. Pranayama maximizes the benefits of Prana. Pranayama is used in yoga as a separate practice to help clear and cleanse the body and mind. Pranayama increases the bodys immunity, as the enhanced oxygen and blood supply brings health to the body. Pranayama can retard or reverse the effects of lung damage in smokers. Pranayama also helps control the mind during stress. It helps relax and de-stress not only the mind but also the body. Recent research has shown that Pranayama is an effective solution to stress. As the management of stress through modern medicine essentially brings severe side effects, ultimately stress is multiplied by side effects in the long term. 
Hence, Pranayama is like a multivitamin capsule. Practicing pranayama regularly keeps problems at bay. 
You can prevent or cure heart disease, arthritis, impotence, obesity, menopausal problems, ulcer, fatigue, colds, viral infections and dozens of other illnesses - all with just a few minutes of practicing Pranayama daily. 
Poor breathing leads to a variety of diseases such as hyperventilation syndrome that causes everything from tiredness, chest pain and sexual problem. When you take rapid, small, upper body (chest) breaths you wont get enough oxygen. 
The quick exhalation of carbon dioxide when breathing fast disturbs the balance of acidity and alkalinity - pH in blood. When acid levels drop, a complicated reaction occurs that keeps blood cells from delivering oxygen to muscles and organs including brain. This can lead to high blood pressure, a racing heart and shallow breathing that lie at the root of many illnesses including heart disease. 
Researchers have proven that Pranayama (breathing exercises) slows heart rate, lowers blood pressure, improves the immune system and reduces anxiety. 
Alternate breathing brings calmness, balance and unites the left and right sides of the brain. If you practice Pranayama in the morning, you can begin the day stress-free, feel wide awake and ready to tackle any problem.
Many ailments are caused by incorrect breathing. They can be alleviated - and even cured - through specialized techniques in Pranayama. 
This discovery is causing quite a storm. Mainstream medical science doesnt like being outperformed by ancient natural remedies.
Ancient traditional healing techniques reveal how to breathe diseases right out of your body.
Breathing exercises like Pranayama have been used for thousands of years to cure everything from a cold to heart disease. 
During breathing exercises, you breathe more oxygen into the lower lobes of your lungs. You actually radiate Prana (vital life energy) throughout your body. When you practice Pranayama, your prana is able to travel through your body freely and smoothly. The bodys organs and systems are in a state of harmony, healing and preventing diseases. Most diseases are caused due to the obstruction of free flow of Prana through your body. Free travel increases the bodys immunity as the enhanced oxygen and blood supply gives vitality to body. 

Pranayama is a safe and simple way to balance your physical, emotional and mental state. More doctors are prescribing Pranayama as a complementary and alternative medicine to drugs in some hospitals abroad. Pranayama and meditation are also introduced to students in some schools. Furthermore, millions of people practice Pranayama globally to alleviate stress and enhance their lives.
A Pranayama practitioner reaps the following benefits with regular practice :- 
Healthy body free from disease. 
	Extended life expectancy 
	Positive effects in the abdomen, liver, urinary tract, small and large intestine and digestive system
	Veins and vessels are purified, physical lethargy is removed. 
	Improves general health of the body and boosts appetite. 
	Spiritual powers awaken, which in turn give spiritual joy, lightness and mental peace. 
	Due to fast inhalation, carbon dioxide levels in the blood reduce and oxygen levels increase. The rich oxygenated blood is supplied to vital organs, improving their functioning.
	Due to rapid exchange of gases on cellular level, toxins are removed and cells are revitalized. 
	The fast movement of the diaphragm increases efficiency of digestive organs, lungs, and heart 
	Pranayama is good for increasing the overall Prana in the body 
	It can also get rid of excess mucus, help in removing sinitis and common cold. 
	It stimulates the vagus nerve which runs from the stem of the brain to the abdomen. It is part of the parasympathetic nervous system which is responsible for the bodys rest and digest activities. This process calms the body, slows the heart and helps control pain. 
	Our state of mind is closely linked to the quantity of Prana within. The more content a person is, he or she feels Prana inside. The more disturbed a person is, the more Prana is dissipated and lost. In Yoga, we try to make use of these connections so that Prana concentrates and can freely flow within us. 
	Maintains functioning of the digestive system and cures all stomach diseases. 
	Relieves diseases related to heart, lung, and brain, Asthma, bronchitis and tuberculosis are very common diseases across the world. More people are affected with these diseases now. Pranayama helps those suffering from these lung-related problems. 
	Pranayama is beneficial in the case of high cholesterol, gastric trouble, acidity, respiratory problems, allergy, diabetes, high blood pressure, migraine, kidney disease, sexual disorders in men and women and even fatal diseases like cancer. 
	It can prevent hereditary diseases like diabetes and heart problems. Regular practice of Pranayama removes blockages in the arteries, cleaning them and preventing heart attacks. Pathogenic cholesterol triglycerides, HDL, LDL are also controlled. 
	Prevents aging and is beneficial in controlling hair loss, premature greying of hair, wrinkled skin, poor eyesight and forgetfulness. 
	Gives a natural glow and shine to the face. 
	Keeps the mind calm, peaceful and cheerful. 
	Gives strength to meditate for several hours. 
	Pranayama cures physical problems, removes foreign particles from body. 
	Overcomes vata, pitta and kapha problems 
	Beneficial in cases of obesity, constipation and gastric probelms 
	Relieves depression. 
	Relaxes the mind and body. 
	Complete cure of small illnesses has been seen to take place as early as three days. Even on day one, ailments like asthma have been cured. 
	Chronic ailments like partial paralysis are cured after a few days of treatment 
	Improves athletic performance. 
	Helps weight loss. 
	Raises energy levels. 
	Regular pranayama keeps the body healthy, fit and mind fresh and resolute. The dependency of seeking medical help for many types of ailments can be significantly reduced. 
	Negative thinking disappears and there is a positive change in mindset. Bad habits like drinking, drugs and lust can be gotten rid of. 
	Whatever happens in the mind influences the breath; the breath becomes quicker when we are excited and quieter when we relax. 
	Yoga practitioners know how to breathe diseases right out of their body. 
	Imagine pranayama is protecting you from heart disease, arthritis, impotence, fatigue sleeplessness, colds, virus, ulcers, menopausal problems, tuberculosis and dozens of more serious diseases  all in just a few minute a day. 
	Pranayama boosts immunity. Enhanced immunity helps prevent diseases. 
	It boosts sex drive, reduces anger, eases gout, lessens arthritic pain, breathing problems, controls appetite and food craving. 
	Positively affects abdomen, liver, urinary tract, small and large intestine and digestive system. 
	Spiritual powers awaken, which in turn gives spiritual joy, lightness and mental peace. 
	Pranayama provides benefits to the body that are both perceived by the release of melatonin in the body and physiological in nature. 
	Some of the major findings over the past years have shown a very statistical improvement in blood pressure. Studies support the reduction of systolic blood pressure and therefore an overall blood pressure reduction. Other discoveries include lowered heart rate and a switching over of the stress response which is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system over to the parasympathetic nervous system. Haemoglobin and red blood cell counts also increase significantly after a short period of practicing pranayama. Another study showed a connection with reduced rate of obesity, diabetes and even some psychiatric illnesses. There is also an association with improved breathing in those suffering from asthma. 
	Practice of pranayama helps restore normal respiration, which can reduce the chances of going into a seizure or help stop a seizure in people suffering from epilepsy. It helps reduce the frequency of seizures. 
In short, pranayama is a viable treatment choice and is preferable to prescription medication. More doctors abroad are utilizing Pranayama as an adjunct practice to modern medicine. Local doctors should also consider introducing this amazing therapy to our hospitals too.

SAITM crisis Marching For the Greater Good
	
Have you ever wondered why State medical students have taken to the streets to protest against the private medical faculty at Malabe, the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) Has this resistance evolved in fear of an imminent trepidation on their part or is this an act of utilitarianism 
The right to education which was confined to the highest social stratum until the 1940s was extended to all individuals regardless of their socioeconomic statuses subsequent to the introduction of the free education system. This decision paved the way for the underprivileged to reap the benefits of higher education. If we envisage an ideal scenario, for instance in a country with a staggering economy and a cornucopia of resources, the co-existence of State and private medical education systems would have been an incentive for healthy competition. Nevertheless, provided the current economic and political circumstances in Sri Lanka, it does not take an expert to comprehend the impracticality of such an existence.
Firstly, let us not forget that money, without any doubt, plays a crucial role in ones way of living. Money is an essential necessity. This provides a faultless explanation as to why the human resources of State universities will be drawn to alluring offers made by private universities and will by and by relinquish their positions in State universities to work for private universities instead. One could have, with resolution put to rest the aforementioned as mere assumptions. Yet there is a profusion of instances where brain drain from State to private universities has transpired. At its inception, SAITM has taken on 20 professors in the course of a relatively-scant time frame of eight years. In contrast, only one professor was appointed to the Eastern Medical Faculty not months but weeks ago.
This brings us to the second point that needs scrutiny which is the prejudiced stance on SAITM that is evident through the actions of the present and previous governments. A common misconception that has grown itself into general consensus is that State universities are proud possessors of a colossal pool of resources. The statistics of each and every State medical facultys human resources would prove otherwise. Curtailment of human resources in already-struggling State medical faculties should not pass the point of imagination for the sake of conciliating with a wealthy and powerful minority. The million dollar question is why every single government carries the propensity to extend its benevolent arms of approval towards the flourishing establishment of private medical faculties like SAITM, when the inauguration of Sabaragamuwa Medical Faculty is thwarted owing to the Ratnapura Hospital not being on par with the standards of a proper teaching hospital.
Speaking of teaching hospitals, clinical training is an integral part of medical education which should essentially be provided at a hospital that has an adequate patient circulation and the required units with optimal functioning. The Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH) on the other hand, to date, lacks the requisite patient to student ratio and thus has not been recognised as a teaching hospital. This fact was emphasised in parliament by President Maithripala Sirisena during his tenure as Health Minister in 2012. Moreover, at the outset, SAITM did not have a teaching hospital, which suggests that it was more of a revenue-based organisation than a teaching institution. How can a patient who seeks treatment from a State hospital rely on a doctor who has not had satisfactory clinical exposure If the public healthcare sector were to absorb these untrained, substandard doctors produced by SAITM, it will demote the superior health indices hitherto maintained in Sri Lanka.
The Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) is the professional body that safeguards these health standards by way of regulating the entire healthcare sector including medical education. Several committees appointed by the SLMC conducted quality inspections to find out that SAITM did not meet with the standards specified by the medical council. Furthermore, they stipulated recommendations by way of offering a second chance at their medical degree being recognised by the SLMC. In lieu of amending flaws in their system, they resorted to obtaining a court order to gain provisional registration from the SLMC, which rendered the SLMC an impotent body, marking this, the first occasion that a medical council of a country was deemed powerless at the expense of patients lives.
In conclusion, it is high time that the government paid attention towards the turbulence which has been created by this debacle. Measures should ideally be adopted by the officials who are entrusted with the task of serving the general public to nationalise SAITM rather than assuming expedient schemes. In addition, if private medical education were to be established in Sri Lanka, the government should put forward policies that would ensure the production of quality doctors, employing stringent screening from the entrance to the final MBBS examination. Further, guidelines pertaining to teaching hospitals must be incorporated in these policies and means of providing training forensic medicine and community medicine. Appointments which can only be completed at a government hospital should be attended to in due course. Finally, to answer the question whether the State medical students are rebels with a cause, yes: they are fighting for the greater good, not even at the expense of the minority, but with the heartfelt compassion of doing them justice as well.

(State medical students)

An ugly symptom of a dreadful sociopolitical syndrome
North Colombo Medical College, SAITMs de facto predecessor, another source of political trouble
	This country has to straighten its spine and say unto its own citizens enough is enough
Democracy and socialism have nothing in common but one word, equality. But notice the difference: while democracy seeks equality in liberty, socialism seeks equality in restraint and servitude.
~Alexis de Tocqueville
According to Wikipedia, the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) was established in 2008 by Dr. Neville Fernando with the aim to provide tertiary qualifications in Medicine, Engineering and Information Technology, Management and Finance, Information Communication Technology and Media. The institute was initially affiliated with the Nizhny Novgorod State Medical Academy (Russia), the Asian Institute of Technology (Thailand) and Buckinghamshire New University (England), awarding degrees through those respective institutes. In 2011, SAITM applied for recognition from the University Grants Commission (UGC) as a degree-awarding institution, with the ability to award its own degrees. The UGC, in 2013, granted SAITM such a status despite protests from the Inter-University Students Federation (IUSF) and the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA). SAITM held their first convocation in March 2013, conferring degrees to ten students from the Faculty of ICT and Media and eighteen students from the Faculty of Management and Finance.
Today, SAITM is embroiled in a crisis-laden situation in which the two partners in the governing coalition are facing a decisive showdown, a showdown between two diametrically antagonistic sociopolitical schools of thought. While the United National Party (UNP) and its leader Ranil Wickremesinghe find themselves in the corner of private sector-backed open market economy, President Maithripala Sirisena and his Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) traditionally oppose private sector-backed ventures in the sector of education, a subject they think has to be severely controlled and regulated by the government with no quarter given and none asked for. The well-chronicled schools-takeover in 1962, its wholehearted support of Buddhist schools and portraying them as the vanguard of a nation determined to rise after 450 years of colonial rule, stands as monument to those sociopolitical policies in the sixties and seventies.
North Colombo Medical College, SAITMs de facto predecessor, another source of political trouble for any government, had one serious and determined backer in the then Executive President, J.R. Jayewardene. NCMC in fact made it a point to record its deep appreciation of those who helped to make the NCMC a fulltime working private Medical College. Aside from J.R.J, those who supported this novel education venture were Dr. Stanley Kalpage as UGC Chairman, the then Secretary of Higher Education Prof. Stanley Wijesundera and the academic staff of the Colombo University. (Source: Wikipedia).
Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), at the time led by firebrand Rohana Wijeweera, launched a pitiless attack on the NCMC since its inception. Wijeweera had the full support of the left-wing political parties in Sri Lanka at the time and this issue of the NCMC was a sharp weapon in his hand and Wijeweera used it in his failed attempt to topple the government in the late eighties in his murderous and vicious campaign which was mistakenly called the second revolution by some social scientists. Wijeweeras attempt to portray NCMC as an agent of the capitalist class ended up in a bomb attack on its administration building in 1988. Yet, the Board of Management of NCMC conferred its own medical degree MBBS (NCMC) instead of the one from the Colombo University.
However, it was the UNP leader, the then Executive President Premadasa in 1989, who appointed a committee made up of K.H.J. Wijedasa (Presidential Secretary), W.M.P.B. Menikdiwela (Former Presidential Secretary), Dr. Ananda Guruge, a respected educationist and Bradman Weerakoon, another high-end civil servant, to look into the NCMC. Soon after, the NCMC was nationalised with the government deploying the army to occupy the buildings. Its board was replaced by a Competent Authority, Prof. Carlo Fonseka. He continued as the first Dean when the NCMC was transferred to the Kelaniya University as its Medicine Faculty. Premadasas populist policies saw to it that a private sector venture was once again placed in the government machinery. Ironically enough, it is this NCMC struggle where current Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne had his baptism in Sri Lankas politics. It was indeed a baptism by fire. Rajitha Senaratne at that time was at the forefront of the oppositions bout against NCMC.
Twenty eight years later, this same issue, medical degrees accorded by a private medical school in particular and opposition to private sector-backed education venture in general, is irritating the government in power -- this time a coalition between the very antagonists who fought vigorously against each other in the eighties. Once again, a reformed Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, this time led by a non-violent Anura Kumara Dissanayake, is in the forefront to lead a campaign against SAITM and its very existence as an educational institution that offers recognised degrees. In a bizarre development, however, Vice Chancellor Professor Ananda Samarasekera, is on a leave of absence, relating to his alleged involvement in the Wasim Thajudeen murder case. How more bizarre this case could become, one does not know.
Yet the central issue remains the same. Sri Lankas unproductive flirtation with government-run institutions and organisations continue, emphasising an utterly destructive anti-private sector syndrome, a syndrome that has been imparted by the traditional left in the fifties, sixties and seventies and now carried out by the current JVP and its cohorts in the twenty first century. Our medical students who get into the university straight from high school are recipients of a free education from lower kindergarten up to the university level. And even the university education is free up to a point, thanks mainly to Lalith Athulathmudalis Mahapola scholarship scheme. Their opposition to others getting a paid-education and receiving an award of certificate to practice medical profession is a sign of a malignant mindset, perverted by false socialistic promises offered to them by politicians who are equally perverted by a false system of sociopolitical school of thought. Growing incapacity of the left-leaning politicians has crippled our political dynamic and caught in this vortex of incapacity, they use an extra-sensitive issue to malign a system that is already in a state of deep indecision.
To make matters even more malevolent, those who offered licenses and other go-aheads during their time in power to the same institutions are among the chief antagonists to the issue. Politics is playing its cruel ironies with the lives of our student population. The government seems to be in a grip of not knowing what to do. Lack of steadfast determination to settle an issue with all the sensibilities of a nations vulnerable segment is making the government justifiably unpopular with all segments of society.
In this context, it is pertinent to write here what a speaker at a convocation ceremony of the NCMC stated: I remember, at the beginning I quoted Victor Hugo who said No army can withstand an idea whose time has come but I made a mistake, we were actually ahead of our time by over 1 1/2 decades. Today private sector and privatisation are no longer dirty words in the vocabulary of nearly every political party. I wonder sometimes what would be the attitude of those who criticised us, if some group decides to start another private medical educational establishment in our country today. It will certainly make an interesting scenario. His words still echo in our private and public chambers of discussion and debate.
This country of ours has to wake up from this benumbing state of complacency. It has to clear its cobwebs of the dead past. It has to straighten its spine and say unto its own citizens that enough is enough. Clinging on to anachronistic socioeconomic theories, however much they are covered with a veneer of social justice is not going to serve any meaningful purpose in the long run. The world has discarded socialism as a working economic system. The Mogul of capitalism has risen his head and never to bow down again. The so-called developing world is no longer categorised in that insulting way anymore. Second and Third-World jargon are fast disappearing from the world of international finance and economics. Corporate finance and corporate accountability are replacing government-held institutions. Those countries which are arguably the most corrupt and dishonest in their dealings, those governments which are essentially family-driven and henchmen-bonded are the ones which demand government interference into the world of global financing and global trading.
China and Russia may stand as exceptions to this rule, yet both these countries would have gone to the garbage can of history but for the fact they graduated from a slumping system of Marxist Socialism to regulated capitalism. While those very countries which dominated the cold war in the fifties, sixties and seventies, with whom countries like Sri Lanka, Indonesia, the Philippines and even India had romantic flirtations died a very sad and sudden death. Delivery of the utopia was not delayed, it was denied. Those leaders who led revolutionary movements except perhaps, in Cuba and Vietnam were eventually discarded by their very followers. In such a realistic and authentic context, why Sri Lankan leaders are scared of a paper-tiger of socialism is not comprehensible.

Separate lane for passenger buses
	
Introducing the pilot project - Priority lane for passenger buses, as a means of reducing the traffic congestion in Colombo and suburban areas, Minister of Megapolis and Western Development, Patali Champika Ranawaka yesterday said more than ten million vehicle movements within the Western Province is reported per day according to the recent census.
The minister said the recent census revealed that during the rush hour time from 6am - 9am, around 8,000 people had travelled in 180 passenger transport buses while 9,000 persons travelled in 4,700 private vehicles showing that the private vehicles had carried only two passengers per vehicle.
The Minister also said the less quality and comfort in the public transport services and the increase in income has diverted people to private transportation methods.
In the 1980s, 85 per cent used public passenger transport for their daily use. Today, the situation has changed almost by 50 per cent. The public has shifted to private vehicles such as Cars, Motorcycles and Three-Wheelers, he said.
The Minister pointed out that if 40 passengers use their own private transport, instead of a bus, it would need around 10 bus space in the road.
Minister Ranawaka said the demand for new roads increased regularly due to private vehicle users, however, it is not possible to do so now as it costs more time and money.
Further, the minister said, he doesnt believe that the project would be successful only as an isolated project.
This is only the beginning. After monitoring the progress of this project, the original concept should be upgraded by introducing a new bus service, cashless ticketing system, new time schedules, vehicle parks and passenger information, he said.
Meanwhile, the Minister said the new practice would put into effect by March 17 at the Parliament Road and at the Old Kotte Road and expecting an outcome of 250 per cent efficiency. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Sexual harassment on public transport Does  She  Travel Safe
	
What is sexual harassment 
According to the UNHRC policy on harassment, sexual harassment is an unwelcome sexual advance, request for sexual favours, verbal or physical conduct or gesture of a sexual nature, or any other behaviour of a sexual nature that might reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause offence or humiliation to another. Sexual harassment may be deliberate, unsolicited and coercive 
Section 345 of the Penal Code (Amendment) Act,
No.22 of 1995 states: 
Whoever by assault or use of criminal force, sexually harasses another person, or by the use of words or actions, causes sexual annoyance or harassment to such other person commits the offense of sexual harassment and shall on conviction be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to five years or with fine or with both and may also be ordered to pay compensation of an amount determined by court to the person in respect of whom the offence was committed for the injuries caused to such person. 

 90% of women sexually harassedon public transport
	 Authorities assure actionif victims complain
The International Womens Day, celebrated today calls for a more inclusive, gender-equal world. Women more often than not, are at a disadvantage simply for being born a woman. While there are issues pertaining to the wage gap and the glass ceiling preventing a woman excelling professionally, women irrespective of class, creed and race, are also subjected to sexual harassment almost daily wherever they go, which in turn crushes their confidence and reduces their productivity. Hence, this years theme-Be Bold for Change- is timely, and all men and women should act promptly and with vehemence to put an end to all forms of gender-based violence which include sexual harassment anywhere. 
A recent study by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) revealed that 90% of women between the ages of 15 and 35 have been subjected to sexual harassment at least once. This revelation is no surprise as public transport has always been known to be a place where men harass women and walk off scott free. The study further reveals that only 4% sought help from the police. While reasons for not taking action could vary, one of the main reasons is the lack of confidence on the police force and the justice mechanisms that action would be taken expeditiously. The forms of sexual harassment found on public transport include deliberate touching of a part of the body, excessive closeness, improper seating etiquette, rubbing genitalia against another body, trampling another persons foot deliberately, fixed gaze on parts of the body, suggestive looks and asking for telephone numbers. 
The UNFPA organised a press conference recently to brief the media on the findings of the study. The panel of speakers included representatives from the UNFPA, government authorities and civil societies and they expressed thoughts on this despicable trend. Speakers highlighted how perpetrators acted with impunity while victims never complained because of this very impunity. While emphasising on the need to prevent such incidents, the speakers also dealt with practical difficulties encountered in lodging complaints. 

How is it that men have developed such impunity surrounding such offences
Paba Deshapriya
- Grass-rooted Trust 
Sexual harassment on public transport should be looked at from the perspective of a symptom of a disease and not as a problem. Where ever women go they are at least verbally abused. They are treated as objects, said activist Paba Deshapriya from the Grass-rooted Trust. 
Remarking that women were sexually harassed not only in buses and trains, but also in market places, schools, workplaces she pointed out how a study conducted in 2014 showed that among South Asian countries Sri Lanka ranked first in the list of sexual harassment in media institutions. 
I understand that there are so many complaint mechanisms, redress mechanisms and I appreciate them. But at the same time we need to look at how we can address this issue comprehensively, she said adding that sexual organs did not give men the power to feel superior to harass women or take advantage in treating women in a demeaning manner. How is it that men have developed such impunity surrounding such offences she quizzed. 
Since 1994 development partners have recommended relationship education in schools where children are taught respect to self, to differences and others. How is it that we have not been able to come to a long-term solution even with these longstanding recommendations In our society there is no concept of self-respect and respecting others. We respect either a person older to us or with more power(like ministers). Women are not represented in both these groups, she added. 


It is a form of gender based violence. 
-Ritsu Nacken
- UNFPA Sri Lanka Representative 
Ritsu Nacken, the representative of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) elaborated on the findings of the study done in 2015 with participants from all 25 districts.The findings revealed a shocking reality. 90% of women and girls between the ages of 15 and 35 have experienced sexual harassment at least once when travelling in buses or trains. What was even more alarming was that only 4% sought help from legal enforcement agencies. 50% of women said that they used public transport as means to travelling to work and of them 37% said that the harassment they experience affects their productivity at work, she said 
Stressing that sexual harassment was a socio-economic issue that must be addressed as a national priority she added that there were many contributory factors that need to be addressed as outlined in the national action plan. There is the need for strengthening response systems, legal enforcement and the need for positive behavioral change. Positive behavioral change is a long term process that includes empowering the victim, to speak up, empowering the bystander to intervene and ensuring the perpetrator is held accountable, she noted. 
Sexual harassment violates basic human rights. It affects women physically, psychologically and economically. It is a form of gender based violence which can occur anywhere even at home, the workplace or the street, she added.

If that wereyour mother, your daughter, your aunt, your grandmother, would it be the same 
Una McCauley-
United Nations Resident Coordinator 
Una McCauley, the Resident Coordinator of the United Nations posed a though-provoking question to the audience. My question to all those perpetrating unnecessary touching, crowding, rubbing of genitals, trampling on people, fixing their gaze on peoples body parts, making suggestive and lascivious looks, if it was your mother, your daughter, your aunt, your grandmother would it be the same Its not how you would treat them. If that is how you treat them then its time to get help. 
It is 2017 and we question as to why women dont participate in the workforce, why women dont like to go out, why women feel uncomfortable participating. Well, this is one reason why women dont feel comfortable. And thats not a 2017 you can be proud of, she added. 

Women who are subjected to harassment dont take sufficient action. 
Swarna Sumanasekara
- Chairperson of the National Committee on Women
Women who are subjected to harassment dont take sufficient action. There are legal provisions to institute action against offenders. But hardly any woman makes a complaint and they are often silent. Very few go to the police to institute action, said Swarna Sumanasekara, Chairperson of the National Committee on Women. 
Noting that sexual harassment on public transport is a common occurrence she said such sexual harassment was one of the areas outlined in their action plan. There are proposals to install a hotline to receive complaints by those who are harassed on public transport. The ministry is working on awareness programmes especially with regard to prevention, intervention and for advocacy, she said. 

Sexual harassment is a wrongdoing that can be filed as a criminal offence.
ASP L.R. Amarasena
- Head of Children and Womens Bureau
of the Sri Lanka Police 
Pointing out that prevention was paramount to resolve the issue in discussion, ASP L.R.Amarasena, Head of Children and Womens Bureau of the Sri Lanka Police said that there was much hesitance among women to lodge complains on sexual harassment in public transport. Explaining as to why women did not complain she said, No one who has used public transport to travel will be able to say that she has not experienced harassment. They try to bear the harassment and abuse, and proceed as they want to reach their destination as fast as possible. So in the interim if we are harassed, we dont want to go to a police station. 
Stressing that sexual harassment was a wrongdoing that can be filed as a criminal offence she said that women she has spoken to expressed unawareness. For instance they didnt know they can seek redress before the law, when subjected to sexual harassment. 
As the police we conduct special raids where we send a group of police officers to buses and trains. In this manner we have been able to catch a fair number of offenders. We have even gone to courts with the data obtained through these raids. This methodology will be used by the headquarters, the child and women office branches of the 42 police divisions to conduct raids this year as well. People are afraid of punishment. A possible offender might hesitate to harass women when he sees a police vehicle. The thought that the team of police officers who are looking into harassment are around might make them reluctant, ASP Amarasena said. 
Noting the practical difficulties that rise when trying to apprehend offenders and how available mechanisms can be used, ASP Amarasena said that the emergency hotline, 119 can be used to inform police and that they would take prompt action. A bus is on the move. Suppose we start our journey from Pelawatte and the bus takes the route to Borella. Then if a victim is harassed she can call 119 and inform police where she is and where the bus is headed to. So the tip will be given to the Borella Police and the Thalangama Police, who will stop the bus on its way, she said.  The 119 service enables us to act promptly as its an emergency service.Apart from that if the identity of the perpetrator is known complaints can be made to 1938 or 2444444(Children and Womens Bureau ). Complaints can be lodged verbally or in written form, she added. Emphasising on the importance of procuring evidence she said that the testimony of a witness is important before courts. Even if men appear in court women hardly come. People can video or record using their mobile phones. Such video clips and photos are shared on social media. These can be used as evidence, she said highlighting the social responsibility to prevent sexual harassment. 
Women and children have a right to inform the bus driver or conductor of the harassment they face at that time. Then they can take the perpetrators to the closest police station. If its a rural area they can be taken to an area where police officers are often present, she added. However the study conducted by the UNFPA quotes a key informant saying that she had seen bus conductors unnecessarily touching small children.

The Sri Lankan Diet Dos and the Donts
	

Sri Lankans have inherited a truly unique culinary heritage owing to the fusion of local delicacies with cuisines adapted from various countries over the centuries. Our local food is diverse and with time we have adapted to more modified versions of food because of the foreign influence. When it comes to Sri Lankan food, there is something to satisfy everybodys taste palate. Not only does Sri Lankan food cater to the taste department, it is also remarkably healthy. We take pride in our intake of greens such as mallung and kola kenda. Regardless of all the healthy food that Sri Lankans boast about, we still find that more and more people are susceptible to diet- related chronic diseases. 
What you eat can greatly affect your health and well-being.There is no doubt that healthy foods can reduce the risk of heart disease, cancer and various other diseases. Our diet also has a direct impact on our mental as well as physical well being. Children with a poor diet run the risk of growth and developmental problems which can also affect their academic performance. 
Rice has been a staple food for many centuries and Sri Lankans love their rice. We are notoriously known to pile rice on our plates into what resembles a small mountain. The consumption of rice to vegetable, meat/fish ratio is rather high. This undoubtedly proves to be problematic and should be taken into serious consideration. The idea of how much people eat is more important than what they eat. The relative importance of food volume versus food quality has been misinterpreted. 
Daily Mirror spoke to Dr. Anoma Chandrasekara, Nutritionist on the subject. 
According to dietary recommendations, an adult needs to eat 3 to 6 cups of boiled rice per day to 2 cups of boiled rice per meal or an equivalent amount of cereals or yams. However, Sri Lankans consume more than 2 cups of boiled rice per meal. Proportions from each food group, namely, cereals, yams, vegetables, fruits, animal protein, pulses, milk, dairy products, nuts and oils are not at optimum levels. Starchy foods give us energy in the form of carbohydrates. 
There are three major macronutrients that the human body needs in order to function properly. Carbohydrates, protein and fat. The intake of carbohydrates should be 55% to 60% and the intake of proteins should be 25% to 30%. The intake of fat should be between 15% to 20%. These are the correct proportions that we should focus our dietary intake. Your diet should provide energy at an adequate level from carbohydrates, protein, fats, vitamins and minerals, in addition to other non-nutrient compounds. 
It is important to follow a healthy, nutritionally adequate (balanced) diet, while maintaining regular physical activity to achieve and maintain good health. It also helps to reduce non-communicable diseases such as cardio-vascular diseases, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, cancers, fatty liver diseases, chronic kidney diseases and other various illnesses. 
Incorporating nutrient-dense foods while being within calorie limits based on age group, activity level, gender and physiological status is important and a variety of food within each food group such as vegetables, greens, red and orange fruits and vegetables as well as eggs, meat and poultry should be included.

TNA divided on granting time to SL
	
The Tamil National Alliance (TNA), the main opposition in Parliament, is reportedly divided over its stance on the move underway in the United National Human Rights Council to grant the Government a two-year extension to implement the resolution adopted in 2015.
Ten TNA MPs have signed a letter sent to the UNHRC asking it not to grant such an extension. However, TNA Leader R. Sampanthan was said to be opposed to the letter being sent to the UNHRC. In this view, Mr. Sampanthan is supported by MPs M.A. Sumanthiran, Mavai Senathirajah, Srinesan, Shanthi Sriskantharajah and K Kodeswaran. 
The TNA consits of four Tamil parties -- the EPRLF, ITAK, TELO and PLOTE. Among them, the ITAK, to which Mr. Sampanthan belongs, is the dominant ally. However, some ITAK MPs are also known to have signed the letter. 
The UN Human Rights Office, in its report on Sri Lanka, raised concerns about the slow pace in ensuring transitional justice in Sri Lanka. 

At least three MPs belonging to the Tamil National Alliance have not signed this letter though some 8 to 11 MPs who are of the view that no further time should be granted to the Sri Lankan Government to implement Resolution 30/1 of October 2015 are reported to have signed this letter. Mr. Sumanthiran said.
He said these MPs had informed the Party that their names appear as signatories despite the fact that they had expressly refused to sign it.

Two mandarins to get walking papers
	

Two white collar bigwigs at secretarial level are about to get the walking out papers,they say.

One of them is a character whose name was mentioned in connection with the gazette notification that triggered a big hullabaloo in the country. Those at the top in yahapalanaya have alleged that the high-ups occupying key positions in the nerve-centre of the countrys economy have been sitting on files instead of taking important decisions and implementing key plans of the government.
The other bigwig facing the chop is the one holding the highest position at secretarial level at the countrys main secretariat. His successors name is already being mentioned in official circles, they say.

US military deploys advanced defensive missile system to South Korea Cites North Korean threat
	


Dan Lamothe  
(c) 2017, The Washington Post, Mar 07, 2017 - 
The U.S. military began deploying an advanced defensive missile system to South Korea on Monday, a long-awaited move that was agreed upon with the government in Seoul last summer and follows a series of provocations by North Korea. 
The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system does not use warheads, and is designed to shoot down enemy ballistic missiles like the ones launched by Pyongyang into the Sea of Japan on Sunday. The deployment comes despite protests from Chinese officials, who have said repeatedly over the last year that it is threat to Chinese security. 
Continued provocative actions by North Korea, to include yesterdays launch of multiple missiles, only confirm the prudence of our alliance decision last year to deploy THAAD to South Korea, said Navy Adm. Harry Harris, the chief of U.S. Pacific Command. We will resolutely honour our alliance commitments to South Korea and stand ready to defend ourselves, the American homeland, and our allies. 
The deployment was announced as North Korean state media reported that the four missiles Pyongyang launched Sunday were practice for a North Korean attack on U.S. military bases in Japan. Three of the missiles traveled about 600 miles over North Korea and the Sea of Japan before landing inside of Japans exclusive economic zone. The fourth landed just outside the EEZ. 
North Korea also is believed to have thousands of artillery cannons aimed at its southern neighbour, a particular concern for Seoul because the city of 10 million is within range, 35 miles from North Koreas border. 
Each THAAD battery includes at least six truck-mounted launchers that carry up to eight missiles each. U.S. military officials stress that it provides strictly defensive capabilities, but it also possesses powerful radar that Chinese officials are concerned will be used to observe Chinese airspace. 
The United States and South Korea began discussing the deployment of THAAD more than a year ago, and reached an agreement to do so in July. Former President Barrack Obama reaffirmed U.S. commitment to the deployment in October, saying Washington and Seoul have worked together to prepare for any threat. He specifically cited THAAD as an example, while calling it a purely defensive system to deter and defend against North Korean threats.
