<U+200B>Court orders private hospital to release the body
	
		 		 
		 
			
A Colombo court yesterday ordered the management of Lanka Hospital Corporation PLC that a body of a deceased person be immediately released to the close relatives, which was reportedly retained under hospital custody for seven days until the hospital bill was settled.
The deceased Tilak Daluwatta of Ragama, Batuwatta (62) had died in the Hospital on September 11 while he was receiving in-house treatment at the hospital following a by-pass surgery.
While ordering the hospital management to release the body of the deceased person to a close relative, Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris observed that respecting the dead was a matter of paramount importance. He further maintained that there was no legal provision to retain a body under anyone?s custody and stated that the hospital could take civil action against the parties over defaulting the hospital bill, if the need arose.
A sibling of the deceased had made a complaint with the Narahenpita Police alleging that the hospital management had retained the body under hospital custody since the relatives of the deceased had not paid the bill amounting to Rs.1.4 million.
The complainant told police that his brother was admitted to the hospital on August 25 for a by-pass surgery since they had been informed that the surgery would cost Rs.650,000. He further stated that they took measures to pay a sum of Rs.300,000 at the beginning. He said his brother?s health condition started to deteriorate even after the surgery was performed on August 25. He further stated that hospital authorities did not take notice on his request that the patient be transferred to the National Hospital in Colombo. (Lakmal Sooriyagoda)

President Maithripala Sirisena said today the Death Penalty would be introduced from next year with the approval of Parliament.
Addressing the national Drugs and Alcohol Temperance programme held at the main hall of the Galle Municipal Council, he said the decision to introduce the death penalty was taken in the aftermath of the several incidents of rape and the recent killing and sexual abuse of Seya Sandevmi.
?I am in a position to impose the death penalty using the executive powers vested in me. But, I thought that the better option was to discuss it with Parliament before introducing the death penalty,? the President has said. (D.G.Sugathapala)

UNHRC resolution should be turned in SL?s favour: Ranil
	
The United Nation Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) resolution should not be publicised but rather diligently turned in Sri Lanka?s favour, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
Commenting on the UNHRC issue at a ceremony held to mark the 109th birth anniversary of Mr. J. R. Jayewardene last evening, Mr. Wickremesinghe said the UNHRC issue should be handled with care.
Mr. Wickremesinghe referred to a recent report which proposed the passage of an Indemnity Bill to deal with the UNHRC. He said passing such a bill would be disadvantageous to Sri Lanka as the purpose of such legislation would be to pardon those who had committed crimes. ?Passing and implementing an Indemnity Bill would mean pardoning persons who had committed crimes. Why should we rush to bring in legislation to pardon criminals when we have done nothing wrong and when no one has accused us of doing wrong?? he said. He said the UNHRC had not said that Sri Lanka had committed war crimes but only made allegations.
He said only thing Sri Lanka need do was to take advice on modalities for setting up the court (from international bodies) and stick to a domestic investigation on the alleged human rights violations; and not involve any international bodies.
Mr. Wickremesinghe said the issues should be handled diligently -- as things were handled by Mr. Jayewardene when he was president. He said Mr. Jayawardene?s style of handling things carefully had helped the country to remain undivided. (Yohan Perera)

UN Chief encouraged by SL response to war crimes report
	
United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki Moon has noted that he was encouraged by the response of the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) towards the recently released UN report on the country as well as the commitment expressed by the Government to implement effective measures to address issues of accountability.
In a statement issued by the UNSG on Thursday, he stated that he is also encouraged by the commitment expressed by the GoSL to consult widely with all stakeholders in designing mechanisms to address the existing issues pertaining to alleged abuses that occurred during the conflict period.
While stating the Secretary-General welcomes the report on Sri Lanka, the statement further adds, ?He hopes that its important recommendations will help support the efforts of the people and the Government of Sri Lanka to carve a durable path toward long-lasting peace and stability and respect for human rights, through a genuine and credible process of accountability and reconciliation that meets international standards.? The victims of all communities, their families and the Sri Lankan nation itself demand no less than a full and proper reckoning.?
He has also commended the action plan presented by the government at the opening session of the 30th UNHRC session while urging the Government to ?continue building on this positive momentum and the international community to support Sri Lanka in this regard?.
It was during a media briefing last afternoon that Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera said that the four-tiered accountability mechanism presented by the government of Sri Lanka to which includes a domestic inquiry process, would be established by end of January 2016 following consultations with all stakeholders on its design and particulars.
He also confirmed an international role in the process in the capacity of expert advice and technical assistance. The proposed four-tiered mechanism activities are planned to conclude within 18 months. (Lakna Paranamanna)

UNHRC report Milder  than expected- President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena said yesterday the report on Sri Lanka presented at the ongoing UNHRC sessions in Geneva was 100 or even 1,000 times less harmful than the report that would have been presented at the UNHRC if not for the change that took place on January 8.
At a meeting with the Editors and media organization heads at the President?s House, the President flanked by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera said the action taken by the government to address Human Rights and Governance issues and moves towards reconciliation had resulted in the International Community?s growing confidence in Sri Lanka.
He said there was a danger of several names being included in the report, but the positive image presented to the world by the current government had prevented such an eventuality. The President said the international community had given a good response to the work done by the government where there were many concerns earlier.
He said the government was following a non-aligned foreign policy which was bearing fruit and that the 19th Amendment which pruned certain Executive Powers of the President and broadened the democratic space was not only beneficial to the citizens of the country but also built up Sri Lanka?s image internationally.
The President said it was best for the country to have a government without Mahinda Rajapaksa to move forward and added that certain extremist elements were trying unsuccessfully to create problems.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the names did not come up in the UNHRC probe report because of the hard work of the government in the international front.? He said it was the successive steps taken by the previous Rajapaksa regime after it entered into an agreement with United Nations Secretary General which led to the probe on Sri Lanka. ?
The Prime Minister said he was not even given a chance to meet the UN Secretary General when he came to Sri Lanka at that time and when he saw the agreement which was reached he knew it was going to be troublesome for the country.?
He said now the current government was working in a positive manner to deal with those issues and address the concerns through a domestic mechanism and that the matters would be dealt with after the Paranagama and Udalagama commission reports are presented.? Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera said on October 30, the international community which was divided over Sri Lanka earlier would stand behind the country in a united manner.
Justice and Buddha Sasana Minister Wijedasa Rajapakshe and Media Minister Gayantha Karunatilleka were also present at the meeting.
