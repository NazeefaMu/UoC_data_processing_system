CB probing Panama Papers: Mahendran
	
The Central Bank was investigating into the materials linked to the Panama Papers and the individuals, who are possessing offshore accounts, Governor Arjuna Mahendran said today.
However, he said the authenticity of the so-called leaks was doubtful and therefore, couldnt reveal any names of individuals, due to privacy laws. But I dont want to jump into any conclusions in terms of names and facts that have been mentioned in the media etc. because we have to act responsibly as there are international conventions which cover these types of data, and we dont want to flout any of those and even our own laws which guarantee privacy to individuals. Unless people are being prosecuted in terms of confirmed territories in our courts of law, it would be wrong of us to give out any preliminary information, he said.
We have got some of those papers and we are requesting information from our counterparts around the world in terms of Central Banks and other investigative arms of various governments, he said at a press conference at the Central Bank.
At this point all I can say is that we are investigating the material and we are waiting for more material to come. There are millions of pages of documentation in this whole leak of documents.
That itself is an issue because of provenance of the materials, who leaked and all that could lay some doubts on whether that those documents are authentic, the Governor said.
So, we have to prove that the documents themselves are authentic and they are factually correct before we can proceed to any conclusions. All that will take time. Its not something that we can process in a week or a month. There are various names in the documentation but like I say we have to check whether the documentations are authentic. People could have planted names and thats always the possibility. And this information came from third parties. It didnt come from the original source. We have to be responsible and authentic before any firm conclusions can be brought," he added.

Hong Kong gets tough with illegal entrants from SL too
	
The Hong Kong Immigration Department yesterday issued a stern warning that human traffickers who arrange unauthorized entrants to Hong Kong from Sri Lanka and seven other countries would face a HK$5 million fine and a jail term in the future, The Standard said.
Assistant Director William Fung Pak-ho told the Standard that under the current Immigration Ordinance, anyone who arranged for unauthorized entrants from China, Vietnam or Macau faced up to 14 years in prison and a HK$5 million fine.
The department also wants to stretch the shortlist by adding eight countries including Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Somalia, Afghanistan and Nigeria. We also hope the legislation raising the maximum penalty to 14 years in jail for snakeheads of illegal immigrants from South Asian countries will be passed by July, Fund said.
Currently, those eight are under the category of "other countries of places." Traffickers arranging for unauthorized entrants from any of those eight face up to seven years' jail or a HK$ 600,000 fine.
"Data from the past five years showed that 90 percent of the illegal immigrants were from those [eight] countries," Fung said. "If we later find that illegal immigrants from a specific country are increasing, we could issue an order and add the country to the list."
As of March 2, there were 11,160 non- refoulement claims pending screening. Non-refoulement is an international law principle of not sending a person back to a place where he or she may be persecuted.
A Legislative Council document showed that the department has been studying how to detain more illegal asylum seekers, following suggestions of setting up a detention camp.

Malinga should be cleared by SLC docs for IPL: Thilanga
	
Sri Lanka Cricket today said that Lasith Malinga could not play the cash-rich Indian Premier League (IPL) unless he was cleared by SLCs team of doctors.
Malinga, who led Sri Lanka to the 2014 World Twenty20 title pulled out of this years tournament, due to a recurring bone-bruise in his left-knee, but tipped to play for the Mumbai Indians at the IPL from the second half of the tournament.
He cannot play in the IPL unless he gets the clearance from the team of doctors appointed by us, SLC Chief Thilanga Sumathipala said.
Once he informed us of his state of injury, we will ask our medical experts to assess his injury to decide, whether he is fit to play or not, he added.
Sri Lanka Cricket has also initiated a disciplinary inquiry against Malinga for making public statements without permission.
On the eve of his departure to India, Malinga made a scathing attack on the cricket administrators for allegedly meddling with selections and also faulted the selectors for picking him for the World Twenty20 with an injury.
Malinga has to realise that he is dealing with a new set of cricket administrators. Had we running cricket seven-years ago, he would not be making these comments today. We will deal with him for what he has said. But if he is cleared to play by the doctors, we have no issue him representing Sri Lanka, Sumathipala added. (Champika Fernando)

One power plant at Norochcholai shut down

Panama papers; Amarapala resigns
	
Megapolis and Western Development Ministry today said though there was a concerted effort by certain interested parties to link Ministry Consultant Vidya Amarapala to the so-called black money scandal Panama Papers he had never been involved in such illegal transactions and added, Mr. Amarapala had decided to resign from his post to facilitate any possible inquiry.
The attention of the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry has been drawn to the listing of the name of Ministry consultant Vidya Amarapala in the Panama Papers exposure. Panama is considered a haven for high-end tax dodgers in the world. The tax evaders and holders of slush fund accounts have used company Mossack Fonseca as a front to stash away their ill-gotten lucre. However, the list exposed by some websites in Sri Lanka that includes Mr. Amarapalas name does not have any link to Mossack Fonseca or Panama Papares. It was a list of names of Sri Lankans published in 2013 who had allegedly held accounts or had companies in Singapore.
Mr. Amarapala was the Chairman of the CEB between 2010 and 2011, a time during which public concerns had been drawn to financial scandals involving the CEB which was even raised in Parliament. Mr. Amarapala has served as an executive at the IWS Holdings Ltd. owned by Mr. Arthur Senanayaka between 2003 to 2010. He has maintained this particular account while serving as a Director of the Sovereign Capital Corporation (SCC) belonging to Mr. Senanayaka, and that company had never been involved or charged for any wrong-doing up to now. It has also invested in Sri Lanka through the BOI.
However, it was a fact that the consensual government has received a mandate from the public to save the country from corruption, mismanagement and maintain the rule of law and promote the concept of good governance. Therefore, this government is committed to adhere to that principle and honour the trust reposed on it at any cost. Therefore, it is quite pertinent that we must not only refrain totally from corruption, mismanagement and any other misdeeds but behave in a manner no one could level an accusing finger at us.
Mr. Amarapala has decided to keep away from all his responsibilities and functions of this ministry and to tender his resignation papers to Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka with the hope that it will be easier if the Ministry decides to conduct any investigation into the issue.
Minister Ranawaka's Secretary has been directed to lodge a complaint to the Financial Crime Investigation Division (FCID) to inquire whether the SCC had been involved in a financial fraud in any way during the period 2003 - 2010 when Mr. Amarapala was serving there. (SAJ)

Sri Lanka is also "interested" in the project to build a bridge connecting both the countries, Indian Road Transport, Highways and Shipping Minister Nitin Gadkari said on Monday.
"The project is under consideration, it is under discussion. But nothing has been finalised," Gadkari told journalists at the Foreign Correspondents Club in New Delhi, the Business Standard reported.
He said discussions have been held on the issue with Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe. Even the Asian Development Bank has made a recommendation regarding the project.
However, on March 23, Mr. Wickremasinghe said that no formal talks between India and Sri Lanka had started on the project.
The issue had figured in the Sri Lankan parliament as well.
Gadkari, who had earlier favoured the Sethu Samundran project, declined to answer any question on the same, saying the model code of conduct is in place in Tamil Nadu in view of the assembly election.

Union Banks new brand positioning gains intl recognition at Global Excellence Awards 2015
	
Union Bank received the award for Excellence in Branding in the Banking, Financial Services and Insurance sector at Global Excellence Awards 2016 held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The award acknowledges the great strides made by the Union Bank brand within the banking industry of Sri Lanka, subsequent to the repositioning of the brand as a fully-fledged commercial bank in 2015.
Commenting on the award, Union Bank Assistant Vice President Marketing Thishani Dissanayake said, We are honoured and delighted to receive international recognition for the success in building Union Banks brand. The banks focused efforts in re-establishing the brand as a fully-fledged commercial bank in a bid to propel its new strategic direction, have enabled us to build widespread, sizable audiences within a short time period.
Following the landmark capital investment by the global investment giant TPG in 2014, today Union Bank has assumed a new business model and a fresh brand outlook, having embarked on an ambitious journey towards becoming a leading, household financial brand in Sri Lanka. In line with this strategic direction, Union Bank developed a comprehensive corporate brand building strategy themed Make the rest of your life the best of your life, in a bid to reach identified brand objectives. The award affirms the success of these brand building efforts that have secured noteworthy visibility and market presence in a highly competitive industry, within a brief period of time, Dissanayake further stated. 
The Union Bank brand has a 20-year history in the Sri Lankan banking industry. Initially established to provide financial solutions to corporates, it was later repositioned to take advantage of business opportunities in the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector, which was seen as a niche catered to by few banks. Over the years, Union Bank has built up a strong identity as a preferred SME banking partner for aspiring entrepreneurs.
Led by a bold and ambitious strategic direction, the bank has now diversified its product and service portfolio to establish itself as a fully-fledged commercial bank. Supported by the strength of TPG, today Union Bank has etched a solid foundation of financial stability for itself backed with international know-how and best practices. The bank now aims to fully leverage on its strong standing, global expertise and experience garnered from the new pathway inked, to reposition the bank as an industry leader.
The banks strategic marketing initiatives have paved the way for Union Bank to become one of Sri Lankas well established brands, within a short period of time. The brand has received numerous accolades as an endorsement of its strong brand presence. The Union Bank brand was recognised as one of Brand Finances Most Valuable Brands in Sri Lanka for three consecutive years and was also awarded the Best SME Bank Sri Lanka 2014 by Capital Finance International UK.
