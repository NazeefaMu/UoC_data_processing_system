Batti airport opens for service
	
More domestic airports in the country would be developed to accommodate 60-seater aircraft, Civil Aviation and Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said while commencing civil aviation at the Batticaloa Domestic Airport today.
The airport after renovation was declared open by President Maithripala Sirisena on July 2016.
However, operations were deferred as the airport had to conform to international civil aviation requirements, which are now fulfilled, the Ministry said.
The Batticaloa airport, which has a 1,066 metre long and 46-metre wide runway, was installed with a new runway lighting system and a new passenger terminal building at a cost of Rs. 1,400 mn.
Minister De Silva said the civil aviation service in the country would be expanded so as to serve local and foreigners.
The airport was renovated with the intention of promoting domestic airlines and also to expand local and foreign tourism in the Eastern Province, he said.
I hope that we could be able to increase tourist attraction trough the domestic air service. Such airports are much needed in the country especially when the country is being developing economically and socially, he said. 
The Ministry said the Government encouraged establishment of flying schools and related industries.
The Government understands the need of having scheduled air services between domestic airports for sustained promotion of internal air transport and any airline, which commences scheduled flights to Batticaloa, would be given free landing and parking for a period three months from date of opening of the airport for civil use, the ministry said.
The Ministry said that currently Cinnamon Air was operating twice daily scheduled flights to Batticaloa and a few more airlines have indicated willingness to commence scheduled flights to Batticaloa airport.
The airport has a total land space of 145.2 hectares and the portion thereof amounting to 75.9 hectares has been retained by Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) for continued operation of its air base.
Separate access has been provided for civilians to enter the airport without the need of undergoing the strict security screening process.
The Civil Aviation Authority took over the Batticaloa Airport which had been used by the military for its operation for nearly three decades during the war.(By Darshana Sanjeewa)

Colombo Zonal Education office orders Principals to give due respect for politicians
	
The Colombo Zonal Education office issued a letter to the Principals of Colombo schools to give due respect for Parliamentarians and PC members who attend to special school functions.
In a letter dated February 20 sent to all schools within the territory of Colombo Zonal Division, Zonal Education Director P.N. Silva had ordered the principals to invite Parliamentarians and PC members, who represented the area to special school functions and principals were bound to give Members of Parliament due respect when they attended such events.
Attached with the letter was a list of Provincial Council (PC) members, who represented Colombo Zonal Education Development Structural Committee.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Ceylon Teachers Union (CTU) General Secretary Joseph Stalin said the move was an insult to the Principals.
By ordering Principals to respect politicians, the Colombo Zonal Education office had risked the State officials dignity and respect. With such a move schools could be entirely politicized, he said.
He said that in the wake of the controversy over Uva Province Chief Minister Chamara Dasanayake, who allegedly used abusive language and forced a female Principal of a school in Badulla to kneel, the order could further the political influences and unnecessary interferences in education officials duties.

Government to introduce Freedom of Speech Act
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that the government is contemplating introducing a freedom of speech Act as one of the alternatives for the racial and religious unrest.
The Prime Minister who was speaking at the 44th convention of the Bar Association of Sri Lanaka (BASL) on Saturday said Sri Lanka is looking at this option and also other alternatives such as Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act of Singapore, Racial and Religious Hatred public order Act of UK, Racial Discrimination Act of Australia and Criminal Code of Canada to avoid incidents similar to Gintota and Kandy.
He also accepted that some may perceive that Freedom of Speech Act might control freedom of speech. "The main issue is to define hate speech and I would like to ask BASL's support for it," he said.
He said the government is also looking towards ways and means to control social media in order of controlling of hate speech and to avoid a Cambridge Analatica drama where data of 50 million people is said to have been used to influence the outcome of election in the US.
The Prime Minister said government will have discussions with all religious leaders including the Mahanayaka Theras, Cardinal, Ulamas and Hindu Kurukkals to get their opinion on controlling hate speech. (Yohan Perera)

Modi govt officials look at Sri Lanka differently without understanding: Gota
	
At the peak of the war against the LTTE, then defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa was the most feared and powerful man in Sri Lanka. The UN Human Rights Council had asked Sri Lanka to probe war crimes in which Gotabaya was accused. Nearly a decade later, the 68-year-old is being talked about as a possible presidential candidate, with brother Mahinda Rajapaksa not able to contest again due to the constitutions upper limit of two terms. He lives in a small two-storey house in Colombo, guarded by not more than two security personnel.
In his first interview since 2010, Gotabaya spoke about the geopolitical situation in the region, the changing character of Indian diplomacy, the meaning of peace, and his own role in the war:
India helped Sri Lanka during the war, but there is a feeling that Colombo is betraying India by moving closer to China.
If you read Shivshankar Menons book (Choices  Inside the making of Indias foreign policy), the former Indian National Security Adviser has categorically said that Sri Lanka had given India assurance and shown that it was concerned about any threats to Indian security concerns. Our government never allowed Sri Lankan soil to be used by any foreign country against India Diplomacy is an art of reciprocity, it is about engagement, conversations and mutual trust. In diplomatic relationships, you cannot replace empowered diplomats with intelligence officers. India has to come out of this China phobia with regard to its relationship with Sri Lanka.
But will Indias concerns lead to a change in your approach
We had a very good understanding with the Congress government in India, especially its bureaucrats. We were able to get their fullest support in defeating the LTTE. But the new government, especially the bureaucrats of the Narendra Modi government, look at Sri Lanka in a different way Without understanding it properly, without knowing the real facts on reports about submarines being docked at a Sri Lankan port even the Indian media played it up. Bureaucrats should have (talked to us).
There are concerns here too, such as among Sri Lankan patriots about India working against the interests of Sri Lanka. For example, it is a known thing that (Indira) Gandhi supported and trained the LTTE in India. That created a huge anti-India feeling The Sri Lankans feel there is unnecessary influence by Indian governments in its internal affairs. That was seen at the time of change in the last government too (in which Mahinda was defeated, and Maithripala Sirisena became President) The Indian government has to be more concerned about this and study the situation, rather than act in haste.
Are you in touch with India
No, they dont talk to us (laughs). Thats the other problem. During our time, it was normal for diplomats to meet opposition leaders here. Not only diplomats but even visitors from India would meet opposition leaders. But now, even the Indian High Commission is frightened to meet us. I dont understand why. I dont know why the Sri Lankan government is also worried about them meeting us.
A decade after the war, do you think peace is at hand
The war lasted 30 years. I consider the post-war developments in Sri Lanka a bigger victory than defeating the LTTE. But that has not been recognised by international organisations as well as the international community. Within a short period of 2009 to 2014, we achieved a lot. Not only infrastructure development, but political achievements too. In 1998, the provincial system was introduced, elections held in the north after the war (2013) were not mere polls but free and fair elections.
There were many friendly groups who fell out of favour with the LTTE, like the EPDP (Eelam Peoples Democratic Party), Karuna (Amman, former LTTE commander) Before the elections, we disarmed them. We could have conducted the polls without disarming them. If we allowed that, the Tamil National Alliance wouldnt have come to power. That means Mahinda Rajapaksa would have remained President. But we ensured a fair election process. We knew we were going to be defeated, still we gave them a chance to select their own people
By the end of 2013, about 90 per cent of houses and land had been released to the people. Massive development works such as roads, railway, electricity projects were completed. We also rehabilitated almost all the terrorists who surrendered
You have to understand that peace doesnt come overnight after three decades long war. There are people who were brainwashed ideologically. I wont say wounds are healing now, as I dont know what has happened in the last three years. But I strongly believe that what is important is economic freedom for people, before talking about political freedom. Political freedom is necessary, but what they are talking about is devolution and all that. That is secondary. What people needed was food, employment and basic necessities to rebuild their lives But Tamil politicians put their political interests above these essential needs of people.
Are these going to be major priorities if you come back to power
Yes. We will continue to do what we were doing To give them opportunities, to make them feel they are equal, like the rest of the country.
Tell me about your two brothers (Mahinda and Basil, who served as advisor to Mahinda when he was president). How often do you talk to each other What is the secret behind this relatively tussle-free relationship in power
We always work as a team (laughs). We think about the country. (But) we rarely talk (laughs again). During the war, we used to interact more often.
This unity comes from our (earlier) days. Unity is strength, that is what our father (D A Rajapaksa, the founding member of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party) taught us It is the basic principle for all countries as well. If you divide with ethnicities and religion and all that, outsiders and foreign powers can influence your country. Our aim must be to forget other things and unite.
Many believe that you have blood on your hands. That as defence secretary during the war, you defeated the LTTE but were also behind the killing of thousands of civilians. What do you say to these charges And how did war affect you personally, did you have sleepless nights
I know I havent done anything wrong, I know I have done the correct thing. My conscience says that. When you ask about civilian killings, you must understand that war is not a rosy thing, whether it is in Sri Lanka or Afghanistan or India or Pakistan or Iraq. War is not a good thing, it is not a nice thing. But in Sri Lanka, I didnt create the war, I ended the war. Ending the war was much better than what it was. Our country is a better place without the LTTE. Today, the President of Sri Lanka can go to Jaffna and speak there Today it (Jaffna) is a free country.
It is not only soldiers but innocent people too died due to terrorism. Bombs do not understand who is enemy and who is friend, or if it is a civilian or military van. So I do not regret. I used to sleep every day during the war too.
Were there any last-minute negotiations with the LTTE before the end of the war Did LTTE leader Prabhakaran reach out
I didnt believe in negotiations with the LTTE, I still believe it would have been a waste of time. Prabhakaran was not a wise (enough) man to call me, but look at KP (LTTE No. 2 Selvarasa Pathmanathan, widely known as Kumaran Pathmanathan or KP). When he was brought to Colombo from a foreign country, he was shivering, he thought it was his final moment He is living very happily still because we were willing to understand his past and mistakes, and we allowed him to lead a normal life. The rehabilitation of KP was a great thing. We still believe in that.(The Indian Express)

New Qantas 17-hour flight breaks aviation records
	
The "Kangaroo Route" from Australia to Britain became a shorter hop Saturday (March 24) when the first direct passenger service left Perth for London, with the 17-hour flight set to break aviation records.
Qantas' 14,498km journey from the south-western city to London is the world's third-longest passenger flight, the Australian carrier said, and the first ever regular service to connect the two continents directly.
Captained by Lisa Norman, it will also be the longest Boeing Dreamliner flight in the world.
The new link is part of Qantas' ambitious plans, unveiled over the past two years, to add ultra long-haul flights to its global schedules.
This will eventually include non-stop flights from Australia's eastern seaboard to Europe in an effort dubbed "Project Sunrise".
Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce last year said such flights were "the last frontier of global aviation ... the antidote to the tyranny of distance and a revolution for air travel in Australia".
The world's second-oldest airline operated its first "Kangaroo Route" service, from Sydney to London, in 1947, when it took four days and nine stops.
Joyce called the new Perth-London service a "game-changing route". Tourism officials hope the shortened travelling time will open up Australia's less-populated west coast to more domestic and international visitors.
A key concern for the Australian airliner has been beefing up comfort levels for the ultra-long journey, with passengers set to enjoy improved air quality, lower cabin noise and reduced turbulence.
Some passengers will also wear special monitors and devices so researchers from the University of Sydney can collect data on their sleeping and activity patterns, mental state, eating patterns and hydration before, during and after their long flight, Sydney's Daily Telegraph reported.
It is not the first time Qantas has undertaken a direct flight from Australia to Europe.
The carrier in 2015 flew a one-off charter service from Perth to Istanbul to take Australians to Turkey's Gallipoli to mark a centenary since troops from the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) fought there in World War I.
Qantas also flew one non-stop passenger flight from London to Sydney in 1989 with a Boeing 747.
Some of the world's longest non-stop international flights include Qatar Airways' 14,535km Doha-Auckland service, Emirates' Dubai-Auckland 14,200km service, United Airlines' 14,000km Los Angeles-Singapore journey and Qantas' 13,800km Sydney-Dallas route. - AFP

SL Navy denies reports on harassment on fishermen
	
The Sri Lanka Navy today denied the Indian media reports of harassment against Tamil Nadu fishermen who forcibly entered the Lankan territorial waters near Katchatheevu islet in the recent past.
When Daily Mirror inquired of several reports published in the Indian media, Navy Deputy Media Spokesman Lieutenant Commander K K C Udayanga said it was a regular allegation made by several Indian media and was baseless.
According to SL Navy, over 1,000 fishermen across the Tamil Nadu coastal belt enters into Lankan territorial waters near Katchatheevu islet violating the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) three times per week.
However, he said the SL Navy only chase them away over to IMBL, however, no harassment was done to them.
I strongly denied the Indian media claims that we damage fishing equipment of Tamil Nadu fishermen. It has been identified by both the Indian and local naval authorities that the Southern Indian fishermen enter local waters on each Monday, Wednesday and Friday via Katchatheevu islet. It was our duty to protect the Lankan territorial waters and to prevent any illegal activity in our waters.
It has been a challenge not only to us but to Indian authorities to prevent violation of maritime boundaries by Tamil Nadu fishermen. However, we have given a specific attention on the said days to minimise their entry to Lankan waters.
We chase them according to the international protocol on such situations and also in the presence of the Indian Coast Guard officers. We do not have authority to cause any damage or harm to fishermen, he said.
Further, he said naval activities in the vicinity of Katchatheevu islet was in collaboration with the Indian Coast Guards and it always concerns the bilateral connection between the two countries.
Meanwhile, in a report published by the Hindustan Times Sunday (25) it had said that Over 2,000 Tamil Nadu fishermen were chased away by the Sri Lanka Navy and their nets cut off.
The fishermen from this island town had ventured into the sea in 565 boats on Saturday and were fishing off Katchatheevu when the Sri Lankan naval personnel came to the spot and snapped the fishing nets of 30 boats before driving them away, Rameswaram fishermen Association president S. Emerit alleged, the report added.
According to the report the fishermen had urged to take steps to retrieve Katchatheevu from the island nation and restore the traditional fishing rights of the Indian fishermen.
The long-standing dispute over Katchatheevu islet was settled following India ceding the Katchatheevu Island to Sri Lanka in 1974, however, it was reported that Tamil Nadu fishermen who constantly violate the Sri Lankan Maritime Border. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Smith, Warner stand down from Australia captaincy
	
Australia captain Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner have stood down from their respective leadership roles for the remainder of the third Test in Cape Town.
Wicketkeeper Tim Paine will act as captain at Newlands, with both Smith and Warner set to take the field on Sunday.
Cricket Australia CEO James Sutherland said: "Following discussions with Steve Smith and David Warner they have agreed to stand down as Captain and Vice-Captain respectively for the remainder of this Test match.
"This Test match needs to proceed, and in the interim we will continue to investigate this matter with the urgency that it demands.
"As I said earlier today, Cricket Australia and Australian cricket fans expect certain standards of conduct from cricketers representing our country, and on this occasion these standards have not been met. "
CA chairman David Peever confirmed the board chose Paine, 33, as interim captain.
"The Board of Cricket Australia has endorsed Tim Paine to step in as Acting Captain for the remainder of this Test," Peever said.
"Both Steve and David will take to the field today under Tim's captaincy.
"The Board fully supports the process for an immediate investigation into what occurred in Cape Town. We regard this as a matter of the utmost seriousness and urgency. We will ensure we have all information available to make the right decisions for Australian Cricket."
Smiths departure from the Test captaincy comes in the wake of revelations the Australians admitted to ball tampering on day three.
Opening batsman Cameron Bancroft was captured using yellow tape to alter the condition of the ball in the afternoon session on Saturday before hiding the foreign object in his pants once the umpires got wind of the wrongdoing.
Smith and Bancroft fronted the media after play and confessed the leadership group had devised the plan to manipulate the ball, with Smith taking responsibility for the actions of his team and his rookie opening batsman.
Smith said last night he had not considered standing down as captain, but it appears in the last 12 hours the 28-year-old has had a change of heart.
The morning after admitting to ball tampering, Smith was noticeably absent as his team warmed up ahead of Sunday's play at Newlands.
Last night, Smith took responsibility for Australia's decision to attempt to alter the condition of the ball on day three, an act carried out by Test rookie Cameron Bancroft that was exposed by television cameras.
