Another round of talks on ETCA in August
	
India and Sri Lanka will begin another round of talks on the proposed Economic and Technological Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) on August 9, 2016, Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade, Malik Samarawickrama informed Parliament yesterday.
The minister denied the allegation made by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake that plans were afoot to sign the agreement in August this year. ?The talks will begin on August 9 and will be completed only in December,? he said.
He assured the House that it would be kept informed on the negotiations pertaining to ETCA. ?The final document will be tabled at least one month before the signing,? he said.
Mr. Dissanayake said the final document should be tabled at least three months before the signing. ?The usual practice of this government is to inform Parliament on important moves at the last moment. But I would like to request that the final document be tabled at least three months before the signing, so that a proper debate could be held and any necessary changes made,? he said.
Mr. Dissanayake added that ETCA would not bring top Indian IT experts to Sri Lanka as they were already attracted to Europe and other parts of the world. He said only IT experts of the lowest rank would come to Sri Lanka as a result of ETCA.
However the minister averred that such a thing would not take happen.
Mr. Dissanayake asked whether the oil tanks in Trincomalee and Hambantota would be handed over to the Indian Oil Company or any other private sector organisation, Mr. Samarawickrama said the CPC and the IOC would share the tanks in Trincomalee.
Minister of Petroleum Resources, Chandima Weerakody, who also responded to the question pertaining to oil tanks in Hambantota, said the CPC had been given an oil bunkering licence after 2008. (Yohan Perera and Kelum Bandara)

Body of SL expat worker to be buried in Saudi
	
The Consular Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry today said they had got approval from the family of Mohamed Siyan Shihabdeen (32), a Sri Lankan expatriate worker who was allegedly stabbed to death by his room-mate in Yanbu, Saudi Arabia a few days ago, to bury his body in Saudi according to Islamic religious traditions.
Mr. Shihabdeen, a resident of Kekirawa, had been working as a glass cutter in a private firm in Yanbu.
Speaking to Daily Mirror, an official from the Consular Affairs Division said the victim?s body would be buried after police investigations into his death were concluded. The police investigation report had not yet been issued, the official said. ?Therefore, we cannot give any details as to how the death occurred, and who was involved in it,? he said.
However, Arab news said the Yanbu Police had already arrested a Yemeni worker who was working in the same shop as Mr. Shihabdeen. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Criticism of UN approach towards SL abuses legitimate: Helen Clark
	
Helen Clark, one of the frontrunners to succeed Ban Ki-moon as UN secretary general, has said there were legitimate criticisms of the way the UN dealt with Sri Lankan abuses during the civil war with the LTTE.
Clark, the 37th Prime Minister of New Zealand is now the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). ?
Her tough approach to management efficiency and cutting budgets has won her plaudits from the US administration, the UN?s main funder, but prompted grumbling from within the institution, the Guardian reported on Thursday.
Foreign Policy magazine recently carried a probe into Clark?s management style that reported widespread disgruntlement among staff.
The article talked of a ?trail of embittered peers and subordinates? in UNDP and told the story of an official who was allegedly driven out by Clark in retaliation for the employee?s participation in a critical review of the agency?s response to human rights abuses in Sri Lanka.
She has denied that her reorganisation of UNDP had been an internal disaster. She said the number of employment tribunals brought by individuals was ?tiny, a handful?.
Clark also dismissed the claims about the allegedly retaliatory treatment of the official: ?I have no evidence of that. There were legitimate criticisms of the way the UN dealt with Sri Lankan abuses during the civil war with the Tamil Tigers, but the conflict was officially declared over a month after I started at the helm of UNDP. It was before my time? she told the Guardian.
Clark said the UN was struggling over global security. ?The UN is seen to be not doing so well on the peace and security front,? she said.
Clark said that the UN?s archaic bureaucratic structure was proving a drag on its ability to help in the fight against extremist attacks. ?We have the tools from the middle of the last century to fight today?s battles, and we can do better than that.?
She said: ?If we are going to effectively fight violent extremism it?s not just intelligence and security cooperation that?s important, it?s addressing the root causes. That takes you into development, human rights, peace-building: how can we get them to work in harmony to address these issues??

## Title: Donald Trump accepts Republican presidential nomination
## Section: Breaking News

Donald Trump accepts Republican presidential nomination
	
Donald Trump formally accepted the Republican nomination for president on Thursday night, giving the biggest speech of his short political career ? seeking to end a troubled, fractious GOP convention on a high note.
The nominee entered to stirring string music, with the jumbotron displaying only his name ?TRUMP ? in gold letters above his head.
?Friends, delegates, and fellow Americans, I humbly and gratefully accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States,? Trump said. Then he joined the crowd in their chants, ?USA! USA!?
Trump?s speech cast the U.S. as a chaotic nation, where disorder and crime ?threaten our very way of life.? He portrayed himself as a man who could end it, almost immediately, without explaining exactly how.
?I have a message for all of you. The crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon ? and I mean very soon ? come to an end,? Trump said. After he is inaugurated as president next January, Trump said, ?Safety will be restored.?
Trump?s speech laid out stark differences between his agenda and that of presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. He asserted that the likely Democratic nominee was a ?puppet? of corporations and elites, and that she would ?keep our rigged system in place.?
At one point, the crowd chanted ?Lock her up!? Trump shook his head no, and responded, ?Let?s defeat her in November.?
The convention crowd cheered Trump?s applause lines, and booed when he mentioned upticks in homicides, and crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. As Trump described a surge in illegal immigration, the crowd broke out into ?Build that wall! Build that wall!?
Trump was introduced by his daughter Ivanka, who told the crowd that as a ?proud millennial, I do not consider myself categorically Republican or Democrat.?
?Sometimes, it?s a tough choice,? Ivanka Trump said. ?That is not the case this time.?
Ivanka Trump also endorsed an idea that Democratic candidates have focused on this year ?using the government to make it easier for mothers to return to the workforce. ?As president, my father will change the labor laws that will put in place at a time,? Ivanka Trump said, referring to her own experience as a mother of three. ?He will focus on making quality child care affordable and accessible for all.?
Ivanka Trump?s speech was remarkably more upbeat than the dire speech her father was set to give after her. She talked about towers built, jobs created ? images of success, which would be juxtaposed by her father?s vdismal vision of the world beyond his own business.
?Come January 17, all things will be possible again,? Ivanka Trump said.
Earlier, Silicon Valley mogul Peter Thiel offered a tech-focused version of Trump?s pessimistic critique, saying that U.S. government systems were hopelessly outmoded, with nuclear missile systems still run on ancient floppy disks.
?That is a staggering decline, for the country that completed the Manhattan project. We don?t accept such incompetence in Silicon Valley, and we must not accept it from our government,? Thiel said.
Thiel also offered a sharp critique of a policy fight that many Republicans have embraced, over rules requiring transgender people to use the bathroom that corresponds with their birth gender. In several states this year, social conservatives have fought bitterly to keep these rules.
Thiel said that was a mistake. ?This is a distraction from our real problems. Who cares??
He also said he was proud to be a gay American, a message that the convention crowd cheered, and met with chants of ?USA.?
Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, portrayed the GOP -- now changing at lightning speed to fit Trump?s vision ? as the only party changing fast enough.
?The dirty little secret Democrats don?t want you to know is they?re the same old party, doing the same old thing,? Priebus said. ?We are the party of new ideas, in a changing and faster world.?
Priebus also prompted the crowd into another round of this convention?s signature chant, which refers to Clinton?s use of a private email server to do government business. The Justice Department declined to prosecute Clinton, but the FBI director said her actions had been ?extremely careless.?
?She has spent the last 16 months looking into the eyes of the American people and lying,? Priebus said. ?She lied! And she lied over and over and over and over. She lied!
?Lock her up!? the crowd responded. ?Lock her up!?
Jerry Falwell Jr., the son of the famous evangelist and the president of Virginia?s Liberty University, described Trump as a ?blue-collar billionaire.?
?We are at a crossroads, where our first priority must be saving our nation,? Falwell said, foreshadowing the somber tone of Trump?s coming speech. He told the crowd that a decision to not vote, or to vote for a third-party candidate, was a de facto vote for Clinton. Falwell said that, were Clinton able to appoint new liberal justices to the Supreme Court, the consequences could be devastating: ?A fatal blow to our republic.? He did not explain exactly how the court would bring that disaster.
Falwell also recalled a joke told by his father, Jerry Falwell Sr., in which the elder Falwell dreamed that he told Chelsea Clinton ? daughter of Hillary ? that the three greatest threats to America were ?Osama, Obama and Yo? Mama,? Falwell said.
?Well, Osama is now gone,? he said, meaning Osama bin Laden. ?Obama has six months left in his term. And the only way to make America great and one again is to tell Chelsea?s mama, ?You?re fired.??
Mark Burns, a South Carolina pastor who supports Trump, gave a raucous, revival-style speech, in which he led the crowd in shouting ?All lives matter!? -- a rejoinder to the Black Lives Matter movement. ?All lives matter!? the crowd shouted.
?Let ?em know!? Burns said.
?All lives matter!?
?Push it!? Burns said.
He finished by leading the crowd in another yell. ?Shout! Truuuuuump!? Burns said.
Burns drew attention during the primary campaign when he said that Democratic contender Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is Jewish, ?gotta get saved, gotta meet Jesus.?
Other convention speakers have largely avoided talking about one of Trump?s most important - -and controversial ? policy ideas, the construction of a wall on the southern border. But Maricopa County, Ariz. Sheriff Joe Arpaio, an outspoken critic of immigration policies, mentioned the plan in his address Thursday: ?Donald Trump will build the wall!?
The crowd immediately started a chant, interrupting Arpaio: ?Build that wall! Build that wall!?
Trump?s acceptance speech, the culmination of the evening, will offer a chance to unify a convention that ? so far ? has seemed stuck halfway between the old party that he shook up, and a new party that has been remade in Trump?s outsider image.
Speakers have extolled the value of overseas alliances; offstage, Trump told the New York Times he might not defend NATO allies from invasion. And the big ideas that brought Trump success on the campaign trail ? a border wall, mass deportation of undocumented immigrants, a temporary ban on Muslim immigration ? have received little attention from most speakers.
In one sign of the discordant messages of Trump?s convention, a speech on Thursday night by Anthony Perkins of the Family Research Council ? a leading voice for Christian morals in public life -- was followed, a few minutes later, by the house band playing AC/DC?s ?You Shook Me All Night Long.?
Cruz?s speech on Wednesday smashed attempts by many Republican leaders to present a united party capable of taking on the Democrats in November. And it significantly distracted efforts to appeal to persuadable voters. (Washington Post)

It roughly suggests that 1 out of every 7 members of the population are logging onto?Facebook Messenger each month to text with friends and family.Facebook also released some stats related to its messaging service.

A few of Facebook Messenger's wellreceived?features like?sticker packs, money?payments, and easilyshareable?GIFs will?be making their debut in the new iOS 10?Messages app this fall.WhatsApp, the messaging app Facebook acquired for $22 billion in 2014, reached the same?number of users in February, while popular Chinese messaging app WeChat has 762 million?users and LINE has 218.4 million.

Govt. would remain for five years: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe asserted yesterday in Parliament the current rule would serve for another five years under the concept of the national unity government.
The Prime Minister, making a statement to the House on the progress of his two-day visit to Singapore early this week, said nobody should have an iota of doubt about it.
"The present national unity government will remain for five more years. There is no doubt about it," he said.
While making his remarks on the projects outlined for the implementation during the period, he even invited Joint Opposition MP Geetha Kumarasinghe to join the government for the remaining period.
He said he would develop tourism zones in the south and asked Ms. Kumarasinghe, as an MP from the area, to join hands with the government.
"Whatever allegation is made, the President and I only intend to ensure a prosperous future for posterity," he said.
Commenting on his visit to Singapore and engagements with its leaders, he said he briefed them about his plan to develop Sri Lanka as a trading hub of the region and upgrade infrastructure in aviation, shipping, energy and communication.
"I briefed them about my plan to create one million job opportunities and a robust middle class. I also apprised them of the proposed Kandy, Colombo and Hambantota economic corridor, the Megapolis plan and the proposed tourism promotion zones in the southern province," he said.
The Prime Minister said investments exceeding 40 billion US Dollars were needed for the Megapolis project and another 10 billion US Dollars for the investments in the Hambantota economic zone.
"This is the largest economic development project in the region. I compare it to the Delhi- Mumbai economic zone," he said. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)

The Malaysian Government will study Sime Darby Group Bhd?s request to bring in workers from Sri Lanka to work in the plantation sector, says Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi.
He said Malaysia would also look into a request by Sri Lanka to send more of its skilled and semi-skilled workers.
?Sime Darby has asked for 5,000 workers from Sri Lanka to work in its plantations.
?Both countries will have to study the legal aspects of the request and if approved, the workers will have to undergo training to understand Malaysian socio-cultural, communication and legal matters before they start working,? Dr Ahmad Zahid said yesterday after meeting with Sri Lanka?s Minister of Foreign Employ?ment Thalatha Atukorale and Minister of Home Affairs Vajira Abeywar?dena.
Dr Ahmad Zahid is on a two-day official visit to Sri Lanka.
To a question, he said there were currently 6,500 Sri Lankan workers being employed in the manufacturing, services and maid sectors.
The meeting also discussed Sri Lanka?s request to allow its students to be issued with long-term student visas.
There are now 1,200 Sri Lankan students in Malaysian institutions.
?We have to study this as there are students from other countries studying in Malaysia and there is a need to look into the security and legal aspects,? he added.

SL invites diaspora to make submissions for reconciliation
	
Sri Lanka has invited the diaspora groups, including Tamils, to make submissions for advancing the task of reconciliation following the country's three-decade-long civil war that ended in 2009, PTI reported today.
The Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms (CTF) through the Sri Lankan embassy in Washington has called for submissions from diaspora organisations on the design of structures, processes and measures for truth, accountability, reparations and non-recurrence.
The diaspora can make submissions on Office on Missing Persons, an Office on Reparations, a Judicial Mechanism with a Special Counsel, a Truth, Justice, Reconciliation and Non-Recurrence Commission and any other mechanisms, processes or measures for advancing reconciliation.
The submissions can be made until July 28.
These mechanisms will be evolved through a process of wide consultations involving all stakeholders, including victims, the notice said.
The Tamil diaspora groups in the West were generally regarded as sympathisers of the LTTE during the armed separatist conflict.
The report of the CTF will be handed over to the government at the conclusion of the consultation process.
"It is expected that the Report, upon conclusion of consultations in August 2016, will be handed over in September 2016,? the notice said.
The government has already noticed parliament on the Office of Missing Persons which has been criticised by the Sinhala majority nationalists as a move to betray the government troops who defeated the LTTE.

SL plan to close down Jaffna?s IDP camps next month
	
Sri Lanka government is contemplating closing down all 31 camps of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the Jaffna district of the Northern Province and completing resettlement of 971 IDP families by August 15.
An official document, a copy of which is available with The Hindu, refers to the government?s plan.? But, enquiries with sources reveal that 204 houses are being built in Palaly and Kankesanthurai with the help of the Sri Lanka Army.? When asked by The Hindu, D.M. Swaminathan, Resettlement Minister, asserts that there is no such timeframe to close down the camps. But, he says that ?we are doing all what we can.?
The government?s move follows a direction given by President Maithripala Sirisena while chairing a high-level meeting last month on the resettlement of IDPs. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake were among those who attended the meeting. In December last, when the President visited an IDP camp in Konapulam, near Kankesanthurai, he assured people that he would address their problems in six months.
On Wednesday, the Cabinet of the Sri Lanka government gave an approval for LKR 971 million to build houses at a unit cost of Rs. one million.
While the 204 houses are expected to be ready in a few months, the sources say that the identification of land is under way to take care of the requirements of the remaining 767 families.
Finding fault with the manner in which the government is seeking to solve problems of the IDPs, Arunachalam Kunabalasingham, president of the Vali North Rehabilitation and Resettlement Committee, a body representing IDPs, says a large number of the IDPs is from places such as Myladdy and there is a 12-km-long coastline still under the control of the security forces. ?Without returning the Myladdy fishing harbour and providing free access to the coastline, the government will not be able to achieve much.?? Excluding the landless 641 families, the remaining families were once landowners, who should be given back their original lands, says Mr. Kunabalasingham.
C.V. Wigneswaran, Chief Minister of the Northern Province, addressing the Provincial Council on Thursday, blamed the Centre for not taking into confidence the provincial administration on matters concerning resettlement.

SL to release 73 Indian fishermen
	
At least 73 Indian fishermen held by Sri Lanka for allegedly fishing in their waters will be released, Fisheries Ministry Officials said today.
The ministry has made the necessary recommendations for the release of the fishermen following interventions by the Indian High Commission, officials said without indicating when they would be freed.
They had been held for allegedly poaching in violation of the Sri Lankan side of International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) between July 6-21.
Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amarasweera had yesterday said that none of the Indian boats would be released despite the release of the fishermen.
He has also denied reports that it would allow restricted fishing in the Sri Lankan waters as part of the measures to counter bottom trawling by the Indians.
Amaraweera said any decision in this connection would be reached only after consulting the local fisher community who are aggrieved by the constant poaching by Indians in Lankan waters. (NDTV)
