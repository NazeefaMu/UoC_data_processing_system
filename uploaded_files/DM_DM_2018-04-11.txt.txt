Fare meters for three-wheelers compulsory after April 30
	
All three-wheeler taxis should be fitted with meters by April 30, National Council for Road Safety (NCRF) Chairman Dr Sisira Kodagoda said.
The three-wheel taxis must also issue a printed bill to the passengers for their fare indicating the distance, fare and taxi details from April 30.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, he said a six-month grace period had been given for the three-wheeler owners to fix their meters.
The six-month grace period expired on April 1 and the law had to be implemented from that day. But considering the difficulties, the grace period was extended till the end of this month, he said.
After April 30, the law would be strictly implemented and stern legal action will be taken against the passenger transport three-wheelers for not having fare meters, he said.
He said that the taxi meter manufacturers had been advised to build their meters according to the standards stipulated by the Transport Ministry.
The taxi meters manufacturers should manufacture according to SLS standards. We cannot interfere with the manufacturing process but the meters should be made according to the given specifications, Dr Kodagoda said.
The maximum cost for a meter should be less than Rs.10, 000 and the meters should be provided to three-wheeler drivers under several instalments, if they couldnt pay the full amount upfront, he said.
He said the law was not to exploit three-wheeler drivers but to regulate their service, he said.
He said that the Traffic Police had been advised to arrest errant taxi drivers and a fine would be imposed on them.
Out of the total of 1,150,000 three-wheelers in the country, only 750,000 three-wheelers serve as passenger taxis. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Form UNP Govt. to end political crisis- Keerthi Tennakoon
	
As Sri Lanka was confronted with a huge political crisis, it should form a Government comprising one party, the United National Party (UNP), Campaign For Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) Executive Director Keerthi Tennakoon said.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, he said as the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) did not have the Parliamentary majority, the UNP had the potential to form a new Government and find solutions independently.
Confrontations can be seen within the Government due to the coalition Government. It was evident from the recent No Confidence Motion (NCM) against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe that it was impossible to run a Unity Government.
There are no proper consensuses within the Government. Two parties have incompatible ideas. This cant go on in this manner. The incumbent Government is not stable. Therefore, we are in a position to say that a Government consisting of one party is necessary to the country, Tennakoon said.
He said the Unity Government had created the atmosphere for the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) to support the Government.
The TNA, the official Opposition should act its due role as the Opposition party rather than extending its consent to anything done by the Government, he added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

GMOA wants fresh laws to curb import of Glyphosate
	
While urging the Government to continue with the ban on Glyphosate, the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today said fresh laws should be introduced to take stern action against people involved in smuggling in such harmful chemicals.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr Nalinda Herath told a news conference that the Customs had today apprehended a consignment of illegally imported Glyphosate which was a banned weedicide in the country.
Dr Herath said todays incident was reported to be the third consignment of Glyphosate seized by the Customs in the last few months.
He added that the importers were engaging in these activities deceiving the Customs.
It is reported that Glyphosate was imported declaring as Dolomite. The Customs had discovered Glyphosate whereas there is another chemical which had still not been identified, he said.
He said the people who found guilty of importing Glyphosate were released by the authorities for lesser fines and added that stern legal action should be taken to penalize them.
He also said accordingly fresh laws should be introduced.
The Government had taken an appreciable policy decision to ban Glyphosate. Despite some Government Ministers requests to lift the ban, the Government should continue with it, he said.
He also said Glyphosate was a causative factor in non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in the country and added that they would be willing to meet President Maithripala Sirisena to discuss the issue and to request to continue with the ban. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Gripped by the Fear of Crime
	
Bloodshed became a common occurrence with the 30-year ethnic conflict that ravaged the island. However, eight years after the war has ceased, the local gun culture still exists. Since January 2018, Sri Lanka has experienced the heat of the underworld with several incidents being reported in Colombo and the greater Colombo areas. Shootings among rival factions to gain territorial monopoly over narcotics and businesses such as sand mining is now common in the country.
As much as dealing with weapons has become a lucrative business, the 30-year conflict too has contributed to this influx of weapons used in the underworld. The Special Task Force, affiliated to the Police, has taken an upper hand in controlling this menace and so far has been successful in taking several noted criminals into custody and for further questioning. 
Hence, the Daily Mirror spoke to a few individuals of varied expertise in an attempt to shed light on factors that have contributed to this menace and certain penal provisions described in the Firearms Ordinance. 
A country flooded with arms
In an interview with the Daily Mirror, Major General Udaya Perera, ex-Director Operations of the Sri Lanka Army and the ex-Security Forces Commander in Kilinochchi and Jaffna said that this situation is common in any country that has faced turmoil like Sri Lanka. We were a country that was challenged by a hybrid terrorist organization. They collected huge amounts of money to buy war-like equipment; from these small arms were the majority and they were able to buy them from around the world and from corrupt Government officers of other countries. They also captured arms from the Sri Lankan and Indian military. So they had a large arms capturing system,said Perera. 
Secondly when we were fighting the war, the Government of Sri Lanka in good faith gave some arms to border villages, he continued. During the war we saw a large number of illegal weapons in the country; in fact every weapon used by the LTTE was illegal. Naturally the country was flooded with small arms of various types. Even before the LTTE era, such as during the JVP riots, they also had locally manufactured weapons etc.
So these weapons were freely available and I dont think anybody has a record of this. We were fighting with a non-state actor who wasnt adhering to universally accepted rules and regulations, so there were no registers. Therefore the guns were freely available and even today there may be arms catchers who may have hidden their weapons under rooftops, ceilings, water tanks and other places. The weapon business is a lucrative one and due to economic reasons people are tempted to sell weapons and get some extra money. With this environment it is a natural phenomenon and handling this situation is an issue, he stressed. 
Securitisation as a solution
According to Maj. Gen. Perera the country should have a short, medium and a long-term plan to handle this situation. Sri Lanka is a country where we have all the agencies in place, he said. The issue is how to bring these agencies together through a coordinated effort. We did that beautifully to defeat terrorism and when an issue of this nature emerges its a threat to national security. Generally there is a concept known as securitisation; similarly to how we securitized the entire country, agencies and line ministries to defeat terrorism, during a conflict like this it is important to securitize the issue as well as the agencies. As for a short term plan we have to give incentives, which we have done a couple of times so that these guns can be surrendered and people can come out and give information.
But all the weapons cannot be taken through this approach. Therefore there has to be a medium term plan where you bring in all the agencies on a coordinated fashion. Here, the intelligence agencies have a huge role to play. They should be strengthened to obtain information regarding these types of weapons because it is a security threat. Then other agencies such as line ministries, military and the Police should be brought in to fight this menace. In a country like this the society too should be linked to this process. We are hugely influenced by the clergy of Sri Lanka, irrespective of religion. They work in groups and they too should be linked because theres a morality factor associated,he said.
Role of academics and think tanks
In the case of US theres a huge difference, he further added. In the US the weapons are legalized and when they start killing innocent civilians, the society comes together as one and they are vociferously involved in anti-gun culture activity. But in Sri Lanka the society would not come forward because they dont target innocent people here. The targets are rival factions and the society is evasive, silent and turns a blind eye to such incidents. The Government has to be effective and get the society involved. But in this situation, violence shouldnt be seen in the governing sector. The long-term solution in terms of securitization is the role that has to be played by think tanks and academics. In the West, think tanks such as the Institute for National Security Studies and universities are encouraged to do research. Up to now I have not seen any research being done on this sector.
Therefore research needs to be done on how we could control this situation and the Government too has to be involved in this research. Here, we also need to get the non-state actor involved because its registers are not with us and therefore we need to do a proper assessment and see how many weapons were actually there in Sri Lanka. Each weapon which was there with the non-state actor is an illegal one and we also have to see how many weapons the Government had distributed in good faith in order to safeguard the lives of the people. Generally we believe that there are around 850 million weapons in the possession of people in this world. Out of that about 600 million weapons are possessed by civilians. These numbers are increasing daily and in our country too there has to be a fair number due to the conflict, he underscored. 
Threat to the economy
If this issue isnt resolved, it would remain as it is. The economy also has a role in national security, said a concerned Perera. When we talk about security it isnt only about the military, the Police and the judiciary. The economy, environmental, communication and societal sectors too have an active role to play in terms of national security. If the economy is stable, the rate of crime will drop. We are a small country and need to have a system of identification for every citizen. Security could be tightened to such a level, so that every citizen should be responsible and the intelligence services should be able to monitor all citizens without any hindrance and without disturbing their privacy.
Security is very important for a country to develop. If banks are being robbed and people are killed on the street then investors would desist from investing in the country. When theres a conflict with a non-state actor, nothing is recorded and this is done on purpose. Other sectors revolve around security and it should be encouraged at an academic level as well. Think tanks should also do research on the subject. This is why I said that the Government should securitise the issue. In good governance you need to have a coordinated effort between agencies and these agencies should know what each other is doing. This is usually done in other countries by the National Security Council and its secretariat, he added. 
In his concluding remarks, Maj. Gen. Perera said that Sri Lanka is not a banana state. It has all the agencies in place. If we didnt have that coordination we may not have defeated the LTTE. Our intelligence and other agencies should be strengthened to such a level that they should be motivated to have innovative and coordinated action. Bureaucrats should be professional and they should be decision-makers. This is not a difficult task in Sri Lanka. If the military community is made vulnerable there are extremist elements that would be there to grab and take them to their side. Therefore the Government should always keep the military with it and this is how the larger military community should be managed,he explained. 
All people killed in recent shootings were noted criminals: STF
In his comments to the Daily Mirror, a senior official attached to the Special Task Force said that so far 19 incidents have been reported. The last shooting took place in Maligawatte and we have been able to solve four cases already. Suspects seem to be evading arrest and we have organized our teams to do mobile day and night patrolling in Colombo and the greater Colombo area. During our search operations we have been able to take in more than 16 noted criminals for questioning and have also recovered several weapons and narcotics including heroin. After March 27 we havent seen any incidents, but we are continuing our operations, the official said. 
He further said that one significant highlight in these incidents was that all those who were killed were noted criminals. They all have had criminal records and most incidents are shootings between rival factions. They try to kill the other in businesses such as sand mining and gain territorial monopoly. This is the same in narcotics. The weapons used were those that were robbed and although there were 19 incidents only two to three weapons have been moved around. Search operations are currently underway and the STF is fighting to eradicate the fear of crime in the city, the official further said. 
An insight into the Firearms Ordinance
Presidents Counsel Tirantha Walaliyadde, who has appeared for cases involving Soththi Upali, Chinthaka Amarasinghe, Dhammika Amarasinghe and currently representing the person who is alleged to have shot Dhammika Amarasinghe inside the Magistrates Court Complex, explained certain deterrent penal provisions covering the illegal possession and the use of firearms in the Firearms Ordinance. The possession of an unlicensed gun entails a five-year jail term for a first offence and/or fine; for the second offence the penalty is ten to twenty years in jail. The possession of a repeater shotgun or an automatic gun provides a mandatory life sentence. The possession of a gal kattas entails a five thousand rupee fine and a second and subsequent offence, to ten years in jail and or/ rupees ten thousand fine. All these provisions also cover having custody of such a weapon as distinct from possession. Custody means control and not necessarily immediate possession. 
Speaking further Walaliyadde said that the use of a gun to commit offenses set out in Schedule C and D entails a life sentences and fines or fifteen years and fine respectively. Therefore, anyone who keeps a gun in his premises or possession on behalf of another runs the risk of prosecution for possession. The burden of proving that the gun is licensed is on the person who is charged for possessing a weapon. This is so with other activities requiring licenses. In cases where life sentences are prescribed bail can only be granted by the High Court under exceptional circumstances. 
A Peace Officer includes any police officer and any Grama Niladhari appointed to perform police duties. Any peace officer, Grama Niladhari, or any revenue or judicial officer, or any other Government officer authorized in writing by a Superintendent of Police may arrest without a warrant any person possessing, carrying, or using an unlicensed gun. Any SSP or other officer authorized by him in writing or any Grama Niladhari or peace officer may enter and search all premises of any person suspected of possessing, making, selling, or repairing guns without a license. This includes any vessel, boat or conveyance. In a nutshell any person entitled to or authorized can search any person suspected of possessing unlicensed guns, or enter and search any premises or vehicle suspected to contain unlicensed guns and take the guns into custody and arrest without warrant any person connected thereto, he said.
According to Walaliyadde, the assembling of any parts to form a gun comes under manufacturing of guns. The importation, manufacture, possession, repair, sale, transfer of a gun can only be done by virtue of a license issued by the Defence Secretary. If not, the culprit is guilty of an offence and is liable to the respective penalties and punishments as prescribed in the Act. Proof of license is on the person charged. The guns concerned in any offence under the Firearms Act are liable to confiscation subject to the owners claim of bona fides if the offence is committed by someone else. The sale of cartridges is also prohibited unless the purchaser produces a valid gun license, he said. 
The above contents are simplified explanations of the Firearms Act and its practical aspects as relevant to the present day crime trend and are not meant to be quoted in any court of law. However, this article does not cover the entirety of the Act. In his concluding remarks, Walaliyadde said,
As another matter of comment, it is my considered view that the only way to curb and deter this spate of underworld violence presently scorching the country is to reactivate the death sentence following a review of the conviction by the Supreme Court, where contract killings are concerned.

Gun toting papas marching as to war
	
Do those who got their marching orders from the UNP some years ago, and thus are no longer members of the party have any right to hold protests or marches, to try to get rid of a Leader who has been duly elected to the position byhis party
If the protest was as it was said to be, a peaceful one, why the need to carry guns and long cinnamon poles The excuse for the poles was that they were to be used as flagpoles, but apparently there were no flags foundwith them.
The organizer seems to specialize in marches if nothing else as I think this is the third one he has tried to do. We have seen in our political history, what has happened to people who tried to run too fast and tried to oust elected leaders.
Using guns, it appears, seems to run in the genes of some, when we recall some past protests and those who were caught by camera carrying and threatening people with guns.
After a lot of boasting and arrogant talk this group got only around 0.1% of the vote at the recent LocalGovernment Elections.
One cannot fool all the people all the time! That too, is a lesson of history.
No right-thinking citizen with a love for the country will indulge in this kind of behaviour. I fail to comprehend why this march was allowed to proceed after the guns and poleswere found
Provoking people, inciting people is part of rabble rousing, which can cause violence and make it spread. Our country can hardly afford this kind of loss to the economy, which causes instability, a lack of investment and hinders tourism.
No right-thinking citizen with a love for the country will indulge in this kind of behaviour. I fail to comprehend why this march was allowed to proceed after the guns and poleswere found.
What has the new Minister of Law and Order done about it Had Field Marshall Fonseka been there, Im sure it would have been a different story!
As a Christian, I cannot understand how people take their hatred so far as to go on and on hurling slander at a person. There has to be something in their own lives, perhaps even stemming from an unhappy childhood to make them act like this. It can be a broken home, neglect or abuse, it is difficult for us who came from secure happy homes and a cosseted childhood tounderstand this.
Traumas of an unhappy childhood can I guess, cloud ones entire life.
I never watch television but I know that the majority of my friends switch off their TV sets when this kind of slander is used time and again against one man, who is respected and revered, both here and far beyondour shores.
People who act like this should turn the searchlight within and find out why hatred consumes so much of their time and thought, together with an extraordinary instinctfor intrigue.
This attitude is bad and brittle leading to assertive opportunism.
Treachery of this sort usually erodes the foundation of trust, one who does this to one, can do the same thing to another and is rarely trusted by anyone.
What has the new Minister of Law and Order done about it Had Field Marshall Fonseka been there, Im sure it would have been adifferent story!

While ambition and hunger remain not assuaged, the desire for violence and crime will remain and bring suffering and destruction in its wake.
People who indulge in this kind of irascible opinionated behaviour give the impression thatsociety today.
Epitomizes the dishonest, self-seeking snatch and grab winner takes it all mentality, depriving the country of all ethical values.
Their lives have probably been strewn with broken dreams, failed relationships, disappointing outcomes and broken promises from childhood on, which they now take out by venting their anger on another.
There is, however, a God above and those who hurl abuse and organize protests against Ranil will be dealt with one day in the not too distant future.
Vengeance is mine said the Lord, I will repay. White vans would have dealt with them if they had dared to do this during thepast regime.
People who act like this should turn the searchlight within and find out why hatred consumes so much of their time and thought, together with an extraordinary instinct for intrigue.
There is no other politician today, as mentioned by some Buddhist clergy on the electronic media recently, whose family has contributed so much to Buddhism and the country asRanils ancestors.
These words of John Buchan seem apt to describe Ranil.
He disliked emotion, not because he felt lightly but because he felt deeply. He loved his country. Austerely, self-respectingly, he had been used to hide his devotion under a mask of indifference and would never reveal them except in deeds. To him politics was still the greatest and most honourable adventure. Our roll of honour is long but it holds no nobler figure.

Jeyaraj was always on the side of the people
	
Sri Lanka was embroiled in a civil war for nearly three decades during which Sri Lanka lost most of its leaders including security forces personnel, state officials, politicians and civilians.
One of the them was the well-known politician former minister Jeyaraj Fernandopulle who was assassinated on April 6, 2008 when he was attending a marathon as the Chief Guest at Weliveriya in the Gampaha district. A suicide bomber blew himself targeting Mr. Fernandopulle. Fifteen others were killed and some 100 injured. Jeyaraj had his primary education at Ave Maria Convent and the secondary education at Maris Stella College in Negombo. He showed leadership qualities since his childhood and became the head prefect of Maris Stella College. He entered Law College in 1974 and passed out as an attorney-at-law in 1977. 
He was made Katana SLFP organizer in 1984. He first won from the Gampaha district in the polls of 1989 and was elected to Parliament. Since then, he had 20 years of experience as a Member of Parliament and at various times was minister of Plan Implementation and Parliamentary Affairs, Trade, Commerce, Consumer Affairs and Marketing Development, Highways and Road Development. He was also the treasurer of the SLFP. 
Because of his fluency in Sinhala, English and Tamil, he had an outstanding career in Parliament and was a regular orator who raised his voice against injustice and corruption and was difficult to keep out of speaking. Nevertheless, he was one of the chief representatives of the Peace Negotiation Discussions with the LTTE and he spoke fearlessly against anti-terrorism. 
He had his talent to garner people into his attraction. He always used that for the well being of the general public. He had an amiable character using every opportunity to move with people. Moreover, it is said that since he was so close to the people, he had to undergo a critical period at the end of his life and was finally dragged to death. Nowadays, we hardly find such people in Sri Lankan politics. 
The 10th death anniversary of this veteran politician Jeyaraj Fernandopulle was commemorated at the Jeyaraj Fernandopulle memorial statue in Weliveriya on Friday under the patronage of Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, Nimal Siripala de Silva.
The memorial oration was delivered by Most Ven. Agga Maha Panditha Kotugoda Dhammawasa Nayaka Thera.
State Minister of City Planning and Water Supply Sudarshani Fernandopulle, the wife of the late Jeyaraj Fernandopulle and several others paid floral tributes at the Jeyaraj Fernandopulle memorial statue in Weliveriya. Many charitable programmes like almsgivings and Eucharistic celebrations and Bodhi Poojas were organized throughout the Gampaha district to mark the death anniversary.
Jeyaraj Fernandopulle was that kind of a person whose memories and works cant be forgotten. We wish that he would attain eternal happiness in heaven.

JVP to launch massive protest campaign for pay hike
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today it would launch a massive work stoppage and protest campaign after the May Day to secure a salary increase for public and private sector employees and against the scrapping of the pension.
JVP Politburo member K.D. Lal Kantha told a news conference that the cost of living of a family had risen by Rs.6,000 rupees a month after the present government came into power.
JVP general secretary Tilvin Silva said the JVP had planned to hold its May Day parade and the rally in Jaffna on May 1 so that the Vesak festival would not be obstructed.
No one can postpone May Day. But we accept the fact that there is a practical difficulty in organizing the May Day parade and the rally in Colombo on May 1 due to Vesak celebrations. We will hold our rally on May 1 in Jaffna and the main rally in Colombo on May 7 with a participation of more than 5 million people, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

However, the group of 16 will remain in the SLFP as a separate independent group under President Sirisena in and out of Parliament and will not join the SLPP or the Joint Opposition, he said.
Addressing the weekly Cabinet news briefing yesterday, Minister Senaratne said he hoped that the inter-party and intraparty squabbles in the UNP and the SLFP would come to an end as the Yahapalana Government was determined to launch a new journey with a new Cabinet and a new work plan.
There will be changes when allocating portfolios to Ministers in the new Cabinet as President Sirisena is to follow a more pragmatic and scientific method when Cabinet portfolios are allocated. For instance, there will be no portfolio of Higher Education and Highways, he noted.
Secretary to President Austin Fernando and Secretary to Prime Minister Saman Ekanayake are attending to the allocation of portfolios in the new Cabinet on the instructions President Sirisena, Minister Senaratne said.
Responding to a journalist, Minister Senaratne said if a Cabinet Minister who supported the NCM wanted to remain in the Cabinet he or she would have to express regret and make a full confession to the Government to be considered whether to accept it and give a Cabinet post.
The Yahapalana Government consists of 148 members from the UNP and the SLFP and therefore, it needs only three more members to have a two-thirds majority, he said.
Minister Senaratne said Ministry Secretaries would submit tender of resignations enabling President Sirisena to appoint Secretaries afresh to Ministries in the new Cabinet.
Answering to another question, Minister Senaratne said it was likely that Parliament would elect a new Deputy Speaker also replacing incumbent Thilanga Sumathipala at the first session of Parliament after the New Year.
If the Parliament was dissolved soon after the 2015 Presidential Poll, the UNP would have achieved a landslide victory with a two-thirds majority but it was Prime Minister Wickremesinghe who proposed to President Sirisena to form a Unity Government with the SLFP.
Basil was in the US and Mahinda was in Carlton at Tangalle licking the wounds of defeat, Dr Senaratne said.
It was because of the magnanimous gesture and statesmanship of Premier Wickremesinghe that led to the forming the Yahapalana Government with the SLFP as a partner.
Unfortunately many in the SLFP have forgotten this, Minister Senaratne lamented.
If the LG Polls were also announced in the euphoria of election victory, the UNP would have been the absolute winner but Prime Minister Wickremesinghe wanted to form a common front to face the domestic and global issues.
The foreign debts were escalating to unprecedented heights to trillions of rupees, the allegations of war crimes and human rights violations were gathering momentum in the global community. The UNHRC was in the process of passing resolutions against Sri Lanka.
The economy was in tatters and prices of essential commodities were unbearable. It was because of these calamities that Prime Minister Wickremesinghe wanted a unity government, Minister Senaratne said.
Ministers Susil Premajayantha, John Seneviratne, S.B. Dissanayake, Anura Priyadharshana Yapa, Chandima Weerakkody and Dayasiri Jayasekera were among the 16 SLFP Ministers, State and Deputies who voted in favour of the NFM (Sandun A Jayasekera)

None of us wants to cling to our posts: Chandima
	
In the aftermath of the unsuccessful No-Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe by the Joint Opposition, the Daily Mirror spoke to Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Chandima Weerakkody, who supported the motion, on the repercussions of the NCM in the Unity Government, in the JO and in the breakaway group of the SLFP.
EXCERPTS:
The LG polls results remain in the domestic political arena to identify the thinking pattern of voters.
	We are going to discuss this issue in the Central Committee on Monday andI hope we can have a, clear picture
	The Employment Linked Training Purchase (ELTP) project launched last year has already expanded to 21 private establishments and trained 1,278 youths
Q The UNP says that the Joint Opposition suffered a major setback with the defeat of the No-Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Do you agree
You will have to ask this question from the Joint Opposition as we have nothing to do with it. We in the SLFP are not in cahoots with the JO because we are the members of the SLFP under our leader President Maithripala Sirisena.
But we voted in favour of the No-Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe simply because the allegations contained in the NCM were in line with our policies and fight against corruptions. You know that 13 out of 14 allegations against Prime Minister were related to Central Bank bond scam. You may remember that it was General Secretary of the UPFA, Minister Mahinda Amaraweera who lodged the complaint to the Bribery Commission in 2016 on the bond scam. Therefore, we voted for the motion and were able to create a big split in the UNP over the issue.
Q Based on the SLPPs argument that the peoples mandate given to President Maithripala Sirisena and the UNF in the Presidential and Parliamentary polls in 2015 was negated after the huge victory by the SLPP at the LG polls this year, the UNP now says that the February 10 LG polls victory of the SLPP also got invalidated with the defeat of the NCM. What do you have to say
Technically, President Maithripala Sirisena was elected the Executive President by over 6.2 million people in the country for 6 years in January 2015 and later the term of office of the President restricted to five years under the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. As such, the mandate given to President Sirisena in January 2015 will run up to January 2021 and that cannot be changed in a political or Constitutional manoeuvring. His five-year mandate as President expires only in January 2020. The LG polls results remain in the domestic political arena to identify the thinking pattern of the people. Yes, the SLPP recorded a comprehensive victory on January 10 but that does not invalidate the mandate given to President Sirisena or the limited mandate given to the UNP and the SLFP in Parliamentary polls held in August 2015.
Dont forget that we are a Parliamentary democracy. This is the policy followed by any other democracy on mid-term election results. I would like to remind you of a universally accepted policy in a participatory democracy that requires that the incumbent Government must review its policy and introduce necessary changes in governance if and when it gets beaten in a mid-term poll, be it a local Government poll or a by-election.
Q The UNPs victory margin is significant with a majority of 46 votes. Your comments
I dont think so. But, yes, the NCM was beaten with a 46 vote majority. At the same time, you must keep in mind that there were 102 out of 224 who did not support Prime Minister in the 225 Parliament with Speaker taking no side. I think the biggest achievement for the JO is the snatching the two-thirds majority away from the UNP led Unity Government which they thought they enjoyed.
There are also other controversial and secretive factors that have led to the defeat of the NCM.
I dont want to comment further on these issues but I think they will come to open before long after the euphoria of the victory evaporates.
Q Why the 16 SLFP Ministers, State and Deputy Ministers, still hang onto their posts after they voted in favour of the NCM
Not at all. None of us want to cling onto our posts. We are ready to leave our posts immediately after our party leader President Sirisena advises us to do so. We discussed the matter with him and he asked us not to take a hasty decision and remain in our posts because it was him who appoints us. We dont want to remain in our positions a minute further if and when President Sirisena asks us to leave.
The SLFP members consented to take up positions in the Yahapalana Government on the advice of the President Sirisena and approval of the Central Committee of the party. If we are to leave the Government the same procedure has to be followed. It is as simple as that.
Q The President appoints Ministers after discussing the portfolios with the Prime Minister. Can you all sit in a cabinet with Mr Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister
We, the SLFP members are a coalition partner and we are supposed to stick to the policies of the Unity Government. We try our best to conduct ourselves according to the policies of the Unity Government and most importantly to our conscious as long as we could. But in the current political situation in the country, you will have to act at the right time and at the right place.
Q Your grievance was that you could not support a Government any further if Mr Wickremesinghe remained as the PM. Now what
We voted in favour of the NCM based only on the allegations that had been levelled against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe on the Central Bank bond scam.
The SLFP Central Committee closely reviewed the recommendations of the 11 member Parliamentary Committee of the SLFP, headed by Minister and Senior Vice President Nimal Siripala De Silva. This committee was appointed by the party leader, President Sirisena on our request. Allegations in the NCM were almost based on the recommendations of this committee.
Therefore, it is quite obvious that we could not vote against the NCM. We have a duty and a responsibility to fulfil the aspirations of our voters and as such you will see we have no other option but to vote in favour of the NCM.
Q But, what about the self-respect, dignity and decency of those who are hanging onto their posts even after suffering a heavy defeat at the NCM debate
As I told you earlier, we are ready to leave our positions in the Government soon after the SLFP leader, President Sirisena asks us to do so. However, we are going to discuss this issue in the Central Committee on Monday and I hope we can have a clear picture on the fate of 16 SLFP Ministers, State Ministers and Deputy Ministers after that. Therefore, the issue of dignity or self-respect does not arise.
Q Your own colleagues in the Cabinet, who abstained from voting at the NCM, say that the real target of the NCM was President Maithripala Sirisena and not Mr Wickremesinghe. Your comments
Any one is free to read the Constitution. An Executive President cannot be removed with an NCM passed in Parliament and an NCM cannot be brought against an Executive President in the first place. It is very unfair, illogical and indecent to say that the NCM targeted President.
Q Whatever said and done and whatever positions were taken by political parties, the President and Prime Minister, dont you feel it is extremely difficult for the SLFP Ministers to cohabit with the UNP Ministers in the cabinet and all others members opposed to you in Parliament in governance
We challenge the proponents to go ahead with their NCM against us and take it in Parliament as early as possible. We also challenge them to form their own Government if possible. However, as I said earlier we leave the Government when President Sirisena and the Central Committee of the SLFP want us to do so.
Q Dont forget that the Yahapalana Government has more than two years more. Are you, with the support of the SLPP, attempting to snatch a Parliamentary or Presidential poll before 2020
Constitutionally, it is not possible as no one enjoys a two-thirds majority in Parliament now. President Sirisena has the power to dissolve Parliament only after February 2019. Lets wait and see what the Government, the UNP and the SLFP shape up for the most crucial elections scheduled to be held in 2020. I think you will be able to have an apprehension on the pattern of future domestic political shape up from the results of the forthcoming Provincial Council polls.
Q I feel you are not satisfied with your portfolio of Skills Development and Vocational Training. Am I right
No. I really enjoy my job as the Minister of Skills Development and Vocational Training because my Ministry is the State body that shapes the future of the millions of youth in the country.
For instance, the policy of my Ministry is to develop a culture whereas our youth dont go after employers or politicians to secure a job but to make them as a marketable asset in the job market with value-added qualifications.
They simply create a demand for themselves and in a position to bargain for their salary and other benefits when appearing before an interview board. The Employment Linked Training Purchase (ELTP) project launched last year has already expanded to 21 private establishments and trained 1,278 youths in construction, engineering and service sectors and another 586 have obtained highly paid jobs after training.

President takes a swipe at CBK
	
President Maithripala Sirisena is reported to have been critical of former president Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga over some remarks she made on the people's mandate at the presidential election on January 8, 2015.
At the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Central Committee meeting on Monday night, Ms. Kumaratunga had insisted that the party should remain in the government because that was in line with the people's mandate on January 8, 2015. Before leaving the meeting, she is also said to have been critical of the CC for not discussing the way forward on policy matters.
However, the President taking a swipe at her said people voted on January 8, 2015, not for a movement but for the person who gave leadership.
Otherwise, they could have nominated someone from the United National Party (UNP) but asked why that was not so, he questioned.
The President said Ms. Kumaratunga rarely attended the Central Committee meetings and as such had little or no knowledge about the discussions on policy matters. (Kelum Bandara)

The sixteen SLFP ministers who voted for the no-confidence motion against the prime minister decided to resign from their posts tonight and sit in the opposition when Parliament meets after the New Year celebrations.
Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa told the Daily Mirror that President Maithripala Sirisena had accepted their letters of resignation.
He said these 16 members would function as an SLFP group in the opposition.
Asked whether they would team up with the joint opposition, he said that question would not arise at the moment. "We will work as a separate group in Parliament," he said.
Meanwhile, State Minister of Public Enterprise Development Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said that it was not ethical for them to stay in the government anymore after voting against the Prime Minister. As public representatives elected by the people, we feel that we should leave the unity government in which we hold ministerial portfolios, the minister said.

Welikada shooting  incident unfolding in court
	
Prison Departments Rehabilitation Commissioner and Magazine Prisons former Superintendent Emil Ranjan Lamahewage and Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) Inspector Moses Rangajeewa Newamal are extolled as heroes by some groups in our society for their alleged involvement into the killing of 27 inmates in Welikada Prison on November 09 and 10, 2012. Certain groups justify the shooting, giving a reason that those who were killed were dangerous criminals and drug dealers.
Those who were killed were not innocent people. They deserved death because they were a menace to the society, they say. But, no one has a right to snatch another life. The 27 prisoners including those who were selected and shot at would not have died in vain, but they did. The furious manner in which the armed forces quelled the riot apparently indicated ferocity in the disposition of certain groups in our society towards prisoners.
Prisoners picked out and gunned down
IP Rangajeewa and former Prison Superintendent Emil Ranjan were arrested on March 28 and remanded till April 10. When the case was taken yesterday, they were further remanded till April 25. The CID investigations reports indicated that IP Rangajeewa and two others had entered Welikada Prison on the night of the incident, dressed in civil clothes, selected a group of prisoners and took them to another location. 
According to the CID investigations, eight of the detainees taken had been shot dead, which is a crime according to Articles 102, 111, 113, 189, 198, 296 and 355 of Paragraph 32 of the Penal Code. 
The eight prisoners who were gunned down were identified as Malindra Nilendra Palpola alias Malan, Nirmala Atapattu, Mohamed Wijaya Rohana alias Gundu Mama, Chinthamani Mohottige Thushara Chandana alias Kalu Thushara, Ponna Kapila alias Asarappulige Jothipala, Harsha Sri Manakeerthi Perera alias Manju Sri, Maali Susantha alias Raigamage Susantha Perera and Devamlamullage Malith Sameera Perera alias Konda Amila. 
Out of the 27 prisoners nine died during the shooting carried out by the STF when they allegedly tried to escape from a three-wheeler (GH3423). Two more prisoners died in the shooting when they attempted to escape near a Prison Superitednets residence. The other 8 inmates died during the shootout between armed forces and the inmates, who were bearing weapons. 
The CID investigations revealed, based on the evidence of witnesses, that a group of prisoners had been picked out and later shot on November 10th morning. This was after the Army had entered Welikada Prison later that night, brought the situation under control and left the scene. 
Sudesh Nandimal Silva, who was in remand when the riot took place, speaking to the Daily Mirror said that he had also seen an officer in yellow t-shirt, whom he later got to know as IP Rangajeewa, having in his possession a pistol and a list and calling out certain prisoners by their names. Nandimal has testified before the CID. 
Covering up the crime
Under the instructions of the then Prisons Commissioner General, the official photographer of Prisons Niraj Dushyantha Gunawardane had taken photographs of the dead prisoners and also captured the situation at the prison on November 10th morning. In those photographs, weapons were not seen near the bodies of prisoners Malan, Kapila and Manju Sri. However, a rifle was seen beside the bodies of the above mentioned prisoners in photographs which were taken later, the CID informed the court. 
All the weapons seized from the prisoners by the Army were handed over by Sergeant Tennakoon to Jailer Nanayakkara on November 10th morning as it was noted down in the journal. CID officers had found four T56 rifles next to the bodies of the prisoners. They were among the firearms which were earlier handed over to Jailer Nanayakkara. The CID concluded that the four rifles had been brought back and placed next to the bodies of prisoners with the intention of framing an incident or covering up a crime. 
All these findings by the CID were reported by the Daily Mirror in earlier articles using statements made by eyewitnesses, including prisoners and a jailer. 
The firearms and other productions of the case have been sent to the Government Analysts Department for further study and a further report on the CID findings have been sent to the Attorney Generals Department, seeking advice. 
Disputes with prisoners
It was also found that most of the inmates who had been picked out and shot were those who had filed Fundamental Rights cases and petitions before the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) against prison, narcotics and defence officials. 
Emil threatened my son to withdraw complaint against him at Human Rights Commission
- Merlin
During an interview with the Daily Mirror, Jayasinghe Arachchige Merlin, the mother of Devalamullage Malith Sameera Perera aka Konda Amila, who died during the shooting, recalled the history associating her son and Former Prison Superintendent Emil Ranjan at Magazine Prison. 
Malith was a convict of a drug related crime. He had been transferred to Welikada Prison several days prior to the shooting incident. 
The bodies of brutally shot prisoners were laid in order when Merlin visited the hospital to identify the remain of her son. The face of Malith was almost unrecognizable due to wounds. For a moment she sat breathless and was hardly able to believe her eyes. Then she recovered her senses and voice. She started crying for her son. 
My son earlier had had a verbal argument with Emil. Following the argument, Emil had summoned my son to his office and threatened to shoot him. Following this threat, I filed a complaint at the Human Rights Commission against him (Ranjan) over the death threat. Emil, who was infuriated, had punished and penalised my son over a confrontation that had taken place within the prison. My son had been threatened by Emil and told to withdraw the complaint against him at Human Rights Commission. But, he did not want the complaint to be withdrawn. This is merely a personal revenge, remarked Merlin. 
Wijayas mother testified in a murder case against Rangajeewa
-Wijayas father
Wijaya Rohana aka Gundu Mama was just over 40 years old when he was killed whilst being in Weilkada Prison. In 1997 he was a Department of Information accredited photojournalist at the Janahanda Organization. Samsan Alwis, Wijayas father, spoke to the Daily Mirror, displaying his sons last remaining memento, Wijayas media identity card. 
Alwis unfolded a devastating story about how his won was deliberately taken into custody. According to him, Wijaya was arrested over false charges in an attempt to influence Wijayas mother M. Siriyawathi, who had witnessed a crime allegedly committed by IP Rangajeewa. 
We live on Magazine Road, Welikada. If my memory serves me right, it was before 2014, when my wife M. Sriyawathi had witnessed IP Rangajeewa beating and killing a user of drugs named Channa near our house. My wife was the only eyewitness to the incident and this put our family in hot water. My son had also published some photos of Rangajeewa in the newspaper and he was angry as a result. So, he had two reasons to take revenge on my son. They deliberately filed a charge against my son that had a connection with heroin. That is what they usually do if they want someone arrested, he said. 
Siriyawathi, being informed of the riot through news broadcasts, had called the Prison at midnight on November 9. She had managed to speak to her son who told his mother that he was safe by that time. But, he was later dragged out of the cell and shot at. 
IP Rangajeewa had visited Wijayas house during the memorial service a week after Wijayas death. Alwis claimed that Rangajeewa, accompanied by four others  probably policemen  were under the influence of alcohol at the time of the visit. Alwis said that his wife had been threatened. Alwis further said that alcohol must have given Rangajeewa a clumsy frame of mind because he had recounted Wijayas death, in Welikada. 
Your son was a cheap and worthless chap. So, I dispatched him to the hell where he deserved, Rangajeewa had told Siriyawathi and Alwis on that day. 
Meanwhile, the case relating to the alleged murder of Channa, where Siriyawathi was an eyewitness, is still proceeding in High Court. 
However, the story did not end there. Siriyawathi was suffering from cancer. A depressed Siriyawathi took no notice of her disease until it grew throughout her body. In 2014, Siriyawathi, who had experienced severe body pains, was rushed to the hospital, accompanied by her daughter-in-law Samanthi. But, they could not reach the hospital. 
While they were heading to the hospital, they bumped into IP Duminda Balasoriya of Walana Anti-Corruption Unit on the Magazine Road. He stopped them and and began questioning them. 
I am the mother of Wijaya Rohana, who was killed in cold blood, by Rangajeewa. Leave us alone at least now, an irritated Siriyawathi, who was annoyed by the IPs behaviour, had told him, according to Alwis. 
IP Balasoriya had then dialed Rangajeewas number. Alwis said that although Samanthi could not hear what Rangajeewa had told during the telephone conversation, she had heard Balasoriya replying What to do I have to agree with you to do it although it is a sin. Those words had brought the phone conversation to an end. Siriyawathi, along with Samanthi, was brought to the police station. 
The police allegedly put 550 mg of heroin for each individual as the charge against us. We were remanded on that day itself. We asked IP Balasoriya why he had no mercy for us and whether he had parents. He said his parents had died when he was a child, Samanthi recalled.
Alwis made every attempt to request bail for his wife. However, in early January, 2016, she was rushed to the hospital. After a one and a half month battle with cancer Siriyawathi passed away in February.
Alwis sought legal action against the injustice from The Human Rights Commission in Sri Lanka. Proceedings of the case HRC/2926/14 which lasted for two years, ended with no further action being taken. When inquired into by the HRCSL, it said their recommendations had already been sent to the relevant authorities and now it is not their job to follow the recommendations given. 
The Human Rights Commission attempts to cover up cases where the police and law agencies authorities are found to be the guilty party, alleged Alwis. 
Complaint at HRCSL against Rangajeewa had to be withdrawn due to threats
- Nirmala Atapattus father
Nirmala Atapattu was another prisoner who was selected and gunned down. Nirmalas devastated father, Siripala Atapattu, wrote a letter to the Prime Minister last year narrating the ordeal his son had to experience. Earlier, Nirmalas family had also lodged a complaint with the Piliyandala Police Station and The Human Rights Commission, Sri Lanka against IP Rangajeewa. However, Nirmala had been repeatedly threatened by Rangajeewa, forcing him to withdraw the complaint at HRCSL. As a result of the demand, Nirmalas father had decided to withdraw the complaint considering the safety of his sons life. 
Nirmala, a father of one, was a barber and a driver by profession. On June 24, 2009, Nirmala had finished his work early and returned home as he had developed an illness. Several policemen led by IP Rangajeewa and attired in civvies had entered Nirmalas house in Madapatha around 11 pm on June 25, 2009. He was asleep at that time. When inquired into, the policemen had said that they had come to arrest him for the use and sale of narcotics. Nirmala firmly had denied these allegations. Siripala said that his son had been brutally assaulted inside his house. 
Claiming that they had received a tip-off stating that my son was involved in drug business, they raided our house. But, they did not find any illegal stuff. They even threw chili powder in my sons face. They beat my son so badly that he vomited. Then, he was stripped. Following this ordeal which lasted for two hours, they took my son to the police station, Siripala said. 
The rest of Nirmalas story is much like what happened to Wijaya Rohana. Nirmala had phoned his wife and his father around 11 pm on November 9 to inform that he was safe. But, he was also in the list. 
We made every possible attempt to save him when he was in remand. When the real culprits of the drug menace are roaming free, my innocent son had to die because of wrong information, the police had received. No matter how much we are compensated with, we lost our beloved son, our daughter-in-law lost her husband and the little kid lost his father, Siripala narrated. 
They want me arrested to finish me off inside prison
- IP Rangajeewa
IP Rangajeewa filed a Fundamental Rights Petition in Supreme Court on March 20 this year, seeking an Interim Order directing the respondents including DIG Ravi Seneviratne of CID, IGP Pujith Jayasundara and the Attorney General not to arrest him until the final determination of the FR application is made. The court was also requested by IP Rangajeewa to declare that there was an imminent infringement of the fundamental rights of him guaranteed under Article 12 (1), 13 (1) and 13 (2) of the Constitution by the aforesaid respondents. In his petition, he has responded to the allegations levelled against him for his involvement in the shooting of inmates. 
The search was jointly conducted by STF and Intelligence and Protection Unit of the Prison Headquarters for drugs and other illegal stuff on November 9, 2012. When they tried to search the Chapel Section in the prison, the prisoners have openly resisted, attacking the STF officers with stones. Within a few hours, this resistance had developed into a full scale prison riot. Later, the Army had to be called to rest control of the situation within the prison which was created by rioting prisoners. By the following morning, the Army had managed to quell the riot and bring the prison under control. This riot had resulted in the death of 27 prisoners. 
The drug traffickers and their agents were making another attempt to get rid of me by getting me falsely implicated in the case of Welikada Prison Riot that had taken place on November 9, 2012. They alleged that I was involved in the killing of some of the prisoners in Welikada Prison on that day and wanted to get me arrested and remanded so that they would have an easy opportunity to finish me off within the prison.
When I visited the CID in November 2017, the officers attached to the Special Unit 1 of the CID informed me that several prisoners and a retired chief jailer who was on duty at Welikada Prison on the day of that incident had given statement in 2017 alleging that I was one of the persons who entered Welikada Prison in civilian dress in the early hours of the day, in question, and was instrument in identifying and picking up 8 prisoners who were later found to have been shot dead. I categorically denied the allegation made against me, stating that I had no involvement whatsoever in the events that took place within Welikada Prison in November 9 and 10, 2012.
Despite there being a serious threat to my life and my health likely to be jeopardized if I am arrested and remanded, proceedings are being instituted against me in the Magistrates Court, Colombo. Since this is being done on the basis of this new politically motivated investigation conducted at the insistence of NGO activists pursuing political agendas and having links with drug dealers, I made representations to the Attorney Generals Department through my Attorney-at-Law It is respectfully stated that any institution of proceedings against the petitioner on the basis of this politically motivated investigation, on complaints made with the blessing of large scale drug traffickers, would inevitably result in seriously affecting the credibility of the petitioner as a witness in over 50 narcotic cases pending in the High Courts, culminating in the discharge of all those drug traffickers.
I respectfully state that the said respondents have acted maliciously, capriciously, arbitrarily, unfairly unreasonably and unjustly, motivated by political and / or other extraneous considerations when they field the further report produced and marked P13 in the Magistrates Court of Colombo and moved for impounding my Passport. 
Those who died might have been on the wrong side of the track, when the prison riots occurred. But, they too had a right to life. Punishment for those who are responsible has been slow in coming. The family members, whose loved ones died while serving their terms in prison, are waiting till the alleged mastermind of the shooting is brought to book.
