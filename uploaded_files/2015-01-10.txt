Video: UPFA supports Common Opposition?s 100-day programme
	
Badulla District Parliamentarian Nimal Siripala de Silva said today UPFA would not hinder the common opposition?s 100-day programme and assured its support in carrying out it.
?We will not obstruct the common opposition?s 100-day programme. We hope they will carry out it as promised. People voted for Maithripala Sirisena because they approved their programme. We also expect to help him in carrying out it in matters that we can approve of,? he said.
Mr. de Silva said they would accept the new Prime Minister even though there were some constitutional issues in appointing him. ?We are not going to raise any technical issues,? he added.
Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa said they would not allow the former president Mahinda Rajapaksa to stay at home and said they wanted him to engage in active politics.
?He is still the SLFP president and would continue to engage in active politics. If anyone is trying to remove him, we will not let that happen,? he said.(Santh Desmond)

Modi invites President Maithripala Sirisena
	
While Prime Minister Narendra Modi was prompt in inviting Sri Lankan President-elect Maithripala Sirisena to New Delhi even before he was sworn in, the Congress-led Opposition appeared a bit circumspect.
Quite glowing in his praise, Modi, in his letter to President Sirisena, significantly wrote that it was the latter?s ?vision for Sri Lanka? and his ?capacity to connect with people?s yearning for change? that ensured his victory.
Also underlining his approach towards the Saarc neighbourhood since he was sworn in, the Prime Minister added that he hoped to ?take? Indo-Sri Lankan ?relations to a new level for the benefit of the people? of the region.
Having set a positive tone, the PM then softly advised the newly elected President that ?effective reconciliation? was crucial, for him to succeed in building a ?peaceful and prosperous Sri Lanka?. Modi?s invite to the new Lankan President came thereafter.
Though no less welcoming of Sirisena?s victory, the Congress underlined that the election should usher in a new era for the long suffering ethnic Tamil population of the island nation.
This was after party supremo Sonia Gandhi?s congratulatory statement to the new Lankan President was read out. ?We hope that the new President would use the mandate and the votes he got from the (Lankan) Tamil population to make tangible progress on long-pending issues. We hope he will uphold the rights of the minority population of his country,? Congress spokesperson Shoba Oza said. (The New Indian Express)

<U+200B>Video: We added 9 lakhs; Champika
	
	The JHU General Secretary Patali Champika Ranawaka addressing a media briefing said that the JHU managed to muster 9 lakhs of new votes to President Maithripala Sirisena from the Sinhala Buddhist areas at the January 8th polls.
The ex-minister made this remark comparing the outcome of presidential poll with that of 2010 in which the JHU backed Mahinda Rajapaksa.
He added that despite a massive campaign by the ex-President?s team to ?mislead the Sinhala voters? the educated Sinhala voters had come in their hundreds of thousands to back Maithripala.
?Our presence in the alliance for common candidate made the Sinhala voter confident that their aspirations and rights would always be protected under the Presidency of Maithripala Sirisena? he observed.
Minister also thanked the IGP and the Elections Commissioner for thwarting what he termed a mass attempt to rig the election by using the military.WATCHPix by Pradeep Dilrukshana
