A cataract catastrophe
	

Cataracts have become a common issue that deteriorates the quality of vision. This is especially common in the elderly as the cataract formation probability increases with age. Dr. M. Wijetunge, retired Consultant Eye Surgeon of the Ragama Teaching Hospital, clarified on what cataracts are and answered many questions that are raised at forums with regard to this condition in the eyes.

Definition
The eye consists of many parts. The cornea, pupil, iris, lens, retina, are some of the most talked about parts of the eye. Light rays focus on the retina. The lens and the cornea refract light rays fallen on the retina. The refractive power of the cornea is higher than that of the eye lens. The eye lens is a transparent component that allows light rays to pass through. It consists of a capsule and an inner portion. The lens comprises proteins. When these proteins thicken, the lens develops a white opaqueness which prevents light rays from passing through, ultimately creating difficulties in vision. This is known as a cataract, explained Dr. Wijetunge.


Causes 
Most of these conditions relating to cataracts develop due to age. There are other risk factors too that contribute to the formation of cataracts. Some diseases such as diabetes, some endocrinological problems that result in a decrease in calcium levels in the blood can also contribute to the formation of cataracts. Trauma to the eye, use of certain eye drops, medicinal drugs used for cholesterol management, exposure to UV radiation through sunlight and exposure to other radiation sources, infections, physical and chemical are some other causes. The majority of cataracts form with age, Dr. Wijetunge said. There are some cases of cataracts that are inherited and appear at birth. They are known as congenital cataracts. 

Symptoms 
According to Dr. Wijetunge, cataracts show symptoms of a gradual decrease in vision. Vision becomes blurred with time due to the progression of the cataract. There are instances where vision may be weak in the mornings, but improves during the evenings. With age, especially after the age of 40 years, people tend to develop presbyopia. When people suffer from presbyopia, they become long sighted and cant see things that exist within a short distance. But the opposite happens when a person suffers from a cataract. They become short sighted and are unable to see things that exist within long distances. Glares from vehicle headlights and other bright light sources cause discomfort to the eye, Dr. Wijetunge accentuated. 

Diagnosis 
If the cataract is severe and has developed over a period of time, it can be identified with the use of a torch, said Dr. Wijetunge. The pupil of the eye is dilated and the eye is examined for any cataract developments which will be visible as some sort of a white formation in the eye. Dr. Wijetunge mentioned that there are other methods such as the use of instruments to examine the eye regarding cataracts. A retinoscope and an ophthalmoscope are some such instruments that can be used in the aid of cataract detection. 

Treatment 
The only option regarding cataract treatment is surgery. The impaired lens with the cataract formation is replaced with an artificial lens during this surgery. This operation which is performed to remove the cataract is known as phacoemulsification. The eye lens is composed of a capsule and an inner portion. The cataract forms in the inner portion due to the thickening of proteins. Through cataract surgery, the inner part of the lens is removed and substituted, Dr. Wijetunge explained. He further explained the procedures of the surgery. A 2.2mm cut is made in the cornea. Aspiration of the lens is followed by the injection of a foldable lens into the eye through the cut made in the cornea, he explicated. The surgery is only a one-day operation which lasts for about 5-10 minutes. The patient isnt made unconscious and a gel is applied to the eye as anaesthesia. The eye will be kept covered for one day. Usually the patients vision will be restored to normalcy after one day. The patient is prescribed eye drops as post-surgery medication. The surgery does not hinder the patients ability to continue with day-to-day activities. A person can take a shower 4 days after surgery, he informed. Congenital cataracts can also be treated through surgery. But there is a minor complication. Some people inherit cataracts by birth. This is a congenital condition. This too can be treated by surgery. The only problem is that infants cant undergo surgery right away. They have to wait until they reach a minimum age of 2 years to undergo phacoemulsification. The reason is that they are still developing. Their eye lenses are hard to measure in order to replace the impaired lens with an artificial one as the eye lenses are still growing, Dr. Wijetunge explained. 

Prevention 
Avoiding steroid eye drops and use of sunglasses to prevent exposure to UV from sun light are a few ways in which the risk of cataract formation can be minimized. Preventing traumatic incidents to the eye is equally important.

A guide to a quick assessment of a horoscope
	
DM Astro part- 13

There has to be a methodology underpinning the process of learning any subject. However, it is a great advantage to have a good grasp of the broad principles or fundamentals relating to a particular subject before undertaking an in-depth study of the various parts of the subject step by step. This rule holds good for the study of Predictive Astrology as well.

Broad principles as a guide
There are certain broad principles serving as a guide to judging a horoscope at a glance. It is very helpful for a student of Astrology to have a thorough understanding of such principles for studying the rationale behind these principles in detail. Let us look into a few broad principles that can guide you to make a quick judgment of a horoscope.


When Lagnadhipati is in the Lagna itself
Even a person born into a poor ordinary family would rise to a very high position if his Lagnadhipati is posited in the Lagna, a quadrant (Kendra) or a trine (Moolatrikona) or in the 11th House aspected only by benefic planets.

When Jupiter, Venus and Mercury posited in a quadrant or a trine
If Jupiter, Venus and Mercury are posited in quadrant or a trine, the native is assured of learning, wealth and fame. The native would achieve wealth, prosperity, and a position of authority when several planets are exalted, Swakshetra, or Vargottama ingood Bhavas.

Benefits in dwirdwadasa position to Sun
Benefits in the 2nd and the 12th Houses from the Sun confer strength on the native to achieve self-reliance and prosperity through perseverance. Benefics on either side of the Moon, in the same sign or the Houses adjoining the sign give the native a sound and agile mind, peace, happiness and prosperity.
The native is very fortunate if the 9th House is occupied by its lord or by benefics and aspected by benefics.

Conjunction of benefics, mutual aspects and exchange of signs
Conjunction of lords of trines and quadrants, their mutual aspect or exchange of signs confer success and prosperity on the native. Benefics in the quadrants and malefics in the 6th, 8th and the 12th Houses give success and happiness.

Vacant 6th, 8th and 12th Houses
If there are no planets in the 6th, 8th and the 12th life becomes free from misfortunes. Malefics in the Lagna, the 2nd and the 9th Houses make the native lead a life of grinding poverty and hardship.

What the Lagna represents
The Lagna represents the personality, traits, childhood, health, environment, physical body, and the general character. If the Lagnadhipati is strongly posited and if the Lagna is aspected by only benefics, the native would have a successful beginning in life.
If the Lord of the Lagna occupies a trine or a quadrant Swakshetra or exalted, the lord of the 8th in a House other than an angle and the Lagna is occupied by a benefic, the native is blessed with good health and long life. Aries, Leo and Sagittarius natives are energetic and vigorous from birth due to the influence of the Sun and Mars. In their 20s and the 30s they show a tremendous drive, an imposing personality, and marked organizational and administrative skills. Most captains of industry and commerce today are those who have been born under these signs.

Positions that produce multi-millionaires, great thinkers and upright rulers
A person born with Rahu, Mars, and Saturn posited in Virgo would be a multi-millionaire.
People born in Cancer are great thinkers. They are short-tempered, they have a forget and forgive nature. 
Taurus natives are strong-willed and persevering. Many firm and upright rulers have been born underthis sign.

AG says very revealing communications of Aloysius to be presented
	
While reserving a date to place details with regard to communications of Arjun Aloysius and other concerned parties, Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda yesterday told that the content of the extracted Whatsapp messages of Aloysius phone was very revealing.
Using Aloysius mobile phone data extracted at the forensic retrieval and the details received from his mobile service provider, ASG Kodagoda will lead evidence through an analyzer with regard to the communications took place between Arjun Aloysius and concerned parties.
At the onset of the yesterdays proceedings, ASG Kodagoda led four witnesses, who were attached to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) on Bond Sale Issue as assisting investigators.
These investigators, Chief Inspector of Police Sampath Kumara Senaratne, Inspector of Police Ruwan Raban, Inspector of Police Nalinda Herath, Police Sergeants, Siril Ranasinghe and Mahindasoma Jayatilleke were from the Criminal Investigations Department.
Chief Inspector of Police Sampath Kumara Senaratne testified before the Commission with regard to the forensic extraction process conducted to retrieve data from the Arjun Aloysius mobile phone as he was the licensed official who extracted data from Aloysius mobile phone.
According to Mr. Senaratne, the extraction of data had been taken place on three occasions, on July 24 (8170 pages), August 24 (11,794 pages) and October 6 (9761 pages), in 2017 from Aloysius phone and converted to a PDF file format for the perusal.
ASG Yasantha Kodagoda said that in addition to the extraction of data of the mobile phone there was a process of re-construction of data in the forensic examination as many of data was deleted by the mobile owner.
The witness said that he had to examine the mobile phone thrice because Arjun Aloysius had not provided the passwords of his i-cloud account to access i-cloud data.
While Mr. Senaratna was concluding his evidence on forensic ASG Yasantha Kodagoda pointed out that it was the first time in Sri Lankan legal history that a forensic expert has been testified in relation to a data retrieval of a mobile phone, therefore a historical moment.
ASG Yasantha Kodagoda also yesterday sought the Commissions indulgence to lead another witness, an analyzer of data, Sub-Inspector Yasanka Jayasinghe in connection with the various communications that had been taken place between Arjun Aloysius and other concerned parties.
ASG Kodagoda said that they have received details from the mobile service provider of Aloysius phone (Dialog) and therefore will lead evidence through the analyzer combining the both data extracted from Aloysius phone and the service provider.
When questioned by Justice Prasanna Jayawardena on the clarity of the content of those details, ASG Kodagoda saidThere are several Whatsapp messages, of which the content was very revealing.
Testifying before the Commission, CID officials, Ruwan Raban (IP), Nalinda Herath (IP), Siril Ranasinghe (PS) and Mahindasoma Jayatilleke (PS) were of the view that they had treated the witnesses well while recording the statements.
According to the CID officials, it was revealed that every witness who had recorded statements with the CID had been given a equal opportunity to consult his or her lawyer during the process of the interview.
When these CID officials were cross-examined by counsel appeared on behalf of Arjun Aloysius and Perpetual Treasuries Ltd, the officials were of the view that they did not at any point pressure or induce any individual while recording statements during the initial investigation into the Bond inquiry.
Considering health condition of Justice Prasanna Jayawardena, the Commission allowed the Attorney Generals Department official to call the last witness (data analyzer) on November 16, 2017. (By Shehan Chamika Silva)

Bond Commission denounces conduct of ASG De Livera
	
Bond Commission Chairman Justice K.T Chithrasiri and Commissioner Prasanna Jayawardena yesterday said the conduct of Additional Solicitor General Dappula De Livera was " deplorable".
"I have served 37 years as a judge and I have never seen this happen after an order is made" Justice Chithrasiri told the Commission.
A heated argument erupted after the Commission made an order which prevented the marking of statements given to the Criminal Investigations Officers during their inquiry, during evidence given by the officers yesterday.
The practice during the proceedings is to mark documents during evidence of a witness. The Attorney Generals Department sought to mark statements given to the Police officers by persons who were questioned by the Police officers during the conduct of the investigation by the Police.
Admonishing ASG De Livera who continued to make statements following the order given by the Commission, Justice Jayawardena said that he had never witnessed such behaviour in his entire legal career.
"Your behaviour is not fitting to a senior counsel. I warned you about your behaviour at the chambers as well and I have never seen such behaviour in my 30 years of conduct as your behaviour is deplorable" Justice Prasanna Jayawardena said.
During the day CID officials, Ruwan Raban (IP), Nalinda Herath (IP), Siril Ranasinghe (PS) and Mahindasoma Jayatilleke (PS) had testified before the Commission yesterday with regard to the way in which they had recorded statements of the witnesses.
The witnesses testified that they had interviewed and recorded statements from the witnesses, who were called by the Secretary of the Commission or the Attorney General.
While leading the first witness, Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda moved to mark a bundle of document which contained the copies of statements that were recorded by the CID officials from witnesses.
At this moment, Counsel Chanaka De Silva who was appearing on behalf of former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran strenuously objected to the marking of the statements recorded by the CID as evidence before the Commission.
He was of the view that the Commission opted to call witnesses to give evidence, and therefore the Commission acted upon the evidence given by the witnesses before the Commission.
Astatement made in front of a police officer is not evidence no where in our legal system that a statement made to a police officer is considered an item of evidence, he said.
Mr. De Silva also objected to the process in which these statements were brought in before the Commission to place as evidence.
He said that the most of the statements were available when the witnesses came and gave evidence before the Commission and none of these statements were either shown to them or put to them or even use for the purpose of contradicting evidence.
Mr. De Silva contested on the evidential value of the statements which were attempted to mark as evidence before the Commission. He also said that the way in which the marking police statements to the Commissions proceedings is alient to the current legal system.
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda replying to the objection stated there are two mechanisms to the Commissions process. First is the investigation process and the second is the Inquiry, we are currently going through the inquiry, where the witnesses being called and examined by the Counsel before the Commission. And the investigation process took place at the Commissions premises affected by the CID officers is the process of investigation.
ASG Kodagoda said according to the 2008 amendment to the Commission of Inquiry Act, there are specific reference with regard to the Investigation and Inquiry separately. Therefore,he said that the Commission, in arriving at the truth, can take cognizance of both evidence led during the Inquiry proceedings as well as the material collected during cause of the investigation.
ASG Kodagoda also stating the Section 7 (a) pointed out that this evidence will not be admissible in the civil or criminal future proceedings.
Then Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula De Livera also reading the provisoof section 23 of the Commission of Inquiry Act said that the Commission is mandated and required in law to examine the material and then come to a conclusion based on natural justice.
ASG Dappula De Livera said that the Commission has to have the regard to the material collected during the investigation and there is no other way.
Counsel Chanaka De Silva then reading the proviso of section 23 stated that one cannot use such material unless rules of natural justice are observed according to the law. He said that it was a prohibition on the Commission as per law.
Presidents Counsel Kalinga Indatissa who was appearing on behalf of Perpetual Treasuries Ltd and Presidents Counsel Anuja Premaratne also contested against marking the police statements as evidence before the Commission questioning that whether it was the proper mechanism to lead evidence and what the law is expected to protect as fairness and natural justice.
Considering all the submissions made by the Counsel, the Commission then delivered an order on the marking of statements of witnesses which were recorded with the CID officials at the initial investigation process.
The Commission was of the view that it was against the rule of natural Justice to admit these statements of the witnesses given to the police. And therefore, the marking of those statements as evidence was not permitted.
At this moment when ASG De Livera sought further clarifications about the order, Justice Prasanna Jayawardena replied that the Commission does not want to compromise the integrity of its report by any means therefore reached to that conclusion considering the proviso of section 23 of the Act.
We cannot observe at any material without concerning the natural justice, so far we have made every endeavor to act fairly, Justice Jayawardena said.
ASG De Livera continued to harp on the admissibility of the statements pointing out a previous occasion in which a contradicting order was given, according to De Liveras " recollection".
However, the Commission said that no order of that nature had been made. Thereafter Justice Jayawardena urged that the matter be left there and to continue with the proceedings.
Now we have made an order so lets move on, Justice Prasanna Jayawardena said.
At this moment Presidents Counsel Anuja Premaratne cross-examined the first witness and soon after he finished his questioning, ASG De Livera again addressed the Commission on the Commissions order given on admissibility of the statements.
ASG De Livera: Now this Commission prevented itself from looking at the investigating material
Justice K.T. Chitrasiri : Statements!
ASG De Livera: Yes that is what the material is all about
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena: Even if we had accepted those statements, they have zero evidential value
ASG De Livera: Im making a legal submission that the Commission has prevented itself from looking at material
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena: If that is your position,then please file written submission in that regard because I do not agree with you because I think your submission is ridiculous. In my view your submission has no any merit because the investigation is a process prior to the inquiry and now we have listened to witnesses at the inquiry level and we are now in evaluating the evidence, so we have no reason to go through these statements because we cannot rely what stated in the statements as it was done without any oath. If there was a contradiction of the statements and the testimonies given by the witnesses then it should have been put to the witness at that stage.
ASG De Livera: Im only saying that this Commission has prevented itself looking at the material which the Commission is mandated under the law to do and thereby now the Commission is making a mockery of these proceedings.
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena: Im sure your words will be appropriately reported in the media reports, which will give you satisfaction. We are not interested in what newspapers report, we are interested in our job which Im sure will upheld by any court. When an order is made, one can go and canvass against it at the appropriate court. Making statements standing in the bar table is not appropriate.
ASG De Livera: If the order is per incuriam we can do it.
At this moment there was a heated argument between the Commissioners (Justice Jayawardena and Justice Chitrasiri) and ASG Livera.
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena: I warned you about your behaviour earlier as well
Justice K.T. Chitrasiri: This is not the first time that you have behaved liked this after the Commission is made the order. Definitely we are going to think about this behaviour.
ASG De Livera: Im only saying that the order is per incuriam ( Without due regard to Law or Facts)
Justice Prasanna Jayawardena: Your behaviour is not fitting to a senior counsel. I warned you about your behaviour at the chambers as well and I have never seen such behaviourin my 30 rears of conduct as your behaviour is deplorable.
Justice K.T. Chitrasiri: I have served 37 years as a judge and I have never seen this happens after an order is made
ASG De Livera: I only made this submissions in the interest of the justice. (By Shehan Chamika Silva)

## Title: Cows milk protein allergy on the rise

Cows milk protein allergy on the rise
	

The cows milk protein is present in all formula milk products. When such products are introduced into the babys system, this could cause allergic reactions
	The ideal would be for the mother to exclusively breast feed the baby as long as possible and weaning other foods should begin after 6 months

Baby milk formula has been a true facilitator to working mothers, mothers who are unable to produce breast milk and adoptive parents. However, there has been a rise in the number of babies receiving allergies due to the frictional proteins found in cows milk. This entity is called cows milk protein allergy. To expand our knowledge on the subject the Daily Mirror spoke to Dr. Kosala Karunaratne, Consultant Pediatrician of the Lady Ridgeway Hospital. 
Background to the disease
Dr. Karunaratne gave the Daily Mirror a brief background on the subject. He said, Man is a mammal. Therefore all mammals feed their offspring with milk from birth. In contrast to other mammals, even primates, the human baby takes a long time to grow. The cow especially, takes only a few years to grow. Though all mammals produce milk they produce milk that will complement the growth of their offspring. Since the cows growth rate is very fast their calf need more proteins than humans.
Therefore, they have a higher concentration of protein and the constitution and structure of their proteins differ from humans. Cows milk carry a protein called beta lacto goblin, whereas humans carry a protein called Alfa lactam albumin. Thus if a human baby is exposed to cows milk the protein becomes a foreign entity to the baby. Therefore, the immune system of the babys recognizes the protein as antigenic, and mounts a response against it. The allergy can be brought on by giving cows milk products to the baby. Whether it is an expensive formula milk product or an unmodified cows milk the cows milk protein is difficult to modify structurally. Therefore the antigenicity remains constant.

In contrast to other mammals, even primates, the human baby takes a long time to grow. The cow especially, takes only a few years to grow. Though all mammals produce milk they produce milk that will complement the growth of their offspring. Since the cows growth rate is very fast their calf need more proteins than humans. Therefore, they have a higher concentration of protein and the constitution and structure of their proteins differ from humans

He further said, This response of the immune response can manifest many symptoms in the baby. These symptoms can be either subtle or dramatic. The subtle symptoms may not be even detected at first instance, such as growth and nutrition problems

Symptoms
Dr. Karunaratne said, The cows milk protein is present in all formula milk products. When such products are introduced whether it is from the birth or after the mother resumes working, the cows milk protein are introduced into the babys system and this could cause allergic reactions. Broadly speaking there are two main groups of the cows milk protein allergy. One group is where the symptoms can be perceived rapidly, such as skin allergies (hives, rashes etc.) or where the baby suddenly collapses after an anaphylactic reaction (an extreme, allergic reaction to an antigen to which the body has become hypersensitive). When there are dramatic reactions it is easier to halt the allergic reaction as it is easily identifiable and thus curable. The reaction that is borne immediately is called the IgE mediated allergic reactions. In lay terms it means the immune system of the body is acting directly to the foreign protein in the system of the baby.

Parents and a few doctors feel that lactose free milk powders are healthy option in contrast to the conventional cows milk formula. However, in such formulas the sugar lactose is excluded rather than the cows milk protein. Therefore the lactose free formula is not a solution to this predicament

Elaborating on the other group of symptoms which are rather subtle, he said, These are non-IgE mediated reactions to cows milk protein. This is the immune system acting indirectly and where the symptoms show after a delay. The symptoms can be perceived as follows: loose stools- where the it can be greenish or blood stained or frank blood clots and can be easily mistaken as a infective diarrhea, growth failure- where the child can have anemia through the blood loss of the stools, unexplained vomiting, allergic march- this begins with eczema on the face which concludes with asthma. It is rather difficult to diagnose the exact cause of such symptoms because the symptoms are on late on set. Such symptoms are thus misdiagnosed for other diseases.
There is also a rare form of cows milk allergy which is non-IgE which is called FPIES (food protein induced entero colitis). The mother cannot give this allergy through breast milk, but the baby can get severe immediate symptoms such as severe vomiting and collapsing. Though it is non-IgE mediated it is dramatic and severe. It can also be caused by the baby eating soya meat and eggs,he said.

Treatment
Dr. Karunaratne said, There are some situations where the mother has no choice but to give an alternative milk. Since cows milk proteins cause allergies there are solutions to this predicament. A doctor could recommend hypoallergenic formulas. In these formulas the size of the protein has been modified and reduced and thus the allergic reactions are less. However even these milk products can cause allergic reactions. Therefore, if the baby is still getting the symptoms, a pediatrician should be consulted to receive special milks. There are two types of special milks that would be prescribed: protein hydrolyzed milk powder: this is where the protein is completely modified and the size of the protein is reduced and amino acid based milk powder: where the protein size is even more reduced because the basic protein structure is amino acid (the smallest unit of protein). However amino acid based milk powder unfortunately is not readily available in Sri Lanka.

Dr. Karunaratne warned against the use of lactose free milk powders. He said, Parents and a few doctors feel that lactose free milk powders are healthy option in contrast to the conventional cows milk formula. However, in such formulas the sugar lactose is excluded rather than the cows milk protein. Therefore the lactose free formula is not a solution to
this predicament.
Further, he said, There are soy milk formulas as well, but they have similar proteins as the cows milk. Therefore, allergies could still prompted by soy milk. 
When cows milk allergy is suspected in the baby the mother should restrict cows milk intake herself especially if she is breast feeding as her milk could also contain the cows milk protein, and thus cross over to the baby,he said.

What should I do as a parent
The ideal would be for the mother to exclusively breast feed the baby as long as possible and weaning other foods should begin after 6 months.
If you think the baby has symptoms due to cows milk visit your local general practitioner immediately for a prescription for alternative type of milk powders.
If the parents have a history of atopy (eczema, asthma and rhinitis) the General Practitioner could recommend a hypoallergenic formula.
If the child is getting serious reactions a pediatrician should be consulted where a special milk can be recommended. Serious allergenic symptoms cannot be treated with a hypoallergenic formula.

Ethnic-based federal units disadvantageous for minorities: MR
	
Former President and Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa, who participated in the debate on the constitutional reforms proposals,said the creation of ethnic or religion based federal units with powers akin to sovereign states will place the minorities living in those federal units at a disadvantage.
He said, in India, the vast majority of Indian Tamils live in Tamil Nadu whereas in Sri Lanka however, the majority of the Tamil people are permanently resident outside the North and East.
Even though there is a significant concentration of Muslims in the East, the vast majority of the Muslims are permanently resident outside the East. The creation of ethnic or religion based federal units with powers akin to sovereign states, will place the minorities living in those federal units at a disadvantage.I request the government to give up this quest for a new constitution which serves only the interests of northern Tamil politicians and places virtually everyone else at a disadvantage and to concentrate instead on fulfilling the original constitutional pledges they gave the people at the 2015 presidential elections. For a start, the government should let the public know their collective decision on the abolition or otherwise of the executive presidency. The other important matter that needs the attention of this house is the reform of the elections system. The way the elections laws for the local government institutions and the provincial councils were changed was haphazard and arbitrary and this will pose a grave danger to the stability of the governing institutions of the country.
He said the Yahapalana manipulation is glaringly obvious in this whole process of constitution-making .
The views that our MPs expressed in the various sub-committees were dropped when the reports were published. Look at the manner in which the debate on this interim report has been conducted in the past three days. First a UNP minister speaks on behalf of the government. Then a TNA member speaks on behalf of the opposition. Once again an SLFP minister speaks on behalf of the government. Then a JVP member speaks on behalf of the opposition. All these parties are yahapalana stakeholders, they are all in the constitutional conspiracy together. The genuine opposition force which is the Joint Opposition gets only two or three opportunities to speak a day.In order to justify their quest for a new constitution, members of the government have been claiming that I too had pledged in my manifesto for the 2015 presidential election to bring in a new constitution. That is true, but the question here is that the present constitutional proposals seek to divide the country whereas what I had in mind was a constitution that would enhance the unity and togetherness of all the communities that live in this country, he said.
The former President also said that all MPs should be allowed to vote according to their conscience when the voting is taken up on the new constitution
Mr Rajapaksa who was speaking during the debate on the constitutional assembly said he is making this request especially from Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
We have told the joint opposition MPs to vote in favour of the new constitution if they think the proposed new constitution is a good one. Likewise allow the ruling party members to do the same" he said while highlighting that there are 52 MPs in the joint opposition.
Further he said SLFP members in the government who oppose the new constitution are welcome to join the joint opposition. Also he urged the government not to create unrest among ethnic and religious groups by pushing for a new constitution.
There is an unprecedented unrest among the religious and ethnic groups which we have never been before. The Mahanayakas and even the Cardinal has expressed concern about this constitution" the former President claimed.
Responding to repeated statements made by ruling party members that he also pledged to bring in a new constitution, Mr Rajapaksa said he did make that pledge.
I did promise a new constitution and I did it with genuine intention. I always acted with honesty and tried to bring in reconciliation right from the time the war ended. We started development while working on reconciliation. Issues we face today would have ended if the then opposition supported us in this endeavor" he said.
We are committed towards resolving the issues faced by the Tamils, therefore don't label us as extremists" he said.
However he said joint opposition cannot support proposals that weaken the centre. Mr Rajapaksa was of the opinion that no one including the current MPs will be willing to contest a general election in the future if the legislature is weakened.
He charged that there is a proposal to devolve all powers of the centre to provincial councils and to set a federal state by merging North and East.
At this moment he asked Deputy Minister M LA M Hisbullah whether Muslims would welcome a merger. Mr Hisbullah replied saying they would not welcome it. Joint opposition MPs responded to this with loud cheers. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardane)

Former Deputy Minister Shantha Premarathne, who was found guilty of accepting a bribe of Rs.50, 000 from a woman after promising to get her a government job, was sentenced to four years rigorous imprisonment and told to pay a fine of Rs.10,000 by Colombo High Court Judge Piyasena Ranasinghe yesterday.
Assistant Director of the Bribery Commission Ms. Ruwani Wickramasinghe told court that the general public had been programmed to believe that while clerical level or junior employees were the ones who usually get caught in the net of corruption and are harshly penalised as a result, the bid fish or the ministers etc. are set free and often do not have to face the consequences when caught taking bribes among other crimes. Taking this into account she requested the judge to make an example of this accused who held a responsible post as a people's representative and hand out a severe penalty to him which would send a message to others of the same ilk that no one, big or small was above the law. She also stated that the accused had misled an innocent village woman by not delivering on his promise to get her a job after accepting the bribe.
The High Court Judge took the request made by the AD of the Bribery Commission into account when passing judgment on the accused. (Manopriya Gunasekera and Ranjan Katugampola)

Ill is CHEEVARA [robe] MONTH- Carl Jung in search of Gautama Buddha
	
Carl Jung 
Charata Bhikkave, Charikan, Bahujana Hitaya, Bahujana Sukhaya  
Oh! Bhikkus, for the welfare and contentment of many, through sympathy and kindness to the folk, go forth, and spread Buddha Dhamma for the benefit of deities and human beings. 
Significance of Ill Poya 
The three Jatila brothers, Uruwela, Nadi and Gaya Kassapa, who lived in a hermitage on the banks of Neranja, entered the Buddhist Sasana by laying the foundation to construct the Thuparama Dagoba in Anuradhapura. Here lies the right canine tooth (The Dakunu Haku Datuwa) of the Enlightened One.
Il or the month of October is also known as the Cheevara Masaya. The offering of Katina Cheevaraya (a monks robe) is considered as a highly meritorious act. This ceremony takes place during the month of Il. The Il Poya Day marks the end of the rainy season and the end of the retreat period also known as Vas. Buddhist Monks perform Pasuvas-the termination of the retreat period on Poya Day. 
Defining Cheevaradhariyek
The recent comments directed at a famous Buddhist monk by Field Marshall Sarath Fonseka, calling him a Cheevaradhariyek, raised concerns among members of the Buddhist fraternity. A senior head priest said that the word Cheevaradhari was a term used in a harmless way to describe a bikkhu (priest) or a person attired in a cheevaraya (robe). Some politicians capitalise on racist elements that exist among the clergy to create myths. This is done to divert attention from thefts. Compassion, one of the basic tenants of Buddhism, is forgotten. We read reports of how Cheevaradharis paraded the streets arousing the ignorant to act against innocent refugee families causing harm and untold misery to women and kids. 
Could Jung have thought that intellectual carelessness was foreseeable in such a near-paradise On his arrival in Colombo, Jung gave an unscheduled talk on the subject of imagining to the Rotherfield Psychological Society
Carl Jung 
Carl Gustav Jung (1875 1961) was a Swiss psychoanalyst and psychiatrist. His work has been influential not only in psychiatry, but also in philosophy, anthropology, literature, and religious studies. He captured the attention of Viennese psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud. The two of them exchanged correspondence and worked together on a common platform for years. Jung was also a craftsman, artist and a writer. He created some well-known psychological concepts, including archetypal phenomena, synchronicity, collective unconscious, and extraversion and introversion. 
In end 1937, Jung left Zurich on a tour of India and Sri Lanka where he felt himself under the influence of a foreign culture. Hindu and Buddhist philosophy became an important part in his understanding of the role of imagery and life. He admitted that the Western field of psychology wasnt competent in understanding the insight of the self. 
Richard Boyle recounts the strange affair of Carl Jungs journey to Ceylon. He experienced a near death experience a few years later.
It was Jung who rediscovered the nature of myth and symbol and distracted psychology from the restrictions of Freuds teachings. He sailed to Ceylon, and here found the Buddhist paradise he had sought, says, McLynn in his book Carl Gustav Jung (1996), the first biography of the psychologist. 
He visited Sanchi, the most significant of his stay in India. Sanchi was special to Jung because for him Buddhism was the most attractive of all the religions. unsurprisingly Jung was drawn to Buddhism, states McLynn. He favored Buddhas mode of overcoming the world by reason to that of Christ by sacrifice. As McLynn believes, Jungs work is full of appreciation for Buddhism and The Buddha. 
In Calcutta University he became involved in a debate regarding the extinction of awareness with various Brahmins. He believed that it was impossible to gain the state of being Not-conscious [nibbana in this life] while alive and still be able to remember it, as Hindus maintained. Patiently he disagreed with the Brahmins that one could not get rid of sense of self even in the deepest samadhi, for the moments of continuation would have been non-existent. 
Jung had a last, and significant place to visit before departing for Europe, declares McLynn. He sailed to Ceylon, and there he found the Buddhist paradise he had sought. Sri Lanka right away struck Jung as being, no longer India.
Could Jung have thought that intellectual carelessness was foreseeable in such a near-paradise On his arrival in Colombo, Jung gave an unscheduled talk on the subject of imagining to the Rotherfield Psychological Society, which had been founded to instruct the public in matters of mental health and to encourage mental well-being. Jungs talk, delivered at Dr. Ratnavales residence in Colombo was the focus of an extensive report featured in the Daily News of February 2, 1938. Jung declared to the large congregation that, Dreams are not the product of conscious and intelligent thinking or conscious activity. They cant be directed, produced at will, or controlled. They are the expression of an autonomous functioning of our psyche. 
Jung swiftly left the heat of Colombo for the cooler climes of hills, where he was to observe and perfectly comprehend the pooja ritual at the Dalada Maligawa (Temple of the Tooth). 
Young people placed massive mounds of jasmines in front of the altars, at the same time singing a prayer or a mantra. I thought they were praying to Gautama Buddha, but the monk who was guiding me explained, No, Buddha is no more; He is in Nirvana. We cant pray to Him. They are singing. This life is temporary as the beauty of these flowers. May my deva the guardian angel share with me the merit of this offering. McLynn explains Jungs Dalada Maligawa experience as follows: Intoxicated by the drumming and the singing, Jung realised that it was Buddhism that had made Ceylon and the South come alive for him as Benares, Calcutta and Orissa never had. These temple ceremonies summed up the relationship between the Self as eternal and the Ego as bounded by space and time. 
In his Collected Volume Jung relates numerous incidents he witnessed in Sri Lanka that for him exemplified this living Buddhism. The first happened when he came across two carters who had met in a narrow track and could not go by. Jung said that in Switzerland this situation would always have ended up in a quarrel, however in Ceylon the two men just bowed courteously to each other and said Passing disturbances, no soul. On another instance Jung narrates how he saw two boys fighting. They had thrown punches, but the fists always stopped inches away from the faces. Jung spent most of his time in Sri Lanka in the hills, primarily at the Dalada Maligawa, a place which he felt emitted a special charm. He was fascinated in particular about its inspiring library, where he conversed with the bikkhus and studied the Buddhist canon. 
From Kandy he proceeded to Colombo, where he boarded a ship for Trivandrum. After a meeting with a disciple of Ramana, the guru, in Trivandrum, Jung returned to Colombo and embarked on the passage back to Europe. Aboard the ship Jung commenced work on a new alchemical synthesis, and became so engrossed that he didnt land in Bombay. He was convinced that religious desire was as deeply rooted in humans as sexual instinct and that no religion, apart from perhaps an ultra-sophisticated account of Buddhism, was capable of obscuring the other. 
The Indian and Sri Lankan experiences confirmed Jungs holistic hypothesis that in the end everything links up with everything else, which he felt was evidence for the continuation of a collective unconscious. He also thought that there was a credible parallel between mandalas and the circular symbols so frequently drawn by his patients. 
May all beings be happy

India court jails two men for life for raping niece
	

NEW DELHI AFP Nov2, 2017 -An Indian court Thursday sentenced two men to life in prison for raping their 10-year-old niece, in a case that hit headlines when her appeal for a late-term abortion was rejected, a lawyer said. 
The girl, who cannot be named, gave birth in August after the Supreme Court rejected her familys plea that she be allowed a late-term abortion on health grounds. 
India only allows abortions up to 20 weeks except in cases where the life of the mother is threatened by the pregnancy. 
But many child rape survivors do not realise they are pregnant until after the 20-week limit, a problem highlighted by a slew of high-profile cases in recent months. 
Both men have been sentenced to life imprisonment, public prosecutor Atul Sethi told AFP by telephone.

Katina Cheevaraya in search of a deserving monk
	
Sri Dalada Maligawa (Temple of the Tooth) was the much looked forward to venue when the Katina Cheevaraya (robe) was offered this year. This is an annual event where many formalities are observed.
The ceremony takes place at the Dhana Salawa (Alms Hall) of the Maligawa.One hundred and fifty monks participated at this ceremony headed by the Anunayake of Malwatta Ven. Panditha Niyangoda Vijithasiri Thera. The officiating Mauale Thera of the Inner Shrine Room Ven. Thibbotuwawe Meanakara Thera officiated the ceremony. 
The offering at Katina Cheewaraya after the Vas period (Rainy season) before IL Poya underscores the most democratic process that was enunciated by Gauthama Buddha. The Katina Cheevaraya is primarily meant to be offered to a monk who is in need of a robe and not necessarily to a monk who has been on a retreat at any particular temple. The recipient of the robe is decided by the congregation of monks who attend the ceremony. 
Hardships
During the time of Buddha, Jainism was at its peak where nearly 76 sects had been practising this religion. Those practising Jainism were engaged in a form of a retreat during the rainy season, in selected places. But the monks, who were in retreat, had the habit during the rainy season to visit places where people were serving those who were on retreat.As a result monks who were on the move were seen trampling insects and breaking tender plants while moving about. The Jains who practised Jainism didnt like this and as a result attracted criticism. This development had some effect on the Buddhist monks. 
The Diyawadana Nilame Pradeep Nilange Dela offering a pooja to the Anaunayake of Malwatta Venerable Panditha Vijithasri Thera.

Buddhists in villages and together with monks are trying to maintain traditions and honour the principles enunciated by Gautama Buddha. However there is a decline in the practice of this tradition in the urban areas of the country.

In villages situated in the Central Province monks depend purely on the contributions and alms offered by the villagers. These villagers make preparations for months before they offer the Katina Cheevaraya. 
It has been the Buddhist custom for people to invite Upasampada Theras (monks who have received higher ordination) to go on retreat to the Maligawa and also at various village temples. The invitation for the retreat is extended to monks three months before the rainy season begins. Upasampada priests look forward to this invitation because accepting such invitations brings huge merit for the laymen who serve these priests.
During one of the Vas seasons during the time of Gautama Buddha, thirty members of the Sangha, who were drenched, visited the Enlightened One. Gautama Buddha felt sorry for these monks. It was during this time that he decreed that monks should have an extra robe. This extra robe was known as the Katina Cheevaraya. It is the practice and the guided principle that a member of the sangha can posses only three robes; the underwear (Andanakade) and two other robes over it. Monks belonging to the older generation still wear the three robes as enunciated by Gautama Buddha. 
The white cloth is then dyed with saffron dye
So Buddha laid down the principle that during Vas Upasamapda monks should be in retreat for three months.
Buddha drawing a parallel with the teachings of previous Buddhas, addressed the monk order and specified the rules that should be followed by the clergy during the rainy season.
The activities at a temple are at their best during this three-month period. This is the time to conduct meditation programmes and have sermons. According to Buddha this is time presents an opportunity to gain the highest merit. This merit is observed both by priests and laymen.
It is a two way process whera the devotees who call upon the monks to observe Vas gain equally the merits as the priests who go on retreat. 
The white cloth to made into a Katina Cheevaraya  is brought into the  Dhane Salwaya of the Maligawa by a Benefactor Dhamitha Jayawardene
On a selected day all devotees gather at the Bana Maduwa (preaching Hall ) and the elders of the village call upon the monks to observe Vas. This invitation is extended to priests by offering Dahet (Betel leaves). With this invitation the monks and the elders reach an agreement with the devotees that the monks who observe Vas would not leave the temple without informing the devotees.
On the other hand the devotees agree to attend to the needs of the monks, including their medication. 
The monks on Poya day of October, who had observed Vas would enter their respective poya-ges (Place of retreat) and recite Patimokka. Each monk would invite fellow monks to point out any faults which may have been committed by him. 
The ceremonies related to the offering of the  Katina Cheevara are carried out as far as possible in keeping with the old rituals that have been followed since Buddhism was introduced to this country. 
The new robe
In the early hours of the morning before the Katina Cheevaraya is offered a white cloth is brought to the temple by devotees for the cutting and making of a robe. The robe is stitched at the temple in keeping with the tradition. This robe is then dyed and offered to the monks.
Buddhists in villages and together with monks are trying to maintain traditions and honour the principles enunciated by Gautama Buddha. However there is a decline in the practice of this tradition in the urban areas of the country
Following a discussion the most deserving monk is presented with this robe.The robe can be presented even to a monk who didnt go on retreat during these three months.
During this tradition certain conditions are laid down by the elder monks. These conditions must be observed by the monk who receives the robe. One of the conditions is that the robe should be in touching distance of the monk. It is specified that the monk should touch the robe everyday when he wakes up.
At the end of the ceremony an Anusasanawa (sermon) is delivered for the benefit of the devotees.

Petrol shortage across country
	
Long queues were reported outside filling stations in several areas both in Colombo and the outstations due to an apparent shortfall of stocks in filling stations run by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC).
CPC Trade Unions told the Daily Mirror that one shipment of 30,000 metric tonnes of petrol brought down by the Indian Oil Company (IOC) had been rejected due to an issue relating to its standard after some iron dust was found mixed with the petrol stock during its sample testing, probably resulting in the shortage.
The next petrol stock was scheduled to arrive in the country on November 8. Therefore, there is a possibility of fuel shortage in filling stations until then, a union official claimed.
The Fuel Dealers Association claimed some filling stations had been forced to close their petrol pumps as they had not received petrol stocks from the CPC since Thursday.
We had placed four orders for petrol in view of the long weekend, but we are yet to receive them, a spokesman for the association said.
Further he said Kolonnawa refinery had 7,000 metric tonnes of petrol and the Muthurajawela had 4,000 metric tonnes by October 31 and around 3,000 metric tonnes of petrol are used per day.
Meanwhile, it was reported that most of the CPC employees were on leave on Friday (Poya) for the long weekend which might have worsened the situation, he added.
However, the CPC had not made any statement over the prevailing petrol shortage. (Chaturanga Pradeep and Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Preventing poisoning accidents at home
	
Household poisoning is viewed as a global crisis. The elderly in modern Sri Lanka get hospitalized mostly by poisoning themselves. The young generation experiences poisoning due to individuals being unable to deal with lifes pressing issues. According to the records that reveal the number of hospitalizations due to poisoning, the highest number of such cases involve children who mistakenly poison themselves. This article emphasizes on the ways to minimize household poisoning. 
The common poisons largely contributing to household poisoning are categorized into three basic groups. 
1 Chemicals (Weed killers and other chemicals)
2 Medicine
3 Types of trees in the natural environment ( Trees, micro organisms and the fungi inhabited poisons.)
The weedkillers
Parents and caretakers can simply save their children from poisoning accidents by carefully storing and locking poisonous materials and keeping such products away from children. According to studies done regarding this matter, it was revealed that weedkillers are stored insecurely in nearly half of the houses where there are children below age 5. 

Tips for prevention
Carefully read the label on the weedkiller bottle. Usually the label includes descriptive information regarding usage, and what steps are to be taken to avoid poisoning accidents. Mixing, using and storing of weedkillers should be strictly done according to the instructions specified on the bottle. 
	Keep the lids of containers or bottles tightly closed while not in use. 
	Try to use the packeted products that are associated with a hard - to - open method. 
	Never change the original container used for storing those chemicals. If someone tends to use the chemical container-contamminated unknowingly, it is highly possible that the chemicals would mix with food or drinks. 
	Never store the weedkillers with food and always store them separately
	While using/ spraying weedkillers in or outside the house, keep children, pets and their toys away. Follow the instructions on the label and let children enter the area only after the effects of chemicals have subsided. 

Other chemicals
Kerosene, various types of batteries (remote controls, mobile phones and numerous other batteries of electric devices), household cleaners (tile cleaners, grout cleaners, toilet cleaners etc.) liquid soaps and detergents, fabric softeners, air freshners, body lotions, nail polish removing chemicals, and shampoos must be stored safely, out of the reach of children. 
Medicinal poison
Frequently used medicines that arent usually prescribed by the doctor such as simple pain killers, syrups for cough and influenza, antihistamines and vitamines must be stored safely. 
	Keep a reserved place to store medicines. 
	Do not keep tablets and syrups on the tables, in the kitchen or at easily- accessible places to children. 
	Keep an eye on the elderly, whether they are taking their medicines properly and whether they have the ability to recognize the differences between tablet. 
	It is much safer if the medicine-taking routines of elders is supervised. Medicine containers must be labelled with the name and intake time and the containers can be filled for a week for the convenience and safety of the elderly. 

Paracetamol complications are another common issue. Children are given paracetamol several times during a day. This drug must be administered according to the weight of the child, as prescribed in the label or according to the doctors prescription. Even though Paracetamol should be given once every six hours, if fever surfaces again before the end of the six-hour duration, another dose could be given after four hours after the first dose. Then the next dose should be given after eight hours. But these pain killers are not recommended for more than four dosages a day. 

Poisonous trees and seeds
Get to know the poisonous trees in your garden or area and keep them out of reach of children. Advise the children not to eat unfamiliar seeds, fruits and leaves. The Yellow oleander plant, best known as Kaneru is a harmful poisonous plant. This plant commonly grows in the gardens in most provinces. Every part of this tree contains highly poisonous substances. Therefore, it is safer not to grow this plant in the garden if there are children at home. 

Safety measurements
The most important step will be to follow the medical instructions immediately. Meanwhile read the product label and do accordingly. Do not try to vomit without the recommendation of a qualified doctor during a case of poisoning. Because some chemicals can destroy the mucous membrane of mouth and esophagus. And the vomiting can lead the food or the poison to enter the lungs. The chemicals entering the body this way can cause respiratory problems as well as infections. 

If a poisoned person vomits, clean his respiratory tract immediately. Cover your fingers with a piece of cloth before putting the hand into patients mouth or throat. If the person is unconscious turn him to his left and tilt his head a little up, keep the neck in a relaxed position and prevent the chemical from entering his lungs. Take him to a hospital ASAP. 
	If the patient is recognized to have convulsion, keep him lying on the floor to save him from accidents or falling 
	Relax or remove the tight clothing, especially around the neck. 
	nKeep him aligned a little to the left or right for this position can save his lungs from being contaminated with chemicals. 
	Be close to the person and be an attentive caretaker, until the patient recovers. 
	Remove clothes that have been stained by the poison. Wash the patients skin thoroughly with flowing water and soap. 
	If the environment is contaminated with any poisonous gas, keep the windows and doors open until the poisonous gases escape.
	If you have to enter a place contaminated with poisonous gases to save someone stuck there, breath deeply several times and keep the air inside before going in. Keep a wet cloth on your mouth and nose. Do not use lighters or match sticks, as some gases are highly inflammable. Check the heartbeat and the airway of the patient, soon afterwards. 
	Wash eyes using clear and lukewarm water following an accident caused by chemicals. The saline solution is ideal for washing. It is advisable to reach the doctor as soon as possible in case of an accident.

Recognizing Postpartum Depression
	

There is a huge stigma associated with the topics related to mental illnesses in Sri Lanka. One of these mental illnesses is Postpartum Depression. Patients dont recognize treatment for Postpartum Depression as important. This can negatively impact the health of both the mother and the baby.
Speaking to the Health Capsule Dr. Gayani Punchihewa, Senior Lecturer, Department of Psychiatry, Medical Faculty, University of Ruhuna, explained the causes, signs and symptoms, treatment and the screening tests that are available in Sri Lanka connected to Postpartum Depression. 

Definition
Explaining what Postpartum Depression is Dr. Punchihewa said, Postpartum Depression (PPD) or Postnatal Depression is a psychiatric illness that occurs after the delivery of a child. It is recognized as a unique entity in psychiatry because associated factors and the circumstances under which it occurs are different. After the pregnancy, the physiology of the womans body is different as there are hormonal and emotional changes.10 to 15% of mothers would develop PPD. But it usually goes undetected and therefore remains without being diagnosed. It is a principal condition which can be cured. The most important thing is that a mother needs to be both physically and mentally healthy for the newborns development. If the mother is depressed it will affect the mother -baby bonding, which is of utmost importance in the cognitive development of the baby,Dr. Punchihewa said.

Causes
Dr. Punchihewa stated that the genetic factor is one of the causes adding, It has genetic contributions. If the mother has a family history of psychiatric illness, there is a genetic predisposition, she said. 
Dr. Punchihewa further said,With the changes that occur in the mothers body following delivery, the hormonal, neurochemical and emotional changes make the mother more vulnerable to develop PPD. There are new responsibilities and she has to maintain family relationships. It is also physically exhausting especially if the mother has experienced difficulties during labour. So all these changes contribute to PPD. The risk factors regarding the development of PPD are past history of psychiatric illness, stress during pregnancy, domestic violence, poor family support, social issues etc.,she explained.

Signs and symptoms
Speaking of the signs and symptoms, Dr. Punchihewa said, It doesnt happen soon after delivery. Generally the signs and symptoms will appear three to four weeks after the delivery. The mother would feel tired, not interested in attending to the baby, her sleep will be disturbed, appetite will be low, she will be thoughtful, withdrawn, irritable and weepy. These are the normal symptoms of depression. But for a postpartum mother there are some other specific symptoms that will be exhibited which revolve around the baby and the family. In our community what we normally see is that they feel that they are inadequate as mothers. They have difficulties in breastfeeding. Most of the mothers visit pediatricians complaining that they dont have enough breast milk and that the baby is not putting on weight, the doctor said.
She further explained that when it gets worse the patient would start having hallucinations and delusions.
They can experience hallucinations and start hearing things when nobody is around; such as people talking to her. Common phrases they hear are: you are a bad mother or you are not playing the proper role of a mother. And then the delusions are that they develop abnormal beliefs concerning the baby or the other family members. This is not common and happens when the depression is severe and left untreated, she said. 
She further said, The highest risk is suicidal thoughts. It is so important to recognize this condition. when you see the news we hear of how mothers jump into rivers and take their lives, often along with the baby. These incidents are reported and the message given is that these incidents happen due to relationship issues with the husband and the in-laws, but the underlying cause (PPD) has been untreated,she explained.

Treatment
Speaking of the treatment thats administered, Dr. Punchihewa said that it depends on whether the depression is mild, moderate or severe.If it is mild, cognitive behavioural therapy, a form of psychological treatment, which would suffice. But if it is moderate or severe you need to specify medication so that pharmacological treatment is done and anti depressants are given. Medications that do not harm the baby are given, because the medication can enter the blood stream and go to the baby through breast milk. There are medicines which have minimum side effects on the baby, she explained. 
She further said,When you start treatment you wont get cured immediately. It takes time to be cured. Even after you feel better you are not supposed to stop the medication. You continue with it for about six months and then you gradually tail off the medication. It might take 6 to 9 months of treatment and you should follow the psychiatrists advice,she affirmed.
Dr. Punchihewa further said that there is another type of treatment for severe depression, especially regarding mothers who are having suicidal thoughts. The recommended treatment is electro convulsive therapy or what is called shock treatment. That acts faster, because medication takes time to act and patients who are having suicidal thoughts need to be treated aggressively. Many people have the wrong notions about electro convulsive therapy, but it is effective and a well tested method of treatment,Dr. Punchihewa said.

Difference between Postpartum Blues and Postpartum Depression
Dr. Punchihewa said, Postpartum blues is also known as maternity blues. It is a mild condition which resolves spontaneously. It lasts for about a week or two. The mother will be crying, will have a loss of appetite, find it difficult to cope and adjust to the new situation. But it will not last long. So the mother needs a lot of support from the family, the partner and the health care team. With support they can return to normalcy. It is a milder form of psychiatric condition and can be controlled with support and acceptance that she is getting adjusted to the new situation. It doesnt call for the use of medications. Around 30 to 80% of mothers can get maternity blues. But there is a risk of a mother who has developed maternity blues developing PPD later on,she said.

Men
Dr. Punchihewa further said that it is also recognized that men too can develop PPD, with the changes that occur in the responsibilities and the relationships. In other countries Governments authorize paternity leave after the baby is born and even in Sri Lanka now the fathers are entitled to paternity leave. But in our society leave for the father has not been recognized. Although this condition is present, we have not encountered fathers with PPD, she said. 

Screening test
Dr. Punchihewa stated that since the problem associated with PPD goes without being diagnosed and is unrecognized, they have now introduced a screening tool to the antenatal records in the primary health care system. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale has been included as a screening tool. This was introduced in our country around three or four years ago.
A questionnaire is given to the postpartum mothers in their third or fourth week by the midwife and they are supposed to fill it. There is a marking system involved. The total is 30 marks. If any mother gets 9 or more than 9 marks that mother needs to be referred to a psychiatrist. That doesnt mean that she has depression, but there is risk of developing depression. The condition of such mothers needs to be fully assessed by a psychiatrist. We need to raise awareness regarding the use of this screening tool as some mothers are reluctant to use it. They dont recognize it as something of importance and dont fill it. A difficulty we encounter is that when they are referred to the psychiatrist, they stay away due to the stigma associated with such mental conditions. It is important that they at least see a general practitioner to get themselves assessed, she concluded.

Small group of monks misbehave: CBK
	
Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga said at a recent function that a small group of extremist Buddhist monks, under the cover of their robes, were sowing discord, racism and religious fanaticism among the people.
She expressed these views at an event held at the BMICH on Wednesday to award prizes to the winners of the All-Island School Art and Essay Competition organised by the Office of National Unity & Reconciliation (ONUR) and the Bakeer Markar Centre for National Unity (BMCNU).
She said those who had no other means of gaining political power had resorted to racism and fanaticism as a tool for achieving their targets.
I am a good Buddhist. What is more regrettable is the fact that a group of Buddhist monks indulge in extremism. That is a minor group. A majority of monks are good. Yet, what is highlighted most is the extremist voice from a few. We should not stop doing what is needed in fear of these extremist few, she said.

Suu Kyi makes first visit to conflict-torn Rakhine
	

REUTERS, 02nd NOVEMBER, 2017
Myanmars leader Aung San Suu Kyi arrived on her first visit to conflict-battered northern Rakhine State on Thursday, an official said, in an unannounced trip to an area that has seen most of its Rohingya Muslim population forced out by an army campaign.
The State Counsellor (Suu Kyis official title) is now in Sittwe and will go to Maungdaw and Buthiduang too. It will be a day trip, government spokesman Zaw Htay told AFP, mentioning two of the epicentres of the violence but without elaborating on her schedule. It is her first trip in office to northern Rakhine, which has hosted the worst of the communal violence that has cut through the western state since 2012, severely damaging Myanmars global reputation.
It was not clear if Ms. Suu Kyi would visit some of the hundreds of Rohinyga villages torched by the army -- allegedly aided by ethnic Rakhine Buddhist locals -- or if she would be taken to see remaining clusters of the Muslim group, who are living in fear and hunger surrounded by hostile neighbours.

The history  of the  vanguard
	
The result of all these experiences with left-wing politics was a long tract against left-wing politics by the ex-communists
In colonial societies like ours, the rift in the left movement was between the base and the superstructure
It was this culture of political complacency that was echoed in the reactions of the left to the JVP student insurrection of 1971
The first of four articles delving into the Left movement in Sri Lanka.
Somewhere in the late forties and early fifties in the United States a group of intellectuals and artists who had earlier been members of the Communist Party publicly and willingly denounced communism. Some of them went further; they alleged that communists had infiltrated the Government and the movie industry and thus consciously started a witch-hunt against those who were felt to be too liberal, too soft, with respect to the Soviet Union. An irony, considering that the US War Propaganda Machine had covertly encouraged filmmakers (some of whom would side with the instigators of the witch-hunt) to depict the Soviets as a peace-loving people (this was during the Second World War incidentally, when the communists sided with the Free World against the Nazis). The result of all these experiences with left-wing politics was a long tract against left-wing politics by the ex-communists: The God That Failed. The title was interesting enough.
October Revolution
Isaac Deutscher, the Polish journalist, critic, and activist, whose biographies of Trotsky and Stalin are revered and acclaimed the world over even today, reviewed this book and began his review by quoting one of the writers, Ignazio Silone: The final struggle will be between the communists and the ex-communists. The names of the other writers were marketable enough: Arthur Koestler (Darkness at Noon), Andr Gide, Louis Fischer, Richard Wright, and Stephen Spender. There were other names involved, of course: Whittaker Chambers, who denounced Alger Hiss during the Red Scare years, and Max Eastman, who had been a close friend of John Reed, the American journalist who covered the October Revolution and was cremated after his death at the Kremlin.
Deutscher spared no words; for him, inasmuch as the disillusionment felt by these six ex-communists would have been powerful and understandable, the route they had taken, from disenchantment to anger to downright fury, merely made them embrace a form of totalitarianism and paranoia that was no different to that which they had rejected. As legal scholars have pointed out, after all, the Hollywood Blacklist, in which suspected communists in Hollywood were disbarred from engaging in any work in the industry, had no proper legal basis: it was and it remains illegal because no crime was ever properly defined, the powers of the American Congress notwithstanding. In embracing that kind of irrational frenzy, therefore, the ex-communist was no different to the fervent Stalinist. The heretic, Deutscher observed, becomes a renegade. Pertinent.
Its not difficult to imagine the ardent Stalinist cringing before the sight of intellectuals and thinkers being put to death

But there were reasons for the change, not least of them Stalins Purges. In themselves these constituted a flagrant betrayal of the revolution because the liberal tradition that had preceded it, during the Lenin years, were all gone in a series of kangaroo trials. Its not difficult to imagine the ardent Stalinist or even Trotskyite cringing before the sight of intellectuals and thinkers being put to death, or before the cowardice of those who had to yield and betray friends. An irony, certainly, because in later years they would be willing organisers of a similar series of kangaroo trials in their own country that promoted witch-hunts on the one hand and betrayals on the other. But Im digressing here.
The Left Movement in Sri Lanka
This November marks a hundred years since the October Revolution. What it means for Sri Lanka, whether the left movement in this country (if there is such a movement) has survived, are questions best answered later. For now, what interests me is this; in a context where the left has been consistently vilified using all sorts of epithets, what place did it have here and elsewhere historically In other words, has history been unkind
In colonial societies like ours, the rift in the left movement was between the base and the superstructure, or in other words the leadership and the membership. This translated to the rift between the vanguard and the laity, a rift that was necessitated in our societies because for the most it was the vanguard leadership who had access to Marxist literature. Obviously the membership, most of whom were barely conversant in English, did not have that access, a problem compounded by the fact that this was long before any proper Sinhala translation of those texts were made. What resulted was a curious contradiction, between the stated aims of a society of equals and the class orientation of the vanguard, most of whom, it must be said, came from the anglicised upper crust of their countries.
This November marks a hundred years since the October Revolution. What it means for Sri Lanka, whether the left movement in this country (if there is such a movement) has survived, are questions best answered later
Given this situation it wasnt too surprising that over the years the personal views of the leadership should clash and give way to rifts, splinters, and amalgamations within the parties based on ideological grounds; between the Stalinists and the Trotskyites, and later between the revolutionary and the gradualist wings of the Trotskyites. Sri Lanka unfortunately proved this to be more the case than the exception, unfortunate because, as the likes of Regie Siriwardena have observed, we did not have the kind of militantly nationalistic bourgeoisie who were agitating for independence in India. Consequently there was an opportunity for the Trotskyites, an opportunity that was not availed of. But this is not the only difference between colonial and postcolonial Sri Lanka (or between Ceylon and Sri Lanka) that proves vital to any assessment of our left movement.
Culture of political complacency
Commentators sometimes contend that what gave rise to the Stalinist excesses of the thirties and forties was the fact that the Communist Party, in Russia, was a vanguard entity, which is true to an extent. But the vanguard entity that spawned totalitarianism in that part of the world spawned apathy and complacency in ours: despite the best attempts by our most farsighted leftist leaders, N. M. Perera and Philip Gunawardena included, they could not resist yielding to ideological pressures brought about by populist politics. It was this culture of political complacency that was echoed in the reactions of the left to the JVP student insurrection of 1971. One by one, the revolutionists, who would all be rounded up and rehabilitated and then only released to their societies, were indicted as CIA-sponsored fascists fresh from their adventures in Jakarta (where the CIA had earlier taken part in the rise to power of General Suharto, who was by no means a leftist).
1956 had released a whole horde of idealists who would wallow in free education and a government they could consider as theirs. But not unlike the idealists of the forties in the United States, the children of 1956, or the children of those children, who had voted for change over the status quo and hence Bandaranaike over Senanayake, were fast becoming disillusioned by the leadership that had become the leaders of their movement, economically and socially. Needless to say it was during these years  the Sirimavo years, when Sri Lanka attained self-sufficiency in food and tried to keep up with the rest of the industrialised postcolonial world  which gave rise to two far-reaching issues: growing unemployment on the one hand and growing racial unrest on the other. The first would breed the insurrection; the second, a bloody, costly 30 year war.
By this time, of course, the rift between the vanguard and the laity, and the laity and the fringe, had given way: because of free education along with translations of Marxist texts and literature from Russia, an entire bilingual and vernacular generation grew up to spurn the Old Left that had inspired the vanguard movement. The Old Left was exactly that, therefore: Old. This wasnt the time for swimming pool, armchair socialists who smoked and led extravagant lives that were manifestly at odds with the kind of the lifestyles they were promoting throughout the country. They had earned the enmity of the bourgeoisie before; now they were earning the enmity of the people, predominantly the middle class.
So we all became renegades, but not before those among us who remained idealists took to the New Left. In the eighties the LSSP along with a bunch of other parties formed the United Socialist Alliance with Vijaya Kumaratunga to emulate the freewheeling, sahodhara-premaya rhetoric of the JVP. But it was to no avail: as I noted a few months back elsewhere, while the USA depended on Vijaya, Vijaya did not depend on the USA. When he was killed, consequently, the USA was finished, bringing about the third most significant political phenomenon since 1956 and 1971: the federalist-devolutionist discourse that continues in our political circles even today. But thats for another article.
If the sixties and the seventies saw a dismantling of the vanguard structure in our left movement, then the new millennium saw a dismantling of the rift between the lay membership and the fringe, at the expense of the leadership. What I mean here, of course, is the empowerment of the student movement, and the fringe movement, both of which have proved to be more powerful, more credible, than the politburos of the New Left. The fringe movement was formerly the monopoly of the ivory tower academic, whose main role today is to apologise for the excesses of whatever government he or she is a part of (a sad contradiction, certainly): now, on the other hand, it has been transformed to an oppositional space occupied by ordinary folk, artists, civil rights activists, intellectuals not cut off from the general public. This particular phenomenon deserves separate treatment. I will get to it. Here. Next week. For now, however, I am done.

The small sting thats a potential lifesaver
	

We are vaccinating them when they are young because as I mentioned, this is a prophylaxis vaccination. So, getting vaccinated after contracting the virus wont protect her from HPV or the risk of cancer

The community has been abuzz with the topic of a new vaccine added to the immunization programme this year. Known as the HPV vaccine, this little vial of fluid brings along many questions to the parents who are concerned about the need and the safety of the vaccine. This is why Health Capsule contacted Dr. Deepa Gamage, Consultant Epidemiologist at the Epidemiology Unit, to obtain more information on the newly introduced vaccine on our readers behalf. We hope this article would help clear existing doubts if any in the minds of readers, especially those who are parents and teenagers. 
The letters HPV stand for Human Papilloma Virus and this is identified as the main causative factor for Cervical cancer in women, according to Dr. Gamage. Cervix is the tube like structure attaching the uterus to the vagina, and cervical cancer is the second commonest female cancer worldwide, next to breast cancer. Research has found that annually, 850 to 1000 patients die of cervical cancer in Sri Lanka, Dr. Gamage revealed. 
The disease is usually identified in people who are aged around thirty years. The risk for this cancer increases with age. The majority of patients who have this cancer fall into the 45-50 year age group. Even though it isnt visible on the surface, cervical cancer is a great burden to Sri Lanka, stressed Dr. Gamage. 
These viruses, commonly transmitted sexually, dont produce acute symptoms like fever, as many other pathogenic viruses tend to do. It means that even though you have the virus within the body, you have no way of knowing, unless an investigation is carried out. Therefore these viruses remain on the epithelial surface of the cervix for years insidiously making cancerous changes in the cervix. 
What does the HPV Vaccination has to do with it HPV has many subtypes called genotypes. The genotype 16 and 18 is estimated to be the cause of 70% of all cervical cancers. Therefore by obtaining this vaccination, which protects against getting infected by the above two HPV genotypes, the risk of developing cervical cancer is greatly reduced in a woman. 

About the vaccine 
The vaccine is given as a prophylaxis against HPV, meaning that its aim is to prevent the disease from developing in the first place, not treating it. The vaccination is administered in two doses; the second dose taken at least six months after the first dose. 
But why is it being introduced to the country now Contrary to the opinion of many, this isnt a new vaccination to Sri Lanka. It was first introduced in 2010 to the private sector and has been used since. Due to its high cost, it wasnt available in the Government sector up until now. But we have incorporated it into the national immunization programme and it will be available every year from this year to girls in grade six, explained Dr. Gamage. WHO has also recommended this vaccine as part of the routine vaccinations that are administered in each country. 
What about the other girls and young women who have past age 12 by now The doctor said, The cost of vaccinating all women above 12 years of age isnt feasible due to the high price of medicine. We are planning on doing a review after two three years. If possible we will arrange a vaccination programme that covers other age groups as well, she replied. 

Side effects
We have already vaccinated 4000 girls under the programme and only a few cases were reported regarding those who had suffered side effects. The commonest complaints are the local reactions, like the mild pain and tenderness at the site. This isnt a cause for concern as the pain will subside in one or two days. Severe reactions to the vaccination are extremely rare, assured the doctor.


Who are the ones that dont qualify to receive the vaccine
The administration of the vaccination is delayed regarding patients who are suffering from acute illnesses like fever and respiratory tract infections, said the doctor. Also, caution should be exercised when vaccinating children who have known allergies to the contents in the vaccine or with individuals who have shown allergic reactions during the administration of the first dose, she added. The process of vaccination would be carried out in the presence of a qualified medical officer, who will consider all these aspects before administering the vaccination, she further stressed. 

Why should your child be vaccinated 
Some of the readers may pose the legitimate question, Why should I vaccinate my child to protect her from a disease that she may get in her adult life, or may not get at all Dr. Gamage had the answer. We are vaccinating them when they are young because as I mentioned, this is a prophylaxis vaccination. So, getting vaccinated after contracting the virus wont protect her from HPV or the risk of cancer,she explained. 
In addition to the vaccination, the ministry is conducting cervical screening programmes for adult women with the aim of recognizing the cancer in early stages, she said. 
Cervical cancer is a heavier burden than we realize, providing much pain and suffering. Its our ultimate happiness as parents to see our children live happy and long lives. By getting your child vaccinated, you can greatly reduce the threat of the shadow of cervical cancer affecting their lives one day, doctor Gamage concluded.

Using colours in harmony with the great scheme of rhythm
	

A great numerologist has said that the beauty of a piano carries no worth if its keys do not produce vibrations or notes in accord with the proper scale.

The way to realize the full human potential
According to Numerology, there is a great scheme of rhythm underpinning Nature and man being part of Nature has to act in harmony with this great scheme of rhythm if he is to realize the full potential as a human being.
Not only words and deeds, but also the colours of our attire should be in harmony with this great scheme of rhythm.

Mother Natures colour scheme
If you carefully look around you will observe a scheme of colours encompassing our environment. How humdrum would be the world without Mother Natures colour scheme!

In harmony with the Birth Number
Numerologists say that there are main colours that find harmony with the Birth Number and the colours you wear would heighten glamour of your personality if they are in harmony with your Birth Number. Besides, the colours or the colours in harmony with your Birth Number would have a soothing effect on your nerves. In fact, you would relax and sleep better in a room having a colour scheme in harmony with your Birth Number.
Now let us discuss the different colours that match or harmonize with different Birth Numbers.
Number 1 persons: - those born on the 1st, 10th, 19th, or the 28 of any month are advised to dress as far as possible all shades of White, Gold or yellow. They may blend or mix these colours with those recommended for Number 4, 2 or 7 persons. This is in accord with the Affinity concept we have already discussed.
Number 2 persons: - those born on the 2nd, 11th, 20th or the 29th of the month may wear all shades of Yellow and Cream. They should avoid dark colours, Black, Purple and dark Red.
Number 3 persons: - those born on the 3rd, 12th, 21st, or the 30th of the month should wear all shades of Violet, Blue, Rose (Pink), Mauve and Purple.
Number 4 persons: - those born 4th, 13th, 22nd, 0r the 31st of the month should wear all shades of Orange, Ruddy Gold, and Grey.
Number 5 persons: those born on the 5th, 14th  or 23rd of the month should choose colours or blends of colours from shades of Indigo, Green, Light Blue, White and Light Green. They should avoid dark colours.
Number 6 persons: those born on the 6th, 15th or the 24th   of the month should pick their colour or the blend of colours from among all shades of Pale Blue, Pink and Turquoise. Palest possible colours are the best for them.
Number 7 persons: those born on the 7th, 16th, and the 25th of the month are advised to wear colours similar to those recommended for Number 7 persons. Their principal colours are Green and Yellow.
Number 8 persons: those born on the 8th, 17th, or 26th of the month should wear the colour or the blend of colours from among Black, Deep Brown, Dark Blue and Purple. They should avoid light or gaudy colours.
These people given their personality, should pay special attention to their colours and surroundings. As these people are grave and serious by nature, they should always pick serious colours.
Number 9 persons: those born on the 9th, 18th and 27th of the month should pick their colour or the scheme of colours from among Red, Crimson, and Rose. However, they are advised to avoid darker shades of these colours. Number 9 people are known to radiate magnetic rays which irritate persons belonging to other numbers except those born under Number 1, 3, 5 and 6 and their own number. People born under other numbers are very nervous or uncomfortable in the presence of Number 9 people.

What to do following a nervous breakdown
	

The world we are living in is advancing rapidly. As a result the majority of us find it difficult to survive in this fast moving world owing to the competition that exists. 
The incidences of psychological issues and psychiatric illnesses are rising like never before. This is mostly due to the above mentioned competitiveness where people tend to spend most of the time worried, tensed and depressed. Sadly their aspirations in life are very high and theyll tax themselves to achieve these goals. 
Nervous breakdowns, emotional breakdowns and midlife crises are frequently used phrases nowadays. They describe the inability of an individual to function in an optimal manner as a result of psychological stress. However, this disturbance in the mind often goes without being diagnosed or untreated due to the confusion between the true illness and inherent personality traits. 
Medically defined as a modern health crisis, a nervous breakdown takes place as a result of stress or a distressful external influence or an experience such as loss of a loved one, divorce, unemployment, poverty etc. This psychological scenario is usually associated with underlying depression or anxiety and often owns a short lasting natural history. This condition in turn gives out responses which will signal an individual to seek medical advice or psychological support, as soon as possible. 
Signs and symptoms of a nervous breakdown may vary from one person to another, depending on their personality, skills of coping, experiences, age, etc. Most patients will present with signs of depression, anxiety, extreme mood swings, hallucinations, panic attacks, paranoia, social withdrawal and isolation and flash backs of the traumatic events. 
nDepression-Sudden drop of individuals mood which significantly differs from the default personality traits. He will also prefer staying alone, eat less or more than usual, show a loss of weight, experience sleep disturbances (either sleep a lot or doesnt sleep at all), get suicidal thoughts, suffer self-mutilation and lose interest in things he used to enjoy. These signs tell us that a patient should receive immediate professional care so as to prevent fatal consequences. 
nAnxiety and panic attacks-Extreme anxiousness following a traumatic event is highly suggestive of an emotional breakdown and affected individuals will present with high blood pressure, tensed muscles, frequent muscle cramps, trembling and shaking movements, dizziness, headaches and fainting attacks. 
nExtreme mood swings- unusual and unexplained outbursts of mood changes which might interrupt day to day activities of the individual, in a significant manner. In such scenarios it is important to exclude psychiatric illnesses like Bipolar disorder. 
nHallucinations- Experiencing a variety of sensory perceptions in the absence of any relevant external stimulus. These are very common in individuals with a nervous breakdown and often associated with underlying illnesses such as Schizophrenia or substance abuse. 
nParanoia- This is a significant sign of emotional breakdown where affected individuals will fear that someone is watching and following them, with a possible drawback of difficulty in coping up. 
nSocial withdrawal-Most of the individuals who have been brutally traumatized by negative life events and reached a state of nervous breakdown,prefer staying alone, avoiding any social interactions. They might just need some self-time to understand the situation they are experiencing and create the background to cope with the stressful situation. 

Coping with it is hard, but not impossible
The feeling of a nervous breakdown can be really devastating and sound serious, but what matters most is to manage it effectively so that the affected individual will not develop any negative consequences towards living a peaceful life. 
Identification or vaguely observing any of the signs described above, following a traumatic life event, can possible hint towards a nervous breakdown. 
This is where you should take action. May it be you, your neighbour, your friend or someone you barely know, it is highly recommended to seek professional care of a psychiatrist or psychologist to gain relevant support and medication since this type of care is highly important to prevent negative outcomes.

WhatsApp down for a brief period
	
The messaging App, WhatsApp has been hit by a major outage stopping millions of people from using it for a brief period around the world, the Independent reported a short while ago.
People couldn't send or receive messages using app owing to a server problem. However, the services are being restored gradually.
The app didn't initially look broken, with chats and contacts able to load. But once a user was into a chat, the app just showed a "connecting" message that never resolves itself, and so new messages couldn't be sent or received.
The website Down Detector showed a huge spike in problems with the app, suggesting that almost everyone is unable to get online. The problems are focused in western Europe and Asia, but were reported across the world.
There were relatively few reports of problems from the Americas, but that might simply be a result of the fact that timezones mean that many people there were asleep.
WhatsApp Web, which uses the phone's connection, was also broken.

WORDS ARE POWERFUL
	
We are very fortunate to be born as human beings. But we arent perfect. We have numerous inabilities and limited capacities. Numerous mistakes and lapses have taken place in our lives due to lack of mindfulness. Some are very sagacious and intelligent. There are gifted and talented prodigies.

Some members in our human family silently enlighten us and make us aware of our inherent potentialities, accumulated throughout our previous lives, having performed numerous wholesome kamma (good deeds). 
In this small piece of writing I compassionately thought of making others understand what we possess a stupendous and stunning ability within. But unfortunately many of us arent mindful of it. 
Words we speak are very powerful. We are extremely fortunate to have the ability to express our feelings and thoughts through words, using numerous languages. 
Every single parent impatiently waits to hear the first voice and the tone of his or her child. It makes them extremely delighted and joyful. If a child is weak, parents would be definitely perplexed and perturbed.

However, we must be extremely happy that we are able to express and articulate our views, thoughts and feelings perfectly. We should exercise this precious gift of speech very wisely. Because sooner or later our gifts such speech, vision, hearing, feeling and smelling will be taken away or weakened. This will be the moment of truth. 
The words that we speak disclose our true character. 
An old profound saying A mans conversation is the mirror of his heart reminds us of the true nature of person. 
Points to ponder
One should be certain about the idea behind ones own words before one starts expressing
	One must be mindful of every word that is written and spoken because they are very powerful.
	Words can hurt others as well as heal

Some are intoxicated and arrogant due to their academic achievements and the accomplishment of wealth. They pompously overstate and exaggerate facts which arent relevant to their own lives or that of others. Mostly I have noticed that the purpose of these academics is to belittle others. They impolitely and senselessly let others down by uttering insulting and abusive words. Unfortunately, we can see such behaviour in our political arena. Sometimes they boast of their paper qualifications with pride, but the words they use to speak with their family members and friends are repugnant and repulsive. None of their qualification helps them to refrain from usimg harsh words. How unfortunate it is to see them often try to deliver lectures on the subject of goodness. These people are very weak in reality despite delusively and fallaciously believing that they are superiors and exceptional. 
Anger and jealousy are very dangerous lethal mental impurities which lead human beings to dreadful and monstrous states. 
Words must be pleasant and soothing. They must be consoling and comforting. Inspiring and encouraging words are constructive and productive. They are called wholesome words. Bitter and harsh words are distressful and traumatic. They hurt a lot. 
The great Master, Gautama Buddha encouraged people to dissuade from unwholesome acts. He persuaded them to perform wholesome deeds. If one follows his advice, one will lead to a happy and peaceful life, here and hereafter. The truth is that no one can escape Karma. No one can avoid its outcome. It is like a never departing shadow.
 Mind precedes all mental states. Mind is their chief; they are all mind-wrought. If with an impure mind a person speaks or acts, suffering follows him like the wheel that follows the foot of the ox.

Once Gautama Buddha was highly appreciative of a person who had abandoned and abstained from using harsh speech. He comparing his action to honey.
Here some person, having abandoned harsh speech, abstains from harsh speech. He speaks such words that are gentle, pleasing to the ear, and are lovable. Such words enter the heart, are courteous, are desired by many and are agreeable. This is the person whose speech is like honey, Gautama Buddha had once said.
Once Gautama Buddha proclaimed that some people are prone to anger and are easily exasperated. Even if a person criticizes slightly he might lose his temper and becomes irritated, hostile, and stubborn, Gautama Buddha had said. The Enlightened One had added, He who discloses irritation, hatred and bitterness is akin to a festering sore and if struck by a stick will discharge even more matter.
Words must be pleasant and soothing. They must be consoling and comforting. Inspiring and encouraging words are constructive and productive. They are called wholesome words. Bitter and harsh words are distressful and traumatic. They hurt a lot
So these admonitions are the supportive factors to introspect oneself and to gravely understand ones own defilements. If one honestly concentrates on ones own freedom from suffering one will never generate any such excruciating pain in ones heart. 
The amazing veracity of Gautama Buddhas words is very impressive. They are accepted by multitudes of people. The Great Master never pronounced any harsh or abusive words even though he was abused and insulted by uncultured and undisciplined people, belonging to different faiths and beliefs. 
People who take refuge in the religion of Gautama Buddha must be very mindful of what they say. These are Gautama Buddhas instructions for Buddhists before they select their words for speech.
One should utter only such speech
By which one does not afflict oneself
Nor cause harm to others:
Such speech is truly well spoken.
One should utter only pleasant speech,
Speech that is gladly welcomed.
When it brings them nothing evil
What one speaks is pleasant to others.
Truth, indeed, is deathless speech:
This is an ancient principle.
The goal and the Dhamma, the good say,
Are established upon truth.
The secure speech which the Buddha utters
For the attainment of Nibbana,
For making an end to suffering
Is truly the foremost speech.
(The Buddha- Samyutta Nikaya)
