Cabinet agrees on 20A
	
Cabinet, at a special session today, decided to draft legislation by Friday, to implement electoral reforms as the 20th Amendment to the Constitution.
Though it had been proposed to increase the number of MPs to 255, Cabinet finally decided to maintain the number at 225 as at present, as insisted upon by the United National Party (UNP).
Cabinet instructed the Elections Commissioner and the Legal Draftsman to formulate the new legislation and submit it to President Maithripala Sirisena by Friday. Both the officials were present during yesterday's meeting.
The UNP had throughout been opposed to any increase in the number of MPs. Ultimately the entire Cabinet had accepted the UNP proposal.
The Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP), an Opposition party, had also opposed any increase.
It is now proposed to elect 125 MPs from the constituencies, 75 according to the Proportional Representation System by district, and the remaining 25 from the National List, under the new system. (Kelum Bandara)

Eurozone bank stress tests set for 2016: report
	
		 		 
		 
			
AFP - Europe?s banking supervisory board will carry out stress tests of big eurozone banks in 2016, according to an interview with the watchdog?s president Daniele Nouy released on Saturday.
?There will be a public and general stress test next year. It could only concern a part of the 123 banks that we supervise directly,? Nouy was quoted as saying by German paper Die Welt.
Nouy, who heads the European Central Bank (ECB) supervisory board, gave no details on how the tests would be performed.
Since November the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), an autonomous unit within the ECB, has been Europe?s banking watchdog and is directly responsible for monitoring 123 banking groups.
A stress test is a simulation of various scenarios of financial crisis that probes the strength of banks? balance sheets. Nouy also said: ?There is always smaller scale, targeted tests about specific risks. Whenever we ask a bank ?What would happen if... ?? It is a type of stress test.? The watchdog led an extensive review last year of banking assets in the eurozone and a stress test that revealed capital needs at roughly ten financial institutions in the region.

	Legal action should be taken against Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera for violating Sri Lanka's Penal Code by voting in favour of gay rights at the UN, National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader Wimal Weerawansa said today.
	He said the Foreign Affairs Ministry had voted against a resolution submitted by Russia calling for the withdrawal of benefits for gay and lesbian couples.
	?Being gay and lesbian-friendly has become our foreign policy today. This will result in negative consequences in the long run for Sri Lanka. It will affect our culture. Therefore, the minister should be arrested for violating the Penal Code,? Mr. Weerawansa told a news conference.
	Meanwhile, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila said right of equality doesn?t mean all groups are equally recognized.
	?Right for equality is something considered before the law. It means a person?s sexual orientation, religion or language should not be considered when making a legal decision on that person. It doesn?t mean all groups are equally recognized. It?s a wrong interpretation,? he said.
	The UN Secretary-General early this year issued an administrative circular that offered marital benefits to the UN's lesbian and gay employees as well as to its other workers who had entered legally recognized domestic partnerships.
	Subsequently Russia brought a resolution calling for the withdrawal of these benefits to same-sex couples. It was however defeated by a majority of vote including that of Sri Lanka.
	Clarifying the issue, Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Ajith P. Perera had earlier categorically denied that Sri Lanka had voted to promote same-sex marriages and said the circular in question was submitted by the UN Secretary General on a matter dealing with UN administration.

MS not in favour of no faith motion
	
	President Maitripala Sirisena is not in favour of entertaining the no confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and believes that the enactment of the 20th Amendment to the Constitution should take precedence over anything, Daily Mirror learns.
	The President reportedly expressed his opinion in this regard at a meeting with the leaders of the political parties aligned with the United People's Freedom Alliance(UPFA).
	The UFPA handed over the no confidence motion against the Prime Minister last Friday to Secretary General of Parliament Dammika Dasanayake with 112 signatures of MPs. If the motion is adopted, the Cabinet of Ministers stands dissolved. In such an eventuality, the President should pick up the MP commanding the majority support in Parliament as the next Prime Minister.
	According to sources close to the President, he is not for taking up this motion as a parliamentary business. Instead, the President is keen on the enactment of the electoral reforms in the form of the 20th Amendment. For that, a special Cabinet meeting has been scheduled for this evening. The sole purpose is to discuss electoral reforms to revert back to the mix of the First Past the Post System and the Proportional Representation System.
	According to the cabinet paper drafted in this respect, 165 MPs are to be elected from the single and multi- member constituencies. There are 59 MPs proposed to be nominated on the National List, and the rest to be elected under the District Proportional Representation System.
	However, some parties, both within and outside the government, are against the increase of the number of MPs. The President has agreed to incorporate the proposals of such parties during the Committee Stage of the debate. If the cabinet paper is approved by the Cabinet, it will be announced in the gazette notification to be presented later as a Bill in Parliament.(Kelum Bandara)

MS wants all parties to declare stand on reforms
	
	President Maithripala Sirisena requested all political parties to come forward within the next few days and declare their respective positions on the proposed electoral reforms. He stressed that the passage of the 20th Amendment to the Constitution (that would do away with the weaknesses of the Proportional Representation System) was the need of the hour.
	Addressing a public rally held in support of the 20th Amendment at Viharamahadevi Park last afternoon, President Sirisena went on to say that attempts to sabotage the passage of the 20th Amendment, or to prevent its presenation in parliament or scuttle it would be treason and a betrayal of the trust the people had placed in their representatives.
	"If the current electoral system remains for another few years in in this country, only those mudalalis who can spend millions on their election propaganda would enter parliament, and there would be no place in politics for educated, decent people who have a genuine desire to serve the people," he said.
	The country had seen the ill effects of unsuitable persons getting elected to parliament as a result of the current PR system. However the people of the country had given a mandate on January 8 to prune the unfettered powers of the Executive President and introduce a new electoral system through the 20th Amendment to the Constitution. By enacting the 19th Amendment, the absolute powers enjoyed by the Executive President were removed to a certain extent after 37 years of struggle. And it was a victory for all those responsible for the good work, he said.
	It was vital that the 20th Amendment also be enacted, with same enthusiasm that was displayed in approving the 19th Amendment, as only then could the people's aspirations be fulfilled and people's rights protected, he said.
	Opposition Leader Nimal Siripala De Silva, UPFA General Secretary Susil Premajayantha, Communist Party leader D. E. W. Gunasekara, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne and SLFP media coordinator Thilanga Sumathipala also spoke.
	The rally had been organised by the SLFP on the theme 'Let's Abolish the Preferential Voting System - Bring Victory to 20A'. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Video: People want army out of North: Vigneswaran
	
Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran said today the people in the North would be very happy if the armed forces were withdrawn from the Northern Province because of several allegations levelled against the army.
He told a media briefing at the National Dangerous Drugs Control Board (NDCB) head office where Public Order Minister John Amaratunga and NDCB Chairman Nilanga Samarasinghe held a discussion to educate the people on eradicating the drug menace that is taking root in the North.
Mr. Vigneswaran called for an impartial investigation to ascertain whether the continued deployment of the army after the 30-year armed conflict had ended was a contributory factor in the introduction and distribution of narcotics drugs in the Northern Province.
He said there was no such problem of heroin use in the province till 2009 when the 30-year war ended with the defeat of the LTTE.
"The northern people suspect that the spread of narcotics is an attempt by drug dealers to prevent the youngsters in the North from progressing in their education to curtail their sense of freedom and to be stunted in their work. We still have a lot of problems because of the long presence of the security forces. Our lands have been taken over by them, our cultivation, our fisheries, our businesses have been taken over by them and our women are not safe. The deployment of 100,000 army personnel is equivalent to one soldier to every four people. We will be extremely happy if the army is withdrawn,? Mr. Vigneswaran said.
Dr. Nilanga Samarasinghe said the Northern Province was not badly affected by narcotics, because the LTTE did not allow the drug trafficking business which was one of methods it used to earn funds to be carried out in Northern Province while they were peddling drugs in the South and overseas.
He assured that the mission to eradicate the drug menace would be carried out with equal vigour in all parts of the country.
Dr. Samarasinghe said an anti-narcotics force headed by Chief Minister Vigneswaran would be set up in the Northern Province and hotline will be available for the people to inform the police about the drug hideouts and drug dealers and peddlers.
Responding to Dr. Samarasinghe?s statement, Mr. Vigneswaran asked that in the same vein that if LTTE did not allow their drug trafficking business to take place in North till 2009, how did the drug menace take root in the North now when the security are in charge? This is why we want the forces to be removed from the North.
He said he requested Police Chief N.K. Ilangakoon to assist them to hold awareness programmes in schools where the children are educated on the hazards and menace of narcotics use. (Piyumi Fonseka)Video by Sanath Desmond

SANASA Bank PBT up 261% to Rs. 205 mn for 1Q
	
SANASA Development Bank PLC (SDB) recorded a 261 percent increase in its Profit Before Tax (PBT) for Q1 2015 over the same period in the previous year, closing the quarter with Rs. 205.45 million.?
Commenting on the results for the first quarter 2015, SANASA Development Bank CEO, Nimal C. Hapuarachchi said, ?We have increased our focus on our core cliental, improving our service offer and reach to serve them better. This approach is reflected in the positive results we have recorded in the first quarter of 2015. We expect this momentum to continue through the remaining three quarters as well.??
The Q1 performance builds on the momentum created in Q4 2014, which recorded a 450 percent increase in PBT. Interest income for the quarter rose 27 percent to Rs. 1.47 billion year-on-year (YoY). Net Interest Income rose to Rs. 814.54 million on YoY, up by 57 percent. The increasing demand for credit, contributing to the positive increase in interest income, while interest expenses only rose 3 percent to Rs. 660.82 million.?
The Banking segment of SDB?s business made up the bulk of the income, with the segment contributing Rs. 1.18 billion in interest income for the quarter, up from Rs. 807.96 million in Q12014.?
Meanwhile, loan impairment provisions dropped 25 percent in Q1 to Rs. 79.43 million. The decline in loan loss impairment is largely attributed to impairment reversals done in 1Q2015 on the recovery of long outstanding non-performing assets. The Bank was successful in growing its loan book to Rs. 37.69 billion in Q1 2015, an 18 percent increase over 4Q2014. The growth in loans also helped increase the Bank?s total assets to Rs. 46.36 billion, up 14 percent over the 4Q2014. A noteworthy fact is that from the total asset?
base, 95 percent are income generating assets.?
The Banking segment accounted for a significant part of the assets with Rs. 32.85 billion in Q12015, up from Rs. 18.24 billion in Q12014.?
On the liabilities side, deposits grew 16 percent to Rs. 35.16 billion in the quarter, reflecting the increased confidence placed by customers with the Bank and the management?s continued efforts to spread its reach to all segments, while also improving the services offered to its customers. Total liabilities for Q12015 increased 16 percent to Rs. 41.5 billion Quarter-on-Quarter (QoQ).?
The savings to deposit ratio was sustained at 22 percent throughout the period under review. The cost to income ratio improved to 48.01 percent in 1Q2015 from 62.05 percent in 4Q2014 resulting in its 2015 cost to income ratio improving to 22.6 percent on QoQ basis as at 31st March 2015.
Chairperson of SANASA Development Bank, M. S. Kiriwandeniya stated, ?Our longstanding commitment to our customers is reflected in the increase in the overall business. We have a civic responsibility to not only offer banking services to everyone, but also to support them with livelihood opportunities. We have done this since our inception and those customers today are in the SME category. This has given us the opportunity to grow with them and contribute positively to the national economy.?
The bank?s Tier 1 core capital ratio was at a healthy 13.46 percent, well above the minimum requirement at 5 percent. The total capital adequacy ratio was at 13.94 percent, above the statutory requirement of 10 percent.
The liquidity ratio of the bank improved from 21.61 percent as at December 2014 to 22.49 percent at the end of Q12015 and is well above the regulatory limit of 20 percent.
The Return on Equity (ROE after taxes) as a percentage rode to 16.73 percent in the quarter, up from 12.01 percent in the 4Q2014.?
The SDB, commenced operations in 1997, and now has a network of 83 branches. The Bank is now moving onto the next level of banking, which entails expanding services to gear itself to cater to the lower end of the SME sector.

Signatures on no-faith motion genuine: Nimal Siripala
	
	Opposition Leader Nimal Siripala de Silva today rejected government allegations that some of the opposition members had not signed the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
	He challenged the government to debate the no-confidence motion and defeat it if the government was confident that some of the 112 signatures were fraudulent.
	"If the government thinks that we don't have the required numbers to pass the no-confidence motion all it has to do is to table it in parliament and defeat it instead of threatening to dissolve the government," Mr. de Silva said.
	He said the opposition was keen to take up the no confidence motion against Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayaka on priority basis. Party leaders are expected to decide on the date and time to take up the no-confidence motion against Mr. Karunanayaka today.
	Referring to rumours that 35 members who signed the no-confidence motion had decided to withdraw their signatures through affidavits, he said none of them would be able to face the voters at the forthcoming general election and their defeat was certain if they did so.
	Mr. de Silva told the media that certain political parties which are afraid of electoral reforms were sabotaging the efforts of the President Maithripala Sirisena and the SLFP to pass the 20th Amendment to the Constitution while pretending to support it in public.
	"The electoral reforms was a pledge given by President Sirisena under his 100-day programme. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the President, the UNP and the JVP to get it approved in parliament before the next elections," he said.
	The SLFP expects the cabinet to approve 20A at the special cabinet meeting and submit it to the Supreme Court this week so that it can be presented in parliament on June 23.
	"The 20A can be debated and approved by the end of the month if the political parties support it. If they need to introduce changes it can be done at the committee stage.
	Quoting a newspaper report that Sri Lanka had 200 political prisoners, Mr. de Silva said not only the government but the global community has admitted what the previous government maintained from the very beginning that Sri Lanka did not have thousands of political prisoners as suggested by anti Sri Lanka elements.
	He said the government was using state funds for election propaganda and added the overtime for employees of the Water Supply and Drainage Board had been suspended and the savings used to give appointments to 800 new recruits recommended by UNP organisers and ministers.
	With regard to a national government, Mr. de Silva said the SLFP-led UPFA would form the next government with an absolute majority and Mr. Premadasa and his boss Ranil Wickremesinghe will have to keep their new suits in the wardrobe because they would be back in the opposition once again.
