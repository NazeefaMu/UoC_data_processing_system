A happy ending to a heated exchange!
	
The second in command in yahapalanaya created ripples of amusement in the House the other day when he referred to the presence of a ?Suhada Koka? (good-hearted stork) among them.
During the recent Budget debate, one Diyawanna member complained that another member had threatened him. This complaint triggered a racket in the House. Meanwhile, a certain senior member who had grown unusually sullen and aggressive of late joined the fray saying: ?In his case, he has only been threatened. In my case, I was once beaten up.? ?
?That was in the past,? said the second in command. ?None would lay his hands on our ?suhada koka? now.?
This sally brought forth a smile from the ?suhada koka? himself and the argument thus ended on a happy note.?

A son who has become a law unto himself
	
This meddlesome son interfering in all affairs in his father?s key Ministry has become a veritable pain in the neck of all employees, they say.
What is worse is that the son has intruded into the decision making ?process ?as well while the high officials concerned look on nonplussed and helpless.?
All purohitas generally conduct their Public Day in their political offices. However, this meddlesome son has taken the initiative to hold the father?s Public day at the Ministry itself.
The purohita in question has received numerous complaints about the ?bull in the china shop? conduct of his son, but he has so far turned a blind eye to this situation, they say.?

Changes to budget won't affect mid-term economic plan
	
	The mid-term economic development plan presented to Parliament by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will not be hampered despite amendments to several of the budget proposals, Deputy Minister Harsha De Silva said today.
	He told a media briefing that the mid-term economic plan would go ahead.
	?The midterm economic plan is like a ship that causes difficulties to those who are travelling in it whenever its direction is changed. Likewise the amendments brought to the budget are relief given to those who are affected as a result of the government?s effort to change the direction of the economy,? Dr. De Silva, who is also an economist, said.
	He said the main objective of the government was to introduce a system of economic devolution where the people would have a greater chance of deciding on economic development.
	Dr De Silva said the people should not be deceived by the misplaced ideologies spread by some intellectuals that the government was going to allow Indian professionals such as doctors and nurses would be employed in Sri Lanka.
	However, he said the government would introduce a new medical service in several modes where Sri Lankans could obtain medical treatment from Indian specialists without going to India by using modern technology while the second option would be for Sri Lankans to travel to India for treatment.
	Meanwhile, Dr. De Silva highlighted the fact that no Indian doctors or others would be allowed to carry out private practices in Sri Lanka.
	UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim said no other party or individual could claim credit for the amendments made to the budget proposals because the changes were decided by the Prime Minister during discussions he had with various stakeholders including trade union representatives.

CMC cries foul over Enrique?s ?Sex and Love? show
	
	The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) today alleged that a 'huge tax fraud' had been committed on the income earned from the Latin Musical Idol Enrique Iglesias?s ?Sex and Love Tour? live concert held last Sunday at the CR&FC Grounds.
	Municipal Commissioner V.K.A. Anura said this fraud had been revealed after an investigation was carried out by the CMC treasurer.
	He said the exact amount of the defaulted payment could not be ascertained yet because the accounts were still being finalised.
	?The tickets had to be approved and sealed by the Colombo Municipality. However, we had found that the organizers had sold some tickets which have not been in the sealed packets so that the real income generated from the concert is higher than the amount in the accounts they submitted to us. This is illegal,? Mr. Anura said.
	The Commissioner said legal action would be taken against the organizers of Enrique Iglesias' live concert ?Sex and Love Tour." (Piyumi Fonseka and Chaturanga Pradeep)

Double game that made way for bank strike
	
Government decided to obtain an injunction from courts against the recent general strike by bank employees and instructed an official of a leading state bank to take steps to obtain the court order.
The bank official did obtain the injunction against the bank union, but too late to prevent the strike. By the time, the injunction order reached the union, they were already on strike.
Many government high ups highly perturbed over the strike, wondered how the union went ahead with it when there was a court order issued against it. ?
Inquiries made later revealed that the bank head had initially dragged his feet on paying the court fees for the injunction order saying there were no ?financial provisions? for making this payment. ??
There was another sensational revelation: the bank bigwig is a consultant to several trade unions including the bank employees union.
By the way, more interesting details about the role played by the bank high up are in the pipeline, they say.?

	Dismissing allegations that she had threatened and assaulted a 26-year-old man who had been abducted by her support staff in a "Defender" vehicle, UNP MP Hirunika Premachandra said today that all she wanted to do was to prevent a family from breaking up.
	At a special media briefing yesterday evening, the MP, who is at the centre of the controversy, said that she wanted to help one of her staff members, as his family was about to be broken up by an outsider.
	Admitting that it was wrong for her support staff to carry out the unlawful act of bringing a person forcibly to her office, Ms. Premachandra said that if the injustice that that was done to her staff member was referred to the police it would have taken days for the matter to be resolved.
	She said the abducted man,, who was also married, had been having an extra marital relationship with the wife of one of her staff members who had two children.
	She said the abducted man had forcible taken away the wife of the staff member and was keeping her.
	When the staff member went with a group of people to talk to him at the drapery shop where he worked he had refused to come out. Then the group had dragged him out and had taken him from there, Ms. Premachandra admitted.
	The group had brought the man to her office in Kolonnawa and reported to her. She said she had tried to sort out the matter and advised him to end the affair as it would break up another family.
	When asked whether she did the right thing, as a responsible public representative, to interfere in a personal problem in such a manner, she said that all she wanted to do was to save a family.
	She added that she had willingly brought her staff members who were involved in the abduction to the police station along with the vehicle to cooperate with the police inquiry. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

They have fun over others? fun!
	
A group of Diyawanna members were having their usual fun time in the House lobby the other day. ?They were swapping anecdotes, most of them woven around romantic escapades of certain purohitas.
One member was saying, ??This one was holding her hand as usual. You have to guess who she is. All I can say is that she is an opposition member. The affair has gone the full distance??
?I suppose you people don?t know about the hot affair about this one of the same rank,? another member took his turn. ?He visits the building just opposite the ?in Colombo, practically every evening. That?s a property belonging to his Ministry. He doesn?t take any extra pain to cover his tracks, because he can always claim that he goes there on official business. Of course, there is no office functioning there. I understand that a young beauty and her housemaid are the only occupants of this building which has the appearance of a typical residence in this locality. I hope you can guess who our guy is!?
?I have heard about a raging affair of another high up,? another member spoke up. ?This one is a regular visitor to a high-end hotel close to Galle Face. However, he never uses the front drive to approach the hotel. He has a secret access to it, they say. ?He goes straight to the suite where his lady love is snug.?
?Do you want us to guess who that man is?? a member who so far played the audience somewhat angrily turned on the colleague. ?Why can?t you name him??
?If I reveal his name, one of you people might leak the story to the nosy media guys and we all would be in a soup. So I have to censor the name!? the member who was challenged replied.

	?
Out of the 17 beverage companies in operation, 13 are about to fold up under the weight of the special tax imposed on them by the Budget 2016. ?The closure of these companies would mean the loss of employment for a 10,000 to 15,000-strong workforce.
The industry leaders have already brought this situation to the notice of the authorities in the highest echelons, company sources say.
Meanwhile, there is hush-hush talk that a certain interested group is planning a visit to Aluthkade to unfold some unknown story about the bigwigs who are said to be behind the imposition of the massive tax.

Together in adversity
	
??Thieves dining at the same table? The above phrase which reminds one of the oft-used English saying ?Birds of the feather flock together? is really a coinage by some of our Diyawanna members.?
There are certain Diyawanna members from both sides of the House facing serious charges at several ongoing probes. ?These members dining together irrespective of their political differences at the Diyawanna canteen during the recent sittings had been a commonplace sight. This familiar sight had inspired some of their colleagues with a sense of humour to coin the phrase.?
However, these members dining together and exchanging friendly banter in a spirit of camaraderie at the canteen were often seen hurling epithets at one another across the floor during debates in the House.

Two are to get the chop at the re-shuffle in the offing
	
A possible Cabinet re-shuffle after January is the subject of widespread speculation in political circles these days.?
Several purohitas are to be moved out of their present portfolios in this re-shuffle, they say. Both the Big Boss and the Second in Command are said to be very unhappy about one of these purohitas. They also have received complaints about some wrong doings in a Ministry where this purohita?s son has been entrusted with some responsibilities.
Meanwhile, a government authority in the highest echelons had told a delegation from the legal profession that met him recently that he would no longer give his ear to this purohita.?
On hearing about his fall from grace, the purohita had sought forgiveness from the Big Boss, but the response he got gave him no consolation, they say. The bottom line is that his days in his portfolio are numbered!
There is another purohita who is already black-marked for his doings that had caused much embarrassment to the government top brass. He too is to be given the chop at the reshuffle in the offing, they say.?

Why did they go easy on bribe taker?
	
An instance where authorities had soft-pedalled an open and shut case of bribery has been reported from a key state corporation recently.
In this case, a young girl had called at a key state corporation to meet a high political authority. A security guard at the corporation who accosted the girl had inquired the purpose of her visit. ?She had named a certain political authority adding that she wanted to see him regarding securing a job.
The security guard who soon won the girl?s confidence had told her in a conspiratorial tone that he being an intimate of the political authority was in a position to help her, but he had to oil the palm of certain officials involved. Later the girl had given Rs.20,000 to the security guard who had promised to see that she would get the letter of appointment within a few days.
The girl had waited several days for the letter of appointment but in vain and realizing that something had gone wrong, she had called on the political authority to inquire about the delay.
On hearing the girl?s story about her encounter with the security guard and the rest of it, the political authority had immediately sent for him and reprimanded him in the girl?s presence.?
However, the corporation employees express their surprise that the case has been closed after transferring the security guard to a sub-station of the state corporation.
