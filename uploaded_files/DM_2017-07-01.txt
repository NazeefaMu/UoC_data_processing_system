Ananthy: First NPC woman Minister
	
Received lots of sympathy and empathy from the long suffering Tamil people of Sri Lanka. 
	After becoming a Provincial Councillor Ananthy Sasitharan chartered an independent course in politics that often fell afoul of the TNA hierarchy position. 
	Ananthy stated that she had personally witnessed his surrender to the armed forces at a point near Vattavaahal in the Mullaitheevu District. She was a Govt. employee at the Kilinochchi District Secretariat at the time she deposed before the LLRC. 
	Nevertheless a wife trying to trace her missing husband was very justifiable and few found fault with her for that. The sight of a single mother with three young daughters seeking the truth about a husband and father aroused much sympathy. 
	A movement claiming to fight for the liberation of the Tamil people was holding its most vulnerable component in bondage and exposing it to danger and hardship. 
	There is no evidence of Ananthy colluding with Ezhilan in these acts of conscription, but she does not seem to have objected to them either. 
	Ananthy had much interaction with them. Some NGOs found her useful in helping to mobilise women with disappeared families and utilise them for demonstrations. Other organisations had hopes of manipulating her and controlling her. A few wanted to display her as their trophy. 
	A new window of opportunity opened out as elections to the Northern Provincial Council became a distinct certainty. ITAK General Secretary and TNA strongman Somasundaram Senathirajah alias Maavai approached her and asked her to contest on the TNA ticket. She readily agreed. Subsequently Maavai began having second thoughts about his overture as TNA leader Rajavarothayam Sampanthan raised objections. 
	Then came Shritharans intervention on Ananthys behalf. Strengthened by Shritharans endorsement Senathirajah ignored Sampanthans objections and granted nomination to Ananthy - wife of Ezhilan-as TNA candidate from Jaffna. 
	Volunteers working for Ananthy were reportedly provided with food, refreshments, transport and an allowance of 500 rupees per day. Obviously hidden hands were financing the campaign. Ananthy herself told people that relatives from abroad were helping her. 
	In the recent No Confidence Motion crisis in the Northern Provincial Council Ananthy took a stand against her fellow ITAK Northern Councillors by extending support to Northern Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran. 
	Subsequently she has been appointed a Provincial Minister. Whatever the backdrop against which this has been done, there is no denying that Ananthy Sasitharan has made history as the first woman Northern Provincial Minister.


By D.B.S.Jeyaraj


Ananthy remains at the interface of two contradictory positions-as the wife of senior LTTE leader Ezhilan, who was reportedly involved in several Human Rights violations and crimes against humanity. At the same time it is a fact that her husband who surrendered himself to the Army in May 2009 is now missing. 


45-year-old Ananthy Sasitharan made history when she was sworn in before Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray in Jaffna as Northern Provincial Minister of Womens Affairs, Rehabilitation, Social Services, Food Supply and Distribution and Industries on June 29th 2017. 
Ananthy, who will celebrate her birthday on September 10th has set a record of sorts by becoming the first woman to be appointed as a Northern Provincial Minister. She was elected from the Jaffna District in the first Northern provincial election with the second highest number of preferential votes polling 87,770. (Incidentally her name is spelled in the media in different ways such as Anandhi, Ananthi, Ananty and Ananthy. The official Northern Province council website spells her name as Ananthy. Therefore I am also using the same). 
It is a well known fact that Ananthy Sasitharan is the wife of Sinnathurai Sasitharan alias Major Ezhilan who was a senior leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). She herself refers to him frequently in public. Ezhilan (also spelled as Ellilan) had reportedly surrendered - along with a number of fellow tiger leaders  to the armed forces in the Mullaitheevu District in May 2009. There is no information about their fate and all of them, including Ananthys husband are regarded as missing or disappeared. 

The political wing dealt out inhuman punishment on the civilians apprehended while trying to flee. Ezhilan played a significant role in all these. Even though Ezhilan was involved in such barbaric conduct, civilised norms stipulate that even persons who commit heinous crimes against humanity at one level are entitled to protection under the law at another level

Ananthy captured national and international attention by a determined campaign demanding information about her husbands situation. This resulted in her receiving lots of sympathy and empathy from the long suffering Tamil people of Sri Lanka. The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) cashed in on this by fielding her as a candidate of the Ilankai Thamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK) in the September 2013 Northern provincial elections. She won handsomely with the second highest tally of preference votes in Jaffna. 
After becoming a Provincial Councillor Ananthy Sasitharan chartered an independent course in politics that often fell afoul of the TNA hierarchy position. Later she was suspended from the ITAK on disciplinary grounds pending inquiry. 
This has not deterred the irrepressible Ananthy, who continues with her particular brand of controversial politics. 
In an earlier article about Ananthy Sasitharan, I described her as vibrant and wrote thus - Ananthy Sasitharans political ambition is not a factor that can be dismissed lightly. Even her critics acknowledge that she is a tenacious woman who pursues her objectives with single minded determination.
Recent events have proven me correct. Ananthy achieved political success as an elected Provincial Councillor in 2013. Four years later she has reached a significant milepost in 2017 after being appointed provincial minister. 
The circumstances of Ananthys romance with Sasitharan alias Ezhilan and her marriage to him serve as testimony to the first woman northern Provincial Ministers steely resolve. 
People who are aware of what happened in those days say in lighter vein that Ezhilan had no chance whatsoever once Ananthy had set her sights on him. Those events and other matters concerning Ananthy Sasitharan such as her politics, have been related earlier in these columns but are still worthy of being re-visited in the present context. 

Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission
It was in the aftermath of the war that Ananthy Sasitharan first grabbed attention as the wife of Ezhilan. She presented herself before the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) in 2010 when it held sittings in Kilinochchi and testified that her husband had gone missing after May 2009. Ananthy stated that she had personally witnessed his surrender to the armed forces at a point near Vattavaahal in the Mullaitheevu District. She was a Govt. employee at the Kilinochchi District Secretariat at the time she deposed before the LLRC. 
That disclosure made her a sensational figure then. This was the first time after the war that the spouse of a senior LTTE leader had been bold enough to come before a Commission and testify that her husband had surrendered and was now reported missing. 

When Ananthy conveyed her feelings to him through intermediaries he rejected them immediately. Ananthy however persisted and finally met him face to face and proffered her love. Again Ezhilan turned it down saying he was wedded to the ideal of Tamil Eelam and advised her to concentrate on her studies.

Speaking to the BBC Tamil Service after her testimony Ananthy related her version of what had happened then. Ananthy said that when her husband Ezhilan went with other senior LTTE leaders to surrender, she and the three children had walked behind. 
She said that she saw her husband being identified as Maavilaaru Ezhilan. 
According to Ananthy an Army officer had asked her to turn back and surrender along with other Tamil civilians as she was a Govt. employee and assured her that Ezhilan would be released later. Whether true or false Ananthys testimony before the LLRC and her subsequent media interviews did make a powerful impact. 
LTTE media organs amidst the Tamil Diaspora derived maximum mileage out of her testimony. It later came to light that Ananthy had been encouraged and supported by TNA Parliamentarian Sivagnanam Shritharan to go public and testify before the LLRC. 
Nevertheless a wife trying to trace her missing husband was very justifiable and few found fault with her for that. The sight of a single mother with three young daughters seeking the truth about a husband and father aroused much sympathy. 
Besides there was a romantic touch as the Sasitharan-Ananthy union had been a love story of sorts. 
Ananthy was born on September 10, 1971 to parents hailing from the Kankesanthurai and Chulipuram areas in Jaffna. She was the fifth in a family of six children. Her elder sister Vasanthi who joined the Eelam Peoples Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) had been killed by the LTTE at Kurumbasitty in 1989. Some years later Ananthys younger brother had joined the LTTE. He went missing after a while and is presumed to have been killed in combat. 

Victoria College in Chulipuram
Ananthy was a student at Victoria College in Chulipuram, when she first saw Ezhilan who was then in the LTTE. He was from the Atchuvely area in Jaffna. Ezhilan was then active in the political wing of the LTTE. He had come to Victoria College to deliver a lecture to the students. It was customary in LTTE-controlled areas then for LTTE cadres to address students in their respective schools. 
Ezhilan with his dashing looks made a positive impression on young starry-eyed Ananthy. Also, the progressive views he expressed in his lecture on matters such as caste, dowry and womens rights impacted greatly on her. It was a case of love at first sight for Ananthy. But that was not so for Ezhilan. When Ananthy conveyed her feelings to him through intermediaries he rejected them immediately. Ananthy however persisted and finally met him face to face and proffered her love. Again Ezhilan turned it down saying he was wedded to the ideal of Tamil Eelam and advised her to concentrate on her studies. 
Ananthy was not one who gave up easily. She kept on trying to win Ezhilans heart. In the meantime, she finished her secondary schooling and began pursuing accountancy studies. She gave up studies after getting a Government job. Ananthy started working as a clerk at the Jaffna Kachcheri from June 10, 1992. She worked at the Valigamam West AGA office in Chankanai from 1993 to 1996. 
During these years her passionate ardour for Ezhilan did not diminish. Determined to win her hearts desire Ananthy kept on persevering. Finally Ezhilan melted. But soon there was another problem. The Sri Lankan armed forces regained control of Jaffna through Operation Riviresa in 1995-96. The LTTE, including Ezhilan relocated to the Northern mainland of the Wanni. Ananthy too followed soon after. She worked at the Mullaitheevu District Secretariat as a clerk from 1997 to 2003.Thereafter she began working at the Kilinochchi District Secretariat as a Management Assistant from 2003 onwards. She continued to retain that job until obtaining a release in 2013 to contest the Northern Provincial poll. 
Ezhilan too began rising up in LTTE ranks as a political wing member. He was a particular favourite of the LTTE political wing chief Suppiah Paramu Thamilselvan. Ezhilan was made Political Commissar of the Vavuniya district by Thamilselvan with the approval of LTTE supremo Prabhakaran. After the Cease Fire Agreement (CFA) came into force in 2002 Ezhilan was transferred to the politically sensitive Trincomalee area as LTTE Political Commissar. 

Maavilaaru river blockade
The Oslo-facilitated Cease Fire Agreement (CFA) had begun crumbling after 2004. The decisive turning point was in the Trincomalee District when the LTTE blocked the Maavilaaru River in the Moothoor region and prevented water from flowing into Sinhala inhabited areas. 
This was in July 2006. Ezhilan played a prominent role in justifying this decision and gave many media interviews about the river Maavilaaru and the importance of the blockade. 
Hence he came to be known as Maavilaaru Ezhilan. The war escalated due to the Maavilaaru episode ultimately resulting in the Mullivaaikkaal debacle. 
Ezhilan and Ananthy got married on June 6, 1998 at Mulliyavalai in the Mullaitheevu District. LTTE political chief Thamilchelvan presided over the ceremony. 
Ananthy continued to work in Mullaitheevu and Kilinochchi during the time Ezhilan was stationed in the Vavuniya and Trincomalee Districts.
After being driven away from Trincomalee, Ezhilan and other tiger cadres relocated to the Northern Wanni. Ezhilan began working in the LTTE secretariat in Kilinochchi. Ananthy working at Kilinochchi Kachcheri, stayed together with her husband. 
The LTTE political wing members were at the forefront in conscripting youths based on the dictum Veetukku oru veeran allathu veeranganai (A hero or heroine from each home).Excessive force and sheer cruelty was shown in this conscription drive. These acts have been publicised by this columnist in earlier articles. After Thamilselvans death in November 2007, Ezhilan was placed in overall charge of recruitment which was in reality conscription. 
Ezhilan and Thamilini the woman political wing chief, acquired a notorious reputation for forcibly recruiting young men, women and children in the years 2008- 2009. 
The LTTE escalated its conscription to very high levels after being restricted to the Puthukkudiyiruppu and Karaithuraipattu AGA Divisions in the Mullaitheevu District. Ezhilan continued to play a terrible role in this along with other senior LTTE political wingers. 

As the war continued to intensify along the Mullaitheevu coast the trapped civilian population was in a tragic hostage situation. 
A movement claiming to fight for the liberation of the Tamil people was holding its most vulnerable component in bondage and exposing it to danger and hardship. It was during this time of an unfolding humanitarian catastrophe that this writer appealed repeatedly through these Daily Mirror columns to Let my people go. 
Those pleas however fell on the deaf ears of the LTTE and what happened thereafter is now history. 
During this tragic phase of war when the Tamils of LTTE-controlled areas were regarded as the wretched of the Wanni earth that the political wing of the LTTE descended into despicable levels. 
The LTTE political wing was involved in three tasks even during those perilous times. 
Firstly the political wing continued to forcibly recruit youths and children in huge numbers. 
They were thrown into war as cannon fodder without adequate training or experience. Secondly the LTTE political wing acted repressively to prevent civilians from trying to escape from LTTE controlled areas to SLA controlled areas for reasons of safety and security. 
Thirdly the political wing dealt out inhuman punishment on the civilians apprehended while trying to flee. Ezhilan played a significant role in all these. 

Involved in barbaric conduct
Even though Ezhilan was involved in such barbaric conduct, civilised norms stipulate that even persons who commit heinous crimes against humanity at one level are entitled to protection under the law at another level. 
Even a notorious violator of human rights is eligible to have basic human rights such as the right to life and can be penalised for alleged crimes only after due process of the law. 
What then was the role of LTTE spouses like Ananthy, when their dearly beloved life partners embarked on sprees of mass Human Rights violations and crimes against humanity against the very people on whose behalf they claimed to wage war 
There is no evidence of Ananthy colluding with Ezhilan in these acts of conscription, but she does not seem to have objected to them either. 
When a newspaper asked her during the election campaign about conscription by the LTTE she avoided a direct answer but sought to condone or justify it indirectly by stating that one segment of the population cannot distance itself from fighting when another segment was in the thick of war. 
Ananthy Sasitharan remains at the interface of two contradictory positions. As the wife of senior LTTE leader Ezhilan, who was reportedly involved in several Human Rights violations and crimes against humanity, she is at one end of the spectrum. At the same time it is a fact that her husband who surrendered himself to the Army in May 2009 is now missing. 
In that sense Ezhilan is a victim, and so are his wife and family. Thus Ananthys current situation is complicated, being the wife of a person who is both a perpetrator of human rights violations as well as a victim. 
The Ananthy-Ezhilan couple have three children; all of them girls. The eldest Nalvizhi was born on May 23, 1999.The second Ezhilvizhi was born on 22 November 2001.The youngest Kayalvizhi was born on July 15 2003. 
The family left Kilinochchi when the SL Army advanced and moved to the Mullaitheevu District. After the war ended in 2009, Ananthy and the children stayed in an IDP camp for a while and relocated to Kilinochchi where she resumed working as Management Assistant in the Samurdhi Department at the District Secretariat. 
The children were sent to Chulipuram in Jaffna while the mother shuttled between both places. It was in Kilinochchi that Ananthy came under the sway of Shritharan MP who encouraged her to testify before the LLRC. 
Apart from the media, the LLRC exercise also attracted the attention of several Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO) and International NGOs concerned with issues such as disappearances and womens rights. 
Ananthy had much interaction with them. Some NGOs found her useful in helping to mobilise women with disappeared families and utilise them for demonstrations. Other organisations had hopes of manipulating her and controlling her. A few wanted to display her as their trophy. 
Initially she went along with these organisations but soon it became apparent that Ananthy had an independent agenda and would not play second fiddle to another. The interaction with these organisations resulted in writs of habeas corpus being filed in courts by Ananthy along with some other women for their respective family members who had allegedly disappeared. 

Champion of Human Rights
Ananthy now began involving herself with NGO activities concerning women and families of disappeared and/or missing persons. She was a fixture at demonstrations often enjoying huge media attention. This resulted in some ill-will between grassroots activists and Ananthy who was accused of gaining publicity without any constructive input while they who did the spadework were ignored. There was also resentment in some circles about the wife of an LTTE leader posturing as a champion of Human Rights. 
A new window of opportunity opened out as elections to the Northern Provincial Council became a distinct certainty. ITAK General Secretary and TNA strongman Somasundaram Senathirajah alias Maavai approached her and asked her to contest on the TNA ticket. She readily agreed.
Subsequently Maavai began having second thoughts about his overture as TNA leader Rajavarothayam Sampanthan raised objections. Then came Shritharans intervention on Ananthys behalf. Strengthened by Shritharans endorsement Senathirajah ignored Sampanthans objections and granted nomination to Ananthy - wife of Ezhilan-as TNA candidate from Jaffna. 
It was felt then that being a mother of three children whose husband had gone missing, Ananthy would strike a responsive chord among women. 
Besides, the phenomenon of a wife fighting for the life of her husband or seeking justice on his behalf was sure to evoke sympathetic feelings in the Tamil psyche. 
Hindu mythology relates the tale of Savithri who locked horns with Yaman, the god of death, and won a reprieve for her husband Sathiyavaan. 
The Tamil epic Silappathikaaram narrates the saga of Kannaki (Pathini Deiyyo), who sought justice for her husband Kovalans death from the Pandya King and in its absence, burnt down Madurai city. 
Ananthy in that context could be depicted as a latter day combination of Savithri and Kannaki. 
If one school of thought opted to project Ananthy as a figure eliciting sympathy, another school of thought, comprising die-hard tiger elements, opted to support her for another reason. As the wife of Ezhilan she was identified with the LTTE. If she won with a huge preference poll then that victory could be portrayed as a triumph of the LTTE and justification of the LTTE. 
A third school of thought threw in their lot with Ananthy because they though her success would strengthen the hands of international forces, who were seeking an indictment of the then Rajapaksa regime in the tribunal of world opinion. 

Well-endowed campaign to boost Ananthy
Thus the stage was set for a well-endowed campaign to boost Ananthy Sasitharans capacity to harvest the maximum number of preferential votes. Abundant advertisements in the newspapers, colourfully attractive posters, proliferation of pro-Ananthy leaflets and flyers became the order of the day. 
Vehicles with loudspeakers went about the streets of Jaffna blaring forth ultra-nationalistic Tamil songs and slogans in support of Ananthy. A battalion of youths wearing tee-shirts with Ananthys name, face and candidate list number rode around on motor cycles. Volunteers working for Ananthy were reportedly provided with food, refreshments, transport and an allowance of 500 rupees per day. Obviously hidden hands were financing the campaign. Ananthy herself told people that relatives from abroad were helping her. 
Four other developments relating to Ananthy Sasitharan during the polls campaign also helped boost her campaign. The first was a public protest demonstration by some rehabilitated ex-LTTE members, who carried placards and shouted slogans critical of Ananthy Sasitharan. She was the only TNA candidate against whom a demonstration of such a nature was conducted. 
The second development was a reported incident near Chunnakam in Jaffna. Ananthy was returning home after in the night after intense canvassing when a VIP motorcade passed her vehicle. A person on a motor cycle following the VIP vehicle tried to attack Ananthys vehicle. A heavy object was thrown at the vehicle, damaging it. Apparently the damage was minimal and no further mishap occurred. 
The third development was reportedly far more serious. A gang of armed men some in uniform - attacked her residence in Chulipuram and damaged the house, furniture and parked vehicles. At least eight of her campaign staff were assaulted severely and had to undergo hospital treatment.
Fortunately, Ananthy and her three daughters had jumped over a rear wall and escaped to a safe place shortly before the attack began. Fearful of an impending attack Ananthys campaign staff had compelled her to leave with the children as a precaution. 
This incident received much publicity as there were many media personnel in Jaffna then to cover the historic provincial poll. Ananthy Sasitharan was the focal point of local, national and international media attention and became famous overnight. Ananthy accused the Eelam Peoples Democratic Party (EPDP) of being responsible for the attack. This was hotly denied by that party. Interestingly the TNA hierarchy then did not conduct an official party press conference featuring Ananthy Sasitharan, which could have resulted in deriving much political mileage. 

A fake Uthayan newspaper
The dawning of polling day on September 21 2013 saw the fourth Anandhi-related election development occur. This was not one of a violent nature. It was an exercise in duplicity. A fake Uthayan newspaper with the same format as the original newspaper was printed with the sensational news that Ananthy Sasitharan had deserted the TNA and crossed over to the Government. The fake Uthayan news aroused much interest but was dismissed with disbelief and contempt. The Jaffna voter was not to be conned so easily, as the forces responsible for the counterfeit edition had naively expected. 
The duplicitous exercise however did churn a wave of sympathy towards Ananthy Sasitharan. Why was this woman alone being singled out as a target among the many TNA candidates Was it a case of the Tamil saying Kaaitha maram thaan kalladi padum (Only fruit-bearing trees are stoned).Whatever the motives behind the attacks on Ananthy, the cumulative effect was the formation of a massive sympathy wave. So huge was the perceptible sympathy that Ananthy Sasitharan came second with 87,770 votes. C.V. Wigneswaran polled the highest number of preferences from Jaffna. 
Ananthys victory had a stunning effect on many people, particularly some Western diplomats. One woman envoy from a powerful nation was particularly impressed and had a meeting with Ananthy, who had acquired a larger than life image after her victory. 
This enhanced image has resulted in Ananthy being a highly sought-after trophy at Tamil Diaspora gatherings. 
After being elected she has visited the USA, Germany, Denmark and Norway. In Germany she testified before the Permanent Peoples Tribunal at Bremen. In Sri Lanka she had a meeting in Jaffna with Stephen Rapp former US Ambassador-at-Large for War crimes Issues and the ex- US Ambassador in Colombo Michele J. Sison. All three posed for the camera after the meeting. Ananthy also testified in Kilinochchi at the Presidential Commission to probe disappearances. 
In recent times Ananthy Sasitharan has been a constant visitor to Geneva, where she has been engaging in propaganda efforts against the Sri Lankan State. Domestically she has fallen foul of the ITAK hierarchy. She has been a fellow traveller of elements antagonistic towards the leadership of the ITAK which is the chief constituent of the Tamil National Alliance. 

No Confidence Motion crisis
In the recent No Confidence Motion crisis in the Northern Provincial Council Ananthy took a stand against her fellow ITAK Northern Councillors by extending support to Northern Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran. Subsequently she has been appointed a Provincial Minister. Whatever the backdrop against which this has been done, there is no denying that Ananthy Sasitharan has made history as the first woman Northern Provincial Minister.

Asias tallest tower to be built in SL
	
The World Capital Centre (WCC) signed a US$ 2 billion investment agreement with the Board Of Investment (BOI) yesterday, for the much hyped and long awaited tallest building in the Asian region and the 9th tallest to be in the world.
The World Capital Centre also known as WCC is a globally renowned chain with its operations spread across the world and will be the centre of multiple trading and service providing establishments, having an astonishing twin tower with modern amenities of 117 floors, gracing a height of 625 metres to be built in the heart of Colombos commercial area. It will include 1,200 residential units, 2,000 hotel rooms, 3,000 retail outlets, 5,000 car-parking spaces, the WCC 7-star hotel, 20 luxurious swimming pools, gold presidential suites with gold-plated interiors, worlds fastest double-decker elevators, first Michelin starred restaurant in Sri Lanka, stunning observation deck and a helipad on the topmost floor. 
The signing ceremony was represented by the Chairman of BOI - Upul Jayasooriya and the other senior officials of the BOI while WCC was represented by its key figure heads, the Chairman of WCC - Ahmed Moulana, Deputy Chairman of WCC - Vivekanandarajah A. Moorthy, Director of WCC - Dr. Senaka Silva, Director of WCC - Dr. Arosha Fernando, Director of WCC - R. Sadesh Kumar, Director of WCC - Wijendran Balakrishnan, MD of WCC - Imran Saleem, CEO of WCC Media - Shafraz Jalaldeen, and the Secretary of WCC - Waruni V. Ranasinghe.
This proposed building would be the tallest in Asia and the 9th in the world as accepted by the Skyscraper Centre of U.S.A., and will be the largest tower in the world having a total built up area of 800,000 square metres first of its kind in Sri Lanka, which would be an ultimate tribute to Sri Lanka as well as in the Asian economy, expected to be completed by end of year 2022. Sri Lanka being centrally located in South Asia is perfectly poised to be the launch pad for the Capital Centre owing to all the bilateral trade agreements, close ties with the developing nations and the long trade history with the rest of the world.
While many international banks have been operating in Sri Lanka for decades, the ending of the war has seen the expat community blooming together with large multinational companies looking to invest in new businesses or to open up branches. Within the region, Sri Lanka is very easy to do business with and eventually has the potential to become what Dubai is to the Middle East, what London is to Europe, what Singapore is to South-East Asia or what New York is to the Americas.
WCC intends to be the first financial centre to offer an innovative vehicle for investment companies to have their South Asian base here in Sri Lanka giving an extraordinary boost to the economic development of the country.(Mirrorbusiness)

GMOA to complain against Neville Fernando
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) yesterday said that it would file a complaint with the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Pujith Jayasundara on Monday against SAITM Chairman Dr. Neville Fernando regarding alleged threats issued by him to the doctors, while speaking to media outside the Presidential Secretariat last Tuesday.
GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said Dr. Fernando had made these alleged threats after a discussion held with a Secretary to the President over the issues with regard to the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).
Dr. Fernando has threatened us by provoking the public to go against the doctors. His threats can be considered as a threat over a trade union. Currently we are having discussions with our legal officer regarding this matter, he said.
Meanwhile, Dr. Aluthge said that their decision on the sudden work stoppage would be crucial with the end of Professor Carlo Fonsekas tenure as the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) President yesterday.
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne is in an attempt to solve the SAITM issue by removing Professor Fonseka from this post. We will commence the second phase of the battle against SAITM if the Minister would do so, he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

MR govt. never approved SAITM: Gammanpila
	
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila yesterday said even the former government headed by former president Mahinda Rajapaksa had never approved of the SAITM and it had functioned in an illegal manner since the past.
MP Gammanpila said he was against the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) from the very inception.
It is an utter lie if anybody claims that the former president's government had approved of the SAITM. The former government only imposed several conditions on the SAITM and it failed to fulfil them, he said.
He said many developed countries in the world had no private universities for medical education. He also claimed several countries including India, Nepal and Bangladesh have such universities and the health sector in those countries was in a crisis due to the low standards in medical education.
Meanwhile, he said his party would continue its struggle against SAITM until a reasonable solution was given.
The government is in an attempt to solve this issue by suppressing university students. The government is also trying to cover up its weaknesses by using the judicial system of the country. The government should understand the fact that this issue cannot be solved through judiciary since this issue has been politicized, he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

OBOR will increase SLs financial connectivity
	
Chinas One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative will not only help develop infrastructure in Sri Lanka but will also increase the countrys financial connectivity and other economic possibilities, a Chinese think-tank said.
Liu Zongyi, a Senior Fellow of the Shanghai Institutes For International Studies (SIIS), which is a government-affiliated high-caliber think tank, said this upon meeting a group of visiting Sri Lankan journalists in the city on Thursday.
He said apart from the hard infrastructure such as building of ports, highways and economic zones, the initiative would increase Sri Lankas financial connectivity and other economic possibilities.
He also said Chinas investment in Sri Lanka stimulates other countries also to invest in the country.
China and Sri Lanka has sound cooperation. We share a very good traditional friendship. We have capital, capability to help Sri Lanka. I think on the other hand, the demand comes from Sri Lanka to develop it. After years of civil war the country needs infrastructure building and economic development, he said.
Meanwhile, the President of the SIIS, Chen Dongxiao said he would lead a team of experts from China to Sri Lanka in autumn to have a discussion with their counterparts in Sri Lanka at the joint research centre of the two countries.
One centre of the joint research centre, which was established recently, is situated in China while the other is in Sri Lanka. (By Lahiru Pothmulla in Shanghai)

SAITM issue could have lasting impact on medical education: FUTA
	
The Federation of University Teachers Associations (FUTA) yesterday warned that issues involving the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) would have a lasting impact on medical education in State universities, leading to a delay in the conduct of degree courses.
FUTA Additional Secretary Dr. Athulasiri Samarakoon told Daily Mirror that many university students now boycott lectures to participate in protests against SAITM and that this had been going on for too long.
This will State universities badly, leading to considerable delays in students passing out as well as delaying future enrolments of students to State universities, he said.
While condemning the suppression of university students by the government, Dr. Samarakoon said the government should provide a reasonable and clear solution to the SAITM issue without prolonging it any further for the sake of the country.
He also said the discussions among the university teachers were ongoing regarding the action that should be taken in the future. University teachers attached to several medical faculties had recently gone on strike to protest against SAITM, he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

## Title: Thank you!  - A nicety of life

Thank you!  - A nicety of life
	

Thank you is indeed a polite expression used when acknowledging or accepting a gift or service, be it to hitch a lift in someones ride or picking up a dropped parcel, or even when it comes to a compliment. It is also used when accepting or refusing an offer like a dinner invitation or piece of cake. There are some sardonic characters who would say it when you offer something they dislike or they might like it but not when it comes just from you. 
When a Thank you is uttered, it would warm the heart of the doer who would have spent many hours or days preparing the offer. Often, they would end up disappointed if their efforts are not appreciated. When not many people are humble or refined enough to say a mere Thank you, saying it would be greatly cherished, especially by the ladies. The writer, who was once a teacher, born and bred in a country and culture where saying thank you was something alien. He was more than pleased when one of his students showed up after the very final English class before his London O/L exam to say how grateful he was. 
(This article is coloured by the writers own experience not because he likes to blow his trumpet, but because he feels substantiating what he says with his own experience would convince the readers; truth is stranger than fiction, they say)
The Bible says Jesus prayed for ten lepers and sent them home. When they reached their abodes, they were all healed, but only one turned up to thank Him! This shows that even during those days, the practice of saying Thank you was not ingrained in many people, so much so that one of the writers friends exhorted him to write on this topic. At present, it is not so well-known in our paradise isle where every prospect pleases, but only man is vile. 
Saying Thank you is a good way of showing appreciation. It sets the stage for good relationships. In villages, people say thank you with a smile. Among the elite, it would look rude when what you had done for the person is not appreciated.
We teach our children good manners when they are small. This includes saying a simple Thank you when someone does something good to you. But things surely turn around with time. While the French say Merci becoup for Thank you, in Germany it is Dankesehr. Hindus and Maldivians say Shookriya while we in this emerald isle Sri Lanka say Bohoma sthoothi or Ubaharam.
The writers late father used to relate a tale where a woman boarded a crowded bus and was not offered a seat for a long time until a gentleman did. She fainted, recovered and said Thank you. Then the man fainted.
A Swedish couple lived with the writers parents when he was young. They said it was the Swedish custom to stand up after each meal and thank anyone who offered it. So they used to say Tucksu miku meaning Thank you, and our parents would reply Ta ha Ta ha probably meaning it was alright. This was a good practice to show parental care was appreciated -- something most of us take for granted.
The writers maternal uncle would drive Thank you into the heads of his nieces and nephews. If they do not say Thank you after receiving a gift or help, he himself would keep on saying Thank you, Thank you until they did.
Of course there are hundreds of educated people to whom saying Thank you is unknown. When the writer was teaching abroad, another teacher used to blame him for observing formalities. He would over-stress the r in the word formality, much to the writers amusement or, sometimes, contempt. Another person under whom the writer was working was highly impressed that he thanked the doer for each and every gesture. After a lapse of about six months, he said: One thing I learnt from you was to appreciate another persons efforts and say Thank you. The writer quipped: Why dont you thank me for that. 
The writer had his entire education in an American mission college where he was trained to observe all formalities. Saying Thank you was convenient and they even used to send appreciation cards. 
Once, he was teaching a girl whose father used to come home late at night and had no time to talk to his daughter. But noticing that the teacher kept company with her daughter, the mother thought of showing her appreciation by an additional payment that month. Following the receipt of it, the writer sent her a Thank you card.
Christians are enjoined to thank the Lord for all the good things in life. They are obliged to thank the Lord before every meal. Church hymns are full of Thank you songs. Apart from that, popular singer Jim Reeves composed a song titled We thank thee.
The writer makes it a point to say Thank you to his family members for each and every help like bringing him a cup of tea. This puts to right the minor differences of opinions that might arise in domestic affairs. When in a joyous mood, he repeats a line from My fair lady, Thats very nice of you, how very kind of you.
More often than not, when the writer says Thank you to a trishaw driver, he is smart enough to respond Welcome.In the olden days, it was usual to say Dont mention. Now it is no longer in vogue. It is as dead as a dodo.
The writer wishes to conclude his article with an absurdity for the readers to ponder--- Thank God , Im an atheist!(said an atheist!)
Thank you, dear readers, for reading this! That was very kind of you, how very nice of you!
