Ayurveda  the Science of Life
	


Ayurveda is derived from the sanskrit words ayush meaning life and veda meaning science. Ayurveda is an Indian health science which is not just limited to medical aspects and treating disease but also focuses on the wellness aspect, maintaining health and improving quality of life. Its not about living without any illness but how to live physically, mentally, spiritually and socially and leading a happy and healthy life. Ayurveda texts explains health as;

sama dosa, sama dhathu, sama agni mala kriya  prasanna aatma indriya manas swasta ityabhideeyate
The balance of active components [body physiology], structural components [body anatomy], metabolic components, waste product functions [altogether balance of physical body] and the balance and well-being of spirituality, sensory organs and mental functions [altogether balance of psycho-spiritual body] is considered a healthy state. In the modern day too, the world health organization defines health as:  
Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.(http://www.who.int/about/definition) 
It is quite interesting to take this definition of health or a healthy state into consideration. We can all agree that not having a physical, structural or functional abnormality or imbalance can be considered healthy. Sama dosa means the balance of the three dosas of the body, namely vata  pitta and kapha. Ayurveda believes that the body is made up of these 3 dosas and body functions are controlled according to their characteristics and qualities. Balance doesnt necessarily mean that a person should have all these dosas in equal amounts. Ayurveda believes in equity rather than equality. Meaning that, if a person is born with certain proportions of these three dosas, maintaining those proportions throughout their lives and not letting the dosas aggravate or diminish causing abnormality and disease during their lifetime can be considered sama dosa. This is explained further in Prakirti or Natural Body Constitution, according to Ayurveda. 
Dhatu means body tissues. According to Ayurveda, there are 7 main body tissues. Namely, rasa [body serum/fluids], rakta [blood], mamsa [muscles], medas [fat tissues], asti [bones and cartilage], majja [marrow] and sukra [reproductive tissue]. This definition encompasses a broader meaning than the direct translations. Sama dhatu again doesnt mean that everybody has to have these tissues in equal proportions but in proportion to function well and to live a complete life. 
Sama Agni is a very interesting concept in Ayurveda. It is the balance of metabolic activities in the body. Lets call it good digestion. Whatever is ingested into the body has to be digested well and should be utilized well too. That is, if you eat something, it needs to be properly digested in the gut and the nutrients need to be properly used too. If you eat more than your use up, there can be an excess of food stuff, leaving undigested parts in the body. These are what are later turned into toxins and cause disease. Therefore, having good digestion is a very important bodily function. Or according to Ayurveda, Sama Agni. Sama mala is having a balance in waste products. That is to say, whatever you consume has to be properly digested and excreted. Not just mass wastes but micro wastes, that are generated as a result of digestion and metabolism, and should not be left inside the body but passed out. Otherwise, they can become toxins and cause illness. If nutritional substances in the body are passed out as waste, that too is bad. As in the case of Diabetes mellitus, glucose is passed out with the urine. Glucose is a nutritional substance that is useful to the body. When any nutritional substance is passed out, it is not normal. Then it is a disease or imbalance of mala. 
Lets talk about well-being mentioned as psychological and spiritual aspects of a human. Prasanna aatma or well balanced lively spirit is an important part of a healthy person. If your spirit is weak, depressed or negative, then you are unhealthy. People should be happy and pleasant in their daily lives. Sadness, anger, jealousy, greed and other negative thoughts and feelings are deviations of this normalness. They may occur in certain situations but should not to be maintained consistently. Also having harmful thoughts towards others - humans, animals or even the environment is not normal. Abuse, addiction and such are also abnormal and can be considered a disease. Therefore, Prassan aatma and Prasanna manas, spiritual well-being and mental balance, taken together as one unit are important factors of health. We will talk more in detail about it in the future. 
Prasanna indriya is the well-being of the sensory organs. Apart from the 5 main sensory organs we commonly know- eyes, ears, nose, mouth (tongue) and skin, there is also the mental eye or the sixth sense. The sixth sense is intuition or gut feeling. The sense of right and wrong, cultivated from the above mentioned prassan aatma and manas. 
Basically health is being good to yourself as well as others in your society, including animals and the environment you live in. It is not simply living without an illness. It is a much more rich and wholesome concept. Living is not just a period between birth and death but enjoying a fulfilled life. 
So my wish for everyone is to have a fulfilled life.

BASL President  in hot water  on judicial appointment
	
Appointment of a High Court Judge from the Unofficial Bar
The thorny issue on the appointment of the High Court judge from the Private Bar is brewing fast at a rapid phase, with conflicting statements, from various sources. Justice R. Kandiah Kannan is appointed from the Batticaloa Private Bar, allegedly on the recommendations of the Bar Association, which is the only statutory body of Attorneys-at-law in Sri Lanka established in 1974 with the merger of then professions Advocates and Proctors creating a powerful professional body of renamed as Attorneys- at  Law, which catalysed and initiated the formation of the Organization of Professionals which is the professional body of the majority of recognised professional associations in Sri Lanka. The powers of appointment of High court Judges outside the accepted and legal procedure is laid down in the Constitution to be enforced on special circumstances strictly on the advice of the Judicial Service Commission established under the same chapter. It is a mandatory requirement that the JSC should advice the President on the appointment on their own initiative and merits of the candidates free from influence or interference of political or other considerations. It is not clear on what basis the JSC could select candidates from the service, which is the normal procedure. 
The Law Article 111(1)
There shall be a High Court of Sri Lanka, which shall exercise such jurisdiction and powers as Parliament may by law vest or ordain. ] (2) The Judges of the High Court shall be appointed by the President of the Republic by warrant under his hand and be removable and be subject to disciplinary control by the President on the recommendation of the Judicial Service Commission established under this Chapter. (3) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2) of this Article, Parliament may by law provide for matters relating to the retirement of the Judge of such High Court. It is abundantly clear that the President has the mandate to make the appointment at his wish and will. 
Article 111(A) Commissioners of the High Court.
Where the Minister in charge of the subject of Justice represents to the President that it is expedient that the number of the Judges exercising the jurisdiction and powers of the High Court in any judicial zone should be temporarily increased the President may, by warrant, appoint one or more Commissioners of the High Court to exercise the jurisdiction and powers of the High Court within such judicial zone as is specified in the warrant of appointment of such Commissioner of the High Court. This procedure permits Ministerial intervention unlike the previous Article in which the it is not imperative, but always complementary in the practice of good governance. 
112(1) The Judicial Service Commission
There shall be a Judicial Commission which shall consist of the Chief Justice, who shall be the Chairman, and two other judges of the Supreme Court appointment of the President of the Republic. 
It is clear that the President has power to appoint High Court Judges at his will and following conventions and practices which are discretionary. 
A Constitutional Requirement
Though not a constitutional requirement, it is generally the practice and the convention to consult the Minister of Justice and the Bar Association as a matter for safety, courtesy and guidance to the President in such appointments on exceptional situations. Whether this procedure was followed previously is a mot issue though it is not in the public domain, it is obvious and imperative that the Judicial Service Commission shall recommend with the Attorney General is nod as the advisor of the State and the President. Then how was the appointment initiated, and recommended to the Judicial Service Commission, as JSC can recommend the appointment to the President only from and among 66 serving judges awaiting for promotions, who apparently have shown the strong protest by refusing to take part as returning officers at the BASL election which is postponed indefinitely which is considered to be a matter of serious nature. By Convention the Judges act as returning officers of BASL elections and the AG on the apex body in conducting and supervising election procedure. 
President made it clear in the presence of the President BASL, and the Chief Justice at a function that Bar Association has made a request, when the Minister of Justice denies of any knowledge or involvement on any such appointment. Presidents position is substantiated by a statement by a group of lawyers responsible for the Regime Change, using the phrase Upon a nomination by the president BASL, and not from the Executive body, recommendation was made which is unconstitutional and irregular as the President BASL is bound to act strictly on the advice and directions of the Executive Body alone. He cannot take arbitrary decisions which are illegal and unconstitutional. 
Issue has become still complicated by the statements of the former President and former Foreign Minister alleging involvement of a political party in the recommendation process requesting the President to make the appointment under his powers and prerogative, which is rarely used. Making matters worse the Secretary of the Bar Association has denied any involvement or connection by the Secretary as the Chief Executive officer. Bar Council which is the Executive Body of the Bar Association deciding on all issues pertaining to the Association. Neither the President of the Bar Association nor the Social and active groups except a pro-government group of lawyers have made any comments or statements, on this thorny issue of paramount importance to the independence of Judiciary. Dead silence by the social groups active in the campaign of good governance and independence of the Judiciary is raising eyebrows of the public awaiting action on the issue close their hearts of adjudication of justice and maintenance of Rule of Law. 
Logically and constitutionally citizen is bound to believe the convincing statement made by the President on the issue and it is clear that the Bar Association should not dabble in politics or appointment of judges. Bar Association had an ugly history in dabbling in politics and the citizen still remembers by the BASL in the role played in the Regime Change process, for which the President of BASL was amply compensated with a plum office, and using USA aid by allowing them to function in the BASL premises and using data which are confined to the Lawyers alone. The Hulftsdorp Gossip is that the current Leader BASL is looking for a plump diplomatic appointment in a powerful western state, by killing two birds with one stone. Judges are appointed from and among the official and unofficial Bar with strict procedures adopted by the JSC alone with no political or any kind of interference. Head of the State and the Executive is expected to perform the sacred duty of the appointment of judges with great care, and impartiality appointing fit and proper learned and respected in the profession. 
First Appointment of this nature based on Article 111(A)
The President made an appointment of appointing a retiring High Court Judge under Warrant for a specified period, despite protests from the Bar Association, after she discharged Hon. Ravi Karunanayaka from the charges on a technical ground on the controversial case involving millions of foreign dollars connected to disgraced Raj Rajaratnam - a USA ballooner national of Sri Lankan origin. The current appointment is the second appointment under the first part of the Article, which is rarely used in extreme circumstances. Protest from the Bar was not considered seriously. 
Judges unhappy
Judicial Service Association which is the only body of the serving Judges have shown the protest on the appointment for reasons left to themselves and as a result the BASL election is postponed indefinitely for want of returning officers, which is a serious matter that may ignite further unless immediate steps are taken to remedy as there appears to be no constitutional remedy on an appointment made by the President despite technical defeats.
It appears that the Judicial Officers Association will stick to their guns, with displeasure and unpleasantness growing among the minor judiciary, depending on job security and due promotions they toil for during their service of employment. 
A Noble Profession/Way forward
The legal Profession is one of the noblest professions depending on the good will and reputation with the society maintaining highest integrity of individual members and the association collectively. President of the Bar Association is the Leader of the Unofficial Bar when the Attorney General is the Leader of the Official Bar all of whom are selected by and among the lawyers of high repute and professional standings, who are expected to be whiter than white in their personal and professional conduct before the public, judges and litigants, where the integrity is judged by the conduct of the member of the profession. In this instance we are in the dark until the tip of the ice bag is wide open by concerned parties in high office for the benefit of the citizen waiting for justice, fair play and remedies for laws delays and justice they are clamouring for with defective systems and want of facilities and learned judges and judicial system on the tract. Leader of the Bar should be responsive, responsible and live up to the expectations of the Nation, Judiciary and the members of the profession elected the leader with the highest expectations expecting no shady deeds or deals with ulterior motives or personal gains by acting arbitrarily and independently when there are clear guidelines to follow the due process.
As all those involved in this issue are members of the legal profession, apart from the President holding sole authority on appointments members of the Bar and the citizen expects the parties concerned to shed light to the public, and we as a part of the concerned citizens request the NGOs and Active social groups demanding good governance to take the campaign over in this matter of public interest and importance in promoting independence of the judiciary, rule of law and good governance.

Bond issue: Dispute over date of gazette notification
	
A dispute pertaining to the date of issue of the gazette notification concerning the Treasury Bond issue has led to the suspension of the recording of evidence by the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Bond issue. The Commission directed the investigating officers, today, to obtain a statement from the government printer to ascertain the actual date.
This dispute arose while the secretary of the Ministry of Finance, Dr. L. H. S. Samarathunga was giving evidence and the recording of his evidence was postponed for February 27th.
When Samarathunga was being questioned by Senior Sate Counsel Avanthi Perera regarding the gazette notification No. 1895/19, it transpired that the gazette notification covered the period 01/01/2015 to 31/12/2015, and Samarathunga said that on 01/01/2015 he was not the secretary to the Ministry of Finance and that P. B. Jayasundera was the secretary.
This point made the commissioners to examine the relevant gazette notification and they were surprised on seeing this date.
Additional Solicitor General Dappula De Livera, addressing the commission, submitted there was no issue with regard to the date, as all Bonds issued during the period 01/01/2015 to 31/12/2015 were compiled and a gazette notification issued at the end of the year. Therefore this date had been included accordingly, he said.
However, the commissioners stressed that it was necessary to establish how this date had been included in the gazette notification, and it was necessary to obtain a clarification from the Government Printer in this regard. They directed the investigating officers of the commission to seek clarification from the government printer.
The commission comprises Supreme Court judges K. T. Chithrasiri and Prasanna Jayawardene, and former deputy auditor general Velayudampillai. (Manopriya Gunasekera and Ranjan Katugampola)

CBK denies statement on military
	
The Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) today categorically denied the response by Military Spokesman Brig. Roshan Seneviratne that former president Chandrika Kumaratungas statement about the army sexually exploiting Tamil women, would jeopardise the reconciliation process.
The ONUR said in a statement that Ms. Kumaratunge did not make a statement as alleged by him and at no point had she accused the military, as a whole, of sexual exploitation of women in the North.
It appears that the news reports refer to a meeting Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, Chairperson of ONUR, had with the Foreign Correspondents Association (FCA) in Sri Lanka. We are surprised that a senior Army official has not thought it fit to peruse and understand the news reports of a statement allegedly made by a former Head of State and Commander in Chief, the statement added.
ONUR is an institution that is coming under the purview of the Commander in Chief, President and is chaired by Ms Kumaratunga. It would have been good practice and common courtesy for the Director  Media of Army Headquarters to seek clarifications from ONUR before rushing to issue a statement, it said.
She further stated that ONUR has been made aware of the fact that there is sexual abuse still going on by officials, demanding favours even to sign a document, even some Tamil officials, some Grama Sevakas and some people in the forces, and this needs to be dealt with sternly, it said.
It is ironic that the incidents of physical abuse referred in the statement by the Army are all incidents regarding which Her Excellency Chandrika Kumaratunga initiated action in her capacity as the Commander in Chief during the period up to 2005. It is also interesting to note that the Army Media Directors statement does not speak of a single incident of violence regarding which any action was instituted by the authorities after Madam Chandrika Kumaratungas tenure of office, the statement said.

Coping with Exam stress
	

QWhat health implications could rise due to exam pressure and how can it affect the mentality of young children
Exams and their aftermath affect children in different ways. While some children thrive, some appear to suffer. Children with an anxious temperament are likely to anticipate and worry about the worst outcomes at an exam. Worry itself can affect the ability to concentrate and make studying even more difficult. Others with obsessive temperaments will sometimes try to get perfect results. As they have a tendency to avoid things they cant do perfectly, this may lead to an avoidance of exams and school if they feel they cannot achieve what they want.
It has now been shown that chronic stress can affect the developing brain and alter our responses in adult life. The neural circuits that deal with stress are known to change with chronic stress. This can lead to a poorly regulated stress response system later life. Exam stress can also be considered chronic stress for some, as there is a long drawn out period of preparation and anticipation before the exam itself.

QHow can parents help their children overcome such exam stress
While exams are important, in the real world, resilience or the ability to overcome difficulties is more crucial. To be resilient, children need to feel secure in their attachment to their parents. Thus, children should feel that their parents are happy with them and will support them no matter what their outcome at the exam!
Parents can also help by teaching their children important skills in planning and organisation. Having other things going on in your childs life is also important, so that the consequences of exams are not the only thing in their world.
It is a good practice to be available to talk to your child at an emotional level. This is so that when they do feel stressed, they will be able to communicate this with you. All too often, we see that children are unable to communicate and internalise their distress, becoming sad, angry, withdrawn and even developing symptoms like headaches.
Finally as Donald Winicott, a famous child psychoanalyst said, what a child needs is not a perfect parent but a parent who is good enough. In todays unforgiving world of exams, it is necessary to be forgiving of both yourself and your child.

DFCC Bank 4Q profit jumps 74% but core banking under pressure
	
Specialized project financier turned a fully-fledged commercial bank, DFCC Bank PLC, saw its December quarter (4Q16) earnings soaring 74 percent from a year ago to Rs.759.1 million or Rs.2.86 a share, largely supported by trading and other incomes, provision reversals and notable decline in overheads other than staff costs, the interim results showed.
Both the net interest income and net fee and commission declined by 6.0 percent and 38 percent, to Rs.2.7 billion and Rs.358.5 million, respectively.
It appears that the margins have come under pressure as a result of the rising rates but the interim report did not include such ratios. 
This is despite the bank expanding its loans by a relatively strong Rs.26.6 billion or 15.6 percent to Rs.192.5 billion. DFCC maintained its strong presence in project lending with the bulk of loan growth coming from project loans, which increased by Rs.8.9 billion followed by trade loans, which increased by Rs.5.9 billion, the bank said in a post-earnings release.  
The steeper fall in net fee and commission income is baffling when the loans have a recorded a healthy growth compared to its peers. Meanwhile, the deposits grew by little under 27 percent or Rs.29.6 billion to Rs.140.2 billion. The low-cost deposits measured by the current and savings account (CASA) ratio slightly improved to 20.2 percent from little under 19 percent a year earlier.
DFCC Bank is an outlier in the industry as others saw their CASA ratios denting
in 2016. DFCC Bank also raised Rs.12 billion via a Rs.5.0 billion senior debenture in March and Rs.7.0 billion through a subordinated debenture issue in November 2016.
For the year ended December 31, 2016, the banking group reported earnings of Rs.12.88 a share or Rs.3.4 billion, an increase of little under 70 percent.
This is the first full financial year since the DFCC Bank amalgamated with DFCC Vardhana Bank on October 1, 2015 to form a fully-fledged commercial bank after the proposed merger between the DFCC banking group and NDB Bank PLC was
abandoned halfway.
For the full year, the net interest income rose by a strong 25 percent to Rs.8.9 billion and the net fee and commission income grew by a modest 14 percent to
Rs.1.3 billion.
Trading gains improved as a result of the gains made from foreign exchange trading and trading of government securities.
The net gain from financial investments was Rs.1.16 billion, the bulk coming from a dividend of Rs.712 million from DFCCs shareholding of Commercial Bank of Ceylon.
Meanwhile, the bank improved its asset quality through, recoveries from substantial hard core debts following diligent remedial action and the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio has also come down to 3.0 percent from 3.7 percent, the bank said in its statement probably referring to the
gross NPLs.  
DFCC Bank remained well capitalized with both Tier I and Tier II capital adequacy ratios remaining at 14.6 percent and 17.5 percent, respectively, well above the industry minimums of 5.0 percent and 10.0 percent, respectively.

Ex-DIG Anura Senanayake to be quizzed by CID over abductions
	
The CID told a Colombo Magistrate today that their investigations into an incident of abduction of several persons by unidentified groups in Colombo and the surrounding areas in 2009 had revealed that former Western Province DIG Anura Senanayake had prevented the CCD from arresting former Navy Lieutenant Commander Sampath Dayananda
The CID said they would record a statement from Mr. Senanayake at the prison premises on February 28 over this allegation.
The CID said that the then CCD DIG Nuwan Wedisinghe had enlightened that when the CCD wanted to arrest Dayananda for the abductions, DIG Anura Senanayake had prevented them from doing so..
The CID also said that even though they had asked Mr. Dayananda to come to the CID to record his statement he is absconding the CID by alleging that he is under going training in an unknown destination. However the CID had given him two weeks time to come to the CID to record his statement.
The OIC of the CIDs Gang Robbery Unit-Inspector Nishantha Silva had informed Court that former Navy Intelligence Director Ananda Guruge and Lieutenant Commander Sampath Dayananda, attached to the Welisara Navy camp would be arrested with regard to the abductions and disappearances of Vadivelu Pakkili Sami Loganathan and Rathnasami Paramanandan.
Meanwhile, , Navy Intelligence officer Lieutenant Commander Dhammika Anil Mapa attached to the Welisara Navy camp was arrested for allegedly abducting Vadivelu Pakkili Sami Loganathan on November 1, 2009 and was yesterday further remanded till March 9.
Inspector Nishantha Silva had nformed Court that the van of Vadivelu Pakkili Sami Loganathan was found at the Welisara Navy Camp cut into 72 pieces.
However, Presidents Counsel Anil Silva defending the suspect had denied allegations levelled against his client but admitted the fact that the Navy Intelligence Unit had taken the vehicle into their custody following a report that it contained bombs concealed and the Navy was compelled to cut into pieces for the purpose of searching explosive substances.
The CID said there was no legal provision vested with the Navy to carry out such a step and the Navy should have brought the matter to the attention of police and to the bomb disposal unit.(T.Farook Thajudeen)

Mr. Grero said there was no need to react to anonymous emails and assured that standard security would be provided to the competition, students and all attendees.
The ISAC is being organised by Gateway College and the Lyceum International School alternatively. Each school gets an opportunity to organise the event for three consecutive years and Lyceum International School is the host for this year as well.
Mr. Grero said they were focused on the education of the students and expressed optimism that the event would be concluded successfully without any hiccup.
However, amidst this speculation, several international schools including the Asian International School (AIS) and the British School-Colombo had pulled out their athletic teams from ISAC.
"We are sorry this happened but it's for the best," AIS Director/ Principal Mrs. Goolbai Gunasekara said.
Meanwhile, ISAC Secretariat at Lyceum said it was a 'rumour' which had been spreading but still, all school heads had decided to beef up the security at the competition.
"There is no need to panic. It's just a rumour. Nevertheless, we have decided to increase security," it said.
Meanwhile, the Chairman of the International Schools of Sri Lanka (TISSL), Dr. Harsha Alles said he had requested all heads of the member schools to try their best to take part in the ISAC -- which is considered as the flagship event of the international schools sports calendar.
Dr. Alles said it was not very nice if the schools continue to withdraw from the competition. We have organised the ISAC even during the time of the war when there were direct threats. My opinion is that schools should try their very best to participate and maximum security should also be provided, he told Daily Mirror.
Dr. Alles, who is also the Chairman of the Gateway Group of Organisations, said they had put a great deal of effort, time and energy to keep the ISAC going.
He said a good majority of member schools had confirmed that they would participate in the athletic competition which was founded by veteran educationalist R. I. T Alles.
Commenting on the anonymous email, Dr. Alles said acts of this nature could happen to any organization in any country.
Nevertheless, we should not take the situation lightly. I have requested the Lyceum, this year's organiser of the event, to provide the maximum security for the event. In fact, they are scheduled to hold a meeting on Friday with the law enforcement authorities, including the Police, he said.
Several attempts to contact the Police on this matter, failed. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

If not, we will compel them to come to us, he said. Khalid said police believed five North Koreans were heavily involved in the murder. Four of the men fled the country on the day of the killing while one remains in custody in Malaysia.

MR urges Maithri to condemn CBKs allegations
	
Former president Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratungas allegations that war widows face sexual exploitation by members of the army among others should be condemned publically by President Maithripala Sirisena, former president and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa said today.
Issuing a statement, he said Ms. Kumaratungas allegations were a matter of grave concern and the Armys statement rejecting these allegations did not carry any weight.
When a former president and commander-in-chief makes such a statement the person who should respond should be the current President and the Commander in Chief. Therefore, as a former president and commander-in-chief, I urge the President to publicly condemn the statement made by Ms. Kumaratunga, he said.
Mr. Rajapaksa said the government should also seriously consider whether Ms. Kumaratunga is fit to be the head of the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) because she was using that position to tarnish the image of the armed forces of Sri Lanka.
Since Ms. Kumaratunga holds the position of head of the ONUR which functions under the Presidential Secretariat, the statements she makes goes to the world as the official position of the Sri Lankan government, he said. 
Mr. Rajapaksa said the rape and sexual exploitation of women in the war zone both during and after the war was one of the main unsubstantiated accusations made by two irregularly set up investigations against Sri Lanka within the UN system  the Darusman report of 31 March 2011 and the Navi Pillai/Zeid Al Hussein report of 16 September 2015.
The latter report had a whole chapter of about ten pages devoted to the subject of rape and sexual exploitation, he said.
Now, with days to go for the 34th Sessions of the UN Human Rights Council, a former President of Sri Lanka and a former Commander in Chief of our armed forces says that our armed forces are sexually exploiting war widows in the north. What we have here is a former President echoing the accusations made by our enemies in what is obviously a deliberate attempt to vilify our armed forces on the eve of the UNHRC meeting, he said.

Myth: Sugar causes hyperactivity in children
Busted: No, this is a myth. Hyperactivity in children can be precipitated by various things and a high sugar diet doesnt cause it. Hyperactivity can be precipitated by caffeine and other artificial agents or chemicals like food colouring added to food items. On the contrary, if there is a lack of sugar in the body, they can have a problem. A lot of children become hypoglycemic, that is they lack sugar due to the heat, and their sugar drops during the night. When they wake up, they get confused and even convulsions can occur. High sugar as a disease can lead to diabetes but eating a lot of sugar wont make children hyperactive. Explained Dr. Kosala Karunaratne, Consultant Pediatrician, Lady Ridgeway Hospital.

NDB mulls fresh capital infusion as December quarter profits slip 42%
	
The National Development Bank PLC (NDB) group, a leading project lender in the country, saw its performance being negatively affected by the rising interest rates as the loan growth slowed significantly while the margins remained stubbornly lower as the low-cost fund base narrowed.
According to the interim results filed with the Colombo Stock Exchange, the banking group reported earnings of Rs.726.1 million or Rs.4.40 a share, down 42 percent on year. 
The rise in net interest income (NII) was only 10.5 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs.2.3 billion as the interest expense rose much faster than its corresponding income as the bank responded late to the rising interest rates and waited before it re-priced its Rs.234 billion loan book, last year.
The net fee and commission income also slid by 15 percent YoY to Rs.803.4 million, which the bank attributed to the lesser than anticipated capital market activities during the year.
NDBs capital market cluster contributes a sizable share to the group. The segmental analysis showed the groups capital market operations suffering a massive set back as its operating profits fell 45 percent to Rs.402.3 million.
Meanwhile, for the financial year ended December 31, 2016, the banking group reported earnings of Rs.16.29 a share or Rs.2.7 billion, a decline of 24 percent YoY. The bank on a standalone basis expanded its loans and receivables by a modest 8.7 percent or Rs.18.7 billion, bulk of which were driven by the infrastructure-related project lending, the bank said in an earnings release.
This makes difficult for the bank to fetch higher margins as such lending generally is disbursed at low interest rates.
The deposits grew by 10.2 percent or Rs.19 billion to Rs.203.9 billion but the low-cost deposits, current and savings account (CASA) ratio declined to 22 percent. Falling CASA is a common issue faced by the entire banking sector as the savings deposits shifted to time deposits seeking higher returns when the interest rates started to rise.  The net interest margin stood at 2.64 percent, little changed from 2.63 percent a YoY, about 80 basis points less than the industry average.   NDB now has a new Chief Executive Dimantha Seneviratne, who took the reins just under two months ago. Seneviratne is largely credited for turning around Pan Asia Bank, a mid-sized listed bank, before he joined NDB. Meanwhile, during the year, specific provisions on bad loans rose sharply by 96 percent to Rs.1.1 billion due to one off provisions for few customers. 
Also, NDB said infusing fresh capital is a key strategic priority during 2017 to prepare for higher capital requirements under BASEL III accord and also to support growth. The banks Tier I and Tier II capital adequacy ratios stood at 9.31 percent and 12.95 percent, respectively. In December 2016, Standard and Poors downgraded NDB to B from B+ with a Stable outlook, based on weaker capital.
The controversial primary dealer, Perpetual Treasuries, has increased the stake in NDB during 4Q16 to 7,352,180 shares or 4.45 percent of bank from 6,153,686 shares as at September 30, 2016 being the seventh largest shareholder. The government held slightly above 30 percent stake in NDB through Bank of Ceylon, the Employees Provident Fund and Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation.

PTA used to hunt down intelligence officers
	
The Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) is being used only to hunt down army intelligent officers whereas legal actions against suspected terrorists are being taken under the general law, the joint opposition (JO) said.
Addressing the weekly news briefing, Prof. G. L. Peiris said the five suspects who were arrested in connection with an assassination attempt of an MP should have been arrested under the PTA.
Since these suspects had not been arrested under the PTA, there are obstacles to keep them in detain and question though it had been revealed that the LTTE Diaspora in four countries were behind the assassination attempt. They have even provided funds to these suspects, he said.
However, he said, the PTA had been utilized without hesitation to arrest a number of army intelligent officers. This will make an adverse impact on the mentality of the security forces personnel, he said.
He said the situation would only aggravate with the setting up of the Office of Missing Persons which has a mandate to directly deal with international non-governmental organisations. Intervention of NGOs will pose a threat to National Security ultimately, Professor Peiris said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

SL Police after refugees who sheltered Snowden in Hong Kong
	
Sri Lankan asylum seekers living in Hong Kong fear they are being illegally pursued by police after sheltering the US whistleblower Edward Snowden in the city.
Criminal investigators from Sri Lanka are believed to have visited Hong Kong looking for them, their lawyer said.
The Sri Lankan police have denied the allegations.
Law enforcement authorities from mainland China or other countries have no jurisdiction in Hong Kong.
The lawyer representing the men, Robert Tibbo, said that at least two officers from the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the Sri Lanka police visited Hong Kong in December looking for them.
"We have become aware of Sri Lankan police taking active steps to locate my clients," he said, adding: "They identified themselves to members of the Sri Lankan community in Hong Kong. They carried photographs and files."
Sri Lankan police spokesman Priyantha Jayakodi said the allegation was "a complete lie".
"We have not done any investigation in Hong Kong or any other country on any refugee case," he told BBC Sinhala.
However Mr Tibbo said the evidence came from Sri Lankans living in Hong Kong who were approached on the street in late December by people who carried official identification.
His clients fed and housed Mr Snowden for two weeks in June 2013 when he fled the US after leaking thousands of documents belonging to the US National Security Agency (NSA).
The former IT contractor subsequently left Hong Kong for Moscow.
The names of the asylum seekers, Kellapatha Supun Thilina and Debagma Kankanalamage Ajith Pushpa Kumara, were revealed last year by Mr Tibbo, ahead of the September premiere of the film Snowden by the director Oliver Stone.
He said that it would have been difficult to keep their identities secret after the film's release.
Mr Tibbo believes the Sri Lankan government began investigating the asylum seekers shortly afterwards.
The lawyer says Sri Lankan officials may have noted the disappearances of the Causeway Bay booksellers and the Chinese billionaire Xiao Jianhua - who some fear may have been forcibly taken from Hong Kong to mainland China.
"With the Hong Kong government not holding Beijing accountable, and the lack of transparency, this amounts to an invitation to other governments in the world," Mr Tibbo said.
"That their security forces, their police officers are welcome to come into Hong Kong and investigate and do similar things," he added.
Two local lawmakers, Charles Mok and James To, have called for an investigation.
"I am very concerned about this case," said Mr To, a member of the pro-democracy Democratic Party.
"Nobody can come and enforce the law in Hong Kong except Hong Kong officials. Nobody can come in breach of Hong Kong law."
The asylum seekers have since moved to "safer" locations and have notified Hong Kong's immigration department.
They also plan to file a police report.
Mr Thilina, who arrived in Hong Kong in 2005, said he was frightened by the news.
"I am nervous and scared. I don't have a normal life now," he said.
His compatriot, Mr Kumara, an army deserter who served as an informal bodyguard to Mr Snowden in 2013, was also worried for his safety.
They are concerned about the prospect of being removed from Hong Kong and forcibly returned to Sri Lanka, where they say they could face violence and torture.
Mr Tibbo represents both men, along with Mr Snowden and Vanessa Rodel, an asylum seeker from the Philippines who also gave refuge to the US whistleblower in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong currently has about 10,000 asylum seekers, mainly from countries in South Asia and Africa.(BBC)

## Title: Tackling haemorrhoids

Tackling haemorrhoids
	

The digestive system of our body is adapted to break down food and absorb nutrients into our body. The food we swallow travels through the tract and at the end of a 30 foot journey, the unabsorbed food remnants are expelled from our body as stools or faeces. The wall of the bowels form sphincters (valves) that serve as gateways to passage of food particles. The anal canal, the lattermost part of the digestive tract has two such valves, namely the external and internal anal sphincters that aid in continence (stool control). In addition, the mucosa and submucosa of the anal canal forms 3 anal cushions that serve as an efficient fluid and gas-proof seal. These cushions are highly vascular structures covered by a thin epithelium. Due to many reasons, these anal cushions may become enlarged, giving rise to the condition known as haemorrhoids or piles. These enlarged, congested cushions often bleed and you will have to seek medical attention immediately.
Haemorrhoids is a Latin term derived from the Greek word haimorrhois (haima-blood, rhoos-flowing). In our community, most people refer to any abnormal lump or skin tag felt at the anus as piles. It is important to know that a lump at the anus or bleeding with defecation does not always mean that you are suffering from haemorrhoids. Lumps may also occur in a more serious conditions such as cancer (colorectal carcinoma), prolapsed rectum (protrusion of the rectum through the anal orifice) andinflammatory bowel disease as well non-threatening isolated skin tags. Consultation of a general surgeon once you experience the symptoms will help timely diagnosis, exclusion of colorectal cancer and apt treatment. 
Symptoms
Uncomplicated haemorrhoids are usually associated with painless bleeding with defecation (passage of stools). Blood appears bright red on toilet paper or may splash on to the lavatory pan if the bleeding is heavy. The second symptom is a lump felt in the anus, following defecation and haemorrhoids are classified into 4 types accordingly. 

First degree - No prolapse felt (lump). Only bleeding 
Second degree - Piles prolapse but reduce spontaneously 
Third degree - Piles prolapse. Reduction has to be done manually 
Fourth degree  Piles permanently prolapsed 
In addition 

  Itching due to leakage of mucus from the exposed mucosa onto the skin. 
	  Discomfort 
	 Pain (when complicated) is seen. 
These symptoms may vary with the individuals diet, physical activity and psychological stress levels. 
What causes haemorrhoids
The current understanding of it reveals that shearing forces exerted on the anus cause mucosal trauma and the downward displacement of these anal cushions distorting the supporting structures lead to a loss of elasticity (the ability of an object to resume its normal shape after being stretched), that causes failure to retract following defecation. The shearing forces are generated as a result of the following. 

  Fibre-deficient diet (Prolongs gut transit time, forming smaller, harder stools that require a tremendous strain to expel) 
	  Presence of hard faecal mass in the rectum, obscuring blood flow, eventually causing congestion in the cushions 
	  Straining to pass stools and sitting on the lavatory for a prolonged period of time (the habit of reading newspapers or gaming on the mobile phone) adding to the congestion 
	  Holding the urge to defecate 
	Weakening of supportive muscular structures with ageing 
	  Low physical exercise causing reduced metabolism, thus delaying digestion 
	 Dehydration 
Haemorrhoids may occur in any age group but are extremely rare in children. It is uncommon in individuals below the age of 30, although women in that age category may develop it during pregnancy or after childbirth.
Although both sexes are affected, theres a slightly higher incidence in men than in women. The occurrence in children is extremely rare. 10 percent of the population experience symptomatic haemorrhoids at some point of their lives. It is found to be more prevalent in urban areas compared to rural and more in those with a higher socio-economic status, that may be a result of dietary deficiency of fibre. They are more common in individuals with raised abdominal pressure (i.e. constipation, pregnancy, obesity). 
This condition has periods of relapse and spontaneous resolution that may cause delayed presentation for medical help. Some are reluctant to seek help as they find this condition mortifying. This is a benign disease condition that is often repressed by the affected, fostering a significant negative impact on their lives, as it causes constant physical and psychological discomfort, such as lack of self-esteem and poor educational/work performance. The pain during defecation makes the individual reluctant to pass stools that further precipitates the condition. Early detection and treatment avoids complications and relieves discomfort. 
Complications
The bleeding should never be underestimated regardless of the volume, as chronic blood loss with haemorrhoids often gives rise to iron deficiency anaemia. 
	  Profuse haemorrhage 
	  strangulation (cut off of blood supply) 
	  thrombosis (blood clot) 
	  ulceration and gangrene (tissue death) 
	 fibrosis 

Diagnosis
The diagnosis of haemorrhoids is made by a clinician based on the symptoms and a digital rectal examination findings. In addition a proctoscopy (the proctoscope is an apparatus that helps view the anal cavity) is performed. The possibility of colorectal cancer should always be excluded with performance of a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. A small percentage of haemorrhoids are associated with colorectal cancer. 
Management
The classification into different degrees helps decide on the management plan. The initial intervention consists of conservative treatments for those with first and second degree haemorrhoids. Conservative measures include adding wholegrain bread and cereals (wheat, oats barley and rye) , fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes softens and increases the bulk of stools allowing easier and less strenuous passage owing to the high dietary fibre content (A daily minimum of 25g fibre for women and 38g for men is recommended) An adequate amount of water (at least 8 glasses per day) complements the high fibre diet. In addition, stool softeners and bulking agents, evacuation of bowels only when nature calls and adaptation of defecating positions help minimize straining. Suppositories and various topical creams may alleviate symptoms. 
If first and second degree haemorrhoids do not improve with conservative measures, the surgeon proceeds with other non-operative interventions such as sclerotherapy injections. For bigger piles, banding is a less common method used. Third and fourth degree piles, second degree piles that do not respond to non-operative measures, complicated external piles or severe bleeding causing anaemia require surgical interventions such as haemorrhoidectomy.  Haemorrhoids are a benign condition resolved with prompt medical care. It is important to seek help as soon as possible, to nip it in the bud and avoid complications. Since prevention is always better than cure, be mindful to incorporate high dietary fibre in meals, drink plenty of water, exercise moderately to increase the basal metabolic rate of the body, avoid prolonged sitting on the toilet and initiate defecation only when you have the urge and avoid straining.

Top Yemen commander killed as rebels hit back
	
Yemen government forces launched an offensive in January to try to recapture the Red Sea coastline.

Yemeni rebels hit back at government forces advancing up the Red Sea coast killing a deputy army commander in a missile strike, a military source said on Wednesday.  Army deputy chief of staff Major General Ahmad Saif Al Yafii was killed by a heat-seeking missile on the outskirts of the coastal town of Mokha, the source told AFP. 
The rebels and their allies had pushed back south and reached the eastern outskirts of Mokha, which the army had overrun on February 10. 
It was a major setback for an offensive launched by government forces in January to try to recapture Yemens 450 kilometre (280 miles) Red Sea coastline, which had previously been almost entirely in rebel hands.

US targets millions in sweeping deportation plan
	
The secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, John Kelly, said a crackdown on illegal immigrants was needed.  

WASHINGTON AFP /Feb22, 2017- The Trump administration issued tough new orders on Tuesday for a sweeping crackdown on illegal immigrants, putting nearly all of the countrys 11 million undocumented foreigners in its crosshairs. 
The orders sent shivers through US immigrant communities, where millions of people who have spent years building families and livelihoods in the country, most of them from Mexico and Central America, were seriously threatened with deportation for the first time in decades. Rights groups labelled the move a witch hunt, warning that mass deportations would damage families with deep roots in the United States and hurt the economy. 

But John Kelly, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) who issued the new orders in two memos, said they were necessary to address a problem that has overwhelmed government resources.

Vehicle registration files removed by a fmr. commissioner: DMT
	
A number of vehicle registration files had been allegedly removed by a former Commissioner Administration at the Department of Motor Traffic (DMT), Commissioner General A.H.K. Jagath Chandrasiri said.
Commissioner Chandrasiri said that the DMT had requested the Transport Ministry Secretary to probe against the Commissioner-Administration in connection with the incident.
The issue was raised by an NGO called Anti Corruption Association. The association had taken the matter up with the President, the Prime Minister and other Authorities and had demanded an investigation on missing number of vehicle registration files.
When asked DMT Commissioner General said the former Commissioner Administration had her transfer, along with five other officials, with effect from January 1.
Five officials were transferred but the lady Commissioner stayed in the office locking herself in her cabin for more than a week forcibly. She had collected many documents during her service period.
I looked at her cabin because there was panic as other employees had tried to talk to her through the glass and intercom, the commissioner said.
Then I saw pile of files stored in a corner of her office room and I thought the files were to be hand over to the department as it was the procedure of handing over when a person is transferred, he said.
She had handed over fourteen files to the departments Chief Clerk including employee transfer files in 2013 and 2014 except vehicle registration files, the Commissioner said.
However, she has taken all her files out of the department premises after office hours using a Police Vehicle (KX-2342) belonging to a senior police officer in the North Western Province. All the activities had been recorded on the Department CCTV video footages. One CCTV camera pointed at her cabin had been disabled by her at the time. She had the access to operate CCTV camera system based on her post in the department. Several Police personnel were there in the department including civil officers.
According to CCTV video footages she had taken the Department files out a number of days using the same Police vehicle.
She has refused to use the vehicle but instead claimed the allowance and used Police vehicles during her service, which was an illegal for a State service employee,
As Commissioner General I informed her to bring back the file that taken with her but no reply had received yet. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Visa makes major IoT play with IBM partnership
	
IBM this week announced the industrys first collaboration that brings the point of sale everywhere Visa is accepted, by allowing businesses to quickly introduce secure payment experiences for any device connected to the Internet of
things (IoT).
The collaboration brings together IBMs Watson IoT platform and cognitive capabilities, with Visas global payments services that are used by more than three billion consumers globally. IBMs Watson IoT Platform allows businesses to connect to billions of connected devices, sensors and systems around the world and then draw actionable insights. Today the platform is used by more than 6,000 IBM clients that are helping customers connect to millions
of devices.
IBM and Visa share a vision and commitment to embed payments and commerce into any device - from a watch, to a ring, an appliance or a car. Under this collaboration, companies can infuse secure payments across their entire product lines using the Visa Token Service, a new security technology that replaces sensitive payment account information found on payment cards with a unique digital identifier, via IBMs Watson IoT platform. As a result, IBM and Visa could support payments and commerce on many of the 20 billion connected devices estimated to be in the global economy by 2020i.
IoT is literally changing the world around us, whether its allowing businesses to achieve unimaginable levels of efficiency or enabling a washing machine to ensure we never run out of detergent. And behind this transformation are companies like Visa and technologies like IBMs Watson IoT platform, said IBM Watson IoT General Manager Harriet Green.
This combination of IBMs industry-leading IoT technologies with Visa payment services signifies the next defining moment in commerce by allowing payments on any connected object, with new levels of simplicity and convenience for everyone.
Examples of commerce-based IoT
Consider the consumers car. Experts estimate there will be 380 million connected cars by 2021ii. As the car ecosystem connects to the Watson IoT Platform, a driver would be alerted when the cars warranty or certification is about to expire or if specific car parts need replacing. With this information, the driver can order parts with the push of a button, or schedule a service appointment at their preferred local garage. The driver could even pay for gas through a direct interaction between the car and the gas pump.
Similarly, with a fitness device, an avid runner with a wireless running chip, could receive a digital alert when its time to replace her running shoes, including a recommendation of the best model, at the best price, from a preferred retailer. Additional relevant and tailored recommendations could be offered, including nutrition and equipment recommendations, based on individual performance, local climates and
shopping preferences.
The Internet of Things is not only driving a more connected world, its changing the way we live, shop and pay, by moving data and the point-of-sale to wherever the consumer wants it to be, said Visa Inc. Executive Vice President Innovation And Strategic Partnerships
Jim McCarthy.
With the power of Watsons cognitive technologies and IBMs leadership in IoT and security, they are the ideal partner to help us deliver secure payments to virtually anywhere and on the enormous scale of the IoT.
How it works
In the future with this collaboration, all of IBMs Watson IoT Platform customers will have access to Visa payment services via the IBM Cloud. As a result, rather than approaching businesses on a one-by-one basis, IBM and Visa will provide all customers with access to these capabilities, so they can begin to build personalized commerce experiences and proactively make recommendations based on consumers unique needs.
As part of this collaboration, the companies will also ensure that all consumer information remains secure by leveraging Visas Token Service, which replaces sensitive account information found on payment cards, such as the 16-digit account number, expiration date and security code, with a unique digital identifier that can be used to process payments without exposing actual account details. The Visa Token Service is accessible through a network of token service providers (TSPs) as part of the Visa Ready partnership programme, which certifies the next generation of third-party payment solutions to ensure they meet Visas security standards and specifications, and will have seamless and secure global acceptance.
Today IBM is working with more than 6,000 clients, around the globe and across industries, to help them truly realize the benefits of IoT. Many of these innovations are on display at IBMs Watson IoT headquarters in Munich where today IBM, customers, partners and influencers are gathering for the first-ever Genius of Things Summit. At Genius of Things, attendees will examine how Watson IoT clients are implementing IoT solutions to drive exceptional outcomes.

## Title: wheezing and obesity in kids

wheezing and obesity in kids
	

Medical literature has revealed a link between wheezing and obesity, where wheezing could very often lead to obesity in young children. This is mainly due to the exercise intolerance evident in young patients with wheezing and due to the use of steroids for the control of the illness, says Consultant Paediatrician at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital, Dr. Deepal Perera. He said steroids were often given as treatment for wheezing in children. Steroids are one of the causes for obesity and could also lead to diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis, bone fractures and cataracts. On the other hand, he stressed that obesity could also lead to various other chronic illnesses such as heart disease, diabetes and various other health complications. Excerpts of the interview: 
QWhat causes wheezing and how does wheezing lead to obesity
Genetics could be ranked as one of the main reasons why children end up with wheezing, later leading to obesity. In addition to genetically inherited causes, certain pills, syrups, inhalers and nebulizers containing steroids taken as medication for wheezing could also have side-effects on childrens health. One of the main side-effects of consuming these medications is the increase in appetite, which in the long run would give rise to obesity in children. Exercise intolerance in children with wheezing is another factor that leads to obesity. One should take note that not exercising is one of the commonest risk factors leading to obesity. 
QWhat are the preventive measures parents can take to address this health issue evident in children
Parents can address this issue by encouraging their children to engage in sports like swimming, which is very helpful in combating wheezing-related health issues. It should be noted that wheezing is only a symptom that leads to the diagnosis of reversible obstruction of airways, also known as asthma. Therefore, it is important that necessary measures are taken to address wheezing at an early stage in order to avoid both asthma and obesity. 
Therefore, it is the parents responsibility to encourage and introduce children to physical activities such as swimming, which is helpful in tackling wheezing and preventing obesity. The majority of children with wheezing improve in health, as a result of engaging in sports. 
My opinion is that parents should also advise their children to use the inhaler before engaging in exercise.
QCould you explain the difference between wheezing and asthma, and in your opinion does asthma also lead to obesity
Yes, both can lead to obesity if steroid drugs are constantly used for treatment, and exercise intolerance is always evident in the patient. Asthma can be defined as a reversible obstruction of airways. The airway obstruction can be reversed by the use of Salbutamol as treatment. It should be noted that asthma is a diagnosis, whereas wheezing is a symptom. Wheezing refers to difficulty in breathing and especially in exhalation; where prolonged exhalations are commonly experienced in many patients. 
QCan obesity lead to wheezing or breathing difficulties in children
Obese people naturally have some difficulty in breathing out. They have a potential to develop wheezing but this is not common. Obese people are prone to developing breathing difficulties such as a blocked nose, snoring and critical Obstructive Sleep Apnea. In the case of Obstructive Sleep Apnea, patients experience breathing problems during the night. Such patients are mainly diagnosed with upper respiratory problems instead of lower respiratory problems. It should be noted that lower respiratory problems occur generally due to wheezing. Snoring is also generally triggered as a result of upper respiratory block in obese people. 
QWhat are the red flag signs parents should watch for with regard to the development of a wheezing tendency or obesity in children
Wheezing patients generally experience a cough in the night, after exercise, after consumption of certain drugs, due to dietary patterns and when they are exposed to dust. However, coughing during the night is one of the major symptoms indicating that the child may be vulnerable to a wheezing tendency or bronchial asthma. 
In the case of obesity, the childs development record should be charted in terms of height and weight. Basically, we chart the Body Mass Index of the child. The childs weight in kilograms will be divided by the childs height in square metres to gain the Body Mass Index. 
There are three colours (purple, green and red) that help determine the childhood development record. If the BMI ranges in the red section, this indicates a low weight, whereas purple indicates overweight, which is bad for health. The childs weight can be charted by both doctors and parents. 

QAs a Paediatrician, what kind of overall advice would you give parents to help their children overcome problems due to wheezing or obesity
It is always better to get the wheezing under control. Most parents are worried about giving their children inhalers to use. However, inhalers are the best, rather than getting accustomed to steroids.
If you take a steroid pill, its contents will mostly mingle with the blood circulation, stomach and liver, and only a small part of its composition will reach the lungs. Besides, a large amount of steroids will have to be taken to control the wheezing, whereas inhalers are required only in limited amounts to control the wheeze. Parents should encourage their children to use inhalers rather than depend on steroid pills to help overcome it effectively. Regular use of inhalers helps prevent wheeze and reduce the risk of obesity in children.
Wheezing and obesity are becoming increasingly common among children. Therefore, parents should be more aware of these health complications and help their children overcome such illnesses from an early stage.

Wimal can't form a new party: Dayasiri
	
National Freedom Front Leader Wimal Weerawansa has no right to form a new party to function independently, SLFP Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said at the weekly SLFP media briefing today.
Mr. Weerawansa yesterday told Parliament that five members belonging to his party would function independently in the Opposition and that they should be recognised as a separate party in Parliament.
He said he had informed the Speaker about this decision in writing earlier and the latter had failed to heed the request.
There are only three main parties in the United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA). All the other parties contested in the UPFA led by the SLFP. Those parties were not considered as separate entities. If Mr. Weerawansa wants to function as an independent party he can be independent in Parliament like Minister Chandrasiri Gajadeera," he said.
Before he form an individual party he should write to the SLFP General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera for permission, the Minister said.(Chaturanga Paradeep)

UPFA General Secretary and Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said today that his party could consider JNP leader Wimal Weerawansa's request to operate as an independent party, if a written request was made to that effect.It was later learnt that the request letter of Mr. Weerawansa was dispatched to the UPFA General Secretary.
"Many of these parties contest from the political parties which have a vote base during elections but later go on their own. It possible to see the real strength of these parties if they contest an election on their own" he said earlier, adding that Mr. Weerawansa should have informed the UPFA about his party's operate as an independent party instead of making a request from the Speaker,(Yohan Perera and Aijth Siriwardana)
