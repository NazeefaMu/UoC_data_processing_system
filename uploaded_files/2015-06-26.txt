Death sentence on staff sergeant proves vibrant judiciary: Army
	
The conviction and death sentence imposed on an Army Staff Sergeant on Thursday clearly indicated that Sri Lanka has an independent and exceptional judicial system, Army Spokesman Jayanath Jayaweera said today.
He told a media conference held at the Information Department that the government would not hesitate to bring to book any armed forces personnel with prima facie evidence against them of having committed acts of crime, violence or corruption.
?It is essential to have a disciplined and highly efficient army dedicated to safeguarding Sri Lanka?s sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence. In such an environment there is no place for miscreants and law breakers,? Brigadier Jayaweera said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Decline in disappearances,unlawful killings in SL: US HR report 2014
	
The 2014 Human Rights Report issued by the US State Department, in its section on Sri Lanka has noted a comparative decrease in involuntary disappearances and unlawful killings in relation to the immediate postwar period but has noted a series of many other human rights violations that occurred due to governance issues stemming from Rajapaksa-family dominance. ?
The report which was released yesterday notes that among the major violations of human rights were ?attacks on, and harassment of, civil society activists, journalists, and persons viewed as sympathizers of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) by individuals allegedly tied to the government; involuntary disappearances, arbitrary arrest and detention, torture, abuse of detainees, rape, and other forms of sexual and gender-based violence committed by police and security forces; and widespread impunity for a broad range of human rights abuses. . .?
Despite the drop in involuntary disappearances and unlawful killings, the report states that media institutions, NGOs and critics of the government were harassed, threatened and attacked by pro-government loyalists which had led to ?widespread fear and self-censorship by journalists? that had contributed to deterioration of democratic activity.
The 2014 HR report has also emphasized that military officials implicated in human rights abuses that allegedly occurred during the conflict are yet to be held accountable for alleged violations of international humanitarian law.
It has also referred to the clashes that occurred in the South last year, noting the activities of the Bodu Bala Sena ? their attacks and assaults on civilians and members of religious minorities. Among the other human rights abuses noted in the report that occurred last year in Sri Lanka include unlawful killings by security forces, infringement of the government on citizens' privacy rights, neglecting the rights of internally displaced persons, maintaining constitutional authority to maintain control of appointments to previously independent public institutions that oversee the judiciary, police and human rights issues as well as the corruption and lack of transparency of the previous government led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.(LP)

Govt  Wants  to Review Ban on Tamil  Diaspora Organizations Listed  as ?Terrorists?
	
By?D.B.S. Jeyaraj
Sri Lanka?s ebullient Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera is currently in the forefront of a move to review, and possibly remove the ban imposed on certain Sri Lankan Tamil Diaspora organizations and individuals ?designated as ?terrorists? under ?provisions of the United Nations Act No. 45 of 1968.
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and 15 other organizations functioning on foreign soil were proscribed as foreign terrorist organizations by Gazette Extraordinary 1856/41 of March 21, 2014. Apart from these 16 entities, a further 424 individuals with suspected LTTE links who were ?living in 19 countries, including Sri Lanka ?were also listed.
The Gazette proclamation ?listing designated persons, groups and entities was done according to ?sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph (4) of the United Nations Regulations No. 1 of 2012 ?that was published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1758/19 of May 15, 2012. The ?designated Competent authority for establishing and maintaining the list with respect to ?natural persons, legal persons, groups and entities was Gotabaya Rajapaksa who was then ?the ?Secretary, Defence and Urban Development ministry.
The order, designating persons and entities in terms of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373, which sets out strategies to combat terrorism and to control terrorist financing ?was signed by Prof. G.L. Peiris who was then the Minister of External Affairs. The UN Security Council Resolution 1373 ?came into being on September 28, 2001 in the wake of the attack on the New York World Trade Centre on September 11, 2001.Press Release
The Sri Lankan External Affairs ministry issued a press release last year announcing the proscription. It stated as follows :?
??An order, designating persons and entities in terms of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373, which sets out strategies to combat terrorism and to control terrorist financing has been signed by Prof. G.L. Peiris, Minister of External Affairs, and will be published in the Government Gazette shortly?.
?This order is based on the recommendation by the Secretary, Ministry of Defence and Urban Development, as the Competent Authority regarding the identification of persons, groups and entities, believed on reasonable grounds to be committing, attempting to commit, facilitating or participating, in the commission of acts of terrorism?.
??The substantial effect of an order under this Regulation is that all funds, assets and economic resources belonging to or owned by the designated persons or entities remain frozen until they are removed from the designated list?.
?Moving, transferring or dealing with frozen assets without the permission of the Competent Authority is prohibited. In terms of the Regulation, any person who fails to comply with an order to freeze assets is liable to heavy penalties?.
It could be seen therefore, that the process of proscribing Diaspora organizations technically falls under the purview of the External or ?Foreign Affairs ministry. This then is the ?locus standi? for Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera to initiate action on this matter now. It is also to be noted that there is provision for periodic review of the ?proscription as part of a due process.
?
	"Mangala Samaraweera is a man described by friend and foe alike as ?a man whose heart is in the right place?. This writer has a lot of ?personal regard for him as a ?Ruhunu Puthra? with an enlightened and progressive outlook on the troubling ethnic question"
	"In March 2015, when speaking on the topic of reviewing the ban on Tamil Diaspora organizations in Parliament, Mangala Samaraweera reportedly stated ??this ?(listing) was done to build up the hysteria about the LTTE regrouping in the run up to the Presidential election"
Mangala Samaraweera
Speaking in Parliament in March 2015, Minister ?Mangala Samaraweera called for a review of the ban on some Diaspora ?organizations and individuals. One month later in April, the Minister announced in Parliament that the review process on 16 organizations and 424 individuals was now in progress. In early June this year, Minister Samaraweera held talks with representatives of the proscribed Global Tamil Forum(GTF) in London. Addressing a press conference in Colombo this week, the Minister stated that he was engaged in efforts to reach out to the Sri Lankan Tamil Diaspora as part of a reconcilliatory process. Mr. Samaraweera emphasised that the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe Govt was firmly backing his efforts.
Mangala Samaraweera is a man described by friend and foe alike as ?a man whose heart is in the right place?. This writer has a lot of ?personal regard for him as a ?Ruhunu Puthra? with an enlightened and progressive outlook on the troubling ethnic question. This energetic Southern politician from Matara has demonstrated on many occasions that he was indeed ?a true friend of the minority communities of Sri Lanka. He has not hesitated to speak out boldly against ?ethnic oppression.
However, he often falls into trouble in his eagerness and enthusiasm to ?do the right thing?. Spurred by his desire to rectify wrongs or take remedial action quickly, Mangala ?often rushes into areas where other politicians fear to tread. His commendable current project of reaching out to the Diaspora also seems to be an area where the son of Mahanama Samaraweera would be better-off if he ?treads with more ?caution.?
?
	"Advocating secessionism without engaging in violence regarded as terrorism does ?not make the advocates concerned terrorist.?"
Two Suggestions
This writer would like to offer two suggestions to the Minister and his government.?
Firstly ? reach out to the Tamils living in the Island before seeking out ?those living abroad. Those in Sri Lanka ?are the ones who have suffered most and need support. Prioritize them before the Diaspora.
Secondly ? ?Study the politics of the Tamil Diaspora well before plunging in. The Tamil Diaspora issue is a complicated one with deep ramifications. Do not rely entirely ?on input provided by ?Tamil politicians ?or NGO personnel in Sri Lanka or Diaspora representatives abroad on this issue. Proceed with the light of knowledge rather than the heat of passion.
Why I say this is because some of Samaraweera?s pronouncements make me wonder whether he is fully appraised of the facts concerning proscription of Diaspora organizations. For instance in March 2015, when speaking on the topic of reviewing the ban on Tamil Diaspora organizations in Parliament, Mangala Samaraweera reportedly stated ??this ?(listing) was done to build up the hysteria about the LTTE regrouping in the run up to the Presidential election?. Mangala was totally wrong in this assertion. As a journalist, ?who has closely followed and written about the proscription of Tamil Diaspora entities and individuals in March 2014, I would not subscribe to Samaraweera?s view that the proscription was ?done to build up the hysteria about the LTTE regrouping in the run up to the Presidential election?. As far as I am aware, the final gazetting in March 2014 was the culmination of a very long process that had been delayed to a great extent ?by bureaucratic procrastination.
?
	"Currently the Government of Maithripala Sirisena seems to have adopted a different approach to that of its predecessor. It has taken cognizance of distinct differences among the proscribed entities"
UN Security Council Resolutions
This basis for the listing of foreign terrorist organizations are ?the United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1373 and 1267. The proscription process relating to ?Diaspora organizations and individuals allegedly providing material support to the LTTE, and by extension ?terrorism? commenced in 2008.?
It was started by the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka with assistance provided by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Thereafter the process continued with the Ministry of External Affairs, the Attorney General?s Dept and the Legal Draftsman?s Dept joining the FIU effort at different stages. The ministry of defence entered the process in 2011.
There also began a series of protracted gazette notifications connected to the proscription process. The Gazette notification of UN Security Council ?resolution 1373 was done by Extra Ordinary Gazette of May 15, 2012. Likewise Gazette notification of UN SC resolution ?1267 ?was done by Extra Ordinary Gazette ?of May 31, 2012. Then followed a series of ?related gazette notifications ?on June 11, 2013, Aug ?16, 2013, Jan ? 2, 2014, Jan ? 23, 2014 and Feb ? 13, 2014. The ?grand finale? was gazetted on March 21, 2014.
It could be seen therefore, that the ?proscription process was a long drawn-out exercise and not something engineered at short notice to build up hysteria in the run up to the 2015 ?Presidential elections as alleged by Mangala.
?The inordinate delay in the process which began in 2008 and ended only in 2014, is attributed to customary bureaucratic lethargy. It appears that Minister Samaraweera has either ?misinformed himself or been deliberately misinformed on this aspect.?
It would be relevant at this juncture to ?briefly delve into the background of a few ?of the 16 organizations and 424 individuals designated by gazette proclamation.Listed Individuals
The ?424 listed individuals; comprising men and women are ?too numerous to be mentioned specifically. These persons of whom around 30 are women are purportedly living in countries such as Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, India, Malaysia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, UK and the USA. Among those listed as designated individuals are, the self-styled Prime Minister of the Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam (TGTE) Visvanathan Ruthirakumaran, Global Tamil Forum (GTF) President Rev. Fr. Seemanpillai Joseph Emmanuel, LTTE International Secretariat leader Perinbanayagam Sivaparan alias ?Nediyavan? and LTTE Headquarters leader Segarampillai Vinayagamoorthy alias ? ? ??Vinayagam?.
Apart from these four persons, ?several present and former ?Parliament members? of the Transnational Govt were also ?listed. Among them is ?the ?former Tamil National Alliance MP from Batticaloa, ?Senathirajah Jeyanandamoorthy, now resident in Britain. Also designated were ?many key activists of the LTTE, including current and former ?country chiefs? in many European countries. Two prominent LTTE personalities ?so designated ?are KP Reggie former head of the Tamil Rehabilitation Organization (TRO) in Sri Lanka and ?Root Ravi?who was in charge of the LTTE economic division TEEDOR ?in Jaffna and the Wanni. Root Ravi ?in London is ?regarded as the controlling force behind the British Tamil forum (BTF) while KP Reggie shuttles between UK and Norway supervising various income generating ?assets? procured through ?TRO finances.
Several persons against whom INTERPOL red notices were earlier issued at the behest of Sri Lakan authorities were ?also listed by the gazette declaration. This includes Ponniah Aanandarajan alias Aiyah who is suspected of allegedly retaining vast amounts of ?LTTE money intended for the purchase of arms. ?Aiyah?, ?a US citizen is said to be residing in a Mid-Western State in the USA.Banned Entities
the sixteen ?banned entities listed are as follows:-
1. liberation tigers of tamil eelam a.k.a ltte a.k.a tamil tigers.
?2. tamil rehabilitation organization a.k.a tro.
?3. tamil coordinating committee a.k.a tcc
?4. british tamil forum a.k.a btf
?5. world tamil movement a.k.a wtm
?6. canadian tamil congress a.k.a ctc
?7. australian tamil congress a.k.a atc
?8. global tamil forum a.k.a gtf
?9. national council of canadian tamils a.k.a ncct a.k.a makkal avai
?10. tamil national council a.k.a tnc
?11. tamil youth organization a.k.a tyo
?12. world tamil coordinating committee a.k.a wtcc.
?13. transnational government of tamil eelam a.k.a tgte
?14. tamil eelam peoples assembly a.k.a tepa
?15. world tamil relief fund a.k.a wtrf
?16. headquarters group a.k.a head quarters group
While some of these ?outlawed organizations were reportedly functioning in a single country alone, there were others with branches in different countries. These countries include the USA, Canada, ?Britain, Norway, Italy, Switzerland, France and Australia.
Among the notable organizations proscribed were the Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam (TGTE) headed by Visuvanathan Ruthirakumaran, Global Tamil Forum headed by Catholic Priest Fr. SJ Emmanuel, the LTTE group and affiliated outfits led by Perinbanayagam Sivaparan alias Nediyavan and the tiger group (Headquarters group) led by Sekarampillai Vinayagamoorthy alias Vinayagam.
Sri Lankan security circles believed at the time of proscription that the listed entities could be classified into four broad groupings ?that are either controlled or influenced greatly by four persons namely Ruthirakumaran, ?Fr. Emmanuel, Nediyavan and Vinayakam. Although the Sri Lankan Govt ?opted to lump all four groups together as ?terrorist entities? there were crucial differences between the organizations led by Ruthirakumaran and Fr. Emmanuel on the one hand, and the outfits led by Nediayavan and Vinayakam on the other. There are major differences among the four key personalities and also among the organizations they lead.
Both the Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam (TGTE) led by Ruthirakumaran and the Global Tamil Forum (GTF) led by Rev. Fr. SJ Emmanuel ? despite the alleged relationship to the LTTE ? function openly in various parts of the world. The TGTE and GTF activities are generally visible and transparent and even subscribe to a modicum of accountability in certain respects. The LTTE factions under Nediyavan and Vinayagam are basically shady outfits often working clandestinely beneath the facade of fronts.Visuvanathan Ruthirakumaran (Rudra)
Visuvanathan Ruthirakumaran, the self-styled Prime Minister of the Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam is a lawyer based in New York. He is the son of former Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) Mayor of Jaffna Rasah Visuvanathan. The TGTE Premier was born in Jaffna on July 6, 1957 and an old boy of Jaffna Central College. Ruthirakumaran entered the Sri Lanka Law college and passed out as an attorney-at-law. He later obtained a masters degree in Law from a Texas university. Ruthirakumaran was also at the Harvard University for doctoral studies.
Ruthirakumaran generally referred to as ?Rudra?, served earlier as the International legal adviser to the LTTE. He participated in the Oslo facilitated talks between the Sri Lankan Govt and LTTE as a resource person for the Tiger delegation. As a result of this LTTE ?connection? Rudra is viewed through a terrorist prism and is persona non grata in European Union countries and Canada. It is indeed amusingly ironic to perceive a ?Transnational? premier being unable to cross transnational borders. After the LTTE was militarily defeated in May 2009, sections of the Global Tamil Diaspora got together and formed what was described as a transnational government. The TGTE held public conventions in cities in North America ?and Europe. It has an ?administrative structure consisting of an elected 135 member assembly, Speaker, deputy speaker, Prime Minister, three Deputy Premiers, seven Cabinet Ministers and ten Deputy Ministers. A second Chamber of representatives was also formed. Besides issuing statements and press releases, the TGTE has done virtually nothing substantial for the cause.
However, the TGTE has been under heavy pressure from the Nediyavan-controlled faction. Subsequently there was a major split in the TGTE and a faction loyal to Nediyavan revolted and formed a separate body. The first election of the TGTE aroused considerable interest within the Diaspora with several candidates contesting and even spending large sums of money for electioneering. When the second TGTE election was held, there was little excitement. Most representatives were elected without any contest. Rudra became TGTE Prime Minister again.Rev. Dr. S.J. Emmanuel
The Global Tamil Forum (GTF) is an umbrella network of which the President is Rev. Dr. Seemanpillai ?Joseph Emmanuel (Fr. SJ Emmanuel). Born in 1934, Fr. Emmanuel hails from Temple road in Jaffna. He did not enter priesthood in the early years of his life. He first obtained a BSc Degree in Physical science in 1958 and worked as a teacher and journalist. He became a Catholic clergyman in the sixties of the previous century. Fr.Emmanuel obtained post-graduate degrees in Philosophy and Theology from the Pontifical Urbaniana University in Rome.
Fr. Emmanuel was regarded as being of Bishop material for the Catholic Dioceses of Jaffna or Mannar, but was not chosen on both occasions. Rt. Rev. Thomas Soundaranayagam and Rt. Rev. Rayappu Joseph were ordained as Bishops of Jaffna and Mannar respectively on two different occasions. Fr. Emmanuel served as Vicar General of the Diocese of Jaffna and Rector of St. Francis Xavier Major Seminary in Jaffna. He has also been the adviser to the Asian Bishops Conference for 8 years and was the founder Director of the ?Centre for Better Society? in Jaffna.
Fr. SJ Emmanuel left Sri Lanka after the Army re-captured Jaffna in 1995-96. After spending some time in London, Fr. Emmanuel relocated to Germany in 1996. He ?travelled about widely in the West interacting with several Tamil organizations. He set-up the Global Tamil Forum in 2009 after the fall of the LTTE. The GTF ?comprised fourteen different organizations at the time it was formed. Today it has shrunk to five. Originally the live-wire of the GTF was the British Tamil Forum (BTF). Thanks to the finances of the BTF, the GTF was able to set-up a secretariat in London. Later a split occurred ?between the GTF and BTF after which the BTF functions separately. ?This has led to a drying up of funds for the GTF .Global Tamil Forum (GTF)
Due mainly to the leadership and direction provided by Fr. Emmanuel, the GTF achieved a great deal of recognition and influence among many Western nations. The GTF ? has engaged in dialogue with government ministers, legislators, high level administrators and media personnel of several Western nations. The GTF claimed that it was trying to help exert international pressure on the Colombo government to evolve an acceptable political solution, while cooperating with international efforts to hold the Rajapaksa regime accountable for alleged war crimes in Sri Lanka.
Fr. Emmanuel and the accredited GTF spokesperson Suren Surendiran met with Robert O?Blake in Washington when he was US Asst Secy of State for South Asia and had photos published in the media. The GTF maintains a very cordial relationship with the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) in Sri Lanka and has been associated together in discussions with South African leaders and representatives. Both the TNA and GTF have been engaged in lobbying at the UN in Geneva. The GTA met British Prime Minister David Cameron six times prior to his trip to Sri Lanka last year for the CHOGM summit. The GTA was largely instrumental in making Cameron adopt a hostile stance towards Colombo.
At one point of time, the GTF credibility was so high that even India softened its stance towards the organization. Fr. Emmanuel was granted a multiple entry visa to India. Emmanuel went to India and held a series of meetings there. Some of these meetings in Tamil Nadu with pro-LTTE elements aroused the suspicion and wrath of Indian authorities. When Emmanuel went to India the second time he was not permitted to enter Tamil Nadu via the Meenambakkam airport in Chennai. He was compelled to turn back and has not been to India since then. Apparently New Delhi perceives ?the GTF as a Tiger cloaked in a cowhide.?Nediyavan? ?Network
The third, and arguably the most important of the four key personalities regarded as formidable foes by the Sri Lankan defence establishment is Nediyavan or Nediyon. His network is somewhat different to the TGTE and GTF in the sense that it primarily consists of one-time LTTE branches and front organizations. With the LTTE being proscribed as a foreign terrorist organization in most Western nations, many of the identified Tiger branches became dormant or transformed themselves into new entities. New fronts were also established.
In a bid to counter the country ?based chapters of Ruthirakumaran?s TGTE, the Nediyavan group also established a network of ?elected? organizations in different countries among the Tamil Diaspora. These organizations were called either ?Makkal Peravai? or ?Thesiyap Peravai? (peoples or National Assemblies/councils) in each country. While these functionaries try to project themselves as democratic political activists, at one level many of them at other levels are involved in shady activity. This is because these outfits are fundamentally LTTE branches pretending to be legitimate political formations.
Thus the Nediyavan network despite its pretensions to the contrary is not transparent or accountable when compared to the TGTE or GTF. It?s democratic credentials leave much to be desired. Many of Nediyavan?s followers are not committed to non ? violence. Moreover, the Nediyavan network is shrouded in ambiguity with many activists having shady, controversial pasts. A few of the key office-bearers in different countries are members or ex-members of the LTTE and have had arms training as well as battlefield experience.Perinbanayagam Sivaparan (Nediyavan)
39-year-old Perinpanayagam Sivaparan is from Sangarathai, Vaddukkoddai in Valigamam West, Jaffna. He bears the nom de guerre ?Nediyavan? meaning tall man in Tamil, and had joined the LTTE in 1994 when he was 18. He was sent to Russia for higher education by the LTTE and studied political science but apparently Sivaparan did not complete his degree in Moscow.
Nediyavan functioned in the LTTE?s political wing and accompanied ?former LTTE political commissar Suppiah Paramu Thamilselvan ?for some rounds of peace talks during 2002 -2003. He was later transferred to the overseas LTTE administration section under Veeragathy Manivannan alias Castro. Nediyavan was in charge of Castro?s public relations unit and inter-acted with several overseas functionaries visiting the Wanni during the peace process.
It was then that Sivaparan alias Nediyavan met his future wife Sivagowri Shanthamohan. She was a Norwegian citizen. Her father?s brother was Gnanendramohan alias Ranjan Lala. Gnanendramohan was one of the pioneering members of the LTTE and a trusted confidante of Prabhakaran. Ranjan Lala was shot in Jaffna by the Army when riding a motorcycle. Sivaparan and Sivagowri fell in Love. Prabhakaran who had been very fond of Ranjan Lala supported the union.
Both married and Sivaparan went to Norway in 2006. The LTTE had been sending a number of operatives abroad over the years. These cadres belonged to different departments of the LTTE and began functioning as Tiger operatives in these new countries. Most of these cadres were from the political and intelligence wings.
Nediyavan took up residence in Norway. The matrimonial alliance with Sivagowri had strengthened Nediyavan?s clout within the LTTE. Castro used him to communicate with overseas operatives. Contact between the Wanni and Tigers abroad was under strain as the war escalated. So Castro appointed an international representative on his behalf. This person was to be in overall charge of the LTTE overseas branches. This was none other than Nediyavan.Segarampillai Vinayagamoorthy
Even after the military debacle suffered by the LTTE in May 2009, Nediyavan continued to be ?in charge of ?LTTE overseas branch administration. He re-asserted his ?sole authority over the overseas LTTE structures after Selvarasah Pathmanathan alias ?KP? was captured in Malaysia and brought to Sri Lanka. But soon there was a new contender. This was Segarampillai Vinayagamoorthy alias Vinayagam, a senior member of the LTTE?s intelligence division. Sri Lankan officials regard him as the fourth formidable foe in the Global Tamil Diaspora.
50-year-old Vinayagam was born on November 10, 1964. His family hails from Idaikkurichchi in the Varani area of the Thenmaratchy region. The family however lived for some years in Chavakachcheri. Vinayagamoorthy joined the LTTE formally in 1985 at the age of 20. He had earlier been a LTTE ?helper?, as a schoolboy. He was absorbed into the LTTE intelligence wing known as Tiger Organization Security Intelligence Service (TOSIS) headed by Pottu Amman. It was later renamed as ?Thesiya Pulanaaivu Pirivu? (National Intelligence division).?
After the Oslo-facilitated ceasefire in 2002, the LTTE intelligence division created a special unit to oversee matters concerning operatives working outside the Wanni in various parts of Sri Lanka as well as those functioning abroad, outside Sri Lanka. The special intelligence unit was called ?External-Internal Intelligence Affairs?. Vinayagam was made the head of this special unit in 2002. He moved to India some months before the LTTE defeat of May 2009. From there he went to Europe in October/November 2009. He sought political asylum in Paris.?
Once in Europe, Vinayagam wove the various Tiger intelligence operatives abroad into a closely knit unit and remained in sole charge of that. For a brief period of time, there was a working relationship between Nediyavan and Vinayagam with both entering into a strategic partnership. This however did not last long and soon both were at loggerheads with each other. Nediyavan was unwilling to relinquish his power while Vinayagam wanted to acquire power. At the heart of this power struggle was money.Conflicting Statements
Both factions claim to be the ?real? LTTE and issued conflicting statements in Tamil on important occasions. The Nediyavan group statements are released by the LTTE office calling itself the ?Anaithulaga Seyalagam? (International Secretariat/office). The Vinayagam faction issues statements through its office known as ?Thalaimai Seyalagam? (chief secretariat/headquarters). ?There has been violence between both factions. Physical assaults and even an assassination have occurred.
Meanwhile, Sri Lankan authorities requested Norway to hand over Nediyavan to them. Oslo did not oblige but Norwegian officials interviewed Nediyavan and warned him that he should not engage in, or promote violence while living on Norwegian soil. Thereafter Nediyavan relocated to a place about 150 miles away from Oslo. He maintains a low-profile and is generally inaccessible. However, it is believed that he continues to communicate verbally with key deputies through trusted couriers.
?Vinayagam, as resident in Paris too has adopted a low-profile in recent times. One reason for Vinayagam?s perceived inactivity is the INTERPOL notice issued on him by Sri Lanka. Another more important reason was the assassination of the LTTE chief in Paris Nadarajah Matheenthiran alias Parithy a.k. a. Regan. The Vinayagam- faction was suspected because Parithy belonged to the Nediyavan group. Vinayagam himself was detained, interrogated and subsequently released. After this Vinayagam has become relatively quiet.Foreign Terrorist Entities
The Sri Lankan Government ?in March 2014 ?listed both the GTF and TGTE as foreign terrorist entities along with the Nediyavan and Vinayagam groups of the LTTE. Lumping all four together came in for criticism at that time. Both the TGTE and GTF may have been ?pro-LTTE and separatist - though the GTF (reminiscent of LTTE) says it is ready for a federal arrangement - ?but it was a moot point as to whether those leanings by themselves were sufficient to be construed as terrorist or committing terrorism. It was pointed out that Sri Lankan authorities would have to furnish credible evidence if they wanted ?host nations such as the USA, Britain, Australia or Canada to take anti-terrorist action against the TGTE, GTF and some other country based community organizations.
Adopting a stance that any organization acknowledging separatism or does not reject separatism in Sri Lanka, is supporting terrorist ideology did ?not appear to be ?a valid argument. There are anti-secessionism and anti-terrorism laws in Sri Lanka. The sixth Amendment to the Constitution is anti-secessionist while the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) is anti-terrorist. A secessionist can be a terrorist only if he or she engages in acts described as terrorist in pursuance of separatism. The LTTE was for both, a separate State and an armed struggle. What was an armed struggle to the LTTE was terrorism to the Sri Lankan State. ?One man?s terrorist is another man?s freedom fighter? goes the well-known saying. Advocating secessionism without engaging in violence regarded as terrorism does ?not make the advocates concerned terrorist. This key point was lost sight of by the Government of Mahinda Rajapaksa when it banned 16 diverse organizations together under the ?terrorist? label.
Currently the Government of Maithripala Sirisena seems to have adopted a different approach to that of its predecessor. It has taken cognizance of distinct differences among the proscribed entities. Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera has personally interacted with representatives of the listed Global Tamil Forum and key functionaries like Fr. Emmanuel and Surendran. ?The GTF is also making appropriate ?noises? conducive to ?a de-listing by Colombo. The stage seems set ?for the ?GTF and its functionaries ?to ?be taken-off the list in the near future. Rudra?s TGTE seems to be shunned due to its overt identification with the LTTE and its open espousal of Tamil Eelam.De-proscription Moves
This anticipated development has resulted in a backlash from other Tamil Diaspora organizations. The GTF has come in for huge criticism as selling out. It remains to be seen whether the GTF will continue to remain in the ?kitchen as the heat increases. On the other hand, the ?De-proscription moves? spearheaded by Mangala Samaraweera have provided further ammunition to the ?Bring back Mahinda? elements crying out over the alleged threat to national security. All these matters require further analysis in a future article.?D.B.S.Jeyaraj can be reached at dbsjeyaraj@yahoo.com

Why didn't COPE ask me ? - Ranil
	
		 		 
		 
			
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday that despite his request that he be summoned to give evidence before the Parliamentary Committee On Public Enterprises (COPE) regarding the Central Bank Bond Issue, he had not been given an opportunity to present himself before the committee.
He said so while addressing the seventh annual conference of the National Association of Scholars at the Central Bank Auditorium in Rajagiriya. He said that, as subject minister, being deprived of such an opportunity raised serious doubts regarding the impartiality of the committee.
There was no doubt that the committee had the absolute right to decide whether or not to call for his evidence. But their action has raised doubts about whether the committee was conducting an impartial inquiry, he said.
He said his government was dedicated to eradicating Bribery and Corruption from government machinery and from public life. How could one expect a parliament that had shielded corruption up to now to take action to eradicate it? he asked.
He said the issuance of bonds by the Central Bank had hitherto been done privately, and, now, when there was transparency in the activities of the Central Bank, it was strange that the opposition MPs who had earlier been silent regarding such activities were raising a hue and cry.
Changing the procedure and issuing bonds after calling for tenders from the public, under the direction of an approved tender board was started only by this government, he said.
When questions were raised about this matter by the opposition, the government had set up of a committee to probe the matter and also made provision for COPE to conduct investigations, he said.
Members of parliament who for the past ten years had never accepted our proposals to investigate allegations of corruption and take steps to curb corruption, and who were silent when these matters were raised in Parliament are now concerned about corruption. It is very amusing, he said.

World Bank approves $50mn for ECD in Sri Lanka
	
		 		 
		 
			
The World Bank Board has approved a US $50 million credit to improve the quality and increase equitable access to early childhood development (ECD) services in Sri Lanka.?
?Early investment in human capital development is particularly effective at increasing the ability of disadvantaged children to access learning opportunities. It will also contribute to improve learning outcomes and support Sri Lanka to become more competitive in the global economy in the long run,? a World Bank statement said.?
Sri Lanka has recently established the State Ministry of Child Affairs to specifically promote the development and wellbeing of children in the 0-5 age group. The country has also developed a draft National Plan for Early Childhood Care and Development (2015-2020), to guide interventions in the ECD sector, which will be supported with this credit line. Early childhood is considered to be the period from conception to 5 years of age. Monitoring and managing the milestones for the 0-2 year olds are well-established in Sri Lanka, with the health sector playing a lead role in ensuring the holistic development of these children.?
?Center-based ECD programs for children in the 3-5 age range are less developed. Sri Lanka has around 17,020 ECD centers staffed by 29,340 teachers.?
Around 84 percent of these centers are under non-state management,? the statement noted.?
?Sri Lanka needs to invest early, invest smartly and invest in all its people regardless of their socio-economic status if it is to meet its growth targets, end absolute poverty, and achieve shared prosperity? ?World Bank Country Director for Sri Lanka and the Maldives Francoise Clottes said.
?Investing in Human Capital is crucial for the country to become competitive in the global economy, and this project aims at strengthening the foundation for Early Childhood Development in Sri Lanka?.
This five year project aims to enroll an additional 150,000 children in ECD centers, while enhancing an additional 2500 such centers to meet national quality standards. By the end of the project, 5000 ECD centers would have conducted annual child development assessments in order to validate the overarching project objective of improving quality of and enhancing equitable access to ECD.
The credit for this project is being provided by the International Development Association (IDA) ? the World Bank?s concessionary lending arm ?with a maturity of 25 years, including a 5 year grace period. The central government agency with primary responsibility for overseeing ECD service delivery is the Children?s Secretariat (CS), housed within the State Ministry of Child Affairs (SMCA).
