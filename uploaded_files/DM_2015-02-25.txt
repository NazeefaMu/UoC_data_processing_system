Indian coast guard to release 19 SL fishermen
	
	The Coast Guard will release 19 Sri Lankan fishermen who were apprehended on charges of trespassing into Indian waters on Tuesday morning.
	Coast Guard ship Vaibhav spotted four fishing boats with Sri Lankan flag about 52 nautical miles off the Kanyakumari coast. The boats and 19 fishermen on them were apprehended.
	The boats and their crew were being brought to Tuticorin. Coast Guard sources had initially said the fishermen would be handed over to the Coast Security Group of the Tamil Nadu police.
	The ICGS Vaibhav and the apprehended boats were supposed to reach Tuticorin coast later in the night. But it was learnt at around 10pm that the ship had received further orders from the Coast Guard High Command in New Delhi.
	"The ship received orders from New Delhi to release the apprehended fishermen with a warning. Hence they are being taken to the International Maritime Boundary Line from where they will be set free," said a Coast Guard official in Tuticorin.
	It is believed that Sri Lankan fishermen were let go as the bilateral relation between the two countries is improving post the regime change in the island nation. Recently, Sri Lanka released 81 Indian fishing boats. India released six Sri Lankan fishermen and their 17 boats on February 13 as a goodwill gesture. (Times of India)

Be in the crowd, not on the stage!
	
	
	Leaders of four constituent political parties of the former ruling coalition held a meeting at Nugegoda recently to push the demand that the alliance headed by the Blues nominate the deposed Big Boss as their Prime Ministerial candidate at the general elections round the corner.
The alliance members of the Western council (except four or five of them) including their Chief decided well ahead of the event to attend this rally.
On hearing about this decision, the national organizer of the Blue party called the Western Council Chief, Is it true that you people are planning to attend the Nugegoda rally he asked.
Yes. We are planning to attend the rally, replied the Provincial Chief. On one hand, it is our duty to attend this rally. On the other hand, it is the belief of our members that the former Big Boss should lead the alliance from the front at the coming elections if we are to emerge victorious.
The national organizer said: True, that the rally is being organized by four constituents of our alliance. You may attend the rally if you are really keen. But dont appear on the stage. If you do appear, you may have to face the consequences.
We are not going to change our decision to attend the rally, replied the Provincial Chief. However, we will comply with your request not to appear on the stage.

Fuel price reduction affects private bus transport:  LPBOA
	
Lanka Private Bus Owners Association (LPBOA) President Gamunu Wijeratna today said a huge loss had incurred in the private transport industry due to the recent fuel price reduction.
Mr. Wijeratna said after the minimum bus fare was reduced to Rs. 8, the balance was returned to the passengers whereas the Rs. 1 was not returned when the minimum fare was at Rs. 9. 
The truth is conductors wont give the balance to the passengers and they do not return that to the bus operators. Instead of that, now the balance is returned to the passengers and bus conductors and drivers reduce this from the daily collection. As a result it is a burden for the bus owners to continue the industry, Mr. Wijerathne said.
By reducing the fuel price, mainly Petrol prices; most of the people travel in their own motor cars and motorcycles. That reduces the daily income from the buses, he further said.(Chaturanga Pradeep)

He is shown the door at long last
	
	
	This one who was taking an active hand in security matters by virtue of the office he held was a close confidant of the deposed Big Boss.
The man who was down-and-out once upon a time is now a billionaire owning a multitude of assets including buses, fuel filling stations and a fleet of tipper trucks.
There was a time  not in the distant past- when this security bigwig was giving orders to Police over the head of the Police Chief. They say that his stupid actions brought the deposed Big Boss to disrepute on a number of occasions.
The man who caused immense damage to the political career of the deposed Big Boss continues to hang around him in the hope of a hay day again.
Quite recently, the man had accompanied his Master to a Pinkama held at the Medamulana Mahagedara. The elder sibling presiding over the Diyawanna House who had organised the Pinkama had flown into a fury on seeing the security fellow in the company of the deposed Big Boss.
The elder sibling was so livid he forgot the sanctity of the occasion and gave the man a dressing down, which was more telling than a physical blow. Get out, he shouted at the man. Never step into these premises again. And the man meekly beat a hasty retreat.
This chap should have been given this treatment long ago. Isnt it too late now a visitor told another in a whisper.

He wanted a post for action and got one for napping
	
	
	The Blue top brass initially held out the powerful secretarial office to the radical Doctor. Later the enthusiastic doctor was highly disappointed to find himself placed in a position nominally close to the Chair, but where he is to have more napping than working.
The inquisitive ones soon discovered the reason behind the Blue Chiefs sudden second thought. The Madam directing the play from behind the scenes had expressed grave misgivings about investing the doctor with secretarial powers.
Meanwhile, a Blue stalwart occupying the main chair in the opposition and a usually reticent party senior from Ratnapura also had added muscle to the Madams objection. Finally the new Blue Chief had decided to re-appoint to the secretarial office the one who once replaced him when the party was in turmoil several weeks ago.

	Ongoing investigations into the drug mafia have taken a new twist, they say.
There is widespread public discontent and disappointment that grilling of Dumi by the sleuths for hours on end appears to have produced no tangible result. What has really happened is that the evidence that sleuths have unearthed have taken them in another direction.
The drug ring Dumi figures in, has helped certain bigwigs of the former regime to launder their filthy lucre!
Police have thrown the dragnet to catch the big fish involved in money laundering and their being hauled before Courts is just a matter of course, they say. Investigations are to continue until the Police are able to come out with iron-clad proof against the bigwigs involved.

	The General has finally found out the person who provided a hideout to Kete who went missing in the wake of the new regime taking office.
Ketes patron, they say, is a holder of a Ministerial portfolio who entered the Diyawanna House from the Generals political party.
This patron had incurred the displeasure of the General when he had submitted bills running into millions of rupees in connection with numerous religious observances and rituals like coconut smashing at temples and Devalayas held across the country to invoke the powers of gods and demigods to obtain the latters release from prison. So he had provided a safe house to Kete just to spite his erstwhile friend, they say.

Kumar Gunaratnam will not be surrendered: FSP
	
Frontline Socialist Party (FSP) Politbureau Member Pubudu Jagoda today said Kumar Gunaratnam would not be surrendered to the Immigration and Emigration Department despite its calling for his surrender.
Mr. Jagoda said Mr. Gunaratnam would not be surrendered to the Immigration and Emigration Department since it was a political matter and added they would resolve it with the ministry concerned.
He said they had submitted an application to the Immigration and Emigration Department and the ministry requesting Sri Lankan citizenship for Mr. Gunaratnam but there had been no positive response so far.
When contacted, the Immigration and Emigration Controller General M.N. Ranasinghe said a removal order would be issued against Mr. Gunaratnam to expel him from the country after he was produced in the Immigration and Emigration Department.
Meanwhile, Mr. Gunaratnam issuing a statement said the government had launched a rapid campaign to deport him without making any attempt to expedite the delaying 100-day programme of the government. 
The government has not been able to take any action against economic criminals, drug dealers and fraudsters as it promised. The discussion about abolishing of the executive presidency has faded away and come to a level of amending it. Even though it was not practical without changing the current New Liberal Economic and Political system, people were expecting the government to do it as promised, he said.
Mr. Gunaratnam said he and some other people had to leave the country because of threats of engaging in politics and that it did not happen on their own accord, and added that there had been such an atmosphere at that time.
I would have been on the disappearance list if it had not been for the pressure exerted on the government by the national and international forces when I was abducted and threatened that I would be killed on April 7, 2012, he added. (Ajith Siriwardana and Darshana Sanjeewa)

National government a gimmick: UPFA allies
	
United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) Parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara today criticized the National Unity Government Concept and said it was a political gimmick by the United National Party (UNP) to make the UPFA powerless. 
Flanked by Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) Leader Dinesh Gunawardena and Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) Leader Udaya Gammanpila, Mr. Nanayakakara told a news conference in Colombo that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe aspires to continue functioning in his post for a longer period by introducing such a concept.
In the guise of a people-friendly government, the UNP wants to retain power because the present Cabinet was not appointed by the peoples franchise. The UNP only wants to make the main opposition SLFP helpless, he said.
 
Mr. Nanayakkara said a UNP strategist Shiral Lakthilake had delivered a speech at a workshop held for Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) MPs and this was absurd. He said the current political dominion had overpowered the rule of law.
Meanwhile, commenting on their move to field former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as UPFA prime ministerial candidate, MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena said they were not attempting to create a rift within the SLFP.
Though the SLFP is the main constituent of the UPFA, we must work together. We hope whatever the issues the SLFP may have will be resolved soon. We are simply attempting to lay the groundwork for the victory of the UPFA, he said.
Provincial Councillor Udaya Gammanpila said the new government was paving the way for the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) to become the main opposition as a goodwill gesture by making the UPFA helpless.(Lahiru Pothmulla)Pix by Kushan Pathiraja

	The highly respected Thera who spearheaded the campaign for the abolition of the Executive Presidency which later turned into a mass movement for a regime change is not a happy person these days, they say.
The Theras dream of a compassionate administration came true. However, he feels that the government machinery does not move fast enough to bring to book, drug and ethanol kingpins and other corrupt elements that plundered public assets amounting to billions of rupees.
The Theras temple located in a city suburb once a hive of political and civil society activity, is now comparatively a quiet place, they say.
Reacting to a comment made by a lay friend about the emptiness of the temple premises these days, the Thera had remarked: Some of my close friends who kept me company are too busy with the responsibilities of their new office.
Meanwhile, some other one-time close associates no longer visit me, because they are unhappy that they did not get the high office they aspired to under the present administration.

	Upul Tharangas proven ability to bat anywhere in the order and his brilliant recent form in domestic circuit influenced them to call him in to be stand-by for injured all rounder Jeevan Mendis, chief national selector Sanath Jayasuriya told Daily Mirror yesterday.
	Jayasuriya added that it would also mean the team might have to use more of Tillakaratne Dilshans hitherto under-utilised spin in the on-going ICC Cricket World Cup.
	The former Sri Lanka skipper gave this explanation when he was asked why they opted to call up an opening batsman in place of an all-rounder who bats in the lower order and bowls a few overs of leg spin.
	Our physio who examined Mendis said it might need more than a week to heal and wanted a scan done to assess the injury. Mendis was sent for an MRI which proved that he had torn a hamstring and is likely to be out of action for nearly two weeks, Jayasuriya said.

Reason why she left the country in a huff
	
	
	Now it is a public secret that the former Madam left the country in a huff.
The initially adduced reason for her sudden departure from the political scene was that she had felt affronted when she was elected as a Patron of the Blue party putting her in the company of the deposed Big Boss. Everyone knows that there is no love lost between the deposed Big Boss and the former Madam.
However, the latest story coming down the grapevine says that the former Madam wanted to be the chairperson or the de facto and de jure head of the Blue party. But the party Constitution requires the Head of State to lead the party as well if that Head happens to be a party member. Her request that she be made at least the Chief Patron of the party too had received no positive response.
According to those close to the former Madam, she is not expected back in the country in the near future.
The absence of the former Madam also means that her sons advent to politics on time to participate in the general elections in the offing goes off the cards.

	A government politico is set to launch a new media venture ahead of the general elections round the corner.
The proposed venture is expected to go in for a multimedia platform including TV and Radio channels as well as national dailies and weeklies in the three main languages.
Some people who have closely followed the political career of the politico say that the latter amassed immense wealth by foul means thanks to the patronage received from a sibling of the deposed Big Boss and he has now embarked on the media venture as a means of laundering the black money he had made during the hay day for his ilk.
The politico  a wizard for taking right political decisions at the right time -- initially entered the Diyawanna House from a district in the North. He is said to be planning to enter the fray close at hand from the Colombo district for reasons yet to be fathomed by analysts. However, it is widely believed that the more cogent reason for him to launch the media company could be a bid to cover up his shady deals of the past by getting the powers that be, beholden to him in return for the media support to be extended to them.
