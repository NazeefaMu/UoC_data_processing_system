An appreciation - Prof. Samantha Hettiarachchi : Bidding adieu to a professor and a gentleman
	
Prof. Hettiarachchi
?
The touching tributes and appreciations for Prof. Hettiarachchi, both in the print media and social media since 24th April this year, bear testimony to the lives he impacted in many ways; as an academic, a teacher and a friend.? ?
Three months since his passing away, I pen these words of appreciation and admiration more from the perspective of knowing him and growing up with him for almost forty years, as my eldest brother-in-law. I was just nine years young when he connected with our family as a ?dear friend? of my eldest sister Premini. I believe our first acquaintance was through the telephone. In an era when the ring tones of our land phones were like clanging cymbals and no CLI, my efficiency as the telephone operator was appreciated by Aiya and to this year he would enjoy mimicking my responses to him over the phone.? ?
?
?
I believe his greatest achievement in University and life?s reward was when he conquered the strongest ?wave of love? in meeting my sister Premini and spending two thirds of his life with her
?
?
Aiya was my sister?s ?world? for almost four decades. In the early years of marriage they were overseas on postgraduate studies, diligently pursuing their academic fields of interest. Imperial College London and the UK were their second homes until about 2005 when, after the Tsunami struck, he was consulted by many countries. This was because he served as a key member of the Advisory Committee of the Disaster Management Centre. Their travels took them to the other continents as well. Prof. Hettiarachchi?s name is synonymous with the University of Moratuwa and the field of Coastal Engineering worldwide.? ?
The tributes paid by students on Facebook, the appreciations by his University colleagues and friends spoke clearly of his personality and character. He was a close friend to many, be it during his college days at S. Thomas? College Mount Lavinia, when he was at the campus or among his students. When one needed simple advice, a brush up in subjects or a patient listener if he would be there. He earned much respect from people from all walks of life for displaying a pleasing manner. He lived a principled life. He spoke out when it really mattered? and never let something wrong go unchallenged. Perhaps that?s what earned him a warm welcome to our family.? ?
Samantha Aiya led by example as he mentored not only the many students, who walked through the corridors of the Civil Engineering Department for thirty eight years, but also mentored and was a great inspiration to his nephews and nieces. He was a dutiful son and a beloved caring youngest brother to his four siblings.? ?
?
?
Though his crowning qualities were his thirst for intellect and academic knowledge, his collection of miniature cars, trains, houses, and wrist watches among other interesting items, were hobbies he cherished
?
On a personal note I am appreciative of an elder brother who admired my various talents and positive outlook on life. He endorsed my professions and offered support, despite me being the non-academic in the family. Being a keen fan of my travels and experiences he would encourage me to diversify my skill in whichever field I pursued. Perhaps one thing we both had in common was that we were ?spoilt youngest?. If there was anything I had which he fancied for his collection of items, his claims on them got the better of me, as I just couldn?t say ?no? to him. In turn, he was sensitive to my point of view in discussions we had with Akka. He had a great memory for insignificant details of events or conversations and years later he would refer to them vividly. He kept track of my closest friends and acquired some ?fans? in them too. Wherever people exchanged greetings with Samantha Aiya, they became fond of him, as he possessed a unique charm and exceptional charisma in addition to a good sense of humour. The past few years he would enjoy posing for a ?click? on my camera as he knew the outcome would be exceptional.? ?
I believe his greatest achievement in University and life?s reward was when he conquered the strongest ?wave of love? in meeting my sister Premini and spending two thirds of his life with her. He couldn?t have asked for more in receiving such devoted care and unconditional love especially in the latter stages of his life while he bravely endured his illness. Akka dedicated all her time to take care of him, while juggling her academic career and house work. Even on his sick bed he would share his knowledge and expertise via email and telephone and mentor a few students who visited him. I recall a few times when I accompanied him for treatment he would enumerate emotionally in detail, the many students and colleagues who showed their gratitude in numerous ways in the last few months of his life. This only bears testimony to the valued legacy he left behind which no wealth can quantify. I can imagine how much more he could have accomplished in his life were it not for his illness.? ?
His avid interest in and valued collection of fountain pens earned him recognition even in other nations through his writings in pen magazines as well. Though his crowning qualities were his thirst for intellect and academic knowledge, his collection of miniature cars, trains, houses, and wrist watches among other interesting items, were hobbies he cherished.? ?
Aiya was not really a ?religious person?; rather he preached a better sermon with his life than with his lips. Whenever I visited them at home during the last year, I was privileged to encourage him with prayer and praise. The night before he passed away, together with a dear friend of mine, by his bedside in hospital, we prayed and sang the famous chorus ?because He lives I can face tomorrow?, little knowing that truly he was ready to face his tomorrow in eternal rest. Thus, till we meet again, a professor and gentleman bade us good bye.? ?

BC to utilize Jakarta Principles when drafting new Bribery Act
	
The Bribery Commission (BC) today said it has been mandated by the Cabinet to draft a fresh Bribery Act and that it would seek recommendations of the Jakarta Principles when drafting it.
Issuing a statement over the Global Expert Group Meeting (EGM) on the Jakarta Principles, the BC said the new Act drafting process will benefit immensely from enhanced clarity, international best practices, and comparative experiences regarding the most important of recommendations contained in the Jakarta Principles.
The three day Meeting which is co-hosted by the Bribery Commission of Sri Lanka, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Sri Lanka, was launched by President Maithripala Sirisena in Colombo today.
Adopted by experts and practitioners at a meeting in Jakarta, Indonesia in 2012, the Jakarta Principles aim to strengthen the effectiveness and independence of anti-corruption authorities around the world.
Present and former heads of anti-corruption authorities from over 30 countries and international anti-corruption experts will attend the meeting.
The EGM is convened to develop a ?Commentary on the Jakarta Statement on Principles for Anti-Corruption Agencies? in response to a request by the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) member states to develop a knowledge base on the effective implementation of Articles 6 and 36 of UNCAC.
The BC said the EGM is a reflection of international recognition of Sri Lanka?s journey towards a corruption free society and the Commission welcomes the invitation to co-host the EGM extended in recognition of its recent active participation in anti-corruption initiatives in the region.
?As the Bribery Commission (BC) has progressed far in the process of drafting the national Anti-Corruption Action Plan, which included island-wide consultations with the public and specialized sectors to solicit their views, it looks forward to strengthening the draft Action Plan with international best practices shared at this forum,? the Commission said.

Businessman seeks compensation for tire damaged on E01
	
A businessman residing in Maharagama has lodge a complaint with the Bandaragama Police yesterday, requesting compensation from the Road Development Authority (RDA) stating that his vehicle?s tire was damaged due to a stone on the Southern Expressway.
In his complaint, the businessman had stated that he entered the expressway from Kottawa and that the front-left tire of his vehicle had been punctured on his journey to Matara.
He had parked his vehicle alongside the road and upon looking for the cause of the puncture had found a rock in the middle of the expressway.
He had then informed the Control Centre of Southern Expressway of the incident. However, it had taken two hours for the recovery vehicle to reach the location.
The businessman stated that the control centre had charged him Rs 2,500 as a toll fee and Rs 250 for a highway ticket. The individual also had an additional expense of Rs 12,500 for a new tire.
The incident had prompted him to seek legal support to recover his losses as the poor condition and maintenance of the Southern Expressway had caused the incident.
The damaged tire was also produced to the Bandaragama Police. (Bimal Shaman Jayasinghe)

Can?t bring in NCM against MR because of an article: Ajith
	
It is not possible to bring in a no-confidence motion against former President Mahinda Rajapaksa just because of an allegation that has been made against him in a newspaper article, Deputy Minister Ajith Mannapperuma said yesterday.
Mr. Mannaperuma said this in response to a question asked?by journalists at a media briefing last morning. He was responding to a question raised by journalists with regard to a report which has said some UNPers have wanted a no-confidence motion brought in against Mr. Rajapaksa.
?We need to have proper information on the allegations if a no-confidence motion is to be brought in. UNP will bring in such a motion only after finding proper facts and proof on the allegation. We cannot bring in any confidence motion because of an allegation made in a news paper article,? he said. (Yohan Perera)

Carry eco certificate always: Police
	
The carrying of Vehicle Emission Test (VET-eco test) certificate had been made compulsory due to complaints about the existence of fake certificates, the Police said today.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror Director of Traffic Administration and Road Safety SP Indika Hapugoda said several rackets had been operating to create forged VET Certificates.
Accordingly, the failure to carry VET Certificate would lead to a spot fine of Rs. 500 following the Extraordinary Gazette Notification that was issued on January 15.
The number of traffic offences that deserve fines had been increased from July 15, which includes the failure of carrying the emission certificate.
Under the important information section of the VET certificate, it clearly mentioned the availability as ?VET Certificate has to be carried with the vehicle? printed on the back of the certificate.
?There is nothing a Police officer could do but implement the law,? SP Hapugoda said.
The Gazette Notice says:
The Emission Certificate and Certificate of Fitness issued in respect of a motor vehicle under this section shall be
(a) carried in that vehicle at all times; (b) made available for inspection on demand by a police officer, Grama Niladhari or Examiner or authorized officer appointed under this Act, or by any person authorized in writing by the Commissioner - General :
?Provided, however, that such certificate shall be produced when required, before a Court, the Commissioner - General or a Licensing Authority,? it said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

China-India in N-E housing tussle: Rajitha
	
A diplomatic wrangling between India and China on the construction of 50,000 houses in the North and East had stalled the project, Cabinet Spokesman and Health Minister Dr Rajitha Senaratne said today.
He told the media at the weekly Cabinet briefing that India?s cost for a unit in the housing project was Rs. 1.3 million, while China quoted Rs. 2.2 million a unit and that India has opposed it.
?We expect to speak to two parties because both countries are our close friends,? he said.
?The Cabinet expects an official report on the issue by next week and I have no doubt that we can resolve this amicably within ourselves,? Minister Senaratne added.
Minister Senaratne said the Government?s main concern was to build houses for displaced people in the North and East and a dispute between two friendly countries must not delay it.
He added that India had already built 40,000 housing units and handed over to displaced families.
Asked whether the issue came for discussion at Tuesday?s Cabinet meeting, he said no and added a committee of officials had been appointed to discuss the matter with both countries and arrive at an amicable solution and submit a report to the Cabinet.(Sandun A Jayasekera)

Contemporary  Iranian art  an eye-opener : Exhibition at Theertha Red Dot Gallery concludes today
	
?
The exhibition of contemporary Iranian abstract art at the Theertha Red Dot Gallery is an eye-opener because the Iranian plastic arts that we are familiar with are traditional. That there is a group of men and women whose artistic instincts and creativity are in synch with what is happening with modern art movements elsewhere certainly came as a novel experience. The exhibition ends today (July 25).? ?
Abstract art may seem to be a misnomer because the exhibit includes portrait works. But faces, too, can become abstractions, vehicles for an idea or a world view gestating in the artist?s mind, like in the 13 black and white ink portraits titled ?Hope? by Omid Shayan.? ?
?
The artist says even this cannot be publicly exhibited in Iran, which leads to an interesting question about our artists. There is no censorship on nudity as a subject in the plastic arts in Sri Lanka, but so few artists work with it. It?s a major part of the foundation of drawing in art schools all over the world
?
Two of the artists -Nasim Pirhadi and Marjan Habibian- were present. Nasim, currently living in Sri Lanka, works as the curator of Red Dot. Talking to them about the contemporary art scene in Iran was quite enlightening.? ?
Non-traditional Iranian artists work under constraints hard to imagine in this country. That doesn?t mean this is a paradise for groundbreaking, challenging art in whatever form. But the Iranian situation, where art is censored by dogma, is alien to us.? ?
?
Culture shock
That?s why what?s evident at this exhibition comes as a kind of culture shock of a pleasant sort. What these Iranian artists have achieved is quite remarkable. Some of them live and work abroad, but they aren?t exiles. They have a base and following in Iran, and this isn?t some underground movement. Centered in Tehran, they exhibit openly, discuss and sell their work to private collectors.? ?
Nasim Pirhadi?s exhibit titled ?Audience? consists of a series of spherical paintings and an audio installation. While a number of small, painted circles hang from the ceiling in a white space, gently swaying in the wind, the audio imposes a consistent drilling noise over the almost sepulchral silence. These are Tehran street noises. It sounds like a robotic invasion of a very civilized, private world.? ?
The paintings themselves, almost all in monochrome, are enigmatic. Alongside large swathes of black ink, you can see miniature figures. Some are human, some are animal, goat-like figures. The human figures may be seated, and absorbed in their own private worlds. Sometimes, they are in suspension, like the animal figures which may be scaling difficult heights or falling. They are all in a very delicate equilibrium. Despite the overall tranquility of this installation, there is an underlying sense of impending trouble, even violence, accentuated by that monotonous and insistent drilling noise.? ?
Audience 2 (acrylic on canvas) has two large spheres and three small ones where similar motifs are repeated. The large one has a miniature, seated figure looking through a telescope. There also is an animal tied feet up to a bar, as if for slaughter. Another sphere has a large vortex on the left, with a tiny group of seated figures to the right. Are they going to be sucked in to the vortex? Again, we face the same unsettling questions.? ?
?
?
The Iranian revolution wiped out a good part of this Westernised Iranian culture. These two couples, staring at us in total ignorance of the mayhem to come, look smug within their embroidered frames
?
Marjan Habibian has a series of ink drawings using pen and roller. There are portraits of her mother. An art teacher, who now lives in Austria, she has made hundreds of portraits of her mother. An admirer of Matisse, one can see the same sureness of line in her work. Her drawings of a cat and a deer place her firmly in that early 20th century European drawing tradition. There are three male nudes and one female. They emphasise a withered, reposeful sexuality, a memory of the past, and not anything sensual or erotic.? ?
The artist says even this cannot be publicly exhibited in Iran, which leads to an interesting question about our artists. There is no censorship on nudity as a subject in the plastic arts in Sri Lanka, but so few artists work with it. It?s a major part of the foundation of drawing in art schools all over the world (except perhaps in very conservative societies), but most of our artists are so bad at drawing the human figure without clothes. What is the reason for prudery? It looks as if the artists themselves practise self-censorship. That will hardly make for progress in art.? ?
?
?
The most disturbing exhibit
Negin Javaher offers three smaller nudes in colour. Fleshy, Lucian Freud like figures, they can be compared to miniatures, a Persian concept. But they are not placed in a specific cultural setting. Like much of modern art, they create their own contexts, leaving the viewer to making the connections.? ?
Azam Tababei has the most disturbing exhibit, the photo installation titled ?Inhibition and Self-Discovery.? Through a series of large black and white prints, she explores a fascinating relationship with a number of female mannequin figures. These are reduced to lower bodies, and amputated hands smeared with paint which resembles blood, looking even more sinister in black and white.?
?
Non-traditional Iranian artists work under constraints hard to imagine in this country. That doesn?t mean this is a paradise for groundbreaking, challenging art in whatever form. But the Iranian situation, where art is censored by dogma, is alien to us
?
?
Hung in between these disturbing images are small plastic bags with chocolate fingers inside, which the artist has made herself. You can?t escape the fingers in these images. They are smeared. The artist is seen in one, smacking them. Or she could be seen as a demonic figure trying to devour her own fingers? Are they smeared with blood, or chocolate? No matter what, there is something very disturbing about it. She?s performing a self-consuming task, and this is a laconic statement about the self-consuming tasks that many people focus on during their lives.? ?
The amputated mannequins? hands reach out for each other. One can sense a desperate search for longing and intimacy. Azam Tababei?s mannequin characters ? and she includes herself amongst them ? are victims, but they haven?t lost the capacity to feel and reach out.? ?
Javid Ramazani?s exhibit of two black and white portraits dating back to WWII, is an attempt to recapture a vanished past. This is poignant because that past isn?t the victim of the normal passage of time, as it happens to peacetime generations. The Iranian revolution wiped out a good part of this Westernised Iranian culture. These two couples, staring at us in total ignorance of the mayhem to come, look smug within their embroidered frames. But they look pathetic when considering the historical context.? ?
Atefah Khas? Hair series uses the sensuousness of a woman?s hair to make an artistic statement about the feminine condition. She offers a photographic print of her auburn-coloured hair. Below it, you find strands of her real hair on a white pillow. It looks like a relic and an offering to eternal youth this hair will not age. There?s no clue as to what the owner looks like. As such, the hair itself becomes epicenter of feminine mystique and allure.? ?
Omid Shayam?s 13 ink portraits titled ?Hope? are enigmatic. They represent faces from the 16th to 18th centuries. Judging by their clothes, they are Europeans. There is one African or African-American woman. Her earrings, in the shape of a cross, suggest a colonial background. Who are these people? They are certainly not Van Gogh?s potato eaters. More likely, they belong to the class of people who could afford to have their portraits painted. But this artist has recalled them from the past.? ?
These images are connected to the video installation, made in Paris, where the artist and a multi-ethnic group are reading ?Rubaiyat? by Omar Khayyam. It is no co-incidence. Khayyam?s vision of people living the good life, not knowing the ultimate futility of it, is reflected in these somber, dignified portraits.? ?
Some of these works are good examples of how to work to the limit within sanctions. It calls for both daring and imagination. In Sri Lanka, unfortunately, we rarely see such examples. Our artists are by and large content to perform way beneath the limits, often choosing the well trodden path of self-censorship.? ?

## Title: Darkness of Black July; nothing has changed after 35 years

Darkness of Black July; nothing has changed after 35 years
	
Yesterday, July 24 marked the 35th anniversary of the 1983 anti-Tamil riots or the commonly known ?Black July.? Much water has flowed under the bridge since that national shame. It is an even bigger shame that the country is still without a clue as to how to find a lasting solution to the root cause of the issue -- ethnic problem -- that triggered the riots. All stake holders of the problem -- the government, Tamil leaders and nationalist forces on either side of the ethnic divide -- are politically and ideologically still back at square one.? ?
The Black July was a week when the entire country was at a standstill due to riots where goons torched the houses of Tamils, looted their houses at their will apart from killing hundreds of them for no reason. The country witnessed total anarchy with no signs of the existence of a government in?the country.? ?
It was said that the riots were organized by the then ruling party and the goons used the electoral registers to single out houses owned by Tamils in towns where the population was mixed. Whether it was state sponsored or not, it is clear that the riots were ignited due to the folly of the government of the day. Goons started mayhem after the bodies of 13 soldiers killed by the LTTE at Thinnaveli, Jaffna on the previous night were flown to Colombo for the last rites at the Kanatte cemetery. Later the government was blamed for taking them to Colombo instead of sending them to the respective villages.? ?
It is wrong to describe, as many do that the Black July was the starting point of the thirty year long war that might have claimed nearly a hundred thousand lives of soldiers, members of various armed groups and civilians belonging to all three major communities of the country. Even prior to this catastrophe, police stations at Annakottai and Chavakachcery had been attacked by the PLOTE and the LTTE respectively. Yet, it is not gainsaying that Black July and the immediate consequent events resulted in the strengthening of the Tamil armed groups and a leap in the violence against the state. It also paved the way for foreign interference, especially that of India.? ?
At the beginning the government was attempting only to militarily crack down on the Tamil armed groups. It was India that persuaded or in fact forced the Sri Lankan government led by President J. R. Jayawardene to talk to the armed groups, and it was the same India that laid the ideological foundation -- the concept of devolution -- for the talks. Former TULF Parliamentarian and a constitutional expert, Dr. Neelan Thiruchchelvam once in a newspaper article quoted former Indian Foreign Secretary Gopalaswamy Parthasarathy as saying that it was with great difficulty that he (Parthasarathy) convinced the acceptability of devolution of power to President Jayawardene, despite the latter also being a constitutional expert. Parthasarathy was India?s first special envoy to handle the Sri Lankan ethnic issue.
Then the history saw a plethora of peace attempts with and without foreign mediation or facilitation, The All Party Conference (APC) of 1984, Thimpu talks of 1985, Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987, Political Party Conference (PPC) of 1989, peace talks between the Premadasa government and the LTTE in 1989/90, Talks between Chandrika Kumaratunga government and the LTTE in 1994/95, Liam Fox agreement and the peace initiatives with Norwegian mediation under President Kumaratunga, Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe and President Mahinda Rajapaksa were the main among them. So many constitutional reform packages were also put forward by the governmental and the nongovernmental entities for the resolution of the problem, only to be vetoed by one or the other major party to the problem.? ?
Yet, even after 34 years of those efforts, we have not changed. The stakeholders are still debating over the very basic points pertaining to the problem -- whether there is an ethnic problem in the country, the aptness of devolution of power as a solution, the acceptability of federalism as a mode of governance etc. with no party willing to come down from their stance. Isn?t it a bigger shame than the Black July??

Demilitarise North as gesture of reconciliation: UN Rapporteur
	
Sri Lanka should urgently reform all the institutions of the Security Sector to place them under full civilian control and should demilitarise the Northern Province as a symbolic gesture of reconciliation and trust-building, UN Special Rapporteur Ben Emmerson said.
In his report, which is based on findings of the mission to Sri Lanka from July 10-14 in 2017, the Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms while Countering Terrorism Ben Emmerson said he was particularly concerned about the ?very large and imposing? presence of the military in the North.
?While the Rapporteur understands that the military undertakes important re-construction work in that part of the country, he is also conscious of the highly symbolic value of its presence. The pervasive lack of accountability for the war crimes that were perpetrated during the war, the climate of impunity that prevails within the security sector, the overwhelming economic weight of the military, its involvement in civilian activities, as well as the overwhelmingly Sinhalese Nationality within the military all contribute to perpetuating the resentment and disenfranchisement felt by the Tamil community as a whole,? the report which was released by the UN on Monday said.
It said a vetting process should be developed to ensure that all security personnel and public officials involved in Human Rights violations are removed from service.
?Also ensure that the security sector, in particular in the police, intelligence services and the military, adequately reflects the ethnic and linguistic makeup of the country,? it said.
The report said the Special Rapporteur had been repeatedly assured by Sri Lanka that there was no discrimination against the Tamils; that criminal law had been used against the LTTE, only; that ill-treatment was a greater challenge in the South than in the North and East of Sri Lanka.
?At the same time, a pervasive and insidious form of stigmatization of the Tamil community was observed. Tamils are severely under-represented in all institutions, particularly in the security sector and the judiciary, despite the importance of ensuring that all institutions adequately reflect the ethnic, linguistic and religious make-up of the State,? Emmerson said in the report.
Meanwhile, he said President Maithripala Sirisena sought to shield a former Army General from a criminal complaint which accused him of command responsibility for war crimes.
?This falls far short of Sri Lanka?s international commitment to achieve a lasting and just solution to its underlying problems. It is indeed difficult to resist the conclusion that the inertia in implementing the reform package that is resolution 30/1-including repealing the PTA, adopting new human rights compliant counter-terrorism legislation and above all to accountability,? he said.
However, he said that Sri Lanka seemed to have turned a corner with new elections brought to power a coalition government and with it the promise of change.
?The UNHRC resolution 30/1, co-sponsored by Sri Lanka, set out key goals for reconciliation, transitional justice, accountability and reform of the security sector, including the counter-terrorism framework. Yet, after a two-year extension granted to the Government in resolution 34/1, progress in achieving the key goals seems to have ground to a virtual halt. None of the measures so far adopted to fulfil Sri Lanka?s transitional justice commitments is adequate to ensure real progress,? Emmerson said.
He said that there were some very slight indications of positive movement in the direction of the transitional justice reforms and welcomed the enactment of a legislation incorporating the International Convention for the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearances.

Discretion was not part of his valour!
	
?
The controversial provincial chief who had become an irritant to both his party and to the Centre from the very outset, is now all set to embark on his own political journey, they say.
?
His plan to contest the upcoming provincial poll from his own political party is expected to mark the severance of all his ties with the main alliance in the North.?
Reports from the North say that a good number of prominent politicos from the province have already rallied round him endorsing his hardline stance regarding the main issues relating to the community.? Even Kala Madam who stirred up a hornet?s nest in the South by publicly welcoming the return of an LLTE rule has already thrown in her lot with the provincial chief.
The provincial chief has already begun meeting the diplomats from powerful countries in the West based in Colombo to seek their assistance for implementing the political agenda of
his new party.
However, his very first meeting with the diplomatic community had run into trouble thanks to his loose tongue.
It has now transpired that a diplomat from a country sharing borders with the States where there is a strong presence of the diaspora is the one our man first met.?
Given the traditional protocol bars foreign diplomats from meddling in the internal political affairs of their host country, this diplomat had extracted a solemn promise from the provincial chief to keep their meeting a secret.?
However, the provincial chief never used to guard his tongue had spilled the beans the following day itself.?
The diplomat who soon learnt about the provincial chief going back on his promise to keep their powwow under his hat had reportedly gone livid and lost no time in rebuking the chief.?
This diplomat, said to be the senior most diplomat in the country, has now issued a standing order to his juniors to give a wide berth to the provincial chief in future, they say.

Galle Stadium: Minister to discuss with UNESCO before making decision
	
Sports Minister Faiszer Musthapha is to discuss the fate of the Galle Cricket Stadium with UNESCO officials before taking a final decision on the matter this week, a spokesman from the Ministry said yesterday.
In all probability the Galle Cricket Stadium will remain as it is after removing the offending infrastructure about which the UNESCO has raised concern, the official explained.
The Cabinet had taken up the issue yesterday and entrusted Minister Musthapha with the task of discussing the matter with the UNESCO in a bid to resolve the issue without affecting the interests of all stake holders, the spokesman said.
?Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) has obtained the necessary permission from all relevant parties before constructing the new structure in 2007 after the 2004 tsunami destroyed most of the stadium,? the spokesman said.
The Urban Development Authority (UDA) has given approval to the SLC to construct a new stadium on March 2, 2007. Approvals were also sought and received from the Department of Archaeology, the Galle Municipality, UNESCO (under certain conditions) and the Galle Heritage Foundation to construct the stadium. It was also revealed that the structure in question ?Mahinda Rajapaksa Stadium? is built at the same height as the newly constructed Galle Bus Stand.
The spokesman said Minister Musthapha will hear arguments from all the parties involved in the controversy before taking a final decision. He will assess the concerns raised by UNESCO, the SLC, Galle Municipality and more importantly the public and cricket lovers in Galle before making his decision. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

?ITU General Secretary had informed us that they were concerned with the proposed Loon project as it might disturb other countries in the neighbourhood if the project operated on 700Mz.
?However it could disturb only if a balloon is located above Jaffna. I assured him that Government and Google would assure that balloon would be placed over the Southern part of Sri Lanka. ?Mr Zhao then accepted our stand and agreed to have another discussion. Therefore we will form a working group and have another round of discussion,? the minister said.
Also, Mr Fernando said he had informed the ITU General Secretary that the Government wanted to team up with Google and make a change in the IT Sector in the country.
He said the loon project would help expand 4G in all parts of the country.

Govt. writes off micro finance loans up to Rs. 100,000
	
Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera has announced that the government would write off the non-consumption loans granted to women by all registered finance companies up to Rs. 100,000.
He said the government had also decided to introduce an interest rate cap of
30 per cent per annum on all future loans given by microfinance companies.
The decision was taken by the Cabinet of Ministers, on the recommendation of the Minister Samaraweera.
?This scheme will initially be limited to women who have obtained microfinance loans for non-consumption purposes in the drought-affected districts of Trincomalee, Ampara, Batticaloa, Jaffna, Mullaitivu, Kilinochchi, Vavuniya, Mannar, Kurunegala, Puttalam, Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa where cultivations were affected consecutively for five seasons,? the minister said.
Accordingly, women who had obtained loans amounting to Rs 100,000 and below can apply for a complete write-off of the loan, he said. ?The General Treasury will reimburse the loss incurred by the microfinance companies for having written off the capital component of the loans. The government has allocated Rs 500 million for this year to initiate the reimbursement programme. The microfinance companies will have to absorb the interest component of the loans written off," he said.
The persons who are benefited by this debt relief programme will be included on a priority basis to provide new loan facilities launched under the Enterprise Sri Lanka programme with a maximum of a two-year grace period, he said.
Microfinance institutions are currently providing microloans without collateral via a door-to-door strategy quoting high-interest rates starting from 40 per cent to 220 per cent per annum for women seeking economic relief and income generation sources. When multiple loans are obtained under the microfinance scheme, people have to pay a much higher interest than the initial loan amount due to the higher interest premium. So the government has intervened in a timely manner to protect rural women from falling into a debt trap by imposing an interest rate cap of 30 per cent on future loans, he emphasised.

He has lost his credibility now!

There is a tough- talking JO politico from the upcountry who is buried in litigation up to his neck.?
?
This worthy would meet the military sibling of the R-family in the morning and would call on the political sibling of the family at noon. One would find him again with the former strongman in the same day evening, they say.
The three siblings had recently discovered that this politico is in the habit of giving the three of them three different versions of the same matter. One sibling who has got furious over certain statements made by this politico which proved to false and misleading is said to be waiting to challenge his credibility.
The gabby politico now suspect in the eyes of the three siblings is likely to fall into more hot water because of his unguarded tongue, they say.

Hoping against hope?
	
?
The bulky and swarthy one who lost his portfolio due to his involvement in the bond scam is a never- say- ?die? character hoping to make a comeback with a big bang, they say.?
?
The man is said to be pressing the powers that be to restore him to his former glory citing numerous reasons why they should meet his demand.?
His main pillar of strength is his party. Long John is reportedly doing his best behind the scene to help his colleague to make an early comeback and in a message sent to Number One he had claimed that there would not have been a regime called ?yahapalanaya? today if there were no fighters like the swarthy one to form the vanguard of the struggle.
Meanwhile, the swarthy one had met Number One on the eve of the latter?s departure for Rome and managed to extract a promise from him to seriously consider his request on his return to the country.? No sooner had this bit of news reached two or three erstwhile? ?colleagues of the swarthy one, they had gone into a flurry of activity in a bid to reverse a possible move that could put the man back on the saddle. Meanwhile, the former strongman who got wise to the ongoing machinations against him, had given him a friendly call to him.
The former strongman who inquired after his health and conveyed his best wishes to him, they say.

I never took orders from members of the Rajapaksa family
	
?
I have my own personality and therefore I wasn?t affected by the heat of the throne
	?
	I was employed at a level where I didn?t have to accept orders
	?
	Gotabaya is a person who can identify the skills of each person and is an efficient manager
	?
	In addition there were many untruths revealed from opposition platforms about the Rajapaksa Government
	?
	To quote one example a letter given to Basil today will be made available even after 10 years when requested
?
Secretary to the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Lalith Weerathunga, in an interview with our sister paper Deshaya spoke about the charisma of the ousted president, the times during which the war raged and the controversial manner in which former Army Commander Sarath Fonseka was arrested. This marks the first time during the past four years that Weerathunga obliged to grant an interview to?a newspaper.? ?
Excerpts:? ?
?
?Q? You were the head of the Government services and served as the Secretary to the President during a period of ten years. How do you feel when you reminiscence the past?? ?
There is only one President for the whole country. Rajapaksa was my chief and he was a political leader. As his secretary I had to implement his political vision. Whatever happened I am happy even today because I was the Secretary of the Leader of the State who ended a war that ravaged the country for 30 years. I was one of those people who was very close to the war.? ?
?
?Q? Before you became the Secretary to the President you were the additional secretary to the Late Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike. What is the difference between that era and the era?of Rajapaksa?? ?
Madam possessed a distinct personal strength and a leadership, which the public respected, and accepted. As the first woman Prime Minister of the world and as the leader of the party she aspired to be a firm leader. At that time the secretary to the Prime Minister was Hemasiri Fernando who created opportunities for me to work closely with Madam.? ?
?
?Q? The post of Secretary to the President is considered as a position that feels the heat of the throne. Did you also have that feeling?? ?
You should direct that question to my friends and the public. If I had behaved like having experienced that heat you wouldn?t be speaking to me now. There is a saying that danger accompanies positions. I was born into a middleclass family in Matara. I have my own personality and therefore I wasn?t affected by the heat of the throne. However I was a workaholic, with a yearning to complete the tasks well and on time.? ?
?
?Q??The post of President is held by a human being and sometimes his decisions may be wrong. On such occasions did you point out the errors he made?? ?
He never asked me to do anything that was wrong. But when there were shortcomings, with regard to policy decisions, I pointed them out in public. Later when the mistakes were pointed out to him he allowed me to do the correct thing. There were many among us who were close to him, who pointed out the shortcomings in the decisions that were taken.? ?
?
?Q? Despite the advise you offered, didn?t the President order you to follow his instructions?? ?
Never. That is why we are a happy lot today. The batch of officers of the former Government was so good and no other Government had officers of that type. This fact is now even more evident.? ?
?
?
First and foremost the credit should be given to Alok Prasad who was the Indian High Commissioner in Colombo then. The false beliefs that were dominating in India about the war were swept aside by him
?
?Q? Who were the officers within who advised the President???
Myself, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, P.B. Jayasundera, Gamini Senarath, Ajith Nivard Cabraal, H.M.G.S. Palihakkara, Palitha Kohona and D. Dissanayake.? ?
?
?Q??When implementing the President?s decisions were there occasions when things went wrong?? ?
Certain difficult decisions were arrived at and implemented as ours. We always obliged him. He is a politician. He is the one who faced elections. He never forgot about this fact.? ?
?
?Q??Do you infer that you ate curd and treacle using a razor?? ?
To tell you the truth, he never put us in?difficult situations.? ?
?
?Q??During the recent past there were many allegations against the Rajapaksa Government with the main one being that the country was being ruled by the Rajapaksa family. The names of Shiranthi Rajapaksa, Namal, Yoshitha, Gotabhaya, and Basil were mentioned often.? ?
Since the president was their relative there must have been some concerns. But they never interfered in our work and never asked us to do this and that. There were occasions when proposals were presented. But no orders were given as I was employed at a level where I didn?t have to accept orders. It was a job where friendly overtures?were made.? ?
?
?Q? Many are of the opinion that Gotabaya Rajapaksa is a person who does what he thinks fit and is a tough guy. Your comments.? ?
Gotabaya is a person who can identify the skills of each person and is an efficient manager who can make use of the talents and skills of such persons. Without the skills of such a person institutions like the state intelligence cannot be put into operation.? ?
?
?Q? What can you say about Basil Rajapaksa?? ?
He is a person who has done politics for a long time. There were instances when he took firm decisions. To quote one example a letter given to Basil today will be made available even after 10 years when requested. He had such organizing capabilities which I hadn?t witnessed elsewhere.? ?
?
?Q??During your time of service the crucial decisions to remove Mangala Samaraweera and Anura Bandaranaike from the Rajapaksa Cabinet were taken. How were these decisions taken?? ?
There were serious diplomatic reasons behind the scene which compelled us to take these crucial decisions. Basil wasn?t in agreement. But when President Rajapaksa takes a decision it?s final. We were only left with the task of implementing them.? ?
?
?Q? Anura was the son of the founder of the SLFP and Mangala was the one who performed an enormous task to bring Mahinda Rajapaksa to power. Why were they treated in this manner?? ?
I cannot discuss these matters with you publicly, which were known to President Rajapaksa. When he was on the march towards winning the war he never condoned the action of those who were trying to topple the Government. He had no mercy for them.? ?
?
?Q??After the successes of the war some began to address Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Great King. Some ministers tied state officials to trees in public. Some powerful individuals organised night races in Colombo and Kandy. The Government was ridiculed by these actions. As state officials, who were practical, why did you fail to point out these lapses to the President?? ?
We witnessed these lapses and agreed that these were things that should not have happened. We made our position clear on this and made alternate proposals. These may have been ignored due to other interventions. Though not a King people accepted Mahinda Rajapaksa as their king . They worshiped him even today as before. Look at the way he is welcomed wherever he goes. He never asks for such a reception, but people spontaneously gather to welcome him.? ?
?
?Q??Then what about the Night Races and the tying up of a state official by a minister?? ?
We voiced our disapproval against Night Races, but for some reason our opposition was heeded. We protested against the tying up of the official. Several other state officials joined me in protesting against this matter. State officials were angry with us for not taking any action regarding this matter.? ?
?
?Q? Back then, despite the fury of the Government service employees, decisions were taken and work was carried out. At present there is an allegation that no decisions are being taken and no work is being done.Your comments?? ?
Back then the Government looked after and safeguarded those in the Government service. Today this environment isn?t there, hence many of them remain unprotected. At that time there were many who worked untiringly and earned the goodwill and the appreciation of the Leader of the State.? ?
?
?Q? Is there any other reason other than insecurity that is causing this?present situation?? 
At that time there was just one leader who possessed the Mahinda Chinthanaya. There were 624 activities incorporated therein. We had only to implement them. Today even those in the Government are questioning whether there is a vision like that?? ?
?
?Q? Do you think it was correct that Sarath Fonseka, who contributed immensely towards winning the war in the North, should have been stripped of his position and later be arrested??
There may have been many security reasons to have him stripped of his position. The State Leader would have feared and harboured suspicion regarding the environment that Fonseka had built up in the Army at that time.? ?
?
?Q? When you reminisce how the Commander of the Army was taken into custody and the actions that followed, what do you think?? ?
I do not approve them. Even today I am not aware as to what made them do it. At that time the story that circulated was that it was the work of Gotabaya Rajapaksa. I know for certain that it was a complete canard.? ?
?
?Q? What was the secret behind Mahinda Rajapaksa winning the war?? ?
Mainly it was the political leadership, followed by the contributions made by the Defense Ministry and the Tri Forces.? ?
?
?Q? In 1987 J.R. Jayewardene stopped the war in Wadamarachchi due to the Indian intervention. Can you mention about any such interventions made during the regime of Mahinda Rajapakse to stop the war?? ?
There were influences made by people like then British Premier Gordon Brown, former US Secretary of state Hilary Clinton, Ban Ki Moon and foreign Ministers David Miliband and?Bernard Kushner.? ?
?
?Q? Whatever was said without India the war could not have been won.Your comments.? ?
Their assistance was needed. When we met Prime Minister Man Mohan Singh to discuss this matter he was severely under stress and one time did not allow even a photograph of our meeting to be taken.? ?
?
He ( Mahinda Rajapaksa)never asked me to do anything that was wrong. But when there were shortcomings, with regard to policy decisions, I pointed them out in public. Later when the mistakes were pointed out to him he allowed me to do the correct thing
?
?
?Q? Who was the leading Indian who offered support to win this war?? ?
First and foremost the credit should be given to Alok Prasad who was the Indian High Commissioner in Colombo then. The false beliefs that were dominating in India about the war were swept aside by him. He was the one who apprised Mrs. Gandhi and Prime Minister Man Mohan Singh that if this war was not ended, India would be the next target. R.K. Narayanan, the Indian National Defense Consultant, and Foreign Secretary Sivashankar Menon offered us huge support. Narayanan had a great liking towards Gotabaya and Sarath Fonseka. The Indian Government helped us so much that during the final few days of the war some of the leaders left Delhi and continued extending us support by allowing us to finish the war.? ?
?
?
Our President remained calm for about 15 seconds and said, ? Mr. Minister please remember that Sri Lanka is no more a colony of England. I am finishing this war. You go and tell your western allies that I said so
?
?
?Q? Do you remember how during the final phase of the war the foreign Ministers of UK and France came in search of the then President and they having a decisive discussion in Embilipitiya under the shade of a tree on the bank of Chandrika Wewa?? ?
Their message was similar to a threat. UK Foreign Minister Miliband had reportedly told President Rajapaksa that they had come all the way to convey a message from the rest of the world. The message was to immediately stop the massacre.? ?
?
?Q? What was President Rajapaksa?s reply to them?? ?
We were not prepared for it. Our President remained calm for about 15 seconds and said,? Mr. Minister please remember that Sri Lanka is no more a colony of England. It ended in 1948. I am the President now elected by the people and my responsibility is towards the people of this country. I am finishing this war. You go and tell your western allies that I said so?. The French Minister of Foreign Affairs Bernard Kouchner at that moment barged in saying, ?Mr. President you are a friend of ours? Then in rebuttal our President said, ?I know very well who my friends are. When our people get killed by bombs exploded by the LTTE it is only a news for you, but remember it is a great heart pain for me?.? ?
?
?Q? President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was glorified by the people after winning the war, lost the 2015 Presidential Elections. Didn?t you get a hint during the final two years of the previous Government that it was degenerating?? ?
I did. We made our observations, but the powerful groups led them astray. In addition there were many untruths revealed from opposition platforms about the Rajapaksa Government. The people now realise these falsehoods. When he lost people felt as if they too had lost. How is that more than hundreds of people visit him daily even after his defeat.? ?
?
?Q? There were several public servants, holding high posts during the Rajapaksa regime, who slowly walked away from Temple Trees when the results of the elections were being revealed. These individuals returned to accept high positions in the present Government. Don?t you think that this is a great betrayal?? ?
There were people belonging to such groups and it?s amazing how they came into occupy high posts once again. But I cannot name these persons.? ?
?
?Q? If there is a change of Government will they join the new regime too.? ?
It is better not to comment on that now.?
?
?Q? Let us return to a very sensitive question. You are a past pupil of Matara Rahula Vidyalaya and Royal College Colombo. You were very knowledgeable on administrative regulations given your vast experiences. You know the financial regulations by heart. What made you make a slip and walk into the Welikada prison?? ?
I view this incident in a neutral manner. I maintain that I acted correctly. As there is a case I don?t wish to speak further. I only know of what I did therefore there are no regrets. Before this incident during the Rajapaksa Government a certain Minister of Foreign Affairs attempted to post me as the Ambassador in USA. I told President Rajapaksa what was told to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by Former First Field Marshal of India Sam Manexsho, ? Madam you out of respect had proposed to me the post of Indian High Commissioner in Britain. Do you wish that I who commandeered an army of 1.5 million to be under your Foreign Secretary?. In a similar manner I said that I would go home and not return to Government Service.? ?
?
?Q??As the one time head of Government Services, what was your immediate response when the court gave its verdict sentencing you for rigorous imprisonment ?? ?
It was a foregone conclusion and therefore I didn?t take it seriously.? ?
?
?Q??How long were you in prison?? ?
One day in Welikada and 12 days at the Prison Hospital.? ?
?
?Q??There is a saying that it is only during a situation like this that you are able to recognise your friends and enemies. What was your experience like?? ?
We are human beings. During this incident there were many who came forward to help; some who were strangers. Among them were some who never sighted me when I was holding positions. There were some who were willing to pay the fines on my behalf. The only thing I have earned from Government service are human beings.? ?
?
?Q? How did you feel when you wore the jumper inside the prison and partake meals served on zinc plates???
I accepted that with a smile. I then remembered the popular poem by Rudyard Kipling in ?IF? which was translated by my father when I was a child. It goes like this, ? Even if you walk with Kings or even with beggars if you hold your head high, then you are a man my son?? ?
?
?Q? It was heartening to note that at the time you held the post Secretary to the President, your wife was removed from the post she held at that time. What were your thoughts on this? Was it also a painful experience like your prison sentence?? ?
She worked at the Securities and Exchange Commission as its Chairperson. Some of the decisions she had taken at that place were not favoured by many. She became a target of a conspiracy. Many asked me at that time whether I would resign. I told them that our duties differed. There were many who did not like her and what she did. I felt sorry, and if she had continued in that institution she would have reached a very high position. She has been a tower of strength to me during all my ups and downs in life.? ?
?
?Q??You were at one time occupying a comfortable official quarters, but now you are compelled to stay in a rented out house and travel about in a small car. Aren?t you sad about this change of fate??
The vehicle I am using now is owned by a relative of mine who is the owner of Nimal Stores in Matara. He is paying the lease. Earlier, when I was in position, I travelled about in good vehicles. I travelled by bus to school. Though my parents were well educated they never possessed cars. Therefore cars, vehicles, Rolex watches aren?t ornaments to me.? ?
?
?Q??You lost your positions along with all the facilities and ended up being jailed. When events of this nature take place some connect them with astrology. Didn?t you check your horoscope?? ?
I am now experiencing Senasuru Erashtakaya (Influence of Saturn). This brings much malefics. It was predicted that I would experience very hard times and that it would be a miracle if I escaped getting injured.?
?
?Q??On hearing the seriousness of the malefic planetary effects I am eager to know the Zodiac sign under which you were born? ?
?It is Dhanu (Sagittarius). There is a serious malefic or Erashtakaya that would last for several years.? ?

India, UAE help sought to trace SL criminals
	
The government has initiated talks with the authorities of India and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to trace some Sri Lankan underworld criminals living in hiding in these countries, Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said yesterday.
Minister Bandara told Daily Mirror that India had agreed to extend its fullest possible cooperation to trace and repatriate some criminals living there.
?We find that several underworld leaders have escaped to India. They operate their crimes here from India. Also, there are some criminals living in Dubai,? he said.
The Ministers said the police would set up new units to deal with drug trafficking.
?We have increased raids. We deal with all including street pushers,? he said.
Earlier, President Maithripala Sirisena announced that he would implement the death penalty on those convicted for drug trafficking. He said those death row criminals operating drug businesses still from their prison cells would be hanged first. (Kelum Bandara)

New Constitution for Sri Lanka : ten experts working on initial draft of Constitution
	
The Constitution making process is in limbo right now and the ?Yahapalana Government? seems quite contended with the passing of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. Attempts to introduce a new Constitution has come under much criticism by many in the country. The Daily Mirror spoke to the main architect of the drafting of a new Constitution for Sri Lanka, Parliamentarian and Constitutional expert Dr. Jayampathi Wickramarathna on the issue.
?
They believe that Sri Lanka must be in the control of the Sinhala Buddhists. There is no single example in the world where part of a country has used devolved power to break away.
	?
	The Executive President can take over all or part of the functions of a Provincial Council under the proposed Constitutional arrangement or ultimately dissolve the Council. So, what?s more?
	?
	There is no concept called Executive Prime Minister - nowhere in the world. It is Parliament which will exercise executive power through the Prime Minister and Cabinet.?
?
?Q? What is the progress that has been made in drafting a new Constitution by now?
At the second sitting of the Constitutional Assembly held on May 5, 2016 six Sub-Committees were appointed to assist the Steering Committee in its mandate of drafting a constitutional proposal.? ?
The six sub-committees were tasked to discuss and make proposals on Fundamental Rights, The Judiciary, Law and Order, Public Finance, Public Service and Centre ? Periphery Relations.? ?
Each Sub -Committee consisted of 11 members, including the Chairman, as resolved by the Steering Committee at its sitting on May 04, 2016 and subsequently approved by the Constitutional Assembly. The appointment of members to the Sub-Committees was done in an equitable manner taking into consideration party representations within Parliament, and was based on nominations made by political parties. The six Chairmen were appointed from among the members selected to the Sub-Committees and was based on considerations of seniority.? ?
?
The Expert Panel has been working tirelessly and on last 18th met once again and requested for two more weeks. I must say that the Expert Panel has only a Zero Draft? or ?Non Paper? right now before them for the purpose of facilitating future talks.
?
The Sub-Committees were mandated to develop constitutional principles for consideration of the Steering Committee in respect of the designated subject areas. The Sub-Committees functioned independently in determining the manner in which sittings were organized, and were at liberty to engage expertise and to invite representations. The deliberations before the six Sub-Committees were consultative and interactive in nature and included shared experiences and insights on various aspects of the subject matter discussions.? ?
The six sub-committees submitted their reports in the end of September, 2017 to the Constitutional Assembly and as expected different political parties had aired their different views in these reports.? ?
I must admit that after the submission of sub committee reports, the progress on Constitution making process has not been fast tracked. The local government polls and the No-Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe also played a role to slow the progress.? ?
However, in May 2018, the Panel of Experts of the Constitutional Assembly requested to prepare a document ? an initial legal draft ? based on proposals of the six sub committees that includes various views expressed by various political parties.? ?
The Expert Panel has been working tirelessly and on last 18th met once again and requested two more weeks and was given. I must say that the Expert Panel has only a Zero Draft? or ?Non Paper? right now before them for the purpose of facilitating future talks.? ?
?
?Q??One of the major challenges before you is to come up with a basic Constitutional Policy that could garner the support of a two thirds majority in Parliament and political parties, clergy and Maha Sangha in particular. Many who oppose the new Constitution say that you are in a move to divide the country. How are you going to confront this uphill task?
Only a very small section of people say there is an attempt to divide the country. A vast majority of Tamils accept that Sri Lanka must continue to remain as an undivided and indivisible country. The TNA also is in that position. The Federal Party, which is the main constitutional partner of the TNA was taken to the Supreme Court alleging that they were in a move to divide the country. The Supreme Court having gone through all materials put before it rejected that application. A few of those who allege that there is an attempt to divide the country through devolution are Sinhala Buddhist supremacists.? ?
?
The Interim Report of the Steering Committee has very clearly said that Sri Lanka should remain as an undivided, free, sovereign, independent and democratic socialist republic. There should be constitutional provisions to prevent cessation that people enjoy sovereignty as a whole. The power to change the Constitution shall remain with the central legislature and people of Sri Lanka.
?
They believe that Sri Lanka must be in the control of the Sinhala Buddhists. There is no single example in the world where part of a country has used devolved power to break away. In Scotland in the UK power has been drastically devolved not because of devolution alone but because of territorial reasons. In Catalonia, the cry to break away from Spain has got heightened because the central Spanish authorities have been insensitive to Catalonian concerns and complaints at the center has been very inflexible. Like in Sri Lanka, the Central Government in Spain has found various ways and means to frustrate devolution. But if it is even a small part of Sri Lanka, general thinking is that devolution may lead to cessation and as such we must address that concern. The Interim Report of the Steering Committee has very clearly said that Sri Lanka should remain as an undivided, free, sovereign, independent and democratic socialist republic. There should be constitutional provisions to prevent cessation that people enjoy sovereignty as a whole. The power to change the Constitution shall remain with the central legislature and people of Sri Lanka.??
The Provincial Councils have no role in Constitution making. So, it is very clear that Sri Lanka will continue to be a unitary state. In March, 1990 when the Chief Minister of North-East Vardharaja Perumal made his ill advised statement to declare Unilateral Independence in North East, President Premadasa wanted to dissolve the North-East Provincial Council. But the 13th Amendment did not have such provisions, and special laws had to be introduced. However, it was not a Constitutional amendment. The Steering Committee has in its report proposed that the Executive President should have the power to intervene in a province when there is a clear danger to the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the country. The Executive President can take over all or part of the functions of a Provincial Council under the proposed Constitutional arrangement or ultimately dissolve the Council. So, what?s more?? ?
I must say the best proposal for meaningful power devolution came from 7 Chief Ministers of the South. Their proposals are based on 30 years of experience. They have made very good suggestions and all 7 Chief Ministers are from the SLFP.? ?
But I am sorry to say that the SLFP?s own proposals contained in the report don?t go that far although they are not opposed to devolution.?
?
?
Only a very small section of people say there is an attempt to divide the country. A vast majority of Tamils accept that Sri Lanka must continue to remain as an undivided and indivisible country. The TNA also is in that position.
	?
	A few of those who allege that there is an attempt to divide the country through devolution are Sinhala Buddhist supremacists.
	?
	Provincial Councils have no role in Constitution making. So, it is very clear that Sri Lanka will continue to be a unitary state.?
?
?
?Q? Is it going to be a federal system of governance, unitary state, confederation or a union of regions?
It is certainly a unitary state with meaningful devolution. I speak for my party, the United Left Front and LSSP majority group. If I was asked to sum up the aspirations of the people on January 8, 2015, I would say ?Democracy?. So, you want a democratic Constitution.? ?
Development must not be exclusively centric. The President may be given certain powers in relation to PCs. But the President may be elected by Parliament. Colvin R De Silva once said that ?You must never have 2 powers at the apex of the state which act as counter-force to each other.?? ?
The Bill of Rights, brought afresh to the proposed draft includes not only political rights but social, economic, cultural, women and children?s rights, and that is the trend world wide.?
?
?Q? The Constitution and the electoral system are closely linked components in a parliamentary democracy. The Proportional Representation (PR) Voting system has come under a lot of criticism from almost all quarters. To add insult to injury, the newly introduced local government electoral system under which the February local government polls were conducted has also been criticized by voters, political parties, members of the local government bodies and many others. How are you going to tackle this problem?
We are for a new electoral system. A mixed system based on PR and First Past the Post System. The ?Manape? System must come to an end.? ?
?
Development must not be exclusively centric. The President may be given certain powers in relation to PCs. But the President may be elected by Parliament. Colvin R De Silva once said that ?You must never have 2 powers at the apex of the state which act as counter-force to each other.?? ?
?
?
?Q? Sri Lankans will in future have as their Head of State a more powerful President or a President weakened further or a ceremonial Head of State with a Prime Minister with executive powers?
We don?t want power to be centralized in one person or parliament without safeguards. The Power is to the Centre and Province. The subjects of National Security, Sovereignty and Territorial Integrity remain with the centre. The centre should have the power to make National Policy and Standard on all subjects, but the centre must not take back devolved power in the guise of national policy.? ?
There is no concept called Executive Prime Minister - nowhere in the world. It is Parliament which will exercise executive power through the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The Prime Minister will have to go home at any moment if he loses confidence of Parliament.? ?
?
?Q? The two party rule, the unity government or so called Yahapalana Government has been proved a flop. Do you agree?
Yes, to some extent. The 19th Amendment to the Constitution has certain flaws because we were not able to fulfil the aspirations of people and fully abolish the Executive Presidency for which? President Maithripala Sirisena was voted on January 8th, 2015. That was because the government did not have a simple majority, let alone a 2/3 majority. Anyway it is a new experience for the two parties. Unfortunately, our political culture does not support such arrangements because both parties are looking forward to the next election.??
?
We don?t want power to be centralized in one person or parliament without safeguards. The Power is to the Centre and Province. The subjects of National Security, Sovereignty and Territorial Integrity remain with the centre. The centre should have the power to make National Policy and Standard on all subjects, but the centre must not take back devolved power in the guise of national policy.??
?
?
?Q??Are you confident that the new Constitution could be introduced before 2020?
The 10 experts nominated by the Steering Committee and drawn from various professions like engineering, legal, political and academia, with different backgrounds are working on an initial draft based on interim report and 6 sub committee reports which can also be called as a Zero Document or Non Paper to facilitate further discussion. Two of them have already submitted their individual reports.? ?
I must categorically say that Mr. Sumanthiran or myself are not involved in the expert committee work as they work independently, though the joint opposition tries to show a different picture.? ?
The Steering Committee has decided to prepare a final report and we have no involvement in that process either and we have explained this in Parliament last week. The ball is in their court now.? ?

New Constitution only a dream: Ganeshan
	
Introducing a new Constitution is only a dream because the government has run out of time already, National Integration Minister Mano Ganesan said.
He said this at the National Inter-religious Symposium held yesterday at the BMICH. The event was organised by the National Peace Council.
?I personally feel there is a need for a new Constitution as there are so many problems to be solved. However, it was supposed to be introduced during the first year of the ?Yahapalana Government? but we couldn?t make it happen. It is impossible to devise a new Constitution before this government?s term expires,? he said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Opposition to FTAs should not be left unheard: JO
	
The Joint Opposition (JO) yesterday said the government should take into consideration the mounting opposition to the Free Trade Agreements (FTA) without acting in an authoritarian manner.
Addressing a news briefing, Professor G.L. Peiris said that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa considered the grievances of and complaints made by local business community members to the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) during the previous government?s tenure.
?Mr. Rajapaksa informed me of the concerns raised by our businessmen who said CEPA was destructive to them. Mr. Rajapaksa asked me to inform India that we cannot go ahead with the agreement in this manner. However, the incumbent government is not listening to any concerns raised by professionals to the Economic and Technological Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) or the FTA with Singapore,? he said.
He said it was surprising to note that TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran who complained about the lack of Tamil translation of the Bond Commission report, raised no issue when there is only the English copy available on the FTA with Singapore. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Rare opportunity to observe longest lunar eclipse
	
Sri Lankans would have a rare opportunity to observe the longest total lunar eclipse in the 21st century on the night of Friday (July 27) and the early hours on Saturday (July 28).
The Colombo University Astronomy and Space Science Unit Director Prof. Chandana Jayaratna said the total duration of the eclipse is 6 hours and 14 minutes.
The eclipse begins at 10.44 pm, Sri Lanka Standard Time on July 27 when the moon enters into the penumbra - the less dark shadow of the earth and will end up at 4.58 am on July 28.
Prof. Jayaratna said that Sri Lankan would not have the opportunity to see another total lunar eclipse from beginning to the end again till 2025.
?On this day, the earth will pass between the sun and the moon and therefore the moon will disappear into the Earth's darkest shadow, known as the umbra. For one hour and 43 minutes, the moon will disappear from the sky, entirely obscured by the shadow that our planet casts upon it. Given the moon is currently the furthest away in its orbit, it will take longer to pass through the shadow causing the eclipse to be the longest in 100 years?, he said in a statement.
It is also expected to be the longest blood moon witnessed in 100 years. The Moon will be visible in a scarlet red hue for over 1 hour and 43 minutes, which is 40 per cent longer than any other blood moon measured in recent times.
For the naked eye observers, the eclipse will start to see from 11.54 pm when the moon begins to enter into the penumbra-the dark shadow of the Earth.
The total eclipse begins at 1.00 am on 28th morning, the greatest eclipse occurs at 1.51 am, total part of the eclipse ends up at 2.43 am and partial eclipse ends up at 3.49 am on the 28th.
After that the moon will enter into the less dark shadow of the Earth, the penumbra and only the dimming of the Moonlight will occur till eclipse ends at 4.58 am with the moon leaving the penumbral part of the eclipse. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Red signals from two world powers!
	
?
A rumour doing rounds in political circles says that two missives delivered to our Foreign Ministry by two foreign diplomatic missions here have sent the government high-ups into a fluster.? ?
?
The two diplomatic missions represent two powerful countries and the tone of both missives is said to be ominous. Hence the high concern of the top authorities.
Each of these two missives has reportedly raised the grave concern of the guest country regarding certain public statements made by some government bigwigs which they describe as being damaging to its image. One of these two countries, according its missive, is highly perturbed over an allegation being repeatedly made about a monetary donation offered to a prominent candidate at an election here in the recent past.
The missive of the mission representing the other guest country is said to be a hard-hitting reply to an allegation recently made by a senior top team member that the country concerned is bankrolling the JO in a bid to oust yahapalanaya.?
Observers say that Yahapalanaya cannot afford to pooh-pooh these two missives as both are world powers. In fact, we are under much obligation to one of these two countries which is Asian one for pouring precious forex into the exchequer through a series of mega development projects.
By the way, reports say that the envoy from the Asian power who called on a very high political authority here sounded a note of warning about repeat allegations prejudicial to their interests.?

Sahana Medura : A place of comfort for those who need it most
	
?
25 years ago, the state of the country and the war it was involved in, meant that many people were left vulnerable, having lost loved ones, their belongings and their jobs. Many of these people were also mentally affected by the ongoing trouble in the country and found it difficult to continue living a normal life. Aiming to help those who were psychologically affected, the late Rev. Fr. Fraccid Anthony OMI, started a foundation called ?Sahana Medura? in a beautiful environment at Kanuwana in Ja Ela. This? institute celebrates 25 years of valuable service this year.? ?
?
?
Purpose
With the aim of giving comfort to those who needed it the most, Sahana Medura opened the doors to those who had lost parents or children and were wandering the streets, irrespective of creed, caste and religion. They were taken in by Fr. Anthony and his team and were given counselling and psychotherapy to help them deal with their situation and to enable them to return to their normal lives. Along with those who suffered from the psychological effects of the war, there were many other individuals with various other conditions such as autism and Down?s syndrome for which they required long term treatment. This led to the construction of housing facilities which enabled the members to stay at Sahana Medura and take time to recover and return to society. Many inmates have fully recovered and have been able to return to their normal life and are doing well in society today.? ?
Although most of the inmates have psychological problems caused by war and various illnesses, some inmates are also affected psychologically by social problems such as bullying, financial issues, negligence from family, problems at their workplaces, and the lack of acceptance in society. They keep all these troubles bottled up in their mind and it becomes too much for them to bear.
?
Sahana Medura opened the doors to those who had lost parents or children and were wandering the streets, irrespective of caste, creed or religious difference
?
?
This has led to them being psychologically affected. Some inmates were also found to be extremely violent upon their arrival at Sahana Medura. The set programme, counselling and the therapy which the inmates are given help them to deal with and come to terms with their past. It also allows them to release themselves both physically and mentally from the difficulties they face. In addition, the calm environment by which they are surrounded, the love and the affection they are shown have also greatly helped the inmates.? ?
After the sad demise of Fr. Anthony early this year, the Rev. Fr. Prasanna Rodrigo OMI stepped in as Director and passionately continues the work for which Sahana Medura was originally created. With a total of 40 inmates, the staff at Sahana Medura continue to provide them with the help they need to return to their normal lives and fit back into society with ease.? ?
?
?
A day in ?Sahana Medura?
Everyday these wonderful, innocent yet deprived individuals engage in a set programme which starts at 5.30 am. Their day starts with a spiritual session and leads on to many other activities such as music, water, physical and occupational therapy. Throughout various times during this set programme, the inmates are assigned work such as sweeping the rooms, cleaning and looking after the garden and chopping firewood. This enables them to work individually and reflect on their situation and also helps to make their transition back into society easy and comfortable.? ?
?
?
Health and?Well-being?
Fr. Rodrigo makes sure that these inmates are looked after well and has a healthy life and has acquired the services of a qualified psychologist and a therapist to look after and treat these individuals and help them to recover. Further they undergo monthly medical check-ups at the Ja-ela hospital where Fr. Rodrigo accompany them personally.? ?
To ensure their safety, no one is allowed to go out of Sahana Medura alone but the inmates have been given the opportunity to enjoy themselves through activities such as participating in the church feast, enjoying trips and picnics, and also going on pilgrimages. Many volunteers have also visited the inmates of the foundation and have spent time with them, sung songs with them and have taken time to make them feel accepted and loved.? ?
?
?
Support
Along with Fr. Rodrigo and his staff, the foundation is also being looked after and supported by the religious congregation named Oblates of Mary Immaculate (OMI) which covers most of the expenses of Sahana Medura and enable the inmates to live as comfortably as possible. Countless contributions have been made towards the running of the foundation by kind acts such as alms-giving, financial aid and also by providing them with other materials which they require. Volunteers have also chipped in and helped the inmates and the staff by washing their clothes and helping to clean the place.? ?
?
Their Future
In the future, as a congregation, the Oblates of Mary Immaculate plan to gradually change the place into a mental hospital where the inmates can be treated and released back into society instead of having to spend their whole lives at Sahana Medura.?
Sahana Medura humbly request from you, the public who has a passion to make a lonely heart happy that you visit the inmates of Sahana Medura, 6/7, St. Anthony?s Mawatha, Kanuwana,Ja Ela and help put a smile on their faces and show them that they are loved by others and embrace them as brothers and sisters. They also would welcome financial support and any other donations which will be used for the benefit of the innocent inmates.? ?

The deputy has offered this job to the fair and lovely one out of consideration for their past friendship.? From the time this fair one assumed duties, the deputy?s office has become a busy crowded place. A good number of visitors to this office these days happen to be Diyawanna politicos, including purohitas, at all levels.? Some purohitas, in fact, have made it a habit to visit this office even twice a day. They would breeze in hailing the fair one with the stock greeting, ?Ah! Kohomada, Nangi??
There is such an unending stream of visitors, mostly VIPs, to this office, some claim that it could be called one of the busiest places in the Public Sector.? With too many visitors crowding his office, the workaday affairs of the deputy have run disarray and he is said to be cursing himself these days for employing a beauty that led to a situation that he never bargained for, they say.

Suren Ratwatte had been appointed as the CEO of the SriLankan Airlines without a Board Decision, Airlines Company Secretary Dalarene Thirikumar told the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) today.
?There is Board Paper and the appointment was made without a board decision,? she told the Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) on irregularities at SriLankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering and Mihin Lanka today.

Thai cave boys become novice Buddhist monks
	
Most members of the Thai youth football team rescued from the flooded cave have been ordained as Buddhist novices, the BBC reported today.
The group will spend nine days living in a monastery, a tradition for males in Thailand who experience adversity.
They were trapped for more than two weeks before the?dramatic rescue.
The boys were all released from hospital last week and are said to be in good health after their ordeal in the snaking caverns of the Tham Luang caves of northern Thailand.
This step is intended to be a "spiritual cleansing" for the group, and to fulfil a promise by the families to remember the diver?Petty Officer Saman Gunan who died in the rescue operation.
"They should spend time in a monastery. It's for their protection. It's like they died but now have been reborn," Seewad Sompiangjai, grandfather of Night, one of the rescued boys?has?told the BBC earlier. ?
They will stay in different monasteries until 4 August meditating, praying and cleaning their temple. The length of time they will spend doing this - nine days - is a nod to a Thai lucky number.
Correspondents say it's seen as normal by Thais for boys and men to spend time as monks as a rite of passage.
One of the boys, Adul Sam-on, will not be joining the rest of the "Wild Boars" football team as he is a Christian. Their coach Ekkapol "Ake" Chantawong, 25, will join them for the same period of time but as a fully fledged monk rather than a novice.
The coach had spent time in a monastery as a novice before this. Although he has attracted some criticism for taking the boys into the cave, he is also credited with helping them through the ordeal by reportedly teaching them meditation techniques to help them stay calm and use as little air as possible.
The extraordinary story of the group's rescue has been followed by millions worldwide since 23 June, when they walked into the Tham Luang cave after football practice - only to be trapped by sudden monsoon floods.

The never fading blackness of July
	
History repeats itself; first as tragedy and second as farce! - 
Karl Marx
?
As yet another July passes by, the spectre of the Black July haunts the minds; the pogrom that took place in July1983. Penning the very first installment of this column; exactly a year ago, I dedicated it to the memory of those victims of the dreaded Black July, who received neither justice, apology nor compensation. For some, it is, but just a fading memory; some say that such dark passages of history are best left to be forgotten rather than being whipped up thus rubbing salt to the wound. I agree, to a certain extent; but not entirely.? ?
They are best forgotten in a context of little likelihood of repetition or re-occurrence. They are best forgotten if the two communities are in perfect harmony and such reminiscence nothing but an affront to the respective ethnic psyches. But they are not best forgotten, if we seem to be wading across a highly treacherous stretch of troubled waters in terms of ethnic relationships between the majority and the minorities, the Tamils in particular. The educative value of such incidents are immeasurable.?
?
Lessons not learned
Civilized people learn from history. Last year, when I wrote that article, no State Minister had openly invited LTTE to be revived in order to afford safety to children in the North. When I wrote my article, no Eelam map had been paraded in public in religious festivals; no leading monk had invited a Hitler type leader, with zero ethnic tolerance, to take reins of the country.? ?
A lot of water has gushed under the Kelani Bridge since I wrote that article. The ethno-religious political landscape has turned darker by several hues, since then.? ?
At that time the Sinhala polity was not sliding towards the lure of an ethno-religious despot with the aegis of the Maha Sangha. 13 A was under fire alright, but not seen as demonic as it is now by all and sundry. More importantly the Constitutional Amendments, the flagship project of the Yahapalanaya government was in full sway even to the extent of including proposals for making the Sri Lankan state a secular one. Constitutional amendments and efforts at reconciliation are now but the exclusive domain of NGO s and so called ?traitors?. Isn?t it?? ?
?
Winds of change for the worse
All has changed. The TNA is unequivocal in that they feel hard done by the government, which in their mind is the government of the South. We can charge, dismiss, sue or even crucify former State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran for her alleged pro-Tiger rhetoric. After all, if Dr. Deepika Udugama is to be met with death penalty, according to a retired military officer, what more to be said about Vijayakala? The three main national leaders are in a breakneck race to pamper the chauvinistic sentiment in the south with the upcoming electoral battles in mind. They have no important task than going to temples, meeting monks and showing their allegiance with what is now grossly misunderstood as Buddhism.? ?
It was none other than Prabhakaran, who instructed the suicide carders who came to Colombo, that the Sinhalese had very short memories. Well, he got that dead right, didn?t he? We have already forgotten that we have just wriggled out of a 30-year long civil war, unbelievable suffering, unimaginable losses and irreparable damage to our national psyche.? ?
The peace that dawned, albeit through bloodshed, is precious. Or at least, it should be! There is no choice for the three communities but to live in peace.? ?
Three decades have passed us by sending our youth (economically poor) to be slaughtered in palm groves and them sending theirs, even teenagers (yet again poor) to blow themselves up in highways. The toll need not be inexhaustible. The poor youth, too deserve to live!? ?
?
Reconciliation....? Are you kidding?
Why then is the term reconciliation still a figment of the imagination and not yet a reality? Why does it raise eyebrows in the Sinhala South every time it is uttered? Why does it remain a prerogative of foreign nationals to emphasize the importance of this word and not locals.? Why are we so reluctant to acknowledge the fact that the Tamils of the North too has a right to lead a peaceful and civilian life rather than under watchful eyes of the military and intelligence?? ?
On the other hand why aren?t the Tamil leaders, even now unable to comprehend the dynamics of ethnic relations in a country where 2/3 of the population are from the majority and that you need to take cognizance of that fact rather than over estimating their worth just because an electoral system allows them a disproportionately bloated representation in Parliament. Why are they oblivious to the danger that a revival, not necessarily of the LTTE, but of the Tamil militant sentiment in general could bring unbearable suffering and destruction yet again on themselves and their charge?? ?
Until and unless we revisit these issues in a sensible manner, it is imperative to keep reminding ourselves of the lessons that 1983 Black July hold. Never forget that history repeats itself and moves?in circles.? ?
It is an understatement to say the situation is combustible between the two communities concerned. Any one who visits the North could not but feel the ethnic tension that heaves in the background. The response Vijayakala got from the broad masses of Tamils for her perceived bravery is alarming. I have little doubt cometh the next election , she will score a record breaking return for her electorate.? ?
?
The same with the South?
There is already speculation on Hitler-like figures to take reins; it would not only be drug peddlers and the underworld kingpins at the receiving end if that becomes a reality. A ethnic tolerance is fated to be a sure victim of such an all right racist victory; its heal will rise the already lurking Tamil extremist sentiment, thus completing yet another cycle of ethnic violence.? ?
The blame game and finger pointing between the North and the South, leads nowhere; if at all, it does towards self annihilation! We rarely had leaders with vision beyond the obvious and immediate ?next election; to resist the lure of sacrificing all possibilities of genuine reconciliation and long lasting co existence for cheap electoral success. The recent Sinhala-Muslim riots in the Central Province, is nothing but a stark reminder of how combustible ethnic relations are in this country.? ?
?
Blackness never fades?
We do need to remember Black July; not with a sense of vengeance or alternately , with the false complacency that that type of era is well past us. But grasping with every ounce of our intelligence, that for our mere survival, if not for advancement as a nation, we cannot afford to have a repetition, in whatever shape or size.? ?
In that sense, we find ourselves at ground zero; Square One! The Blackness of July has not faded with time as some would love to believe and conveniently declare.? ?
And I would keep on writing about the Black July year, after year, after year....? ?

Underground lake of liquid water detected on Mars
	
A lake of liquid water has been detected by radar beneath the southern polar ice cap of Mars, according to a new study by Italian researchers from the Italian Space Agency, published Wednesday in the journal Science.
Evidence was gathered by the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding instrument, also known as MARSIS, on the European Space Agency's Mars Express spacecraft.
Between May 2012 and December 2015, MARSIS was used to survey the Planum Australe region, which is in the southern ice cap of Mars. It sent radar pulses through the surface and polar ice caps and measured how the radio waves reflected back to Mars Express.
Those pulses reflected 29 sets of radar samples that created a map of drastic change in signal almost a mile below the surface. It stretched about 12.5 miles across and looked very similar to lakes that are found beneath Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets on Earth. The radar reflected the feature's brightness, signaling that it's water.
"We interpret this feature as a stable body of liquid water on Mars," the authors wrote in the study.
The study authors ruled out any other causes for this brightness.
Previously, there have been some suggestions about water on Mars, like droplets of water condensing on the Phoenix lander or as the possible cause of recurring slope lineae, which are seasonal dark streaks on Martian slopes. But there hasn't been evidence of stable bodies of water until now, the researchers said. However, the presence of liquid water at the base of Martian polar caps was first hypothesized in a study 31 years ago.
Given its location beneath the polar ice cap, the water is expected to be below the freezing point of water. But salts like magnesium, calcium and sodium already found on Mars could help the water to form brine, which would lower the melting point to allow the lake to remain liquid.
On Earth, lakes exist below the Antarctic ice sheet even though the mean annual temperature is around negative 76 degrees Fahrenheit. Brine lakes on Earth can remain liquid at 8.6 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the study. In comparison, salty ocean water freezes at 28.4 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Much like our own ice sheets, the polar ice caps change depending on the climate and act as archives for what has happened in the past. Learning more about these caps can reveal Mars' climate history. (CNN)

?
Giants in the media field, who held the post of Editor-in-Chief of leading newspapers in both Sinhala and English, like D. F. Kariyakarawana, Dharmapala Wettasinghe, Edmond Ranasinghe, Rex De Silva and Gamini Weerakoon had a high regard for him.? ?
A special innovative feature introduced by him was to carry pictures with a width of 8 columns and accompanied by equally large headlines in the front page of the newspaper in case of natural disasters like floods, landmines or claymore explosions, during the war. This is a popular practice followed by newspapers today.?
However it is sad that Merrill has been incapacitated by illness since 2005. He is in this condition due to a slipped disk he suffered as a result of sitting for long hours at office. He was forced to spend his EPF funds to obtain treatment at hospitals like Sri Jayewardenepura and Nawaloka. He even received medication at Apollo in India and Mt. Elizabeth in Singapore. Merrill who was subject to several surgical operations showed signs of recovery, but he was?paralyzed afterwards.? ?
Contributions received from the President?s fund for his treatment during the tenure of President Mahinda Rajapaksa were used to obtain treatment at hospitals in Sri Lanka and abroad.? ?
At present he is spending his life as an invalid, all alone in his small house in Panadura.? ?
He spends the day reading his books repeatedly. He specially checks his bank passbook to find whether any sympathizer has made a contribution, generous acts which help him keep his head high during this troubled time.? ?
Those who wish to help him financially can do so by making a contribution to A/C 104753754756 which is maintained at Sampath Bank under his name. Merrill can be reached on his mobile phone (0766 227263)??

WHERE ARE WE HEADING?
	
?
?
Where indeed is our country heading??? Capital Punishment has finally been introduced but to no avail!!! Murderers are NOT ENTITLED TO CAPITAL PUNISHMENT; taking the life of another does not warrant Capital Punishment in this country, only drug dealing does!!! While we applaud this long overdue Act being implemented, we cannot help but ask why Murderers are not included??? In the past, we had Capital Punishment here but it was abolished on the grounds that this was a Buddhist country and therefore it must be abolished!!!? ?
WITH ABSOLUTELY NO INSULT TO BUDDHISM, some of the wastrels think nothing of taking a human life, they deal in all kinds of treachery, rape, murder, drug trafficking, and other horrendous activities but when that happens, Buddhism and its precepts are completely forgotten or overlooked!!! We even had a HANGMAN in the days gone by, but that guy was also rendered jobless!!! Now we are calling for NOT ONE BUT TWO HANGMEN!!! WE WONDER WHY???? ?
One of America?s former First Ladies Nancy Reagan had said: ?I believe that people would be alive today if there were a death penalty.?? That is TRUTH INDEED!!!
?
?
Who is helping??
Criminals must indeed be wondering why they stayed away from our PRISONS FOR SO LONG, IT IS SUCH A GREAT PLACE TO BE IN!!! WITH INCOMING CALLS, OVERSEAS FACILITIES AVAILABLE AND ONE SMART GUY NETTING IN RS. 20,000/- A MONTH WITH ONE MOBILE PHONE; IT REALLY MUST BE THE PLACE TO STAY!!! When so much Drug Activity is going on inside the Prison, how is it that none of the authorities has ever bothered to find out WHO INSIDE THE PRISON IS HELPING THE DRUG TRAFFICKING??? THERE IS NO WAY THEY CAN CARRY THIS OUT SO SUCCESSFULLY WITHOUT INSIDE HELP!!! Don?t the authorities realize that without inside help this operation cannot be the success it is??? As the ?DAILY NEWS? rightly says, just sending offenders to prison is totally counterproductive, they need to be rehabilitated and we say this needs to be done either by the Police or the Forces or someone who will brook no nonsense from them and, more importantly, someone who CANNOT BE BRIBED!!!
?
?
Donation Syndrome?
Touching on another subject that this column has constantly dealt with is EDUCATION!!! Now the Prime Minister says the ?New Education?
Standard Act To Be Introduced Shortly? please note again it is ?Shortly? nothing, absolutely nothing is NOW!!! First, how about paying attention to whether our children can get into a school or not!!! Whether the COLOSSAL DONATIONS THAT ARE DEMANDED CAN BE PAID OR NOT!!! THE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT MUST LAY DOWN A LAW SPECIFYING THE DONATIONS REQUIRED ACCORDING TO THE TYPE OF SCHOOL AND THE GRADE THEY ARE SEEKING ENTRANCE TO!!!IF THE SCHOOLS FAIL TO ADHERE TO THE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT RULES, THIS OFFENCE SHOULD BE PUNISHABLE BY LAW!!! This is something that should have been looked into a long time ago, particularly as it would have given the really poor children a chance to go to school!!! The village schools should be graded and donations fixed at a reasonable level so the poor parents don?t have to pawn everything they own to educate their children!!! How can we talk of ?FREE EDUCATION? in a country such as this???
?
The Big Mess
We seem to be going from one mess to another!!! Colombo and its environs are FILTHY DIRTY!!! Garbage dumping continues with absolutely no concern for the environment or the cleanliness of the city and its surroundings!!! People dump garbage without any concern about the unhygienic mess they are creating, they just can?t be bothered!!! It is always someone else?s problem to keep the city clean; most of them have no personal sense of pride in the way they dress, the way they walk, the way they talk, it is a typical ?I DON?T CARE ATTITUDE?!!! THE WORST ARE THE BETEL CHEWERS AND EVEN MORE SO ARE THOSE WHO CONTINUALLY KEEP SPITTING REGARDLESS OF HOW UNHYGIENIC IT IS!!! We wonder if it has ever occurred to the Government to use the Forces to man the areas or even the entire city to curtail garbage dumping and also spitting!!! To do this effectively the Forces should be in civvies and be given the authority to impose on-the-spot fines or take the offenders to the nearest Police Station!!! Whether the Forces are occupied or not, they are being paid by the government, isn?t it; so why not put them to some good use??? LET THEM TEACH THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS TO BE PROUD OF THEIR COUNTRY!!!
?
Where are they?
How is it that ALL the unsolved mysteries have conveniently been pushed to the background??? WHERE HAVE ALL THE CULPRITS GONE TO??? WHAT HAPPENED TO UDAYANGA, MAHENDRAN, JALIYA, THE ONES BEFORE THAT, SHALILA MOONESINGHE, MALAKA DE SILVA, DUMINDA SILVA, I HAVEN?T GOT THEM ALL BUT THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY KNOW THEM ALL? AND LIKE ME, WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED??? Poor Thajudeen?s and Lasantha?s Murderers; what happened to them; are we even being told who they are??? Now they say that two CDs on Thajudeen?s murder are to be released!!! Can we ask where they were all this time and when, in the name of JUSTICE, are they going to be released??? Duminda is languishing in prison sitting out his life sentence; perhaps in 5 Star Comfort!!! Most of the political renegades are on PERMANENT BAIL!!! YES, THAT?S A NEW ONE, PERMANENT BAIL!!! If the President can roam the world while the country is in disarray, what are the people of this country expected to do??? Do we have a choice??? NO CHOICE AT ALL ? MURDERERS OR CLOWNS!!! SO WE ARE TOLD!!! THEY ARE SKILLED AT COVERING UP THEIR MISTAKES, LACK OF GOVERNANCE !!!
?
?
The big little scam
There is a big little scam being carried out by the lower ranks and apparently, it has been going on for some time now. The bus conductors, the fishmongers, the vegetable vendors, and other small-scale operators are carrying out a right royal swindle!!! Apparently, if your bus fare is 40/- and you give a 50/- rupee note, you can kiss the balance 10/- goodbye!!! If there is a balance due to you on the fish or vegetables you buy, you can rest assured that you are not going to get that balance back; whether it is 5/- 2/- 1/- or even -/50 cents!!! The balance money is very adroitly tucked away and if you protest you are even told to leave your purchases and go!!! The attitude is WHY NOT IF THE BIG GUYS CAN DO IT, WHY NOT WE??? WHAT WORKS FOR THEM, WORKS FOR?US TOO!!!
